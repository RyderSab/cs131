It is the first day and Haru and Momitchi are now attending along with the other Sohma's. Haru immediately gets harassed because of the color of his hair and has to prove that it is the natural hair color. Then a bomb is dropped, Akito is there, and he has already encountered Tohru.

This fact saddens Tohru, who had such a great relationship with her mother before she died.<br /><br />Tohru and everyone go to her mother's grave to commemorate the one year anniversary of her death. The happiness between Tohru and her friends on this sad day surprise Kyo and Yuki. Kyo begins to realize that a warm feeling to Tohru is gathering in his heart.<br /><br />Again...I am hopelessly addicted. I'm going to stop telling people to read this anymore.

An endurance run prompts the Sohma's into a new battle against one another. During this time Tohru meets Hatsuharu Sohma, an enigmatic young man with white and black hair and one violent temper...well, at times. When she first meets him he is actually quite gentle. His fight with Kyo is cut short when Yuki reveals how sick he is and Haru decides to change to his zodiac sign, the ox, so that he can carry him home. It becomes obvious to Tohru that Haru and Yuki have a special bond with one another.<br /><br />Valentines comes around and with it a multitude of chocolates for everyone. Later Momitchi decides to thank Tohru's kindness by springing for a trip to some hot springs where they meet a very strange hostess, and mother to a member of the zodiac, the one possessed by the monkey. Yuki also has a gift for Tohru to thank her for her chocolates, and a bit of tenderness is exchanged between the two.<br /><br />As more and more characters become known the series just keeps getting better. I really loved Haru, but then again I have always liked duality, being a Gemini. Something about him and Yuki's relationship intrigues me as well, just how close are the two of them? I am, without shame, hopelessly addicted to this manga. I recommend it to everyone.	2005-10-12

Haru Sohma's personality suddenly goes black in school and he begins tearing up the classroom for no obvious reason. Yuki attempts to get the reason for these actions only to learn of some dealings with Akito that Haru has had to suffer from lately. Ritsu Sohma shows up, dressed all in a pretty kimono, this Sohma member dazzles Tohru with her good looks, and horrifies her with her inherent anxiety attacks. But the truth of Ritsu lies under the surface, and Tohru is surprised to learn it. Besides that, Ritsu is also a zodiac member, the monkey, born in 1980 I estimate. Ritsu and Tohru bond after Ritsu confesses some personality flaws to Tohru. Yuki also checks up on Haru, to see how he is doing after turning black at school.<br /><br />School parent/teacher conferences are coming up, and the Sohma house is all in a panic over it. Kyo and Yuki don't know who to ask to attend, and much time is spent agonizing over what their future plans are. Tohru also breaks down a bit under the stress of all of this.<br /><br />A reoccurring dream of Yuki's past puts him into a foul mood, as does a surprise visit from his brother Ayami. In an attempt to heal their broken past Ayami offers to attend the school conferences in place of Yuki and his parents.<br /><br />Summer vacation begins with a trip to the haunted mansion for everyone. For Tohru this is a disturbing experience, as she is terrified of haunted houses. Haru helps her through it with some creative thinking, much to Yuki and Kyo's annoyance.<br /><br />More Haru...sigh... there simply isn't enough Haru in this series I'm afraid. But fans of him will get just enough of a peek into his life to be satisfied. Ritsu is a bit annoying, but you need that to balance out the strength of all the other characters... Still in love with this series though, who isn't by this point?	2005-10-12

Tohru is becoming friendlier with both Yuki and Kyo, though the boys end up fighting constantly. Fellow Sohma member, Momitchi, comes to Tohru's work to meet her, and then to a school festival organized by Tohru's class. Momitchi was born in the year of the rabbit and he shows up with Hatori Sohma, a friend of Shigure's. Yuki is made to dress up as a girl to attract attention to their exhibit, and is horrified at the prospect. But this leads to some tender moments between him and Tohru.<br /><br />Later Hatori asks Tohru to come to the main Sohma house, and this comes right after a warning from Yuki that he was responsible for erasing people's memories in the past. Tohru reluctantly goes and learns of an incident from Hatori's past that still haunts him, along with what zodiac sign he is (the dragon, which manifests itself to resemble a seahorse).<br /><br />New Years also comes and Yuki and Kyo must go to the main house to celebrate, but decide to rebel and spend the time with Tohru instead. What repercussions can this decision have when Akito learns of it?<br /><br />The series is still wonderful, even more so than I thought it was going to be. A must read for any manga fan.	2005-10-12

Kazuma decides to challenge Kyo by encouraging him to reveal his \\"true form\\" to the world to get over his own worthlessness. Tohru sees Kyo's true self, and he runs from her in shame. Rather than deal with her rejection or pity he decides it would be best to avoid her at all costs.  There are some wonderful, tearful moments that follow as she decides if he is too hideous in his natural form or not. Kyo runs off before his master departs, leaving everyone in the Sohma house in shock at his disappearance. Tohru sees Kazuma off as he speaks about the true nature of his feelings in his relationship with Kyo.<br /><br />New feelings of distrust develop in the Sohma house as both Yuki and Kagura start to stray from the others. Hatsuharu expresses his concern over Yuki's recent mood and Tohru comes just in time to lend an ear about Yuki's plans for the summer.<br /><br />Yuki takes an interest in his older brother, Ayami, and decides to bridge the gap by visiting Ayami's business.  What Tohru innocently thinks to be a uniform shop turns out to be a place devoted to male fantasies, and though this disgusts Yuki he manages to stay to chat with Ayami thanks to some distraction brought on by Ayami's assistant and Tohru's decision to try on some of Ayami's goods.<br /><br />Wow... the reading is getting so good, not that it wasn't before, but the character development is reaching a height at this point...

Tohru Honda is a young high school girl fresh from the grief of her mother's death. She tries to look on the bright side of everything, but it is rather difficult considering that due to circumstances beyond her control she is forced to live in a tent. One day on a walk to school she passes a house that has rocks decorated to look like the animals in the Chinese zodiac and she discovers that it is actually the house of Shigure Sohma, and more importantly, Yuki Sohma from her class. She makes the comment that Shigure left out the cat from the Chinese zodiac and Yuki later becomes annoyed at this, declaring he hates cats. Yuki and Tohru walk to school together and Tohru suddenly becomes a topic of conversation.<br /><br />Later when Tohru returns to her \\"Home\\" she is spotted by Shigure and Yuki, who invite her to live with them in exchange for housework. A sudden surprise from fellow Sohma family member, Kyo, causes some uproar. Kyo and Yuki have been bitter enemies since they were children and always end up fighting. In the midst of the scuffle Tohru ends up embraces Kyo and to her utter shock he turns into a cat. In the confusion she also hugs Yuki and Shigure who turn into a rat and a dog respectively... what can this mean?<br /><br />It seems that the Sohma family is cursed. For every year of the Chinese zodiac one of the family is born with an ability to change into that animal whenever they are embraced by a member of the opposite sex (other zodiac members not included) or when they are under great stress. Along with the traditional twelve animals there is also the cat, who is a rogue in the family and lives under an exclusive curse due to an old legend.<br /><br />The Sohmas want to keep Tohru around if she can keep a secret, but this must be approved by the mysterious Akito, the head of the Sohma clan. When he approves Yuki becomes suspicious, seeing as how anyone in the past who discovered the secret had to have their memories erased. What can Akito possibly be up to?  Is Tohru up to the challenge of keeping the secret, plus keeping the peace between all in the Sohma house?<br /><br />This series is so intriguing. I am completely entranced to read the next volume. There is enough mystery, what with the secret of Akito, the obvious clandestine nature of Kyo's background, and the love interest between Yuki and Tohru, and seemingly also Kyo and Tohru though I can't quite be sure yet...

Akito and Kureno head to the Sohma house to meet with Tohru, a woman whom Akito despises. They find their way to the beach, where he sees Kyo and Tohru having fun and being happy, and it unnerves him so much he decides to prolong the visit. On the way home Tohru encounters a horse on the ground. This turns out to be Isuzu Sohma, another member of the zodiac. She turns back to her female form and warns Tohru and Yuki not to tell anyone she was there and runs off half naked.<br /><br />Akito has demanded that Kyo be brought to him. Tohru thinks this is a good sign, though Kyo knows it cannot be. Yuki warns him not to lose his temper in front of Akito, but this proves futile as Akito brings up some painful memories, including a bet he and Kyo have that will ultimately seal Kyo's doom if he loses.  Kyo reveals to Akito  just how much Tohru means to him. Akito becomes enraged over the revelations of Kyo's heart, which he attempts to deny. He leaves Akito to go see her, and tries to pretend nothing bad happened.<br /><br />The Sohmas decide to end their vacation with a bang...literally, by blowing off an obscene amount of fireworks at Momitchi's suggestion. Akito makes an appearance in the middle of the night at the house and demands to see Tohru. Momitchi bars his way, and gets hurt in the process. Akito tells her of his true plans for the members of the zodiac, plans that don't include outsiders, or Kyo for that matter. Akito hurts Tohru's face and Kureno shows up to retrieve him. Akito tells Tohru Kureno is the rooster, and also that as long as he exists he (Akito) is the God of the Sohma clan. This leaves Tohru thinking into the next evening when they finally have their fireworks. She decides that she must endeavor to break the curse, no matter what it takes.<br /><br />...wow...

During the time of the first Princess Mio the land Hikami had been overrun by chaos and war. Of the two clans warring were the Hi and the Yu.

Mizuki, one of the six reincarnated warriors, points out to his stepfather (Mitsufusu) that Princess Mio the first has been reincarnated into Akira, and by all rights she should be the reigning leader. This is agreed upon by all, but it may not be in enough time as war breaks out fresh between the two clans.<br /><br />As far as manga went, this was a bit too confusing for my tastes. There was a lot of immediate action that left me befuddled, and the sheer number of characters introduced are all hard to keep straight. Yes, there are the six initial warriors, but then there are all these other people that keep getting thrown into the mix and it's just too confusing. Which side are these people on, what is there meaning in the grand scheme of things, etc. etc. Perhaps this is one of those series that I would benefit reading further into, but I don't know that I care about it enough to do so. The art is ok, but not as clean as I like it, and that combined with the aforementioned  flaws makes me think that I will not be picking up the next volume, if it ever were to be released.	2005-10-10

I could have easily seen liking it myself as a child. It's part fairy tale, part historical fiction, in a very absorbing way. Reading it now, as an adult, there are things that annoyed me. The plot was strung together in a very serialized manor, as if the author had written and published each part individually and not as a cohesive whole. The overall story was good, but obviously geared at young girls fantasies. I feel that the author needs a bit of time to polish off her style, as there were dialogue issues here and there. As an adult fantasy, it feels about a 3. As a young adult fantasy, about a 4. I'll split the difference and give it a 3.5 just for arguments sake.<br /><br />I think children will love this book though, I know I would have.	2005-10-02

I recently began to work in a book store in the young adults science-fiction section. The week I began working there the second book in the Inheritance Trilogy \\"Eldest\\" was released in hard cover. Naturally, all of the buzz that Eldest was making made me curious to pick up the series, so I started with the first book in the series, \\"Eragon\\". I was pleasantly surprised with the story that I discovered.<br /><br />The book begins with Eragon's trip into the Spine on a hunting expedition. Eragon is a 15 year old bastard son of Selena, a woman who left him to be raised by his Uncle Garrow and Aunt Marion. On this fateful trip into the Spine Eragon finds what he thinks to be a harmless precious stone and decides to take it home to see if it will fetch a price with the traders. Some time later he discovers that it is, in fact, a dragon's egg when it hatches in his room one evening, and he has more surprises in store for him when he realizes that the dragon has formed a bond with his mind, one that he is unable and unwilling to break. This bond comes with a price though; as far as Eragon knows all of the dragon riders had died out a long time ago, as all of the dragons were virtually extinct. So where, in fact, did this egg come from?<br /><br />Eragon is forced into a quest when a band of Urgals slaughters his family and wreaks havoc upon his village. He decides to seek vengeance for the murder of his family and begins a quest across Alagaesia to find those responsible. He sets out with Brom, a man whom he believes to be an ordinary story teller but in truth knows a bit too much about dragon lore and truths to really be all that he seems to be. Together, they will discover that underneath everything they know is an underlying plot that will change the empire and discover some new intrigues along the way.<br /><br />This book turned out to be a delight, well worth the read in my estimation. I enjoyed it so much that I had to pick up Eldest immediately following. The characters are engaging, flawed and perfected, people that you actually end up giving a damn about. The story is straight forward fantasy fare, with some new twists and interesting explorations of typical fantasy occurrences. It actually reminded me a touch of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain series, though I can't really say why, perhaps some of the way in which the material was presented. There were parts in it that were clearly aimed at younger readers, but the fact that the author was 17 when he wrote it may be why there are those initial flaws. The way that some of the dialogue came off was a bit clich&eacute; of the fantasy genre. I'll be honest, there was some dialogue that was so cheesy I shook my head abashed, I just couldn't believe the author had written it, or that an editor let it fly. However, this book is intended at young audiences, and this is typical with that genre. On the other hand, I have read fantasy that was aimed at adults that was written much worse than what I encountered here, so in lieu of that I am likely to dismiss these slights. Overall, I am hesitant to give it five stars, but four seems under doing it. Figure 4 and a half or so, only because of the slight imperfections in the dialogue.

This is an apt way to introduce you to this  book that catalogues a fictional account of the life of Roman born artist Artemisia Gentileschi. Interwoven in Vreeland's style of wit and superb detail are the factual experiences that occurred to this unfortunate woman as she slaved under the patriarchal dominance of the post-renaissance art world. But the determination behind this artist's desire to triumph against insurmountable odds is best summed up by the aforementioned statement.<br /><br /> \\" The real principles of living are not in the Scriptures. They are in blood ties, histories, sayings, innuendos, surreptitious looks, clandestine agreements, and hot clasped hands. When you learn to recognize them, life will become easier, rich in opportunities and rewards. Be wise, Artemisia. Be watchful. Look in their faces and show no fear.\\"<br /><br />For those of you who do not know this tremendous artist, this is a spectacular way to learn a bit about her and who she might have been. I personally have read about her before this, but I enjoyed this book as a means of getting the gory details of her life to the masses in an interesting way. The real Artemisia was a woman born to a Roman artist, Orazio, who taught her how to paint young. When she was in her teens she studied the style of Caravaggio and the latest trends in perspective under Orazio's fresco partner Agostino Tassi. Tassi's name went down in history when he began to rape Artemisia repeatedly, promising her that he would marry her in order to get her to acquiesce to his demands more smoothly. What happened ultimately is that he denied her the chance to salvage her honor and because of this her father decided to sue him for rape and slander, among other things. As you can imagine, in the 1600's her reputation suffered from this event, and she was subjected to numerous torment at the hands of her peers, neighbors, friends, and even had to endure torture in the trial by having the sibille bind her fingers until they bled profusely. This is where Vreeland starts the novel, at this tumultuous and life altering point in Artemisia's young life. It seems she has studied the transcripts of the trial well, as there are several details I had read about previously added to the court scenes in the book.<br /><br />What is very interesting about this particular book is how destructive this event is on this poor woman's future relationships with men, particularly the one with her father who becomes somewhat estranged after the circumstances of the trial escalate to a point of no return. This, is in fact, disastrous for Artemisia, who can never quite bring herself to trust a man again, even though she is shortly later married off to a Florentine painter to get her out of Rome. Even though she does struggle to get beyond the rape and the shame of the whole ordeal she can`t quite let go of her anger, and it is this anger that she holds against her father that stands out the most throughout the course of this book. This affects everything she does, and she spends a good deal of time running from her father rather than the past. She even denies her daughter the relationship with her grandfather for a large portion of her young life.<br /><br />This is an engaging story and a quick read. Certainly not perfect, but a nice way to spend a quiet evening. I recommend it to fans of contemporary fiction and historical fiction alike.<br /><br /> \\"Have you ever felt abandoned by God?\\"<br /><br />  Her chin pulled back a little, the only hint of her surprise.

This is a hard book for me to discuss, as I have very mixed emotions about it.<br /><br />Let's talk first about the world West has invented. It is a tragic world, one that practically enslaves women under a patriarchal regime and shapes them to be pretty and attentive for the men's purposes alone. Many of the men are boorish half wits who can't see past their own egos, while many of the female characters are duly submissive and do not  think for themselves. I understand the point of this, but it makes it difficult to get into. However, the descriptions of the Annagarian Dominion, the countryside, the court, the people, the fashions, the art are all lush and absorbing. I definitely tip my cap to West for setting up the mood and feel of this world.<br /><br />Second, I would like to talk about the way she structured her sentences and the lengthy prose that told the story in. This is not going to be for everyone. It seemed that in many of the other reviews I have read on this book that seems to be what kills it for some, while what makes it beautiful for others to read. Personally, I love description, but to this degree of detail was simply too much. I found the book heavy and dense, and though the story was enough to keep me interested I found myself getting lost in many of the other passages in between. I would go for pages on end and realize I had not absorbed any of it, nor caring that I didn't by that point. I just couldn't get into it after the first 400 pages or so. I found that some days I would plow through 50 pages, but then I wouldn't pick it up for a week or more, or would only read 3 or 4 pages over the next few days. This is NOT inherent to me. I usually read  pretty constant, most weeks finishing off at least one book. In this case I barely comprehended the last 300 pages of the story and skimmed through the last 60 or so just to see how it ended, to only realize that I had not gleaned enough of the plot to appreciate the nuances of the ending. This, to a large degree, is due to the style she worked in.<br /><br />Third, the character development. I'm sorry to say, but their were only about 6 or 7 characters that really stood out to me at all, many of whom were the female leads. Perhaps this was because West spent so much time in their development, and many of the women I liked were introduced relatively early in the book. However, I take issue with the fact that the book is 764 pages long (mass market paperback) and up until the mid 600 pages she was still introducing characters. This is hard to follow, even with a key in the front that explains briefly who all of the characters are in the book. (*Note: Whenever I see one of those guides I usually shudder, because it's always a book like this where the author is constantly bringing in new people. Not that I mind an introduction or two later in a story if it is pertinent to the plot development, but when the author still introduces numerous characters so late in the book I have a hard time keeping them all straight and generally lose interest as a result.)<br /><br />Lastly, the overarching plot.  The story is fantastic, but it would not have been so if she would have chosen not to introduce one of the main characters (and plot drivers, as I like to call her) right away. In the very beginning of the book there is a child born to a woman who was taken advantage of by a demon lord of the Kin. The half-demon girl proves to be important later in the story, and up until the end of the first \\"book\\" within the book (about 80 pages into this story). I was entranced in the beginning by this plot line; it seemed as if the book was going to be something right up my alley. But then in the second \\"book\\" within the book the story suddenly shifts to detail the lives of those in the Annagarian Court. For a while this confused me, what had this to do with the beginning part of the story? But I am usually a patient reader, so I kept on with it, figuring the connection would be madeeventually. What irritated me was that the connection between the two stories does not become apparent  for about 300 pages after the last mentioning of the demon child and then the author doesn't do enough with the character to make her relevant. This felt an utter waste to me, as if West had purposely structured it to keep your attention for the large part of the book by starting it off with the demon child storyline and then switching to the other part of the world. I know it's a literary trick, but it's annoying none the less. I know that had that introduction not been there I would have abandoned the book long before that point. As for the rest of the storyline, a few political marriages, much talk of war, an assassination or two, more talk of war, a hostage situation, political intrigue through usury and machination, more talk of war... you get the picture. Honestly, I was just reading it to find out what happened to Kiriel, the half demon child, and what the connection was between her and Diora, the jewel of the Annagarian Court.<br /><br />I am told that this is not the best series to read when starting with West. I am told to read the Hunter's Oath and Hunter's Death books as an introduction, to save these for when I am more accustomed to her writing style. Perhaps that would have been an apt idea. However, I did not do it that way, and though I am impressed with the author's skill I don't know that I will be rushing to read the sequels any time soon. I do own them, so I may get to them in time, but for now I am picking up something a bit lighter and easier to read. As it was this one took me between six and seven weeks to slog through, and that is generally about 5 weeks too long for me to remain interested in a book. If I planned on reading the sequels now I would probably have to reread this one in order to understand the latter books, which in my minds makes the sequels that are sitting on my shelf unreadable any time in the near future. Like I said earlier, I have mixed emotions about this. While I would recommend it to someone  I would also caution them about these defects first, and, oddly enough, I probably will read the sequels at another time, because the story was interesting and I love fantasy stories, I just won't be expecting to read through it at breakneck pace next time. 3 and a half stars seems about right for this, shying on the side of liking purely for the beginning of the story which did intrigue me, it but still keeping my critical eye intact.uld be made eventually.

This book was loaned to me by a friend who swore that I would have to read it \\"with one hand free\\". While the story is very erotic, and the sex scenes are very real and compelling, I would not wholly agree with that statement. This, in part, is due to the fact that love scenes between men and women no longer do anything for me sexually. I prefer erotic writings between two women, and, though there were a few added to this book to spice things up (for me anyways) there were definitely not enough to arouse me to free one hand.<br /><br />The story, however, is well written. It was an easy, delightful read, one that I polished off in two sittings. It catalogues the life of a young writer coming into her own sexuality, seizing whatever moments of transient, sensual bliss that she comes across. This book is somewhat autobiographical, cultivated from Di Prima's own experiences as a college drop out who, annoyed with the system of 1950`s education, decided to instead pursue writing full time. The main character in the story parallels her life to such a degree that the author had even named her heroine \\"Di Prima\\". The character Di Prima also flits about in the underworld of 1950's New York, inhabiting skeevy, infested pads with multiple people, coffee houses, book stores, parks, smoked out bar scenes, forests, fields, and (on one occasion) a country farm. Where the truth is obscured in this bohemian world of sex, drugs, and (pre) rock and roll is only up to the reader's decision. I know little about Di Prima myself, so I like to look at this as a fairly inventive, fictional piece of writing.<br /><br />This is definitely a worthwhile read. I must admit, were I more inclined to heterosexual love scenes, I would have, indeed, read this with one hand free, seeing as how in every single chapter is a different, vivid description of one of her many sexual encounters. If you are inclined to beat writing, this is a canon of that genre. If you are a fan of erotica, how have you not read this one yet? Read it in a room, alone, or with a partner. It will get your juices flowing, if you pardon the pun.u not read this one yet? Read it in a room, alone, or with a partner. It will get your juices flowing, if you pardon the pun.	2005-08-30

There are hundreds of people in this Other London. Thousands maybe, People who come from here or people who have fallen through the cracks. I'm wandering around with a girl called Door, her bodyguard, and her psychotic grand vizier.\\"<br /><br />So begins a fantastic adventure of four people who find themselves thrown together in the most bizarre of circumstances. Richard Mayhew, the reluctant hero, must summon up whatever strength he possesses to become a suitable companion for Door, daughter of Portico of the House of Arch, after her entire family has been ruthlessly slaughtered as a backlash for Portico's attempt to unite the baronies and fiefdoms of Lower London. Unable to understand the reason for the brutality Door embarks on a quest to discover the murderer and his true goal. After an attempt on her life, Door hires a bodyguard named Hunter, the most famous and skilled bodyguard of all Lower London, and also employs the Marquis de Carabas, a man whom Richard suspects of being in on the plot. Together, the four set out to find the Angel Islington, a man who may be able to guide Door in finding out who is at fault for the murder of her family.<br /><br />The story is one that sweeps you up from the first page. The tragic killing of Door's family by two assassins, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, and the subsequent chase of Door through the streets of Upper London, is a clever introduction that nicely balances the ordinary humdrum of Richard Mayhew's typical existence. It sets the pulse for the remainder of the book to one of fast paced action, drama, suspense, and dark humour. I had a hard time putting the book down after the first 50 pages, and I was sorry to see it end. The altered world of Lower London made me think a bit of classic fantasy stories of traveling through altered dimensions (such as Alice in Wonderland or The Wizard of Oz), and the crafting of the dialogue and the story made me think a bit of Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast at times, but the story was so originally Gaiman it was easy to overlook some of these literary nods.

Shadow is released from prison a few days early when he learns that his wife, Laura, has died in a car accident with his former boss.  Numb from the news he heads home to get her affairs in order and attend her funeral. On the way he meets a man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday who warns him that a storm is coming and hires him for a job as a bodyguard. At first Wednesday just appears to be an aging con-man, but Shadow quickly begins to see that Wednesday is not what he appears to be, and is in fact a magic wielding god. Thus begins a trek across the states to enlist help for an impending Spiritual war against the old gods and the new gods.<br /><br />During the course of the book Shadow also experiences many difficulties when he learns that he has, in fact, resurrected his dead wife from the grave with the help of a gift given to him by one of the people he meets along the way. Laura periodically shows up to give Shadow support along with pain as he unwillingly remembers the manner in which she died. This, combined with periodic dreams and bizarre events that occur (and an intriguing cast of characters and Gods), culminates in a fantastic story that will keep you entertained from cover to cover.<br /><br />A friend of mine introduced me to the phenomenal writing that is Gaiman's work.

Her strict moral upbringing causes her severe grief when her mother has to enroll her into school at the age of seven. The children, the teachers, and even the administrators find her preaching attitude a bit unnerving.

The Dutch ship in foreign waters, Erasmus, is manned by a crew fighting to stay alive. This is a perfect metaphor to foreshadow events that will later take place throughout the book. The captain of the ship, John Blackthorne, is the first English pilot to get through Magellan's pass and sail in Asian waters. After the ship is docked in the harbor in Japan it is then that the dozen men on board begin to realize that the battle on land will be much more difficult than any they have faced at sea.<br /><br />How does a culture handle the sudden presence of new outsiders? Especially when they have completely different beliefs and ways of life? This is something that Clavelle explores cleverly, dealing with the English and Dutch sea fearers as aliens that must be feared and scorned. When the crew of the Erasmus first arrives in Japan everyone is leery of them. The local samurai and citizens treat them with cold friendliness and utter gravity, and even the local Portuguese Christians look on the intruders as something to fear.<br /><br />This is a book fraught with political struggles and intrigue, the corruption of the religious leaders present, lush descriptions of Japan in the 16th century, and exploration of medieval Japanese cultures and the samurai way of life. Much of the story flows around Blackthorne's maturation from a swarthy, brooding, ego-driven macho man into a smooth, quiet tempered, harmonious, esteemed samurai of distinction. There are several other interesting characters that help to develop this incredible story. This is a book that should be read at least once by everyone interested in Japanese culture, war epics, action driven plots, and historical fiction/drama.	2005-04-07

Henri is an idealistic young soldier who spends the better part of the war killing chickens for his Emperor's table. He becomes intrigued with Bonaparte and would willingly give his heart and soul to him if he requested it. Villanelle is the daughter of a Venetian boatman who has the ill luck of being born with webbed feet. When she grows up her luck changes when she becomes employed in a gambling house and looses her heart to one of the patrons there. How these two come together is told through a split narrative in which the two characters alternate their experiences of love, loss, and, ultimately, freedom from all who have power over their passions.<br /><br />The plot was intriguing, but I struggled to get involved in the story in the beginning. This comes from the fact that I have never been terribly sympathetic to Napoleon, and as Henry's hero worship is a clear plot element in the first half of the book it was difficult for me, personally, to not be disgusted with him. I was far more interested by Villanelle's narratives, particularly that of her love affair with the Venetian noblewoman who manages to steal her heart, literally. This may not have been the best introduction to Winterson's work, but it was not enough of a deterrent to swear me off of exploring her further either, and the setting was enjoyable. Overall, 3.5 stars feels about right.	2005-02-15

Margarethe Fisher is the mother of two young girls. Ruth, an  heavyset and ungainly girl with the wit of a small child and Iris, the younger of the two, unattractive, quiet, and always the keeper of her mute older sister. When Margarethe's husband dies in England, the result of a mass murder from a business practice gone awry, she must flee to the country of her birth with her two daughters to escape the teeming mass of angry villagers. In Haarlem, Holland Margarethe attempts to solicit charity by trading in on her families good name, but she is met with ill success. Eventually, she is granted charity from a struggling religious iconographic artist and his young assistant who takes them in so he can paint Iris for his patrons.  It is through the Master that the family meets Cornelius Van den Meer, a rich patron who lives with his wife, Henrika, and his young, isolated daughter, Clara. Van den Meer becomes interested in Iris, thinking her a suitable playmate for his daughter, one that might teach Clara the English language, so he uproots Margarethe and her daughters to his home and installs them there for this purpose.<br /><br />The story is a take on the classic Cinderella faerie tale. All of these characters merge well into the Cinderella story, and identifying the similarities between the original and the contemporary retelling was something I reveled in. Maguire has cleverly expanded on the roots of the story by setting it in Holland in the 1700's during the height of tulip madness. Maguire's skilled prose circulates around characters that seem ideal for the time period. Van den Meer is an investor enmeshed in the risky business of the tulip market. Master Schoonmaker is a disenchanted oil painter disappointed with the recent secularization of the art world. Even Margarethe seems to be plucked from the past, with her ambitious schemes and her refusal to acknowledge things unseemly for a lady. And then there is Clara to consider, who takes on the role of the famed cinder girl. For the better part of the book she is a mewling, spoiled, self-centered child who has been cosseted to the point that she refuses to set foot out of doors. But due to circumstance that feed well into the advancement of the plot she takes on a much more similar role to the kitchen maid and house keeper we have all come to know as Cinderella. The story is largely told from the perspective of Iris, \\"the ugly stepsister\\" in the book. It follows her through this intricately embellished world of Holland and concentrates much of the time in the studio of Master Schoonmaker and elaborates on her impressions of the events that parallel the Cinderella happenstances. Fraught with intrigue and mysticism this is a book that will delight readers of fiction and faerie tale alike.med cinder girl.

Up until now there have been authors that have taken on this classic mythology through the males point of view. But this retelling narrates the book from the ladies of the Arthurian legends side of the story....And it's about time.<br /><br />Marion Zimmer Bradley has created a new, refreshed identity for the Ladies of Camelot and Avalon. The book examines the events of the mythos from the females perspective.  Many of these characters have, until now, been portrayed as wives, seductresses,  enchantresses, and harlots. But this new take identifies the women of Camelot in different and less derogatory roles; that of mother, daughter, sister, lover, priestess, queen, and friend.<br /><br />There are several different generations of phenomenal characters that make up the greater tapestry of this book.<br /><br />Viviane- Lady of the Lake at Avalon, the holy isle dedicated to the Goddess.  It is her visions that influence the shaping of the future of Britain in the most unusual ways.<br /><br />Igraine- Viviane's younger half sister, daughter of Taliesin the Merlin, and wife to the Romanized Duke of Cornwall. She bends her will to whatever her sister asks of her, even if it means to sacrifice her own virtue.<br /><br />Morgause- Igraine's younger sister and Viviane's half sister. Destined for more than to rot in isolated Tintagel, her ambitions take her to the northern Isles of Orkney where she makes the appropriate sacrifices to affirm her place in this tale.<br /><br />Morgaine- daughter of Igraine and the Duke of Cornwall. She is taken to serve the Goddess at a young age by Viviane, but renounces her position as the next Lady of the Lake when Viviane's visions prove too much for her to endure.<br /><br />Gwenhwyfar- Pious and virtuous she longs to Christianize Arthur`s court and purge the followers of the goddess from the realm. But she is unable to reconcile her feelings for Lancelet for what is good for the future of Britain. She longs desperately to give Arthur the heir the country needs and she is unable to produce.<br /><br />Elaine- Daughter of Pellinore, and Gwenhwyfar's cousin. She is desperate to gain Lancelet's admiration and love, even if she has to resort to \\"Sorcery\\" to attain it, or give up her first born daughter to the Goddess.<br /><br />Raven- Priestess of Avalon and friend of Morgaine, she has undertaken a vow of silence, but always seems to prophesize what is to come at just the right moment.<br /><br />Niniane- Daughter of Taliesin the Merlin. The successor to the Lady of the Lake and lover to Gwydion. What does one really feel when they know they are second choice to another?<br /><br />Nimue- Daughter of Elaine and Lancelet. Destined to fulfill her mother's vow and take her place in Avalon under Niniane's teachings, she must give herself up to the Merlin of Britain in order to implement Morgaine's visions, but can she keep herself from losing herself to him as well?<br /><br />The story is mostly told from Morgaine's perspectives.  This character is largely influential on the events that occur throughout the story, either through her premonitions that come by way of the Sight or the enforcement of her unassailable will. Many of the cruxes in the story come from the juxtaposition of Morgaine And Gwenhwyfar, who serve as symbols of the struggles of the two religions in the story, the Christians and the Celts. Both spend the better part of the book applying the men as tools in order to establish their respective religions as the dominant moral force in Britain. Through their struggles the classic events prevalent to the Arthurian tales are expressed in a new manner, many with Celtic twists on them. I don't want to spoil the retelling of the conception of Mordred, the quest for the Holy Grail, or the romantic love trials that came as unexpected surprises to me, even though I have read several different authors takes on this classic mythology. Rest assured, this was the best version I have read to date, one that reinvented the Arthurian legends .best version I have read to date, one that reinvented the Arthurian legends .	2005-01-20

Gustine is a 15 year old prostitute by night, pottery factory employee by day. She toils in relative obscurity, submitting to her landlord who employs her as a dress lodger, all for the benefit of her handicapped son who was born with an unusual defect. One night she meets Henry, a young doctor with a haunting past, who is desperate for a corpse to supply his students for medical study.<br /><br />The story is set in a time when the medical community had to balance the ethics of bodily dissection with the superstitious nature of the majority of the population. As a result of the affection many showed their loved ones most doctors were unable to acquire human corpses to further the field of anatomical knowledge, and many had to resort to grave robbing in order to be able to understand the physiology of the body.  This is a major plot element, and the reason Gustine and Henry form an alliance of sorts early on in the story. The writing is chilling at times. The descriptions of the diseases are very vivid and grotesque, not for the faint of heart. The subtle ways in which the author  mentions the gore and internal workings of the human body were interesting.<br /><br />This is one of those books most will either love or hate. I'm somewhere in the middle myself. I thought I would like this book, by every indication I should of; this kind of story is usually right up my alley. But this time the book just didn't do it for me. The characters never seemed to become real or engaging. They congealed together in an unusual way, but never seemed to leap from the page as they should of in order to carry a plot of this magnitude. I found myself finishing it just to see where the story went, not because I cared about what happened to the characters. This may work for some readers, but it was mediocre for my tastes.	2004-12-27

The book is a fictionalized account of the life of murderess Mary Saunders who was born in 1748 in London. After an unfortunate encounter with a ribbon seller leaves her pregnant at 14 her mother turns her out of the home to live on the streets. With the help of a prostitute named Doll, Mary becomes accustomed to the life of selling herself to the dregs of London society in order to eke out a living for herself. But an ailment becomes the turning point for her as she must flee from London and try to better herself in order to survive.<br /><br />This was one of those books I picked up for a lark and ended up enjoying. I found myself carrying it around with me everywhere I went, and compulsively read it in my spare moments. The plot woven by Donoghue around the few facts and suppositions that remain about the real Mary Saunders is dramatic and engaging. The writing is poignant and fluid and compelling from cover to cover. I recommend to fans of classic English literature and contemporary fans alike, this book has a bit for all to appreciate.	2004-12-15

The story, though written after Mercedes Lackey's Arrows series, is set before his debut in those books, and illustrates his earlier experiences as a thief in training.<br /><br />Skif grows up under his Uncle's thumb, an orphan with a debt to pay to a cheap, conniving relative. After some dealings of his uncle goes wrong Skif takes the oppurtunity to escape to the street and to a gang who teaches him the intricasies of thievery. They soon become like the family he never had.<br /><br />The story is sweet and endearing, as we follow Skif through the streets of the capital. It does lack a bit of substance though. The time he spends as an initial herald in training is not as flushed out as I normally like. And his quest for revenge, though deserved, felt rushed and awkward. It is still a great addition to the world of Valdemar though, one I would recommend reading in concert with the Heralds of Valdemar trilogy (Arrow's of the Queen, Arrow's Flight, and Arrow's Fall.)	2004-12-12

The story centers around a woman named Gwendolen Harleth whose family has lost their fortunes, a young jewish singer named Mirah who is on the run from her father, and Daniel Deronda, who rescues the young jewess from drowning herself. The plot draws the three together as if they are bound by fate, while Eliot continues to add side characters and subplots to spice up the book.<br /><br />The storyline was enough to keep my interest, but there were overlying thematic issues that caused my attention to waver. I found several passages in the book weighty and overdone, and there was many times that I found I had read pages of description without having any of it sinking in, nor caring by the time I had realized. I did, however, find the overall plot centering around the three main characters of enough depth and feeling to keep me focused on them, and I liked Eliot's story telling ability enough to make me want to read more of her. Perhaps this is not the best book to read when beginning with George Eliot. I give it 3 and a half stars.	2004-10-06

When Melisande summons Phedre's aid to find her son Imriel de la Courcel after he has gone missing, she offers up the only thing that could tempt Phedre to undertake such a task, the location where she might discover the clue to breaking Hyacinthe's curse, the name of God.<br /><br />Her search leads her to Aragonia, where she unearths a child slave trade market that has been selling D'angeline children to foreign lands for high profits. To follow the trail is to venture first to Menekheten, then to hell itself. Phedre must decide whether the gain outways the risk as her relationship with her perfect companion, Joscelin, is put to the test and her own sanity stretches to the brink.<br /><br />I didn't think this series could have gotten any better than \\"Kushiel's Chosen\\" but I was happily mistaken. \\"Kushiel's Avatar\\" is a stunning book, fraught with peril, sacrifice, and yearning unlike anything I have read before. I blew away all of my expectations and sets a new precedent for the fantasy novel. This was, simply put, a fantastic conclusion to a phenomenal series, one that showcase Carey's skills with such resonance. I found myself completely drawn into this spellbinding world of intrigue and opulance once again, and also found a pleasant new addition in the presence of Imriel, whose story is so compelling and heart rendering that there was several times I had to put the book down to clear my head and readjust my thoughts to accommodate him. This, for me, was a fabulous book, and a great end to a treasure of a story.<br /><br />I almost wish that Carey would pursue the story of Imriel in a follow up series, as I found him so ingaging and so haphazardly thrown into the world his mother had created for him against his will. If it never happens, I will not hold it against Carey, as she has already made me a stalwart fan with this series. I am sure that I will be reading anything she writes after this, and I am a little sorry that the story is over because I am going through \\"Kushiel\\" withdrawl already. This is a must read.

As with \\"Kushiel's Dart\\", this book follows the story of the courtesan Phedre no Delaunay de Montreve, now a peer of the realm thanks to her former lord Delaunay's generous inheritance. She has found herself thrust back into Terre d'Ange society and must now learn to cope with her new status as well as the fact that everyone she encounters now knows she is an agent for Ysandre de la Courcel, Queen of Terre d'Ange. She also has found an impossible love with her protector Joscelin, who has sworn himself to the Cassiline brotherhood, and despite the fact that he has broken nearly all of his vows he cannot bring himself to break the last one that would allow him to be Phedre's consort. Added to that, she is also trying desperately to find a way to save her Tsingano childhood friend Hyacinthe, who had given his life to save hers from a geis curse that would enslave him for 800 years.<br /><br />Into this mix enters Melisande Shahrizai, the only patron who Phedre has ever loved, and also the woman who betrayed her for her own personal gains. A challenge comes to Phedre in the form of her sangoire cloak, a gift that was given to Phedre when she entered into the service of Naamah. Phedre knows that Melisande is tempting her. If she reenters the service of Naamah she may lose Joscelin in the process, but it may be the only way to unearth the plot that still threatens the Queen, and in return discover just where Melisande has fled to. It is a hard choice, but despite all she has to risk Phedre still makes the decision that will provide all of the answers she seeks to save Terre d'Ange.<br /><br />This is a worthy follow up to \\"Kushiel's Dart.\\" It continues the masterfully concieved saga that Carey has created with a vengence. I found it to be more satisgying than the first, and was engrossed from the beginning to the very end, which frankly brought tears to my eyes. Phedre is a wonderfully flawed heroine, flawed in the fact that she cannot forgive the one who has brought her the most grief, but she cannot bring herself to forget her either, and this nearly becomes her downfall at several points in this book. There are also several moments that test her indomitable will as her travels take her to La Serenissima, Illyria, Kriti (the better part of Europa for that matter) and even to the brink of insanity as she festers in a jail cell on a lone island and endures the theatalos ceremony of Kriti which shows her all of the despair she has caused during her life. Phedre is constantly tested and challenged throughout this book and comes through the challenges scarred and in pain. But through it all she still knows that the fate of Terre d'Ange once again is in her hands, and only she can thwart what Melisande had already set in motion.<br /><br />If you have read \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" and loved it, there is no way you cannot pick this one up.

The Dowayne of the Cereus House first called her \\"a whore's unwanted get\\" when she was just a babe. Phedre grew up in the night court, surrounded by the ways of the courtesans, but because of a flaw in her left eye she knew her future would not be among them. It wasn't until a nobleman out of favor with the court identified her as one blessed by the hand of Kushiel that she began to find who, and what, she really was.<br /><br />  After her marque is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay she begins to understand that there are plots everywhere to be unearthed. He teaches her to observe and to detect what lies underneath, as well as the arts of the night court, especially that of Phedre's lord Kushiel, who teaches his own to experience pleasure commingled with pain. With her true gift she uncovers a plot to dethrone the current monarchy of Terre D'Ange, a plot put into action by a peer of the realm and the only patron that Phedre has ever truly desired.<br /><br />  Phedre must be gotten rid of, for she is the only one who can prove of the horrible deceptions leading up to the demise of the kingdom. And with the aid of a stoic clerk of the Cassiline brotherhood she must find her way back to her home to prove not only the underlying plot, but that she is not a murderess as well. And she must do it in time to stop an impending war with the neighboring nations.<br /><br />  I thouroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the others in the series. Some might find it a touch long in some areas, but I found nothing that detracted from the basic story of a young woman who must prove herself against all odds and finds love in the strangest of circumstances. I encourage anyone who enjoys intrigue, mystery, romance, action, fantasy, humor, and one of the greatest villainess of all time to read this book. My only gripe was that two of my favorite characters fell to bad circumstances (one was killed early in the book and one fell under a yeshuite curse in the end of the book) but these elements added to my interest rather than subtracted.
