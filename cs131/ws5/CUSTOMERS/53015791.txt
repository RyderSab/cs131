It strives for completeness and is 600+ pages. But because of that and of it's academic German language, is quite unreadable. Minor authors are mentioned in 10 lines. In that short space only the 3 major claims of their book can be repeated, but the consistency of their arguments is lost. Having read 7 of these minor authors, the reader will be lost in details too.<BR>No real effect to synthesis or analysis is made.<BR>The book can be used as a whoiswho in &quot;decline history&quot; and as an encyclopedia. <BR>Don't expect it to be a good read. It's very putdownable.	2004-02-29

He describes their commendable achievements first an then goes in depth into their not so nice qualities too. The account he gives is lively and alive with quite private details of the 12 men.

I'm afraid this biography is best characterized as compact, or even shallow. For a truly interesting biography virtually every sentence should be (and can easily be) expanded into 5 lines or a paragraph. And then perhaps the book would begin to describe and explain satisfactory about what now is only mentioned or hinted at.<br />I'm afraid, though, there is not much choice in Thaw-biographies - yet. And that leaves you with a tough choice. The book is not exactly worth the money, but it is better then nothing at all.<br />Good luck	2002-01-29

He uses written sources (penitentials, hagiography, exempla, catechisms and the like) to describe the &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; of the illiterati. In the process the reader gets a very lifely image of hell, purgatory, the Last Judgement, visiting demons, the use of saints, the roles of clergy in society. Important writers as Ceasarius of Heisterbach, Gregorius The Great, Honorius of Autun, Burchard of Worms and Dante are discussed. <br />But though Gurevich succeeds in painting a vivid image, I cannot give 5 points for this book. First of all, Gurevich makes his theories plausible, but the book lacks substantial evidence. Secondly non-Russian readers will find the style Gurevich uses indirect and repetetive, which makes this interesting book simply (and unnecessary) &quot;hard work&quot; to read.	2001-06-08

Well actually, the untranslated, Dutch, version is.<br />The book gives a good overview of the history of the Low Countries, starting with the Kelts, Romans and invading Germans, covering the Bourgondian Age, the dominion of the Habsburgers, the struggle for freedom, the golden age, the changing relationships between what is now called Belgium and the Netherlands, the importance of the religion and tolerance, ending the description in the mid 1990's. <br />The book covers political history, but economic, social, cultural, and religious history as well. The language is clear, and no prior knowledge of this region, or its history is required. Four stars and not five, because the part dealing with the 20th century has less analytical qualities then the high standard set by the rest of the book. <br />At the end of this readable and engaging book you'll know more about Dutch en Belgium history then most inhabitants of these countries do, and you'll understand some of the basic concepts still strong in Dutch foreign policies, and some of the structural internal problems Belgium still faces today.	2001-01-27

Lewis wrote it in 1955, after he had finished the other Narnia books, except the last one: The Great Battle (1956).<br />The book tells how two kids are sent to another world, by a weaked and coward magician, because he wants to experiment with magic rings, that he doen't really understand. On their travels they encouter a evil witch, which they unfortunately bring back with them to their own unmagical world, and even more sadly to the new magical world of Narnia, where she will be the cause of much sorrow in the later Narnia books.<br />Lewis uses a language that can be understood by kids, in such a way that it enchants grown-ups as well. Perhaps it takes some time, before this first book really gathers speed, but when it does, the magic of Narnia and Aslan is very powerfull, pulling the reader inside the book. The pictures made by Pauline Baynes are wonderfully supportive.	2000-12-31

It shows the chaos that emerges as millions of people disappear, how people try to figure out what happend, how some re-find their fate in God, and how the Anti-Christ emerges. It's a well structured, swift paced book that focusses on world events as well as on personal experiences of people. I could not put it down, even though I wanted to. <br />The downside of the book is that (though cleverly hidden behind all the action) it still will be felt by the non-believer, that the authors are hoping to persuade people to their Christian believes. That spoils some of the uncomplicated fun of reading this. On the upside: for those who DO believe in Christ this will make the book a warm bath that will strengthen their beliefs.<br />On the whole I liked Beauseigneur's Christ Clone Trilogy better, because it offered more food for the mind, appeared better researched in worldly matters such as the United Nations politics, and didn't seem so focussed on the conversion of people in the book and outside of it.	2000-12-31

What if earth, after millennia, leaves a part of space in which an unknown phenomena has (up untill then) dampened the IQ of the earthlings?

Are they glad, can they cope with it, and what does it do to society? Poul Anderson explored these questions in 1954, in a book that is still fresh today. He succeeds very well in describing the changes in thinking and feeling patterns in people that evolve from normal to incredible high IQ. A good and interesting read, that is highly probable, once you have accepted the premisse. It'll set your mind in motion.	2000-12-29

Up untill now, that is. The Fall of Terok Nor lacks some of the normal quality I've come to expect from those two writers.<br />My main complaint is the pace of the book, which is very slow, because of the build in repetition and redundancy. It is best shown with an example. First you'll read about a crucial plot development concerning an attack on Vash, then about how the DS9 staff speculates about what happened to Vash while waiting for her to reagain consciousness, third about how Vash explains what happend to her to the DS9 staff, forth how Dax and Dashir discuss what has happened to Vash and what Vash told them about the events afterwards, then how Jake and Nog come up with the same conclusion but with different clues, and last how Jake and Dax explain the whole thing to Benjamin Sisko in order to get him to take some actions. Are you still with me? I really had trouble staying with the book at this point. The Fall of Terok Nor could have easily been half its size, without lossing crucial points in the action, because of this type of narrative structure.<br />The upside of the repetition is, I guess, that someone who is totally unfamiliar with DS9, get's a fair chance to get to know all the characters, and their normal interaction, likes and dislikes. So perhaps for those readers the redundancy is really functional. <br />I do hope the rest of the series will speed up, since everyone knows the characters by now, and, ahum, because I've bought the whole series in one swoop a month ago...	2000-12-23

And a vastly superior organism at that. All alone on this earth, and not understood by the human society, how can this organism have ethical and moral boundaries? Why would it not kill for a whim?<br />I've read this book with a growing sense of horror, as Sturgeon develops this concept further and further, shifting the perspective in each of the 3 parts, but always skillfully pulling the reader inside the protagonist, to make his point. Now I've finished it, some of my uncomfortable feelings are desolved because of the twist in the last paragraphs, but some still linger. A powerful book.	2000-12-18

After struggles, there are now laws against discrimination of sex, race and religion. In some places there already are laws against the discrimination of homosexuals, and before long there will be laws against the discrimination of age groups (especially elderly). You can be sure of that.<br />The Child Buyer is sketching the discrimination of people with extreem high IQ (HIQ's), something that isn't even an issue in real life (yet). Mediocracy rules the world.<br />The Child Buyer is a heart wrenching, but at times also hilarious, description of the trial in which must be decided if a HIQ young boy should be sold or not to a company, because that would be good for national security, even though the boy refuses to be merchandise. The book shows how the people of a small village abandon the boy in his lonely struggle, partly because they see him as uncomfortably different, partly because they think it's for his own good to be separated from the rest, and partly because it turns out to be in their own best financial interest if the cooperate...<br />Hersey has structured his book around the trial. It contains only the dialogue, that is recorded in the courtroom. This may seem odd in the beginning, and perhaps slowing things down a little when all the characters are introduced, but the author succeeds very well in showing the diffence in characters. And in exhibiting the gross stupidity of some of them, as well as the way people choose for there own wellfare, above anything else.<br />This book was way ahead of it's time, when it was published in 1960, and  - unfortunatly - it still is.<br />I can highly recommend it.	2000-12-16

And how these cloned descendends start their own type of society, in which individualism only exists in a few prosecuted deviates, people increasingly are breeded for special purposes and become more and more dispensable (there are always other copies left). The community cannot survive in the long run, because valuable human assets, such as the ability to have new ideas, and to reach out beyond what is teached, become extinct.<br />The thing that bothered me a bit, was that the decline of the society was based on the above described premisses, of the lack of original ideas, and intelligence after several cloned generations. This is not 'logically' or 'necessarily' anchored in the story. There seems to be no real reason for it, except that it happens, which imvho does not qualify as a reason. It feels like a plot device.<br />But, on the upside Wilhelm does a good job in dipicting the horrors of being a number, and the value of being an individual. The cloned society is believable, and engrossing. Wilhelm's writing style makes the book very accessible. Giving food for thought.	2000-12-16

A patient that seems to have much more influence on his environment than one would expect from someone who hasn't spoken or moved for nearly 50 years. Rositter describes the search for answers of the doctor, and how he tries to walk the very fine line between sanity and madness in discovering the disturbing thruth.<br />The book has well rounded characters. It's a good read, has tension and speed, and really gets to you.

How long would it take for their superhuman descendants to get even?<br />Herbert excells in what he does best: creating a complex situation, new and well worked out societies, layer upon layer to discover in high tension situations, a protagonist who starts as the unadjusted outsider, but ends up being the catalyst and more. Of course a comparison to Dune is easily made, but Herbert remains very creative and continues to surprise his readers. I won't go into the plotline here, but Herbert explores: the effects of high intelligence, a new view on justice and the justice system, unnatural selection, immortality and transcent intelligence. Enough to set the mind in motion.<br />Drawbacks are, in my opinion, the typical Herbert opening, introducing to many persons and plotlines for comfort, that will only be truly appreciated in a second reading. And the somewhat flat characters that are more vehicles to carry the plot, than that they are well rounded persons one can relate to and feel sorry for.	2000-12-06

Disch tries to tell us, by placing his protagonist in a situation where his IQ is enhanced artificially. But, IMHO Disch doesn't really succeed in showing what HIQ (= high IQ) feels like.<br />There are scores of books describing the differences between HIQ persons and normal people. Here come some of the characteristics Kevin Kearney sums up in the book &quot;Accidental Genius&quot;: having excessive amounts of energy, high sensitivity, extreme equity orientation, being bored easily, challenging authority, being extremely democratic oriented, being easily frustrated, extreme perfectionisme, they are intuitive and can predict what you're going to say before you say it. HIQ also has to do with being able to see connections easily, drawing conclusions from a few facts, clarity of thought.<br />Disch's geniuses show almost none of these charactersitics. They would have reacted very different on their situation, if they had. When Disch wants to show his geniuses's thought patterns the protagonists are being thrown into mental states, that can be best compared to being high on drugs or drunk. Partly because of that, but also when the protagionists are described in a more normal state, the book contains a lot of talking and thinking that I couldn't follow without an encyclopedia, since my knowledge of Renascence philosophy is not very impressive. Disch seems to use (f.i.) the discussions of Saint Thomas as a way to make the reader feel that these geniuses can comprehend difficult things. But that's my point. Being a genius has very little to do with knowledge. And beside that: I didn't pick this book in order to be informed on Renascence. I wanted to read about intelligence. <br />There are better ways to show what HIQ feels like from the inside, then using a wide beam of irrelevant, specialist, knowledge. Daniel Keyes for instance succeeds very well in showing the growth in clarity, the better deductions, the enhanced reasoning in his &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;<br />And even if Renascence philosphy would have been the best way to descibe geniality, then it would have been not only common courtesy to let the readers in on some of the basic principles, it would have also made it easier to comprehend how very excellent (perhaps) the thought patterns of the protagonists on this subject really were. Now, without this, all these philosophical side dishes made the book hard work, and not great fun to read, in my opinion.<br />So if you want to read a plausible story on what happens when someones IQ is enhanced suddenly, and what HIQ feels like, dont expect to much of this book.	2000-11-26

Even though it's been written in 1950, it still gets to me.<br />A young pilot, Carmody, crashes in the middle of China. He's rescued by a warlord (aka bandit), and forced to be his second in command. After some time the protagonist manages to escape discuised as a priest. When he arrives at a mission, where he had hoped to end the maskerade, the people address him as a priest from the very beginnning. Since he has started out acting as a cleryman, he cannot very well drop the pretence later on, and is forced to be Gods left hand. The story tells of the internal changes of the ex-bandit, ex-pilot working and living as a priest, rediscovering the believes of his childhood. And then the warlord arrives to reclaim his man ...<br />It's a wonderful composed story, with a high pace, tension, old fassioned adventure, but also introspection, humor, tenderness, and philosophy about the nature of man.	2000-11-22

In my experience it can be very well read without extensive prior philosophical knowledge. <br />Barrett places the rise of existentialism in it's time and in the context of world history, modernisation, individualism, the changes in religious feelings, and more. By going deep into the lives and work of Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Nietzsche and Sartre, Barrett shows 4 very different representatives of exisitentialism, thus giving the reader a wide perspective on the subject. Barrett is a master in presenting difficult abstract concepts in understandable language.<br />I've found the book both fascinating and inspiring. I can highly recommend it.	2000-11-22

Without revealing to much: the plot is driven by the occurence of planet in orbit of Earth. It's not as much about the alien interaction (and certainly not about an alien invasion) as it is about the devastating geological effects that the gravity pull of this planet has on Earth. An on it's people.<br />The book starts slowly, by introducing the 30-some protagonists (among them drunkards, scientists, UFO-believers, teenagers, would-be playwriters) all over Earth, living their very different things. But within 40 pages the action really gets to you. The value of having 30 correspondents with so varied a perspective around the world really adds to the experience. <br />The book is action packed, and shows considerable insight in the human behavior in times of disaster. Most of the character's situations and reactions are so real, that you cannot stop considering what you would have done yourself if these things had happened to you. <br />The importance of gravity to life on Earth becomes very clear to the reader. While reading the book you cannot escape marvelling about the wonderful, and fragile equilibrium that exists on this tiny planet. The book really gave me an acute feeling of cosmic scale, in which some minute change in the balance might trip the scale for us, and forever change everything we took for granted.<br />Paul Leiber well deserved the Hugo Saward in 1965 for this book. It hasn't aged much. It only shows that it's from that time, by the somewhat oldfasioned modes of discourse and interaction, between the sexes and the races. But that soon blends in, as the context of the book.<br />If there ever was a film scenario waiting to be found this is it. Especcially in our times, where the real spectacular views of this book can be generated by computer. Oh, I'ld love to see this on a large movie screen.	2000-11-19

And it is just that. &quot;And then....and then ... and then) It suffers greatly from the flatness of the (description of the) persons involved, the lack of emotional insight in Michael, the repetition in the actions (they fight a lot of the same fights with a different schools, they do a lot of brain stimulation at home), the lack of inspiration, and the fact that it describes only the first 11 years of this boy's life. Actually it's less a book about the boy, then it is about the parents. Beside that: it may look like a 200 page book. But since the space between the lines is twice as large as normal, it actually is just a 100 page book. <br />On the upside: especially Michael early years (0 to 3) are fun to read, because some of his progress is really incredible.

It has suspense, a good pace, new ideas in abundance, the opportunity for recognition, interesting new societies to explore, better rounded characters then Asmiov's usuals. It reads swiftly and entertains. For those of you who like puzzles: do try to figure out what Asimov was thinking when he numbered the chapters.But best of all: at last here is a novel dealing with the use and un-use of the brain.<br />&quot;Against stupidity the Gods themselves contend in vain.&quot; Asimov has devided the book in three parts<br />The first part of the book (titled: Against Stupidity) has chosen everyday stupidity as central theme. How people (human and otherwise) are interested more in immediate personal comfort then in learning the thruth. How people seem to avoid to think, if thinking might lead to discovering something unpleasant. And how this opens the possibilities for mismanagement, for praise (and careers) for the wrong people, and (hey, this is SF) for the destruction of our universe. This part can give a the feeling of deja vu and recognition to those working in hierarchical environnements, with it's usual not to bright, trouble avoiding, management. <br />The second part (titled: The Gods Themselves) deals with the bond between intelligence, childlike emotions, and parental instructions, that are also present in every human (see Freud (Es, Ego, Superego) or Harris (I'm OK, you're OK)). Asimov paints an interesting and novel alien universe in which these three parts of us are seperate types of characters, that marry in Triads, and how the unity between the 3 transcents them into something very different from the parts.<br />In the last part (Contend In Vain) the concept of advanced Intuition is explored as a means of knowing things, grasping solutions, without actually having a lot of knowledge on the subject. The setting for this is the utopic society living in colony on the moon. Some genetical enginering is implied, but not proven.<br />A book worth your time and money (which ever comes first)!	2000-11-17

I first spotted it some 20 years ago, but never actually got around to reading it. My hopes and expectations where high when I started reading it.<br />Partly I'm thrilled by the book. It containes some really amazing technical and sociological concepts. I cannot imagine how anybody can think that this book is based on just one concept: the ringworld itself. Sure, that's a magnificent imaginary leap into the unknown (and certainly was in 1970). But next to that there's this other subplot line, that turns out to be the mayor drive of the story: the actions and chances of a person breeded for luck. How that affects others and herself. And the magnitude of the idea that a cowardice alien race out of fear &quot;improves&quot; at least two whole races (two whole planets) genetically to better fit in their own plans. And how this wonderfully backfires on them. But also on the others. And then there are the nice technical gadgets in this book, ways of transportations, methods to immortallity, ways to build houses, cities and starships (yeah, yeah, and worlds). Enough to fancy hardcore SF-readers.<br />Partly I was disappointed by the book. I felt it's speed dropped considerably when they landed on the ringworld, and the book switched from SF to (almost) fantasy, with it's all to normal quest-structure. It stopped thrilling me then, though I kept with it, still interested. In part the lack of character depth and development was showing more profoundly in this quest. I didn't mind the sexual parts of the book. They are not arrousing (at least not in the 21th century). I see them as just a normal part in SF from this period (end 1960's, begin 70's. See f.i. Logan's run). <br />I see the critical notes about character depth, sex and the (in 2000) all to often used queste structures as anachronistical. But still, instead of the 5 star feeling I had about the book, before I ever opened it, I must give it 4 stars,reading it in this day and age. It's a classic SF-book. And that shows in both possitive and negative ways. <br />But read it anyway!! It's still very much alive. And you'll find out afterwards that a lot of present day writers use Nivens ideas as if they where their own. These ideas have been So influentual that they are now incorporated in SF as a genre.	2000-11-12

And (in the end) that's what I've got: the discovery of an ancient society, a race that lived before the first race known to man so far.<br />Unfortunately it's not all new there. The society closely resembles Aztec culture with it's sacrificial slaughter, although the motives of the Kh!lict are xenofobic, and not religious.   More interesting is that the Kh!lict have a non-vocal communication in which colors are important; that the crab-like creatures evolve from male to female during their lives; that they live in a matriarchal society; and that the body of knowledge that this society wants their members to have, is imprinted in its adolecents during a rite of passage. <br />The Kh!lict society is long gone, but is discovered from the inside out, nevertheless. A strange divice turns several crew members into Kh!lict (yes: into crabs). Honestly, it took me some time to adjust to this plot device. But I must admit: it was one of the best ways of archeological exploration I've seen so far. I got used to it after a while.<br />So: my end conclusion is that I have mixed feelings about this book. If you like archeology, philosophy, sociology or antropology you'll like it. If you expect starships to boldly go - etcetera, this one's probably not for you.	2000-11-07

I say this because in this books, next to the normal first contact episodes, the ever present klingon warriors, the torpedo's, the bantering between the 3 leading characters, in this book two interesting alien societies are sketched. Esspecially the strongly individualistic culture of geneticly manipulated humans, that have adopted themselfs to their tasks, their waterful environnement and their own wishes is fascinating.	2000-11-01

I was also bored by plotdivises as the hidden political agenda's and well kept secrets, that are used to send the Enterprise on it's mission. That's not what Star Trek is about (IMVHO)<br />But then, on page 95, the book starts again (or at last) with a surprise and a bang. All at once there is a real antagonist, a real plotline, with tension of it's own, and a danger to avert not only for the Enterprise, but for Starfleet as a whole. And the dignitary turns out to be not half as bad, as she had seemed all these pages. <br />So: this is not the best of books. Do not recomment it to non-Trekkies, 'cause - after reading this - they'll never believe Star trek is fun. But if you have patience and perseverance, than there's a good chance you'll at least enjoy the second half of the book.	2000-10-22

It has a definite tension, mixed with suspense. And it also features a extraordinary landing party, in which Spock and McKoy are the senior officers, while Kirk remains on board the Enterprise, dealing with his own set of trouble. The interaction between the three of them is engaging as ever.<br />The landing party boards a deserted gigantic Romulan space station, that is adrift in Federation space. Well, deserted... There are thousands of Romulans on board, but they appear to be in a definite state of decay. What happened to them? And is that happening to the landing party as well? How come that even Kirk and the Enterprise seems affected?<br />A good read.	2000-10-22

It's foreword already tells us that the focus will be  on Winstons character, with his career only as background.<br />If you keep  that in mind, and don't expect details on his campaigns, government and  financial policy, this is an interesting biography, that depicts Chutchill  as a larger than life, somewhat unbalanced and egocentric bully, with some  ideologies that on a closer look are a dubious mixture of conservatism and  fascism. A man that fortunatly lived in the right time, when there was  active need for such a man, to combat Hitler.<br />The reason I only gave 3  stars for this book, is that I firmly believe that any biography should  have footnotes and references to liturature, so that you can check some of  the wrirters assumptions, esspecially if the focus is not on facts but on  character, as is the case here and that this is completely missing here.	2000-08-11

I liked the quick wit,  the humorous exchanges between the characters,and the plot. I had really  been waiting for this new Bel/Mal book to happen.<br />But &quot;Polgara&quot;  left me disappointed, retelling that already twice told long story of what  Pol and Belgareth did during 3000 years when noting much of a plot happend,  before the actual series (Bel /Mal) started. Just adding the angle of  Polgara's perception is definately not enough to salt this  journal-of-a-time-of-waiting. It has little entertaining value, and a  shrill lack of tension. If the Eddingses wanted to show that this is simply  what longevity is like, well, than the succeeded. But I think it's a real  pitty, because there is so much more that can be done with the good set of  characters the they created in the Bel/Mal. I do hope they start a NEW  plot/series with them.	2000-08-11

It seems to say that the treasures of heretic pharao Echnaton are  buried in a secret chamber underneath the sphinx. A second part of the  papyrus (on which to location is revealed) is stolen, and clues are that  Oldrik (the old time antagonist of Blake and Mortimer) is involved somehow.  And could there perhaps still be followers of Echnatons religion after all  these millenia, protecting the tomb with ancient magic.....?<br />It's a  fairly high paced adventure with some magnificent drawings of Egyptian art,  dark passageways in tombs and Gizeh, but also with a good share of  information on Echanton and his significance. For me this book was the  beginning of a life long fascination with ancient Egypt and archeology. I  still hope to buy a poster with drawings of the book.<br />Luckely this is  only part one, of a two-parter! So there is more to look foreward to.	2000-07-21

In  a tense nightly exploration of tombs on the plateau of Gizeh Blake and  Mortimer discover the truth of the chamber of Horus and the treasure of  Echnaton.

I read this one for the first time as a young adult, and I have kept rereading it every say 3 years or so afterwards. I still can remember the  day and the special joy when I actually could buy my own copy of this  book.<br />Tonke Dragt mixes science fiction with psychology and a poetic  world desciption, as she matches extra terrestrials with telepathy. She  creates a wonderful atmosphere that way, that pulls you into the book, and  only releases you after the last page has been read, sad that the book has  ended already.<br />The protagonist is an planet explorer. An exception to the  rule, since he is one of the very few people who asked for a reassignment  on Venus. Everyone else is glad to get away of the planet with its jungles,  that seem to destroy everything man brings in there. With microbes that is,  not by flesh eating plants or things like that. Very little is known about  these forests. People do not venture there anymore. Those who did, lost  their minds, or never came back. It seems a very hostile place for mankind.  It seems uninhabited too... When people ask Edu why he wanted to come back  he encourages them to think it's for his promotional chances, but the truth  is, the jungle draws him, seems to call him....<br />I won't spoil it all, and  disclose more. The book has high pace, high tension but also a good grasp  of what moves people and what they are afraid of. <br />If you can lay your  hands on it: read it!	2000-07-20

I do not doubt that Hoover used illegal  means for his person goals, but I would much rather have read a book that  gives me the feeling I should take it seriously, because it shows on every  page and footnote it takes itself and its investigation serious. This  unbalanced account of his life has flipped over to one side, proclaiming  Hoover the bad guy, without exploring even the possiblilty of a positive  side of the man. It's as if the writer settles a scoure here. It left me  with the uneasy feeling I do not know WHAT to believe and what to  discard.<br />If you like a good scandal, this is your book. If you want  historical facts, look elsewhere	2000-07-19

It's unbalanced, emotional, somewhat chaotic, and  very little to the point. I almost stopped reading the book because of  this.<br />But when you start reading where the chronological description of  the pope's life starts, you'll find a thorough biography, without  exaltation, and not without some critical points of view.  The first half  of the book deals with the years before Karol became pope, and show how he  was trained, coached, and grew as a actor, priest, play write, bishop,  mystic poet and cardinal, in the often hard conditions in Poland. The  second half deals with his policies as pope. Here is also a special focus  on the Polish situation and how the pope exercised influence there. The  book helps understanding the motivations of John Paul, even though one  doesn't have to agree with him on all accounts.<br />An interesting,  insightful book.	2000-07-16

Gorbachev: An Intimate Biography (Signet Books)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	shallow biography, published during Gorbachev's 'reign'	The most interesting feature of this book, is that is was published in 1988, when Gorbachev was still in power, and Yeltsin only the man who had just been removed out of his office by Gorbachev. It's a wonderful frozen  piece of time.<br />On the whole this book has all the characteristics of a  pre-glasnost biography, and as such it is far from &quot;intimate&quot;,  even though the subtitle claims to be just that. There are gaps in the  chronology, and especially in the depth of the life description. And  because of that, the book lacks tension and fascination, that an intimate  biography of the head of state of a complex, and foreign, Russian society  could have. Gorbachev is depicted as a fairly decent man, who becomes  secretary general because of his qualities and the some what ill defined   possibility of a power game. At one points there is the suggestion that  perhaps to get into the top job Gorbachev had to do some less than  commendable things, but that remains vague, and second guessing, much as  the rest of the book, unfortunately.	2000-07-16

Try to summarize the book, guys, and you'll see it's an in-between-events type of book. A corridor. Sure, it reveals some possible secret or subversive group in Starfleet, but  basically mr Shatner is refuelling here, bringing up new motivations for  the two Kirks to combat eachother again, in what resembles an ego trip to  much for comfort.<br />I feel embaressment for the unsubtle way the  Kirk-centeredness in this book is not hidden. Janeway has a non speaking  role in the background, Picard is an inferior officer in both universes,  and the two Spocks are dragged around for no real purpuse other than for  background coloring. The whole universe - no, even two universes - revolve  around two Shatners. <br />This series was fun when we were surprised by the  crossover visits of our other beloved characters. It gave the story extra  dramactic and emotional impact. But now they are sort of abused as ideal  extra's. Ideal, because since we all know who they are, they don't require  shaping and descripion and development. I'm really disappointed in this  book.<br />Beside all that, a fair warning: if you haven't read the book that  came right before this one, you'll miss the clue of the first part  entirely. So don't start here.	2000-07-13

The  few people who resist that, join (out of faith) the Catholic order of  Leibowitz, and try to preserve every scrap of paper from before the  Simplification, even though context is missing, and most of the time they  do not have a clue as to what they are copying through the ages. There is a  nice little subtheme concerning an electronic wiring schema that is  transmutated into a wonderous religious icon.<br />Also impressive is the fine  character exploration, with moving and humorous aspects, and details that  help better understand the predicament and the superstitions of the  literate but otherwise (in our present sense of the word) uneducated monks  in a grim world that has been destructed centuries ago, and will not be  restored anytime soon.<br />Matching this world, it is not a fast paced book.  But because of the well developed world, atmosphere and characters it works  itself into your system inevitably. It changes the way you perceive your  everyday life. And if you have any beliefs in the 'Progress of the World'  or 'Growth of Mankind' this book will subtely alter that,  persuading you  gently to rethink the possibilities.<br />After all these years this book is  very much alive, and it definitely will remain so for the decades to come.  It is a treat, don't miss it.	2000-06-17

Whenever I start with a book of his, I brace myself for yet another alterego surrounded by beautiful educated females who adore him for unknown reasons, and the also inevitable stronger  helper/superhuman who accompanies and teaches the protagonist.<br />This time  there was a &quot;line marriage&quot;, again giving the protagonist any  number of women he would want, and thus the opportunity to be lofty about  it. But I admit readily: the line marriage is a real good idea. I hope it  will be allowed on earth real soon.  And yes the superbrain was there in  the story too. This time in the form of a sentient supercomputer that was  interesting to meet, and gave the opportunity to explore Heinleins concepts  of AI. <br />The most important reason I liked this book is because it matched  an intelligent plot to fast paced action and considerable insights in the  making of revolutions and the behavior of governments if they are  confronted with one.  If you're planning a revolution, do read this book as  a starter. But if you're not: it's still a good read that as an extra  resets your thoughts about the way we have structured our society now.	2000-06-10

All sound and solid sf themes. What makes the book enchanting is the music to which these notes  are set, the way the protagonist sees the world, the way the people in the  direct environnement of the way station are being described. Here are also  themes, better known in fantasy literature, like the magic in the  &quot;Talisman&quot;, the savior lost and found, the faul smelling thief,  the alien friend. Simak's writing style that seems so clear, is very  capable of luring the readers into his plot.<br />Not 5 stars because things  come together a bit to neatly at the end and to quickly.

It deals with the concept of time travel, the theme of the orphaned hero in a strange land, and prehistorical exploration in the best Auel tradition. A very good  read indeed.<br />And then, just about half way through, the book suddenly  dies (p.188 in my edition). Sure, there still is some plot development, but  the fast paced tension that kept me tied to the book the first half, is  gone, replaced by semi-deep thoughts and not really interesting feelings of  the protagonist. I kept on reading, hoping it would be a temporary dip.  <br />It wasn't.<br />I feel cheated out of what should and could have been a  better book.	2000-06-09

Their society, their planet, and technology are all new and very  interesting to read about. As are the hillarious and deeply frightening  adventures of the sole dragon that is to visit the earth. He, the  dislocated orphan, functions knowingly and willingly as a catalisator for  the previously burried feelings of discontent in the people who feel they  don't fit in society.

Goodkinds book raises a sharp tension in the reader, because he writes on, where normal books stop, and fantasy writers avert their eyes and pens. I felt true horror reading this book. It's best classified as a mixture of  pulp SM and pulp fantasy.<br />Why pulp fantasy, you might ask? --- because of  the cliches. There hardly is a new thought in it (well, besides from very  smart idea to penetrate the fantasy book market with concepts as the  sm-like enslaving proces, bondage, skin ripping, and brain raping). But  next to that, the structure of the book is like a lego-building of which  you can easily distinguish the building blocks: a bit of a quest here, a  witch in the woods there, the semi ophan who turns out to be ..., etc. It  would be nice to do some research to see if really every cliche is covered  here. The fact that Goodkind needs a new geographic scenery for each new  encounter gives his jig saw of cliches away easily.<br />I can't really get  into why it's pulp SM, because in my opinion SM books classify as pulp by  definition. But I'll admit readily: i'm not well versed in it.<br />If  violence turns you on: by al means, read this series. It gives you what no  other fantasy series will. And all in a far better disguise then the  &quot;real&quot; SM books with their reveiling titles and covers. Why, you  can even read it in the train to work.	2000-05-15

Their society, their planet, and technology are all new and very  interesting to read about. As are the hillarious and deeply frightening  adventures of the sole dragon that is to visit the earth. He, the  dislocated orphan, functions knowingly and willingly as a catalisator for  the previously burried feelings of discontent in the people who feel they  don't fit in society. Blish strikes a nerve there that hasn't changed much  since the book received the Hugo Award in 1959. <br />Perhaps the Devil had a  hand in it after all.	2000-05-12

What if gender did not exist? If everybody was genderless in most of the time, but male or female once a month, never sure which sex it's gonna be, since it depends on the  sex of the partner. How would it change character, politics,  friendship?<br />Le Guin has an excellent writing style that begs to be read  out loud. She has also created a couple of interesting natives for the  protagonist to deal with, and a well developed plot (yes, folks, there is a  plot, don't believe those who couldn't find any) in which the premisse gets  a chance to be exposed. <br />But the whole would have been more effective and  provocative if she would have stopped calling every hermaphrodite  &quot;he&quot;, &quot;son&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, etc. Now, as it is, in  the tension of the plot with all the he-ing you sometimes forget about the  ambivalence of the natives. And what whould have added to the tension  between the genderless natives and the male visitor, would have been when  the man would have behaved a bit (more) manly. <br />Then why 5 stars? ----  It's a good read. That's the first a book has to be. It sets your mind and  soul in motion too, and there is a wonderful underlying serene, thoughtfull  atmosphere throughout the book. But most of all - I was moved. That doesn't  happen often. The book hasn't suffered from the time that's past since it  received the Nebula ('69) and the Hugo Award ('70), and it will survive the  next decades without any doubt.	2000-05-12

No heaven (or hell, for that matter) no reincarnation. Just nothing. Until someone develops the technology,  and the will, to bring  back everyone who has ever died on this planet. Bring them back with no  possesions, no tools, no clothes, no infrastructure, and not a clue. Just  billions and billions of naked confused, semi-immortal, multi-cultural  human beings. What will they do? What is the meaning of all this?<br />The  actions these resurrected peoples take are very well written and highly  believable (unfortunately). The motives of the people who are responsible  for all this are the mystery we are trying to solve.<br />Farmer received the  1972 Hugo Award for this book that did survive the test of time, and is  still a good read now.  Then why not 5 stars? --- This book is not a well  rounded whole, with a plot that comes to a resounding conclusion. At 3  quaters of the book the pace changes, slowes down. The answer is pushed  further to the future, and it soon becomes clear a further quest will be  nessessary, even though the book ends. I suppose you'll (and I'll) have to  read the rest of what now turns out to be a series to reach the  fullfillment of a filosofical conclusion. That's why I feel a bit cheated.	2000-05-11

Sometimes I went inside to review some tapes that I was reminded  of by the book. <br />If your not very familiar with Star Trek this book is  not the best way to begin. Some of the quotes are spiced by the scenes they  were in. They loose flavour taken out of context, especially if you're not  familiar with the context at all.

This is a book dating back at the beginning of the series. Bashir is still the eager inexperienced young man, who wants to practice &quot;true  frontier medicine&quot;, Kira's still the though, nearly out of control ex,  but not really ex, guerilla.<br />The characterisation is not flawed in this  book. But the characters have evolved so much in the 7 years that it's  almost incredable to read about the beginning.<br />And because almost half of  the book deals with the psychological processes of these two and between  these two, it's not among the best of ST DS9 books I've read (That's Fallen  Heroes,, of course).<br />Besides this, the second plot line deals with a nest  of horta babies crawling through the station, being unresponsive to  communication or to faser fire. Of course the crisis rises as they crawl  on, distroying this or that vital part of the station. Boredom rises as  well, for nothing really happens besides more destruction and more  desparation. <br />Definately not among the best.	2000-05-08

Mission had me hooked up, right from the start. <br />What would you do if he (aka He) dropped by, fueling your doubts in the  old story, providing you with a new one?. Or if you were a docter in  intensive care, when a patient is brought in with these remarkable, even  typical, wounds? <br />There is a sense of wonder in this book, that's firmly  based in our ancient Lore and recent archeology. I'm sceptic at best when  it comes to religion, but a very interested sceptic. This book set my  thoughts in motion and shifted my views. Somewhat.<br />Besides from all that,  it's a very well written book, with well filled out characters, a good  plotline, attention to details, tension and thought intermingled  handsomely, and oh, such a nice sting in the tail.<br />It's too bad that  there are so little people who have read the book, and that there are so  few new copies available to give away to my friends.<br />Please reprint this  book!

I had hoped for a brain thrilling breakthrough, new perceptions on exceptional thinking processes. Unfortunately the protagonists simply jumps to his seammingly farfetched  (aka non Artistotelian?) conclusions askes a leap of faith for the readers.  I'd much rather have learned more about how to change for A to null-A  thinking.<br />Of course it is a book best seen in the time it was written  (copyright 1945). The structure, with it's chaotic start, that puzzles the  reader for the first couple of chapters, is something not commenly found  after the 50's. <br />And yes, it is a sf classic, but no, it's not a good  read that I can recommend.	2000-05-06

Fountains of Paradise is no exception to that. In the midsection of the  book the alien computers observations on man's religions had me baffled,  laughing out loud (having just studied Thomas Aquinas, and Ockham) and  pondering.<br />Unfortunatedly the book is unballanced. It starts as an  historical antropological novel. The midsection deals with alien visitors  and filosofical conceptions, the end has the plot of an action movie,  featuring a disaster and rescue mission. On the whole not a pleasant read.  But the reactions of the alien computer made it more then worth while.	2000-05-05

It represents the inner court yard of Pontius Pilatus' palace. Pilatus has just washed his hands. There are Roman soldiers, a croud of agitated jews, and ofcourse a  battered Jesus. <br />At first glance people admire the painting as a  technical masterpiece. But very soon, scanning details of the picture,  every spectator sees his own face somewhere in the painting. Perhaps a jew  throwing rocks at Jesus, perhaps a stoic soldier. Some people run away,  ashamed before the others (not knowing everybody only sees himself), some  people look inward for the truth of things. And the young painter goes on a  quest in order to find out who has painted this remarkeble painting.<br />Not  5 stars, because the painting gradually becomes secundairy on the quest,  which is not my favorite plot twist.	2000-03-29

That's also dull because of the predictability of it all. We  already know how it started, and writer doesn't add something that would  change that.  The description of the earlier stages of Vulcan history  luckily has protagosts in it, but shows a yawning resemblance of &quot;The  clan of the Cave Bear&quot;, the first chapter of &quot;2001 Space  Odyssey&quot;, or any one of the many prehistoric novels that have been so  popular not so long ago. No news there, no reason to read.<br />But what makes  the book worth buying are 1. the story of Surak; 2. the speach of McKoy; 3.  the story of Sarek.  These are very well told, intelligent and moving  parts. Very good. And it was interesting to learn more about Surak and his  filosophy, to learn more about the Vulcan way, and the deeper motivations  of Sarek and how he came to marry Amanda. Thus uncovering parts of the Star  Trek universe that have been there (implicitely) from the very beginning,  but never where explored this way before. Fans will appreciate these  chapters very much. But I should warn you: these events all take place  after page 283 and, for your information: it's a 388 page book.<br />Really to  bad that this book is such an untuned mixture of beauty and boredom.	1999-07-13

Would we be who we are when we had grown up, using a language with no word for me or I or, for that matter, you? Would we be able to think better or faster  when we used another language for our thoughts? Is that a way to define  intelligence? Can language be used to manipulate so sharply that it becoms  a weapon?<br />A must-read SF classic, not only because of the theme, but also  because of the vivid new (1966!) universe he created, and the way he sees  our future. Delaney avoids the trap of (some) older SF-writers: to focus on  the theme instead of the plot. It's an excellent read. <br />Babel-17 won the  Nebula Award in 1966.	1999-07-01

If it was possible to give 7 stars I would do so for this book. <br />Though I wouldn't have thought so during the first couple of chapters. The book starts slowly, like many of the SF out of that period does: it leaves the  reader a bit disoriented (modern readers are more used to books starting at  the peak of an action) But it's a miracle of fresh and mind provoking ideas  on what it is to be human. Mostly on the relationship between religion,  sexuality, domination and destruction. No: don't think now, because of what  I just typed, that you can now predict what Sturgeon will show you. His  views are not common property even 40 years after the book was first  published. I can imagine it must have been a shocker in 1960!<br />It's a  highly quotable book, that alteres your perception of the world and the  &quot;logic&quot; of how we are behaving.

I was taken by surprise when on the first page of this book, Kathryn Janeway managed to swing her command chair around. If the author had ever seen a Star Trek Voyager episode, she might have noticed that Janeway's  chair is attached to Chakotay's, with a small \\"computer table\\"  (also attached) in the middle. So, if Janeway against all odds, had managed  to swing the chair around, Chakotay would have been swung over Tom Paris's  head until he bounced back against the viewscreen. Not a bright  start.<br />The storyline in the book was tolerable. But the Voyager crew was  not necessary for it to unroll. They could have easily been replaced by some local heroes. The crew's characters weren't explored very deeply eighter.  <br />All in all these three things give the impression that the writer has rewriten an old story to fit as a Voyager book, on the basis of some brief character descriptions.<br />Three stars nevertheless, because with all this  said, it wasn't too bad a plot, and a nicely written story.	1999-05-20

The action has high speed, and interesting plot twists.<br />BUT: I cannot understand how Paramount possibly could have  allowed anyone (even Shatner) to destroy the heart of Borg in a paperback  book.<br />There has to be some consistency in the Star Trek Universe. The  books, the series and the films. Which means that this destruction  &quot;actually&quot; happend in the Star Trek universe. It can not be  undone.  The Borg are reduced to a weakend species, that now can be  overcome by Starfleet anytime they feel like it.<br />All of the other books,  films etc have to take these ideas of Shatner as facts now that they are  published.<br />And then: with transwarp drive stolen from the Borg and  installed in a Starfleet ship. And with the 100 year travel to the Delta  Quadrant Borg HQ therby reduced to just 7 hours (in an 1996 book), how can  Starfleet possibly let Janeway out there desperatly on her own? They can  rescue her with no more effort than a weekend picnic in Iowa!!!<br />That are  just two of the examples of how Shartner effected the logics and the future  of our Star Trek universe. Our universe. Not his. By the way he carelessly  tosses it around, I cannot escape the idea that he wouldn't mind at all, if  it collapsed after his departure.<br />So: yes I like the book, the exiting  pace of it, and especially the crossovers from the 3 series. But I cannot  be content with the distruction of the inner logic of the Star Trek  universe. Someone has to hold Shatner on a tight leash to prevent further  harm.	1999-02-28

It's not to bad a read, but it couldn't really tease me into te story. And what I minded next to that, is that it's far to obvious what the aliens on board  are doing to Chakotay and Paris, but the authors keep on  &quot;exploring&quot; that issue time after time. Beside that I can also  not appreciate the quick-fixes they use. For instance how the transporter  gets on line just in time to save everybody's life, in situations that  would otherwise have been unresolvable, or the fact that the shields were  fixed just in time to save everything when there was no other hope.  It's  just to easy. And then there is the role Kes plays in this novel: in a  considerable amount of the book her dialogue resticts itself to statements  that &quot;people please should listen to Neelix&quot;...!<br />So why isn't  the book only a 1 star novel? Because the aliens on the planet are  worthwhile; because the idea of the effects of having 3 moons are  interesting, as is Torres' idea on solving the problems; because the  Janeway-Tuvok-Kim-interactions are done well.	1998-11-11

But the pages in between, are a description of how Voyagers crew  stumble around in the dark of a complex society which needs more than these  couple of pages to be explained in. It's as if the author tried to make a  civalization as politically interesting as Herbert's Dune, but with to  little space to give it body, and of course with primary (Voyager)  characters that have nothing to do with the society (but stumble around,  trying several different non helpfull ways to deal with these politics  which they don't understand either) If you haven't read all the other  Voyager books, please read those others first.

I remember looking up from my book every half hour or so, and telling myself to keep on reading, not to give up on Voyager.  On the whole I found it &quot;flat&quot;. Flat in characterisation and shallow in plotline. There can be much more made of this book when you really start working on it's possibilities on the exploration of planets, cultural changes during millenia, religious depth and goasts, being evil usurpors, slavery, wormholes, loyalty versus madeness. The story touches all these wonderful elements, but never gets to explore them in a better way then is done in a childrens book: easy and shallow....And then there are those major plot-damaging inconsistencies. One of the major points is that the &quot;slave race&quot; never has seen the face of their usurpors. But on the other hand they have their technology copied, because one of the evil ships crashed on the planets surface.... What was nice was the crossreverence to the series, to things happened in the Voyagers past. It really was our crew that way.<br />But what I really hated was her getting into Janeways head, making her a bit of an neurotic women, with a rather typical set of values and attitudes for instance on bravery and keeping up appearences. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to quote passages (copywrite and such things) so I'd better not, sorry. <br />On the whole I think this book was an easy ride for the aut! hor. It has all the characteristics of a having-to-pay-the-rent-quickie. And yes: we fans we are known to be loyal buyers of spin-off of our series, so we even &quot;buy&quot; these things (in both senses of the word).

And what could be more moving and gripping, then a very private report of the dying process of a young woman, Katherine, who doesn't know that she's been filmed, by Rod &quot;the man with the eyes&quot;. Who, with the oldest trics and the newest equipment, does everything to get the best shots. But, then, some things turn out to be not exactly what they seemed to be. And surely everything is not what they had hoped for. An intelligently written book that shows us what our society can become within the next 5 to 10 years. Compton has an eye for details, for drama and for the human interchanges. A masterpiece!	1998-01-24

I've enjoyed the Belgariad and Malloreon very much and read the books several times. I liked the quick wit, the humorous exchanges between the characters, and the plot. But &quot;Polgara&quot; left me disappointed, rewriting that already twice told long story of what Pol and Belgareth did during 3000 years when noting much of a plot happend, before the actual series (Bel/Mal) started. Just adding the angle of Polgara's perception is definately not enough to salt this journal-of-a-time-of-waiting. It has little entertaining value, and a somewhat shrill lack of those peculiar grins that swept my face reading the Bel/Mal.     There is so much more that can be done with the good set of characters the Eddingses created in the Bel/Mal. I do hope they start a NEW plot/series with them.	1997-07-24
