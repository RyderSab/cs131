It's not a primer on attacking chess, it  doesn't develop an &quot;attacking theory,&quot; it just gives you  isolated, random examples of attacks (usually against the king) and  frankly, you probably have alot of good examples already in your own books.	2000-06-01

Clear Explanations On Chess Thought Inside	A brilliant little book that is clearly written, extremely useful, and bargain-priced. Do not be misled by the author's use of maxims for chapter titles: he is not dogmatic whatsoever. Znosko-Borovsky's verbal analysis of  a chess position, for example, on pages 54-60, regarding visualizing a plan  based on the differences (however slight)in each side, and putting that  plan into effect is an eye-opener. If you've read Jeremy Silman's How To  Reassess Your Chess, you'll recognize the thinking method detailed decades  before Silman published. I believe you will not regret time spent with this  book.	2000-05-25

Material ranges from the  classic Lucena/Philidor positions, to much more complex practical rook  endings. I think The Survival Guide can be profitably used both by novices  for a concise introduction to rook endings and stronger players (including  masters) as a comprehensive review and reinforcement. I also feel that GM  Emms presents the material in an interesting, informative and  well-organized manner, and maintains his emphasis on practical rook  endings. Agreeing that there are other rook endings books, I still believe  that you are much more likely to read, enjoy and finish The Survival Guide  than most other books.	2000-05-21

Somehow, we'd all be  more intelligent, critical thinkers, if we invented our own operating  systems. Why stop there? Why not build our own computers? And I don't mean  buying off-the-shelf parts, but actually getting our own silicon, wiring,  etc. This book really is for techies, and not for those who regard  computers as a means to an end, not an end in itself. Although the author  tries to create a larger context (&quot;we should make our own  decisions&quot;), his own history of screwing around trying to set a system  up is pathetic. I'd rather be hiking, surfing, or riding, than waste more  time trying to reinvent the wheel.	2000-05-16

Having  more &quot;white space&quot; does not make MC0-14 a less serious work -  just one with different priorities. The GMs who co-wrote MC0-14 did a  thorough job - AND included words! I find it a valuable middlegame guide  when MCO-14 evaluates a variation with text (&quot;White is slightly better  due to the two bishops and active pieces&quot;) rather than simply NCO's  brief +/=. Masters and above need no verbal evaluations, the rest of us  (I'm only rated 1820 U.S.C.F. myself) need more help in the clinches.	2000-05-16

I tell you I always thought Southies were born violent  and avoided them when possible and knocked them on their asses when not.

Corum changes from a  somewhat privileged member of a decadent, spiritual race into a  battle-hardened tough survivor capable of defeating gods and arguing  against &quot;fate.&quot; Moorcock tells an old-fashioned tale very well.

The Others are a peaceful, technologically-advanced, spiritual species, reminiscent of Vulcans (except without the hint of repressed emotion). They  live lives of quiet contemplation and inner growth. The People are a  warlike, unsophisticated, primitive race with a culture and technological  level similar to Earth's European feudal period. Eventually, after an  initial period of hero-worship by the People of The Others, the barbaric  impulse to genocide causes the People to turn the technological gifts of  The Others against them. Any interesting tale that reminded me of Michael  Moorcock's &quot;Chronicles of Corum&quot; in which savage humans (Mabden)  destroy a decadent, advanced race out of jealosy. I think also that there  is a strong Star Trek influence in the portrayal of The Others (i.e. the  Vulcans) and in the situation (remember the original series episode where  &quot;Nazis&quot; are warring against their racial &quot;inferiors&quot;  who were at one time their benefactors.) It was irritating to me to have  the author create a race that seemed to have NO concept of self-defence  even when their children and their entire existence is threatened but that  may be a sign of how real this imaginary world was. Worth-looking for.  Imagine, I found my hardback copy at a Rehab Hospital so something good  came out of my accident!	2000-04-14

It firmly maintains that every chessplayer, whether amateur or master, is capable of creating something  new in chess. After a discussion of the characteristics and processes of  creativity, 10 central concepts, such as unusual positioning and  functioning of pieces, alertness to subtle differences, absurd moves,  flexibility, etc., are presented with a wealth of truly amazing examples to  encourage the reader to broaden the horizons of his chess thinking. Whether  or not the author's approach will improve your chess (I think it will), it  is definitely a change of pace from your standard middlegame or opening  text.	2000-04-07

He notes how most players often go from desperate  suicidal attempts at counterplay or play passively, defending threats and  drifting towards defeat. What Mednis provides is info on how one can  balance one's play and make the opponent earn that victory. His examples  are memorable - for instance, players are often reluctant to trade queens  fearing it will blunt their attack, but often the opposing queen is a great  defender without which the enemy's position often collapses. An interesting  and rewarding read.	2000-04-06

In one test, you may be given the following alternatives: a) Should you try to close the center and attack on the kingside? b)Double the  enemy's pawns and pile up on the open file? c)Or take the initiative and  prepare a central pawn advance? You're not thrown into the tests without  preparation as the authors first discuss (with 7 detailed games) ways to  analyze, asess, and implement a plan. I would say that this book is a  positional brother to all those chess tactics books. If you can find it,  well worth buying.	2000-04-02

The author is an International  Master and a journalist, so his knowledge is deep and articulately  presented. The recommended main line for White is positional (4 Nf3 5 Be2 6  0-0) however move alternatives are explored in many different chapters. For  me, the only drawback was my reluctance to study in-depth a variation I  rarely get the chance to play since I prefer queen's pawn openings!	2000-04-01

It's very strong in presenting to the intermediate player numerous interesting and useful strategic examples: attack against the castled king, nurture your space  advantage, opposite side castling, attack the base of a pawn chain, etc.  The author generally uses a mix of new and classic examples. I've found the  large number (101) of examples perfect for training purposes on my computer  wherein I play the game positions trying to employ the book strategies. The  weakness of the book is in the relatively superficial treatment of the  strategies, no clear linkage between strategies, and sometimes unclear  writing. I've enjoyed this book although I wouldn't say it was  &quot;essential&quot; as you can generally find in your own books examples  to practice using. Still, 101 mini-lessons collected in one volume? Worth  buying.	2000-03-31

The level of analysis is suitable for most  ambitious non-masters familiar with opening theory. The book is  well-organized, easy-to-use (finding variations is simple), although my  copy could have been printed with darker ink(!) and more complete game  examples. As a player who uses 1 e4 a great deal, I needed a simple,  competitive answer to 1...c5 that gave White the choice of systems. I've  used 2 Nc3 (Closed Sicilian) but found it tame. 3 Bb5 is an active, sound  system, easily learned, fun to play. Consider it.	2000-03-30

Howell explains clearly and thoughtfully king &amp; pawn  endgames, rook &amp; pawn endgames, minor piece endings, queen endings,  pawnless endings, etc. He insists you think for yourself but he does  provide general principles to guide one's calculations. I read the book as  1800 USCF player and found it to be both useful and interesting. Yes,  interesting!

I bet if you asked 100 Grandmasters and authors, 98 would've heard of Fine. In this book, Fine emphasizes developing in the player the  ability to analyze a position and to proceed accordingly. There are  sections on mating attacks; combination play; how to handle superior  positions, even positions; continuations of the openings; and transition to  the end game. Maybe many of us think that the old books are outdated and  stodgily written. Not so with Fine.

Often regarded as unsound at the grandmaster level, the King's Gambit is still a powerful  attacking weapon for the other 99.9% of us. The authors have updated their  earlier work with new analysis, sample games and tutorial questions.  The  text covers (in clear prose,well organized variations,readable fonts) all  major lines including the Kieseritzky, Philidor, Hanstein, and Muzio lines.  Although it is often said that said that the age of swashbuckling chess is  over (its hard to swash when they won't buckle), and maybe it is at the  higher levels, the rest of us still can learn the art of attack.	2000-03-24

How can an older book be of use to someone looking to play this sharp opening? Well, Taulbut's approach focused on the basic  (fixed)principles of each line and allowed the reader to choose the  specific variation that suited him. So, where other books are heavy on  variations and thin on ideas, Taulbut stresses thematic plans that should  be adopted by both sides, as well as examining how typical pawn structures  and their significance for endgame play. In 15 chapters, the author covers  variations such as The Closed Morphy Defence, The Marshall Attack And The  Anti-Marshall, Open Variations, Slow Systems, Steinitz System, Exchange  Systems, Berlin And Bird Defences, and so on. Only 124 pages, the book is  an excellent (and non-intimidating) overview of a complicated opening. You  may need (for you Master wannabees) a current book for  &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; variations, but for plans? This is the place.	2000-03-24

Using lucid prose and numerous diagrams, Lasker - a strong international master-level player in his day - teaches the newcomer  the basic principles of opening development, combinations, and endgame  principles. What I particularly like is the author's no nonsense approach:  he doesn't dumb down nor does he attempt to overwhelm with variations. One  shouldn't be put off by the book's age (I think it was written in the  1920s): You're getting first-rate, world-class instruction for a  bargain-basement price.	2000-03-24

Love uses model grandmaster games to emphasize key concepts such as  minority attacks, weak color complexes, closed games, etc. I think that  intermediate players, say 1500-2000 USCF, are best-suited for this book  since stronger players have probably mastered this info and less advanced  players are still dealing with more tactical problems.

So, I really needed a compelling reason to buy another tactics book. I found Nunn's treatment of  tactics to be different in that Nunn's focus is on evaluation of a  position, calculating and analyzing, rather than simply finding the  &quot;brilliant&quot; or trick move that forces a mate. In other words,  unlike beginner tactics books (say, Reinfeld's 1001) where there are  hundreds of queen sacrifices forcing mate, Nunn's examples are more  pragmatic and needing of careful calculation. Of interest is Nunn's  background info on tournaments of the past - so we aren't simply solving  problems out-of-context - which is fascinating. If you're a player, rated  1400-2100, you'll probably find this book extremely useful for long-term  problem solving abilities. Other good books on this subject include  &quot;The Best Move&quot; by V. Hort and Jansa, and &quot;Test Your  Tactical Ability&quot; by Y. Neishtadt.	2000-03-02

Don't misunderstand me - I liked this book when nothing else was available.The basic premise of books like this is that if one becomes familiar (through repeated exposure) to positions like the 1001  presented,one will be far more likely to see the same tactical patterns in  one's own games. OK, there's probably a great deal of truth to that.  HOWEVER, in twenty years as a near-master player, I've had few serious  tournament and non-tournament games where I've sacrificed a queen leading  to mate yet Reinfeld has close to 300 queen sacrifices! He has nearly 100  composed problems that are so artificial as to be useless for  &quot;pattern&quot; purposes - though admittedly finding the tricky move is  fun. There are plenty of more realistic problems (storming the castled  position, harrying the king, discovered check, etc.) BUT even here their  effectiveness is greatly reduced by the fact that they always lead to  forced mates in one or two or (heaven forbid!) three moves. The point is  Reinfeld's focus is on forced move sequences leading to mate. Fun to solve,  great for beginners up to a point, BUT very misleading! I've won hundreds  of speed games, game/30, tournament games, through &quot;boring&quot;  knight forks, creating &quot;dull&quot; pins, and looking for undefended  pieces for &quot;cheapo&quot; double attacks, where I win a pawn or an  exchange. Those are the patterns we need to drill on. Yeah, the book's only  a few bucks and it is fun, so you can't go too wrong but would it kill you  to win a pawn once in a while?	2000-02-17

Included is a section containing varied positions and  studies which test the player's understanding without indicating the type  of combination involved. The positions are virtually all taken from games  and the solutions discuss alternative moves. The positions are more  difficult than either Reinfeld &quot;1001&quot; book's positions, less  dramatic (few one-move queen sacs leading to mate) and more likely to occur  (e.g., an exchange on one side leading to the loss of a suddenly undefended  piece/pawn.) That is this book's main strength: presenting tactics that  you're likely to see often. I have rarely sacrificed a queen, delivered a  smother mate, or checkmated a king after a double rook sac in  serious  games but I've often decoyed a defender away from defending a pawn/piece,  exploited a pin, or &quot;destroyed a guard.&quot; If you can find this  book, it's worth considering.	2000-02-17

What  evidence really makes the author believe that racism is so endemic, so  volatile an issue, that now there will be a race war? If anything, there  seems to be LESS tension than ever before. I disagree with some of the  other Amazon reviewers that the author is racist - apparently they believe  if anyone suggests that white supremacist views are not uncommon, or even  that white supremacy is not a &quot;natural&quot; law, they grow offended.  This book may in fact appeal to that segment of the population, especially  to that small percentage of the white population, that is actively  anti-minority, and they may be its biggest readers because they want  confirmation of their wished for race war.	1999-12-16

However, BE WARNED, NCO has little or no prose explanations of its  evaluations(You've got to figure out why White is better, worse, etc.),  neither are &quot;thematic&quot; ideas discussed. And NCO does not give  those plausible or discredited lines that Kasparov, Karpov, and Anand would  never play but are played by that smug fellow at your local club (So you're  still on your own, unless he does you the favor of playing the  &quot;best&quot; lines). Finally, unless you're familiar with ECO  cataloging, the format isn't all that friendly (You've got to know what the  Benko Gambit is to look it up, for example). I am only rated USCF 1940, and  prefer more tutorial advice than NCO gives, and really prefer Modern Chess  Openings Edition 14 by N. DeFirmian as it also gives one page intros to the  major lines (as does NCO) but ALSO gives prose evaluations as to why White  is worse, better, etc.. It is also VERY easy to look up openings, and its  introductions make one curious to play out an opening. Take a look also at  Standard Chess Openings by Schiller which is filled with prose desriptions,  discussion, and analysis of the openings, as well as opening tips,  repertoire possibilities. The drawback though is that other players claim  it is far shallower than either NCO or MCO, as well as being less accurate.  I have NCO and MCO, the first is for &quot;status&quot; and the second, for  use.	1999-12-15

I'm no grandmaster, master, or even  candidate master, so I will not dare to evaluate any particular line for  holes in their variations. I will say that for a class A player, like  myself, or below, MCO-14 is far more useful, than say, Nunn's Chess  Openings for the following reasons: 1) More (and better) verbal  descriptions of the openings. The one page intros make one want to take out  the chessboard and play an opening. 2) Prose evaluations of the variations  explaining why a player is better or worse, or why a position is unclear.  NCO uses only symbols. Which is good if you're some hotshot international  player who lives or dies on some obscure variation of the Sicilian Defence,  or whatever. 3) Easier look up of openings. MCO-14 organizes the openings  under double king pawn, double queen pawn, etc. and gives the inital moves.  This is very helpful if you don't know an opening's name or ECO code (or  even what an ECO code is). NCO arranges by opening name, and in ECO  order  (although there is an index, none that great, in the back). They are both  great books but for the above reasons, you might consider MCO-14 first.	1999-12-15

I  didn't feel this book gave either; humiliating experiences are distributed  throughout, briefly commented on, Linda says it was horrible, and the  chronology goes on. The book could have been redeemed if the writing were  more compelling, muscular, vigorous, clever, but it's not. It's just a  chronology of events (&quot;this happened, that happened, then this  happened&quot;) that renders Linda Lovelace's experiences boring and  passionless. I am not commenting on whether or not Linda was, as she  claims, the unwilling victim of a natural catastrophe (i.e., Chuck  Traynor)but just on the style in which the story is told. Boring. Boring.

The book has 13 chapters covering the  Max Lange attack, Petroff Defense (where he recommends the Cochrane gambit  1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 Nxe5 d6 4 Nxf7), Philidor Defense, Latvian Gambit,  French, Sicilian (30% of the book, where he advocates 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3  Bb5), Caro-Kann, Modern, Pirc, Alekhine, Scandinavian, Nimzovitsch Defense,  and an &quot;odds-and-ends&quot; chapter covering relatively uncommon  moves. The author does not just give theoretically sound book moves but  also club player moves that all of those white players not facing Kasparov  are likely to see. Non-masters appear to be the target market for this book  (USCF 1400-2100) since this book cannot cover every opening in depth. I  think players who want a sound repertoire from which to develop from would  do very well with this book. I'm 2001 USCF and I enjoyed, use, and will  build upon this foundation.	1999-12-01

Part One covers the main line ( 1 e4 c5 2 Nc3 Nc6 3 g3 g6 4 Bg2 Bg7 5 d3 d6 6 f4 e6 7 Nf3 Nge7 8 0-0 0-0). 9th move  alternatives are presented in three chapters. Part Two gives sixth move  alternatives for white. Part Three involves early deviations - when black  plays ...e7-e6 and ...d7-d5. One chapter covers 1 e4 c5 2 g3 for white.  Each book chapter ends with a verbal summary and move order summary, along  with associated games. 100+ Grandmaster games are used to illustrate the  chapter ideas. The games' opening moves are thoughtfully annotated,  although lower-rated players (like myself, 1950 USCF) will really have to  dig to find &quot;thematic&quot; ideas on their own. This book is a Chess  Press Opening Guide book, part of their opening series. So, if you own one  of their other books, you will know the format.

I like that their  &quot;outline&quot; doesn't require one to necessarily rely on a religious  or supernatural belief that not everyone will necessarily share, nor do  they have a one-size-fits-all approach that equates success with happiness.  Although I don't really want some psychologist, self-help author, or  religious leader to prescribe a detailed magic formuala for happiness,  other people may miss having a detailed course of &quot;what do we do  now?&quot; Another weakness (unavoidable) is that the author's acknowledge  that perhaps only 50% of happiness is voluntary, the other half may be  genetically or biologically determined, that is hardwired into us. Still,  we have to start somewhere. I think that the 9 choices are useful to  evaluating the way we leading our lives and making some improvement.	1999-11-23

I'm only rated 2012 so I can't comment on  whether or not Grandmaster King's analysis is sound at the world champion  or grandmaster level (and neither, I think, can most of those who attack an  opening they don't care for), but at the level that thousands of us play,  this is a book that will be invaluable.

Actually, the layout of variations within Fine's book make it of little use  if you're a casual tournament player looking for some info on a specific  opening. Really, this is a bookshelf book. You know: a classic work, in its  day, not all that useful now. Just like Ptolemy, or Copernicus, or Newton  wrote classic works, Fine's relevance is mainly historical.

His rebirth poses  a threat to the existing powers-that-be and they do their best to eliminate  him. Virtually no characterizations worth recalling, and little plot. This  was not one of Van Vogt's better books, and if I had read this before  &quot;Empire Of The Atom&quot; I would not have bothered with any other Van  Vogt books. Read &quot;Empire&quot; for a fun, silly, INTERESTING old-style  science fiction fantasy where spaceships, empires, bows and arrows,  mutants, etc. abound.	1999-08-29

You know, in the sense that impersonal global economic forces and (often, but not always) unconscious racist and/or bigoted  mindsets produce a &quot;conspiracy&quot; to enslave or marginalize other  social classes, races, countries, etc. But Tony Brown really means actual  dues-paying, lodge-going, smoking-jacket-wearing, elitist secret societies  with world-wide nefarious intentions. I think he wrote this while watching  that TV series where outer space alien lizards that look like people but  are really lizards are running the government and dating most of the really  good-looking women. He sure doesn't offer evidence, probably because he's  &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; and doesn't want to clutter our minds  with facts. So he relies on weasel phrases like &quot;could usefully be  called&quot; when he should be giving evidence. I watch his program, and he  seems normal. This book is weird.	1999-08-16

Soltis has written an engaging and informative endgame book that makes one WANT to  learn more. Years ago, after trying to study endgames from Fine's  &quot;Basic Chess Endings,&quot; I had wearily resigned myself to ignoring  them primarily because Fine's basic work seemed enormously long, tedious,  and boring.

A great book to keep with you  in the car, or subway, at lunch, etc., to solve at your leisure. Probably  the simplest, most efficient, easiest way to improve your chess.

It is a series of positions, actual and possible, from K's games, that Pandolfini analyzes in detail.

When I was under 1700 I loved this book because I could get a general  understanding of several main openings and get a taste of what seemed  interesting. If you're a relatively lower-rated player, you'd probably be  better off investing most of your time on tactics, and leaving those 20  move variations to the masters.

I was reluctant to purchase this book at first because how many times can we go over the same concepts and practical advice (&quot;Study  master games. Study your games. Read books on positional play. Solve  combinations.&quot; And so on...)? But Tisdall writes engagingly about the  confusion we all experience once we leave the sterile, analysed positions  in our texts (Chapter 1). He offers a way to develop that &quot;vision  thing&quot; through blindfold chess (Chapter 2). And if we mess up? Playing  bad positions (Chapter 3). When we're at the board, can we recognize  patterns that will give us ideas on how to proceed? (Chapter 4).  Chapter 5  shows how piece values change during the game. The last chapter is  concerned with various practical tips that every chessplayer could use now  and then. This is not your standard, &quot;here are the laws of chess&quot;  text.

The author is naively impressed that this multi-billion dollar corporation was able to catch-up in a market that it should never  have fallen behind in to begin with! He views MS's success as a matter of  brains, speed and talent- and pays little attention to how the software  behemoth simply was up to its old tricks: force companies to carry your  product, the same way it forces, for example, Compaq to load its operating  system onto every computer it sells. Writing as though describing the  activities of a hard-pressed, plucky, band of computer savants, the author  misses the mark.

Davies' experience as a chess coach shows: he focuses on practical tips for  improving &quot;the vision thing&quot;: calculating, tactics, plans,  developing opening repertoires, etc. Unlike Nunn, he doesn't drift (e.g.,  into a detailed, intricate discussion of an endgame that only strong  masters could truly appreciate). Unlike Tisdall, Davies offers advice on  opening repertoires, computer chess, and elementary pawn formations. The  biggest drawback to this book is the impression, from the middle three  chapters (on playing against three different current faddish openings),  that Davies simply wanted to fill out the book. If he had, instead,  integrated his earlier chapters, with an exposition on three different  possible opening reps, that would have been more logical and timeless. Too  bad - Davies is truly an author in line with his target audience, the  others, I think, aim a little high.	1999-07-06

Of course, one  looks at the board, gets ideas, selects candidate moves,and evaluates  possible positions. And Soltis provides plenty of examples yet having  studied the book, I can't honestly say I'm doing anything better. Not his  fault, I know, still I wish these GM authors would remember that although  THEY can look at a board and unconsciously, automatically, find a plan and  possible move sequences, weaker players need more protection in the  clinches. They need sometimes to work backwards: visualize the desired  position first. Sometimes they need examples that explain WHY the author  chose certain candidate moves, move orders, and so on. This book's  intention are great, the introduction fantastic, the remaining chapters  leave a great deal to be desired. Everyone else seems to find this a great  help, but I actually feel my already shaky ability decreased after reading  it. GMs should coach ordinary mortals first.	1999-07-05

I am not a fan of Pandolfini. His books are mainly for the extreme novices, I know, but even so, they all seem so  &quot;gimmicky.&quot; Oh well, I don't want to be a snob but I will relay  this bit of trivia: I've never heard anyone, in any club, tournament, or  chat group, speak positvely of his Fireside series.

If you are more interested  in story than in overly-detailed pseudo-scientific,  engineering-manuals-disguised-as-novels, then this a book worth reading. I  read it as a boy, and re-read it 15 years later, and was still deeply  moved. Very few of the hundreds of science fiction novels I've read remain  with me. This is one I treasure.	1999-06-12

Dyer apparently wants you to just accept his word about how-the-world-works, and offers you spiritual  principles that he seems to have pulled out of the air or from other  authors. Yet reading them, ignoring the contradictions inherent in being a  spiritual person while simultaneously trying to get that promotion, or  &quot;anything&quot; else you want, I couldn't see any real practical  value. You can chant or meditate all you want, and aside from the inner  peace that might result (which should be enough), it is extremely unlikely  you'll be able to directly acquire any &quot;real&quot; world goods: a job,  relationship, financial security. Having studied and practiced many New Age  and Christian beliefs, I realize that these &quot;spiritual  principles&quot; are more likely to get one to accept the way things and  criticise oneself for not having enough faith, then to getting anything you  want. Surely our local libraries have dozens of texts with the same sort of  pap. Buy a book with down-to-earth practical principles.	1999-05-23

Here are the invincible Capablanca's thoughts on various chess themes as well as fourteen annotated games. When  I was a non-master, I read this book carefully: replaying the positions,  setting my computer, and following Capa's plans. I think that if one  carefully studies this book (and not merely moving pieces on the board),  one can get a solid foundation for further improvement.	1999-05-22

I have been a 2100+ USCF-rated player for fifteen years (I am thirty years-old)and have never quite made it to master-level play. Talk about a plateau! Anyway, I found this book's  practical approach to the problem of chess self-improvement refreshing and  unusual. The author is, I think, very much like the engineers I work with:  eccentric, precise, literal, and his book reflects this. His approach to  solving time-pressure problems is overly complicated, his analogies  needlessly detailed. He defines the components of chess strength, states  that any one of which negatively impacts all the others (the  &quot;weak-link&quot; concept), and then admits that several of the  components are largely un-improvable. There is useful info here (I like his  emphasis on studying one's own games for one's weaknesses), but upon  reflection, I could have skipped the book and: 1. Studied my own games for  MY specific strategic and tactical weaknesses. 2. Studied master-level  games for ideas by the world champions. 3. Studied tactical problems to  improve my calculating abilities. 4. Exercised regularly for physical and  mental well-being. Come to think of it, I already do the above. Read this  book, it's competently written, decide for yourself, but these books are  like diet and self-improvement texts: they sometimes work only because a  plan, an active plan, is better than just waiting and hoping for luck.	1999-05-20

Could it be because the author is a something of a therapist herself?<br />Why do so many of her subjects speak as though they were reading paragraphs from textbooks on psychological disorders, myths, and sociology? Was it because the author  owns a few herself?<br />I'm not disputing the author's many anecdotes and  encounters with would-be vampires. Let's assume they're ALL true, but...so  what? What does it all add up to?<br />The reality is that most of these  wannabe vampires are marginal characters, day-dreaming that they are not  clerks in pawn-shops, strippers living in transient hotels, bartenders  serving drunks from hole-in-the-wall dives. Instead, they are powerful,  sexy, immortal beings with tragic flaws.<br />Having dated women whose  fascination with this taboo &quot;other side&quot; led to their claiming to  be vampires (at least psychic ones), I found the whole thing tedious. Most  of these vampires, I feel, could just as easily claim to be reincarnated  Atlantians, Martians, 30,000 year-old Native Americans, or werewolves, for  all they know of vampirism and its associated history.<br />Maybe a little  humor (though not of a condescending sort) might have helped. I'm not  attacking the author, I just find too much dignity given to a subculture  with an unusually high percentage of delusion time-wasting dreamers.	1999-04-13

Silman's idea and explanation of examining and using a position's imbalances, finding a realistic position, visualizing a desired position and then attempting to see if it can be obtained was worth the book's  price. <br />Did Silman invent this &quot;method?&quot; No, you can find it  assumed in other books, but Silman explicitly creates the framework.  <br />Does he explain his method clearly? Yes, I've used his method  successfully in my games and in studying other chess books. <br />Is Silman  the last word? No, the many typos, redundancies, omissions, etc., make this  a less-than complete book. <br />Will this book help improve your game? I  think it should not only increase your skill level but will also help you  to get more out of other &quot;better&quot; books on tactics, strategy,  endgames, and so on. <br />Silman is a must read for all non-Master rated  players who want to be Masters.	1999-04-12

No argument from me (ELO 2023) about the &quot;7 Samurai Principles&quot; - they seem sound enough. The problem remains: HOW do we translate them into effective chessplaying?

Dr. Bardach has been able to convey a difficult, sad,  tragic experience into a eminently readable account that does not leave one  depressed by its witnessing of the dark angels of our nature, but treasure  the ability of hope and humanity to struggle on and find something to  strive for against all hope.	1999-04-09
