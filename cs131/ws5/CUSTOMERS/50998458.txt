The author has a keen sense of the majesty of time and he very effectively imparts this greater view to the reader. He deals with the background to a very significant find in ancient civilization. However, to validate placing Thera (Santorini) in the context of Atlantis, Pelligrino cites Plato but suggests the learned man didn't understand math and referred to a culture destroyed not 9,000 years before but 900. Pelligrino, in insisting on a small Mediterranean island as Atlantis also challenges Plato's knowledge of geography. In the Critias Plato describes three distinct seas -- The Mediterranean, which Plato described as &quot;merely a harbor, having a narrow entrance&quot;, the named sea (The Atlantic), and that other that &quot;is the real sea (the Pacific), and the surrounding land that may truly be called continent (Asia).&quot; In fact the Mediterranean could not have supported a climate such as that found in Plato's lush Atlantis 9,000 years before his time -- ice-sheets dominated all of Europe. As to inconsistencies with the legend, Pelligrino complains, &quot;All we have is Plato's word.&quot; Untrue. There are other sources both in ancient times and currently. The most significant are Andrew Collin's GATEWAY TO ATLANTIS, Colin Wilson's ATLANTIS BLUEPRINT, and Ivar Zapp's research into the remarkable spheres of Costa Rica, ATLANTIS IN AMERICA, Navigators of the Ancient World. All point to an actual Atlantis just where Plato said it existed. On this point Plato's words seem likely to outive Pelligrino's.	2001-08-17

In a groundbreaking work that describes over 60 sacred sites, from Jericho to the stone spheres of Costa Rica, Colin Wilson and Rand Flem-Ath give us much more than a glimpse of ancient civilizations before a universal cataclysm wiped them out -- they give us substance. The origins of these civilizations and the exact nature of their technological skills remain hidden -- these were coastal city-states built when sea levels were 400 feet lower and most proofs of their existence rest now under similar depths of water. However, not all is lost. These civilizations have left a scattering of lasting monuments and evidence of interconnection that has long confounded traditional archaeology -- from similar methods of mummification (with evidence of cocaine and tobacco where least expected) to underwater pyramids. And in discovering their means of communication and contact -- via open sea navigation as described by Thor Heyerdahl and Ivar Zapp -- Wilson and Flem-Ath have uncovered a virtual blueprint, complete with ancient sacred alignments, that uses science to prove the existence if a continent that has long been confirmed by myth. To find one location of Atlantis that is not speculative, but confirmed by huge stones formed into perfect spheres see Chapter Six of this work which is almost wholly devoted to ATLANTIS IN AMERICA: NAVIGATORS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.	2001-03-27

Quite rightly, Collins dismisses small islands in the Mediterranean and the mid-Atlantic ridge as possible sights for the sunken continent, and he eventually concludes that the continent itself did not sink, although its coastal cities must have perished. Why? Because coastal cities of 11,500 years ago (the time given to the destruction of Atlantis by Plato) would have been built on land now 400 feet below the sea (at the end of the Pleistocene sea levels were 400-420 feet lower than at present. Where was Atlantis according to Collins? I want you to read the book. It is worth the Journey. And remember, much of the Caribbean is shallow shoal water that was once well above sea level.	2001-02-19

Coe has presented us with an excellent survey of the cultures and languages of Mexico.  However, he has excluded the Maya from this study.  I find this disturbing because, as Coe points out on p. 61, the oldest people in Mexico were those we have come to call the Olmecs. We don't know who they were, what language they spoke, or where they came from. But we have hints. Nahual (Aztec)poems speak of a lgendary land called Tamoanchan which existed before the Nahuatl speakers came to Mexica. Tamoanchan is not a Nahuatl word. It is Mayan and it means 'Land of Rain or Mist.' This indicates that the Maya were ancestral to both the Olmecs and to all pre-Columbian Mexican culture. They deserve more than a brief two paragraphs in this work.	2001-02-01

In this dispute Thomas has taken the high ground in presenting his fellow archeologists' point of view, but also in admirably presenting a long history of evils archeology has done unto Native Americans. In support of the NA position Thomas chronicles how archeologists, operating under a &quot;scientific racism&quot;, lied to the Indians, cheated them, and dug up tons of bones, often of very recent ancestors, and shipped them to museums in the East and in Europe. In this light Native American rage at the idea of disturbing even 9,400 year-old bones of a possible ancestor is understandable. Further, the Umatilla tribe's claim that &quot;our oral history goes back 10,000 years&quot; gives credence to their claim to the Kennewick bones and is substantiated by Thomas's telling of local Indian legends regarding Crater Lake (once Mount Mazama). These legends clearly relate events that occurred 7,600 years ago. Thomas presents a strong case for the NA position, and concludes that the anwer to this and other disputes between archeologists and Native Americans rests on &quot;a relationship based on mutual respect and consensus.&quot; The courts have now ruled in favor of the NA desire to forever inter Kennewick Man. However, Thomas has presented ample evidence that the pursuits of science should persevere. Amerindians, migrating from Beringia 11,000 years ago, did occupy much of North America for the first time, but there is growing evidence that they did not occupy all of the Americas alone or even for the first time. Tom Dillehay's exhaustive work at Monte Verde, THE SETTLEMENT OF THE AMERICAS, documents a people who thrived in southern S. America before Beringia migration was possible. Walter Neves' discovery of the earliest known American, E. Brazil's 11,500 year old &quot;Luzia&quot;, became all the more profound when Neves' tests, and independent morphologists' confirmations, found that Luzia's teeth and skull exhibited the characteristics of South Pacific Islanders. Discoverer James Chatters described Kennewick Man as having the morphology of a European, but he could as easily have been a Polynesian. We need to know. NA origin myths are very old but so are Central and South American myths which describe their founding as from across the sea. And the great spheres of Costa Rica, described in ATLANTIS IN AMERICA:Navigators of the Ancient World, show that an ancient seafaring culture existed in Central America many thousands of years ago.	2000-10-05

But the vehicle of this catastrophic change, a huge fragment of the exploding Vela supernova, is also depicted as the demolisher of the 10th planet, and, improbably, as a disrupter of all of the planets of the solar system, as if they were all sitting ducks in a row. Except in schoolbooks the planets almost never line up in an exact row, yet no explantion is given on how the Vela fragment, moving from the outer to the inner regions of the solar system could have collisions or very near misses with each planet. No explanation is given for how the polar regons of the Earth could be forever balmy if they never experienced the yearly six months of summer that our tilt affords them. Assertion after assertion is made with no actual scientific explanation, a minimum of incomplete footnotes, and no bibliography whatsover. The ATLANTIS ENIGMA is a wonderful compendium of far out ideas but it does not deliver on its cover's promises.	2000-10-03

Although this reader welcomes challenges to the dominant academic paradigm, these challenges must find support in scientific principle, not in wild speculation that leads to easily discredited pseudo-science. Noone supports his apocalyptic vision with spotty evidence that disregard's Isaac Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation: objects attract each other with a force that is varied by the density of their masses and that is diminished by the square of their respective distances. DIMINISHED BY THE SQUARE OF THEIR DISTANCE!  Thus a large Jupiter on the other side of the sun, and all the other planets to boot, cannot affect us nearly as much as our own nearby little moon.

Are we linked in some way we do not understand to the greater cosmos? Your daily horoscope is unlikely to tell you. Yet, the ancient Maya, builders of stone monuments that intricately measured the movement of the heavenly bodies and thus the passage of time, surely thought so. Following the lead established in Giorgio de Santillana's HAMLET'S MILL, Jenkins reaffirms the importance of the Precession of the Equinoxes, the stately sliding and displacement of the morning risings of the constellations of the zodiac -- each reigning for 2,160 years -- until a &quot;Great Year&quot; of 25,920 has elapsed, and the Precession has come full circle.  Unlike Santillana, Jenkins establishes the Maya, not the Sumerians, as the most ancient of astronomers. And his hero is not Gilgamesh but the Hero Twins of the POPOL VUH, the creation myth of the Maya. Jenkins believes that the act of one of the twins, Hunahpu, in shooting the heavenly ruler, Seven Macaw, from his throne, was in fact the removal of the reign of the polar regions of the galaxy, and the reestablishment of the galactic center. Jenkins views the falling from the sky of Seven Macaw as a metaphor for a change in the way we view the cosmos, not as an actual falling of a star, or a comet. Similarly, Jenkins views the 2012 end date for the current Mayan Age as a time when, &quot;All the values and assuptions of the previous World Age will expire, and a new phase of human growth will commence.&quot; His vision of the individual's connections to the galactic center owes much to Jose Arguelles' THE MAYA FACTOR: PATH BEYOND TECHNOLOGY. It is a hopeful look, but so, eventually, is the view of cyclical periods of destruction and regeneration.	2000-09-28

In Gould's provocative view, biodiversity itself is the crowning acheivement of evolution, not the linear progression that has seemingly culminated in Man. Gould points out that if life on Earth were condensed to one full year, man's part would be limited to a minute or two, &quot;the last sliver of earthly time.&quot; That mankind has been around for so short a time may, in Gould's nimble argument, demonstrate that he is an afterthought or an accident that may be an evolutionary dead-end, like the horse, and not the intended culmination of all life. This higher title would go to the simplest form, the bacteria that are unsurpassed in both their vast numbers and in their very long stay on Earth.  Certainly, the notion that man's existence is short-lived and possibly transitory runs counter to his dearly held conceit that evolution through natural selection has &quot;progressed&quot; from great simplicity to great complexity. By that view man could arrogantly contend that even if he wasn't around for most of existence, life has been pointing toward his emergence all this time. By demonstrating that diversity and the fullness of the tree surpass man's &quot;end of the twig&quot; belief in his importance, Gould has furnished a bullet to wound what he calls Man's fourth arrogance or conceit -- that of his necessary presence. The first three arrogances, described by Freud were: the belief that we lived at the center of the universe (destroyed by Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton), the belief that God created us in his image (destroyed by Darwin who &quot;relegated us to descent from the animal world&quot;), and the belief in the supremacy of our own rational minds (destroyed when psychology discovered the enormous power of the unconscious). To the three bullets described by Freud and the one from Gould, I would like to presume to add a fifth bullet, this one aimed at the conceit that progressive Europeans, inthe wake of Columbus, brought rationality and civilization to an otherwise pagan, static, and irrational New World.	2000-09-23

The message of Hamlet's Mill is that ancient knowledge of the Precession of the Equinoxes was transmitted from one generation to another, even from one age to another, through oral myths. Yet this serpentine presentation of that message, at times dramatic, at times even poetic, serves too often to obscure the message itself.  The importance of demonstrating that catastrophic events have not only occurred in man's collective memory, but have been recorded in myth, cannot be overemphasized. Hamlet's Mill should be one of the most important works of the past century. Yet it has failed to acheive that status. Perhaps the attempt to duplicate the communal and magical way of knowing, experienced by the ancients, is simply too foreign to our modern way of knowing, in which intellectual concepts can be more readily absorbed through a more direct presentation. Great knowledge is simple when perceived directly, difficult when obscured.	2000-09-21

Hapgood never mentioned Atlantis but many have read his words to say that it existed in Antarctica. Even if Hapggod's improbable belief that Antarctica lay 2,000 miles closer to the equator 11,500 years ago could be proven, Antarctica still could not have supported a climate such as that found in Plato's description of lush Atlantis -- only the central regions of the Americas, Africa, or southern Asia could have provided such riches. Further, there is no evidence of a superior civilization in Antarctica, while at the center of the Americas, a land that creatively connects the great ocean currents, there lie the most enigmatic relics of a great civilization -- the almost perfect stone spheres of Costa Rica.

M. Allen correctly rejects Ignatius Donnelly's reading of Plato which placed Atlantis as &quot;opposed to the Pillars of Heracles&quot; rather than &quot;across from the Straits&quot; as related in Sir Desmond Lee's  definitive translation. Thus Allen overcomes the common mistake that led  scores of Donnelly's followers to posit Atlantis as a sunken island in the  Atlantic (geologically unsustainable), rather than as an island-continent  across the Atlantic (the Americas) whose civilization was destroyed but  whose &quot;bare-bones&quot; still appear (Caribbean Islands). In choosing  Bolivia as the site of Atlantis Allen has also chosen an ancient megalithic  civilization of great antiquity built on the squared plain and canal system  described by Plato. Tihuanacu very probably was a recipient or contemporary  of Atlantean culture. The crucial problem with the &quot;Andes  Solution&quot; is that the Altiplano of present-day Bolivia stands 12,000  feet above sea-level. Plato's Atlantis had a navigational base at its  center that traded with sea-farers on a world-wide basis. Perhaps Allen is  &quot;half-right&quot; in identifying So. America as the  &quot;island-continent,&quot; one as large as Asia and Libya combined. The  Americas are in fact one continent -- a continent in antiquity because its  reaches north and south could not fully be described, an island because it  could be crossed easily from the Caribbean to the greater sea of the  Pacific. And at the center of the Americas, a land that creatively connects  the great ocean currents, there lie the most enigmatic relics of a great  civilization, the almost perfect stone spheres of Costa Rica. For another  argument on the nature and location of Atlantis read ATLANTIS IN AMERICA:  NAVIGATORS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD by Ivar Zapp and George Erikson.	1999-10-09

However, as long as Andrews, and many others, insists on a narrow interpretation of Ignatius Donnelly's mis-reading of Plato as to the location of Atlantis her scholarship will be open to derision by mainstream geologists. Donnelly's reading of Plato placed Atlantis as &quot;opposed to the Pillars of Heracles (Straights of Gibraltar)&quot; rather than &quot;across from the straits&quot; as related in Sir Desmond Lee's definitive translation. Thus Andrews, unfortunately to be included with scores of others, posits Atlantis as a sunken island in the Atlantic (geologically unsustainable), rather than as an island-continent across the Atlantic (the Americas) whose civilization was destroyed but whose &quot;bare-bones&quot; still appear as the islands of the Caribbean. Donnelly and his followers have failed to grasp the scope of Plato's knowledge which described three distinct seas: The Mediterranean which Plato described as &quot;only a harbor, having a narrow entrance,&quot; the named sea (the Atlantic), and that other that &quot;is the real sea (the Pacific).&quot; In fact, the North Atlantic of 11,500 years ago could not have supported a climate such as that described by Plato as lush Atlantis. With the geological knowledge available at his time, Donnelly can hardly be faulted for mis-placing Atlantis, but Andrews and others should not continue to repeat this key error -- particularly in light of known oceanography.	1999-10-09

The book has, however, one major failing -- that of paying homage to the Inquisition-inspired portrayal of the Americas as populated by savages.  Hancock states, &quot;...the great mystery of Central America is that a culture of such unmitigated ferocity was also a vehicle for profound religious ideas.&quot; He should know better but Hancock has mixed together truly ancient Mexico -- populated for thousands of years before Christ by Olmecs and the people who built Teotihuacan -- with the Mexico Cortez encountered in the 16th C., populated by the barbaric Aztecs. The Aztecs were relative latecomers to the Valley of Mexico, arriving as little as 300 years before Columbus. They built inferior pyramids -- mostly from broken stones and boulders of earlier constructions, they borrowed earlier spiritual beliefs -- including knowledge of Quetzalcoatl (who advocated the sacrifice only of flowers and butterflies), and they conducted the mass sacrifices so gleefully related by the historians under pay of the Church of the Inquisition. Were the Aztecs, as Hancock seems to say, contributors to the spirituality of Central America? No, they never got to Central America, and they marked a confused dead-end to thousands of years of pre-Columbian culture in Mexico. And although some savagery may have marked the decadent years of the Maya who did flourish in Central America and Mexico's Yucatan, it must be remembered that most of the Mayan city-states were built without defensive walls and with interconnecting canals and roads (sacbeob), signs of cooperative civilization, not the barbarism that marked the fortified cities of the Mediterranean and European regions.	1999-10-08

Both recognized that the weathering of these megalithic structures was the result of vertical rainfall thousands of years before dynastic Egypt, not floods nor wind erosion. Using the newly founded science of archaeoastronomy Bauval has wound the clock back and has successfully argued that the lion body of the Sphinx once faced the constellation Leo with a similar face, a stone fulfillment of man's repeated urge to re-create the heavens on Earth, but at a time when Leo was the rising constellation -- 12,000 years ago. In doing so they have helped open the door to marvelous discoveries about all the great star-oriented megaliths on Earth. These discoveries hearken back to a rediscovery of Plato's Atlantis, and the description of a civilization destroyed at about the same time as the construction of the megaliths of ancient Egypt, on a true island-continent.	1999-10-04

Even most of the establishment achaeologists have now come to admit that their doubts about Monte Verde's authenticity were misguided. Even Brian Fagan, who championed Beringia migration in the THE GREAT JOURNEY, has visited the site and called Dillehay's dates &quot;unassailable.&quot; In QUEST FOR THE ORIGINS OF THE FIRST AMERICANS E. James Dixon, once the chief archeologist at the University of Alaska, states that, while his mission was to prove older dates for Clovis man in the north, he found progressively younger dates there, suggesting that American cultures came from the south. In September of 1999 paleontologist Walter Neves revealed that an 11,500-year-old skull from central Brazil, &quot;Luzia&quot;, has the round eyes, large nose and pronounced chin characteristic of Australian aborigines and native Africans. If they came before land bridge migration was possible how did these people get to the Americas? Inter-oceanic travel in antiquity was dismissed as impossible by academics. Adventurer Thor Heyerdahl's voyages documented in KON-TIKI and RA II proved that raft voyaging on steady ocean currents was not only possible but was far easier than walking over thousands of miles of ice-sheets. The academics have continued to mock Heyerdahl, calling him a &quot;lucky adventurer.&quot; However, evidence of inter-oceanic travel thousands of years before the proposed founding of civilization in the Near East is building steadily.	1999-10-03

The voyage of the Kon-Tiki ranks as one of the great adventures of our era. But was Heyerdahl's journey that of a &quot;lucky adventurer&quot; whose theories could be justly dismissed as &quot;junk science&quot; by the archaeological establishment? Or did his knowledge that the seas were virtual conveyor belts unveil the possibility that ancient peoples were not limited to migration over land bridges but could more easily have voyaged in rafts over open seas? Tom Dillehay's dating of the Monte Verde site in Chile to 12,500 years ago -- hundreds of years before the Mackenzie corridor opened the remote possibility of Beringia (dry Bering Sea) migration -- seems to have driven a stake into the theory that man first migrated by land to the Americas. Now paleontologist Walter Neves has revealed that a 11,500-year-old skull from central Brazil (&quot;Luzia&quot;) has the round eyes, large nose and pronounced chin characteristic of Australian aborigines and native Africans.

Work Flawed Only by Limited Knowledge	Ignatius Donnelly's groundbreaking work suffers only from his mis-reading of Plato as to the site of Atlantis. Donnelly's translation of the Greek led to his placement of Atlantis as &quot;opposed to the Pillars of Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar)&quot; rather than &quot;across&quot; from the straits as related in Sir Desmond Lee's definitive translation (Desmond Lee was knighted in 1961 for his work in translating Plato). Thus Donnelly, unfortunately to be followed by scores of others, posited Atlantis as a sunken island in the Atlantic (geologically unsustainable), rather than as an island-continent across the Atlantic (the Americas)whose civilization was destroyed but whose &quot;bare-bones&quot; still appear (Caribbean islands). Probably, he failed to grasp the scope of Plato's knowledge which described three distinct seas: The Mediterranean which Plato described as &quot;only a harbor, having a narrow entrance,&quot; the named sea (the Atlantic), and that other that &quot;is the real sea (the Pacific), with a surrounding land that may most truy called continent (Asia).&quot; In fact, the North Atlantic 11,500 years ago could not have supported a climate such as that found in Plato's description of lush Atlantis. With the geological knowledge available at his time, Donnelly can hardly be faulted for mis-placing Atlantis, but we should not continue to repeat this key error.	1999-09-28

Yet through his geologic examination of the rain-driven erosion of the Sphinx he eventually aligns himself with these same dates while positing a celestial impact at about 9,500 BC that could account for the sudden end to the last ice-age, a date that matches Plato's account of the destruction of the civilization of Atlantis. All of this is much to his credit as Schoch's investigation overcomes the monolithic academic paradigm and he joins the &quot;outsiders&quot;, described by Colin Wilson as those who must defy conventional wisdom. In his investigation of Plato's account of Atlantis, Schoch correctly rejects an Atlantis in the Atlantic (where the ocean floor is rising, not sinking), and correctly dismisses any notion of Atlantis in the Mediterranean which Plato described as &quot;only a harbor, having a narrow entrance,&quot; but seems to endorse the idea of Atlantis in Antarctica, vis a vis Charles Hapgood, Hancock, and the Flem-Aths. However, he fails to grasp the scope of Plato's knowledge which described three distinct seas: The Mediterranean &quot;harbor&quot;, the named sea (the Atlantic), and that other that &quot;is the real sea (the Pacific), and the surrounding land that may most truly called continent (Asia).&quot; Could America have been Atlantis, the island-continent whose civilization was destroyed -- continent because its reaches and expanses north and south could not be fully described, island because it could be crossed easily from the Caribbean to the the greater sea of the Pacific? If so, the bare bones described by Plato would be the Antilles, not the cold Antarctic. The Americas form one island-continent -- the only island-continent that could grow lush tropical fruits and also have a navigational capital at its center.	1999-09-22

They have relied too heavily on Charles Hapgood's maps and theories such as the Piri Reis map which reveals and ice-free coastline on Antarctica and on the doubtful theory of crust displacement. Even if Hapgood's improbable belief that Antarctica lay 2,000 miles closer to the equator 11,5000 years ago could be proven, Antarctica still could not have supported a climate such as that found in Plato's description of Atlantis -- only the central regions of the Americas could have provided such riches in a then very cold world. Further, there is no evidence of a superior civilization in Antarctica, but at the center of the Americas, a land that creatively connects the great ocean currents, there lie the most enigmatic relics of a great civilization -- the almost perfectly spherical stone spheres of Costa Rica.	1999-09-22
