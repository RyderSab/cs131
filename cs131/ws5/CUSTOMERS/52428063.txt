In other words -&quot; Learning should be fun&quot;. Science should be fun; if it is presented appropriately, children will embrace it. The book of course is quite basic.<br />My interest in this subject goes beyond the limits of this book, but if you are looking for a structured plan for young children to learn in, then this book will give you some ideas.<br />I have one problem with the book, and that is they you pipe cleans formed in the shape of a square, cube, triangle, and then dip it into a bubble solution--They call this making a square or cubic bubble. It will of course cause a film to adhere to the shape made, but I would have rather seen instruction for actually blowing a cubic bubble by using a wand and straw. I thought that it would be nice if they showed how to make structures such as carousels or bouncing bubbles.  This of course maybe too advance for the age of the children the book was intended for, but not for those teaching.	2005-06-25

However, in that year \\"The Jazz Singer\\" received an award for introducing sound to film, and the category for which \\"The Private Life of Helen of Troy\\" was nominated was dropped.<br /><br />The portrait in this book of Helen is not what I had expected--she is a very frank and an opinionated woman yet conventional.	2005-06-25

Culpeper eventually set up his own healing practice near London. He was moved by the suffering of the poor and decided to help the them by selling medicines to them at a very cheap price and encouraged them to use local species.<br /><br />In the 17th century, the physicians were leaning more toward non-botanical medications such as mercury, arsenic iron and sulfur etc. It is most likely that the physicians of that day resented Culpeper's popularity and considered him a threat, since be made their secrets accessible to the common person--therefore they tried to discredit him.<br /><br />The people of England due to his genuine concern for them loved Culpeper. The colonist took his herbal to the New World as a medical reference and guide of when to plant and harvest these medical plants.<br /><br />His mistake was he threatening the near monopoly on medical knowledge that the College of Physicians enjoyed.<br /><br />This book contains a comprehensive description of nearly all herbs along with descriptions of their medicinal properties and instructions on preparing and using them to treat many different illnesses. It also included precise botanical illustrations. For 300 years this book was the standard for herbal remedies.	2005-06-25

Taylor (Illustrator; 90 black-and-white cartoons). Originally published, Doubleday, 1961.<br /><br />The limerick has a curious history and some say it is of Irish decent, but this is based on little evidence. It started out in innocence as nursery rhymes for children (Mother Goose). The first book of limericks 'The History of Sixteen Wonderful Old Women' was published in 1821. Although the term 'limerick' was never used. Edward Lear is still the master of this form of writing, in my opinion and he as well did not use the term 'limerick'. After Lear the limerick became extremely popular and was used on every topic imaginable-there were no limits to its use.<br /><br />This book is a collection of more than 250 famous and infamous limericks in these categories: Old Classics, Current Favorites, Tricks and Puzzles, Simply Ridiculous, Lightly Amatory, and Rollicking and Rowdy (these sections were considered unprintable).	2005-01-02

It is indispensable to students or anyone who reads books that have been written in the past, or for those with a curious nature.<br /><br />The dictionary is in alphabetical order with stories of how each word came into the English language and has evolved over time.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />Alcohol - Originally, alcohol was a powder, not a liquid. The word comes from Arabic al-kuhul, literally `the kohl'--that is, powdered antimony used as a cosmetic for darkening the eyelids. This was borrowed into English via French or Medieval Latin, and retained this `powder' meaning for some centuries (for instance, `They put between the eyelids and the eye a certain black powder made of a mineral brought from the kingdom of Fez, and called Alcohol,' George Sandys, Travels 1615). But a change was rapidly taking place: from specifically `antimony,' alcohol came to mean any substance obtained by sublimation, and hence `quintessence.' Alcohol of wine was thus the `quintessence of wine,' produced by distillation or rectification, and by the middle of the 18th century alcohol was being used on its own for the intoxicating ingredient in strong liquor. The more precise chemical definition (a compound with a hydroxyl group bound to a hydrocarbon group) developed in the 19th century.	2005-01-02
