Christina Dodd has always been an author I could count on to deliver the goods.  And boy does she deliver with this one!  The plot alone would have been enough to make me buy the book--a desperate \\"flirt\\" who needs employment is hired to teach a \\"fop\\" what a woman wants from a man.  Like all great Christina Dodd books, everything isn't what it appears to be and her hero, Jude (love that name!) is definitely no fop!  They end up teaching each other the finer lessons of love.  MY FAIR TEMPTRESS is a fantastic read!	2005-09-29

Everybody has their personal favorites but I've always said you can't go wrong with a book by Connie Brockway and MY SURRENDER proves me right again!  I just loved Charlotte and Dand!  I thought their banter hit all of the right notes and Ms. Brockway creates a delicious blend of sensual tension and suspense as she ties up all of the loose ends of her Rose Hunters trilogy.  I thought it couldn't get any better than MY PLEASURE but MY SURRENDER is right up there with the Best of Brockway!	2005-05-17

Ms. Dodd combines romance and suspense with a very deft touch, offering the reader the best of both worlds.  Teague was a totally hot hero and I loved Kate.

The writing was superb and did an excellent job of making me feel like I was experiencing every emotion with the characters.  Unlike some of the readers on this site, I didn't find Annabelle cold at all.  She was beautifully motivated from the beginning and watching her mature into her love for Simon was one of the main pleasures of the book.  I hate it when characters are perfect from the first page.  How boring!  This was not a historical romance with \\"wallpaper history\\".  Ms. Kleypas brought the Victorian era to life in stunning detail.  And Simon, oh, Simon!  He was one of the best developed characters I've read since Rhett Butler.  Also loved the interplay between the four friends.  I didn't feel like it was overdone or that it distracted from the romance at all.  The scene where Annabelle finally confesses her love for Simon was one of the most beautifully written that I've read in any romance.  I actually made my husband read it and said, \\"See!  This is how I feel about you!\\"  Overall, I think this book ranks right up there with the best of Judith McNaught and Julie Garwood.  I'll be standing in line at the bookstore when the next installment in the Wallflower series comes out.  Bravo, Miss Kleypas, for letting me share your world for one wonderful weekend!	2005-01-02

She took two characters, Natalie and Jack, and put them in an old Victorian house with an eccentric landlady and made magic happen.  The characters seem so real and so funny because they think exactly the way we would probably all think if we found ourselves in this situation.  Their thought processes and interaction ring totally true in a sort of Bridget Jones way.  The mafia and pop culture references made me laugh out loud.  With each encounter, you genuinely get a sense of Natalie and Jack falling in love.  Jack may be something of a mystery man, but it was fun watching Natalie try to \\"solve him\\".  I can't think of a more delightful way to spend an afternoon than curled up with a warm cup of cocoa and this book!	2004-11-23

I always love \\"royalty romances\\" anyway and this is one of the best plus a promising beginning to a new series.  I thought Princess Clarice was a wonderful heroine because she was smart and funny and her \\"make-up\\" lessons for the other women are priceless (and timeless!  I picked up a few tips myself.)  I thought Robert was one of the most winning heroes ever, so real and so sexy.  I couldn't blame Clarice for falling for him because I fell for him too.

I've always enjoyed Ms. Dodd's historicals and was doubly delighted when I found out she was dabbling in contemporaries last year.  This is the second book in her Prescott family series.  I liked Pepper just as much as I liked Hope in the first book.  And Dan, an ex Special Forces guy, made for a yummy hero.  I also liked the way she sprinkled some suspense into this book too.

Not only was he extremely sexy, but he also seemed like a real person with more than one side to his personality.  And I wanted to be Kate!  She was brave and feisty and a perfect match for Kit.  I loved this book because it had romance, adventure, and even a little twist of suspense.  I'm so excited because it seems to be the beginning of a trilogy.

I enjoyed this book for exactly some of the same reasons other reviewers disliked it.  It had a very fresh premise and it kept me turning the pages because I honestly didn't know what was going to happen next.  Helene starts out as a very sympathetic character and I felt that Rees was going to end up that way.  Eloisa James never disappoints.  Her lovely prose has such a ring of authenticity that you almost feel as if her characters and their situations could have really existed in Regency England.  A fabulous read!	2004-04-12

This is a book review site, not a political forum.  That having been said, I HAVE read the book and thought it was wonderful.  It's simply one soldier's story.  Jessica Lynch could have been any of our sons or daughters.  It's not exactly her fault that's she's petite, cute, blonde or white.  Rick Bragg does his usual masterful storytelling here.  His simple prose often reads like poetry, yet he never editorializes, but simply allows the reader to draw their own conclusions about the events as they occur.  He does an especially lovely job of bringing Wirt County and that particular corner of West Virginia to life.  At its core, this  book is about the triumph of faith over reason, and one young girl's stoic courage in the face of great adversity.  Bragg remains one of my two favorite living writers, along with Anne Lamotte.  Jessica, we salute you.  You may not claim the title of hero, but that's exactly what you are to myself and many others throughout not only America, but the world.	2004-01-07
US	48954313	R1SHXR56SGS640	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	1	11	16	N	N	Badly written book	This book started out with some promise, but before long I decided it was poorly plotted, poorly researched and poorly written.  Some have compared it's pacing to that of a Saturday matinee serial, but I've seen much more compelling Flash Gordon serials.  Langdon and Sophie were absolutely flat on the page, without even enough life to be called caricatures.  The &quot;revelations&quot; were without any emotional component and were dryly retold through narrative.  The codes were so simplistic that I figured out most of them before Langdon or Sophie.  This is like a &quot;paint by numbers&quot; suspense novel, but without the numbers.  I think the book panders to its audience by giving readers who aren't educated in religious history or art history the illusion that they're reading something intellectual.  Although certainly one of those rare publishing &quot;phenomenas&quot;, I'm not even sure this one deserves a space on the bookshelf next to BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY or JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL.  Harry Potter, where are you???	2003-11-26

I know it's fiction, but I find it disturbing that those who are unfamiliar with either Biblical or Art history might embrace Brown's attempt to discredit the divinity of Jesus Christ.  There are many flaws in his theory.  Christ never demeaned women.  If you look at every episode where Christ encountered a woman in the New Testament, his tenderness and respect is evident.  Also, Mary Magdalene was probably old enough to be Christ's mother.  In Greek, the oldest woman was always listed first and in every instance where Mary Magdalene was listed in the New Testament, she is listed first, even before Jesus's mother.  Which probably made her a woman comfortably into middle age.   I don't know if Brown just has a bone to pick with the Catholic church, but he treats it as if it's the ONLY Christian church in existence.  There are plenty of us Bible-believing non-Catholics out there who believe the Bible is God's holy word and are trying to worship and live our lies in accordance with the guidelines Christ left for us in the New Testament.  Christ was both divine and human and that's the major point that Brown seems determined to discredit.  If you can suspend disbelief and not mistake the combination of legend and conspiracy theories for fact, then you can probably enjoy this book.  A similar, but much better written, book is the cult classic THE EIGHT by Katherine Neville.	2003-11-23

It's been a long time since I've met characters I liked as well as Henrietta, Darby, Josie, and Anabel.  And Eloisa James's writing is absolutely exquisite.  When you couple that with her deft touch for characterization, her tender empathy for the human condition and all of its lovable absurdities, her astonishing historical accuracy, and her musical ear for dialogue, well, you have a true gem of a book.  I laughed out loud, I cried, and when I turned the last page, I sighed with absolute and utter satisfaction.  Eloisa James is truly one of the brightest lights of the historical romance genre and I look forward to watching her shine for years to come!	2003-08-30

There are only a handful of authors who have me running into a bookstore to buy their new books and Anne has been one of them from way back.  I literally read INTO THE FIRE in one sitting on a plane and I was afraid I was going to be next infamous case of spontaneous combustion.  That's how hot Dillon and Jamie's relationship was.  I loved their backstory and I'm so glad that Ms. Stuart isn't afraid to be politically incorrect and to write about fascinating, flawed characters who are redeemed during the course of the story.  That's always been the mark of wonderful fiction.  She's a writer who's not afraid to take chances and she definitely tapped into my primal fantasies with this book.  An excellent read!	2003-08-03

I've always enjoyed Ms. Dodd's historicals and it's great to see her voice translate so well into contemporary.  Zack was so much in need of the joy Hope could bring into his life. I liked the fact that Hope was an innocent when she met Zack.  And I love books where the two main characters are a little flawed, but grow during the course of the book.  To me, that's the sign of great fiction!  JUST THE WAY YOU ARE is definitely my favorite contemporary of the summer.  It was both sweet and hot!	2003-08-02

It was written in 1972, it was one of the first times women were allowed to read about sex outside of male pornography, and it was before the darkest and most delicious of female fantasies were sanitized by the modern scourge of \\"political correctness\\".  It's immensely readable and the prose isn't purple, it's excellent writing.  Perhaps Brandon should have been redeemed sooner; perhaps Heather should have displayed more spine, but within the historical setting of 1799 and given the age of the characters (17 & 35), it's actually probably more accurate than many of the romances written today where all the young misses are feisty and all the gents are enlightened.  I first read the book when I was 15.  I'm 39 now and still have trouble putting it down whenever I pick it up.  As someone else so wisely said, it was written to be enjoyed, not analyzed.  And I will never understand the readers/women who claim to be feminists, yet want to censor other women's fantasies as part of your political agenda.  As a woman and a feminist, I'll read whatever I please, thank you, and that includes this marvelous classic.	2002-04-13

Enid and Stephen are fully fleshed out (no pun intended!) and their verbal sparring does a poor job of hiding their passion and desire for each other.  I'd read about the similarities to Linda Howard's WHITE LIES, too, but found that controversy to be nothing but a tempest in a teapot.  Even Linda Howard posted on one of the reader bulletin boards that she found the small degree of similarities to be totally coincidental, no more than might be found in any &quot;amnesia&quot; story.

RIVER OF EDEN was a delicious combination of adventure, romance, and mysticism which mixed sizzling sensuality with edge-of-your-seat suspense.  The book is totally unique in its own right, but it did bring to mind the very best of the genre--ROMANCING THE STONE, THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and AMAZON LILY by Theresa Weir.

This is yet another example of an arrogant, prideful man trying to replace God's perfect plan with his own flawed one.  There is only one God.  He had only one son.  It was necessary that His one and only son die as a sacrifice for our sins so that we might be reconciled with Him.  It's a simple and beautiful plan that provides for the salvation of mankind.

I'm a ... for style and I have to tell you it wasn't just the spinetingling suspense that drew me in, it was Ms. Gerritsen's gift for crafting an unforgettable and moving sentence.  Even the smallest scenes, such as the one between Detective Moore and his dead wife's mom, were beautifully drawn.  She makes her characters both sympathetic and accessible, so that we actually care when their lives and sanity are threatened.  This is one author who just keeps getting better with every book.

Sadistic story masquerading as children's fiction	Okay, I love Harry Potter.  I love Roald Dahl and Charles Dickens.  I love the Addams Family and the episode where Susan died from licking cheap stationery on \\"Seinfeld.\\"  But I hated this book!  I found it incredibly sadistic toward children.  When a man tells a little girl on p. 49 (after \\"taking her face in his rough hands\\"), \\"...try not to anger Count Olaf , or he might wreck that pretty little face of yours\\", I had to quit reading.  Babies are threatened with being dropped from high heights.  The baby is also locked in a birdcage, tied up, and left with a piece of tape over its mouth.  I'm sorry, but this sounds like the musings of some child-hating mysogynist to me and I couldn't bring myself to read another word.  I'm deeply disturbed that Harper is passing this off as entertainment for children.  For those who are comparing this to Roald Dahl, Charles Dickens, or Harry Potter when he was still living in the Dursley's cupboard, I can only say that those books had a message of hope, of good triumphing over evil.  THE BAD BEGINNING reminds me more of something someone's dirty-minded old uncle would write while huddled in his basement watching kiddie porn.  Ick!  I'm off to wash my hands and take this book back to the bookstore.	2001-09-04

(Especially while she's living off the royalties of the sale of her own book.) You can't put any price on developing a child's imagination and some of my most treasured possessions are the books I received in childhood. If I raised my kids like this, I suspect at least some of them would grow up never wanting anything &quot;used&quot; to touch their bodies again, since kids usually rebel against their parents' attitudes if too extreme. While there is nothing wrong with teaching your kids the value of money, this philosophy might also send them a simple, but consistent message--&quot;You're not worth it.&quot; Not worth the new shirt or the new toy or even the water consumed by bathing you daily. This is a dangerous psychology. The author might be doing something for the environment, but she's not doing much for the economy, especially the economy of another author (fiction)who would like to get paid for all of her hard work, thank you very much.	2001-08-27

This is by far the best STAR TREK novel I've ever read (and I've read plenty!), but it also tops my list of Best All-Around Novels.  David effortlessly weaves together an incredibly complex tapestry of timelines and characters from ST:TOS and ST:TNG.  I laughed out loud.  I came close to crying.  It's just a brilliant executed book that deserves 25 stars, not 5.  I just bought my first Peter David non-Trek novel, SIR APROPOS OF NOTHING, and can't wait to read it.  Other excellent Trek novels by Mr. David are IMZADI, Q-IN-LAW, and VENDETTA.	2001-07-23

I finished the book with tears streaming down my cheeks, but they were truly tears of joy and delight.  Laura was a hoot and Sterling was definitely a hero in need of some chaos in his life.  I was touched by the depth of emotion.  And I wish I had a crazy little sister like Lottie (I think!)	2001-07-17
US	48954313	R2PIJ4SI8YQNAN	0671035339	783615143	Sentimental Journey	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A masterful mainstream debut!	Jill Barnett has done a marvelous job on her first mainstream novel.  SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY is a lovely and lyrical journey to the past peopled with characters who are as genuine and relevant as our own friends and family.  She uses a deft hand and fast pacing to intertwine the five stories of the main characters as their lives approach a collision course.  To be honest, WWII fiction is a tough sell for me, but I couldn't turn the pages of this book fast enough.  The writing itself is exquisite and she brings alive the era with details that enhance, but never overwhelm this passionate story of ordinary people who possess extraordinary courage.  The final chapter made me want to smile, cry, and jump to my feet and yell, &quot;Bravo!&quot;	2001-07-02

It has a touching romantic reunion, gut-twisting suspense, and wrenching emotional impact.  I especially liked the development of the &quot;villain&quot; because it was done so subtly that even I began to doubt my perception of him.  Ms. Stockenberg excels at novels that explore the mother/daughter relationship and this one is no exception.  If you like suspense, romance, and family relationships all wrapped up in a credible story, TIDEWATER should make you very happy.	2001-06-19

Reviewer: Teresa Medeiros (see more about me) from Kentucky I took this book on vacation with me and got some very strange looks from the other passengers on the cruise ship when I kept bursting into hysterical laughter. It truly was delightful! The very concept of turning a group of cutthroat pirates bent on reforming themselves loose in a Scottish castle was priceless. For those who didn't find the book historical enough, I say &quot;Lighten up!&quot; The beauty of the romance genre is that there is room for a vast variety of stories and styles. I'll take the spark of magic I find in Jillian Hunter's writing over dry, emotionless research any day. And just because an author doesn't choose to indunate the reader with historical facts, it doesn't mean the facts she does include are in error. I only wish Errol Flynn and Olivia deHaviland were still around to star in the movie version of this one! The banter very much reminded me of something you'd find in one of their swashbuckling films and the scene in the church near the end brought a definite lump to my throat. Be true to your muse, Ms. Hunter, and continue to charm and delight us with your unique talent and voice!	2001-06-10

Rowling is the J.R.R. Tolkien of our generation.  What started out as a whimsical children's series a la Roald Dahl is now veering into darker, but equally captivating waters as an epic battle between good and evil begins to take shape.  I loved this book!  It made me laugh and it made me cry.  (And I desperately want my own house-elf!  Which of course I plan to clothe and compensate!)  As a Christian, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these books to anyone I know.  I believe the good Lord gave us our imaginations to craft just such well-written fantasies and Ms. Rowling has been exceptionally blessed.  The theme of good vs. evil is vital to Chrstian theology, just as it is to these wonderfully written and delightful novels.	2001-06-10

There's nothing wrong with metaphors or original descriptions.  (Personally I hate the current trend of books written entirely in dialogue with no sense of time or place.)  But there was a lot of overwriting here and it ended up feeling very self-conscious--milking the prose of its suspense, and slowing down the flow of the story to a crawl in spots.  ...	2001-05-28
