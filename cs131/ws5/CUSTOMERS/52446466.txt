There is nothing like getting attention from your enemies. Mr. Berkhoff's book only confirms the importance of the documentary film, even as it sets out to castigate, once again, the Ukrainian people as anti-semitic nazi sympathizers and collaborators. While a number of individulas did engage in deplorable anti-Jewish activities, the insinuations that Ukrainians and others as people, as an ethnic group are somehow guilty and even, as Morley Safer once put it on \\"60 Minutes\\", \\"genetically anti-smitic\\", is totally irresponsible and unacceptable. The Holocaust business is extremely sensitive to competition, especially to any from Ukrainians. And that, I believe, is one of Mr. Berkhoff's reasons for his book.	2004-11-19

Mr. Sol Littman, engages in a rather crude attack against Ukrainians, by pretending to have written a &quot;historical&quot; account  of the Ukrainian Division, which was organized by the Germans in WWII. The author is sympathetic to Soviet ideology, and feels that Ukrainian Division issue is an easy way to promote it. Ukrainians, as well as Latvians, Lithuanians, Estonians and Croatians were automatically designated as anti-semitic, and anti-Soviet, and a tremendous effort was made to discredit and destroy those particular groups by the Soviet propaganda machine and its supporters, such as Mr. Littman.<BR>It should be reminded, that the Ukrainian Division fought for Ukrainian independence, from the Soviet Union, and later on against Germany itself and Poland, as UPA partisans. Numerous Jews played a major role in the Red Army (created by Leon Trstsky himself), and particularly in the KGB shock trrops and its political and ideological enforcers.<BR>The reprisals carried out by the Ukrainian Division and by the UPA did indeed take place, and were always in retaliation against collaborators, many of whom, were Jews.<BR>Mr. Littman, of course, never speaks about the collaboration issue, which is inconvenient to his purpose.	2004-06-07

Linda Hodges' travel guide on Ukraine, while it has some shortcomings, is definitely full of valuable facts, and comes from the heart of the author, which is more than can be said about the reviewer's attack on the Ukrainian language and therefore its culture. To call the Ukrainian language &quot;pointless&quot; is quite an outrageous thing to say. While it is true that little Ukrainian was heard in the Eastern part of Ukraine ten years ago, the situation is quite different today, where one hears Ukrainian everywhere - in the streets, in schools, in government offices, even though Russian is still considered far more dominant in many areas. The use of the Ukrainian language is growing every year. One can't help but be somewhat surprised to see the obvious hostility towards Ukrainians. Why travel to the fascinating land of Ukraine with this kind of attitude? Perhaps one should confine his interests to travel in Russia, an equally fascinating country, where the Ukrainian language would not be such a threat.	2004-01-20

The historic facts show that the Vohlyn massacres were in retaliation for numerous instances of Polish brutality and murders committed by the notorious AK, the Polish Home Army against Ukrainians. It should be reminded that Ukrainians never fought on Polish territory, in Poland proper, but on their own ethnic territories, occupied by Poland for centuries. The Ukrainian-Polish conflict takes place throughtout the entire Ukrainian-Polish history, and greatly intensifies during the period of the new Polish independence between WWI and WWII, when Poland blatantly tramples on the rights of Ukrainians. Poland considered its colonial teritories in Western Ukraine as an integral part of Poland proper, where as Ukrainians never did so. In the same way that England had once considered India as an integral part of England. Mr. Piotrowski prefers to talk about Wohlyn from the point of view of a nationalistic Pole, without mentioning the unacceptable Polish policy of ruthless exploitation and discrimination  against the Ukrainian people.  A more balanced account of that sad period of Eastern European history would have been more welcome.	2003-09-09

The Ukrainian famine was planned by the Soviet Union and its gang of communist ideologists, agitators, propagandists and apologists in order to destroy the Ukrainian people and their opposition to the Soviet Union. Millions of innocent men, women and children died of starvation while the Soviet NKVD/KGB shock troops destroyed crops and forcibly took food from people's homes.<BR>The tragedy of the Ukrainian Famine rivals the Jewish Holocaust, a fact resented by some, yet it still remains largely unknown. It was deliberately suppressed during the Soviet era, and publicly denied in the U.S. by such notorious news reporters, as Walter Duranty of the NY Times, who, incredibly, won the Pulitzer Prize for his often distorted and false \\"news reporting\\". A massive drive is currently under way by Ukrainians in the U.S., Canada and Europe to posthumously strip Walter Duranty of the Pulitzer Prize he did not deserve, and the Pulitzer Committe is reviewing all the facts.

Surprisingly, Katie Wood still refers to the country of Ukraine, as &quot;The Ukraine&quot;, a term used in Tsarist and Soviet Russia to denote the subjugated state of Ukraine. The correct and the only way is to say &quot;Ukraine&quot;, without the article. Russian terminology is used throughout the Ukraine section, although the Ukrainian language is used  to indicate the names of places in  parenthesis.  We still see &quot;Kiev&quot; rather than the correct &quot;Kyiv&quot;, and &quot;Lvov&quot; rather than &quot;Lviv&quot;. In her effort to impress her readers with her imagined fluency of a foreign language, Katie Wood and her research staff have even used the wrong name for &quot;Lvov&quot;.<BR>Her comments on just how close the Russian and Ukrainian languages are - that only two silly letters separate  one from the other, for goodness sake,  is quite ridiculous and completely false. In reality, a Russian speaker will usually not understand the Ukrainian language at all. On the other hand, a Ukrainian will understand the Russian language, especially if he chooses to. On the whole, Europe By Train - 2003 is somewhat inaccurate and it's not recommended. Luckily, there are numerous other rail guides available.	2003-07-25

Attacking Ukrainian nationalists, and all Ukrainians who professed their love of the Ukrainian language and culture has been one of the top priorities of the Soviet regime and its supporters. Nationalism does not mean nazism, but the author is intent on \\"proving\\" that it does. 99 per cent of Petlura's political agenda had to do with Ukrainian independence, not with anti-semitism. The perception created by the Soviet Union is that all he ever did was murder innocent Jews. It is that perception that the author wants to believe. The reprisals which did occur were directed against Soviet-collaborators, responsible for the murder of many innocent Ukrainians.  The fact is, that often, such collaborators were Jewish.The assassin of Petlura was a Soviet agent. There were many other assassinations carried out on behalf of the Soviet Union.

The &quot;Ukrainian Minstrels&quot; by the Harvard-trained scholar and folklore authority, Natalie Kononenko, who currently teaches at the University of Virginia, is enormously interesting. Among the many intriguing characteristics of the Ukrainian folk tradition is the fact that Ukrainian epics were sung by a special type of minstrel - the blind mendicant. Yes, blindness was obligatory! These minstrels  were organized into professional guilds that set standards for training and performance and provided the singers with protection and support throughout their careers. Natalie Kononenko's book is a revelation of a distinctive folk tradition and a little-known social order. One learns about the difference between the kobzari and lirniki, since there were two types of minstrels, who played different types of instruments,  about the unique relationship between the established minstrel and his apprentice, the duration of training, and the extensive and fascinating repertoire one had to master. The book contains  many rare photographs of minstrels. One also learns about a great tragedy which befell the Ukrainian minstrels in the 30's at the hands of the Soviet dictator, Joseph Stalin, who like the villain in a Greek tragedy, organized a bogus minstrel convention in Moscow, where he had them arrested and murdered, and their instruments destroyed. Sort of a pre-cursor to the massacre of the Polish officers by Stalin at Katyn during WWII period. Highly recommended to any folklore enthusiast. A real treat!	2002-10-05

The Soviets, their collaborators and sympathizers worked hard to achieve Marxist goals - but in the end they failed, totally rejected and repudiated. Petliura became a national hero, and his stature only continues to grow, especially after the demise of the Soviet Union, as many facts about the assasination have come to light.

One of the most over-hyped and over-glamorized &quot;revolutionary&quot; figures in history makes us wonder if he ever really existed.  Most of the Che mythology was pure fabrication and had no basis in fact.  Hollywood couldn't have invented a figure more groovy, sexy or better-looking, even if it wanted to,  but the international communist movement did.  As Che and the entire cast of bigger-than- life &quot;revolutionary&quot; characters are fading fast into history, to be forgotten forever, you'd better read up on this macho man.	2001-01-21

A brave and much needed voice in a sea of corrupt and greedy Holocaust industry. A necessary companion to Mr. Norman Finkelstein's expose on the same subject.

Paul Robeson was a collosal dupe of the Soviet Union, who used him very effectively, and treated him royally when he lived in the Soviet Union, much of his life, while the average Soviet citizen barely got enough to eat. Towards the end of his life, Paul Robeson preferred to come home to die in America. The book is an interesting read about a misguided and manipulated African-American.	2001-01-08

Given the crowded field of the 19th century writers of the Russian Empire, Pushkin is not appreciated enough. And it's understandable - with Gogol, Dostoievski, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Goncharov and Chekhov around, Pushkin gets squeezed out. His prose and his plays are wonderful to read even in translation, and if you're lucky enough to be able to read Russian, his poetry is simply unsurpassed among the Slavic poets, even the Polish Mickiewicz and the Ukrainian Shevchenko. Pushkin the poet belongs with Shakespeare, Goethe and Byron. Pushkin's stories are fun to read, and are a good introduction to the big league Russian Empire writers that follow him.	2001-01-04

The subject of the Galicia Division, and other divisions, which were organized by the Germans during WWII to fight the Russians and the Soviet Union, in Ukraine and other countries - Latvia, Lithuania or Croatia usually gets the International Communist and Jewish interpretaion and is always termed as Nazi collaboration. Seldom do we hear the point of view of those who were actually fighting in those divisions. So it is refreshing to hear Mr. Logusz tell us his story. Accusing those who had fought against the Soviet oppression of nazi collaboration has always been a favorite subject of the Soviets and virtually all of the Holocaust-crazed Jewish groups, with the unfortuate result that it has come to unfairly castigate Ukrainians, Latvians, Lithuanians or Croats as nothing less than nazis. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the International Communist movement, we are starting to hear the other side, and Mr. Logusz has done a great job in that respect. We realize that the main reason for the creation of such divisions was anti-Communism and not anti-semitism.	2001-01-03

As far as revolutions go, the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917-1920 gets very little shelf space. In fact, it is still virtually unknown, although the facts have been coming out slowly over the past ten years, as they have been in many other areas concerning Ukraine and its people. This is an analysis of the Ukrainian national movement as it emerged at the time of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and gave Ukraine its chance to achieve independent statehood by seceding from Russia. Well written (and hard to find) by the eminent scholar, John S. Reshetar of Princeton.	2001-01-03

It is surprising to see Mr. Piotrowski give us such a broad and mostly fair analysis of the issues in Poland during the 1918-1947 period. Having read his &quot;Genocide and Rescue in Wolyn&quot;, in which he presents such a biased and distorted Polish view of Ukrainians and their struggle for independence, (which he terms as &quot;genocide&quot;, but which in reality was a struggle against Polish colonialism in Ukraine), I had to check and see if perhaps there were two Mr. Piotrowskis. In this book, Mr. Piotrowski examines the role played by the various ethnic groups, and in particular, focuses on the role played by the Jews, both in their complicity with the Nazis and, most of all, with the Soviets and the International Communist movement. This book helps to debunk the myth of Jewish exclusivity of the Holocaust.	2000-12-30

The updated version is even better. The kinks are mostly out. Linda Hodges' love for her beloved Ukraine still shines on every page of this very upbeat and somewhat rose-colored travel guide. It is the kind of Ukraine that you will surely find, if you go around a few unscrupulous people - in airports, taxis, restaurants or at border check-points. If you're lucky enough to have someone invite you to a private home, especially in small towns or villages, you may experience that legendary Ukrainian hospitality and the wonderful food that goes with it! And in spite of what one has heard, Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians don't live only in Halychyna; you will find them far to the east and south, and proud of their ancient heritage. Often, they will start out pretending to be Russians, but will end up singing those unforgettable Ukrainian songs with you, their eyes getting misty. Such is the case with most of the so-called &quot;Russian&quot; Ukrainians. Even true ethnic Russians will join in, since most Russian songs don't quite measure up. They like to be accepted and acknowleged, and forgiven for not being more Ukrainian, and they're impressed  by foreign visitors who want to know about Ukraine. The Soviet system has taught them that Ukrainians live only in villages and speak a Russian &quot;dialect&quot; called Ukrainian, so they've always tried to hide their true origins.   Unlike the hard-boiled approach to Ukraine travel by the politically over-correct Let's Go guide, Linda Hodges goes the more mellow route. You'll be seduced by her charm, make no mistake about it.

What William Shakespeare is to the English, Taras Shevchenko is to Ukrainians - beloved, revered and a continuous inspiration. In his brief and tragic life, Taras Shevchenko's accomplishments as a poet, artist and a national symbol are legendary and unsurpassed. Persecuted and driven to an early death  by the Tsarist government of Russia, and perverted and desecrated by the Soviets, Shevchenko's poetry and his undefeated spirit continue to soar today. A contemporary of Abraham Lincoln, Shevchenko epitomizes Ukraine's struggle to free itself from Russian and Polish oppression. Today, some of the former Soviet collaborators, supporters and sympathizers are attempting to discredit and defame the Ukrainian people and their beloved poet. Such attempts have been met with great indignation by Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians alike. A surprising recent article in the Washington Post had suggested the removal of the Shevchenko monument in Washington, DC, labeling it anti-Russian! The Shevchenko monument site in Washington, DC was authorized by the U.S. Congress and dedicated  by president Eisenhower in the early 60's. Morley Safer's despicable diatribe against the Ukrainian people and Shevchenko a few years ago on the CBS program, 60 Minutes, will never be forgotten or forgiven. Above it all, Shevchenko's beautiful and touching  poetry continues to inspire Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians alike.	2000-12-23

Bruno Schultz is one of my favorite odd and little-known writers, and I still own an old Penguin paperback, &quot;The Street of Crocodiles&quot;. A wonderful escape into the vanished world of pre WWII Galicia, Ukraine populated by Jews, Poles and Ukrainians - although Shultz's world is strictly   private, surrealist and fantastic, full of sounds and smells. Shultz's life was tragically cut short on a Drohobych street (city in Ukraine, where he lived), in 1942, when he was murdered by an SS officer.	2000-12-23

The Katyn massacre is a grim reminder of what the Soviet Union and its supporters and sympathizers were all about. Like the Great Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33, the Katyn Massacre has been kept hidden by the Soviet Union until its disintegration. Both are still not widely known - unlike the Jewish Holocaust. Far too little information has been brought to light on either subject. More needs to be done. &quot;Katyn&quot; is a must book for those who want to understand the brutality of the former Soviet Union.	2000-12-21
