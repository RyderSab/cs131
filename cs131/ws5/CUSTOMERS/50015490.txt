The author talks more about atrocities than the counter intelligence role that the organization played.  The only intelligence type stuff they discuss is the Ricard Sorge(Soviet Master Spy in Germanys Tokyo Embassy) capture and interogation.  The author does catelouge the atrocities committed by this organization well though(Hence the title Japan's dreaded military police).  The author explains the disgusting things that this organization did like make sex slaves out of Korean and other Western Women captured by them during the war, decapitating allied airmen, biological experiments on POW's, stuffing prisoners in Bambooe baskets and liteing them on fire.  He also explains the sickining fact that many in this organization went unpunished.	2003-02-04

The author does have much factual information in the book, but he paints Islam as a religion of nothing but extreamists(IN MY HUMBLE OPINION).  He grasps at straws in some parts of the book trying to link certain terrorist groups together.  He even suggests that it is likely that Al Queada and HIzbollah cells in South America will team up with Marxist groups like the Columbian FARRC and Neo Nazi groups to attack America.  While this is not impossible it is grasping at straws and when he talks about these (Marxist) groups in some detail it gets off track of the books intended subject matter(Fundmetalist Militant Islam).	2003-02-04

The author both underwrites and overestimates the possibility of Neo-Facist groups coming to power.  He is unobjective because he gives the opinion that these groups could be elected, therefore democracy is capable of hijacking itself, so he argues these political parties should be outlawed. He goes so far as to give the reader the impression that the whole nation of France is either Facist or ambivlient to Facism because the French police killed a suspected Algerian terrorist.  The author gives to many personal opinions rather than a to the point analysis of groups like the Austrian Freedom Party and the French National Front to make the book a true literary work documenting the rise of neo-facism in Europe.	2003-02-04

The book is good because it examines one of the figures who was instrumental in shapping the 20th century.  The author proves that he was very erratic with his forighn policy and his views on the world.  The author also disproves the misconception that it was his imperial ambitions that led to the first World War and points out that it was the militarism of prussian aristocrats.	2003-02-04

This plot was so much better thought out and more belivable  than the last two books plots.  The way mister Clancy keeps up on  international events and foriegn policy is remarkable.
