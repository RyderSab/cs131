However, I would agree with a few other reviewers that Eve's abrasiveness is getting trite.  Summerset has taken care of an injured Eve, has pushed Roarke to reconcile with her when they fight, and now he has taken on the care of a little girl for her.  And yet, Eve still treats him like dirt.  <br /> <br />I do like the fact that Robb relied more on storyline and plot instead of half-baked declarations of love between Eve and Roarke and/or sex scenes. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the story and the interactions that Roarke and Summerset had with Nixie, the nine year old witness that Even is protecting.  Eve's dealings with the child were less enjoyable, but she did soften a bit and I really enjoyed seeing that. <br /> <br />This is a great addition to the series.	2005-09-11

So, I was thrilled when I heard about this new book and the chance to find out a bit more about our favorite agent.  I wasn't disappointed! <br /> <br />I admit for much of the book I was doubting Pendergast, but in the end I felt vindicated!  We got to revisit a few of our past favorites-Smithback was here, as was Margo Green, the ever present and reliable D'Agosta, even Nora Kelly made appearances.  Jenny from Still Life with Crows made a brief appearance.  And that is what I loved about the book.  In many books that follow certain characters on to new chapters in their lives we often don't get to revisit the past, and who really lives like that?  The fact that Preston and Child brought back these wonderfully rick characters only adds to the ambience of the entire book, and that is one of the big draws to these books for me-the torrid atmosphere. <br /> <br />A true winner!	2005-08-03

I have read all of Sue Margolis' books, and while I enjoyed this one, it just wasn't as engaging as her other novels.  <br /> <br />In this book we find our heroine Cynthia Fishbein attending therapy because she just isn't able to stand up for herself.  Along the way, we meet her two best friends, Hugh and Harmony, we meet her many colorful work colleagues (as well as a frisky, foul-mouthed myna bird) and her loving family.  Interspaced between this, she falls in love has a crisis at work, then a crisis with her new love, then another crisis at work, and then....all is well. <br /> <br />Many people, myself included, want a happy ending with a romance novel, but I must say I just had a hard time getting into this book.  However, the characters were engaging, and I laughed out loud more than once. <br /> <br />Give this book a go-round, but look at Margolis' other books as well, especially Apocolipstick.  Very funny!	2005-07-31

Like the first novel in this series, Confessions of a Shopaholic, we find our lovable, but financially challenged Becky leaving England for, you guessed it...Manhattan.  And quite frankly, who wouldn't get in trouble in NYC.  Sample Sales, street vendors, flea markets (with actual stuff you would want to buy!) not to mention a shoppers paradise-Saks and Bloomies-Becky is in trouble. <br /> <br />Like the first book, a part of me just wants to reach into the pages and shake Becky, but then that wouldn't be fun.  Watching Becky work herself into a tizzy and then clam herself with a luscious buy, and then realize...oops...maybe I shouldn't have bought that is part of the fun. <br /> <br />Becky has some new friends this time-but we still get to visit with Suze and Luke.   <br /> <br />A rollicking good read, easily shines just as brightly as the first one.	2005-07-31

Now you know just by looking at the title of this book that our favorite shopaholic is going to be in heaven-what with the buying of the rings, choosing the flowers, the venue, not to mention the treat of all treats-buying the gown.  BUT we also know, this just wouldn't be Becky without some serious mishaps. <br /> <br />Like the pervious two novels this book is pure fun.  It is a joy to read Kinsella's take on the world of Becky Bloomwood.  In this installment we meet Eleanor, Luke's overbearing, emotionally-challenged mother.  We see her trying to take over Becky's time in the spotlight, and we see Becky growing a bit as a person while she learns to deal with her soon to be mother-in-law (monster-in-law?)  Frankly, I enjoyed seeing Becky acting with a bit more maturity while navigating the sometimes tricky task of planning a wedding and dealing with 'new' family members.  And seeing Becky growing up, only made her money escapades more endearing and funny to me. <br /> <br />I do hope that Kinsella continues to take Becky down this winding and wonderful path.	2005-07-31

You know, I admit that I did find myself getting annoyed with Becky, our heroine, and her way of spending and then not dealing with her problems, but then I realize that is only because Kinsella had managed to draw me into her world.  I empathized with Becky about wanting Prada's newest bag, but knowing I couldn't afford it and then buying it anyways.  (course, I not only have to find a way to pay for it, but to also justify the expense to my husband) I found myself wanting to tell her, \\"Just suck it up and learn to pay your bills!\\"  But then if she did that, we wouldn't have any more of these hilarious and fun books to read. <br /> <br />Kinsella writes with a warmth and a wit that many authors, hint at but never quite hit.  If you are looking for a light, but hilarious read, look no further.	2005-07-16

It doesn't requite deep thought or a list of notes to follow along, (which is exactly what I want in a book that I am taking to the beach) I laughed out loud and I cheered for our heroine when she landed her man. <br /> <br />The book follows the standard chick-lit plot.  Boy and Girl meet, fall for one another, someone does something wrong, then they find their way back to one another.  I must say this book offered a new transgression, one that I found myself hurting alongside our heroine as she suffered the indignities of her partner. <br /> <br />This was my first book by Kinsella, but it certainly won't be my last.	2005-07-13

I have all her books, and I must say that I like this one the best.  I am a fan of her 'diet' philosophy-that is she doesn't have one.  I am not a big fan of restrictive diets.  I can't see depriving my body of a certain group of foods in the belief that it is going to be good for my body.  That is why I was so excited for Ray's new book. <br /> <br />There are so many delicious and sensible meals in here where do you even begin:  The Swedish Meatballs and noodles were a huge hit with my boys!  They love meatballs and hey who doesn't, and we all love pasta, so this was a nice way to eat the two together, as opposed to just spaghetti and meatballs.  My favorite is probably the Cream of Cheddar Soup and Lime Chicken Avocado salad.  And for the first time, Ray includes a dessert chapter.  We have only made one recipe-Mascarpone Parfait with Citrus Fruit- but it was delicious. <br /> <br />I just can't say enough about this book.  It is her longest book yet, coming in at just over 240 pages and it is jam packed with yummy and simple recipes that use lots of fresh foods as well as convenience foods when time is a factor (and let's face it...when is time NOT a factor!)  Great book-highly recommend adding it to your collection.	2005-04-28
US	42643917	R3BFXYUWI09GSR	084991180X	723070327	Monster	Books	4	21	24	N	N	A very good read	I must say first...I am not necessarily a fan of Christian fiction.  Nothing against it, just not something I read.  So when I picked this book up, and then got home I was a tad wary to find that Peretti is somewhat known for jsut that.  But I was surprised.  I didn't find that book waxing poetic about the evils of evolution or being completely against the theory itself.   <br /> <br />One of the supporting characters Mike Capella, is/was a biologist who was against the theory of evolution.  (Unless, I read it wrong) but more importantly he was against tampering with what is already here.  And I beleive that was the heart of the book.  I do think that FP has his own beliefs inserted in the book, and why not, he is the author, and he makes a compelling argument.  <br /> <br />I must say that the monster in the book isn't the real monster here, but then I suppose that was the point.  The book can get a little wordy, but I enjoyed the premise of the book very much.  <br /> <br />A few, even the author himself, sited Crichton as an inspiration, ok, but I must say I find Peretti's writing style simply and that isn't a bad thing here.  Crichton can be a bit verbose, almost like he is trying to make a deep, thought provoking book when all you want to read about is the monster.  For the most part Peretti did just that, and in a book like this, that is what I want.	2005-04-20

The only problem I had with this book is Laura's story seems to be incomplete.  By that I mean, the other two girls, Margo and Kate, came before her, so in the later stories NR would lend glimpses into their lives.  Margo and her true love and doing this, or Kate and her new love are going to do this.  Since Laura is the final story we don't get that little extr bit of fun!  Maybe Roberts will write about their children though.<br /><br />This was a great light read.  The romance was plausible and the characters were realistic, something many romance books don't give us.<br /><br />I am a big fan of these trilogies that Roberts writes and it was nice to get all three books in one here.  In the past, I will buy one book, find out it is part of a series and THEN find out the other books won't come out for months.  I hate waiting!<br /><br />If you are a romance fan than I certainly recommend this book.	2005-04-18

I have watched a number of her shows on Food Network, and the shows I have seen all have recipes that seem a tad fussy and over done.  But the book had a number of recipes that were simple to make and had the clean, simple taste my husband and children enjoy.  <br /> <br />I love to cook, and I love cookbooks.  I am always trying new things, or trying old things in new ways.  Sometimes my family enjoys it, sometimes they just give me a look and eat a few bites to be nice.  This cookbook takes me back to the down home southern cooking my husband knows and loves. <br /> <br />The beer in the rear chicken was easy to prepare, and I really liked the flavor the beer infused into the chicken.  There is a warm chicken salad casserole that my kids just gobbled up. <br /> <br />The food isn't 'low fat' by any means.  But on the weekend, when my husband, our four little boys and I are just hanging out, I really want something rich and satisfying-and this book delivers.	2005-04-02

The book is an 'ok' addition to the series; something about it just lacked the zing that the other books seemed to have. <br /> <br />I am one of those readers that finds Eve's past abuse somewhat tiring.  Roberts finds a way to tie it into every single case Eve works on.  And I know a few cops, and I know that occasionally they will use civilian 'experts', but somehow Eve gets her husband in on EVERY single one of her cases.  Plausibility aside, the storyline was good, my big beef with the book is it just wrapped it up too darn quick.  One chapter they are struggling for answers, the next chapter they suddenly got the guy?  Roberts could easily have added another 50 or even 100 pages and worked through the story a bit better, and not lost any of reader's interest. <br /> <br />I will continue to read the \\"In Death\\" books and I look forward to hopefully seeing Eve grow a bit more, or continue to grow I should say.	2005-04-02

I will say that the only beef I had with it is there are no pictures!  Like I said in another review I did on a cookbook, many people are visual creatures, especially my four little boys.  They like to SEE what they are about to eat, and with this cookbook I can't do that.  That said....I learned to get over that! <br /> <br />I have made a number of recipes from this book, and ALL were hits not only with the boys, but with my husband and I as well.  I highly recommend trying the Chicken Picatta...wonderful flavor and a cinch to make.  The Jamaican Macaroni was a nice take on the old standby of Mac and Cheese, the kids liked the flavor and I got some vegetables into them as well. <br /> <br />The recipes are indeed quick, although for some I think the author's boost of 20 minutes is pushing it, but so what.  I made the Chicken Picatta last night with a fettucine side and some corn, along with a salad, and it took me about 35 minutes to get it all on the table-start to finish.  35 minutes works for me! <br /> <br />For the price...you just can't go wrong with this one.	2005-03-15

The book really is very witty and oftentimes insightful, but at the same time it gets tiresome to hear Alley continously wax romantic about her huge [...]!  She is so much more than that, and while I think it took a tremendous amount of courage for her to just come out and say, \\"Hey, I am fat, now I am going to do something about it!\\" She need not forget that her being a smart, funny and beautifully vivacious woman, not to mention a true comedic talent has nothing to do with the size of her posterior.	2005-03-15

I collect cookbooks, and am a big fan of a number of the food network 'stars'  I have all of Rachael Ray's books, a few of Emeril, Bobby Flay's, so when I saw this one was coming out I started watching the show.  I enjoyed the show, Giada is a likeable character and it is fun to see the recipes come to life under her able hand.  <br /> <br />Which is what I didn't necessarily like about the book.  I like to see the finished product.  Especially since all the recipes are Italian, it is tough to gauge how they might look and taste.  Now, I can read the ingredient list, sure no problem, but I am also the mother of four little boys....two of whom are picky eaters.  Those of you will little boys now, they are visual creatures it helps to show them what Mommy is making.  Granted my oldest thinks Giada is very pretty...he was still wondering what dinner was going to look like. <br /> <br />I have made a number of the recipes...last night we had the penna cotta for dessert, and it was wonderful!  I enjoy the book.  In my collection of over 50 cookbooks, I only had one Italian cookbook...this one will be replacing my old one.  I didn't find any of the 10 or so recipes I have made overly hard or complicated.  Of the recipes I have chosen, none required exotic ingredients you aren't likely to use again.  Great book, and a fun addition.	2005-03-08

The down side is, it was over just too quickly.  Things were wrapped up so fast and so neatly, it was almost a let down.  But it was still a blast to read. <br /> <br />I consider something like this a fun read.  It isn't going to tax your brain, or even make ya think a whole lot.  But you will be entertained.  I like Reilly's books about Shane Schofield better (Ice Station, Area 7, and Scarecrow, but this books doesn't deviate from a formula that is working for Reilly. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a non stop action novel, I highly recommend this one.	2005-03-05

Cerulean Sins isn't a bad book, mind you, but it doesn't have the engaging plot or characters that the earlier books in the series have. <br /> <br />I find it amusing that the person that seems to really like this book has only read three books in the series, that would leave 7 books from which to compare this one too.  I know, I know...this is its own seperate work, that said, it is part of a series and you would think it would follow suit. <br /> <br />Anita's powers are continuing to grow, great...tell us why?  All men seem to want her....ok, again, why?  Then there is the fiasco LKH made of Dolph...why? <br /> <br />I admit that I will read Incubus Dreams, but at this point it is only because I am anal and want to read the entire series.

While certainly not the weakest book in the series (I have read them in order and am finishing up Cerulean Sins) it isn't my favorite. <br /> <br />Things are just resolved too quickly.  I wish LKH would spend less time building up the less than satisfactory sex scenes and spend more time on Anita's inner turmoil as she grapples to come to terms with what she is becoming.  (On the other hand, noone really seems to know what she is becoming so maybe that is a moot point.)  <br /> <br />The previous book had a scene I found so distasteful I almost returned the rest of the books in the series, but I decided to give it another go.  No nasty little hospital scenes in this book (If you read Obsidian Butterfly you know what I am talking about) and there is the introduction of a new love interest for Anita, one I find infinetely more interesting than whiny ole' Richard. <br /> <br />What I found most interesting what the 'big, bad guy' but alas Hamilton just didn't give him enough page time.  The idea and what he was was very interesting, but again like Bloody Bones, he seemed almost an afterthought. <br /> <br />Less sex....more turmoil please.	2005-01-28

Anita is in the hospital guarding some of the 'victims' when one gets loose and enters the hospital's nursery.  Now, I would have found the scene MUCH more suspenseful if Anita is battling it out while trying to protect the babies, but LKH takes some of them out of the equation in a most distasteful manner.  One I found almost offensive.  It wasn't needed and I wish it wasn't in the book. <br /> <br />Like a few others I chalk that up to poor editing.  If the book had been thoroughly looked over, one hopes a good editor would have pointed out the offensive nature of the scene. <br /> <br />I do disagree about the introduction of the bad guy, you knew all along it wasn't who you thought it was, and LKH had enough nuances in the book that the baddie was kept on the front-burner.   <br /> <br />Not the strongest in the series, but it had its moments.  I really liked getting to know Edward, and I especially liked the introduction of Olaf's character.  I hope that he revisits Anita in a later book.  Bernardo was another tempting character, and I hope he also resurfaces. <br /> <br />Truthfully, the only reason I gave this particular book three stars, was that one particular chapter.  I just found the way it was handled offensive for some reason, and I don't think it was needed.  It put a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the book.	2005-01-20

Want to know why I didn't give it five stars?  CAuse it is too short in my book!  I love Rachel Ray.  I enoy her shows on Food Network, and I have all her books...she is just...well, fun.  I just want her to come out with a big ole honkin' book like Gourmet did.  <br /> <br />Anyways, this is a fun book.  What I enjoy most is that all of her recipes are designed to be short so most of them kids can help out with in some way.  I have her Kids book (a great addition by the way) and my kids enjoy the recipes so much that they bought me this book for Christmas.  My oldest son and I (he is almost 11) have made a number of the menus from this book already. The recipes are easy to follow, none of the ingredients are too exotic, and the results and quick and delicious.  We particularly enjoy her 'scrambles' My five year old loves scrambled eggs, and this is a great way for me to sneak some veggies or new ingredients in on him. <br /> <br />All in all, I definetely recommend this book.  There is no index, but so what!  The book is spelled out pretty cleanly in the Table of Contents, and part of the fun of a cookbook is flipping through it and getting new ideas.	2005-01-12

I enjoyed this book, don't get me wrong; but what I didn't like was that much of it seemed forced.  Strange for a book don't you think?  I mean what is a book, but the author's words, and yet many of the scenes still seemed forced.  In the first six or so entries of the book, much was made of Anita's self-imposed chastity, and here she is almost doing peep-shows!  I understand wanting to add the element of erotic undertones, hey, I am all for it...but at the same time shouldn't you have your lead character be a little more true to form?  I mean after all you did write her that way. <br /> <br />That is my one big complaint with this book.  I enjoyed Anita getting away from her usual setting, and I also enjoyed learning more about her were-leopard pack and seeing them in action.  I especially enjoyed the characters of Jason and Jamil.  <br /> <br />There was a lot to digest in this book, but it flowed together rather nicely, I just wish LKH would spend more time on the story and less time setting up the 'love scenes.' Some drag on for ten or more pages, and in the end it basically just amounts to kissing a groping, keep them short and sweet and give us more story!!!	2005-01-12

The ending of this one was much more satisfying than the previous novel.  Although, I must say that at times, Richard got on my nerves, I was glad to see some sort of agreement met with Jean Claude and Anita. <br /> <br />The introduction of the council was a great addition, although the atrocities hinted at make me hope that LKH explores the council members' pasts a bit more in a future novel. <br /> <br />It definetely helps to read the previous books, as while the books can stand along not all the background information is revisited.  <br /> <br />The new character of Asher has intrigued me, and I must admit Yvette does as well.

The only real problem I had with this book, is how quickly Anita resolved her feelings.  The first five books had her so conflicted about her feelings regarding monsters, that her reconciliation of them was rather quick. <br /> <br />But I enjoyed this book, as I have the first five.  Anita, isn't like you and I, she has abilities of her own, and this book explores that.  I was never a huge fan of Richard, so I am glad that his true colors are starting to show.  Marcus always struck me as weak, so again, I am glad his character got his come-uppance.  I do not think we have seen the last of Raina, and while she got on my nerves in this book, you can't deny that she is a good villian. <br /> <br />This is one series that I do think it really helps to start at the beginning.  If you are looking for a fun read, this series will NOT disappoint.	2004-12-28

You know, I always thought it was RAWHIDE and Bloody Bones.... <br /> <br />Great installment!  I gave it four instead of five because the 'main baddie' (he is in the title after all!) seemed to be an afterthought near the end.  I enjoyed getting to know a little bit about fairies, I hope that they are in future installments.  And like a number of other reviewers, I liked the fact that Larry was in the story.  I almost enjoyed reading more about Anita's relationship with him, than I did her relationship with Jean Claude.  I liked the character of Jason as well, thought he didn't get to change in this book. <br /> <br />LKH hinted that Larry has \\"an aura' all his own, and I am anxiously awaiting the results of that statement.   <br /> <br />All in all, out of the five books I have read so far, I enjoyed this one the most.  The characters were well fleshed out, and it was just fun.   <br /> <br />CAn't wait to see what The Killing Dance has in store for me!	2004-12-24

I have read the first three books in the series, and like someone said earlier, I think this is where the story starts to pick up. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book, no doubt about it, but there are a few things that I saw as 'not fitting' with the description of Anita that Hamiliton is trying so hard to push on us.  Someone else mentioned her giving into a proposal by Jean Claude, the way it is written just doesn't mesh with the attitude Anita tries so hard to convey.  And the ending is a little too pat, I mean how exactly does she figure out who the 'bad guy' really is?  Is she psychic and I missed it? <br /> <br />Despite any issues I may have had with the book, there is no doubt in my mind I am going to read the rest of the series.  This was a fun installment, and I can't wait to see what happens next.	2004-12-21

I tend to read action, adventure or mysteries.  I look to romance because I want something fun, wild and finished!  Call me dull, but I like an ending where the two main characters get together, and although in the end that sort of happened, it wasn't what you would expect.  I enjoyed the story, up until the last 40 or 50 pages, then things seemed to just move along way to fast.  Why take the time to create characters and explore lives if you are just going to warp them up so quickly? <br /> <br />Someone also mentioned, A Knight in Shining Armor.  I would also like to see some sort of conclusion there.  Just like in this series, it would be nice to see some kind of follow up that shows what happens to Adam and Darci.  All in all, I was disappointed with the ending, but I admit that I will stick around to see what Devereux comes up with next.	2004-12-14

This is a great addition, however I must say the rhapsodizing that Eve and Roarke do seems just, well silly.... <br /> <br />These characters love each other, that much we know.  We know the depth of their love for one another, but there are more than a few spots in the book where Eve just seems to break character so that she can wax romantic about her handsome husband. <br /> <br />Roarke's gushing over his wife is a little more believable, but what I find trite is at the start of every single one of these little episodes the characters have to rehash their bad childhoods.  Did they forget since the last time they went over it?  Have the details changed?  No, I would just love to see Robb move these characters past their 'revalations' about their childhoods and let them move on to a different area of their relationship.	2004-11-29

I am new to the series, and like some other fans I read the first three books in about a week.  That said, I don't think the storylines really get fleshed out until the third installment or so, so keep reading the books. <br /> <br />Guilty Pleasures was just that...a guilty pleasure!  It is a quick read, with limited character development, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The fact that Hamilton didn't spend too much time fleshing out her central characters leaves you wanting more, rather than feeling deflated. <br /> <br />The fact that Hamilton made her 'big bad Master' something unique is what struck me the quickest in the book.  Rather than going with the pat, big, bad guy...Hamilton seemed to have put some thought into who the Master should be, and the fact that it is so unexpected is what drew me into the story. <br /> <br />A very fun read....I need to get back to book four now...	2004-11-10

I have read the first three books in the series, and I am working on the fourth.  That said, I am starting to think that the first two books are almost introductions to the real meat of the series.  Book three is much more plot driven than the first two, but that isn't a bad thing. <br /> <br />The Laughing Corpse has more than a few twists and turns, although while none is particularly unique they are certainly interesting.  What I enjoyed the most was Anita's interaction with Jean Claude, the Master of the City.  There were a few minor characters that were well written as well, most notably Wanda, a handicapped prostitute that figures prominantly in Anita's triumph at the end of the book. <br /> <br />A solid second novel in the series.	2004-11-10

My kids love this book, and my husband loves the results.  I have four little boys, 10, 8, 5 and seven months.  Obviously the baby is too young to help out just yet, but the older three couldn't wait to get home and pick out a recipe from the respective chapters in the book.  ( 4-6, 7-11 and 12 and up)  They have each made a meal from the book and we not only had a healthy and tasty meal to eat, but we had a blast making it.   <br /> <br />We also have Emeril's books and a few Cooking with Mickey books.  In Emeril's books the one thing I have noticed is the amount of time it can take to make some of the recipes.  On a Saturday, I would think nothing of preparing a four course meal that takes three or four hours, but my kids don't have the patience for that yet.  The Mickey books, although they are some of my favorites, are rather complex.  Rachel Ray's book is simple and yet fun for the beginning cook.  The results while not immediate, are tasty and don't require a lot of patience to reproduce. <br /> <br />If you have kids and they show ANY interest at all in cooking or just helping you out...I highly recommend this book.	2004-11-05

I was intrigued enough to buy this book when I read the many glowing reviews.  However, after reading it two things spring to mind: <br /> <br />1) Jameson is smarter than many people give her credit for. <br />2) Either she has had the most trying life I know of, or she is a capable embellisher. <br /> <br />Most of the 'stories' in this book have the ring ot some truth in them, but I can't help but think that the details have been exagerrated.  Come on...her father sat around and did drugs with them, only to then say that the best drug is crank?  Her father single-handedly shot over 60 Viet Cong?  She was kidnapped by the local mafia while her father was a cop? <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book...but I suggest you take it with a LARGE grain of salt.	2004-10-10

It was a quick lighthearted beach read, and while predictable it did have it's moments.  I laughed, and even though I kind of figured the way the book would end up, I was happy when our heroine found what she wanted.  I think I will give another of the author's books a shot.	2004-09-14

It was just...blah, for lack of a better word.  They characters seemed almost pat or cliche', there was nothing to make them memorable or unique.  I think I will wait for the new Alex Cross novel.	2004-09-11

Shane Schofield is a man's man (and no, I am not a man) He is a modern Indiana Jones.  Dark, brooding, mysterious and sexy.  And wouldn't you know it, Reilly had another one in him.  Aloyius Knight, The Black Knight, is Schofield with a sharper edge, and the two characters are fabulous together!  There is one plot twist, I didn't see coming, and although I was disappointed at the demise of one central character, it works with the tone of the book.  I highly recommeded this book.	2004-07-14

First let me say that Lady Kensington has a much smaller role than I was lead to believe after reading the synopsis. Aside from that, this is a fun read. I have read all of Rollins' previous books and this is one of his best! The plot was fast moving and you don't get confused as to how the characters relate to one another. The ending was a little obvious, which is why I didn't give it five stars, but if you like adventure novels (and I most certainly do!) you will enjoy &quot;Sandstorm.&quot;	2004-07-12
