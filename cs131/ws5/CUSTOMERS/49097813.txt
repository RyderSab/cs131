This innovative to poverty will create opportunities for the poor by offering them choices and encouraging self-esteem.<br /><br />Illustrating his message with a wealth of case studies, Prahalad demonstrates how this can be done profitably by:<br /><br />* Challenging your assumptions about bottom of the pyramid markets.<br /><br />* Unlocking what he calls the \\"poverty penalty.\\"<br /><br />* Delivering dignity, enablement and choice rather than just products.<br /><br /> The author argues persuasively that with the private sector leading this change will result in real strides in job creation and services for the poor rather than rhetorical flourishes.	2005-10-11

Citing case studies and practical advice, he argues unlimited opportunities for profitable business growth will find those companies that apply innovative technology and solutions to the world's social and environmental problems.<br /><br />The management professor at Cornell's Johnson Graduate School of Management, argues \\"one-size-fits-all\\" \\"command and control\\" approaches to production and supply are done.

Companies poured their resources into serving the 14 per cent of the world's population that is fortunate enough to live there.<br /><br />According to the authors, Vijay Mahajan, former dean of the Indian School of Business and current holder of the Harbin Centennial Chair in Business at the university of Texas in Austin and Kamini Banga, an independent marketing consultant, these markets are over-saturated, over-competitive and aging.<br /><br />The growth, they argue, lies in reaching the rest of the world.  Focusing on the 86 percent of the world with a per capital gross national product of less than $10,000 year offers a rich opportunity.  These markets have been largely invisible to worldwide companies and even some firms operating there.  Yes, the authors acknowledge, these countries lack infrastructure and media.  They have low literacy rates.  Their consumers react in unconventional ways.<br /><br />Yet with the right solutions, these markets represent staggering opportunities.  The authors suggest realizing that potential by:<br /><br />1. Reaching middle class and the affluent consumers along with the poor.  These markets are larger, wealthier and more diverse than you realize.<br /><br />2. Designing products that reflect local environments and cultures.<br /><br />3. Using expatriates to ricochet your products into the local economy.<br /><br />4. Growth big by thinking small.<br /><br />5. Bringing your own infrastructure with you.<br /><br />6. Take the market to the people.<br /><br />To illustrate these strategies, the authors draw on dozens of emerging market examples. They offer actionable strategies and tactics for product design, pricing, packaging, distribution and advertising.<br /><br />Emerging markets are different.  Yet, worldwide companies are already reaping billions of dollars in sales from them.	2005-10-07

In short, they seek to<br /><br />1. Preserve spending power after both inflation and taxes.<br /><br />2. Seek to avoid unacceptable market, liquidity and diversification risks.<br /><br />3. Protect profits without loss of invested positions.<br /><br /> If you fit this investment profile, then Michel C. Thomsett has written this book for you.  In it he demonstrates how carefully selected options strategies can help you consistently improve your returns without adding additional portfolio risk.  Options, he argues, do not have to be exotic, high risk or complicated.  In fact, they can be employed as a powerful tool to reduce risk.<br /><br />He wisely sets his ground rules early in the book.  They are:<br /><br />1. Limit options activity to stocks you have pre-qualified.<br /><br />2. Have faith the market with rise over time.<br /><br />3. Accept the value of fundamental analysis.<br /><br />4. If trade down, be prepared to add to your position.<br /><br />5. Believe there are an adequate number of stocks which will meet your investment standards.<br /><br />Thomsett's book is well-written and illustrated - even if you are not familiar with options.  In 255 pages he covers options strategies suitable for conservative investors.  He includes covered call writing, contingent purchase strategies, rescue strategies to use when markets fall and combination strategies that produce cash to bolster current income.<br /><br />If conservative and moderate investors remain true to their goals, options are a wonderful tool.  However, Thomsett is experienced enough to acknowledge that deep in the heart of every market hedger is a speculator eager to spread his or her wings.<br /><br />Stick with the author's ground rules and you will avoid the market's playground of temptations./>	2005-09-06

Along the way, I have read many books on trading.  This is, perhaps, one of the best.

Add to that, the growing list of investors and consumers who limit their purchases to companies that match the buyer's personal standards.<br /><br />Without a clear moral beacon, an organization risks devastating financial failure.  The authors argue that without moral intelligence, long-term business success is not sustainable.<br /><br />For years we have recognized the difference between cognitive and emotional intelligence.  Moral Intelligence, the authors argue is another distinct division.  They define it as the ability to determine how universal human principles - like the \\"golden rule\\" - should be applied to our personal values, goals and actions.<br /><br />The book focuses on four principles that are vital for sustained personal and organizational success:<br /><br />1. Integrity<br /><br />2. Responsibility<br /><br />3. Compassion<br /><br />4. Forgiveness<br /><br />The authors admit that emotional and moral intelligence comes into play when more decisions are at stake.  Yet it is obvious that there is a boundary.  Without a moral anchor, leaders can be charismatic and influential, but in a profound destructive manner.<br /><br />Doug Lennick and Fred Kiel draw on extensive original research to demonstrate the best performing companies have leaders with a strong moral compass.  Their ability to never waiver pays even in a world that often rewards bad behavior in the short run.	2005-08-16

Two months later, Theo Epstein, the team's general manager, opted not to met a $50 million dollar offer from Omar Minaya, the new general manager of the New York Mets to star pitcher Pedro Martinez, considered by many to be the heart and sole of his team.<br /><br />Mets fans were ecstatic; Red Sox fans expressed mixed emotions.  Martinez's skills clearly had begun to erode; yet it would be next to impossible to replace his battling determination.<br /><br />It will be years before anyone can clearly assess which general manager made the correct decision.<br /><br />Michael Roberto, a Harvard Business School faculty member, in this insightful book argues Minaya and Epstein are not alone.  In all types of organizations, leaders often have to wait long time periods to see the results of their decisions.  The core premise of his book is that a quality process enhances the probability of achieving a positive outcome.<br /><br />A quality process, according to the author involves more than sound analytics.  It involves the astute management of the emotional, political and social aspects of decision making.  To wit:<br /><br />* Have you considered multiple alternatives?<br /><br />* Have you surfaced and tested your assumptions?<br /><br />* Did dissenting views emerge during your deliberations?<br /><br />* Are you building high levels of commitment and shared understanding?<br /><br />Roberto argues and then demonstrates how leaders cultivate constructive conflict to enhance critical and divergent thinking.  This means managing the tension between conflict and consensus.  Secondly, he argues leaders need to spend time \\"deciding how to decide.\\"  High-quality processes require forethought.  Ensure your desire for a solution to a critical and complex problem employs more than a single-minded solution.  Time spent \\"deciding how to decide\\" will increase the possibility of walking the fine line between conflict and consensus.<br /><br />As for the Mets and the Red Sox, my vote goes with Theo Epstein.

Let me caution, finishing the course will not make me a Greek master.  Rather, Mounce teaches enough Greek to enhance my study of the Bible.<br /><br />The book is more, however.

This makes it ideal for the type of self-study I am attempting.  Another study aid is the CD-ROM, which comes with the book.  Each week's lesson is reinforced by a lecture, complete with slides, delivered by William Mounce to a group of lay-people attempting to do what I have undertaken.<br /><br />If you have a desire to learn Greek, but do not have the time or the fortitude to undertake an academic approach to language, this is the book for you.

Respond with the traditional marketing push and pull.  In other words, increase pull by upping your advertising budget.  Increase your push by employing price and promotional policies.  These have been the mainstay of marketing for more than 50 years.<br /><br />2. Strengthen your customer relationships.  In recent years companies have refocused on their customers by emphasizing customer satisfaction metrics, staying on message, building better products using TQM and emphasizing more personal service.<br /><br />3. The final option is to advocate for your customer.  This means you give your customers and prospects complete, open and honest information so they can find the product which best serves their needs.  This is a dialogue.  The goal with this option is to have customers reciprocate with their trust, purchases and loyalty.<br /><br />Although it may require a complete cultural marketing make-over, Urban says the benefits of advocacy are worth the investment:<br /><br />1. Reduced customer acquisition costs.  Trust lowers the number of new customers company must acquire to maintain its growth projection.<br /><br />2. Higher Profit margins.  Customers are willing to pay more for quality products from vendors they trust.<br /><br />3. Growth.  When a company becomes a trust vendor, customers look to that firm for more products and services in more categories.<br /><br />4. Advocacy lays the foundation for long-term customer advantage.<br /><br />Not only is Urban's thesis persuasive, he also shows how to determine whether an advocacy-based strategy is right for your firm.

The book details three years and more than 30 letters which resulted in Edward Boyd decision to accept Christ.<br /><br />During his journey, he and his son hash through such topics as why the world is so full of suffering; why God needs prayer; how you can believe someone rose from the dead; and how another man's death pardons others.<br /><br />Not that his son, Dr. Gregory Boyd, a professor of theology at Bethel College in St. Paul, MN, was all that convincing.  Too often, the apologetics professor restructured or rephrased his father's legitimate arguments and doubts to ones premised on the acceptance of the faith.  This technique is far more effective with believers who have already made the leap of faith and are looking for a rational justification for their decision than a true skeptic.<br /><br />Despite the letter's brutal honesty, both men exhibit respect and love toward one another as they address these volatile subjects.  There is never a doubt that the son is persistent and determined.  During the three year long correspondence, Greg reveals he is training for a 100 kilometer running road race championship.  In it, he finished as the seventh American and 23rd overall.<br /><br />My only issue with the book lies in its effectiveness at persuading a skeptic without as dedicated a mentor as Greg to make the leap.

Otherwise, I would have never picked up Eric Prentis' The Astute Investor.  Remembering all those dedicated teachers, I managed to overlook the photograph of the author dressed in a tuxedo on the cover and delve into what I discovered is a great investment guide.<br /><br />Prentis has collected wisdom from 37 investment classics and distills it into seven principles:<br /><br />1. Investors should understand the nature of investing.<br /><br />2. A securities purchase is an interest in or a claim on the company's future earning streams.<br /><br />3. Understand and have confidence in your investment decisions.<br /><br />4. Analysis and calculation are the cornerstones of successful investing.<br /><br />5. Have the courage of your convictions.<br /><br />6. Limit your ambitions to your competence.<br /><br />7. Successful results from judgment, not mathematical formulas or clear-cut facts.<br /><br />Prentis draws on fundamental and technical data, described clearly and concisely, to equip today's investor with the knowledge and resources to achieve their investing goals.<br /><br />Time spent with this book will help any investor de-mystify today's often mystifying markets.	2005-06-21

Thankfully, my wife is a fan.  Otherwise I would have missed this opportunity to spend time with my favorite author - William Faulkner.<br /><br />I was introduced to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County while I was in college.  Back then I was asked to read The Sound and the Fury.  I will admit I was more than a little confused with what I was later to learn was Faulkner's hallmark shifting of the narration from one character to another; his disorienting disruptions of a timely chronology.<br /><br />As I read more, I began to appreciate the genius behind the technique.  It was like my days as a newspaper reporter.  Each witness to a story had his or her version of what had happened.  The more I dug, the more likely I was to emerge with a story that resembled the true event.<br /><br />While Faulkner's narration and characters appear complex, his themes are simple.  He writes about life's great issues - life and death, good and evil, love and hate, wealth and poverty, individual and family, sanity and insanity, success and failure.<br /><br />Faulkner's characters speak to their ability to transcend their settings and endure their sufferings.  They emerge pained, yet ennobled.<br /><br />Although I am not fond of the heat and humidity, I am looking forward to spending a portion of my summer's reading time in the Mississippi hill country of Yoknapatawpha County.	2005-06-20

Yet The Hot Kid is classic Elmore Leonard.  Unforgettable characters, engaging dialogue and crisp pacing mark the author's fortieth novel.<br /><br />Grounded in gangsters and gun molls of the past, this is an historical novel.  It is less funny than his previous novels.  Yet it is still a great summer read.  There is not much of a plot.<br /><br />It recounts the adventures of Federal Marshall Carl Webster - the \\"Hot Kid\\" of the title. When a gangster steals his ice cream cone at the age of fifteen, Carl becomes a lawman. Good-looking, with a flair for publicity, he is an outlaw's worst nightmare.<br /><br />The Hot Kid may be different, but it hard to put down.  A reader cannot expect more than that from Elmore Leonard.	2005-06-03

Each indicator is evaluated using the following criteria:<br /><br />* Why is it important?<br /><br />* How is it computed?<br /><br />* What does it day about the future?<br /><br />* How might stocks, bonds and/or currencies react to its announcement?<br /><br />In Chapter 4, he examines the 10 most influential foreign indicators using the same criteria.<br /><br />In the final two chapters, Baumohl provides a list of web sites that compile economic data.

This book certainly does that.  A Master Sergeant, a lieutenant with little in common except a mutual concern about a twice-wounded marine who they suspect who went-over-the-hill during a nighttime fire fight one night in Vietnam.<br /><br />With help from a former Viet Cong soldier and small-town newspaper editor 28 years later they return to the former war zone to attempt to uncover the truth about what happened to the young soldier.<br /><br />The story is compelling.  However, this book reveals more.  From within in its pages emerges an understanding of what it means to be human.<br /><br />Purple Sun should not be missed.  It is a story that will stay with you for years to come.	2005-05-10

The author makes a compelling case that in today's complex and chaotic environment, it is essential to solve what increasingly seems like the unsolvable.<br /><br />The author, an emeritus USC professor of management, breaks his treatment of creativity into four parts:<br /><br />1. Learning to harness your creative intelligence.<br /><br />2. Exploring opportunities to apply your creativity.<br /><br />3. Helping others recognize and use their creativity.<br /><br />4.

Along the way millions of individual investors made and lost billions as they were skewered in the intoxicating tale.  Gasparino, to his credit, tells the tale well.  His research and interviews, largely compiled while a Wall Street Journal reporter assigned to the story, bring fresh insights to this age-old tale of greed, arrogance and street-business-as-usual.<br /><br />His access to dispositions, e-mail exchanges and documents help the reader capture the out-of-control personalities of the characters involved in this tale.<br /><br />If you invest with the idea that your broker is your best friend, you need to read this book.  Greed is Wall Street's only constant and the markets and brokerage firms are there only to take your money away.<br /><br />If that is cynicism, so be it.

In bed with a temperature approaching 103, unable to decide if I was going to freeze or sweat to death, I was up to the early hours racing to the book's conclusion.<br /><br />It is a riveting story.  Finder is a great story teller.  This may be his best-book-to-date.  It is a compelling tale, carried by complex and life-like characters.<br /><br />The story is fairly simple.  The company man, Nick Conover, finds his world is collapsing.  His wife recently died accidentally.  He has been forced to lay-off 5,000 employees in his home town, earning him the nickname \\"The Slasher.\\"  He is being stalked by someone who brutally murders his family's pet dog.<br /><br />I did not care for the book's conclusion.  The author tells me he vetted it with a district attorney.  I believe the author, but would not vote for the vetting district attorney.<br /><br />These thematic disagreements beg the main issue, however.  The ability to hold my attention while being as sick as I was unquestionably qualifies Finder as one of this country's greatest writers of thrillers.  I will be eagerly looking forward to his next novel.	2005-04-07

Following Vietnam and Watergate, the country was adrift, unsure of its foreign and domestic mandate.  Between 1975 and 1979 Reagan delivered more than 1,000 radio addresses, of which he himself wrote 680.<br /><br />Reagan argued in vain against the Panama Canal treaties.  He was against the prevailing view that the Vietnam War was wrong.  He counseled against d&eacute;tente with the Soviet Union; against the growth of regulation; and against the tax burden.<br /><br />Yet he was fundamentally an optimist.  His positive positive, values-based prescriptions for the economy and for Soviet relations were welcome prescriptions during this period of what President Jimmy Carter termed \\"malaise.\\"  Reagan told inspiring stories; he applauded charities and small businesses that worked to overcome challenges.<br /><br />In short, he touched voters.  This history of Reason's pre-presidential thoughts provides unique insights not just into Reagan's policy thinking, but also into his status as a master communicator.	2005-03-29

Drawing on access to Michael Eisner and Roy Disney, the author offers a rare look inside the normally secretive world of the corporate boardroom.<br /><br />It is an engrossing tale of one of the world's most powerful media and entertainment companies and those who own it.<br /><br />But alas, I worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert during the period the author wrote about in one of his previous ventures.  In that book, Den of Thieves, it was obvious that Stewart had no access to the main character and the result was an unbalanced story.  Though successful at the book stores, it did one of our country's most ingenious financial minds a disservice.  The Drexel Burnham that emerged from Stewart's agenda-driven portrait was not the Drexel Burnham I knew and experienced daily for almost six years.<br /><br />DisneyWar is the story of a corporate tragedy.  It contains unsuspected twists, larger-than-life characters and a predictable, yet exciting, climax.  Well-written, it often reads like a page-turning novel.<br /><br />Yet, I am left wondering.  What did the author omit?  What important character denied him access?  It is too bad.  DisneyWar is a great story.  Too bad I cannot trust the author to tell in a fair, balanced and accurate manner.	2005-03-29

He would confide to the mark that he intended to invest the bundle in a sure fire business deal.  He offered to invest the mark's cash in the same deal if he would demonstrate confidence in the deal by pleading his money and gold watch.  Thompson promised to return the next day with the watch and even more cash.<br /><br />Of course, he never did.<br /><br />Throughout history, Americans have held ambivalent views of Wall Street.  One moment they see it as one huge casino.  The next, they see it as a cloister of scholarly seers who possess a mystical secret for instant success.<br /><br />Steve Fraser has written a Wall Street history that explores that dilemma's impact on the American psyche.  Americans remain preoccupied with the sins and virtues of the financial markets.  On one hand they remain committed to their ancestral values of hard work, play, equality, well-being and national purpose.  Yet, they are still magnetically drawn to promises of instant wealth and success.<br /><br />This well-written, thoroughly researched history explores this chronic tension.  Through the colorful tales of confidence men and aristocrats, he offers the reader unique insights into our collective view of American Capitalism and its changing culture.	2005-03-16

The First Amendment, prohibiting Congress from enacting any law abridging freedom of speech, is put to the test.<br /><br />Some judges and legal scholars reason the First Amendment is essential to self-government.

Intended for while-collar managers, Craig Storti provides non-Americans with cultural observations about office workers.  his goal, he says, is to provide useful generalizations of Americans at work. In the process, he provides them with enough background to take the guesswork and surprise out of dealing with them.<br /><br />Storti examines six values he believes account for American workplace attitudes and behaviors.  Among them:<br /><br />1. American is the land of opportunity.  The author suggests sounding positive.  Merely being realistic or objective may brand you as a pessimist.<br /><br />2. Can-do people.  Don't be afraid of trial and error.  Americans admire trying as much as succeeding.<br /><br />3. Equality for all.  Playing favorites is a recipe for failure.<br /><br />4. You are what you have done.  Eliminate elaborate procedures that obstruct action.<br /><br />5. You are on your own.  As a boss, paint the big picture.  Then get out of the way and let your subordinates get it done.<br /><br />6. Punctuality matters.  Be on time for appointments and meetings.<br /><br />Storti's generalizations are clear, telling and accurate.

Organizations that do not occupy a network hub.<br /><br />Business networks and biological networks, the authors explain, are governed by a common fate.  They base predictions on features that enable stability, longevity and productivity.  The authors offer three predictions:<br /><br />1. Expect more robustness in the face of external shocks.  Although damage is accompanied by widespread collapse, most problems will be absorbed.<br /><br />2. Expect networks to develop a capacity for creativity.<br /><br />3. Expect a heterogeneous structure, with each individual organization playing a unique, dramatic role.<br /><br />The authors view this evolving network as a renewal source, not an external threat.	2005-01-11

Their simple message often leaves me wanting.<br /><br />That was not the case with this book, which I received as a gift.  Perhaps it was the year.  I work for a large retail chain.  Two days before Thanksgiving, I found myself loathing the \\"Christmas Music\\" being played in the store to create a seasonal buying mood.<br /><br />In past years Advent was a time for me to contemplate Christ's birth.  This past year it turned into a time of contrasting emotions.  Eager to reunite with my family, the store's frenzy left me frazzled and indifferent.  I lost sight, frankly, of the reason for the season.<br /><br />For that reason, this book was exactly what I needed.  This anthology contained a daily essay from some of the best spiritual writers.  Each daily reading gave me a fresh outlook on the true meaning of the holiday season.	2005-01-05

Tom Wolfe's battle with depression is over.  He is back.  And this book is his best.<br /><br />Let there be no doubt.  I love reading Tom Wolfe's books.  He is always showing us something we have not quite appreciated.  In each book he creates a memorable scene.  Who can forget the \\"out came the dress uniforms\\" refrain in The Right Stuff; or how about the Masters of the Universe ramping the bond offering in The Bonfire of the Vanities? And then there is Chapter 4 - the visit to the work-out committee - in A Man in Full, one of the funniest chapters I have ever read.<br /><br />This book includes several.  There is the f**k and s**t patois, the shared bathroom in the co-ed dorm,  the pre-season basketball scrimmage before 10,000 fans, the football tailgate, the fraternity formal and the frat house mixer.  That a 74 year-old writer grasps the intricacies and nuances of the college youth culture is a tribute to his talent.  While I would love to know the origin of his amicus towards Lacrosse players, there is no question he spans the chasm of generations to capture the college life.<br /><br />This book may have been a long time coming, but here is one reader who prays Wolfe has one or two more books left in him.	2004-12-06

Appointed by President Clinton in 1996 to a partial term, Dr. Meyers witnessed the Fed's reaction to \\"the new economy,\\" \\"irrational exuberance,\\" the Asian financial crisis, the Russian Default, the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the bursting American Stock Bubble and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.<br /><br />In a well-written and readable book, Meyer re-lives the Fed's closed-door debates on these matters.  He gracefully weaves issues with anecdotes about the people involved.  The reader is transported behind the closed doors of the Fed and into the meeting room where policy matters are made.<br /><br />Personally, I was surprised at the quality and formality that debates on issues the Fed's agenda assumed.  Having become accustomed to the \\"pin everything on the other party\\" approach taken by Congress, I was shocked that monetary debates continue to assume an academic air.<br /><br />Meyer,  who is the first former fed member to pen a book about his experiences, has provided fed watchers with an extraordinary look into a fascinating period of our economic history.  It is well-worth reading.	2004-11-29

Separated by thirty years, we reached the same conclusion:  color and design encourages learning.<br /><br />Since I did my work, technology has undergone a sea-change.  Ms. Kirschenbaum, a teacher, writer and designer in New York City, uses it to illustrate passages from her next day's lessons to beautiful designs.

This combination has been absent since English Poet, William Blake.<br /><br />That is, until now.  This book is truly a work of art.  True to its sub-title, it represents a marriage of Art, Literature, Education and Technology.  Beautifully written and illustrated, it issues a clarion call to publishers to rethink their book designs.<br /><br />If I had forgotten the finer points of my research years ago, reading this book refreshed the memories.  I was not alone.  I opted to start reading it on a multiple-leg airplane trip.  The book's breathtaking illustrations quickly became the favored topic of conversation between and my traveling companions and me.<br /><br />As I explained the book's thesis to them, they volunteered occasions when they added color to simple messages and improved the desired response.<br /><br />If it was obvious to us, the point should not be lost on publishers.  If the author and her publisher can profit selling this unique work of art for an undiscounted (...), it is time for anyone who labors with words to rethink their presentation.	2004-11-11

Two parties, with profoundly different visions for the country, squared off.  The candidates were titans of their times.  The conservative stretched the Constitution to its limit in order to maximize the powers of the federal government.  The Liberal had strong egalitarian leanings.<br /><br />The election campaign give bar room brawls a good image.  Each side slung mud.

Once close friends, they were now bitter enemies.<br /><br />John Ferling, professor emeritus of history at State University West Georgia, breathes life into the personalities and this bitter campaign.  Jefferson's election, he concludes, consummated the American Revolution.

Those did not understand their material, went his corollary, resorted to compound, complex sentences to mask their lack of understanding.  This continuum, he termed \\"The Fog Index.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, this was probably the only lecture by this professor I understood that semester.<br /><br />In this book Siva Vaidhyanathan posits there are dangers posed by the increasing speed and amount of information available.  We resort, he says, to technological fixes to avoid discussions of the often complex and serious issues presented by this explosion.<br /><br />This conflict manifests itself when someone invents a device, algorithm or law that moves the system of digital information towards freer distribution.  The other side responds by pushing the distribution system back into their previous restraints.<br /><br />The book outlines several examples:<br /><br />* The battle to control public libraries, which are seen as breeding grounds for terrorism and pornography.<br /><br />* Attempts to restrict the use and distribution of encryption technology to prevent it from falling into the hands of terrorists and criminals.<br /><br />* Efforts by governments to regulate personal computers and networks to control  illicit flows of material.<br /><br />* Commercial and governmental efforts to regulate science and mathematics, including the human genome.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, and I believe, society, that is about all I understood.

He borrows from his avocations, psychology and archaeology, for perceptive insights into the financial landscape.<br /><br />Success in finance, he says, is an art form, not a science.  It relies on the vagaries of the human condition.  Readers who search this book for a secret wealth formula will be disappointed.  The only door, Levy says, that leads consistently to wealth, is access to privileged information.  As many have recently discovered, this path is fraught with peril.<br /><br />Yet, if investing is an art form, it can be learned.  The best way is to put yourself on the line.  Take a position.  Players outperform professors.  Recognize your weaknesses.  Seek to control them.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in Levy's insights into the collapse of Savings and Loans, the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management and the Internet Bubble.<br /><br />This book does not belong in the class bad books written by bored billionaire investors, too many of whom have confused luck with insight.  Although these individuals have a high regard for themselves, clarity, coherence and conciseness are not among the qualities which contributed to their success.<br /><br />Leon Levy is likeable, incredibly informed and nothing short of brilliant.

Writer Roy Morris recounts the Hayes-Tilden election of 1876, a contest which dragged on for four months of infighting and maneuvering.  Hayes eventually took the oath of office at night to avoid violence.<br /><br />On the other hand, Author Rich Perlstein writes about the rise of modern conservatism.  The lingering memory of many of the LBJ - Barry Goldwater campaign was how hated the conservative was.  Yet LBJ's support proved to be widespread but thin.<br /><br /> It contains essays on American exceptionalism and the leaders who promoted it.  There are essays on American Ingenuity and technological prowess.  Some authors demonstrate the benefits of American capitalism; others chronicle its downside.<br /><br />On American Character is a great addition to the Booknotes series.

I also know from my personal experience, outsourcing adds complexity to a project.  Paul Davies, an international businessman and consultant, has written a timely book addressing these issues.  He offers valuable insight into the advantages and benefits of outsourcing and off-shoring projects to India.  While acknowledging the substantial cost savings, he is not blind to the other side of the equation.  Citing Gartner Group analysts, he acknowledges about half of all outsourcing projects fail.<br /><br />Davies devotes the first part of his book to background on India as a country and as a worldwide services provider.  He offers insight into the types of services U. S. and European businesses can take offshore and how to select the right business partner or supplier.<br /><br />Next, he offers valuable insights into the Indian culture.  These lessons will help the newcomer avoid many of the problems newcomers to Indian out-sourcing experience.  Davies explores the mind and culture of the Indian people.  He offers valuable insights into local concepts of time and working, dressing, eating, traveling and tipping.<br /><br />Finally, he offers suggestions for successfully doing business in India.  Davies offers suggestions on how to write a business plan, due diligence, navigating risks and negotiating and haggling.  The early savings, he notes, are pale compared to the long-term benefits that will come from a long-term relationship.<br /><br />This is a timely book on a controversial subject.  I have personally lost work to out-sourcing; I have also out-sourced projects.  While I prefer the old days, I am convinced they are done.  The cost savings generated will not be ignored.

Information Technology and the Corrosion of Competitive Advantage	Books	5	22	27	N	N	IT as a Commodity	Information Technology (IT) has transformed itself from a source of competitive advantage to simply being a cost of doing business.<br /><br />Despite the spectacular gains during the past 50 years, says Nicholas G. Carr, a former Harvard Business Review executive editor, IT will distinguish no single competitor. This contradicts many executives' perception that IT ubiquity is an advantage. They miss the point the scarcity, not ubiquity, creates an advantage.<br /><br />IT's core functions - the storage, distribution and processing of data - are available to all. Without differentiation IT is relegated to commodity status. This should force executives to re-think their IT spending plans and their vendor relationships. As this perception gains acceptance, risk and cost control will become more important than investments in innovation. In short, technology is headed down the same path the steam engine, railroad and electricity followed. Only by becoming a shared and standardized resource will IT deliver its maximum social and economic potential.<br /><br />Carr says the greatest risk that IT represents is overspending.  While IT is entwined with many business processes and represents a huge portion of any businesses' expenses, it must be managed.  There are several ways:<br /><br />1. Cut waste.  Commoditization permits buyers to negotiate better deals, tie payments to usage and shop among vendors.<br /><br />2. Use Capacity.  The overspending in the 1990 left many companies with more capacity than they need.  Find ways to use it.<br /><br />3. Place tight controls on IT usage.  Carr says 70 percent of what is stored on corporate networks represents employees' saved e-mails, MP3s, video clips and spam.  Restrict the indiscriminate ability to save files.<br /><br />4. Become more rigorous in systems planning.<br /><br />Carr is a distinguished writer and thinker. His book serves as a wake-up call for anyone interested in competitive advantage. Although executives have grown wary of IT spending, they will have to cope with methods that will prevent the commoditization of IT architecture and applications if they are to save their companies' barriers to entry.<br /><br />Anyone - be he or she a business executive or IT worker - should give this tome a close examination.

Markets are turbulent.  After spending a lifetime studying wind and ocean currents, he applies his multi-fractal math to analyze financial markets.  \\"The tell-tale traces of turbulence are plainly there, in the price charts,\\" he writes.  The bell curve does not capture its changes.<br /><br />2.  Markets are inherently risky.  Turbulence is dangerous.  Market swings are wild and sudden.  They are difficult to predict, more difficult to hedge and even more difficult from which to profit.<br /><br />3.  Marketing timing matters.  Big gains and losses are concentrated into small time periods.  News events such as earnings or economic announcements drive stock market prices.<br /><br />4.  Prices leap suddenly.  This adds to risk.  News announcements compel investors to act simultaneously and instantaneously.<br /><br />Using his fractal tools, Mandelbrot describes how financial markets work.  He describes the volatile, dangerous and in a unique way, strangely beautiful properties that for which few financial experts account.<br /><br />This book is a must read for any serious investor.

Too many histories become footnote festooned tomes that talk of eras, movements and trends.  Gone is any sense that history represents the interaction of individuals.<br /><br />In this highly readable book, Mark Perry protrays a friendship between one of American cultural giants and its military greats: Mark Twain and U. S. Grant.  He explores how each man dealt with the American they experienced and how they interacted to impact each other's greatest work.<br /><br />Grant had a keen eye for detail and loved to relate unique wartime incidents.  Twain, as most acknowledge, was an accomplished storyteller.  Both had a rich reservoir of unique tales to tell.<br /><br />For Grant, a story's soul resided in its basic truth and humor.  For Twain, it lay in the detail - its nuance, mystery and unexpected outcome.  Grant loved to tell stories and told them well.  Twain toured the country telling stories, the taller the tale, the better.<br /><br />Together, they inspired the other's greatest masterpiece.  Inspired by Twain and suffering from cancer, Grant worked against his disease's deadline to complete his memoirs.  While working with Grant, Twain conceived of the ending to Huckleberry Finn.<br /><br />The book misses greatness by the inclusion of several errors.  Georgetown is not in Kentucky.  The street on which Twain lived in Buffalo, N. Y. was Delaware Avenue.  The name of the town in upstate New York was Geneseo.  While individually each of these errors is probably not major; together they detract from the story's credibility.  A reader deserves accuracy from an accomplished historian and his editors.<br /><br />Despite these lapses, I enjoyed the book.  It has a cast of fascinating characters:  Gen. William T. Sherman, William Dean Howells and Karl Gerhardt, to name a few.  It is a moving story of history, friendship, inspiration, failure and success.  In doing so, it depicts the age in which they lived.	2004-08-31

They argued that people could be persuaded by appealing to reason, emotion and the speaker's character.<br /><br />Judging from many of the presentations and speeches I hear and see one might be tempted to think the ancients were outdated.  In this 1928 book, classical scholar Rhys Roberts distills Aristotle's books on Rhetoric into 10 simple tips.  Followed, they will improve everyone's attempts to influence events and thinking.<br /><br />They are:<br /><br />1. Be logical.<br /><br />2. Think clearly.<br /><br />3. Reason lucidly.<br /><br />4. Argument is the soul of persuasion.<br /><br />5. Study human nature.<br /><br />6. Observe and react to your audience.<br /><br />7. Delivery is the essence of eloquence.<br /><br />8. Use language properly.<br /><br />9. Take time to organize your material.<br /><br />10.

I first heard it from a high school football coach more decades ago than I care to recall.<br /><br />\\"It is not the size of the dog in the fight that counts,\\" the coach said.  \\"What matters is the size of the fight in the dog.\\"<br /><br />The principles in The Underdog Advantage build winning attitudes and character.  According to authors David Morey and Scott Miller, these principles can drive your business, marketing and communications strategy.  Today the incumbent, the authors say, has fewer advantages.  Consumers are flooded with instant information.  As a result they feel overloaded.  The traditional rules of mass marketing no longer are no longer valid.  In this book the authors present the key concepts of the insurgent's strategy.  They also describe how to develop them into effective tactical planning.<br /><br />Using the model of a political campaign, the authors, illustrate the attitudes required for today's business environment.  On Election Day you either win or lose.  That reality frames an organization's objectives.  It creates a bolder, aggressive sprit that focuses the organization on nothing less than total victory.<br /><br />Overpowering force may still dominate markets, but it is an expensive way to win.  The authors note that insurgent strategies will help your organization gain ground, satisfy customers and keep happy, more productive and committed employees.	2004-08-18

In each company the group differs.  Yet every action taken by that group is undertaken with the goal of meeting the perceived needs and priorities of this group.<br /><br />Kleiner says core groups are not inherently evil or dysfunctional.  They are the source of the organization's energy, drive and direction.  The foundation of every organization is the decision.  Some are made at the top; others are made at lower levels of the organization.  Most are made in the midst of conflicting priorities, constraints competitors and constituents.  Core groups play a critical role.  By understanding who populates the core group, a collective organizational coordination is achieved.<br /><br />Core Groups can be large or small.  They have many identities; often the identity is mixed.  Among them:<br /><br />* A Bureaucracy - Bosses come and go; the core groups remains.<br /><br />* The Too Nice Organization - No one wants to admit they have power, yet one or two people influence decision making.<br /><br />* The Indigestible Acquisition - The deal is sealed but significant groups are not brought into the fold.<br /><br />* The Hidden Cabal - Quiet influencers who know how to influence the direction of people's decision making and covertly do it.<br /><br />* Charismatic Rainmakers<br /><br />* Stovepipes<br /><br />To determine a core group's character one must have insight into the mindset of the organizations people.  Whose interests they consider when they make decisions.<br /><br />This is an interesting book.  For those who love to get things done, corporate intrigue or simply want to survive, this book will open one's eyes to the reality of corporate culture.	2004-08-17

The war was won.  He had retired to pursue farming his \\"fig tree and vine\\" life along the banks of the Potomac River.<br /><br />Yet George Washington's mind could not remain fallow.  Watching the lazy tidal waters of the Potomac lap shores of his Mount Vernon plantation, he developed what author Joel Achenbach calls his Potomac Scheme.  The retired warrior planned a trip up the Potomac, over the Appalachians and into the frontier.  The excuse was to collect back rents on his properties.  The objective, however, was to lay the ground work for a plan that would transform the Potomac into a major commercial artery that would link the 13 newly established states with the unsettled West.<br /><br />There was a method to Washington scheme.  Achenbach, who describes himself as an explanatory journalist as opposed to an historian, details Washington's concern that the newly established country would fracture into separate nations.  The Potomac, Washington envisioned, could effectively bind the two regions.<br /><br />The book paints an insightful portrait of Washington.  Set between periods of public service, the reader sees a relaxed man, predisposed towards action.  A man who loves the outdoors; a man with an unquenchable entrepreneurial drive; a man who believes the country's destiny lays to the west.<br /><br />Achenbach took three years to research and write this largely uncovered period of Washington's life.  He spices his account with descriptions of the land's geography, politics, farmers and backwoodsmen, Indians and slaves.<br /><br />Thanks to Achenbach well-written \\"explanatory journalism,\\" Washington emerges as an engaging visionary not the stiff, aloof figure portrayed in history books.	2004-08-09

His process has six components.<br /><br />1. A problem - It must be significant and urgent.<br /><br />2. A group - The ideal group has between 4 and 8 diverse members.<br /><br />3. Questions - Initially, team members are restricted to questions.  This reflective inquiry period develops a thorough understanding of the problem.<br /><br />4.

A coach - Someone is needed to keep the group focused.<br /><br />A key step is \\"action.\\"  Learning is meaningful only if some type of action is taken.

Left to our own devices, Margaret Kornfeld says, this uprooting will manifest itself in more severe problems.  Communities of care, she says, have stepped in to fill this void.  These are groups that combine psychological with spiritual training to help individuals restore wholeness.<br /><br />Kornfeld, a pastoral psychotherapist, an American Baptist pastor, faculty member at Union Theological Seminary, has written an encyclopedic treatment of caregiving.

It is an inspiring, heartfelt story of the four decade relationship between the satirist and a surprisingly wise Benedictine monk named Father Joseph Warrillow.<br />Hendra, one of the original editors of National Lampoon, captures the beautiful essence of a truly God-inspired man.  The portrait that emerges is of one a cleric who is a credit to Church, a cleric who is a credit to his Christ.  Father Joe is truly a saint. Hendra, in a startling departure from his normal style, portrays Father Joe's actions as non-judgmental, caring, and engaged.<br />This is the most powerful book I have read in a long time.  If I have one criticism, it is Hendra's prodigious talent occasionally clouds this great story.  I would occasionally find myself re-reading a particularly clever or unique descriptive phrase.  However, you should properly view those words as the musings of a less talented, envious and jealous writer.<br />Father Joe is a tribute to one of the most charismatic, selfless, spiritual mentors of our time.  At times it is funny; at times it will bring tears to your eyes.  Tony Hendra experienced a miracle.  I am grateful he shared the story with me.  Read the book.

The election of 1912 was one of the few times since 1804 when the country was given the opportunity to debate its future.<br />James Chace, a history profession Bard College, spins an interesting and readable story about the four men who sought office.  Theodore Roosevelt, a former President, sought to redirect the Republican Party's focus towards nationalism and social justice.<br />William Howard Taft, his chosen successor, wanted only to sit on the Supreme Court.<br />Woodrow Wilson, the former president of Princeton, who surprised himself and the nation by snatching New Jersey governorship without the support of the state's political bosses.<br />Eugene Debs, running for the third time as a Socialist, sought economic justice for all the country's workers.<br />What made the 1912 campaign unusual by today's standards was the race was punctuated by a basic decency, honesty and quality of debate rarely seen in my lifetime.  Chace recounts it all.  1912 changed America.  Had Roosevelt been the Republican nominee he almost surely would have been re-elected president.  His platform would have transformed his party into the party of reform.<br /><br />Instead, the GOP passed into a conservative ascendancy that peaked with Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.  Today, the party still struggles between reform and reaction, isolationism and internationalism.<br />If you are tired of our current quadrennial circus, this trip into our nation's past may restore your faith in our system.  The election of 1912 dealt with substantive issues.  The candidates staked out differentiated positions.  The nation spoke.  Chace relates the story with all the zeal and passion it held for participants and voters in 1912.	2004-07-13

It is an understatement to say they exact a considerable toll on the organization.<br />According to Kenneth G. McGee, even the worst catastrophes rarely happen without warning.  The author is a group vice president and research fellow at Gartner, Inc., a consultancy that specializes in information technology.  His book, Heads Up, is about predicting the present.<br />Managers need to understand what is happening now and how these current events will impact future success.  This involves extracting raw empirical information, analyzing it and determining its meaning and implications.<br />So what is new, you ask?  McGee answers managers do not need all the data to understand the present.  Only enough to answer the question, \\"Where are we right now in meeting our corporate goals?\\"<br />To an effective executive, this current information always reveals opportunities to improve results.  There is a tendency to confuse real-time information with real-time response.  In the perfect situation, the following processes happen in the background between the time when an event happens and that event's impact is felt.<br />1. Information related to the event is monitored.<br />2. A change in the information is captured.<br />3. The information is analyzed.<br />4. The information is reported.<br />5. A response is initiated.<br />No manager can afford to monitor all his information sources.  To determine which sources to monitor, information should be filtered using the following Identification Model:<br />1. List goals for the planning period.<br />2. Prioritize them.<br />3. Evaluate them.<br />4. List causal events.<br />5. Prioritize the causal events.<br />6. Evaluate whether the real-time information will enable the executive to respond effectively.<br />Each candidate generated by the Identification Model is subjected to the Justification Model:<br />1. Does the goal the information further the corporate vision and mission?<br />2. Does the goal meet current corporate priorities?<br />3. Is the information material to the goal?<br />4. What is the goal's corporate impact?<br />McGee's book goes beyond the usual real-time hype.  It will help executives anticipate events and changes.

Whether one is attempting to introduce a major organizational change or convince consumers to switch brands, the ability to change people minds is an important business process.<br />Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist who specializes in cognitive theory, offers us insight into what happens when one changes his or her mind.  In order to change someone's mind, Gardner writes, one has to produce a shift in that person's perceptions, codes and the way he or she retains and accesses information.<br />There are seven levers to change, he says.<br />1. Reason.<br />2. Research<br />3. Resonance<br />4. Re-descriptions<br />5. Rewards<br />6. Real World Events<br />7.

To millions of viewers, it is a moment they will never forget.<br />Official inquiries into the accident placed the blame with a \\"frozen, brittle O ring.\\"  In this book, Diane Vaughan, a Boston College Professor of Sociology, does not stop there.  In what I think is a brilliant piece of research, she traces the threads of the disaster's roots to fabric of NASA's institutional life and culture.<br />NASA saw itself competing for scarce resources.  This fostered a culture that accepted risk-taking and corner-cutting as norms that shaped decision-making. Small, seemingly harmless modifications to technical and procedural standards propelled the space agency toward the disaster.  No specific rules were broken, yet well-intentioned people produced great harm.<br />Vaughan often resorts to an academic writing style, yet there is no confusion about its conclusion.<br />\\"The explanation of the Challenger launch is a story of how people who worked together developed patterns that blinded them to the consequences of their actions,\\" wrote Dr. Vaughan.<br />\\"It is not only about the development of norms but about the incremental expansion of normative boundaries: how small changes--new behaviors that were slight deviations from the normal course of events- gradually became the norm, providing a basis for accepting additional deviance.  Nor rules were violated; there was no intent to do harm.  Yet harm was done.

This book gave me everything I needed to build websites designed to appeal to the male buyer of custom suits and shirts.  Unlike the fashion buyer, Flusser believes permanent fashion starts with being accountable to a personal set of physical characteristics.<br />The custom buyer's face's shape, neck's height, shoulder's width, arm's length and torso's structure, and the foot's size remain relatively constant.  Once he relates the permanent fashion's fundamentals to his physique and complexion, he is on his way to building a stylish, cost-effective wardrobe that will withstand fashion's seasonable vagaries.<br />This book contains a large collection of photographs of stylish men.  These vintage photographs illustrate the range and diversity of authentic men's fashion.  Along the way, magnitude of options will equip the reader with both the vocabulary and options required to build a custom wardrobe.

At the very least that requires drawing a character with at least two dimensions, preferably three.  Frey failed.<br />I finished the book, so it rates three stars.  But, in the interest of full disclosure, I was glad I borrowed it from the library.	2004-06-14

This encounter was to challenge the foundations of his life's study.<br />An ox was on display and for six-pence fair-goers could buy a stamped and numbered ticket, fill in their names and their guesses of the animal's weight after it had been slaughtered and dressed.  The best guess received a prize.<br />Eight hundred people tried their luck.  They were diverse.  Many had no knowledge of livestock; others were butchers and farmers.  In Galton's mind this was a perfect analogy for democracy.  He wanted to prove the average voter was capable of very little.  Yet to his surprise, when he averaged the guesses, the total came to 1197 pounds.  After the ox had been slaughtered, it weighted 1198.<br />James Surowiecki takes Galton's counterintuitive notion and explores its ramification for business, government, science and the economy.  It is a book about the world as it is.  At the same time, it is a book about the world as it might be.  Most of us believe that valuable nuggets of knowledge are concentrated in few minds.  We believe the solution to our complex problems lies in finding the right person.  When all we have to do, Surowiecki demonstrates over and over, is ask the gathered crowd.<br />The well-written book is divided into two parts.  The first deals with theory; the second offers case studies.  Believe it or not, I found it to be a page-turner.  The author has that precious ability to render the complex in simple, understandable and interesting prose.<br />I have long been an admirer of H. L. Mencken who once wrote, \\"No one is this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.\\"<br />By the time I finished this book, I believed Mencken was wrong.	2004-06-14

Ron Chernow's biography relates the details of an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan who rose to become George Washington's key aide-de-camp, battlefield hero, Constitutional Convention delegate, co-author of The Federalist Papers, Federalist Party head and the country's first Treasury Secretary.<br />Hamilton was a rare revolutionary: fearless warrior, master administrator and blazing administrator.  No other moment in American history could have better employed Hamilton's abundant talents and energy.<br />As Treasury Secretary, the country benefited from his abilities as a thinker, doer, skilled executive and political theorist.  He was a system builder who devised and implemented interrelated policies.<br />As in the Revolution, Hamilton and Washington complemented each other.  Washington wanted to remain above the partisan fray.  He was gifted with superb judgment.  When presented with options, he almost always made the correct choice.  His detached style left room for assertiveness.  Especially in financial matters, Hamilton stepped into the breach.<br />Washington was sensitive to criticism, yet learned to control his emotions.  Hamilton, on the other hand, was often acted without tact and was naturally provocative.<br />Perhaps the main reason Hamilton accomplished so much was Washington agreed with his vision of 13 colonies welded into a single, respected nation.  Chernow presents a well-written and nuanced portrait that arguably is the most important figure in American history that never attained the presidency.  Though his foreign birth denied him the ultimate prize, his accomplishments produced a far more lasting impact than many who claimed it.nd nuanced portrait that arguably is the most important figure in American history that never attained the presidency.

While his observations on his early life were insightful, he failed to deal realistically with his career at Chase Manhattan.<br />Throughout the book, he touts his personal connections with world leaders as the reason Chase Manhattan became a leading international bank.  Yet he all but ignores that this debt was a major cause of the bank's downfall.  If he takes credit for the connections, he should assume responsibility when the debt defaults.<br />On the other hand, I found his observations about his brother, Nelson, unique and insightful.  He sees the greatness tempered by the flaws.<br />In my mind the highlights of David Rockefeller's career start when he retired from Chase Manhattan and dedicated himself to the family office.  The story of the sale and subsequent repurchase of Rockefeller Center represents the pinnacle of a financial career.<br />This is a well-written book.  For someone, like me with an interest in finance and public service, it is a great read.  David Rockefeller would rate five stars if only he had dealt more candidly with his failures at Chase Manhattan.	2004-06-02

Sales are based on conversations, not presentations.<br />2. Asking relevant questions versus rendering opinions.<br />3. Solutions rather than relationships earn buyers' respect.<br />4. Target businesspeople versus users.<br />5. Sell usage, not reliance.<br />6. Salespeople manage managers rather than needing to be managed.<br />7.

He identifies when and how, beginning in the 1820s, each played an accelerating role in our growth.<br />Bernstein's examination of the role these effects had on people's personal lives adds to this book's value.  By identifying the causes of our prosperity, Bernstein provides the reader with a personal platform to assess where we are currently headed.<br />Surprisingly, the author argues progress has been slowing since 1850.  The average resident of the Western world alive in 1950 would have no trouble accepting the technology of the year 2000.  This was not the case in 1800.

You have to be nuts to start a business.<br />Barry Moltz presents a refreshing, realistic and candid look at entrepreneurial success.  H realistic advice goes beyond mission statements and branding.  Instead he focuses on psychological issues.  His years of experience had led him to the conclusion that two elements play an enormous role in a startup's cusses:  luck and timing.<br />Most startups do not sell people anything, he says.  Rather, they positioned themselves to supply a need when the customers are ready to buy.  As an entrepreneur you have to learn to accept what is beyond your control.  This translates into celebrating your victories and learning to navigate your failures.<br />This book is a thoughtful look at entrepreneurialism.  It draws a clear distinction between liking a business space and knowing how to run a business.  Some may say doing what you love is the path to riches.  Moltz would disagree.  Not every hobby, he warns, should be pursued as a livelihood.	2004-05-12

The Leebs believe we are transitioning away from reliance on oil and gas as our primary energy sources.  As supplies dwindle, the price is experiencing an upside breakout, which will place inflationary pressures on the economy in conjunction with deflationary threats.<br />The Leebs predict the dwindling energy supplies will cause oil price will rise to $100 a barrel by the end of this decade, if not sooner.  They observe that oil prices are the single most reliable predictor of stock market performance.  That is why they urge investors to alternate between inflation and deflation positions using their \\"amazing oil indicator.\\"<br />Generally, I am skeptical of simplistic investment approaches.  In my experience these indicators work only for investors whom I charitably call \\"donators.\\"  Donators are a necessary market group, but I do not generally want to join.  In this case, however, I agree with the underlying thesis.  Energy is a non-renewable resource to which the world's economy is hopelessly addicted.  As the world transitions, there will be disruptions.  I doubt they will take the form of a short-term, neat, predictable package.	2004-05-11

The media, however, can be singularly successful at telling Americans what to think about.  If you doubt this, simply take a look at this book's reviews.  Everyone has an opinion and my hunch is that none of those opinions were changed by their reading of the book.<br />There is no doubt that Woodward is a gifted reporter.  Not only does he possess access to the key players, but also the ability to gain their confidence.  Sources talk to Woodward.  Once he garners the sources recollections of what happened, he relates to the reader in a clear and concise fashion.<br />At a time when we are being asked to place our children in harm's way, in a part of the world that few of us have even visited, serious policy questions come to mind.  A book affords the proper media for questions of this nature to be explored.  Bob Woodward, true to his journalistic training, does not venture here.  Rather, the reader is given a blow-by-blow account of the stage entrances and exits of key Washington players reconstructed from interviews and notes of the players.<br />There is no thoughtful review of the questions raised. These are conclusions I can draw from reading my daily newspaper. I recognize that television's pervasive influence has forced other media outlets to adapt a tabloid view of the world in order to compete for eyeballs. The type of book I want to read takes longer to prepare, if it is going to be done well.<br />Clearly Bob Woodward and his publisher did not have that luxury. The market is hot; the public is being subjected to a cascade of Bush bashing books. Clearly a newspaper, like the Washington Post where the author serves as Assistant Managing Editor, provides the best medium to distribute this type of detailed reporting.  But then again, that cuts out the book publisher.<br />It is at times like this when I recognize how old-fashioned I have become. Quality reporting belongs in the pages of a quality daily newspaper where it can be published in a timely fashion.  Books should be reserved for the policy questions raised by that reporting.<br />The good news is given the facts, the American public has the capacity to sort and arrive at a conclusion.

Tufte concludes the convenience of PowerPoint comes at a cost to content and the audience.<br />Presentations succeed or fail based on their quality relevance and integrity of their content.  At a minimum, the presentation format should not harm the content.  Yet Tufte, a retired professor of design at Yale University, notes audiences absorb information at higher rates than those presented in the typical PowerPoint Presentation.<br />For serious presentations, he says, it is useful to replace PowerPoint sides with paper handouts showing words, numbers, data, graphics and images.  Presentations should reflect good teaching.  Communicate core ideas with explanation, content and credible authority.<br />There is no question that PowerPoint is an aide to those presenters who are inept or extremely disorganized.  These people should learn that if they cannot summarize their point in a single sentence.  If not, they should do themselves and their audiences a favor by declining the invitation to speak.<br />For the rest, reliance on this software crutch gives the speaker a false sense of doing well and for audiences to pretend they are listening.<br />As Tufte concludes, this little dance punctuates the question, \\"Why are we having this meeting?\\"	2004-04-19

Too many of Grisham's books, in my opinion, conclude with forced endings.  It is almost as if the author is worn-out by the plot and his characters so he forces the story into an unreal finish.<br />That is not the case with this book.  Set in the south during desegregation, the end of the Viet Nam War and the beginning of suburban and rural sprawl, Grisham characters are believable.  They reflect the times in which they live.  They live; they die.  They enjoy success; they struggle with life's dilemmas.<br />This is not your typical Grisham novel.  I, for one, am grateful for that.  Novelists should grow with experience.

Along the way, he delivers a devastation attach on the Bush family image.<br />The author offers enlightening research and insights into the Bush family history.  Yet it is his portrayal of a growing entanglement between what was once temporary elected office and the permanent government that is cause for concern.  This trend, Phillips argues, would have horrified our founding fathers.  It comes as no surprise to me.  In a age that relies on media as opposed to personal contact, name recognition and branding play an important role in our elections.<br />This trend goes deeper than the Bushes.  In my own state of Connecticut, we are surrounded by this dynastic trend.  Our senior Senator is the son of a former Senator.  To our north in Massachusetts, family politics dominate the political scene and have spilled over into Rhode Island.  To our west, the junior Senator from New York has positioned herself for a run for the presidency, a position her husband recently held.<br />Other than a brief acknowledgement of this trend, the author illustrates his thesis using four generations of Bush leadership.  He shows how an alliance between George Herbert Walker and Samuel P. Bush before World War I solidified the family position on the national scene with a single-minded focus on the critical areas of energy, intelligence and finance.<br />He argues the Bush family has marshaled all of its resources to create a political dynasty that gained access to the White House and further its family and ideological agenda.<br />The author's reputation adds to the power of the book.  Kevin Phillips has authored at least three brilliant books:  The Emerging Republican Majority, The Politics of Rich and Poor and Wealth and Democracy.  Hardly a flamethrower, he offered clarity.  These books represented my first exposure to emerging national trends.<br />Trained as a lawyer, he delivers a skillful and thought-provoking indictment against dynastic leadership.  The book is worth reading, whether you think you agree with its premise or not.ented my first exposure to emerging national trends.<br />Trained as a lawyer, he delivers a skillful and thought-provoking indictment against dynastic leadership.

Separated by thirty years, we reached the same conclusion:  color and design encourages learning.<br />Since I did my work, technology has undergone a sea-change.  Ms. Kirschenbaum, a teacher, writer and designer in New York City, uses it to illustrate passages from her next day's lessons to beautiful designs.  She discovered responded with increased comprehension, retention and attentiveness - not a surprise for a generation reared on television, movies, the internet and video games.<br />She believes and effectively advocates for the return of what she terms the \\"designer-writer\\"; an artist who communicates with the written word and art.  This combination has been absent since English Poet, William Blake.<br />That is, until now.  This book is truly a work of art.  True to its sub-title, it represents a marriage of Art, Literature, Education and Technology.  Beautifully written and illustrated, it issues a clarion call to publishers to rethink their book designs.<br />If I had forgotten the finer points of my research years ago, reading this book refreshed the memories.  I was not alone.  I opted to start reading it on a multiple-leg airplane trip.  The book's breathtaking illustrations quickly became the favored topic of conversation between and my traveling companions and me.<br />As I explained the book's thesis to them, they volunteered occasions when they added color to simple messages and improved the desired response.<br />If it was obvious to us, the point should not be lost on publishers.  If the author and her publisher can profit selling this unique work of art ..., it is time for anyone who labors with words to rethink their presentation.	2004-02-25

Soon lawyer Jack Hammond, is doing the crying.  As a result of his love affair with a client's girl friend, he tumbles from defending Atlanta's corporate elite to trawling the bottom of its criminal pool for clients.<br />The story of his journey back to personal respectability is, however more than your average thriller.<br />It is not often that a new writer creates believable, complex characters that find themselves in poignant, often, tender relationships.  It is a thriller for thinking readers.  Best of all, it is story that flies.  Despite Arvin's unique insights on race, business ethics, your past burdens, science, technology and love, the story never drags.<br />My only complaint with the book is with Arvin's inaccurate use of stock market jargon.  But if this book is as successful as I think it will be, he will not have to worry.  He will quickly develop a familiarity with that specialized vocabulary as he invests his residuals and future advances.	2004-02-17

Bush (Book & CD)	Books	5	22	24	N	N	Presidential Tour Guides	The history of the United States comes alive in the words of its presidents.<br />There comes a dramatic time in the life of a person, party, organization or nation that cries for the uplift and release of a speech.  Someone is called upon to articulate the pride, hope or grief of it all.  The speaker becomes the center of attention and the world stops to listen.<br />That responsibility is often shouldered by our President.  Great Presidents not only act as the country's head of state, but also the voice of its people.  They help define who we are and what we experience.  In my opinion, their speeches constitute one of the best expressions of the nation's mood.<br />This book presents 40 of the nation's greatest Presidential speeches.  Former Clinton Speechwriter Michael Waldman, introduces them, anchors them in history and explains their impact.<br />Acknowledging that speeches are written for the ear, not the eye, this book contains two CD that allow you to hear many of these actual speeches.

James, the sixth in Scotland and the first in England, viewed it as an opportunity to unify his kingdom.<br />To create this translation - a project many consider to be the greatest work of English prose - he assembled about 50 scholars to do the work.  Despite their individual failings - drink, ambition, self-promotion, obsequiousness, greed and pedantry-they labored together for seven years to give the first Stuart king his translation.  It is a text, which for all of its failings, is without equal.<br />Its language drips with potency and sensitivity.  The English language had just reached its age of maturity.  This translation reflected the times - boisterous, subtle, majestic, nuisanced and musical.  King James' Bible reflects the Jacobean England.  This book relates not only the translation's tale, but also the England of Shakespeare, Bacon, the plague and the Gunpowder plot.<br />It is insightful read into the greatest monument of those times.	2004-02-10

Together with a rogue CIA operative, he launches what we are told is one of the largest and most successful covert operations in U.S. history.<br />The author and veteran producer of CBS news magazine 60 minutes and 60 minutes II, George Crile, tells the tale in an engaging and well-written fashion.  Yet it appears that he never learned the lesson I was taught in my first journalism class:  \\"avoid minor mistakes so your readers will be more forgiving when you make a large one.\\"<br />I was not through 10 per cent of the book before I had found three factual errors.  Let me give you an example.  On page 43 and 44, Crile refers to the Hall of Fame football player, Mike Ditka, as a linebacker.  Ditka played tight end.  This mistake does not change the point the author was trying to make.  But what happened to the \\"check every fact before using it in your story\\" lesson taught in the same journalism class?<br />The lesson is this.  I know a little about football; I know nothing about CIA Appropriations or the Mujahideen.  Why should I believe Crile's reporting is any more credible?<br />This book reads as well as any well-written non-fiction thriller.

Along the path, they co-opted the system's traditional restraints: full disclosure, public accounts and corporate attorneys.<br />I was disappointed Lowenstein failed to include the Richard Grasso incident.  As the head of the New York Stock Exchange and regulator of virtually every individual mentioned in the book, his pursuit of personal wealth at the expense of those he was charged with regulating would have served as the icing and cherry on top of this tale of greed.<br />Regardless, this well-researched and powerfully written portrait of the rise and fall of the bull market of the 1990s will studied by market historians for decades to come.	2004-01-22

It includes special sections that speak to the problems and techniques of communicating in the project environment.<br />If accepted and adopted by the diverse project management community, this book has the potential to establish a consistent platform.  Team members would free their creative talents.  No more time wasted time attempting to communicate.<br />Once, I believed all project management practitioners should own three books:  Visualizing Project Management, Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling and Controlling and The Fast Forward in Project Management.<br />It is time to clear some space on your Project Management bookshelf.  Communicating Project Management has earned a spot there - and it promises not to collect dust.	2003-07-28

We become creatures of habits.  We approach daily challenges in predictable ways.  In the authors' word, we are \\"stalled.\\"  We have developed habits that prevent us from achieving our full potential.<br />The authors prescribe a simple, well-written eight-step process to overcome these personal and organizational obstacles.  The goal is to institute new habits built around asking and answering new and better questions.  Like an athlete, if the prescription is followed daily, you and your organization will learn to bypass the stalls that tap potential.<br />Follow this inspired, yet commonsense approach, you may, indeed, \\"make it over the back fence.\\"	2003-07-11

He is not special; he is not godly; he is not righteous.  Yet God sought him because he was faithful and trusted he would rise to his lofty standards.<br />Don't expect scholarly story.  Feiler explores how the three religions viewed Abraham in throughout their history, and how those perspectives have changed.  He seeks  to unite the three monotheistic religions in a productive dialogue where they meet on the common ground their origins in Abraham. He presents an Abraham to whom we can relate.<br />In doing so, he offers the world a rare vision of hope.	2003-06-06

Have customers; collect receivables; remit payables; weather disasters; out-maneuver competitors and not unimportantly; report profits.<br />Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles, two Massachusetts-based business consultants, in their third book, challenge managers to recognize that business model obsolescence is the major unperceived opportunity for and at the same time threat to their enterprises.  By simply adding these five foundational principles to the list, they can become \\"all they can be\\":<br />1. Serve more people with what is perceived as improved performance, more rapidly and in more ways with fewer resources.<br />2. Make each thought and activity apply to people and their purposes that are not now being served.<br />3. Involve more people when considering each thought and activity.<br />4. Begin each morning with the thought you are starting a new company.<br />5. Strengthen your stakeholders' commitment to these principles.<br />There can be little doubt that if more managers attached each day armed with these principles, their companies, customers and everyone they contacted would experience improved lives.	2003-05-09

The Internet creates value by lowering the costs of information transmission.  Internet boosters went wrong when they sought to re-write the foundational laws of economics practiced by their bricks-and-mortar competitors.  The impact of economies of scale depends on the industry, not on whether the company is internet-based or not.<br />The author also debunks three other \\"new\\" economy myths:<br />* The first mover advantage.  Many internet companies mistakenly rushed to market with inferior products and services - and paid the ultimate price.<br />* Not everything can be sold on the Internet.<br />* Customer service still counts.<br />Liebowitz argues network effects, economies of scale; instant scalability and winner-take-all strategies provide advantages and disadvantages to the consumer.  To know which products are likely to succeed on the Internet, the business person must consider:<br />* Size and bulk of the product relative to its value.<br />* Immediate gratification factor.<br />* Perishable items are not meant to be shipped over long distances.<br />* Some products need to be experienced.<br />This well-written, often witty book is the first I have come across that seeks to salvage lesions from what is commonly thought of as the \\"Internet Bubble.\\"  The impact of the Internet on our society is not to be trivialized.  Information is now available in abundance.  Discovering the lessons the media's boosters ignored, Liebowitz argues, if one seeks to learn what the media's \\"boosters\\" ignored to their peril, will benefit the reader.	2003-04-29

From organizational behavior and structure to planning, scheduling and controlling processes vital to the successful practice of project management.  Most of the vital issues are discussed in a thorough, thoughtful way.<br />If the book has a weakness, it is in the area of Integration - in my mind, the most difficult section of the PMP exam.  The book is not only written as an undergraduate and graduate students, but also functional and senior managers.  Its structure reveals the author's apparent belief that the practice of project management is more behavioral than quantitative.<br />His first five chapters lay the foundation for an understanding of project management principles.  Chapters 6 through 8 deal with support functions of conflict and time management; chapters 9 and 10 deal with management support.  Quantitative approaches to planning, time, cost and performance are developed in Chapters 11 to 15.  Chapter 16 deals discusses trade-offs.

Killing Pablo is the story of the rise and violent fall of the Colombian cocaine cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar.  Although others, such as Tom Clancy, have attempted to tell the tale as fiction, nothing compares to this intense sixteen month manhunt.<br />Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down, draws on his access with soldiers, field agents and officials as well as secret documents and telephone transcripts of Escobar's intercepted telephone conversations to detail how U. S. operatives and their Columbian allies covertly lead this 16 month manhunt for Pablo Escobar.<br />Although Bowden details Escobar's rise to his position as the world's most powerful criminal, he devotes most of the book to detailing the time from July 22nd when Escobar walked out of a luxuriously prison he built for himself and disappeared into the jungle.<br />Over the next days and months, the U. S. would launch a joint military and intelligence operation, equipped with the latest tracking technology, and with the Columbian government track down this ruthless \\"doper\\" from Medellin.  This time, however, they had no intention of capturing him.  They planned to kill him.<br />This spell binding tale is a great read about ruthless justice in the real world	2003-03-12

Too much strategic thinking these days is driven, in my opinion, by a desire to appeal to Wall Street investment bankers and analysts or by a dot.bomb-fueled fear of failure.<br />Strategy is a two-headed prong.  It is creative enough to fashion a vision, while being disciplined enough to drive the vision into reality.<br />Mike Freedman defines the word as the framework of choices that determine the nature and direction of an organization.  It is a definition I like.  The word framework establishes boundaries and scope.  Choices are about products, services, markets and capabilities.  Nature describes the character of any organization.  Direction is the organizations course determined by choices about future products, services, customers and markets.<br />Notice that a decision is not strategic simply because it is long-term or involves mega-dollar expenditures.  While these can be made within the strategic framework, only those decisions that change the framework are strategic.<br />Freedman says there are three critical aspects to a strategy:<br />1. A strategic vision is based on facts, informed assumptions and critical what-if thinking.<br />2. The vision must be communicated throughout the organization.<br />3. Its implementation must be monitored.<br />I particularly enjoyed the section on Strategic Master Project Planning.  Freedman says the purpose of master project plan is to assess the necessary strategic initiatives, integrate the existing operation projects, identify project priority and interdict those projects which are out of line with the strategic vision.<br />This is a great book.  As always, organizations that desire to survive and thrive will have to mast the art of strategy creation and implementation.  The Kepner-Tregoe five phase model on which Freedman bases this book is a great foundation for organizations and managers who wish to begin the journey.to begin the journey.	2003-03-05

He was dedicated to the goal of unconditional surrender by Germany.  Forced to deal with Churchill and Stalin to achieve this goal, he may also have feared that any complaint on his part may have spurred Hitler to complete his goal all the more quickly.<br />In hindsight, this decision may seem harsh and insensitive to the Jews who suffered, yet it is the only credible explanation of Roosevelt's thinking I have found.	2003-02-19

Kennedy's Presidential Inauguration.<br />Although I have only owned this book for only a few months, it is already littered with Post-it notes marking the location of my favorite poems.  I am told this is the only comprehensive volume of Frost's 11 published books.  Edward Lathem, a Frost scholar and editor of this volume, includes bibliographical information on the poems' publication and specifies the textual changes Frost made over the years.<br />Although I have decades of exposure to Frost's work, I inevitably find a new nuance or thought as I thumb through this volume's pages.  It is a fitting tribute to a four-time Pulitzer Prize winner and a man I consider the United States' greatest poet.	2003-02-13

Kennedy's Presidential Inauguration.  Struggling with the bright sunlight reflecting off the fresh snow on that crisp winter's day, he abandoned his effort to recite an older poem from memory.<br />I remember thinking the image of this short, stocky white-haired old man was as close to a wood nymph as I would ever come.  Later, I was to learn that Frost lead anything but a simple life.  Biographer drawing on this image, often sensationalized the details of his life at the expense of the precious poetry he created.<br />Jay Parini, the Axinn Professor of English at Middlebury College, does not travel that path.  Rather, he provides his readers with insight into how Frost lived day-to-day, poem to poem.  He animates Frost's daily struggles with depression, anxiety, self-doubt and confusion.  The poet's family life was not happy; he experienced bad luck with his children.  Yet, he exhibited tremendous force of will, love for his children and dedication to creating a lasting body of creative work.<br />Unlike Frost previous biographers, Parini skillfully weaves the details of the poet's life with poetry he created.  Frost's desire to \\"lodge a few poems where they can't be gotten rid of easily\\" is woven into a picture of an artist attempting to rescue his sanity by creating what he called a \\"momentary stay against confusion.\\"<br />For me, reading Frost's poetry is a labor of love; reading Parini's biography is like reliving a best friend's life.  This biographical study offers an unusual glimpse into the life, poetry and times of Robert Frost, a man who ranks as one of the world's greatest poets.	2003-02-04

The market demands that corporations respect their employees, be reliable to their customers and communities and be transparent with their investors.<br />The author argues \\"ethics counts\\" provides corporations with value-added in the truth, loyalty, gratitude and reciprocal respect it engender among its stakeholders.  The new bottom line: a corporation's success comes down to the quality of its decision making.  Moral scrutiny is becoming as important as financial performance in stakeholders' evaluations.	2003-01-10

When they encounter tough times in their base businesses; they decide to enter new ones.  Too many refuse met the challenge to resurrect, resuscitate, strengthen their base businesses and head off into uncharted waters.<br />Second, getting things done, he says, is the most underappreciated skill of an effective business executive.<br />Third, they lead by creating high performance cultures.  They are visible, set goals, measure results and hold people accountable.<br />This is a well-written book that Gerstner claims was compiled without the aid of a ghostwriter.  So, not only can the former McKinsey &amp; Co. executive focus, execute and lead, he can also write.  IBM was a disaster when he was recruited to revive it.  Few thought it could be done without breaking it into smaller pieces.  The man who saw things differently has something to offer IBMers, former IBMers and investors.	2002-12-16

The chapters focus on logging, pasture abandonment, fire, beaver activity, blow downs, forest blights, topography and substrate and their impact on the plants located near these disturbances.<br />Each chapter discusses the disturbance and then in a section entitled \\"A Look Back\\" the disturbance is related to the site's natural history.  This new way of seeing a forest and its history adds to my walks in the woods.  I feel a connection, a reverence, an enhancement and an inclusion that was not part of my previous walks.

He photographed the conflict from the early days of American involvement in 1962 until 1971, when he died in a helicopter shot down over the Vietnam-Laos border.  His images stoked much of the anti-war sentiment that enveloped my generation.<br />To see his photo essays is to relive those tortured times.  While depicting what are often horrifying moments, this book is, at the same time, a celebration of Burrows courage, compassion and nose for news.  The pictures are brutal, poignant and at the time, timely.  They represent photojournalism at it best; harsh reality raised to an art form.	2002-12-05

Had analysts fit the technology to the business model, we may have had a different experience.<br />A major theme of this book is that unless one keeps a clear eye on the four principle  - business, people, process and technology -  business drivers, it is difficult, if not impossible, to steer a course towards success.<br />There is no escaping the fact the Internet merely enables a more well-planned approach to securing a strategic position in a competitive market.

Rather, we are given a blow-by-blow account of the stage entrances and exits of key Washington players reconstructed from interviews and notes of the players.<br />Instead of a thoughtful review of the questions raised, we are treated to theater-like criticism of the players.  Instead of finishing the book with conclusions like \\"this is, or is not, the proper foreign policy for the world's only super power,\\" we are left with conclusions like \\"Bush is focused,\\"  \\"Bush is in charge,\\" \\"Condoleezza Rice plays an important role on the team,\\" \\"Dick Cheney, a hardliner, did not appear to cooperate with the reporter\\" and \\"Donald Rumsfeld is a crafty agitator.\\"<br />These are conclusions I can draw from reading my daily newspaper.  I recognize that television's pervasive influence has forced other media outlets to adapt a tabloid view of the world in order to compete for eyeballs.  The type of book I want to read takes longer to prepare, if it is going to be done well.  Clearly Bob Woodward and his publisher did not have that luxury.  The market was hot; the holiday book selling season was upon us.  Clearly a newspaper, like the Washington Post where the author serves as Assistant Managing Editor, provides the best medium to distribute this type of detailed reporting, but then again, that would cut out the book publisher.<br />It is at times like this when I recognize how old fashioned I have become.  Quality reporting belongs in the pages of a quality daily newspaper where it can be published in a timely fashion; books should be reserved for the policy questions raised by that reporting.<br />Please excuse me while I hone the tip of my quill pen.en.	2002-12-02

Radical solutions to unsolvable problems were their only escape.  In the 1790s, when farming was the only occupation, a growing population and a soil spent by generations of misuse, resulted in a dearth of farmable land.  With no prospects and no future, individuals like Eli Whitney and Thomas Blanchard, were forced to look for creative solutions to society's problems and set in motion an industrial revolution.<br />I was particularly intrigued by the story of Frederick Tudor, the man who in 1806 introduced ice to Martinique.  It is one thing to sell ice to people who because of their location, understand the concept.  It is quite another, to sell ice to people who have never experienced it, to say nothing about the practical necessities of ice houses to warehouse the product.<br />His father's real estate speculation losses left Tudor with nothing but ambition and a house with a pond in Saugus, MA.  He succeeded after two difficult decades.  There was always a wrinkle to be solved before a fortune could be built.  Iceboxes had to be designed and then marketed in southern ports to people who had to be taught how to preserve it.<br />This phenomenon explains why there so many Crystal and Silver Lakes dot the New England landscape, relics of an enterprising age.  Savvy ice dealers understood that attractive names sell products.  For a brief period even Muir's Bullough's Pond was briefly renamed Silver Lake.<br />Diana Muir e-mailed me twice during the past two years introducing her book to me.  Having read her book, I am grateful for her persistence.  If you enjoy reading unique looks at our history, I implore not to wait for her to contact you.

Nutt, who has spent more than 20 years studying how decision are made, says failures can be traced to three blunders and seven traps.  Avoiding the blunders and the traps they set will cut one's failure rate significantly.<br />The blunders to avoid:<br />* Failure-Prone Practices<br />* Premature Commitments<br />* Wrong-Headed Investments.<br />These blunders lead unsuspecting managers into seven ensnaring traps:<br />* Failure to Reconcile Claims<br />* Failure to Manage the Forces Created by a Decision<br />* Ambiguous Directions<br />* Limited Search with No Innovation<br />* Misuse of Evaluation<br />* Avoidance of Ethic Questions<br />* Failure to Learn.<br />Sounds simple; yet anyone who has participated in a project recognizes these blunders and traps.  In fact, most of us could supply the author with reams of case studies to add to the ones he uses to illustrate his points.<br />This is a great book and should be read by project managers and corporate managers alike.

Rather, my hope is that it will constitute a `word album' that captures and preserves the raw, unpolished emotional and analytical responses that illustrate how I, and others, felt as we tried to grapple with September 11 and its aftermath.\\"<br />The author deserves the three Pulitzer prizes he has won.  He was early to recognize how the world was transitioning from a cold war system of division to a globalization of nations, markets and individuals stitched together by a single web:  The World Wide Web.<br />Yet as a columnist limited to fewer than 1500 words a week, I often feel deprived.  As Friedman admits, his columns are only \\"the dots\\" of his encounters and travels.  His journal provides the connection between the dots.  Connected, widely-read and highly-respected, there is little doubt the author often influences the events on which he reports.<br />In January, 2002, with the battle largely over, his journal relates how the author traveled to Afghanistan with Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  The day they were to leave, weather forced the cancellation of their UN relief flight.  Friedman quickly used his satellite telephone to link Biden with Secretary of State Colin Powell who quickly arranged for Biden, his staff and Friedman to fly out on a US military C-130 transport jet.<br />In an unconnected incident, the next month he emerged from an interview with the Saudi Royal Family with a peace proposal:  recognition of Israel in return for withdrawal to May 1967 borders.<br />As an indirect shareholder of The New York Times, I must admit I was troubled by two things.  One, many of the meetings Friedman writes about occurred over dinner, a meal I am sure was ultimately paid for by The New York Times.  Second, the author dust jacket picture reveals he is becoming a little flaccid in his face.<br />If I can be so bold as to offer the author advice, it would be to skip the dessert tray at some of these dinners.

Historians will regard the twenty-first century as the time when religion replace ideology as the motivating force in human affairs.<br />The first Reformation marked an end to the status quo in religious affairs; relations between religions and governments, to say nothing of relations between dominations because symbiotic, chaotic and often violent.  The Reformation, and the Counter-Reformation it provoked, touched every manner of life, not just the practice of religion.<br />Christianity, today, is experiencing a worldwide resurgence that coincides with an ebbing of religion in what is now the Christian West.  News reports are filled with incidents demonstrating the growth of an often angry Islam.  Yet in its variety, vitality and reach, the author says, Christianity will leave the deepest mark on this new century.  Only the foolish would venture specific predictions about the nature of the religious picture 100 years from now, but it is certain to have an outsized influence on human affairs, guiding concepts and attitudes of political liberty, the nation state, conflicts and wars.<br />This is a thought provoking book, one that will shake the self-centered beliefs of western readers to their core.	2002-09-05

Delilah was one; Moses sent 12 into Canaan and Abraham Lincoln had none, so he retained the Pinkerton Detective Agency to provide intelligence.  Alfred the Great was so frustrated with the information he was receiving, he disguised himself and went undercover.<br />Today, 16 years after what Kirkus Reviews called \\"perhaps the best book ever written about the business of spies and spying\\" we are being told the September 11th, 2001 attacks resulted from a dearth of \\"assets on the ground.\\"<br />The author, who covered espionage for the London Sunday Times at the time he wrote this book, concludes intelligence agencies are a bureaucrat's dream - they are charged with an unclear mission, financed with undisclosed budgets and employ thousands and accomplish little.  With that much at stake, Knightley argues, the rival agencies may actually connive to keep each other in business.<br />This is a view I doubt we will hear or see explored by today's Senate Intelligence Committee.	2002-08-21

Drucker, writer, lecturer, business philosopher, argues convincingly argues the greatest technological changes of the Information Revolution lie ahead and most of them will have little to do with information.<br />To illustrate, Drucker retreats to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  James Watt improved the steam engine in 1776; it was not until 1785 when the engine was harnessed to an industrial operation - the spinning of cloth, that society appreciated its benefits.  During the following half century, Drucker notes, output increased and the price of cotton textiles fell 90 per cent.<br />In short order the great majority of manufacturing processes were mechanized.  Yet it was not until the 1820s with the adaptation of the steam engine to land based transportation - the railroad - that society witnessed its first new product.  It was without precedent and it transformed the economy, society and politics of its day.<br />The Information Revolution is standing today at the same doorstep where the Industrial Revolution in 1820, Drucker believes.<br />Some of the chapters of the book, which are essays or articles that have been previously published, deal with management topics; some do not.  Although none offers a cure-all, it remains a management book.  The societal and social changes will dominate the executive's thinking for the next 10 to 15 years.  His or her response, Drucker says, may be more important for the success or failure of their organizations than their response to any economic event.	2002-08-05

You throw a multiple book advance at a retired legend; he pockets the money and rehashes a couple of his speeches from the last 25 years and you package them with a trendy, relevant title.  Voila, you have a profitable book.<br />At least the sports writer was honest when he entitled his dip in the publishing money pool, \\"I am back for more cash.\\"<br />The sad fact is there is probably not a better person to address the character issues facing Wall Street today.  Being a full blooded member of the Wall Street Establishment, Mr Bogle understands the concept of \\"ringing the register.\\"  So when he returns, in the words of the sports writer, \\"for more cash,\\" I hope he \\"earns it\\" in the words of deceased Smith Barney spokesperson.<br />A lot has happened since Bogle founded the Vanguard Group in 1974.  As head of the firm, he read proxy statement after proxy statement disclosing increasingly more offensive conflicts of interest and stood idly by or perhaps worse, ignored them.  I would love to know his thoughts on the role of the fiduciary in shareholder democracy.  Or, how about boards of directors who continue to throw good money after bad down the rat holes of stock buybacks?  Why did Vanguard play such a passive role in allowing the accounting profession to price it auditing services as a loss- leader so it could sell more profitable consulting products?<br />Bogle's observations on these trends would more than fill a book on character.  My suggestion to readers is to save your money for Character Counts, The Sequel.  Unlike Hollywood, the remake will have to be better than this sorry book.	2002-07-29

Using the cold war backdrops of 1950s Berlin, 1956 Invasion of Hungry, the Bay of Pigs, 1980s Afghanistan and Gorbachev's overthrow, he spins a tale of Alice in Wonderland espionage, a story of people living double lives in their pursuit of a crafty, resourceful, amoral, elusive and formidable enemy.<br />At one point early in the book, Jack McAuliffe, tells his companion that if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.  This book lays the groundwork for such a premise, but even after 894 pages of justification, I am not sure I question this unconventional wisdom.	2002-07-26

At the height of his influence, he retired and devoted himself to science. Surrounding himself with the most visionary minds of the twentieth century - Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, James Franck, Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi to name a few - in the basement of Tuxedo Park home.<br />During World War II, he mobilized civilian scientists to defeat the enemy and personally bankrolled research that lead to radar detection systems which changed the war's course.<br />Loomis understood science as a dominating force and used his fortune to attract and underwrite gifted practitioners who pushed the envelope of knowledge. Perhaps his life should serve as the model for a Wall Street that today, badly needs to re-invent itself.	2002-07-16

In my mind, although commercial successes, these other novels, failed critically.<br />With Up Country, DeMille demonstrates he has not lost his critical touch.  He melds his emotionally draining experience of a return trip to Viet Nam in 1997 with his successful commercial formula and produces a great novel.  The story is simple.  Paul Brenner,  retired from the army's Criminal Investigation Division and a Viet Nam vet, is asked to return to Viet Nam and investigate an American army lieutenant's death, who authorities suspect may have been murdered three decades ago.<br />DeMille's commercial formula remains the same.  A strong, independent-minded, wise-cracking male falls in love with a self-assured female and together the overcome intrigue, action and adventure.<br />Brenner's emotional journey as he unearths his own painful memories of Viet Nam makes the book worth reading and in my mind, vaults it to critical success.  As the author concludes, a journey home is never direct, but somewhere along the way, we discover that it is more relevant than the destination and the people we meet along its path will be traveling companions in our minds for the rest of our lives.<br />DeMille always relates a great story; this one is worth reading carefully.	2002-07-03

Their book deals with the early stages of the process.<br />It is easy, they say, if readers focus on five critical words: desire, product, people, attempt and discover.<br />Then why is it, to borrow statistics used by Microsoft at their Project 2002 product that 74 per cent of projects in the United States are either behind schedule or fail at a cost to industry of $74 Billion a year?<br />If you watch how people successfully develop systems, the authors say, you will observe that the process of developing requirements is a process of developing a team who:<br />1. Understand the requirements.<br />2. Stay together to work on the project.<br />3. Understand and practice teamwork.<br />The project, the authors say, will probably fail if one of these conditions is not met.  Team members must develop and concentrate on three critical, but often ignored human aspects of the process:<br />1. A clear understanding of the requirements by all members<br />2. A sense of teamwork<br />3. The required skills and tools to work effectively as a team.<br />This conversational book is written to be read in modules or front to back.

Someone steps forward to articulate the pride, hope or grief of it all.  The speaker becomes the center of attention and the world stops to listen.  And on that dreary March day, Lincoln addressed a nation shaken by four years of  horror and sacrifice on both sides.<br />This book's focus is on Lincoln's words, but a larger portrait of the deep, brooding sprit that inspired the words emerges.  The speech paints a portrait of Lincoln agonizing with his struggle for justice and reconciliation for the South.  His seven minute treatise spoke to a nation and to a world that was overwhelmed by death and the issues that lead to the killing by offering hope and judgment.<br />To a time that lacked statesmanship and leadership, his words transcend the time in which they were delivered.  He spoke with a simple conviction that carried healing to his listeners and readers, then and today.<br />Ronald White transforms this speech from one man's struggle with doubt into a promise of hope and redemption for the ages.	2002-06-07

Power in this new century will rest on a mix of what he defines as \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" resources.  The greatest mistake we can make as a world power is to allow ourselves to become the victim of one-dimensional analysis, believing that investment in military power alone with ensure our strength.<br />Paying attention to \\"soft\\" power, the former Chairman of the National Intelligence Council and Assistant Defense Secretary in the Clinton Administration argues, will co-opt people rather than coerce them.  Military and economic power can be used to influence or threaten other people and country's positions once they are taken.  Soft power however, rests on the ability to set the political agenda in a way that shapes preferences.<br />It is the ability to entice and attract.  It stems, in large part, from our values -- the policies we follow inside our country and the way we handle ourselves abroad.  It recognizes that power in the information age is less tangible and coercive.<br />There is also a benefit to not going it alone.  While an inequality of power, he says, has often led to peace, because there is no point in declaring war on a more powerful state, it causes some countries to chafe.<br />Effective global governance requires a powerful state to take the lead.  By encouraging or nourishing regional pockets of strength and acting with restraint or in combination with others, the impact of American power is softened.  Whether other countries unite to balance American power depends as much on how the United States behaves as the power resources of the potential challengers.<br />The key to maintaining American supremacy in the years ahead, Nye argues, will rest in our ability to share power as well as to lead.depends as much on how the United States behaves as the power resources of the potential challengers.<br />The key to maintaining American supremacy in the years ahead, Nye argues, will rest in our ability to share power as well as to lead.	2002-04-19

The successful leader strives and thrives on formulating unique and creative interpretations of them.  The way the most innovative, successful people do this, he says, is to:<br />* Possess an open and absorbent mind.<br />* Understand complexity.<br />* Understand the difference between the expected and the serendipitous.<br />* Recognize details that others do not.<br />For enterprises to be successful, Hoover says, their leaders have to appreciate how historic trends are impacting and will impact their organizations.  For instance, the author notes that the baby boom, the largest single population bulge in United States history, impacts business in different ways as those in the generation age.<br />Hoover suggests transforming your business vision into your enterprise's reason for being.  To be easily communicated to your employees, the vision must be clear, consistent and have a central service focus.  To sustain that vision and reap the harvest of success, the author notes, you will have and demonstrate passion, persistence, energy, self-confidence, an inclination towards action, individuality and leadership.	2002-03-15

Two developments in American Capitalism have contributed to the question's complexity.  First, shareholders have divorced themselves from the corporations operation, leaving the task to professional managers.<br />Second, generally accepted accounting principles do not align expenses with benefits, distorting economic reality.  As a result, investors who want to compare the cash they can take out of a company with the cash they have invested are hampered.<br />The authors argue Economic Value Added (EVA) is a true measure of a company's economic performance, in addition to being a strategy for creating shareholder value.  Properly implemented, they state, EVA frees the measurement of corporate performance from the vagaries of accounting principles and gives both shareholders and management a clear picture of the value the company creates.<br />EVA is the profit that remains after deducting the cost of the capital invested to generate that profit or EVA = Net Operating Profit After-Tax minus capital charge.  Effectively implemented, the tool becomes the basis for an incentive plan that rewards managers for actions that increase shareholder returns and vice versa.<br />John S. Shiely, president of Briggs and Stratton and co-author of the book, notes this strategy provided the foundation of his company's turnaround.  In 1989, the world's largest producer of air-cooled engines had an EVA of negative $62 million based on $1.3 billion in sales.  By re-organizing and focusing its strategy while developing its EVA program, the company staged a dramatic turnaround.  By 1999, it reported a record positive EVA of $50.9 million.  Shareholders, who bought $100 worth of stock at the beginning of the program, saw it increase in value to $673 in 1999.<br />The authors claim EVA is ideal for knowledge-based companies making heavy infrastructure investments today for any anticipated return later.  EVA treats cash outlays that represent investments as capital rather than expenses.  The capital in these knowledge based industries consists of research, development, marketing, advertising and start-up costs.  Accounts view these expenditures as expenses, but it is realistic to capitalize them and amortize them over their useful lives.cash outlays that represent investments as capital rather than expenses.

Freed from decades of debate over the slavery questions, the country unleashed the forces of industrialization and expansion.<br />In the realm of ideas, the civil war also discredited the country's intellectual climate.  It took nearly 50 years for Americans to develop a philosophy that would help them cope with it.  Louis Menand's study of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and John Dewey shows how these four men developed a philosophy of pragmatism following the Civil War.<br />Together these four thinkers, each of them giants in their chosen field, founded in 1874 an informal discussion group in Cambridge, MA called The Metaphysical Club.  Although they met for only nine months, the ideas they discussed became the foundation of the ideas and values that changed the way Americans were to think and live for the next 50 years.<br />This book is an effort to write about those ideas through the personal and social situations of the four individuals who conceived them.	2002-02-25

There is no question that the American work force is undergoing what may be its most significant transformation since the migration from the farm to the factory one century ago.<br />The author spent a year traveling the country talking with hundreds of these workers.  The portrait that emerges is the death of what William H. Whyte, Jr. named \\"the organizational man\\" in his 1956 book of the same name.

Changes in three areas will be required before this migration becomes a powerful demographic influencing the economy and the nation:<br />1. Tax Changes<br />2. Access to Capital Markets<br />3. Attitudes<br />First, amend tax codes have to give the free agent the same status as the business he or she left.  Benefits need full deductibility and ease of implementation.  If the country benefits from independents building businesses, the capital gains tax needs to stop being a political football.  It makes no sense to sacrifice to build a business unless there is a carrot at the end of the trail.  A reduced or no capital gains tax is a powerful inducement.<br />State tax departments need to stop looking at independents as training grounds for their new agents.  I have better things to do with my time than wet-nurse agents-in-training on a fishing expedition.<br />Second, open capital markets to the free agent.  Capital, if available, is expensive for the individual businessperson.  Bank loan officers do not or will not understand the difference between pre-tax and after-tax income.

Suppliers have lost their dominating position to their customers, who refused to accept inconsistent quality, high margins and non-existent service.<br />Information technology, the mid-wife of the new economy, has equipped customers with the tools to comparison shop and shortened product life cycles.  Customers now rule the marketplace.<br />&quot;Suddenly,&quot; writes Michael Hammer in the opening to his fourth book, &quot;business is not so easy anymore.\\"  He then presents an ambitious nine-point plan to right what many businesses are doing wrong, much as he did a decade ago in his bestselling book, Reengineering the Corporation.<br />Although there is little new in his plan, it is comprehensive and revolutionary for business owners and managers:<br />1. Run your business for your customers.<br />2. Add value for your customers by solving problems, not just selling products.<br />3. Ensure your processes create value for your customers.<br />4. Creativity thrives in disciplined, coordinated environments.<br />5. Use data collection to improve, not for accounting.<br />6. Loosen organizational structures.<br />7. Remember your distribution channels are not your customer; the end user is.<br />8. Press your boundaries in pursuit of efficiency.<br />9. Lose your identity to the extended enterprise.<br />These may not be new ideas.  However, the author's detailed case studies provide a reasonable justification for purchasing and reading this book.

I loved the time I used to spend with the reporter dressed in a white suit who spoke with the poet's voice.<br />Unfortunately his battle with the demons of depression has limited the opportunities he allows me to visit.  As the old saw says, \\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\\" and I welcome the opportunity even a collection of short stories affords.  It is not five-star material, but I am grateful for the chance to experience one of America's great journalist's unconventional and outspoken thoughts on our culture.<br />In this collection, Wolfe travels this country, observing \\"the lurid carnival actually taking place in the mightiest country on earth in the year 2000.\\"  He focuses his keen eye and applies his sharp tongue to teenage sexual mores and the new sciences of genetics and neuroscience.  He profiles William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, and Intel founder, Robert Noyce.<br />The stories may be short, but the satire and the observations that made vintage Wolfe a legend, remain honed.  They may not rate five stars, but they offer an opportunity to re-experience a master.	2001-12-28

Finally, the perfect gift for people who wished they paid more attention in high school history class.<br />Brian Lamb, the host of the long running C-SPAN author interview program, Booknotes, has edited interviews with more than 80 historians, writers, journalists and politicians on the great and small events that have shaped American history.  Lamb's original interview questions have been omitted, allowing the author to conversationally describe each event with the passion that is generated only a person who loves his or her work.<br />Among my favorite tales recounted is Robert Frost's reading of \\"The Gift Outright&quot; at the Presidential Inauguration of John F. Kennedy as told by Jay Parini.  President Kennedy, the Middlebury College professor tells us, initially resisted Stewart Udell's attempts to include 86 year old poet fearing he would steal the show.  Events would prove him right.<br />Another favorite is James M. Perry, the long-time political reporter for The Wall Street Journal, discussing Civil War Correspondents.  The demand for timely and accurate dispatches from the front lines transformed American Journalism and provided the antecedents for today's personality-driven electronic Journalism.<br />So if you are sorry you slept through American history class, or if you loved it as much as I did, here is a book for you - an engaging compendium that will provide hours of interesting readings.	2001-12-15

Even if the user does not enter the through it, it generally does not take him or her long to navigate there.  Its function is to communicate the company is and its value.<br />In their private consulting practice, the authors charge $10,000 to perform a usability review.  Knowing that many cannot afford their services, Jakob Nielsen and Marie Tahir distill their consulting experience into 113 guidelines for designing homepages that work for you and your users.  The resulting book is not limited to theory.<br />The second part applies the principles to 50 websites.  Here the reader is confronted with the complications that confront designers.  The big, colorful and nicely printed reproductions of the homepages drive home the points made in the first section in a simple manner.  The negative impact of ignoring the 113 principles is effectively made.<br />The homepage is often the first, and all too often, the last chance to chance to attract and retain your user.  Compared to the $500,000 cost of ordering 50 site reviews, this book is a bargain.  Considering the impact losing even one customer can have on your business, this book is essential.	2001-12-03

Bernstein postulates that mastery of concept of risk is the divide between the past and modern times.<br />The book tells the story of a group of thinkers who struggled to understand risk, measure it and weigh its consequences.  Their work equipped us with the ability to define what may happen in the future and to elect between the alternatives.  Risk management lies at the heart of modern society.<br />It is not that we are less superstitious or more rational than our forefathers, but this group empowered us to make decisions in a rational mode.  Our lives teem with numbers, yet numbers are only tools.  Models rarely lend themselves to reality leading many to worry that our break with the past ushered us into an existence that is as confining and arbitrary as the old.<br />\\"Markets look a lot less efficient from the banks of the Hudson than from the banks of the Charles,\\" Fisher Black, the pioneering financial academic who moved from the Ivory Tower to Wall Street, once said.<br />I was struck by how the dice and the roulette wheel were the laboratory for many of the early quantifications of risk.  The result of gaming naturally lends itself to a mathematical expression.<br />The word \\"risk\\" derives from the early Italian \\"risicare,\\" which the author says means to dare.

It is a book written for thoughtful citizens; a book that, clearly, was not written in a hurry; a book that unearths the struggles, egos and the political maneuvering among the key figures in The White House, the State Department and the military.  Halberstam shows how the decisions of Vietnam War Veterans, like Colin Powell and Anthony Lake, and those who were not, like President William Clinton, influenced American politics and policy.<br />Lesser-known players who contributed to the picture were not overlooked.  Halberstam notes that the irony of the Gulf War was the wrong branch of the service and the wrong military leaders were celebrated at its conclusion.  Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell received ovations for their humiliation of an allegedly mighty, but now bedraggled Iraqi Army.<br />If one man was responsible, he notes, it was an innovative air force strategist, Colonel John Warden.  At the time of the Gulf War, Warden was the head of a top-secret air force group working within The Pentagon and represented a group of younger military officers who were eager to adapt military thinking and planning to the uses of the new technological advanced weaponry.<br />The major opposition to his thinking came not from the army or even civilians, but rather senior officers in his service branch, especially three and four star generals attached to the Tactical Air Command.  They believed the airpower was there to support the army on the ground.  They despised Warden and his ideas.  As luck would have it, when General Schwarzkopf requested an air plan for Desert Storm, Warden's senior officer was on leave and the request found its way to his desk.<br />Roy Gutman, an American reporter who happened to be in Yugoslavia in 1991 and was starting to write what would be a series of prophetic dispatches for Newsday, the Long Island, New York daily, is another unknown player.  Stationed in Belgrade from 1973 to 1975 as a Reuter's correspondent, he had embraced what he termed as \\"the golden age of Tito\\", a Serbo-centrism that tempered the vision of many western diplomats and journalists.<br />On his return in 1991 he saw signs that Yugoslavia was becoming a different country.  An interview with Vojislav Seselj, an ultra nationalist Serb who had once been jailed by Tito for his ethnic views and was known for his personal cruelty, convinced the journalist that something sinister was about to happen with its likely epicenter as Banja Luka, a city in Northern Bosnia, which time which prove to be the home of the Serbian campaign of ethnic cleansing.<br />Halberstam's search for the real story behind the headlines gives the reader clear insights into why events in the Balkans, Haiti and Somalia reflect American foreign policy and politics.  He discusses the wariness of the U. S. military to ever be caught again in a ground war lacing clear objectives, the frustrations of political leaders who never served in the military and their effects on American commanders in Kosovo.<br />On the last page of the book, the author allows himself a glimpse into our future, which in light of the events of September 11, 2001 proves tragically prescient.  Writing in May, 2001, Halberstam, allows himself to speculate about the need for a missile shield, what he terms \\"a high-tech Maginot Line, the wrong idea at the wrong time.\\"  He notes that intelligence analysts believe \\"the threat to an open society like America c[o]mes from terrorists, rather than the military power of rogue states\\" which themselves present an exceptional target.<br />The author has carved a unique niche for himself.  His books are the product of four to five years of research, a luxury few, if any other journalists are indulged.  The emerging portrait of the United States is vivid and full of human detail.n exceptional target.<br />The author has carved a unique niche for himself.

Web Project Management presents a solid Web project management method for building commercial web sites.<br />The book reads as if Ashley Friedlein, the author made many of the same mistakes I made.  The wisdom encapsulated between the covers of this well written, easy-to-understand volume will serve web site project managers for years to come.<br />The author breaks web site construction into 4 distinct phases:  Pre-production, Production, Maintenance and Evaluation.  Pre-production is broken into 3 stages:  Project Clarification, Solution Definition, and Project Specification.  Pre-production ranks as the most important stage; it represents the time when you work out what is to be achieved and plan how you will do it.<br />Production consists of the following stages:  Content, Design and Construction, Testing, Launch and Handover.  I found the author's attention to content complications particularly interesting.  In my experience, content is the area where web site designers and builders are the weakest, yet plays one of the most critical roles in the users' return.<br />Maintenance plays a critical role in the updating and evolution of the site, so that it can retain and grow its user base.<br />The final phase, Evaluation, is something of great importance to site builders and clients.  Clients are demanding their web sites provide a return on investment.  Sites must perform a commercial as well as a branding and marketing function to justify continued investment.  If a financial benefit can be established, it is much easier to receive continued funding for existing projects or to undertake new ones.<br />If you are involved-however tangentially-with web site development and support, you owe it to yourself to have a well-worn copy of this book gracing your bookshelves.  Friedlein writes from experience - and that experience will save you time, money and quite a few headaches.	2001-10-05

It is rare when an author is able to sustain an argument that successfully challenges the work to which I have devoted my recent energies.<br />Yet that is exactly what Cass Sunstein, a University of Chicago Law Professor, does in Republic.com.  With an improving ability to filter everything we wish to see, read and hear Sunstein asks if this is healthy for a democratic based society.  The successful practice of Democracy, he argues, requires an informed citizenry.<br />In the pre-cyberworld, newspapers, magazines and other media outlets performed this function by exposing readers to a varied diet of opinions and ideas.  They created an environment where citizens should share their common values and experiences.  As the traditional media's role as purveyor diminishes and the reader's power to filter unwanted messages improves, society is in danger of fragmenting, shared communities in danger of dissolving. Shrill and extreme versions of our own thoughts and opinions will be sucked into this vacuum, Sunstein argues.<br />While I buy author's argument, I reject his conclusions.  He argues for increased regulation of The Internet.  I respond that more regulation is self-defeating, if the end is a democratic free-society.  Filtering is the inevitable response to the growth of information.  Readers do not have enough time to assimilate all they are asked.  Responsible editors, human in the past, mechanical in the future, will be asked to do what they have always done: prepare and present a balanced view of the reader's world.<br />The Internet will prove to be effective means for preserving and promoting our cherished Democratic Principles.  Citizens, I believe, once aware of filtering potential hazards will take deliberate steps to assure that it does not undermine the institutions and ideas they cherish.	2001-09-24

It simply does not exist.<br />There is no question that there is a direct link between innovation and wealth creation. Using a proprietary database developed by McKinsey &amp; Company to study the life cycle of American corporations, the authors demonstrate, what they term as \\"the corporate equivalent of El Dorado,\\" the company that continually outperforms the stock market does not exist. It is a figment of the \\"one decision\\" crowd that resurfaces with each generation of investors.<br />Capital Markets reward shareholders of competitive corporations and then rapidly, and with no remorse, forget them when they lose their ability to innovate. The McKinsey data show corporations, which operate with management philosophies based on the assumption of continuity, do not change at the pace and scale of the markets. Therefore, in the long run they fail to create value at the pace and scale of the markets.<br />Corporations are premised on continuity; their focus is on operations. Capital Markets are premised on discontinuity; their focus is on creation and destruction. They are less tolerant than the corporation of underperformance. &quot;Blue Chip&quot; corporations earn the right to survive. They have no claim on superior, or for that matter, even average long-term shareholder returns.<br />The reason is simple, the authors conclude. Corporate control processes, the very processes that ensure long-term survival, inure them to the need for change.<br />This is a book every serious investor should read. The message is spiced with case studies of how corporations like Johnson and Johnson, Enron, Corning and GE transform daily themselves rather than opt to incrementally improve operations. Managements need to create new businesses, abandon ingrown rules and structures and be continually adopting new decision-making processes, control systems and mental models.<br />As the book's subtitle suggests, corporations must strive to be as dynamic and responsive as the capital markets if they are to reward investors with long-term superior returns.models.<br />As the book's subtitle suggests, corporations must strive to be as dynamic and responsive as the capital markets if they are to reward investors with long-term superior returns.	2001-09-18

A group of hot bond arbitrage traders joined forces with a pair of future Nobel Prize winning academics to form a hedge fund that promised it had conquered the ogre of risk.  As profits grew, greedy bankers and brokers stood in line to provide financing on the finest of terms.  Yet, like other speculators before them, they failed.<br />The markets, as G. K. Chesterton wrote, lay \\"a trap for logicians . . ..  It looks just a little more mathematical and regular than it is; its exactitude is obvious, but its inexactitude is hidden; its wildness lies in wait.\\"<br />While the hedge fund's history is familiar, Lowenstein's conclusions are worthy of examination by both historians and investors.<br />1. Long-Term Capital Management's (LTCM) profits look less impressive in light of the losses that followed.  The \\"profits\\" used by bankers and brokers to justify their loans and investments in the fund were not \\"earned\\", merely borrowed against the day the tide turned.<br />2. LTCM saw the cycle was turning, yet refused to limit its exposure.  As spreads markets withered, the partners opted to increase their leverage to maintain returns.<br />3. The fund had faith in diversification.  Its history serves as ample notification that eggs in different baskets can and do all break at the same time.<br />4. One can be big - read illiquid; one can be leveraged, but to be both is begging for trouble.  No one can be right every trading day.<br />5. Traders are not computer chips.  They are motivated by emotions; they run in herds, they retreat in hordes. Uncertainty will never conform itself to a numeric straitjacket despite the risk defining desires of the academic community.<br />This book tells a timeless tale.  Markets are cunning animals, there to exploit investors' mistakes and hubris.	2001-07-17

Economists and investment analysts may debate what is new about the \\"New Economy\\", but one thing remains clear, intangible assets are assuming a critical role in the creation of wealth.<br />Non-physical sources of value, intangible assets are generated by innovation, unique organizations and human resource practices.  This asset class often interacts with tangible and financial assets to create shareholder value and stimulate economic growth.  Yet they remain conspicuously absent from required disclosures.<br />Baruch Lev argues in this book that his lack of public information results in improved management of corporate assets contributes to a higher cost of capital and affords abnormally large gains to insiders at the expense of outside investors.  To level the playing field, Lev proposes companies periodically release, in addition to the required income, balance sheet and cash flow statements, quantitative and standardized information most relevant to the company value chain or business model.<br />Specifically, he would require three classes of timely disclosure on what he calls the innovative and successful company's lifeline:  Discovery and Learning, Implementation and Commercialization.  Under Discovery and Learning, he would require disclosure of internal renewal, acquired capabilities and networks.  For Implementation, required disclosures would include intellectual property, technological feasibility and Internet metrics.  For Commercialization, required disclosures would include data on customers, performance and growth prospects.<br />These disclosures will transform the accounting profession from one that is essentially backward looking - how much was sold at what cost - to a forward looking - the creation of value enhancing assets.  This recognizes that in the current knowledge-based economy, value creation or destruction precedes transactions, often by years.<br />Lev's proposed disclosures would compliment current disclosures, providing a reality check on the system of value creation or destruction as products, services and processes move along the value chain.ions, often by years.<br />Lev's proposed disclosures would compliment current disclosures, providing a reality check on the system of value creation or destruction as products, services and processes move along the value chain.	2001-07-11

Visualizing Project Management succeeds where many have failed.<br />The book focuses on the five common elements of every successful project: a common vocabulary, teamwork, a plan, leadership and management.<br />Starting with the project requirements, it details the correct way to plan, schedule and control projects.  These elements do not naturally occur, particularly in complex technical projects.  The techniques and tools presented are applicable throughout the project lifecycle.<br />The book is full of illustrations, which clarify the techniques being discussed.  The best idea I found book was the Cards on the Wall technique, which calls for each team member to attach each WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) to a wall and interconnect the dependencies with yarn.  The resulting interaction, I found, encourages group thinking and project buy-in, while anticipating the unanticipated.<br />There is also a great section on Earned Value, a powerful and effective tool for the early detection of slippages and cost overruns.  As the authors correctly note, \\"If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.\\"<br />Aspiring project managers and executives responsible for supervising it in their organizations should read this book.  It will help them successfully understand and apply the project management process in their pursuit of \\"better, faster, and cheaper.\\"	2001-07-06

Edward Chancellor book arrives at the same conclusion but provides more foundation to recognize the bubbles of speculation.<br />Investment bubbles never change.  Yet, for the investor or trader caught up in one, they remain difficult to identify.  According to modern economic theory, markets are efficient and speculators are rational opportunists intent on maximizing their wealth.<br />Chancellor, a former investment banker and historian, disagrees.  More than fear and greed drives speculators, they motivated by deeper compulsions and aspirations.  Speculation, he says, can only be understood within a social context and that its history cannot be a simple description of economic affairs.  It is important to understand the behavior and attitudes of politicians, since the laws governing markets are written and enforced by governments.<br />He traces the origins of speculative fever back to ancient Rome and follows the thread through Holland's tulip mania in the 1630s and London's stockjobbers 70 years later.<br />The book ends with an insightful analysis of the Junk Bond era here in the United States, the Japanese bubble and the near collapse of Long Term Capital Management.  It is a must read for every serious investor.	2001-06-29

Write a book that posits a common explanation for human history and biological evolution. To add controversy, throw in a chapter that offers God as an author supplying orchestration to a human march towards destiny.<br />The result is a highly readable, highly contentious and highly thought provoking book.<br />Wright looks to game theory to supply the explanation. All interactions, he argues, whether they are between genes, cells, animals, interest groups, corporations or nations can be viewed through the lense of game theory or what he calls a non-zero-sum game. Thus one player's gain need not be bad news for the other players, since all their interests overlap. It illustrates, he says, the dynamic that shapes the unfolding of life on earth.<br />Then in 22 chapters the author applies his thesis. The survey of organic history is brief; the survey of human history, not so brief. Wright posits that human history is marked by repetitive patterns. New technologies, he says, emerge that permit or encourage new methods of non-zero-sum interactions. New social structures evolve to convert these interactions into positive sums, thus increasing the depth and scope of social complexity.<br />It is not a smooth path. Quite the contrary, it is often turbulent. Biological evolution and human history pass through what the author refers to as &quot;thresholds&quot; or periods marked by an unsettling, out-of control feeling that portends a major shift to a higher-level equilibrium.<br />Here Wright enters a speculative argument for the existence of a God, a cosmic author with a grand purpose for history and evolution.<br />One thing is clear, Wright concludes. This is our story and we will not escape it.	2001-06-28

Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, conservative, radical and evangelical viewpoints are all represented in the signed entries.  A bibliography follows each essay and cross-references lead from one topic to another.  Controversial topics are dealt with in a balanced fashion.<br />I have two problems with the book.  First, I am easily distracted when I use it.  This is more my problem than the editors'.  When I consult this volume I have a specific topic or question I want answered.  The interesting and provocative nature of the entries often leads me far astray from the question I want answered.  It is the same problem I have with Study Bibles.  I become so enmeshed in the commentary; I lose sight of the verse or topic I want to research.<br />Second, graphically each page is a vast sea of gray.  There are no illustrations, pictures or white space to visually break up the entries.  If the content were not so stimulating, you would never pick up the book.<br />Despite my reservations, this is a great addition to any Christian's library.  If it were not for the graphics, it would deserve five stars.	2001-06-27

Since it was published in 1923, generations of investors have found its trading advice rings true.<br />The fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore, one of the greatest stock market speculators, it contains perceptive trading advice and insightful analyses of market price movements.<br />\\"I learned early that there is nothing new in Wall Street,\\" states the book's protagonist, Larry Livingstone.  \\"There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills.  Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again.\\"<br />During the 1970's when this book was out of print, my friends and I would scrounge used bookshops in searching of copies of this gem.  The reason:  its pages contain precious pearls of wisdom with which experienced traders can identify, from which new traders can learn.  Thankfully, this generation of traders will not have to go to the lengths mine did to access this wisdom.<br />\\"I did precisely the wrong thing,\\" Livingstone notes.  \\"The cotton showed me a loss and I kept it.  The wheat showed me a profit and I sold it out.  Of all the speculative blunders there are few greater than trying to average a losing game.  Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit.\\"<br />Livermore made and lost millions playing the stock and commodity markets.  LeFevre, a journalist captures many of his timeless lessons in this book, which first appeared as a series in The Saturday Evening Post.  There is, however, one Wall Street Pearl that did not make the book - \\"a speculator who dies rich, is a speculator who dies before his time.\\"  Livermore committed suicide in a bathroom of the Pierre Hotel and died a penniless man.	2001-06-26

It finds itself basking in a success unrivaled by history's greatest empires.  In popular culture, finance, weaponry, science, technology and education, the country dominates the worldview.  The country considers itself both the source and the guarantor of global democratic institutions.<br />Yet, Kissinger argues, the United States finds itself at a juncture with irrelevance to many of the issues affecting and changing the world order.  Interest in foreign affairs, he notes judging from media coverage and congressional sentiment, is at an all time low.  As a result the United States finds itself facing some of the most profound and widespread upheavals the world has ever witnessed, yet unwilling and uninterested in developing concepts relevant to the foreign policy reality.<br />Our relations with Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East require subtle responses rendering the traditional American quest for an all-purpose, magic foreign relations formula irrelevant.  Unfortunately, the former Secretary of State argues, three forces in domestic politics drives American foreign policy in the opposite direction.<br />First, Congress legislates the tactics of foreign policy and seeks to impose a code of conduct on other nations by sanction.  These legislative actions drive American foreign policy towards a unilateral and, what Kissinger describes as, occasionally bullying conduct.<br />Second, coverage of these events by a ratings-driven media does not help.  Their obsession with the crisis of the moment rarely fosters discussion of the long-range historical challenges.  They prefer to portray today's crisis as a morality play with a specific outcome and then move on to the next new sensation.  Even though the underlying trends continue, growing in their unmanageability on a daily basis, they receive little attention.<br />Finally, the deepest reason for America's failure to develop a coherent strategy is the presence of three different generations, each with its own approach to foreign relations dominate the foreign policy debate - the Cold Warriors, Vietnam Protestors and Generation X, whose experience makes it hard for them to understand the perceptions of the previous two.<br />The inability of these three groups to articulate an unapologetic statement of enlightened self-interest results in what Kissinger refers to as \\"Progressive Paralysis.\\"  Certainly the country must fashion a foreign policy consistent with its democratic heritage and concerned with the democracy's world wide vitality, he writes, but it must also translate these values into answers to difficult questions: What, for our survival, must we seek to prevent no matter how painful the means?  What wrongs is it essential to right?

Berkeley, among others, and his World's Religions serves as the standard introductory textbook for college religion courses Smith is in a unique position to pass judgment.  Human beings, he posits, have allowed themselves to become so obsessed with the answer to life's fundamental questions that they have written science a blank check for what constitutes knowledge and justified belief.  As a result the world is experiencing a spiritual crisis.<br />The culprit is not science.  We have constructed a worldview tunneled by scientism, higher education, the media and law.  As Smith looks to the future, he sees \\"the light at the end of the tunnel\\" - a time when science and religion peacefully co-exist.  While acknowledging the science's importance, human beings ultimately flourish, he argues, when they seek the answers to life's ultimate questions -- What is the meaning of life?  Why do pain and death exist?  What is reality?<br />Religion recognizes the gulf between these questions and their answers.  Humans being never waiver in their conviction that these questions have answers, religion motivates them to continually seek the answers.<br />I liked the book.  The author states his case in a simple, direct manner.  Style questions, such as whether Smith quotes from other authors are too long or not, are not important to me.  Smith makes his case in a witty, personable and, in my opinion, persuasive manner.	2001-06-08

James W. Cortada argues in this well-written and easily understood book the coporation's customer focal points, sales and marketing departments, must play a lead role if the effort is to be successful.<br />Assuming the reader neither wants, nor needs, a primer on salesmanship or basic customer-oriented marketing, Cortada dispenses practical, realistic and sage advice for the executive attempting to implement a quality strategy within his marketing and sales departments.<br />If thre is a loud message in the book, it is change must begin immediately.  The customers demand it and are willing to pay a premium for it.  Balancing TQM marketing theory and tactical advice while avoiding long strings of war stories, the author guides the reader through and around many of the pitfalls leading to increased customer loyalty and repeat business -- the twin goals of any marketing organization.<br />Cortada suggests the quality journey begins by using the twin beacons of customer satisfaction and cycle-time reduction to look at four elements of the practitioner's sales and marketing effort -- measurements, organization, compensation and education.  Although inwardly directed, they provide an opportunity to shake-down his or her quality drive before tackling the more difficult external issues.<br />No matter how well conceived, the author warns, the drive will be resisted.  Initially, the measurements are a step to alter the behavior of your organization, he says, and will be replaced with others tied to the tactical concerns of customers.  Organizational and compensation changes are required to realign resources with the new vision.  Education lubricates these wheels of change.<br />Cortada suggest forming councils of customers and peers to trade experiences and to benchmark progress.  Their support, he suggests, is vital during early stages when most employees have doubts and are insecure about what does not initially resemble old-fashioned salesmanship.<br />&quot;They...,&quot; concludes Cortada, &quot;provide sales management with a wonderful reaffirmation of what we have always known: that the customer is king and the king wants quality.&quot;gest forming councils of customers and peers to trade experiences and to benchmark progress.

In the business that means they will be responsible for producing a level of customer satisfaction high enough to produce sales generating enough cash flow to cover project and operating expenses, make a profit and pay back the cost of capital used to produce the product.  Only at this point will the project produce enough economic value to enhance shareholder value.<br />To accomplish this, project managers will require new skills.  They will rely not only on traditionally operational skills, but also knowledge of the enterprise's: 1. Accounting and Finance 2. Organizational Strategy 3. Marketing and Value Propositions 4. Human Relations 5. Internal Processes.<br />This will require, the authors say, a radical change in the measurement and control systems of most organizations.  For project managers to act as CEOs, they will have to be treated as CEOs.  They will have to be judged not only by detailed assessments of their project outcomes, durations and costs but by new metrics based on increases in shareholder or stakeholder value.<br />If the authors are correct, the Project Manager's maxim of \\"Make it fast.
