The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because other than Emma Holly, Angela Knight writes the BEST sex scenes.  While other romance novelists' sex scenes make you giggle because they are so ludicrous and horridly written, Knight's scenes just flow.  This book was no exception. <br /> <br />However, I thought this book really suffered from the short-story format.  Also, I think the back cover was deceptive because it gave the impression that this was a full-length novel.  The futuristic world Knight has created, including \\"cyber\\" humans with super-human strength, was really unique and interesting.  A full-length novel would have given her more opportunity to flesh that aspect of the story.  I would have especially loved more developed coverage of Cassidy's story.  What fun to be so strong that you can kick the average man's butt with one hand tied behind your back!   <br /> <br />So there was little meat (no pun intended!)to these stories, which was unfortunate, because I know this author is capable of much more.	2005-09-20

I must admit that every book since those first two has been a disappointment.  Finally, One Night of Sin recaptures some of the originality and depth of those first two.  I was surprised, but not upset, by what seemed like much more graphic sex and violence.   <br /> <br />My only criticism is that, from the very beginning, Alec seemed a little too self-aware.  He demonstrated an emotional insight that was clearly 20th Century, from understanding how his mother's abandonment scarred him and affected his relationships with women, to being aware that his life lacked meaning and that saving Becky would help him regain his self-esteem.  Not very credible.  It would have been more interesting and satisfying for him to reach that understanding, with Becky's help, more slowly. <br /> <br />Otherwise, a very entertaining read.  I hope this signals that Ms. Foley is back on track!	2005-07-17

I'm astounded at the rave reviews of this poorly written, poorly plotted, sorry excuse for erotica.  I read Marly's Choice, was disappointed by the anti-climactic plot and sophomoric writing, but I decided to give Lora Leigh another chance.  I foolishly hoped that her writing would improve.  To the contrary, her writing has actually worsened.  Her phrasing is awkward and self-conscious.  She's obviously trying to write in what she believes is a literary style, but doesn't pull it off.  One example among hundreds:  Marly claims to \\"love Cade so much sometimes I think my soul will shatter.\\"  Huh?  Sounds dramatic but what the hell does it mean?  How does a soul shatter, anyway?  Also her dialogue, especially between Sarah and Brock, was mind-numbingly repetitious.  Sarah: \\"I won't be shared.\\"  Brock: \\"Give me a chance to explain.\\"  Back and forth, over and over and over.....AARGH!!!! <br /> <br />But I might have been able to stand all that (okay, probably not) if the central plot hadn't been so absolutely, laughingly nutty.  The August brothers were raised by a sadistic dad, who \\"loaned\\" them to a neighboring ranch, where they were repeatedly physically threatened into performing sex acts with each other.  Although they were extremely turned off by having sex with each other, somehow they learned that if they embraced it, they could get through it easier.  Then, after they escaped the abuse, they discovered that the only way to deal with their sense of shame was to bring home a woman for them to have sex with together.  By having group sex, the brothers \\"bond\\" and \\"heal.\\"  So, of course, any woman who enters a relationship with any of the brothers must agree to be \\"shared\\" with the other brothers and engage in group sex with the brothers.  What hogwash.  Don't get me wrong.  Group sex, anal sex, woman/woman and man/man sex is fine by me.  Creative sex can be very healthy and is, of course, the stuff of which erotica is made.  I guess that's my problem with this story.  It essentially betrays the central theme of erotica: that experimental sex is normal and healthy, if performed among consenting adults.  The brothers in this story, however, aren't coming from a healthy place at all.  Erotica here is defined as \\"kinky\\" or even \\"deviant\\" sex that the brothers engage because they have to in order to save their sanity.  In other words, the author feels she has to justify their sexual practices.  But the brothers' sexual proclivities shouldn't need to be explained or justified at all.  Another annoying feature is that the author bends over backwards to make it clear that these brothers ARE NOT HOMOSEXUALS, and do not enjoy having sex with other men.  As if she's afraid that any homosexual or even homo-erotic tone would scare readers off.  So the result is this watered down, erotica wannabe. <br /> <br />I won't even bother addressing the silly and unnecessary subplot of the stalker who is after the brothers and the women they love.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.	2005-04-29

I'm sorry, but given what a magnificent character Adam has been in previous books, I expected much more from this one, where Adam is the central character.  To be fair, previously Adam has been this \\"larger than life\\" character, and perhaps no book could do him justice.  However, this book clearly fell short of the mark.  His background, his \\"life\\" story and his character motivation were hardly fleshed out at all.  We're given brief, very unsatisfying \\"glimpses\\" into his past. As a result, we're left not really understanding what makes Adam tick.  As a consequence, his lightning-quick decision to give up immortality to be with Gabrielle rings false. <br /> <br />Also, the laws of Moning's world of the Fae isn't clearly drawn, and is making less and less sense.  Sure, this is all make-believe, but it should still be logical.  The whole issue of Adam not having a soul, but then mysteriously acquiring one, presumably because Gabby wished for it hard enough....simply silly.	2005-04-20

Now, everything about Davenport's life is dull, dull, dull.  At work, he's become a \\"step-n-fetchit\\" to the politicos.  He's not in charge, and he's really not detecting, either.  He's \\"interfacing\\" and \\"facilitating.\\"  Yawn!!! His home life is dullsville, too.  His relationship with Weather, which used to be dynamic and multidimensional, has been reduced to them uttering one-liners to each other as they pass like ships in the night.  Curiously, neither Lucas nor Weather demonstrate any excitement or involvement in the life of the newborn son.  There are no scenes of Lucas holding, feeding, changing, talking to or even thinking of his son, whom he refers to as \\"the kid.\\"  Lucas is out of town for a week and yet the only time he calls Weather, it's to talk about the case, and he never asks about and she never mentions their child.  Very disturbing. <br /> <br />Unlike some reviewers, I don't need the gory, beat-em-up Prey novels of the past.  What I need, and what the book sorely lacks, is insight into Lucas as a human being.  And if Sandford can't find it in him to provide that, he should end the series, in my humble opinion.	2005-02-21

I've loved them all, except her last two efforts, this book and the one before it.  Both books are almost identical in key plot elements: one major plot and three subplots (and therefore far too many characters), lots of class warfare, and largely unsympathetic characters.  PLEASE do not have a hero and heroine from different classes, if all they're going to do is whine incessantly about how their different stations must keep them apart.  I found Stephen's vanity and arrogance about his class superiority appalling.  There was nothing at all heroic about him.  And, I'm sorry, but he didn't all of a sudden become heroic simply because of the way he came to Anne's rescue at the very end.  Not only was Stephen vain, but he had no integrity.  He went on and on about how he was too proud to work for a living, too proud to let Anne support him through her spa, but was not too proud to marry Felicity for her fortune!  The distinction of course is that Anne would have control of her money but, by law, he would control Felicity's fortune.  He was, simply put, disgusting.  Anne deserved so much better. With the exception of Kate, I found all of the characters in this book dispicable, self-pitying and annoying.  I am sorry that I paid for this book.  I think from now on I'm going to check Holt's books out at the library.  She's no longer worth the money.	2004-12-10

This author accomplished what I would have thought was impossible: creating six of the most unappealing, annoying, unsympathetic, whining, hand-wringing, self-pitying characters you will ever meet.  I couldn't stand any of them.  Olivia was the worst type of heroine: she was incredibly weak-minded, had no ambition about anything, just sat around letting life happen to her, then had the nerve to moan when life didn't \\"happen\\" as she wanted.  She acted as if she had absolutely no control over  her life.  Oddly, the hero, Phillip, and the two supporting characters, Winnie and the Earl, were equally helpless and ineffectual.  They all just sat around wringing their hands, acting like martyrs.  Aargh!!!  I could not respect these people; I could only despise them. <br /> <br />Reluctantly, the only character I had a smidgen of respect for was Margaret, the manipulative, evil, hateful antagonist. But at least she DID SOMETHING to fix their situation.     <br /> <br />This book's other major failing was overuse of the characters-never-opening-their mouths-to-share-critical-information-with-each-other as a plot device.  I HATE, HATE, HATE when authors do this, because it shows a total lack of creativity.  If any of these stupid people had even once had a frank conversation with any of the others, the book would have been half as long.	2004-11-29

I'll start by confessing that I AM NOT a Lori Foster fan, and I always think hers are the weakest stories in the Bad Boys anthologies.  This book was no different.  The sad thing about Foster is that her short stories are actually better than her full novels.  I also thought Morgan Leigh's \\"Last Call\\" was incredibly stupid, with an awful plot and boring characters.  Erin McCarthy was the best of the lot.  No, it was not great literature, but at least her characters were compelling.  Bottom line: I'm glad I checked this one out at the library.	2004-11-25

Because Eve Dallas is such a \\"kick ass\\" heroine, I want to like these books.  But I find them boring and uninspiring.  When the story focuses on Eve grappling with her past, it's interesting.  But the other elements -- the futuristic sci-fi, the mystery/thriller and supporting characters -- fall flat.  This particular book's plot was not good.  First, I knew how the victims were being killed, and who the killer was, about a quarter of the way through the book.  And I'm no rocket scientist.  So the fact that it took Eve another 100 pages to figure it out was not inspiring.  Second, the killer is using \\"virtual reality\\" technology to control the victims' minds.  But the author spends absolutely no time explaining how this is scientifically possible.  How does the brain work?  What is the science behind subliminal messages?  The author explains none of this, using the cop out (no pun intended) that Eve is a cop and not a scientist.  Yet the experts that Eve consults speak in such vague generalizations, it's clear that it is the author who is in above her head.   <br /> <br />Another distracting aspect of these novels is that the future described by the author (2058) clearly will not actually exist in 2058.  The author significantly overestimated how quickly technology would advance.  Fifty years from now, we're NOT going to have a comprehensive auto freeway system in the sky, food replicators, extremely advanced robots that appear convincingly human. We might have one of those, but not all.  Again, this just underscores that sci fi is not this author's strong point. <br /> <br />In short, everything about these books seems so dated: the future that seems a rip off of Blade Runner; the retro romance plot (poor girl marries gorgeous billionaire who makes his money in vague business ventures and just wants to take care of said poor girl).Don't think I can read any more of these.	2004-11-25

In what I find a troubling trend in the romance book industry, this author took what should have been a 50-75 page short story, and shamelessly stretched it into a full-length book by repeating the same character thoughts over and over and making the print larger. All so the publisher could rip off readers by selling for $11.00 what was worth no more than $5.   <br /> <br />Donna Kauffman has written some good short stories and books.  This is not one of them.  The plot is stupid, insulting and completely unbelievable.  Not a single aspect of this story would appeal to a woman of the 21st Century.  The characters were atrocious. Was I supposed to believe super-rich, super beautiful Darby would for one minute agree to be waxed, plucked and otherwise bullied by The Glass Slipper's glamour nazis? Was I supposed to like the fact that she was so shallow, she actually felt insecure about the fact that she preferred cowboy boots and jeans to high heels and dresses? Was I supposed to feel sorry for \\"poor-me-I-have-such-a-burden-to-bear\\" Shane?  Was I supposed to find his self-absorbed, narcissistic character appealing? <br /> <br />The plot was also atrocious.  It went from dumb to dumber.  When it turned out that ditsy, airhead Pepper was a secret agent, I finally gave up and stopped reading.  I don't care how Darby and Shane resolve their superficial relationship issues.  Or how they foiled Stefan the robot.  The only good thing about reading this book is that I didn't pay for it; I checked it out at my local library for free.	2004-09-29

I wish romance authors would stop writing their novels in \\"series.\\"  Inevitably, each book in the series is worse than the one preceding it.  That's certainly the case here.  Rocket and Victoria are drawn in a very sketchy fashion.  The result is that neither is very likable.  The secondary characters of Jared and P.J. were given much more depth and, therefore, were much more interesting and sympathetic. <br /> <br />The plot was sketchy also.  Such a big deal was made of Rocket's P.I. abilities.  But he spent almost no time sleuthing, and most of his time gnashing his teeth over his fear of commitment to Tori.  The main plot point of the story is that Rocket has a daughter he never knew he had. But there are almost no scenes with him and Esme.  Such scenes would have been given invaluable insight into Rocket's character development. <br /> <br />On another note: maybe it's just me, but I hate contemporary romance heroines who have children, but never seem to spend any time with them.  I presume Tori works at home so she can spend time with her daughter Esme; yet, there's only one scene with them together.  The rest of the time Esme's either with her friend or her nanny.  Also, there's no mention of school, even though Esme's 5-1/2 years old.  It's details like these that were sorely missing from this novel.  <br /> <br />To put it bluntly: there was no \\"there\\" there.  The author set up a lot of good, potential plot points, but just didn't follow through on any of them.  The result was a very shallow effort by an author who can do much better.	2004-09-20

I think the authors in this series deserve much praise for conceiving an incredible sci-fi plot.  This author and Susan Grant did a great job explaining how the world has changed politically in 176 years.  The notion that the U.S. has lost its way and forgotten its core founding principles, and that perhaps a fighter pilot from 176 years in the past is needed to remind the UCE what America stood for...it gives me shivers.  Well done.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, so far the authors have not done as well explaining the rest of 2176.  I got no sense of what this new world is like on a day-to-day level.  What to do the people wear, eat, what music do they listen to, how have morals and the culture changed?  Think how much people's morals, culture, music and dress changed between 1800 and 1900, and between 1900 and 2000.  To me, that's what makes science fiction so fascinating: theorizing about what people will be like in the future, not just how world political dynamics change. Other than obligatory references to advanced technology, I would have thought this book took place in 2004, not 2176. <br /> <br />Also, I haven't found the romance aspects of these two books very satisfying, either.  I've seen other reviews' references to chemistry between Lian and Day, but I found their relationship rather uninspiring.  I mean, the author told us they felt passion, but seemed to describe their love scenes in a mechanical, unemotional way.  The love scenes read like an instructions manual.  Also, these two characters were so robot-like in their interactions: now we make love outside, now we make love inside, now we get back to work. No spontaneity at all.  Boring!!! <br /> <br />Anyway, I'll keep reading the books in this series because I'm fascinated to see how everything turns out.  I just hope the main characters get more exciting.	2004-09-14

Although I would actually rate this book 3-1/2 stars, I'm quite surprised by the unqualified rave reviews.  Don't get me wrong: I've read almost every short story Angela Knight has written, and I've loved them all.  Whenever she's been featured in one of the Secrets anthologies, I've always thought hers was the best story.  I've loved her inventive plots and sizzling sex scenes.  So perhaps my expectations regarding her full-length novel were just too high.  This effort read like a short story stretched out to make it 300 pages.  The plot initially moved along far too quickly, with the hero and heroine falling into bed by page 10.  There was very little character development, especially regarding Jane.  All we knew about her was that she had an abusive father and a mother who disappeared.  We were told nothing else of significance about her, even though each of these subjects could have been plumbed in a very satisfying way.  The same with Druas: we're given scintillating tidbits about his past, with no follow-through.  And his future world is barely explained.  This fleshing out of details is what turns a short story into a full-length novel. <br /> <br />Also, although other reviewers were impressed by the time travel theories offered here, I was not.  They, quite frankly, made no sense.  I'm by no means a quantum physics expert, but I found the basic premise (a bad guy traveling back in time to recreate crimes he initially committed in the first place (huh?) to be flawed.  If going back in time and committing an act that wasn't meant to be committed (whatever that means) creates a paradox that destroys the universe, then why didn't Druas create such a paradox the first time he went back in time and committed the murders that came to be attributed to \\"Jack the Ripper\\"?  Also, since Druas, by living in the future, already knew what would happen in the past, wouldn't he have anticipated every step Baran and Jane would make against him, and be able to avoid them in perpetuity?  Regardless of the answers to these questions, the fact that I had them in the first place distracted from the plot.  Yes, the sex scenes were hot, but because the characters were so shallowly drawn, they didn't have the extra sizzle they could have. <br /> <br />In short, I was disappointed. But, because I think this author has such promise I will continue to read her full-length efforts, hoping for improvement.	2004-08-20

Except for lots of pizza dinners between the characters.  I had thought this book would be solely about Arcadia, whose story I thought was a logical sequel to Light in Shadow.  Instead, it was an epilogue, with more blathering on and on about how Ethan and Zoe (surprise, surprise!) still haven't trusted each other enough to share their inner-most secrets after a whopping 6 weeks of marriage.

This book was such a disappointment, and I'm beginning to suspect that Ms. McKenna was a one-hit wonder. Her full-length-novel debut, Behind Closed Doors, was absolutely sensational, even if her alpha male hero was a bit overdone. Her next effort, Standing in the Shadows, was mainly a rewrite of the first book, with the main characters' names changed. It had the same villain, same plot, same schizophrenic, insecure hero, and insecure, wimpy heroine. But at least the second book had a plot that made sense. Return to Me has only the weaknesses of her first two books (schizophrenic hero, wimpy heroine, etc.) but none of the plot strengths. The plot, in fact, made almost no sense. The main characters were incredibly two-dimensional and, therefore, extremely irritating. Simon was the small town bad boy who was essentially run out of town when falsely accused of burning down a barn. After seventeen years of serving in the Marines and working as a photojournalist in some of the world's hell holes (Bosnia and Afghanistan), you'd think he'd have gained some perspective, and gotten over his past (which really didn't seem that bad to me). Alas, Simon seems only to have gained an even more bleak, self-absorbed conviction that he is some sort of bad luck charm who can only wreak havoc on his hometown upon his return. It's really quite pathetic, and the fact that he's gorgeous and has a great bod and is generous in the oral sex department doesn't help make him appealing. He's quite pitiful really, and the only thing more pitiful is watching Ellen attempt to help him get over himself. Why does she bother? is what I kept asking, over and over. <br />  <br /> Also, we get no sense of who Ellen is, and how she got there. She's a pushover, but we don't know why. She's never stepped foot out of their hometown, but we don't know why. Also, she's never read a single one of Simon's famous pieces on Bosnia or Afghanistan, but we don't know why. Does this woman never read magazines? She's supposedly compared every man she's met for the past seventeen years to Simon, but she's never discovered that he was an award-winning photojournalist? Even her mother is painted inconsistently: at first she's an overbearing bitch to Ellen, then she's all nice and accepting of Simon, for no good reason. These are the types of details that are consistently missing from Ms. McKenna's books. This was essentially a Harlequin-esque romance novel that should have been 200 pages, but was stretched to twice that length with extra sex scenes, and extra Simon-feeling-sorry-for-himself scenes. I'm getting the sense that Ms. McKenna's strength is writing short stories like those found in the Bad Boy series. If she's going to continue writing full-length novels, I hope she takes more time to conceive and flesh out more interesting plots and characters.  <br /> <br />Inexplicably, I found the characters of Cora and Brad to be the most interesting and best written.  Unlike Ellen and Simon, you got a good sense of who they were in their pasts, why they made the mistakes they did, and how they're trying to change.  That's why, unlike Ellen and Simon, you find yourself rooting for them, and hoping that things work out for them. <br /> <br />One last thing: like many of other reviewers, I thought the sex scenes were hot.  But, I'm getting tired of the author's hero's bull-in-a-china-closet approach to sex.  Would it kill them to use some finesse once in a while?  Does sex with these guys always have to be a full-on assault?  And must the heroes in her books talk so much during sex?  It was actually quite distracting, and detracted from the affect in my opinion.  I kept hoping Simon would just shut up, already.  <br /> <br />My advice: buy this one used or, better yet, check it out at the library for free.	2004-07-28

The characters were, through 90% of the book, so shallowly drawn as to be almost completely cliched and unsympathetic.  Although, with only 20 pages left, Jacinda and Billy finally show some depth of character, it was too late.  By then, I had resorted to skimming to get through this boring book.  Jacinda, a pampered princess who finally sees the light in the last 50 pages of the book, was childish and annoying.  I think I'm going to stop reading historical novels whose heroines are under 21 years of age.  I just can't stand the immaturity.  Billy Blade, although slightly more interesting, was so sketchily drawn thoughout most of the book that he just seemed like a self-pitying, vain peacock.  After he resumes his life in high society, the new Lord William spends more time chasing down his former hoodlum enemies in a petty fit of vengeance, instead of helping the poor that he supposedly came to care so much about.  And throwing in the Lizzie and Alec subplots (in a thinly veiled effort to set up future books) was distracting.  I'm very sorry I paid money for this book.  I will definitely make sure that, in the future, I borrow this author's books from the library, for free.	2004-05-22

I was disappointed by the thin plot line, lack of depth in the characters, and the repetitive prose (if Liam referred to Ellen as an &quot;angel&quot; one more time, I was going to scream).  Although there was adequate background on Ellen, we never really understood what made Liam tick.  The author repeatedly referred to the fact that he was a soldier, as if that completely explained who he was. This is so different from this author's &quot;Regent Street&quot; series, where her male characters are described very thoroughly and eloquently. I hope the next books in the series will improve.	2004-04-28

I don't know how long Ms. Kenyon has been writing, but she needs a lot of improvement.  Yes, she has come up with a novel, engaging fantasy world. But it is as if she used up all of her creative energy in the conceiving.  As with the second book, I feel as if she is making this stuff up as she goes.  The result is a confusing hodgepodge of characters who seem very comic-book like.  This author is particularly inept at writing dialogue (there wasn't a single line of dialogue that would have come out of a real person's mouth) and fight scenes.  Essentially, every male in this book is complete comic book caricature: tall, gorgeous and [tough] with too much attitude.  They were all too busy spouting one-liners to say anything intelligent or compelling.  <br />On top of that, the Talon/Sunshine love story was not the least bit compelling.  I have no idea why the issue of reincarnation was placed in this story, because it completely killed the little romantic potential that already existed.  I guess reincarnation explained how Talon and Sunshine could fall in love in one day, but why was that necessary?  Because they fell in love so quickly, the rest of their story consisted of them repeating the same angst-ridden thoughts over and over and over.<br />Finally, I'm getting tired of the \\"poor me\\" attitude of the lead male characters.  Will there ever be a happy Dark Hunter?  Or at least one who has a healthy mental attitude? Is that too much to ask?  The whole [I was severely mistreated in my past so I've remained angry for centuries] schtick is getting really old. I keep wanting to tell these Dark Hunters, \\"Get over yourselves!\\"	2004-04-28

The author introduces a supposedly &quot;kick ass&quot; (literally) heroine who's a member of her planet's security forces, who turns into a shrill, bitchy, pain-the-ass when she meets the first man who's ass she can't kick.  I was disgusted as Tedra was at turns  petulant child and hysterical ninny.  I expected to dislike Challen because of his &quot;barbaric&quot; ways, but he actually turned out to be the mature adult in that relationship.  I actually felt sorry for him.<br />On top of that, the sci-fi aspects of this story were pretty pathetic.  Tedra is from a plant in a completely different galaxy from ours, yet her speech is peculiarly American: she refers to &quot;humanoids,&quot; uses the terms &quot;babe&quot; and &quot;sweetcakes&quot; incessantly, among other things.  Science fiction obviously is not this author's strong suit.<br />In short, I struggled to finish this book.  Don't waste your money.	2004-03-29

At first, I was not disappointed.  This book had an excellent premise, and a very engrossing beginning.  But approximately 100 pages into it, and it completely stalled and moved forward at a snail's pace.  Essentially, nothing much happened during the next 100 pages.  This author is far too wordy.  She says in 5 pages what could be said in one.  At first I appreciated the amount of detail, especially when describing the WITSEC program that Ricki went through.  But after a while, I realized the author simply likes to go on and on about a subject, even when it's wiser to stop.  I also found her writing pretty flat.  I think it's very telling that the love scenes sparked not the slightest emotion in me.  They were completely mechanical, which I think is this author's writing style.  Instead of showing me how Max felt, the author told me.  That just doesn't work with love scenes.  Again, she provided detail where she should have provided evoked passion.  I put this book down (and picked it back up again) at least 10 times in two days.  I tried so hard to keep reading it, because I did want to know how the book ended, but it just couldn't keep my interest.  Not sure if I'll bother with any other of this author's books.  Perhaps there's not enough &quot;wow&quot; in her books for me.	2004-03-11

The plot was decent, but the writing was overblown and repetitive.  If Cade \\"ran his fingers through his hair\\" one more time, or agonized over how Marly would \\"run away screaming\\" if she was exposed to his sex practices, I thought I would scream myself.  Also, Cade's character in particular was so overdone. He repeatedly went from extreme anger to gentle sensitivity, without explanation. His hand wringing and angst about his sexual attraction to Marly was particularly annoying.  The author provided no explanation of why Cade would be ashamed of his attraction [...].  Cade also repeatedly characterized himself as this sexual bad boy whom Marly shouldn't want to tangle with.  [...] <br />The mystery element [...] couldn't save an otherwise uninteresting book.<br />To top it off, the book was full of typographical errors, grammatical errors (repeated and inexcusable use of incorrect verb tense) and typesetting errors.  I counted over one hundred of these.  Given the astronomical price of this paperback ($...), I would expect a much better product. [...], I would be embarassed to put my name on this poorly written, sloppily edited and printed book.  If you want solid romance, with well-written plots and characters, coupled with graphic, raunchy sex, read anything by Emma Holly (\\"Menage,\\" \\"Top of Her Game\\" and \\"Cooking Up a Storm\\" are particularly excellent), who is head and shoulders above this author.	2004-03-03

I thought the plot was pretty believable, with one exception:  Jade's son's basically nonchalant reaction to being informed that he was the product of a rape was completely unbelievable.  Such a revelation would have had incredibly damaging psychological consequences on a 14-year-old boy.  I thought the fact that Jade had kept this important fact from her son was very irresponsible and selfish, and the author basically chickened out and failed to hold Jade responsible for this.  Other than, an entertaining read.	2004-02-24

Not once did he have a nice, pleasant, kind thing to say to the heroine.  He treated her like dirt from beginning to end, until the last sentence in the book, when he unbelievably says, &quot;I love you.&quot;  Cash was a misogynist, cruel creep, and Schyler was a pathetic doormat.  Her love for him made no sense because, other than his economically and emotionally disadvantaged past, there was nothing about Cash to make him even slightly sympathetic, let alone worth loving.  I know this book was written 15 years ago, but I am appalled that even then, this author would have thought that a woman should love a man who treated her this abusively.  I can love an alpha male as well as the next woman, but even an alpha  male should have respect for the heroine, which Cash did not.  Their relationship was sick, and should not be used as an example of what a romantic relationship should be.	2004-02-23

The portrayal of Milla was one of the most realistic that I've ever seen.  Many authors would have overdone some aspect of her character:  she would have been too obsessed, too passive, to full of self pity.  Instead, Linda Howard's portrayal was truly deft, giving Milla an incredible depth.  As one of the characters said, we would all like to think that our moms would have kept looking for us as long as Milla looked for her son.  Milla's single-minded drive wasn't overdone, so she came off as sympathetic, not pathetic or obsessed.  She was strong and focused, but still vulnerable.  She also managed to maintain a very mature perspective on how the path she had chosen (devoting 10 years of her life to the search for her son) destroyed her marriage.  She had earned the right to be bitter about the fact that her husband divorced her, but instead she understood that it was she who had actually abandoned him, emotionally.  And the way she handled her son's adoptive parents showed what a truly amazing person she was.  My only disappointment was in the character Diaz.  I wish we had seen a bit more from his perspective.  He was a little too enigmatic for me.  Also, there was little explanation of how he got into his line of work, which was such a central part of his character and personality.  In addition, after he betrayed Milla in such a fundamental way, I thought she forgave him too quickly. Other than those criticisms, I thought this book was fabulous.	2004-02-10

Unlike other time travel/romance novels, this one took its time getting to the time travel/hero meets heroine part.  My only criticism is that, once that occurred, the book was wrapped up far too quickly.  The book should have been at least another 50 pages.

Lou's character was very well fleshed out, and there was lots of humor.  I loved the fact that Lou was mentally strong, and that when she and Jack were fleeing from the bad guys, it was Lou who kept saving the day.  But after Lou and Jack made it back to civilization, the plot just flopped.  The ending was very stupid, so much so that I skimmed through most of it.  Jack's reluctance to tell Lou he loved her, and to settle down and get married was not very credible.  The author didn't give a convincing reason of why he was such a womanizer, and why, at this point in his life when he'd realized that his life as an actor was pretty empty, he wasn't more willing to settle down.<br />I also absolutely hated the character of Vicky.  She was vain and shallow and had absolutely no redeeming qualities.  The fact that Lou kept her as a friend doesn't say very good things about Lou's character.  In fact, having a Vicky as a friend was so inconsistent with Lou's character that I think the author should have spent more time thinking that through.  I agree with others that the blowing up of the abandoned mine was totally lacking in credibility.  There's no way that any state, let along Alaska, would permit that to happen, especially when it would jeopardize the habitat of wildlife.  Again, a little more research and forethought by the author would have gone a long way to making this a much better read.	2004-01-07

The author just repeated the same things over and over: Blair insisting she couldn't love Graeme because of the Prophecy; Graeme forbidding Blair from practicing witchcraft; Graeme vascillating between being turned on by Blair ... and turned off by her powers.  That was basically the whole book in a nutshell.  None of the characters had any depth and, therefore, they were all boring and tedious.  To her credit, the author at least tried to tie in the historical aspects, but even this was handled in a very cursory fashion.  Essentially, it seemed that this book was written by an ordinary person who had read a lot of romance novels and thought, \\"This doesn't look so hard, I bet I can write a romance novel,too.\\"  Well, this deficient effort proves that writing a solid, interesting romance novel is harder than it looks, and takes much more talent than this author possesses.  I definitely will not bother reading any more of her books.	2003-11-24

This book was unoriginal and unimaginative.  Not only was the plot absolutely stupid (a scientist, who is betrothed to someone out of family obligation, hires a semi-successful American romance novelist to teach him how to charm women?  Huh?)  Since Dexter and his intended, Lady Sarah, were childhood buddies who loved each other like friends, why the need to charm her?  As if that weren't bad enough, the characters were all such stereotyped caricatures:  the romance author who is secretly a virgin, the tough-talking New Yorker Jewish princess, the uptight, nerdy British lord (living in a castle, naturally) who is stereotypically stiff (there was actually a scene where Mallory teaches Dexter how to shake his hips, for heaven's sake!).  The writing was also bad.  Mallory actually refers to Dexter's job offer as an offer she &quot;could not refuse.&quot;  And, just in case the readers were on Mars when the movie came out, the author felt the need to inform us that this was a line from &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  Yikes.  But, because I hate to start a book and not finish it, I plodded through it, only to run into the absolutely unnecessary, soap-opera-like plot twist that Mallory's dad left them because she found out he was molesting her younger sister Genie, and threatened to kill the dad if he ever touched Genie again.  This revelation is followed by a tear-fest that was painful to read.  Yuck.  And, just to make sure she exhausted every romance novel/movie cliche, the book concludes with Dexter's supposed-to-be-dramatic race to catch Mallory before she boards a plane back to America.  Wow.  If this is all it takes to m ake millions writing books, I'm changing jobs tomorrow.	2003-11-13

However, I thought Angela Knight's story was by far the stronger of the two.  The first story, by Diane Whiteside, was weak on the sci fi aspects of this tale, which made it confusing.   It made no attempt to explain why the world and characters they wrote about in their novels were real. I also kept wondering why Corrine never defended herself against Mykh, by pointing out that she can hardly be blamed for harming him when she had no idea she was doing so.   Also, Corrine accepts, without wondering or explaining why, that even though she supposedly created Mykh's world, there's so much she doesn't know about it.  Also, the way the author described Mykh's world was boring. Nothing happened except ceremony after ceremony, pomp and circumstance after pomp and circumstance.<br />Angela Knight's story made up for these shortcoming.  She is clearly the stronger thinker and writer.  Right from the beginning, Celeste behaved as I would expect a woman in her position to behave.  Unlike Corrine, she defended herself against Jarred, getting him to admit that holding her responsible didn't make sense since she didn't know the world she was writing about was real.  Also, this story spent the necessary time exploring how Celeste and Corrine wound up writing about and manipulating worlds that actually existed (essentially, mental telepathy).  <br />Overall, though, this is a great read.	2003-11-12

The best thing was that both characters were strong and intelligent.  The dialogue was excellent -- Lucien's and Alex's verbal battles were so sharp and hilarious.  Also, I loved the fact that both characters showed such emotional depth.  By far, Lucien is one of the best romance hero ever written in an historical romance.  <br />My only criticism is the lovemaking scenes -- they were so tame they almost put me to sleep!!  I realize that not every romance author is comfortable writing graphic sex scenes, but lovemaking scenes are included in romance stories for a reason.  If written well, these scenes can explore and explain the characters' growing attraction, as well as give the reader glimpses into their hearts.  That didn't happen here at all.  One of the lovemaking scenes was a mere three sentences long!!  Talk about \\"wham-bam-thank-you-mam\\"!!!  The way it was described, I don't see how the lovemaking was at all satisfying to Alexandra.  And that's part of what romance is all about.  Thre has to be some sizzle between the characters in order to make their physical attraction credible.  This book clearly lacked that.  Aside from this rather glaring shortcoming, this book had the romance, fun, wit and depth to make it a very enjoyable read.	2003-10-29

I should have know I was in trouble when I started skimming portions after the first ten or so pages.  The plot essentially consisted of two neverending scenes: the Cyprian Ball scene, which took up one-quarter of the book, and the scene on the ship, escaping the French, which took up half of the book. On the other hand, the author simply omitted the parts of the plot that would actually have been interesting: the events of Georgie's youth, the events that led up to Colin's &quot;fake&quot; court-martial, and the events that occurred in the year Colin and Georgie were apart (like Georgie having a baby, for heaven's sake!).   So instead, these two wooden characters fall in love in three hours, don't see each other for a year, then reunite and their love is as strong as ever.  Total hogwash.  Plus Georgie's role in outwitting the French captain was wholly implausible.  There's more, but I don't have the mental energy to cover it all.  Simply put, this author simply cannot write, and I will not waste my time on any more of her books.	2003-10-14

I loved Behind Closed Doors, because it was so original.  Steamy sex, alpha-male/malleable female who were three-dimensional, great suspense -- that book offered something most romantic suspense is missing.  Standing in the Shadows had that too, but that's the problem.  This book was almost a complete replica of BCD.  Especially the sex scenes, where the insecure alpha male repeatedly uses aggressive sex to control the heroine.  Throughout the book, I kept thinking, &quot;been there, done that.&quot;  Also, although I loved the graphic, steamy sex scenes, I agree with other readers that the amount of sex didn't make sense in the context of the book. I mean, Connor knows that an insane, evil, maniacal man is out to kill Erin, and could come around the corner any minute, and yet Connor and Erin engage in 72 hours straight of sex, in her house, which is the first place the killer would come looking for her?  It made the book seem silly.  Don't get me wrong, even with it's faults, this book is head above other stuff in this genre.  And I look forward to reading stories featuring Connor's brothers, Davy and Sean.  I just hope that the author will take a new approach with those books, perhaps making the men a little more sensitive, and the women a little more assertive.	2003-10-01

When I saw the cover of this book (which didn't do the contents justice), I expected a frivolous, silly book.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a well-written romance about complex characters, with sub-characters who were just as interesting and integral to the plot as the main characters.  In some ways, I liked Tom and Susanna's story better than Jane and Annie's.  It was so nice to see that, even after 30-plus years of marriage, a husband can find his wife sexy, and can find the strength to resist the temptation to stray.  When Jake and Annie's first meeting ended so badly, I was so afraid the would engage in a vicious custody fight that would make any later reconciliation implausible.  What was so nice is that Jake and Annie's friends helped them stay level-headed about their predicament, and concentrate on what was best for Madeline.  Very well done, and I highly recommend this book.	2003-09-16

While reading the first two-thirds of this book, I agreed with those reviewers who found Jane annoyingly gun-shy about falling in love with Mike.  But by the end of the book I realized that the problem was that Jane, Mike and her ex Edward were all so one-dimensional.  If Jane was super wary, Mike just the opposite, convinced that he was in love with her and wanted to marry her after talking to her for five minutes.  I found both of these extremes annoying and unbelievable. Also, Edward the ex was made to be so mean as to actually be borderline evil.  I mean, what kind of human being is so self-absorbed that he isn't aware his son, who has a history of asthma, is suffering a life-threatening asthma attack?  And if he was that evil, what the hell was wrong with Jane that she not only picked him in the first place, but had a child with him and stayed with him for five years?

By the middle of the book, I actually felt sorry for Logan, for the fact that he would be stuck with this neurotic crackpot for the rest of his life.  Have you ever met a couple where the guy is drop dead gorgeous, super nice and the gal is an absolute witch?  And you ask yourself: &quot;This guy could have anyone, so why in hell is he with her?&quot;  Well, Logan and Scarlett are going to inspire that reaction in everyone they meet.  Obviously Scarlett's nosy paranoia was supposed to be endearing or sympathetic, but I just had no respect for someone who could jump to such ridiculous, hurtful conclusions about people based on so few facts.  I didn't blame Logan for being frustrated with her and, like the other reviewer, when he walked out on Scarlett I was actually cheering, and therefore was disappointed when he forgave her less than a page later.  To make matters worse, Scarlett doesn't redeem herself by tackling and conquering her trust issues on her own like a mature, introspective adult.  Instead, Logan has to solve her problems for her, by painstakingly forcing her to actually think (gasp!!) logically for once.  I couldn't believe that he had to tell a 29-year-old to actually investigate her assumptions instead of jumping to conclusions.  Realistically, Scarlett should have been a complete turn-off for Logan, and the author never convinced me why this wasn't so.  Patti Berg certainly isn't the best romance author out there, but this story doesn't meet even her previous standards.	2003-08-21

I haven't finished the book yet, but I just had to chime in and confirm that this book has the most unappealing, unsympathetic hero of any romance I've read in a long while.  I mean, he had a one-night-stand with his first wife, and marries her when he gets her pregnant.  After their son dies he proceeds to cheat on her numerous times, leading her to commit suicide.  Then, while drunk, he marries a stripper whom he divorces a day later.  Then he has a one-night-stand with the heroine, and dumps her at the airport the next day.  This is all in the first 50 pages!!  I thought we would actually see some introspection on his part, and perhaps understand why he was such a [jerk] in the past.  But, that didn't happen.  The heroine was little better.  A very sad and confused woman with absolutely no self-esteem or self-respect.  And, frighteningly, she's raising a 6-year-old who you suspect won't turn out much better.  Also, I know I tend to be a stickler for grammar, but it drove me absolutely crazy that the 6-year-old repeatedly said \\"gots\\" instead of \\"has\\" or \\"have,\\" yet none of the adults in her life ever corrected her.  Apparently her first-grade teacher never corrected her either.  Drove me crazy.  Anyway, this is an okay book to read on the beach, but there are many better that would do much better.  I certainly wouldn't spend any money on this one.	2003-08-19

But the author made up for that with refreshingly novel (no pun intended) story elements (Ferdinand was a virgin, and Viola really was a prostitute)and by showing in a credible way how these characters' love for each other grew.  And Ferdinand was such a warm, giving hero (which is unusual in period romances) and my heart just melted when Ferdinand declared himself Viola's &quot;champion,&quot; and avenged her against Kirby.  So, though I prefer my romances fast and spicy, I really liked this slow and mellow one a lot.  I think I'll try this authors other works!!	2003-08-14

After reading this book I've concluded that I just can't stomach the alpha male heroes in this author's early books.  The totally unsubtle, slam-bam-thank-you-mam approach is just too over-the-top for me.  I have also been consistently disappointed by this author's love scenes, and her inability to credibly portray sexual chemistry between her lead characters.  I liked how the heroine constantly kept the hero on his toes, but he was just plain tiresome.  I'll stick to this author's more recent works.	2003-08-13

The lead characters were funny, complex and engaging.  Most of the plot was interesting.  Unlike some reviewers, I was not turned off by Phoebe's over-the-top bimbo act. I thought it was consistent with her past experiences, and it was a refreshing change from the heroine who's unattractive or doesn't know how to use her sexuality.  My main beef with this book was the hokey, unbelievable climax, where Dan essentially proves his love for Phoebe by being willing to throw the AFC Championship game.  Not at all credible, and actually a little disgusting, when you think about it.  If you love or are knowledgeable about the NFL, you will hate this book.  Otherwise, I recommend it.	2003-08-12

Finally, I've found another author besides Susan Andersen who writes funny, engaging, fulfilling contemporary romances with compelling lead characters.  So often it's the romance heroine who is more richly drawn, but Dylan was one of the best romance heros ever written.  Sexy as all get out, but sensitive and complex.  The scene where he tells his son Adam that it's okay to cry when he leaves with his mom actually made me cry.  And I also loved the fact that so much of the story (including an excellent love scene) is told from Dylan's perspective.  To me, that's what makes an excellent love story--seing things from the guy's point of view.  Hope was quirky without being irritating, as was the town of Gospel.  I can't wait to read this author's other works.  I just hope they're as good!!	2003-08-07

US	39512420	RDMW1W9UEOFY2	0373835396	928905497	Four In Hand	Books	2	4	7	N	N	Very unsatisfying.	I beg of the author: Please do not EVER AGAIN write a book with EIGHT leading characters, and four &quot;romances.&quot;  Any author with even a lick of sense would have known she could not do justice to any of the subplots.  Don't get me wrong: I think it was a nifty idea to use the plot device of a Duke assigned the task of marrying off four precocious wards. And I really liked the fact that, unlike most historical romance heroines, the four sisters were very sophisticated and had impressive feminine wiles. But I think it would have been much more interesting to only cover Max and Caroline's story in this book, then give each of the other girls their own book.  Instead, we get this mishmash.  According to the cover, the story was about Max and Caroline, yet they were rarely featured together in the book.  None of the couples ever spent time getting to know each other; they were just instantly attracted to one another, and apparently that was enough for them to know they wanted to be together forever. I actually found Sarah's and Darcy's story the most compelling, probably because it was covered in the most detail.  On top of that, the author threw in the silly subplot of the girls trying to get Amanda and Ralph together, for no apparent reason.  I wound up skimming the last half of the book.  Don't waste your money or time on this one.  This is my second Stephanie Laurens book, and I also found the last one unsatisfying.  Not sure I'm going to bother reading this author again.	2003-08-05

I just can't understand why so many readers rated it so highly.  I can only surmise that they haven't read really good erotica, or erotic romance.  The only promising thing about this story was its premise.  Everything else about the story made no sense.  The Trek Mi'Qan are supposedly light years ahead of us socially, yet the women are kept as sexual pets?  The women wear see-through \\"Jeanie\\" clothes, and the men, who are all \\"warriors,\\" are dressed from head to toe?  Sounds more like an Earth man's fantasy than an advanced civilization.  They're supposedly advanced sexually, yet the sex was pretty tame.  Apparently in this universe you have sex four ways only: missionary, \\"doggy-style,\\" woman on top, and oral sex.  Nothing advanced there.  No bondage, S&M, anal sex, or same-gender sex.  From reading the reviews, I expected a book that was sexually daring.  Instead, I found the same \\"slam-bam\\" fest you'd find in a porno flick.  The same sexual episodes, described exactly the same, over and over. Boring!!  Not to mention the lame plot, the finger-snapping, neck-bobbing, \\"you-go-girl,\\" ghetto Mama stereotyped black female character.  This author has so little talent. I have a dare for anyone who was impressed with this book.  If you want to read erotic romance that has sizzling, daring sex that will make you panties (or pants) wet, with believeable plots and characters you'll care about, check out anything written by Emma Holly.  Start with her Black Lace book entitled \\"Menage\\" and you'll be hooked.  After reading her, you'll wonder why you were ever impressed with Ms. Black.	2003-04-15

Although I enjoyed this book, I repeatedly thought while reading it that, if it had been about 100 pages longer, it could have been so much better.  The premise of the book was original and fun.  There was lots of humor throughout, which I liked.  But the writing was almost too light, without the depth necessary to make a novel a real keeper.  Normally plots move along too slowly and drag.  This book moved along too quickly and essentially skimmed the surface.  Even the love scenes were too short and matter-of-fact, not drawn out enough to make them really sizzle.  But I liked this book enough to read the next one, and I just hope it has a little more depth.	2003-04-02
US	39512420	R399BT6HJ6HXWM	0743446135	289755142	Scent of Danger	Books	2	3	3	N	N	Boring and flat.	This book was so boring I couldn't get through it. The plot moved far too slowly, and we were given lots of detailed prose about aspects of the story that weren't very interesting.  Normally romantic thrillers are lacking in either the romance department or the thriller department.  This book was lacking in both.  The main characters were two-dimensional.  Instead of letting us get inside the characters and learn who they really were, we were just given the cut-and-dried facts about their pasts.  The author apparently expected us to assume things about the characters from their backgrounds.  As a result, I didn't care about either of the main characters, or about what was going to happen to them.  Sabrina and Dylan had absolutely no chemistry!!  If you hadn't known this was a romance, you wouldn't have known that they were supposed to be attracted to each other.  So even though their first kiss came very late in the book, it still seemed premature, because up to that point neither character had had a single romantic thought about the other.  As far as the \\"thriller,\\" it was boring.  I couldn't have cared less who shot Carson Brooks.  Again, without any insight into his character, I had no feelings about him one way or the other.  Also, the author used this irritating technique of giving information about the characters through lengthy stretches of dialogue.  The dialogue ended up seeming contrived and unrealistic as a result.  Sorry that I spent ${munnies}on this poorly written book.	2003-03-24

This isn't the first Jennifer Blake novel I've read, and my recollection is that her other books were much better than this one.  I know it's the last in a long series of novels about the Benedicts and their cousins; perhaps she ran out of steam.  This book's concept was promising, and I found the first half of the book very interesting.  I was fascinated by Chloe's transformation from precoscious American teen into an outwardly submissive yet internally rebellious Muslim woman. I felt I really understood how women in those countries must feel.  Chloe's and Wade's escape from Hazaristan was thrilling.  But when they arrived in America, the story started to drag, drag, drag.  And the dialogue became stilted and inane.  I know that Ms. Blake hails from Louisiana, but I thought all the \\"aw, shucks,\\" good ole boy dialogue among the Benedict clan was just too much.  I also thought Ahmad's character became so overblown as to be a caricature.  Because he was the author's sole plot device, his conduct became more and more bizarre and incredible, in order to keep the plot going.  I mean, come on, he slits his own sister's throat because she tried to help Chloe escape?  Then, in spite of the fact that he is apparently very occupied helping al Qaida with their terrorist efforts (and really, was the al Qaida tie-in really necessary?), he takes time out to follow Chloe to America so he can kill not only her, but the entire Benedict clan?  Because of all this distraction, the first love scene between Wade and Chloe was anticlimactic and flat.  I don't know about any other love scenes, because I put the book down after that and never picked it up again.  In my humble opinion, don't bother with this one.  Jennifer Blake can write and has written much better books.	2003-02-25
US	39512420	RTWB96HQ9EW9O	0553563335	844209901	Fairest of Them All	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Medeiros never disappoints!!	This is the fourth or fifth book I've read by this author, and I'm so impressed by how she always delivers.  Unlike many romance authors, she doesn't follow any particular pattern, either in subject matter or storyline.  The theme of this book was unique and refreshing: a woman who's tired of being loved for her looks but, when she becomes ugly, learns that because she wasn't that beautiful \\"on the inside\\" to begin with, maybe her looks were the only thing about her worth loving after all, and decides to change her ways.  This book contains the humor we've come to expect from Medeiros.  But the book isn't so light that it lacks substance.  Case in point, my favorite, heartmelting scene: Austyn, believing that Holly is about to be raped, urges her not to fight and risk her life, assuring her that he'll love her no matter what happens.  This book delivered everything you could want in a romance.  It's a keeper.	2003-02-20
