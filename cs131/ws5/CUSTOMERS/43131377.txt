It is targeted at woodturners and appears to achieve this, unpretentiously. It is obvious to compare this with the recent book by Terry Porter and in this case a very close comparison is possible indeed as in many cases it uses the exact same photographs (same publisher, same photographer). Occasionally this is quite amusing as where one and the same \\"platter in ripple maple\\" turned by Mark Baker is depicted as European maple in Porter's book but as rock maple in this book. This book is much brighter in all aspects of printing (same publishing staff, different font, different printer) but most notable in the pictures of the wood samples, which look more realistic here. <br />Still, this is short of an ideal book. Preparation and selection of wood surfaces is occasionally well short of what it might be. A number of popular errors (the misidentification of Brazilian tulipwood, the description of masur birch, etc) is perpetuated here. The pictures of the \\"100 woods in brief\\" are reduced in scale and not as good as those of the \\"50 woods in detail\\". All in all, quite a likable book, that will look good in any wood library.	2005-09-11

This is a book on industrial design written for designers: beautifully printed and bound, in glorious color. Its strengths are also its weaknesses. The 'functional white space' is on the verge of being overwhelming, especially in the part that is supposed to give technical information. The definition of \\"wood\\" is a designer's and includes bamboo, coconut fibres, ply and various wood derivatives. For actual information on wood the reader had better turn elswehere. As a book to show possibilities and to inspire previously unthought-of uses of wood, this will do fine.	2005-04-22

A well-printed book with really lovely pictures, it presents some of the most famous trees belonging to the genus /Adansonia/, focusing on trees as \\"trunks with branches\\". The text is well-written, and makes for a light read. Noticeable weak points are that the author's wife is in quite a few photographs although she does not take a particular good picture and that the author adopts /Adansonia_gibbosa/ as the name of the Australian baobab, instead of the better known (and now protected) /Adansonia_gregorii/ (without even explaining why he does this).	2005-01-20

It is just too overwhelming. As can be expected these days of the Timber Press this is a lavishly illustrated, gorgeously printed and handsomely bound volume. Lay-out is immaculate. All pictures (full color) are of a beautiful quality, or better. An immense amount of information is given for each species (usually one page is devoted to each species). In view of the wealth of information provided, there is a huge potential for error, but the book appears to be remarkably error-free. A curious error is that of using \\"cv.\\" before a cultivar epithet. The one error-prone category here is that of the author abbreviations in the botanical names: these do not consistently follow the recommended standard and, from time to time, are in something of a mess. Obviously, this is unlikely to trouble those who belong to the book's target audience. The other thing that can be questioned is its aim to cram so many trees into one book. However, for someone wanting a handy (if big) one-volume work on (sub)tropical trees this cannot be recommended enough. It will also make a lovely gift to just about anybody.	2004-12-16

This new book is splendidly printed and should do a great job of infecting the reader with enthousiasm for wood. The pictures are almost exclusively full color photographs of a uniformly good quality. As long as the reader keeps in mind that this is a coffee-table book only and that the author does not exert himself in trying to get his details right, but limits himself to presenting a good story (just staying in the ballpark), this will be most enjoyable.	2004-08-04

As the dollar drops against the euro, books from Europe are getting ever more expensive, and Linden Publishing must have felt it was time to offer a cheap alternative to the wellknown \\"Tropical Timber Atlas, Volume I - Africa\\" (1987), the book by the joint timber trade on 83 African commercial timbers. As far as price and printing quality are concerned this was a success, a sturdy hardback at a much handier size, lovely glossy paper, offering distribution maps and color pictures at a nice size. This is a slick looking book! This book treats 90 African woods, with two (facing) pages per species, arranged by trade name. Unfortunately by content it is quite a step down from the earlier book. The names are quite a mess. Anybody looking for African blackwood either has to know that the author is German and that the German trade name is Grenadill or has to use the index. Botanical names are treated quite callously, with perhaps its worst in \\"Gnophyllum giganteum of the family Meliaceae\\": it took me something like a day to figure out that this was supposed to be \\"Ganophyllum giganteum of the family Sapindaceae\\". Obsolete names abound, as do typos. I did not look too closely at the text after finding some items that turned my stomach.     Much of the value of a book like this is in the pictures, and there are a few nice ones, but they appear the exception. Too many are useless when it comes to giving an impression of what the wood looks like; a few are plain wrong. Overall this is an attractive looking book, but users should be aware that no reliance whatsoever is to be placed on anything in this work without a careful check against a real book.	2004-03-18

With this book they appear to have lifted the publishing of fine books to a new level. They not only found a group of people dedicated to their subject and to fine photography who captured the saillant features in almost invariably excellent pictures, but also managed to find a layout to do these pictures full justice. Basically (almost) every maple species (or subspecies) has two pages devoted to it (or a multiple of that): a page of text and a page of pictures. Where more pages are devoted to a single maple sometimes a full page is devoted to a single picture, but this is the exception. Usually there are several pictures per page with large pictures of habit and smaller pictures of detail. The effect is quite splendid. A quick browse through the text reveals nothing out of place, with a recent classification being followed, although I suspect that a really close look will show up nitpickingly small errors. All in all this is really magnificent maple book, with a considerable wow!-factor.	2004-03-04

It is excellently printed on glossy paper. Picture quality generally is excellent. The text is neatly organized, with botanical names properly written (even synonyms provided where necessary, in footnotes). <br />Still, it feels like something is missing. Maybe it is that I would expect a book(let) that focuses on 44 species to offer extensive pictorial coverage. Ususally a book will have many species with few pictures each or few species with many pictures each (or at least full-sized ones). Maybe it is the fact that although the title promises &quot;shrubs&quot; the plants covered are all over the place (including two Cacti, one Yucca, many trees and even a &quot;perennial shrub&quot; on p84). <br />There does appear to be nothing really wrong here (disregarding the allegation that Ephedra has &quot;fruit&quot;) and it is a really nice book(let), but still somewhat unsatisfying.	2003-12-03

Picture quality varies from pretty decent to quite good, although it is noticeable that a curious grid tends to be visible in the background (a digital camera?). Some pictures are a little overexposed. Occasionally the composition could be better (sometimes a lot better). Text seems unremarkable, but the choice to include author citations in the botanical names has not been followed up by doing this properly (needs a lot of work). Synonyms are provided. The \\"Trees\\" in the title should be taken to include a palm; the \\"Shrubs\\" is meant in the widest possible sense (including subshrubs and smaller stuff) and this goes for \\"Cacti\\" too (= \\"succulents\\").

Its subtitle \\"Wood and Woodworking in the Bible\\" is a lot more accurate but still a bit off. This is a book about the Bible and the plants in it, with an emphasis on wood. It consists of a contemplative text on the Bible (p7-83), a pretty extensive  treatment of plant names in the Bible (p99-241), a brief treatment on non-Biblical trees and shrubs in Palestine (p243-255), an even briefer treatment of the appropriate woodworking tools (p257-266) and a mysterious conclusion (p267-275).<br />In a way this is quite intriguing. This is a print-on-demand book at a Christian publisher, which means that anybody who fancies himself a writer and who compiles a book on something Christian can have a book in print, without an editor getting involved. A book on the plants in the Bible by somebody who feels passionately on the topic but whose expertise is in none of the several fields involved seems like a disaster waiting to happen. Against this background this is quite a good book, free of disaster. Since I well know where the errors are likely to be in a book of this kind I looked for them, and indeed they are there. But not nearly as many of them as there might be. The author certainly did a fair bit of homework and avoided most of the likely pitfalls. In its way this is a quite a commendable book.<br />Nevertheless this is a book with a narrow focus, without any illustrations, with its due share of errors and with a printing quality that is only average. Likely it will be nowhere near a match for Nigel Hepper's \\"Planting a Bible Garden\\" when it comes to popular appeal.	2003-10-22

This is a very attractively printed book in full color that will look good on any bookshelf. On the whole it seems to be value for money. Unsurprisingly (seems to be traditional for books aimed at the woodworker) the chapter on wood anatomy is botched a little, but not enough to bother the woodworker. Untypically it also has the composition of hardboard wrong.<br />This might be described as a supercharged version of the &quot;Good Wood Handbook&quot; by Jackson &amp; Day, aiming towards the level of &quot;Understanding wood&quot; by Hoadley. I guess that for the novice I still would recommend the &quot;Good Wood Handbook&quot; on account of its somewhat lower price but especially because the pictures of the woods treated are bigger and better (more wood for your money). Also it has more woods (72 versus 64) and they are arranged by botanical name rather than trade name. For more detail I would still recommend Hoadley. <br />Still this has a personal element and I would understand anybody who prefers this to the &quot;Good Wood Handbook&quot;. It would not be silly to have both on the shelf (the woods treated do not overlap completely).	2003-08-02

I read my way through the Apple chapter, which was readable, but quite light on facts (heavy on wordy prose).     I tried to read the Tulip chapter but soon felt quite uneasy. On page 69 I hit:  \\"To induce flies into its inner sanctum (there to be digested by waiting enzymes), the pitcher plant has developed a weirdly striated maroon-and-white flower ...\\". It is hard to imagine that this is the result of mere ignorance, and not to suspect actual intent to misinform people on plants (and botany)?    Maybe some time I will try to read the chapter on Marihuana, which should be mostly about the history of its use and thus safe in the hands of (even) Michael Pollan?	2003-08-01

I bought this for the pictures of Welwitschia cones, something I did not encounter a good picture of before. Admittedly these are an exception in the degree of detail they show: all the other pictures are 'atmosphere' pictures only. This is really a coffee-table book only, not a tree book.<br />For a coffee table book it has relatively few errors. Sure, on page 63 the lay-out editor inserted the &quot;(right)&quot; at the wrong place in the caption (should have been after &quot;nuts&quot; instead of &quot;pods&quot;) and an occasional misspelling of &quot;ginkgo&quot; slipped through. Worse the taxonomic position of Welwitschia is misdescribed (off the scale). The chapter on yew is indeed riddled with errors. A knowledgable editor with a red pencil could have a whale of a time. But for a coffee-table book it is well above average and it has got its facts mostly straight (and up to date). It is a coffee-table book, not science.<br />The most remarkable thing wrong with it is that it omitted the best documented oldest genuine tree species, even though it is extremely big. This must be because it occurs about as far away from England as can be. The book has a distinct bias: the world's oldest tree species occur in England with the British Empire's former Colonies bringing up the rear. The rest of the world is devoid of old trees! (Allright, one species that is often planted on English lawns is thrown in to represent the rest of the world). A coffee-table book for sure, meant for the English coffee-table.	2003-07-26

The author trekked around the world to personally look at all the species of pines (true pines, members of the genus Pinus) in their natural habitat and this is the result. The book consists, per species, of a page with line-drawings of the habit (by the author) and an opposing page with supporting text. These are big pages, by the way. At the time of writing it was a complete overview of the genus, but since this time the author wrote two additional books on neotropical pines. These are more up-to-date in all respects. In the part in the Flora Neotropica there is even a bit on the wood of Pinus. In this, the author's first book, it is noteable that the nomenclatural details are a bit iffy. <br />On a practical note this is very expensive for a book without a single color picture (just the line drawings, which are pretty good but not stunningly so). It is a somewhat clumsy size (it does look good next to the volume on Pinaceae by the same author). All in all, this is a book that will be at home with a specialist on trees or conifers, but hardly anywhere else.	2003-06-10

It also includes more descriptions of families.    In some ways the book has not changed. The same illustrations were used giving it the same look. It remain an introductory book, that although set up along the lines of a systembook is only of limited use as such, since coverage is far from complete. The Appendix on \\"Botanical nomenclature\\" is still a soft spot. Not only is the (badly) erroneous bit on the naming of cultivated plants still there, but the slanted view of the ICBN has worsened (the ICBN even being called \\"Linnaean\\"!) and the PhyloCode is plugged.    However this remains the foremost textbook for those wanting a start in plant taxonomy, a field that is changing ever more rapidly.    The third edition (2007) is expanded yet again (to 612p). The most noticeable changes are the introduction of color, and a different, thinner kind of paper for the pages. Although it has more pages, the third edition is slimmer than the second. The printing quality of the (newly introduced) color photographs is quite decent, probably better than in the book by Simpson, although that has more photographs. In addition color is used to support the text and the occasional diagram, making this a brighter-looking book than the second edition.    The system followed is based on APG II (2003), while the second edition was close to APG I (1998) and included such families as Cecropiaceae and Celtidaceae, which now are out. A change from APG II is in the clade names such as fabids (instead of eurosids I) and campanulids (instead of euasterids I) which certainly is more user friendly.    Nevertheless, there is a strong continuity with the second edition, using the same line drawings as the main illustrations and with much of the text essentially the same.	2003-06-09

This book pretty much has it all: clear distribution maps, fine line-drawings of details and pretty decent color pictures of various other details (including bark).<br />Of course Canada has the 'advantage' of not having many tree species, which makes it easy for an author to be complete.

The format chosen is a series of brief entries on genera that contain some ornamental species. Each entry starts with a sketch of what the genus is used for, followed by a sketch of some species and what they are used for. A typical entry is a quarter of a page or so. Alternatively such an entry might be described as a few lines on a favorite species, preceded by a few lines on the genus and a few lines on a companion species. Information given is on gardening only and apparently very limited in accuracy (the author proclaims that Coffea has only a single important species!). <br />One in every two entries is accompanied by a color picture of a fifth to half a page.

It is very accessible with a good size of pictures, and some of these pictures are very good. The idea is that if one sees a brightly flowering roadside woody plant one whips out this guide, looks under the appropriate flower color and will find the popular ornamental it belongs to. This goes with a brief description of habit and a list of names (for several countries in Asia). In the back of the book one can find a brief entry with some further detail such as where the plant came from. The botanical names appear to be remarkably free from typos (although not quite).<br />The bad points are that among the pictures more than a few are a little overexposed (too much sun!). The selection of species illustrates quite clearly that tropical ornamentals (in Asia and elswhere) have become a universal and standard mix that ubiquitously accompanies Man wherever he goes.<br />For those who are in need of a guide (as described above) this will be a great, perhaps even invaluable resource. Good value for money! For those expecting to learn something of the tropical plants of Asia this will be a letdown, and not really worth taking up shelf space.	2003-06-06

That is just about all that can be said for or about this book. <br />The text is so-so: The worst offense appears (p43) \\"bansai trees\\" where they mean \\"bonzai trees\\", but the rest of the text is not nearly that bad. For a book on trees there are remarkably few trees in it. Something like half the book is palms.<br />The oversized pages make this a somewhat clumsy book. But the pictures are really, really great!	2003-04-22
US	43131377	R1NONJ246YEDL1	0806983876	803009189	Tropical Plants of the World	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Pretty neat?	This is a book with a familiar set-up: a page with two color pictures showing the flower(s) of a tropical plant, with on the opposite page a concise supporting text. It is a pity the book is not a little bigger, which would have allowed the pictures to be printed at a higher magnification. But I guess the size comes with the territory (and the price). The pictures are all of a decent quality (or better).<br />The author is a wellknown and top rank German botanist and the quality does shine through. However the original book was written in German, and the translation was quite lackadaisical. The Introduction contains some errors not even a novice botanist would have made: there is a caption where Tillandsia is called an Orchid and a caption that calls a flush of young Brownea leafs \\"leaf shedding\\". The bit on Plant names in the Introduction is even worse off. <br />Note that no synonyms are provided, which means that it may be hard to use this book alongside other works, of an earlier date. Those looking for Chorisia speciosa or Tabebuia pentaphylla will have to know to look for Ceiba speciosa and Tabebuia rosea or they won't find them.	2003-03-29

Of course it is always a relief to find a work without the ubiquitous hardiness maps and gardening advice. This handsomely printed volume in full color is a pleasure to browse through. Finally an arrangement of trees and shrubs that makes some sense, instead of the haphazard (read alphabetical) arrangement encountered so often. Although the authors wisely avoid the trap of involving themselves in the morass of common names they definitely miss a trick by not giving the etymology of the botanical names. It is quite odd to see a laurel-like picture of Daphniphyllum and not be able to read that &quot;daphne&quot; is the Greek word for &quot;laurel&quot; with &quot;phyllus&quot; the Greek for &quot;leaf&quot; <br />Of course trees and shrubs is too big a topic to fit within the covers of a single volume and it is not surprising to notice that the authors occasionally drop the ball and make quite silly errors. Obviously it would be too much to expect anybody to be fully informed on the whole range of plants covered.<br />Perhaps the most noticeable thing missing from this work is light. Quite a lot of the trees and shrubs included here have dark green foliage and in the pictures not much detail can be made out. A bit more light in photography would have made quite a difference.<br />All in all this is a book that will look good on the bookshelf and will be appreciated by anybody who is fond of trees and shrubs and is not afraid to look beyond the confines of the own garden.	2003-02-06
US	43131377	R3BL67NEHQKGB2	0917304756	590285949	1: Plants That Merit Attention: Trees	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Ok, but would merit further attention	The first thing to strike the eye when taking this book to hand is the full color and the beautiful glossy paper (no expense spared at the printer's!). The second thing to be noticed is the lay-out which is only just short of crummy (looks as if this was farmed out to India or the like). It looks pretty silly to have beautiful color pictures printed on expensive glossy paper and then having to look hard to make out the details. Without extra expense or effort the pictures could have been printed 25 to 50% bigger and this would have made the book twice as valuable. The quality of these pictures varies. There are some really great pictures here while others are ... mediocre.<br />The text was written by a committee and it looks it. This makes for easy comparison and reference, but for an uninspiring read. This fact distinctly decreases its value as a coffee-table book or as an object for delicious browsing. I am hoping the contents of the text are allright (I only browsed through it, but did spot some errors)<br />The botanical names appear mostly in order (I noticed only a few slips), which is not always so in horticultural books. Still these look a little silly because of the lay-out. Pity. Also the age of the book means that recent name changes have not been incorporated (I assume the reader will compensate for this).<br />I guess this is an OK book, that will look decent on the bookshelf, but that falls well short of what it could be.	2003-01-14

The sturdy size and thick paper which make it stand up to horticulturally engaged hands make for a clumsy book at home or in the library. Not much thought was given to lay-out and typography, with the wrong font chosen for this lay-out. The style of writing is rather dry and a little wordy. The nurseryman's indifference to spelling shines through often enough to make me ache for a corrector's pencil. <br />The cover claims \\"Identification\\" as a primary function of the book, but all the 'Manual' has to offer here is looking up a supposed identity and making a comparison. Pictorial support is quite limited (usually one line-drawing per species, mostly of a single leaf).<br />What this book does offer is the chance to quickly look up an unfamiliar cultivar, and this is why reviewers call it a \\"Bible\\". Any use beyond that will be a bonus.	2002-12-29

As reprints go this is quite good, with a sturdy cover. The book consists of a general part (Introduction, History, Currents &amp; Beaches, Collecting &amp; Uses, Key) and a catalog. The latter, which comprises just over half the book, consists for each entry of a page (or less) of text and a page (sometimes three) of line-drawings. The line-drawings are not of top quality but adequate.<br />Although it is good to have this back in print it would have been far preferable to see a revised, expanded and updated edition. In this day and age the black &amp; white photographs in the general part look distinctly out of place, especially for such an appealing subject matter, lending itself so well to spectacular color photography.

The contents appear serviceable but not outstanding. As apparently inevitable in book of this kind the chapter on &quot;structure of wood&quot; has many small (sometimes not so small) inaccuracies, but these refrain from overwhelming the usability of the chapter. The Gallery of Popular Wood also seems serviceableful, but also has its share of errors (especially the 'lacewood' item was pretty terrible, reflecting the confusion of the US woodworker in this respect).<br />For my money the 'Good_Wood_Handbook' by Jackson &amp; Day is the better choice for somebody wanting an allround introductory book on wood, mainly because it has more and better color pictures. However I can see how the indivual woodworker might prefer this because of the friendly style of writing. Maybe it boils down to this: the text-oriented reader should consider this book, while the more visually oriented reader can go straight for the 'Good_Wood_Handbook'.	2002-12-11

An important part are the drawings, which say more than a thousand words. It is an atmosphere book, which lets the reader understand something of the relationship between the early Americans and their material (wood). It also shows that wood allows more uses than what passes for woodworking these days.<br />I am a little dubious about the inclusions of trees in the back. The author appears somewhat out of his depth here (he is no Peattie, not by a long way).	2002-10-28

The publisher went all out to make this as luxurious an edition as possible, even providing a plywood box to keep the book in. The printing quality is beautiful and the woods are presented in close to (glorious) natural color. For every wood a separate picture is presented, as is proper, of a transverse, a radial and a tangential surface (ie a cross, a quartersawn and a flatsawn surface). <br />However, lots of quibbles are possible. Firstly the book is misnamed: the title 'The_Woodbook' suggests rather more than is actually covered. It is a reprint (sort of) of 'The_American_Woods' which also was misnamed, presenting only woods grown in the US. It is safe to say that better than 95% of the important woods of the world are not present in 'The_Woodbook'. Secondly it is not an actual reprint. It would be more acurate to say that it is a facsimile reproduction of the woods in one of the copies of 'The_American_Woods' accompanied by modern text. This modern text is an amalgamation of that in 'The_American_Woods' and of that in Sargent's masterpiece. More troublesome in my opinion is the 'artsy' approach with the black background of all the pages (except those which are golden): this blackness is not only on the verge of being depressing, but also is hindering easy reading of the text and outright blocks being able to view the line-drawings of tree morphology on every page (actually I must admit that after browsing through the book several times I only discovered these drawings after having read in the introduction that a drawing was presented on every page. A search then turned them up quickly). The printing quality of these drawings is fairly good but it is very hard to make them out against the background (tilting the book to catch a favorable gleam of light does help). The supporting text is of course quite brief, due to the fact that it must be repeated on the same page in german and french, and still leave room for artistic black (or golden) 'white' space. On the upside, errors in botanical names are actually quite few, at least when disregarding the offences against author names.<br />All in all, this is a very creditable effort, which will be treasured by many who love wood (and especially so in the US).	2002-09-29

I would expect that someone would have come up with something better in the time since the appearance of this book (it first appeared in 1927, reaching the present form in 1956). However everytime I have a question on a scientific word this book produces something useful, usually an answer to my question or otherwise some interesting new bit of information.<br />The only quible I have regards printing quality. The original typography is very ambitious in trying to condense so much information on a page and it suffered a little in this facsimile reprint. Even so printing quality is pretty decent, it is just that it is short of the crispness I would like to see.	2002-06-15

Weeds of the Global Garden&quot; it would seem logical that at more than three times the price this book would offer considerably more. It does offer more text, and color pictures that are a little bigger. In addition there are small maps of California, showing distribution and small line drawings. This book would gain in accessibility if each new species started on a new page, if the line drawings were of a size and quality more aimed to facilitate recognising the species and if a more consistent format of color picture had been used, preferably showing some characteristic details.<br />By the way I do worry about the way both books recommend the use of herbicides like glyphosates (roundup and the like): it sounds as if the cure may be worse than the plague.	2002-03-31

This is a simple, accessible book, that gives a lot of practical information on a problem that is worse than I thought and certainly deserves attention.<br />However, some minor quibles with the other reviews: this is a modest book with photographs that are only modest in size. It falls short of being an attractive book for browsing (a coffee-table book) as well as short of being a field guide (used to ID plants).

It has a brief four-language introduction (german, english, french and spanish) and presents over 30.000 wood names.

However the user should note that current wood name databases contain well over 100.000 names (try the USDA FPL-site) and that quite a few of the botanical names have changed.

Plants have been of immeasurable importance all through the existence of mankind. The book is nicely printed with quite good photographs (although these fall short of being superb). The pictures are supported by brief texts, that touch on a wide body of classical, nordic and celtic mythology. A book of this kind needs an author that either has a superb command of language or an excellent grasp of the topic. Neither seems to be the case here.<br />A clear error that I spotted is with the \\"even ash\\". As the reader will know ash has leaves that are \\"odd pinnate compound\\". Finding a rare aberrant leaf (even pinnate) is counted to be lucky. The author quotes a verse that starts \\"Even ash, I do thee pluck, Hoping thus to meet good luck\\" but apparently failed to read this himself, instead coming up with the ... explanation \\"that plucking an ash leaf brings a boon\\". This sort of error does not inspire confidence in an author.	2002-03-07

Over the millennia many tools have been developed for working wood, but razors are not among them. Using a razor on a dense wood will result in &quot;wood marks&quot; on the razor, that is, in the best case. It can go horribly wrong.<br />The only reasons that only &quot;minor marks&quot; can be seen here is that the haze of sanding marks and sanding dust overlies everything.<br />On the positive side the book is well printed and bound, and of course wood is so beautiful that even the treatment doled out here can not obscure its beauty entirely. Somebody who never saw wood or does not own any proper woodworking tools may be impressed by this book. However such a person would do a lot better with the &quot;Good Wood Handbook&quot; by Jackson &amp; Day (cheaper too!).	2002-03-03

This book contains a wealth of information on the trees & shrubs of America (N-,C- & S-America) and the woods they yield. In amongst the text some plates with B&W pictures of trees; in the back with twentytwo plates of photomicrographs.<br />This went to four editions in the forties (1943-49) and was reprinted at least once later (in 1986: probably this edition). It remains unsurpassed as a source on (N, C & S) America's trees, their timber and wood anatomy, although obviously many of the botanical names in it are obsolete.

A separate section with pretty decent color photographs (39 total). <br />The downside is that this is a guide for North and Central California, with the occasional South Californian species thrown in, which makes it a compromise. Also I don't really like the size: I would have preferred a bigger page size in a less chunky volume. But good value for money overall.	2001-09-15

This work goes deeply into the shrubs and subshrubs of BC and although it is not in the same league as 'Trees in Canada' it does look good.<br />It is a handy size, perhaps a trifle large for use in the field, but its nicely rounded corners compensate significantly. All the species treated are illustrated by a line drawing, which tries to keep a balance between giving botanical detail and giving an all-over morphological image and succeeds fairly well at this. In addition a section of color half tones is provided, which (as so often in this sort of book) gives the impression of having been added as an afterthought. These pictures would have benefitted from being printed at a, say, 30% higher magnification and against a lighter colored background: as it is these tend to drown in the all black pages.

I can well imagine that this booklet will give visitors to Hawai'i much pleasure.<br />I am not so sure about this &quot;reading beforehand&quot; the other reviewer mentions: this will be a pretty brief read.

Both books contain keys printed on a different color paper (mostly: they overrun into the white paper) which are illustrated by small accompanying drawings, which should be very helpful.<br />Apparently both these books sprang from a course being taught in the field and this shows. These books likely will be very useful to those who go out into Southern California. Their usefulness will be much more limited to anyone not actually in this area.<br />Among the species treated in &quot;Deserts&quot; there are very many subshrubs, as opposed to &quot;Coastal Region Mountains&quot; where properly woody species comprise the bulk of the book.	2001-07-29

It is a wonderfully concise text that clearly states principles and gives good practical examples. Also it gives a good overview of the main groups in the APG-system (based on three genes combined with more traditional taxonomical characters). The conciseness is also, in a way, its weak point. It leaves out much that traditionally belongs in basic taxonomy texts, so that it is dubious how well this work is suited as an introduction to plant taxonomy. The many plant groups that are not treated detract from its usefulness as &quot;system book&quot;. Another quibble is that the illustrations (line drawings) are all borrowed from other sources, so that style and quality varies.	2001-07-14

In addition some entries were added and a much brighter cover was adopted.<br />This is a great book for quickly making sure of a not entirely familiar term. This of course is also the big limitation: there is very little background info, which makes it a pretty shallow work. The idea of shallowness is reinforced since it indeed is written purely from a phytographer's point of view: it is limited to morphology only.

This book obviously is handicapped by the absence of illustrations: some line drawings accompanying each species would greatly enhance the usefulness of this book. The color photographs are few (at most one per species), fairly small and many suffer from a dark background: also they are in a separate part and not near the descriptions. This book is not in the same league as John Laird Farrar's work for northern North America.<br />Still the pictures are of a pretty good quality. For most species a distribution map is provided. The volume is well-printed. In many respects it complements Harrar&amp;Harrar's &quot;Guide_to_Southern_Trees&quot;. Maybe these two together make up a complete book?<br />PS I don't dare judge the quality of the descriptions, although I do note that the authors refer to &quot;Betula alba&quot; as if it is an extant name, which is a pretty backward thing to do.	2001-05-25
US	43131377	RYJU3IBYSQJKO	0941936201	173431740	World Woods in Color	Books	2	12	20	N	N	Addendum	To prospective buyers it may be helpful to know that this is a British book: the selection of names is heavily influenced by this. For example &quot;lacewood&quot; is given here in the literal sense, as quartersawn wood of a species with high rays, with a &quot;lacy&quot; ray fleck, originally Platanus spp. Later (although the book omits to mention this) the woods of the Proteaceae (both the Australian silky oaks and the South American roupala) were also so used. The American use of &quot;lacewood&quot; for the Australian silky oaks, however sawn, is somewhat of a misnomer.	2001-04-10
US	43131377	R2YGDYRIVJ64V2	0941936201	173431740	World Woods in Color	Books	2	52	60	N	N	Overdue for a revision	The concept of this book is a good one: a large color picture accompanied by half a page of text. Unfortunately this was not well executed. Leaving aside the text and ignoring the callous mistreatment of scientific names a minimum requirement for a book of this kind is to have proper color pictures. Three steps are involved: 1) the correct wood; 2) exposing a characteristic face of the wood; and 3) proper surfacing. Although there are a number of quite good pictures in this book, it is an easy matter to find major transgressions against each of these three steps. For example the picture given for pink ivory could be replaced by a bit of copper plating for a gain in accuracy. It is impossible to tell if there is a single correct picture for a mahogany (in the wider sense) since no diagnostic faces are shown (however, at least one of these is definitely wrong). For a capital offense against proper surfacing see balsa. All in all something like 40% of the pictures must be replaced for this book to work. This book has the potential to be a handy reference, but a lot of overdue homework must be done first.	2001-03-17

In general I keep well away from gardening books, but when I saw this I could not help myself: the pictures are just too stunning.

The items to be noted are marked by arrows. There are up to four different kinds of arrows in a single (often small) picture and sometimes it is hard to find even the arrows, let alone what they are pointing to. The text is sometimes hard to understand (dr Shigo does not have a gift for a well-turned phrase).<br />Third impression (positive): all the pictures are from authentic material and represent the results of almost thirty years work. Obviously Alex Shigo cares passionately about trees and has applied himself. The text moves from dr Shigo's own field into neighbouring fields and all in all quite a lot of ground is covered to bring tree biology to life for the reader.<br />Fourth impression (negative): whenever dr Shigo moves to another field he is not very careful to use correct terms. He does not shy away from misapplying terms and causing confusion. [To put it popularly: as dr Shigo moves from playing field to playing field he keeps his eye on the ball, but does not pay attention to the rules of the game and commits many fouls.] He invents terms of his own, where this does not appear necessary. There are some weird generalisations here. The Dictionary often is more a restatement of the content of the book than an explanatory aid.<br />Summing up: this is a great book for looking at trees and tree troubles from an unexpected angle, but it falls well short of the standards of a textbook. A good editor could have done invaluable work here.	2001-02-11

When out in the forest he noted that he would be able to tell a lot about the monkeys up in the canopy from the (half)eaten fruits found on the forest floor if only he had a good guide to fruits. So he gladly took up the opportunity to compile such a guide. His first effort was the &quot;Surinaams_vruchtenbook&quot; of which this is the expanded english version.<br />In principle this book covers 1727 species of plants belonging to 99 families (of which 94 are dicot families). Every species is covered (in principle) by a short text giving: botanical name; vernacular names; (sometimes) description of flowers or inflorescence; description of the fruit; &quot;Notes&quot; describing tree habit; area of occurrence.

When after all those rave reviews I bought a copy I was slightly dissappointed. This is an unassuming paperback. There are books on trees you buy for the illustrations: this is not one of them. The illustrations are nice, even tasteful (although I assume they would look a lot better in color) but are nothing more than just that, an illustration of the text.<br />However, when actually reading in the book I was quickly forced to the conclusion that this is a real find. Arthur Plotnik not only is inspired by trees, he also did his home-work (in a big way!) and he surely can write. This book reminds me very strongly of D.C.Peattie, as he would write if he were to live today. What can I add to that?<br />P.S. I can add that this book has an impressive list of references for further reading and a perhaps even more impressive list of internet sites on trees.	2000-12-02

The present book appears an abbreviated and updated version of the earlier one, with distribution maps the most noticeable addition. However I find the earlier one definitely more attractive, if only because the line-drawings are so much clearer in the old book. In Preston's book the reproduction of the drawings is very black, and hence unclear.<br />When comparing this with the magnificent &quot;Trees_of_Canada&quot; by John Laird Farrar (aka &quot;Trees_of_Northern_United_States_and_Canada&quot;) the book by Preston looks shabby indeed. The most kindly thing to be said would seem to be that this is vastly overpriced. Surely the USA can do (a lot) better than this for its trees?	2000-11-30

After the succes of the British version of this book (&quot;Collins_Good_Wood_Guide&quot;) there now are US, French and German versions (and perhaps some more in other languages?).<br />The great thing about the book is the quality of the illustrations which convey a very great deal of information very effectively. I am not entirely sure of the quality of the text, which dips into a very wide range of topics, but owing to the quick-in quick-out style the authors certainly manage to avoid saying anything stupid.<br />My favorite part is the 74 individually photographed wood samples (also including a bit of end-grain and a bit of side-grain, occasionally including the bark) which are faithfully reproduced at an ample size and in glorious color. <br />This 128-page book may not completely satify the wood buff, but it is pretty close to an ideal introduction to woods for anyone starting out doing anything with wood.

This does not go for the text: of the text of the first edition better than 99% is present here, only minutely altered. A six-page new chapter (#16) on Engineered Wood has been added. The chapters on panels and boards are somewhat revised as is the chapter on Finding Wood. In the other chapters text has been swapped around, but has not been changed.<br />The &quot;revision&quot; is mostly in the layout and pictures. The line drawings are substantially unaltered, but of the photographs most were replaced by color photographs of a generally very good quality.<br />As a wood anatomist my attention was drawn to the chapter on identifying wood. Since this subject is covered in much more dept in &quot;Identifying_Wood&quot; (same author, same publisher) there were two ways to go, either 1) eliminate the overlap by replacing this with a presentation of woods by pictures of longitudinal grain (as in &quot;The_Good_Wood_Handbook&quot;) which would have been user-friendly and would have had my preference or 2) upgrade this book to the level of its companion. The latter strategy has been chosen and the black&amp;white end grain pictures of the 1st edition have been replaced by pictures found in &quot;Identifying_Wood&quot;. These are reproduced here at a higher magnification, allowing more detail to be seen. The selection of woods has been altered, with more tropical woods included.<br />Summing up: although this is a lot more attractive book than the first edition it is only worth replacing that first edition if the book is to be used frequently (for example as a teaching aid). For those who think this is a fairly expensive book I can recommend &quot;The_Good_Wood_Handbook&quot; by Jackson &amp; Day which although much more modest in every respect is good value-for-money, and is a more accessible book.	2000-11-24

This book will make a lovely gift.<br />My major criticism is that the pecan tree, as a tree, is almost lost from sight, with only a single color picture of a tree and no picture of leaves or flowers (however, nuts are featured infull color). Also the bit on the botanical name is ... Well, let's say if it was a recipe it would yield an inedible product.	2000-10-26

This certainly is an attractive coffee table-book which may well inspire those who browse through it into making better use of wood than before.    As an enyclopedia it certainly does not make the grade. Obviously nobody with a botanical background was involved here. On page 20 is a remark about 'apetalous' trees that if ever I decide to award a price for the most-nonsensical-botanical-statement-ever will be a strong contender. The writers failed to pursue a consistent way of writing botanical names. Glancing through the book I note various errors in the history of the use of wood.     In addition the wood pictures, although of the same general size that is cute in \\"Identifying_Wood\\" by Aidan Walker (see there), a book derived from this, are pretty smallish on this big page size. I feel uncomfortable about some of the pictures which appear hardly typical of the woods they supposedly represent, and indeed some were replaced in the little book. As \\"Identifying_Wood\\" is not a bad book but unsuited for identifying wood, so is this \\"Encyclopedia_of_Wood\\" unsuited as a reference.    I don't want to give the impression that it is riddled with errors (I have seen much worse), but it falls well short of the level of, say, \\"The_International_Book_of_Wood\\" (1976) let alone of an encyclopedia.    P.S. I do hate the clumsy square shape. Obviously it was not meant to ever come off that coffee table: it decidedly would sit awkward on a shelf among real reference works.    ---------  Second edition (dec 2006)    It is interesting to compare the 2005 second edition with the 1989 first edition. Firstly, the second edition has changed from the rather clumsy square shape to a more convential shape that will fit better on the bookshelf. Secondly, the second edition has retained the heart of the book, the descriptions of 150 woods, but has shifted from presenting two woods per page to one wood per page. This means that more of the book is taken up by these descriptions, and this has been compensated for by deleting the parts on crafted wood, which actually were among the more attractive parts of the book. What has been retained are the parts explaining trees and the structure of wood. These were rather riddled with errors in the first edition, and this does not appear to have been improved. The botanical information is even more out of date than the first time round (botany is on the move).    The 150 woods presented here are not quite the 150 of the first edition, although mostly they are. The presentation of these woods is much affected by the large color pictures: something like a third of the page is taken up by a color photograph of a longitudinal surface. Picture quality is fairly good, but perhaps a little on the dark side. Not always so good is the selection of actual woods to be photographed. It is not possible to understand how anybody could have mistaken the wood on page 46 for Kauri, short of complete blindness. But this is hardly the only failure to match the wood to the description. The descriptions themselves do not appear to have been changed, although the new woods of course do represent new content. This new content has been provided by Nick Gibbs, who also authored the \\"Real wood bible\\". The error on pau rosa in the latter book has been incorporated here as well. It is safe to say that all the errors on the identity of wood that are traditionally present in books aimed at the woodworker have been faithfully perpetuated here, yet again.    It is curious to note that although the \\"Real wood bible\\" (or its British equivalent \\"Wood handbook\\") share an author and a photographer, and were produced by the same publishing group as the present book, there is a quite notable difference in picture quality. The pictures in the \\"Real wood bible\\" are distinctly better in qualityand more faithful to the original wood than in this book.    All in all, the second edition is not really an improvement on the first edition, losing the information on crafted wood (which made this a good coffee-table book), adopting a color scheme for the world maps that is a lot less clear, etc. Everything that was bad about the first edition appears to have been retained, except the small size of the wood pictures. The second edition loses a star.     For anybody looking for only the one book to own the \\"Real wood bible\\" is a much better choice. As the selection of woods is slightly different between these two books (and different pictures appear to have been used throughout) it may be worth owning both, anyway.	2000-10-19

Excellently photographed and excellently printed this volume gives a good impression of how beautiful petrified wood can be. This work is perfectly suited as a coffee table book.<br />As a wood anatomist I cannot help feeling that an even more beautiful book could be produced by shifting the focus to anatomy: when magnified these woods would look even better.

He is thus quite qualified to do what he did here: extensively revise &quot;A  Gardener's Handbook of Plant Names&quot; by A.W.Smith (1963, still  available as a Dover reprint of 1997). Facts were checked, errors  eliminated, additions made. The typography was modernised. The help in  pronunciation limited to stressing syllables.<br />This book presents a wealth  of information on plant names: it lists 6000 botanical names and 3000  vernacular names, in addition to quite a bit of background information. It  is limited to plant names of importance to gardeners, but this is not so  limiting as might be, since by this is meant &quot;gardeners  worldwide&quot;, including those on the Southern Hemisphere. Although I  wish it were slightly longer, this book surely gives value for money.	2000-07-29

Hardcover, 22,9 x 30,4 x 1,2cm, 44 pp, illustrated by black&amp;white halftones. The woods treated are separated in six categories, by application. For each application a brief survey is given of what wood properties are desirable.<br />Amount of data given per wood varies. At best is provided: German trade name, scientific name, (occasionally) a synonym, other trade names, natural distribution, general appearance of the wood, properties, typical use. Most woods are illustrated by a 8x12 cm photomicrograph of the end grain (transmitted light), of excellent quality.<br />By today's standards of lavishly illustrated books perhaps a trifle sober. Color photographs of flat sawn and quarter sawn woods would have been nice, as would have been photomicrographs of tangential and radial sections. Might also have contained a little more in the way of detail useful in identifying the treated woods. Nevertheless it does contain a great deal of information, presented very concisely.	2000-06-18

Fittingly the book starts off  with a description of white pine and the birth of what is now the USA. In  short anyone who claims to care for trees or to be interested in how the  USA came to be and who is not familiar with the contents of this book is in  serious danger of appearing to be a charlatan.<br />[Quality of the reprint  could be better; actually this book deserves to be in hardcover.

Its printing history speaks for itself. First published in 1977; second revised edition by Dr E.J.Moll in 1984,  third impression 1988 (when 12 pages were added with updates on  nomenclature); ninth impression in 1997. What can I add to that?<br />This is  an identification key and reference work to Southern African trees, giving  per species a short description, a distribution map and one (or more) line  drawings of a detail, usually a leaf (sometimes a fruit, sometimes both.  Upon occasion a tree habit). Names listed include full scientific name, in  some cases synonyms, always an english name and usually an afrikaans name.  There are close to a thousand pages of this, supplemented with over a  hundred pages of color illustrations (both photographs and colored  drawings).<br />Compared to some of the magnificently illustrated books on  trees that are now available this work looks somewhat modest. However the  absence of an abundance of photographs does mean that all these trees can  be captured in a single binding of a handy size and weight, at a quite  affordable price. [Might be due for an update, but I sure won't volunteer  to undertake it. That would be a whole lot of work! ]	2000-06-14

Mostly from the inside of the tree, but also quite a few pictures from the outside. The picture  quality mostly is very good, especially when classic topics are  photographed.<br />Dr Shigo also markets two slide packages (&quot;Tree  anatomy, above ground&quot;, &quot;Tree anatomy, below ground&quot;) with  many of the same pictures. In conjunction with &quot;A new tree  biology&quot; these are intended to help raise awareness of how trees live  and grow.<br />On the minus side: the accompanying text is not always a 100%  correct and the selection of pictures is perhaps not an optimal balance,  both in what parts of the tree are illustrated as in what species of trees  are selected. Also it is a fairly expensive book (less than a 100  pictures). Nevertheless a very impressive atlas.	2000-06-12

Initially this key utilised punched cards, but it has (of course) been computerised. Note that the actual key  is not included here.  The present work is intended to describe and  illustrate the 91 (99) wood anatomical characters used in this key.  Illustrations are 66 half-tone plates of four (sometimes two or three)  6x9cm black&amp;white photomicrographs: note that the plates belonging to  fig 62 &amp; 63 were inadvertently interchanged. In addition there is one  (historical) plate illustrating the author in his lab.<br />Since the  characters used are fairly orthodox this book can also be used as a  illustrated list of wood anatomical characters, as an alternative or a  supplement to the IAWA-list (issued from Leiden: eevn@euronet.nl). Since  this CSIRO key is published in Australia, the woods illustrated tend to be  from Australia or its adjacent areas.	2000-06-07

There are 1605 such entries of four micrographs each.<br />This  Atlas is a compromise in many respects, containing very many pictures in a  single book. The pictures indeed are a bit crowded together and indeed are  a bit small, especially since these are halftones. <br />Also the book is  distinctly biased towards woods from (the vicinity of) Australia. For those  whose interest is restricted to the more common hardwoods only there are  better books on the market.

The vast majority of these is not used at present, or only in a very limited sense. In 402 pages, with 563 figures, the book lists species in 1) Eurasia and  Japan, 2) North America and 3) the Southern Hemisphere. Each species  treated is illustrated by: a line drawing (morfology), a photograph of the  habitus, one or more climate diagrams, a distribution map, a  photomicrograph of a cross section (often at 40x) and some 'radiograms'  (strips showing many growth rings). Note that these pictures are not all  always present for each and every species: the especially promising species  get more attention than the less promising. The quality of these drawings  and black&white pictures is pretty good, but perhaps not quite up to  the standard that might be expected at this price. Obviously this book will  be of most use to those working on dendrochronoloy: the professional and  serious amateur.

This is quite correct. Dr Carlquist has made a career of studying wood of small diameter stems: shrubs, subshrubs, liana's, etc. He has brought together an  enormous body of knowledge on the variation in their wood anatomy and came  up with many a theory to explain this. This book takes stock of his work up  to 1988. Since many of his conclusions are controversial this work should  only be read within hand's reach of an extended reference library: food for  thought for the specialist!<br />Note: for those interested in practical wood  anatomy (wood identification) the book by R.Bruce Hoadley is a good  introduction.

For the practical purpose of how to handle wood and to predict how a given piece of  wood will behave R.Bruce Hoadley's 'Understanding Wood' is the book to read  and to have.  For those who want to go beyond the directly practical this  is the book. It is reasonably easy to read, at least for those who remember  some physics from high school, especially because it is lavishly  illustrated with clarifying drawings. The book takes a look at the  mechanical forces that trees are subject to and explains how the tree  counters by optimizing its wood to deal with those forces. It does this at  several levels, from the tree as a whole down to the orientation of  microfibrils in the cell wall. By looking at a tree as a mechanical machine  it complements explanations of a tree as a machine to transports fluids,  such as put forth by Zimmerman e.a.<br />Note that this book is one of several  by Mattheck e.a. which all have the same basic content, and even the same  drawings, but which differ in the groups targeted. There is a very similar  one aimed at those involved in tree upkeep, which shows how defects in  trees can be diagnosed from looking at the tree, the patterns in the bark,  etc. <br />However, this book is definitely the one to read for those  primarily interested in wood, and its mechanical properties. It might well  be destined to become a classic in its field!	2000-04-25
