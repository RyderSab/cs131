It's tough deciding which one to cook, in fact. What I love about it: The recipes are not complicated, and do not call for obscure, hard to find ingredients. She explains things very well and offers helpful tips. Many of the recipes are very inexpensive, too.  In addition, most of the recipes don't have big long ingredient lists, which is a big plus in my opinion. And they're not loaded with fat, either. Yet they still taste wonderful. My two favorites are the parsnip soup (which I never would've expected to like!) and the butternut squash with lime, garlic and ginger. I can't praise this book enough.	2005-10-10

It's a literary tour around Ojibwe country, some of which she takes with her baby's father, a spiritual leader, and of course, her baby, who the animals seem intrigued by. It's an unusual, hard to describe book - not quite a mere travelogue, but also a glimpse into the Ojibwe life, a survey of the land, a little about her family, and the efforts of a man to bring more books to the reservation. This effort continues today, and in LE's view is a vital endeavor. I totally agree.	2005-10-10

I think I found this book by Louise Erdrich possibly the most consistently interesting book in the series, all of which I enjoyed. There's never a dull passage, and honestly the characters are easier to understand, if not always relate to, than a memorable but so \\"strange\\" (for lack of a better word) character than Fleur Pillager.  I didn't like Jack Mauser one bit, though, but maybe I wasn't supposed to like him. And I'm glad I didn't read the Publisher's Weekly review before reading this, either, considering all the spoilers.	2005-09-26

Anyway, this book is just so ham handed with its stereotypes and its \\"message\\". Men bad, women good, earth good, natural herbs good, got it. I am fairly liberal politically, quite liberal on environmental issues, so the theme of the book sounded appealing, but the author has no sense of character development, or making charaters complex, real people; the male characters especially are so one-dimensional. And \\"that scene\\" with the sisters is repugnant, not to mention completely superfluous. Skip it.	2005-09-19

I didn't read her fiction until after I read her book \\"Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country\\", which is nonfiction. Anyway, I really enjoyed this book, and while it is somewhat impossible to describe the complete plot (and saying \\"Lipsha is in love with Shawnee\\" doesn't do it justice), Lipsha is developed into a sympathetic figure, and Lyman is also rounded out more. It's amazing how LE can spin an interesting narrative out of (mostly) ordinary events.  I would love to read more about Lipsha and the other, younger members of the families. They seem so real now, after reading the other books such as \\"Tracks\\", \\"Love Medicine\\", etc.	2005-09-06

I truly can't decide if I believe Martha's father actually did molest her, or not. (Only she knows, not any of the strangers reviewing this book. Even her siblings wouldn't be able to verify whether the father molested her.)However, the real reason I picked up this book was to learn some more about the LDS church, and learning about Smith's \\"translation\\" of the Egyptian text, not to mention his supposed receiving of the golden plates, and other things Mormons espouse was worth the time spent reading this.   That being said, her New-Agey spirituality does get annoying at times.  So if like me you're curious about the Mormons, read this book!	2005-08-22

No matter how much you think you know about some of the right-wing windbags like Coulter, O'Reilly, et al., you'll learn tons of new stuff about what sleazes they really are.  Note to the skeptics: in this book, Al and TeamFranken expose, as the title says, Lies and the Lying Liars.  It is NOT merely a trashing of conservatives, like Coulter trashes Democrats en masse, but a look at the truth about people such as Ms. Coulter, Hannity, and the aforementioned O'Reilly.  With actual facts and research, not cliches and well, slander.  I hope everyone who read books such as &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot; and &quot;Slander&quot; will read this book instead.

She is a real person, not some stereotyped &quot;limousine liberal&quot; or other right-wing invective.  She is a PHD, but comes from a very working class upbringing, which I noticed most of the negative reviewers failed to mention. Another false criticism levied against this book I've seen a lot is that she &quot;condescends&quot; to the people she works with. Not even slightly true. Neither is the bit about her speaking admiringly about the Communists. I guess when you can't criticize a book for any real reason, just make up a lie, huh?  Anyway this book should be required reading for all. I think a lot of people really don't appreciate what it's like to poor and stuck - what kinds of things can go wrong, and what can bust a skimpy budget - things like, oh, medical care, transportation, housing, food.  Little pittances like that.  Barbara E. shows how things can go wrong for the working poor, and that not everyone can make it.  This book may make you wonder how our government has the funds necessary to bomb other countries, but not the funds necessary to feed hungry people, or give health care to its own citizens. It sure made me think differently.   She's a terrific writer.  I really hope to read more of her work, and I'm hoping for another great expose!	2003-08-06

Hannity offers nothing new in this waste of trees.  &quot;Liberals bad - conservatives good&quot;.  Wow, that's a new message coming from your side, Sean. HIs words, his radio show, and his TV show are a waste of time and will dull the senses. A gem I heard last night on his radio show was him criticizing Sen. John Kerry, who was questioning the pre-war intelligence. Hannity said: &quot;Who is this guy to cricitize?&quot; Well, Sean, he's an American citizen, a Senator, and a Vietnam veteran to boot.  Who are you, Toadboy? (Incidentally, I am NOT a Kerry supporter, but would Toad have said &quot;who is this guy&quot; about Sen. John McCain? I think not. Just shows his bias.)Hannity is merely another dittohead who poses in front of a flag to show how much of a patriot he is.  Feh. And he's religious, as he endlessly reminds us.  (By the way, Mr. Supercatholic Sean, Catholics do not believe in Creationism.)	2003-07-17

Some people seem to find it hard to believe that a person can't &quot;get by&quot; on minimum wage, or that people get stuck in low-paying jobs - some claim that &quot;everyone starts at minimum wage in life, but they get promoted and make more&quot;, etc.  That doesn't always happen, or even happen that often.   Ms. Ehrenreich's book shows the struggles she faced in just a short term experiment, but imagine trying to do it for the long haul - there are other crises that occur in the lives of working people - such as, lack of medical insurance - a HUGE problem - and car troubles, to name a couple.  In this book, Ms. Ehrenreich was working during the warmer months - God knows what she may have encountered during the winter in Maine or Minnesota!But this terrific book gives a glimpse into the lives of the working poor, even with everyone seemingly going right for Ms. Ehrenreich.    By the way, several reviewers have claimed that she has 'contempt' for the poor, and has a snobby, yuppie-ish attitude.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I don't know why people make false allegations in a book review, I suspect it's to dissuade others from reading the book and deciding for themselves.     Read this book, you'll be glad you did.    And pass on a couple copies to your state reps, senators, etc.   Teach them a few things.    I look forward to future works by Barbara Ehrenreich after reading this - she's wonderful.	2003-01-09

This book should be required reading for lawmakers - actually, lawmakers should have to try to live on low wage work by themselves for a month, and see if they make it!  (Especially those who were born into money - most of them just cannot relate to the struggles of the working class.)  Oh, and to the reviewer who claimed that Barbara Ehrenreich used a racial slur - \\"niggardly\\" means stingy or cheap.  It's not a racist term, stupid.  Buy a dictionary.  And her remark that Latinos \\"hog all the crap jobs and housing\\" was sarcasm.  Really. What is wrong with some people?	2002-12-08

While some reviewers have put CM down for too much detail, or a \\"Martha Stewart\\"ish tone, I disagree.  Right on page 15, she writes that she intended the book to be very thorough, and that some experienced homemakers may find she has included too many basic details, as she puts it. Two pages later, she writes that she has given more detail than the reader might actually need.  So don't be put off by the detail - it's a reference book, folks. Not really meant to be just read, but consulted on an ongoing basis. Now, the review.<br />In the beginning, she makes really great points about how it's the care one gives a home, not the home decor, that make a place comfortable.  I think this may be the most important message in the book.  It seems like too many people just rush out and buy new \\"things\\" instead of caring for what they have.  The subsequent chapters are loaded with info on everything from food, fabrics, and photos, and the care thereof.  Then she goes into safety and law issues.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough. You will learn a lot.	2002-08-28

(In fact, I think all execs and lawmakers should have to live the way Ehrenreich did for one year - perhaps things would change.)<BR>   I loved this book. BE's experiment shows the struggles a healthy, educated white woman with a car, without kids in tow undergoes trying to make it on skimpy wages.  Plus, she also knew it was temporary. Now, put yourself in the shoes of someone, often with children, an old junk car (or no car) who has to live the way she did permanently.  Ehrenreich goes into detail about the choices she and her coworkers have to make each day, and she also reveals the degradation employers inflict upon low-wage workers - drug testing, rules such as \\"no drinking water\\", etc.    The  reader may even be tempted to boycott that chain store she worked at, like I do.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-08-12

WRONG.  Eric Tyson simplifies advice on insurance, debt, wills, real estate, etc. that applies to most &quot;regular&quot; people. And, in cases where a person with special circumstances, or substantial wealth, would benefit from a different strategy, Tyson lets us know. He does not prescribe one-size-fits-all advice.  He exposes some financial scams, and reveals some &quot;impartial&quot; sources of guidance are not unbiased at all.  I give this book my highest recommendation.  Even if you barely have any finances to speak of, this book will be a great source of information.	2002-06-19

My dog and I try to visit at least 3 new places a month, besides our old favorites, and this book is what we use. One note: Lynn Woods is now an on-leash spot, as of the summer of 2000. But don't worry, there are many other great spots you can go offleash, even close to Boston, the city that never met a leash law it didn't like.  I only wish this book covered all of Massachusetts, or even southern New Hampshire! Maybe the authors will sleuth out a few more places to enjoy, hint, hint.  One note: you may want to bring a road atlas with you, because sometimes street signs are down and not replaced, etc., especially in smaller towns.  I cannot recommend this book strongly enough.

Some of the negative reviews are disingenuous	This book is an inspiration to help you save money. Kathryn F says &quot;I won't dumpster dive, reuse meat trays or save dryer lint.&quot; Amy D. doesn't do any of this;she dove a couple times as part of her research for an article. She doesn't give out money advice like &quot;buy gov't bonds&quot; as others said. As for mealtimes, I agree with her &quot;old fashioned&quot; method of feeding kids, not letting them control the family diet.   What Amy DOES do is give examples of ways to save, and articles on calculating real costs of things, etc. Her writing will inspire your own creativity regarding saving money, appropriate for your own situation. The fact that they saved the cash they did, living in expensive New England is amazing, believe me. She outlines options for you, it's up to you to decide what's best - are you truly desperate financially, just want to cut back a bit, or somewhere in between?  Personally, what this book has done for me is that it has shifted my values a bit, I am far less interested in having &quot;things&quot;, and more into enjoying life through direct experiences - hiking in the mountains, being outdoors. I'm not into the domestic scene like Amy is. But the beauty of the book is you can adapt the advice. Please check it out for yourself, even at the library.

They come across as very condescending, as well.   They tell a lot about how they started the business and so forth, but they  never reveal anything about their personal feelings besides lauding  themselves as misunderstood pioneers. It would be nice to have a little  glimpse into their personal lives beyond that Anna drank a lot of coffee  for 20 years. It's like they think they're &quot;above&quot; the rest of  us; they do seem to regard themselves as Renaissance women, Anna  especially. Maybe they just have no warmth, but it's nice to reveal a  little of one's self to connect with the audience. They definitely come off  as being snobbish,yet somehow insecure,uptight, status-seeking throwbacks.   They throw in a lot of quotes from famous people, and ideas from classic  books and philosophers. Anna describes the books on her recommended reading  list with a lot of multisyllabic words. It's like they have an inferiority  complex about their general knowledge - I say inferiority because no one  who was secure about their level of knowledge would trumpet it so much.   And while they make a big deal about female accomplishment in their family,  they still describe their instructors as engaged, married, and so forth.   The instructors have some good advice and seem very real and likable; where  is Susan Harris? She is the reason I bought the subsequent tapes after  Volume I. I know she still works there. Like I said, there are some buried  pieces of very helpful advice, such as that you have to get to 60% of  failure to grow muscle.  Skip the book and buy their tapes, especially  Volume 3, Better Body and Buns, and Tough Cardio Mix.	2000-08-15

And even if all it does is make you hesitate  before you waste money, it's worth it.  But I bet you'll get a lot more out  of it than that.  And for the person in MA, keep an open mind about things.	1999-12-28

It's the only one I've ever seen, but it's fantastic, with invaluable health and training tips, as well as history. And it is worth the price if only for the photos, but there's so much more.  My PWD is a  total joy for our whole family - I don't want the breed to become too  popular and suffer for it, but I wish I had a dozen of these dogs! And they  don't bother people w/allergies, they are wonderful.  This book will be  very helpful for owners and would-be owners.	1999-12-14
