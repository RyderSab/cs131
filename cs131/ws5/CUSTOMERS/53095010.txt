If you are a Dreamweaver guru, you will find mistakes in this book. If you are a Dreamweaver beginner you will be lost before you get out of the first chapter because the book persists is telling you how to do cool website things, but in html code. Dreamweaver's strength is that you rarely have to deal with code. Reading this book, you'd never know that. Rather than simplifying Dreamweaver, this books makes it seem more complicated.	2003-01-02

It's a bulletproof system, but those of us with years of experience on Macintoshes can get lost in the new system. And those people who are buying their first Mac are also lost because Apple's in-the-box manual is terribly scanty. Pogue is the best of the computer writers -- he doesn't bore people who don't need instruction in how to click a mouse and yet he doesn't lose the beginners either. With this book you are prepared to get the most out of what arguably is the most advanced operating system in the world. The book is intelligently organized and has what you need in time of computer crisis -- a great index. As a bonus, Pogue's book is eminently readable and occasionally witty (not silly like some of the forced-humor computer books, but truly witty).	2003-01-02

The number is actually around 25. This book is an encyclopedia of Discworld chracters (Death, Cohen the Barbarian and so forth), plus Discworld places and concepts. It's a funny book, but you won't get much out of it if you aren't into the series. If you have read several of the series, it's a great resource -- and, like everything by Pratchett, immensely witty.	2002-08-13

No, I never met him, but I've read his essays for years and he was a brilliant man who wrote to you as if you were smart, too, but you just didn't know the inside terminology. This is the last book of his collected science essays from Natural History magazine, but his subjects are much wider than science. There's a lot of biology here, and a lot of why you should care about biology, but the most important thing is that this book -- like all of Steve's books -- is like listening to a friend who's fascinating. Each chapter here was a Natural History column and the subjects range from baseball to evolution. I know this is rambling on and I'm sorry. I will miss him, my smart friend Steve. As much as you can love someone you know only from his writing, I loved him. That's the kind of writer -- and scientist -- he was. He cared passionately about knowledge.	2002-05-21

Pratchett satirizes Zen, mathematics ( he may have written the only characterin all of literature based on a mathematical bifurcation), death and Death, kung-fu movies, accountants and a dozen more. If you've read a couple of the series, you'll understand this one. It does start a bit slowly, but Pratchett has a lot of setting up to do before all hell breaks loose with the Five Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Yes, five. There is just *a lot* in this book. No wizards, though.	2002-05-02

Quammen's area of storytelling is the world of nature, from ants to rhinos.

The chapters in the book appeared earlier as columns in Outside magazine.	2002-05-02

It's pretty, but it can be infuriating, especially to those -- like me -- who've put in years learning the old system and now discover that this new Unix-based Mac system does everything differently. Enter David Pogue, the best explainer and hand-holder on the planet. This is the book Apple should have included with OS X (thus the title). It will get you through the complexities -- and explain the joys -- of OS X. And it will calm you when you are ready to scream, because Pogue will tell you what to do, clearly and cheerfully.	2002-02-06

And then, for most of us, the world caught up with the sense of wonder. We were on the moon. We were cloning. We had the Internet. This book, this literally marvelous book, re-awakens that sense of wonder. Cohen and Stewart's aliens are really *alien.* The science of 200 years from now is not only plausible but seems inevitable. The plot is great; you care about the characters (who actually grow by book's end -- something rare in SF), but it's the science that raises the hairs on your arms. Read a chapter by Cohen -- I presume it's Cohen as he's a reproductive biologist -- on how the aliens reproduce and it's the biological equivalent of listening to Bach knock out a clever etude. And if all this doesn't light you up, the book also has a fey English wit. You won't be disappointed -- it's one of those books that's fun to read again and again.	2002-02-06

Jewish mysticism is different from New Age mystricism in that Jewish mysticism is grounded in text -- and letters. From there, it takes flight.

This is not an unbiased history, nor does it pretend to be. It is an interesting -- and often saddening -- adjunct to the American history you were taught in school. You will learn from this book, but you may not like what you learn, especially if your politics tend toward the conservative. However, don't think the liberals come off as heroes to Zinn, either. As I said, it can be a saddening book. Even so, it is one all Americans should read, if only to learn from the past. It is a fascinating read -- in addition to being a scholar Zinn is a fine novelist, and he knows how to keep you interested.	2001-09-30

The book has several strengths -- first is McClelland's astonishing knowldge, next is his ability to explain complex things in terms even a beginner can understand, third is the brilliant way the information is organized. Face it, no matter how much knowlege a book contains, if you can't find the knowledge it's useless to you. The publisher and book designer make McClelland's information always easy to find, even if you are looking for some obscure feature like using the Color Range command to make a mask. No matter what your skill level, this book will open the Photoshop world further to you. I'm a graphics professional and I have a dozen Photoshop books on my shelf -- and this is the one I always pull out.	2001-09-20

If more how-to books were written this skillfully, fewer of us graphic artists would suffer depressions.	2001-09-17

It will take you several chapters to -- as musicians say -- catch her riff. She is asking why God would allow horrors to exist. To a nation stunned by the horror at the World Trade Center, this is a gut question. Dillard has no easy answers, but her journey looking for an answer is immensely helpful for those of us who lack her reed-like sensitivity. She looks at the same problem as does Ecclesiastes in the Bible -- why do bad things happen to good people -- and comes up with a similar answer that there is no simple why. Dillard's range of knowledge is breathtaking, but it's the way she weaves things together that makes pure magic. If you are confused and saddened, this book will help you deal with the right questions. It's not a self-help book, it's a mix of Job and Ecclesiastes keening at the sky: &quot;WHY!?&quot;	2001-09-17

That part is fascinating and the science is crackling. Alas, some of the subplots have dangling ends and sloppy thinking. An example: One main character's husband apparently suicides, disappearing on a small boat. A few pages later she says that his body was found and it was in such bad shape &quot;they identified him by his wedding band.&quot; Whoa! If you want a character like that to be really dead, you ID him by his dental charts. So the reader keeps waiting for the husband's reappearance. He stays gone. In the last 50 or so pages, the book goes magical after the birth of the evolution-jumped baby, who can speak from birth. She's fascinating, but the book too soon cuts away to an end that semaphores &quot;wait for the sequel.&quot; Not a bad idea.	2001-09-04

The book -- with lots of illustrative pictures -- is aimed at teaching younger players, but has good fundamental advice for players of any age (or gender, for that matter).

This is the sexiest of the six books with Ms. Plum, although it is very tame by contemporary standards. Sexy, yes; but funny sexy. At one point Plum's boyfriend says if they don't get into bed soon, he will self-combust. &quot;I self-combusted in the shower this morning,&quot; replies Plum, whose sex life is severely complicated because her pistol-toting, Spandex-wearing grandma moved in with her. The entire book is funny, but there are places in the book that will cause you to laugh so hard the people around you will think you've lost your mind. That is, unless they've also read this book. Then they will say, &quot;The place where the dog who ate the the prunes got kidnapped?&quot; and you'll say &quot;Woooo! Heeeee!&quot; and such.

[What in the heck] does it mean? Well, it means the study of knowledge, and Johnson in this book makes that study fascinating. Most people who question scientific laws are cranks. NYTimes science writer Johnson knows science, and he questions how faith in the unknown -- no one's seen an electron, much less a quark -- quietly permeates science, and why. He parallels that faith with the religious faith of Native Americans in New Mexico, weaving the two brilliantly together. The man's a bloomin' genius. He's also a writer that holds your interest as as strongly as does, say, Tony Hillerman. A page-turner about epistomology. Amazing. This is a great book.	1997-12-24
