The \\"translation\\" is awful, the exposition poor and the browsing back and forth looking for figures cited in the text is rather cumbersome. There is a void (of books) in this genra and in defense skills in specific. Some of them are geared towards the hard-core pro/semi-pro, then there's a huge gap in the middle, and then there are books geared towards the beginners and \\"dummies.\\" Those of us who love to play and watch this sport find ourselves at a loss when it comes to good self-coaching/game improvement literature. This book, as said above, is not one I would recommend to someone fitting that \\"intermediate\\" level.	2005-09-24

As an experienced php developer, I found this book to be very solid for those who already have a clue about both MySQL and php. In spite that the author tried to introduce both thoroughly, if you don't have an idea as to how programming/scripting languages work, you might find yourself a bit at odds with what the author is explaining.   As already mentioned by another reviewer, the book completely igonores php5's OO-model which is a bastion of php5.  Nonetheless, I think this is one of the best books I've read that goes a long way to introduce and expand upon the symbiotic relationship between php and MySQL. Very good, solid book if you are novice/intermediate or advanced developer looking for a handy reference. Good, knowledgeable author.	2005-07-22

However, if you have a learning style where you can learn and catch a pattern by doing rather than reading in abstract, then this book will definitely will get you up and running in a jiff. The authors write decently and are consistent throughout this primer. The companion site, though, should be updated and should be redesigned, in my opinion. Of course, after you \\"master\\" this book, you SHOULD get a more thorough, abstract book where you can actually learn the intricacies and the inner works of this very powerful client-side scripting language without having to worry that you won't be able to apply it.	2005-07-12

The GUI pretty and all the gizmos and widgets, etc are pretty as well. However, I'm not really interested in that part (since they have existed in Linux for ages), but rather I was interested in the inner-workings of the BSD subsystem and kernel. I am also interested in XCode2 (GCC3, GCC4) and native 64-bit support. Since OS X is definitely delivered with the consumer in mind, most of the real power of the OS lie beneath its hood. This is when this book comes unbelievably handy. Very well written, well organized, very few typos, and with invaluable tips and tools all explained in a coherent manner. A must for unix people moving/using OS X.	2005-07-12

The authors do an excellent job at uncovering what lies beneath the hood, so to speak. The first few chapters are a great refresher for those of us who come from a different programming language background. The intorduction to OO programming and patterns is one of the best I've read coming from a non-academic source. Thereafter is when the real substance surfaces. Showing how to take full advantage of not only PHP5's OO, but also of the C-based Zend engine and PEAR modules. The chapters on database connectivity are absolutely outstanding. The book is well written, and in some parts goes down to the time and space complexity and also the data structures used by the engine. Very good book overall. The only reason I did not give five stars to this excellent primer is because I found at least five or six typographical errors in the first few chapters. Not a big deal, just a matter of personal preference. <br />A must for PHP power developers.	2005-05-25

As a programmer coming from Java I found this book to be quite helpful and straight forward. The chapter on pointers and references does a superb job at getting the reader to understand the concept and to be able to apply it. The appendices are also great with lots of handy information.

However ...	the cover of this book asserts that the book covers PHP 4 and 5. This is, a blatant marketing ploy. The core of PHP5 which its Object-Oriented approach was not explained or even alluded to.  As for what this book is, it definitely is a great introductory book. Even if you an advanced programmer using a different language, migrating to PHP can be somewhat tough and perhaps even counterintuitive. However, Mr. Ullman does an exceptional job at getting you up an running without trying to sound overly smart (by using a thesaurus, like most computer-book authors). He has a no-fuss approach. Very easy to understand. Great for people who are tired of 900-page+ computer books with nothing but rubbish inside them. Highly recommind for beginners as well for those who are coming from a different programming language background.	2005-05-16

As a concerned scientist and married man, I find this primer to be both very informative and very entertaining. This book definitely is not for the prude or for the ber-conservative, neither is for guys looking for pornographic material in books. It is, as someone mentioned, very clinical and factual yet posed in a frank and even raw manner. The pictorials are shocking and graphic, but they're so with a pourpose and for a reason. And that reason is that sex can and is one of innermost desires that conservative-minded people have tried to obfuscate for ages. We all live and breath sex. Humans are sexual beings, and any notion to the contrary is just ignorance. I don't have a teen-aged son or daughter, but if I did, I'd certainly entertain the idea of giving him or her a copy (depending on their maturity). I myself have learned many \\"tricks\\" that might have seemed obvious to me and never tried thinking that I was just being nonsensical and puerile, but have turned out to be of great satisfaction.  <br />Further, the unassuming and candid tone of the author(s) is very artsy and literate. The only one reason I gave 4 stars is the fact that I think they went a little too far with the plethora of euphemisms for masturbation. But, with no qualms, I recommend this book to all of you (teens, adults, old-timers, etc.)	2005-03-15

Hi, <br /> <br />When I read a few pages of this book at my local bookstore, I was impressed. The author is eloquent and candid, the code was legible and easy to follow, and the price was reasonable. It all was good until I started to notice that Mr. Gilmore was giving such a trivial examples that I really can't find much use for them. The book's subtitle \\"From Novice To Professional\\" is a blatant exageration. As a programmer, I could tell Mr. Gilmore did not address any advanced subject with any emphasis whatsoever.  <br />One thing that bugged me quite a bit is the fact that I found at least 3 hypothetical outputs that were wrong with respect to what the code sample should have produced (all in the first 4 chapters). To me, that's unacceptable. When writing code, one has to think in layers and keep in mind the behavior of pretty much all of the routines and values of variables at any given time. If you are told by the author that  function x(foo) sorts foo in ascending order but the output is in descending order then what gives? should you use that function to sort ascending- or descending-wise? <br />The coverage of simple programming principles is laughable (id est what's a queue and a stack, loops, time complexity, etc) or right out non-existant. <br />It's a good book for BEGINNERS (in the most literal sense of the word), but pretty much of no use for intermediates or advanced  users.	2005-03-01

However, what I don't like about the book is that the author uses the Java API to illustrate all his examples. Yes, this might be easier than to come up with a new implementation, but, is definitely not a good learning tool. I want to know what's behind each implementation so that I can abstract it in my head and apply it to other examples and problems. But for example, how is,    int[] blah = new int(50);  Array.asList(blah)l    going to teach me about turning an array into a linear list or even a string? Yeah Java has the facilities, but it's all behind the fog (API).     One other issue I have is that the author spends way too much time testing the Java API (about two chapters). And further, even as the book progresses, he keeps calling Java's internal, built-in methods and interface.     It's not a bad book for the price, but don't buy it as a substitute for a text book or even a main aid book.	2005-01-15

Hi, <br /> <br />First, I'm a senior CS student and I have not seen a book this bad ever since romance novels were invented. Now, here is why: <br /> <br />* The code is confusing and obfuscated at best. <br />* The author is often vague about which of the plethora of examples he is talking about. <br />* The later chapters (the most important) are pretty damn close to being unintelligible. The author is all over the place and the examples are inadequate. As someone mentioned, he tends to give final answers or outputs rather than walking the student through the problem. <br /> <br />Overall, don't buy this book unless you MUST.

This book is unbelievably effective at getting the students prepared for what Computer Science it's all about. This semester I had the luck to get a great professor who has made clear that mathematics, vis a vis computers, it's not about \\"pushing symbols\\" or numbers. It's about understanding what a computer is in its innermost form. This book accomplishes that marvelously. As an undergraduate Computer Science student I find this book to be enlightening. It's one of the best, if not the best, book in the field. The coherence and candid and unassuming tone of the author makes the book much more approachable than most books in the subject. He, the author, understood that most CS people were getting \\"thrown off\\" by the lingo and the mathematical assumptions made by so many other authors in the field.<br /><br />As a refutal to one reviewer: The fact that this book does not have a solution manual is what makes it SO great! Guess what? In real life, in mathematics there is NO solutions manual! You have to find it by yourself. Most problems in mathematics go without solution for ages, until one person has the epiphany and solves it. Most mathematicians, in as hard as they work and as smart as they are, never discover new proofs or new theories. It's irresponsible to lambast this volume just because \\"it does not have a solution manual.\\"	2004-10-26

This book's attempt at explaining this seeming common thread in Mathematical Logic, Music and Art is a noble one. The author tries to explain, in my opinion, too many things at once. Even though the author is never incoherent, the vast task of explaining not only his thesis but also the history behind it, overwhelms the reader time and time again.   As a mathematics student and enthusiast, this book had a very profound impact in the way I think about mathematics. The fact that mathematics (being as complex as it is) cannot be proven by using mathematics is a very, if not the most, important concept this book attempts to uncover.  As far as the historical/biographical aspect of the book, I think it's very well done and very well contextualized.   The book about three of the most important geniuses in areas so diverse and seemingly disconnected, yet in the innermost layer they all are intertwined. Again, great book, great author, spell-bounding conclusions.  I, however, have couple of caveats (to the reader):  1) This book requires some knowledge in mathematical logic,  2) It is not an \\"easy read,\\" so be prepared to be mentally challenged.	2004-10-15

This book is by far one of the most artistic books Vonnegut has ever written. Both a very poignant critique of American society and a auto-biography. In fact, it's a book that not only lambasts American lifestyles it's also a critique of Humanity as a whole. It's a satire about human folly and futility. It's About flesh machinery and complacency. It's About superfluous endeavors and non-sense. I never though I would laugh at misery and calamity before in my life , yet as one reads this primer laughing at such things is all but inevitable. <BR>On the literary aspect of this book, it possesses the master penmanship one would expect from Vonnegut. It's post-modern meta-fiction at its best.

The great adventure of a WWII veteran seeking both a story to tell in his book and a rationale for all the people who died there. \\"So it goes.\\" Vonnegut takes us in the psyche of many a soldier who served in that fateful war. His characters are so human and realistic that it is not hard to get involved with the story. The author, since he found wars to be utterly and shamelessly stupid and pointless, found a rationale and consolation in an explanation given to one of the character in a planet millions of light-years away. Among other things, Vonnegut shows us how time travel is already possible and we all can achieve it by just thinking about it. <BR>This books is a great satire and quite funny at times. What forbids it from being funnier is the fact that the subject matter is indeed very serious and depressing. A must for modern meta-fiction readers.	2004-06-26

However, the explanations are overly simplistic and no real substance. Its examples are too concrete and don't leave room for more generalization (abstraction, if you will). Because of this, the book is rather limited and and too strict. I understand the intent of the authors was to teach newcomers by &quot;forcing&quot; them through examples, however, I found the cooking recipe-style to be much too constrictive and inflexible.<br />And I think leaves the person with more questions as to how to do things on their own, but it gives no clues as to how to do it.

The social commentary that is diguised in the form of satire is rather tremendous and poignant. It has definitely an anti-war flavor to it, but it never overshadows the real substance of the author's witticism. It's a funny book, but not \\"hillarious\\" as the back cover of this volume attests. From a different point of view, it's a rather sad book if you understand the implications of the subject matter. A very good book and would recommend to any one interested in modern and post-modern American prose.<br />Refutations:<br />* Vonnegut is a post-modernist, which implies that the book (or any work of art) can and more likely be free of classical rigidity. So, complaining that he jumps back and forth through time and places is not a good criterion to undermine this work.<br />* Repudiating this work because of Vonnegut's anti-war passages is as unfair as doing the same for say, Hemingway, O'Brian, Dalai Lama. <br />* This is a quinteseential post-moder work, and as said above, it should and does not need to conform to the cannonical rules of plot flow, time flow, and characater development. You could even call this book a Cubist work due to its subdivisions within chapters. <br />* This book goes much more than just war. It goes into love, sex, selling of American enterprises (and hence America) to foreign investors, race, class consciousness, and the attempt to keep the status quo by those who are ver well-off.<br />* This book is completely well structured. Your could easily read just one chapter and be as happy as reading the whole book. The chapters are self-sufficient and self-contained. The further chapters are elaborations of thing, characters and bits from preceding chapters.<br />* This is a GOOD book!	2004-01-01

Kundera should be revered as other genius authors are (e.g. Hemingway, Twain, et cetera).<BR>This book brought many a smile, reflection and tear in me. It evoked so many feelings and imagery.

He does not and never has writen about domestic policy (except for propaganda and education). His is scale is FAR larger than what many critics credit him for. His vision is truly global and not boxed-in. <BR>Additionally, it's precisely that ethnocentric attitude that has the U.S. in such a disfavored view around the world. The majority of people here see the U.S. as self-sufficient and could happily live forever in isolation. Could not be more wrong! We're SO intertwined with the rest of the world that is actually OUR duty to be fair and ethical. It's just as when people tell me &quot;the French are rude, because they don't speak English.&quot;<br />In this book Chomsky poses one VERY important question: Is human race headed for self-destruction? And I think that though seeming contradictory, the question is un-answerable. It's a great book and I find it actually a departure from classical Chomskian argumentation. The book has a more humanistic side to it than Chomsky's other volumes. Very good and important read. Highly recommend.	2003-11-26

Kurt Vonnegut is definitely a genius of American literature and a much under-rated at that. Very beautifully written from a person who could have easily turned bitter or tormented by blows life has dealt him. Excellent penmanship, excellent story.	2003-11-26

The book is a very extensive explanation of the social cost-benfits of globalization. Further, it shows why it has failed many times in the past. The two main culprits of the &quot;demise&quot; of globalization are (ironically enough) the two main organizations who are supposed to be in charge of development, poverty, welfare, and resciliency of the world's economy. It shows how technocrats and bureaucrats have dome much more damage than good in developing countries. Very good book, very important conclusions. We're in a very intertwined world, and now more than ever before we all need to be participatory in the ethical globalization movement.<br />Why not to give 5 stars?<br />*It did not contain the academic rigor I was expecting from such insightful economist.<br />*Some parts of certain chapters the conversation gets repetitious.	2003-10-26

However, I won't keep my arms crossed and watch silly right-wingers give this piece of manure of a book 5 stars. Just as liberals give 1 star to it. Neither rating is deserved. The book as any from O'Reilly is mediocre at best. The Irony of it all is that he claims to know everything there is to know. He, the person who used to work for a TV tabloid show, claims to have insights into the innermost mechanics of our world. Ludicrous! <BR>Bill makes himself look great on TV by inviting weak guests and by bullying those who DO know a thing or two. <BR>Giving this book 5 stars is as ridiculous as giving it 1. People should stop rating a book based ad homiens.<BR>If you like O'Reilly (and his arrogant stupidity) go ahead and buy this boook, if you don't like O'Reilly go ahead and speak your mind, but DO NOT write a review if you have not read this book in its entirety.	2003-10-21

Laura, makes sense and it's not just Coulter-style vile ranting. She has some points of import. However, I disagree to some of them. People around here should stop giving good or bad reviews to books based on the person who wrote the book. Yes, I understand we're in a very politically-charged, politically-divided time in our country, but what's the point of giving a 1 star rating for a nice book (or giving 5 stars for a mediocre book) just because you like/dislike the person who wrote it and the opinions given? It still baffles me the level of inmaturity of some. <BR>Back to the book, If you have ever listened to Laura on the radio you know she holds no prisoners and her arguments are based on documented facts (unlike Coulter). Good Book, but I wish she would have spent more time in the substance of politics rather than those Holywood know-nothing.	2003-10-21

Bush's America	Books	5	30	33	N	Y	Very Sad, but Very True	Disclaimer: I'm not a Democratic or Republican supporter.<BR>In spite of what right-wingers might say, this is not &quot;a leftist conspiracy.&quot; And I should emphasize the no-conspiracy part, because this is a book of facts! Example after example, the authors give a DOCUMENTED account of the disgraces &quot;W&quot; did in TX, and how it is now reflecting in the netire U.S. policy, and even more alarming, we're using BAD Texas-style foreign policy too.<BR>It's a very nicely-written book, and the sarcastic tone of the authors makes this book all the more enticing.	2003-09-30

But I just thought that the right-leaning media was getting away with it. <BR>Through a plethora of DOCUMENTED exposs Al Franken (an unrepentant left-winger) shows readers exactly what the right media is doing, and why they're getting away with it.<BR>To begin with, you cannot overlook Franken's funny, sardonic, witty writing style. However, he knows when to be serious so as not to undermine his research work.<BR>On to the substance! He first starts by debunking Ann Coulter, who I always thought was a very sneaky, half-wit, over-hyped liar. He shows how she hides information from the readers. How she takes quotes completely out of context and how she mis-construdes statements. Even some of her sources are utterly baffled at the mis-representation of the facts.<BR>Then to O'Reily whom I've always thought was a moron with a tele prompter. He's so flagrant in his right-wing agenda, and so arrogant about his &quot;fair and balanced&quot; views, that he's actually a pretty easy target. Now, onto an even easier target. Sean Hannity. This guy, you've got to give him credit. I don't how he made it into main-stream TV. If you think O'Reily is arrogant, well this guy is much more so, but with nothing to brag about. He's right-out DUMB! Yet he claims to have a much deeper understanding of the underlying ethereal ways our world works--Give me a break! He would not know how much is 1+1 even if he tried.<BR>And Franken goes on with a multitude of very revealing, and starking facts about the so-called &quot;fair and balanced.&quot; <BR>As an independent-minded and skeptical person, I can tell you that this book is one of Franken's better ones. Yes he gives his left-leaning views, yet you could read the book, skim off the political ideology statements and still be a good book.<BR>I highly recommend it... For what it's worth!	2003-09-22

Her arguments are filled with rage and obsessive-compulsive anti-liberalism. I'm myself neither liberal nor conservative. As such I can't see what her argument really is. If she's a republican, sure, so be it. But to put out a book which I would argue is as &quot;slander&quot;ous  as she claims the left-leaning media is is nonsense. <BR>Sure she is half-way smart, and sure she makes some valid points. However, her over-zealous style, her irrational conversationalism, and some of her facts are dead wrong!<BR>Even if I were a conservative I would not read this book. Unless of course you're so full of yourself that you need to buy the book so that it can &quot;agree&quot; with your views.	2003-09-07

He has to be one of the most under-rated playwrights out there. Me and my wife enjoy every single one of his plays. His story-telling through characters is superb, and every little detail in his plays are there with a purpose. Further, every play he has written is with a purpose! His anthropological knowledge of our culture is stunning. I cannot emphasize this enough: all of his plays have a deeper purpose!<BR>Blessing!	2003-07-04

Further, she is the kind of author that makes the reader feel to go out there and find out more in his/her own about esoteric and etheral methematical concepts. I myself have traded for a number of years as was always very skeptical of Tech Analysis. After reading this book, though I'm still skeptical, I am a little more open to use TA in my trades.<br />I think Constance, the author, has grown up since she wrote &quot;Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional.&quot; This time around she is less &quot;naggy,&quot; without ever being dry and stoic.<br />Many people who do not like her is because they disregard her for being too &quot;womanish&quot; in her literay voice. Of course, the aforemntioned point of view is very chauvinistic, and should ne be the basis for judging her works.<br />The only problem I found was that the last three or four chapters were botched. I'm myself an engineer by training and a mathematician by hobby and I can tell she was getting into math that was way over her head and over the head of many of her readers.<br />The book is a definite must if you're interested in Tech Analysis. It will introduce you, teach you with intricate detail, let you teach yourself, and finally see the conclusions of your work.<br />I really like the very last chapter &quot;the 27 million dollar lunch&quot; I think this chapter alone will teach more about TA/Investing that any primer out there.<br />As I said in the subject, this is a very good, solid book.	2003-07-04

It's well redacted, the ideas are well put by the author, and it's easily accesible for those who don't have a science/environment/economics background. All the ideas and conclusions are superbly supported, and the book leads the reader to unavoidable conclusions about what to do with our environment. This book's is so relvant to today's economy/ecology, then the author goes further and puts forth a workable framework to both, save the economy and humnaity. Very good book indeed.	2003-04-20

His ideas are SO far fetched it almost looks as though it is a sci-fi book. Whoever gave it 5 stars must not know how capitalism really works, and how gov't works. It was so off base that I don't even know where to begin. As soon as you read the into and the first chapter you'll notice that the author's propositions are whimsical at best. One thing is caring about our environment (I do), but to create this NGO (Non-Gov't org) to collect environemntal taxation is one of the most nonsensical ideas I've ever heard! Just do yourself a favor and don't buy this book, that is, unless you really want to make the author rich and make yourself miserable.	2003-04-01

This is one of the best physics/philosophy books I've read. The reader can sense Heisenberg's feelings and thoughts throughout the book, about the development of new &quot;revolutionary&quot; theories in around the world. The book is a reflection/critique on human advancement, and the ultimate understanding of the innermost layer of nature and what this &quot;really&quot; means for humanity.

Another bad thing about  this book is that it is not professional at all; the author is a Ph.D in  psicology and he gives no account of that.

If you have read any of  Fayman's book, you know his ways of explaining things are just superb.
