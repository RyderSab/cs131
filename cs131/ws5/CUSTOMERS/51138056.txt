It is a bitter and ridiculous irony that might have been lifted from one of his own plays.  It is also a great pity, for Orton was a comic genius whose plays equal the best of English with from Congreve to Wilde to Coward.  And if you like your comedy with an ample edge of mean-spiritedness, brutality, cruelty, and flat-out viciousness, Orton is the man for you.<br /><br />THE COMPLETE PLAYS is not as complete as the title implies, for the text leaves out several titles that never received any production during Orton's lifetime.  Still, it does collect the major titles, and that in itself is enough to earn it a place on any serious play-reader's shelf.<br /><br />Originally presented as a BBC radio program, THE RUFFIAN ON THE STAIR presents the story of Joyce, an unmarried woman of dubious background who is now under the control of Mike, an older man who has mysterious assignations that lead to a fateful encounter with a boy hairdresser named Wilson--whose lover (or brother, depending on how you think about it) may have been a victim of one of Mike's covert operations.  It got Orton noticed, and his next effort would truly put him on the map: ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE was and is one of the salaciously funny comedies ever brought to the stage, the wickedly funny tale of an aging sex-crazed woman and her homosexual brother who use their father's murder as a means of blackmailing a young thug into their respective beds.<br /><br />THE GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT, THE ERPINGHAM CAMP, and FUNERAL GAMES have much to offer but are actually minor titles in comparison with the two plays that critics consider great masterpieces: LOOT, a bitterly savage farce concerning a robbery, a death in the family, and the uses to which you can put Mother's coffin (not to mention false teeth) in a pinch; and WHAT THE BUTLER SAW, set in a psychiatrist's office in which everyone has truly gone round the bend.<br /><br />Orton was a master of language that forces you to laugh even as it cuts you like a straight-edged razor across the throat; you can't help but laugh even as you collapse bleeding to the floor.  Even so, it is worth pointing out that plays are really written to be performed rather than read, and this particularly true of Orton; unless you have a very strong background in theatre you may do better to wait for your local rep company to take up the challenge.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewern (not to mention false teeth) in a pinch; and WHAT THE BUTLER SAW, set in a psychiatrist's office in which everyone has truly gone round the bend.<br /><br />Orton was a master of language that forces you to laugh even as it cuts you like a straight-edged razor across the throat; you can't help but laugh even as you collapse bleeding to the floor.

Frankly autobiographical in nature (the narrator is here given as Christopher Isherwood himself), the collection at first seems little more than a series of character portraits and random events--but as the work progresses it gathers into a dark, often disturbing portrait of Berlin as Germany drifts into the control of the Nazi party, a riot of personalities and swirl of events laced with references to national anti-Semitism and cultural xenophobia, all of it combining to invite the horrors that will cumulate in the cataclysm of World War II.<br /><br />This is the heart of the book and easily it's greatest part, but it is accompanied by THE LAST OF MR. NORRIS, originally published as a separate work in 1935 as MR. NORRIS CHANGES TRAINS, a work that opens THE BERLIN STORIES.  Substantial in and of itself, the short novel presents the relationship between the narrator (here given as Bradshaw) and an elderly and not quite likeable Mr. Norris--a man seemingly engaged in the import-export business but whose covert dealings will ultimate move him to betray even his closest friends.  In terms of character and events the novel pales beside GOODBYE TO BERLIN, but in tone and scope it heightens the sense of a society in which anything, no matter how improbable, can happen, and it is very fine indeed.<br /><br />Readers who come to THE BERLIN STORIES with the idea that they will encounter the plot of CABARET are in for a rude awakening; although the characters are similar, the stories involved are not.  In the 1950s Isherwood authorized John Van Druten to dramatize GOODBYE TO BERLIN for the stage, and the result was a critically and commercially popular play titled I AM A CAMERA.  Isherwood approved of the final result--but he was considerably less fond of CABARET, which presented a love affair between Isherwood and Sally Bowles as the backbone story.  Isherwood, unapologetically homosexual, was outraged, telling friends that he had never had any romantic or sexual relationship with that or any other woman.  Consequently, it is best to regard CABARET as a grandchild of THE BERLIN STORIES and to read Isherwood's work for its own merits rather than this connection.<br /><br />And those merits are many.  Throughout the entire collection, Isherwood shows a talent for creating characters that leap from the page, with the legendary Sally Bowles a case in point; his prose is also quite remarkable, an unexpected mix of the flatly direct and perceptively poetic.  He writes in a style quite unlike any other author I have encountered.  Many consider THE BERLIN STORIES his finest work; in any case, Isherwood's style and perspective makes it a commanding, fascinating read.

Mead's compilation has been around in one form or another since it was first published in 1965--and justly so, for it gathers quotes on 200 subjects from more than 2,500 sources.<br /><br />The quotations are arranged by alphabetical topic, beginning with \\"Adversity\\" and continuing through \\"Zeal.\\"  The individual quotes appear under each topic alphabetically according the author's name.  The text concludes with two indexes: Authors, which notes the author's name and the pages on which quotations appear, and topic, which notes the pages on which the topic is listed.<br /><br />In truth, a collection of quotations on any subject seems a bit spurious in this age of computers and internet search engines, but Mead's collection is worthy due to the unexpected variety of individuals and topics it covers.  The collection is not limited to any one religion nor to any one denomination within a single relgion; you will find quotes from believes, unbelievers, and a broad array of unlikely sources.  To open a page at random is to find yourself confronted with Martin Luther, Voltaire, and Madame Chiang Kai-sheck--or perhaps Swinburne, Lord Tennyson, or Seneca.<br /><br />True enough, the volume does have its uses for those who are not computer or internet literate; to my mind, however, it is most enjoyable as a \\"glance at\\" volume--reading from such a very wide and unlikely mixture is inevitably provocative, entertaining, and often enlightening in unexpected ways.  Recommend less for reference than for the sheer enjoyment of it!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-07-29

The larger portion of the text, however, lists each scripture in sequence of text and recommends hymns appropriate to each scripture.<br /><br />The Scripture Index includes Old Testament, New Testament, and Apocrypha.  In each instance the scripture is indicated in sequence and the text recommends several hymns that the worship planner may find useful.  As an example, INDEXES recommends such hymns as \\"God Will Take Care of You\\" and \\"Forward Through the Ages\\" in conjunction with 2nd Samuel 5:1-3, 7:1-17.  Each reading in the lectionary is included and several hymns are recommended for each passage.<br /><br />The Seasonal Index, which is particularly useful, lists approximately 100 holy days, secular holidays, and specific events ranging from Advent and Aldersgate Day to World Day of Prayer and Youth Sunday.  In each instance a selection of hymns are recommended and in some cases Psalm readings are also suggested.<br /><br />Both the Scripture Index and the Seasonal Index list recommended hymns in the order they appear in the United Methodist Hymnal, giving page numbers for all hymns noted.  While even the most experienced United Methodist minister or Music Director will likely find it useful on occasion, it is an essential for those who must occasionally plan a worship service without ministerial guidance.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-07-28

Best known for his detective Dr. Gideon Fell, Carr also wrote a host of novels featuring other characters, most notably the French detective M. Bencolin.  The 1932 POISON IN JEST features neither Fell nor Bencolin, but it does focus upon Bencolin sidekick Jeff Marle--who has been summoned to a mysterious house in Pennsylvania just in time for three poisonings and a hatchet murder.<br /><br />The plot focuses on Judge Quayle, an elderly man surrounded by a large and largely unsympathetic family.  Quayle is remarkably eccentric, going through life in fear of a ghostly, disembodied hand that plauges his every moment; he is also the target of a poisoner that deals a double-blow, first attacking Mrs. Quayle with arsenic and then Quayle himself with hyoscin.<br /><br />Marle soon finds himself working with Judge Quayle's son-in-law Dr. Twills to unmask the poisoner--but Twills himself is soon under poisonous attack.  Fortunately for all concerned, oddly behaved yet astute Patrick Rossiter is soon on the scene, and with a little assist from Marle and encouragement from Jinny Quayle the strange assortment of murders and attempted murders is soon untangled.<br /><br />But not, I must say, convincingly so.  At his best Carr was a truly gifted writer, taking readers by surprise with his notably twisty plots--and while POISON IN JEST certainly has its share of twists and turns, they are all so utterly implausible as to explode the reader's suspension of disbelief.  At the same time, the atmosphere for which Carr was equally noted is laid on with a trowel and his characters prove so cardboardish that I found it difficult to tell one from another.  This is not among Carr's better novels, and I do not recommend it for any one except the most determined among the author's fans.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-07-24

Even so, as Christie entered her sunset years, the nature of her novels changed, often becoming less interesting for the complex plots that made her reputation than for their chatty charm.<br /><br />This is very much the case with the 1971 Miss Marple mystery NEMESIS, which falters in both style and plot when compared against the truly great Christie novels of 1930-1960.  Although densely written, the narrative is unexpectedly repetitive in nature; for once it is actually possible to skim passages of a Christie novel without missing telling detail.  While the plot is not transparent, it seems slightly out of focus and it lacks the unexpected edges that made Christie world famous in the genre.  Even so, NEMESIS remains an entertaining read largely via the charm of Christie's favorite reoccurring character, English spinster Jane Marple, presented here in all her disconcerting glory.<br /><br />As a novel, NEMESIS grows out the 1964 A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY, a work that found Miss Marple joining forces with wealthy invalid Mr. Rafiel to thwart a murderer in a south seas resort.  For Mr. Rafiel has died and has remembered Miss Marple in his will--albeit in a most peculiar way.  He asks that she undertake an investigation for him, but he does not specify the nature of the task.  Miss Marple is at a loose end.  How does one investigate a matter without names, places, dates, without information or detail of any kind?<br /><br />Fortunately, the resourceful Mr. Rafiel has provided a way. When Miss Marple embarks upon her journey she soon finds herself ensnared in a Gordian knot of tragedy, love, perversity, evil, and murder that lurks under a veneer of the often beautiful and seeming innocent English countryside.  Christie was seldom noted for her talent for atmosphere, but this indeed the great strength of NEMESIS; it is very much like biting into a rosy apple only to discover rot at the core.<br /><br />NEMESIS is unlikely to please hardcore fans in search of one of Christie's legendarily mind-bending plots, but fans will enjoy the unexpected premise, and Miss Marple remains everyone's favorite English spinster with a nose for evil.

Even so, as Christie entered her sunset years, the nature of her novels changed, often becoming less interesting for the complex plots that made her reputation than for a their chatty charm.<br /><br />Such is the case with 1964 A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY, which finds Christie revisiting her favorite character Jane Marple--but in a unlikely setting.  Suffering from arthritis, Miss Marple has been sent on vacation to a south seas resort by her nephew Raymond.  The weather is lovely, the sea is lovely, and Miss Marple finds her incredibly bored... until the unexpected death of retired Major Palgrave forces her to wonder if there is, as the Major seemed to suspect, a killer in this island paradise.<br /><br />The plot is entertaining but, for Christie, surprisingly transparent; most readers will spot the killer approximately two thirds of the way into the book.  The great charm of the book is in its characters and the deftly amusing way in which Christie presents them.  A visit with Miss Marple is always enjoyable, and she remains every one's favorite English spinster--and Christie presents several other characters, including the very wealthy and very gruff Mr. Raifiel and his ever-calm secretary Esther, both of whom will figure in the 1971 NEMESIS.<br /><br />Hardcore mystery readers in search of one of Christie's truly mind-bender tales may be disappointed with A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY, but most Christie readers will find it unexpectedly light but none the less enjoyable for that.

But how does one go from being Henry Fonda's daughter, seemingly born to success, to Hanoi Jane, seemingly determined to throw away not only self but country as well?  How does Jane Fonda become Jane Fonda?<br /><br />The answer is somewhat startling.  At core, MY LIFE SO FAR is the story of the relationship between a cold and distant father and a highly insecure daughter who repeatedly sought to validate herself by winning her father's approval.  That drive would become so strong that it would influence, color, and at times completely warp every aspect of Fonda's early life--and then in a perversely logical manner it would reverse, becoming a drive to reject not only everything her father was but everything he, as an icon of \\"the American way\\" on film, seemed to stand for.  Unfortunately for Fonda, fame came with the package, and instead of simply being one more in the wave of 1960s-1970s counterculture youth she became the poster child for an entire generation that no longer trusted established authority.  The end result would be an image that flashed around the world: Hanoi Jane, seated on a Viet-Cong anti-aircraft gun, smiling for the camera.<br /><br />There was no possible excuse and Fonda wisely offers none.  Instead, she presents a clear and at times compelling description of how she gradually became involved in the growing anti-war movement, what she hoped to accomplish, and why she thought particular activities--including her notorious visit to Vietnam--would achieve those goals.  At the same time, her hindsight allows her to present a portrait of how she occasionally failed, sometimes through ignorance, sometimes through innocence, and most often through her own insecurities.  To her credit, she does not attempt to justify her mistakes, but rather attempts to explain how she came to make them, and while she shows regret for particular mistakes she does not apologize for the motives that gave rise to them.  It is a fine line, and one that is unlikely to placate detractors; even so, it has a degree of personal integrity that caught me entirely off guard.  She is also remarkably forthcoming about the impact her activism had on herself personally, often quoting from the expansive FBI investigation her behavior prompted.<br /><br />It was during this period that father Henry tended to deny he had a daughter at all, and the relationship might well have ended at that--but it did not, and the two would continue to collide over the years as Fonda repeatedly attempted to find a satisfying balance to their relationship.  What ultimately emerges is not so much a portrait of an unloving father and a needy daughter as that of a father and daughter who did not know how to give or receive from each other in any emotional sense.  In the end, art would imitate life, with father and daughter playing out aspects of their real-life relationship in the Academy Award winning film ON GOLDEN POND--and in spite of their decades of difficulty Fonda makes it clear that she believes the two reached mutual acceptance toward the end of her father's life.<br /><br />Although Fonda's relationship with her father and her political and social activism tend to dominate the book, she is indeed a film star, and a goodly portion of her writings describe her work--although, perhaps typically, she does not always focus on the various films and co-stars you might expect.  (BARBARELLA gets considerably more attention than some of her more lauded movies.)  Still, she can name-drop with the best of them, and her occasional portraits of co-workers are insightful and her description of the legendary Katherine Hepburn particularly so.  Fonda is also remarkably forthcoming about her three marriages and subsequent divorces, and her various subjects are as far-flung in scope as the scope of her far-flung life itself.  From bulimic to fitness guru, from insecure model to two-time Oscar winner, from New York to Hanoi, no one can complain that the book lacks for content.<br /><br />Fonda is no great literary stylist, but she writes with an unexpected directness often tempered by a dry sense of humor, and the result is at once extremely readable and extremely sincere, if at times a shade pretentious when she stakes out various positions on social and political issues.  You may not believe in the various causes she has taken up over the years.  More to the point, you may not agree with her reasoning on the various issues in which she has involved herself.  But you never doubt that she herself believes what she says is true, and when she takes a position she pulls no punches in her opinions; she is brutally honest--and not always in her own favor.  You may love her, you may hate her--but from either side of the coin she is an interesting woman who has led a very unexpected life--and who now puts everything on full display.

She also had a knack for writing tongue-in-cheek, exhibiting a sly sense of humor for those sharp enough to catch it.  The 1942 THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY is an excellent example of both.<br /><br />The title is a classic cliche, immediately bringing to mind an old fashioned whodunit of the Mary Roberts Rinehart type, the sort of novel in which an improbable victim is discovered in an impossible setting.  But Christie twists the cliche, playing upon the idea in an darkly comic sort of way.  After all, what would you do if you awoke one morning to find a bleached blonde strangled to death and tossed on the library floor before the fireplace?<br /><br />As it happens--and most fortunately--Col. and Mrs. Bantry know an expert in all things homocidal: everyone's favorite spinster lady, Miss Marple.  When the victim is traced to a nearby resort, Mrs. Bantry wastes little time in booking rooms for both Miss Marple and herself and the hunt is on, complete with a series of unbreakable alibis, hidden motives, and a classic Christie plot twist at the end.<br /><br />THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY does not really compete with Christie's absolute best--but then few titles, regardless of author, do.  But it is among her most witty works, a fast-paced read that can be swallowed whole in a single sitting.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-07-17

And although most of her work could be best described as \\"romance,\\" it is for her occasional mystery that she is best recalled today.<br /><br />Written in 1907 and published in 1908, THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE was among Rinehart's most popular works.  Wealthy spinster Miss Innes is persuaded by her two wards--niece and nephew Gertrude and Halsey--to take a house in the country for the summer.  But no sooner is Miss Innes and her fearful maid Liddy installed at Sunnyside then things begin to go bump in night, and murder is not far behind.<br /><br />THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE is very much of its era: like many novels of the time it has a Victorian hang-over that shows in both its highly improbable plot and its determination to spell out every possible detail.  Not a great stylist, Rinehart was never really able to shed these issues in any of her works--but if you are prepared to suspend disbelief and enter into the spirit of the thing THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE is actually quite a bit of fun.  There are sounds in the night, mysterious faces at the window, screaming maids, unexpected visitors, and all the rest.  And the book would become extremely influential in an unexpected way.<br /><br />In 1917 Rinehart joined forces with playwright Avery Hopwood to adapt THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE to the stage, and when it opened on Broadway in 1920 as THE BAT it proved one of the decade's most durable shows, a mixture of mystery and comic cliche.  The result was a wave of similar novels, plays, and films that not only cast a long shadow but which are still very much with us today.  So wait until a dark and stormy night, pour yourself a cup of warm milk, and read THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE by flickering candlelight... and if you hear a noise in the furthermost part of the house, just tell yourself it's only Miss Innes making one of her ill-advised nocturnal investigations!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewera noise in the furthermost part of the house, just tell yourself it's only Miss Innes making one of her ill-advised nocturnal investigations! <br /> <br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-07-17

Fortunately, he turned to writing and discovered his true calling: the 1971 novel THE OTHER was a critical and popular sensation, easily one of the best psychological horror novels of the decade.  He followed it in 1973 with equally lauded and popular HARVEST HOME.<br /><br />Read today, it easy to foresee several of the major plots of HARVEST HOME--but this is largely because so many later novelists (including Stephen King) borrowed so liberally from the novel.  Still, there's nothing like the original, and in 1973 the book was all of that, the tale of a New York couple with a difficult teenager daughter who decide to trade the crime-ridden cityscape for countryside peace... and stumble into a rural nightmare that makes a metropolitan crime wave seem tame by comparison.<br /><br />Cornwall Coombe is a tiny, isolated village, the sort of place where everyone is related to everyone else by blood or marriage or sometimes both.  It is also a community that clings to \\"the old ways,\\" rejecting most modern agricultural ideas--not to mention newcomers to the area.  As it happens, however, Ned and Beth Constantine and their daughter are smiled upon by the Widow Fortune, a woman who holds tremendous sway in the community, and as time passes they are accepted.<br /><br />But into what?  For it soon transpires that the \\"old ways\\" include a number of odd superstitions, all of them centering on the cycle of seasons and the area's corn crop.  At first Ned is amused, then curious--but the more he learns the more disturbing the superstitions and traditions become.  And unsavory stories abound: the strange grave of Gracie Everdean, the mystery of Missy Penrose's parentage, the ghost of \\"Soake's Lonesome\\"--and always, always the corn crop itself.<br /><br />The novel can be criticized for the occasional plot or character inconsistency, and as previously noted the basic premise has been so often repeated that much of the plot can be foreseen.  Even so, it is a tremendously readable novel, atmospheric and truly disturbing, and while it does not best Tryon's THE OTHER (which remains his masterpiece), HARVEST HOME is uniquely memorable in its own right.<br /><br />Sadly, Tryon would die in 1991, having written only a handful of novels; amazingly, most of his works--including THE OTHER and HARVEST HOME--are out of print.  But like THE OTHER, HARVEST HOME is well worth seeking out.

Each lesson closes with a final point, a story or poem that illustrates the author's point of view, and suggestions for further reading.<br /><br />As an author, however, Herr leaves something to be desired.  Her \\"introductions\\" are essentially fictionalized portraits of the various women that read rather like popular romance novels; her closing points, stories, and poems range from the obvious to the saccharine.  Most particularly, however, Herr takes the point of view that a woman's place should be in subservence to a man.<br /><br />At times this attitude is highly obvious, as in the lessons on Eve and Jezebel, the latter of which is offered as an example of a woman whose domination of her husband leads to some very unsavory results.  More often, however, it is implicit in the way that Herr presents the lessons in a general sense, with lessons concerning Ruth and Mary Magdalene cases in point.  I took issue this overall tone, as well as with several other ideas Herr broaches, with the status of Rahab a good example; although Herr notes that some scholars do not believe that Rahab was a \\"harlot\\" in the present sense of the word, she offers nothing in the way of in-text documentation on the issue.<br /><br />CHOSEN WOMEN does not specifically align itself with any one Christian denomination, but in the final analysis it reads very much like an extended Southern Baptist tract softened via the language of a purple-prose bestseller.  As such, I find it hard to believe that it will appeal greatly to either fundamentalists, who will object to the author's habit of fictionalization, or liberal demonimations, who will disagree with the author's stance on gender roles.  I cannot imagine to whom it is supposed to appeal.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerHOSEN WOMEN does not specifically align itself with any one Christian denomination, but in the final analysis it reads very much like an extended Southern Baptist tract softened via the language of a purple-prose bestseller.

Published in 1951, FALLEN INTO THE PIT is first novel in that series--and easily the best.<br /><br />Most of the Inspector Felse novels run approximately two hundred pages; FALLEN INTO THE PIT runs over three hundred.  To a certain extent this is due to Peters' establishment of the main characters and locales--but in simple fact the novel is much more densely written than her other Felse novels, so much so that at times it has an almost poetic quality.<br /><br />Set in England following World War II, the plot focuses on a young German prisoner of war named Helmut Schauffler, who has remained in England after his release.  Unfortunately, Helmut is a nasty bit of goods: a bully who attacks only when reasonably certain that there will be no retribution.  Needless to say, he makes enemies right and left--and no one is greatly surprized when he is found with his head crushed in and thrown into a country stream.<br /><br />Peters' plots are typically contrived, and although handsomely written and more than usually entertaining this is no less true of FALLEN INTO THE PIT than it is of her other works; long-time mystery readers will likely spot the killer through the way the author draws out her plot and sets forth the characters.  Even so, this remains a particularly fine title in the Felse series.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-07-09

Published in 1970, THE KNOCKER ON DEATH'S DOOR is the tenth novel in that series--and among the best.<br /><br />Peters often worked with contrived-but-witty plots, and this work shows her at her best.  The Macsen-Martels have a notable family tree and historic home, but their time has passed.  In the face of dwindling fortunes, they have decided to pass their home into the hands of the National Trust--but before they do so they restore to the local cathedral a historic door that fell into their possession.  But along with the door goes a legend, the tale of a man who was carried off by the devil when the door refused to admit him into the church.<br /><br />Needless to say, no sooner is the door returned to its rightful place at the church than there is a body to go with it: a news photographer is found dead at the threshold, his hand extended to the great cast iron knocker.  But his soul wasn't spirited away by the devil, at least not judging from the gaping wound on the back of his head.  It is murder, and Inspector Felse is on the scene.<br /><br />Unlike most Felse novels, this particular entry does not feature his son Dominic; it instead offers an array of locals, some of whom are determined to play detective.  Although hardcore mystery fans will likely spot the killer early on simply due to the way Peters sets up the plot, the characters are well drawn and the story is an amiable companion for the hour or two it requires.

Emboldened by the dreams of a long-lived, much respected, and recently deceased pig named Major, the farm animals rebel, throw Mr. Jones out, and seize the property.  The will run the farm to suit themselves, and none will go hungry, none will be mistreated, and all animals will live equally as brothers.<br /><br />It is a fine dream--indeed, it mirrors mankind's most cherished hopes for civilization.  But history teaches us that where the opportunity for explotation exists there is no shortage of those to take advantage of it.  Little by little the clever pigs, led by Napoleon, rise to power.  And the other animals are too trusting and often too ignorant to see that they have merely exchanged one task master for another.<br /><br />ANIMAL FARM is often described as a satire on communist Russia.  That is certainly true, and readers who have some knowledge of the history of the Russian Soviet will be quick to recognize the parodies of Karl Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky, among others.  But Orwell cuts considerably deeper than this.  Russia may have been the starting point, but in truth the parable of ANIMAL FARM can be applied to any culture where political leaders manipulate the public through a mixture of unreasonable hope, media \\"spin,\\" and irrational fear to remain in power.<br /><br />As such, ANIMAL FARM remains as disquieting today as it was more than half a century ago.  And we can be sure that, in nations where power becomes centered in the hands of the few, it will continue to be among the first novels banned when that power becomes absolute.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-06-28

Published in 1978, RAINBOW'S END is the last novel in that series.<br /><br />Peters typically works with contrived plots, and this novel is in some ways typical; RAINBOW repeatedly asks the reader to accept the implausible as plausible.  Even so, Peters has a knack for making such plots entertaining, and this brightly written story of an unlikeable antiques dealer who plunges from a church tower is lightly written and quite entertaining.<br /><br />Felse makes his final appearance having been promoted to head of the Midshire C.I.D. and there are numerous brightly-written characters, most notably Barbara Rainbow and Willie-the-Twig, to round out the novel.

To his dismay, Annet is not interested; to his shock, she suddenly disappears on a hill of ancient ill-repute named Hallowmount.  And to every one's surprise, when she returns five days later, she claims to have been gone only a few hours.  Is it witchcraft?  Or has Annet fallen back on local legends in an effort to conceal her activities?  Fortunately, Inspector Felse is on the scene to separate fact from fiction.<br /><br />Peters often worked with contrived plots, and in her hands they are often quite amusing.  The plot of FLIGHT OF A WITCH is in someways typical of her work--but those expecting a mystery will be disappointed, for the novel is less mysterious than merely so much pulp romance, and while there is a murder to be solved it is less a matter of detection than in forcing the truth from the mysterious central character.  Although it has its moments, this is very much one of Peters' lesser works.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-06-26

Published in 1966, THE PIPER ON THE MOUNTAIN is the fifth novel in that series.<br /><br />Peters often worked with contrived plots, and that tendency is particularly obvious in this tale.  Government security agent Herbert Terrell, who is fond of mountain climbing, falls to his death while on vacation in Czechoslovakia's Tatras Mountains--but the nature of the accident seems a bit odd to Robert Welland, assigned to the British embassy at Prague, and he suspects foul play.  When Welland accidentally communicates his suspicions to Terrell's stepdaughter Tossa Barber, Tossa turns a student vacation to Europe into a search for the truth, and since Inspector Felse's son Dominic is in her party can Inspector Felse be far behind?<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the novel offers too little in the way of plot to sustain itself over the course of its two hundred pages--and although it offers an occasionally interesting look at Cold War era Czechoslovakia this is not really enough to hold a consistent interest.  Even so it is smoothly written in the Ellis Peters style, and while I would not recommend it to newcomers to the series, established fans will likely enjoy it.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-06-24

Published in 1967, BLACK IS THE COLOR OF MY TRUE LOVE'S HEART is the sixth novel in that series.  Like most of Peters' work, it is a lightly written, enjoyable read. <br /> <br />In this novel, Inspector Felse's son Dominic and his girlfriend Tossa are attending a weekend course on folk music at Follymead--but not all the interest involved is of a musical variety.  Singing star Lucien Galt draws all eyes; ballad singer Liri Palmer makes it plain from the stage that she loathes him; and television host Dickie Meurice seems determined to fan the flames for the sake of his own ego.  It is all in a day's work in the music business... until two men disappear from the college under very mysterious circumstances and Inspector Felse is called in to determine if foul play is afoot. <br /> <br />Peters will never compare to the great masters of the mystery genre, but she can be quite a lot of fun in her own right, and MY TRUE LOVE'S HEART is among the best of her Felse novels.

Published in 1961, DEATH AND THE JOYFUL WOMAN is the second novel in that series.  Like most of Peters' work, it is a lightly written, enjoyable read.<br /><br />In this particular novel, Inspector Felse is called to the scene of an unlikely homicide: Alfred Armiger, wealthy businessman and owner of the newly opened pub The Jolly Barmaid, has been found clubbed to death with a bottle of champagne.  At a guess, the most likely suspect would seem to be Armiger's son Leslie; the two have had a very public falling out.  But Leslie Armiger is hardly the only suspect; there is also the young and slightly eccentric heiress Kitty Norton, whose beauty ensnares Felse's young son Dominic.  And Dominic may be willing to run any risk to protect her from prison.<br /><br />JOYFUL WOMAN is among the most critically lauded of Peters' Inspector Felse novels, and with some reason.  The characters are particularly well drawn, the plot is quite tight, and it reads at a quick pace.  True enough, Peters will never compete with such masters of the genre as Christie, Sayers, or Marsh--and a sharp reader will likely spot the killer in the last third of the novel.

The child is raised by Martians and absorbs Martian civilization, teachings, and training as if he were of the race.  When a later expedition discovers Smith, he is \\"rescued\\" and returned to earth--and promptly begins a series of adventures that would put Voltaire's CANDIDE to shame.<br /><br />Given the novel's premise many have described it as science fiction, but it is really nothing of the kind; futuristic concepts play only minor roles in the construct and imaginings based on science are more minor still.  In fact, STRANGER IN A STRANGER LAND is essentially a satire, and like CANDIDE it focuses upon avarice, power, ignorance, and hypocrisy--and religious hypocrisy in particular.<br /><br />In short order Smith is kidnapped by the government that claims to have \\"saved\\" him--and becomes a pawn in a series of political power plays designed to strip him of both his legal rights and his inherited wealth for the benefit of the status quo.  No sooner does Smith escape this ordeal than he finds himself plunged into organized religion of the most vulgar description imaginable, complete with slot machines in the narthex, bar service in the sanctuary, and a stripper in every corner.<br /><br />Unable to comprehend the motives of man, Smith goes underground in an effort to more fully understand the race--and after an unexpected turn emerges as a quasi-religious figure himself, preaching a philosophy that merges Martian and Earthly thought.  But Smith proves all too human and is no more immune to human vices than those whose vices he seeks to correct, and the twin demons of government authority and religious fanaticism soon rise up to meet him.<br /><br />Changing mores have left STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND with a slightly dated feel, and in some respects it reads as slightly sexist and faintly homophobic.  Even so, the unfolding plot, the memorable characters, and Heinlein's bold style command attention; it is a page-turner if ever there was one.  And the novel's razor-like derision of man's social inventions remains as bitterly comic--and as bitterly compelling--as ever.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerChanging mores have left STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND with a slightly dated feel, and in some respects it reads as slightly sexist and faintly homophobic.

Published in 1965, A NICE DERANGEMENT OF EPITAPHS is the fourth novel in that series.  Like most of Peters' work, it is a lightly written, enjoyable read.<br /><br />The story itself finds Inspector Felse, his wife Bunty, and their just-adult son Dominic on a seaside vacation--where they encounter Simon Towne, well known author and lecturer.  Towne is present to open the tomb of Jan Treverra, a locally legendary figure who died in the late 1700s and whose crypt may include important writings.  But when the Treverra vault is opened, Towne and his assistants find more bodies than they expect.<br /><br />Peters often elected to work with highly contrived plots, and this is particularly true of EPITAPHS.  At one point, Peters has one of her characters comment that the twists and turns of the case are so ridiculous that not even a novelist could get away with them!  And it is true that most readers will see each major plot device in the offing long before it appears on the page. When the author writes more for amusement than mystery, this is not necessarily a bad thing, and Peters handles the most blatant aspects of her plot with considerable humor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the plot is not only contrived: it is extremely transparent. Any mystery reader worth the name will probably spot the killer by the fourth chapter because of the manner in which Peters sets up her tale.  Although it is a quick, amusing, and painless read, this is really one of Peters' weaker efforts.  Fans will enjoy it, but few will put it on the \\"must keep\\" shelf of their bookcase.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-06-16

Clarke's RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA was something of a surprise: a science fiction novel that easily transcended its own genre.  Winning a multitude of awards, the novel was widely read even by those who professed a dislike of science fiction, and more than thirty years later it remains a favorite.<br /><br />In some respects the novel is difficult to describe, for to do so will damage the experience of a first-time reader.  By the year 2130 mankind has spread throughout the solar system--and scientists identify an object thought to be a large asteroid just outside the orbit of Jupiter.  As the sun's gravity draws it nearer, however, it becomes apparent that the object now named Rama is not a natural one.  It is man's first visitor from the stars, and the spacecraft Endeavor is scrambled to intercept. What they find is completely unexpected.<br /><br />The single most powerful element of the novel is its complete plausibility.  The various scientific advances described by Clarke do not seem in the least contrived; they instead arise logically from the science of our day.  The story itself is unique, dismissing both \\"alien invasion\\" cliches and the tired fantasy of the so-called \\"space opera\\" style; there is not the faintest whiff of fantasy, and everything is grounded by Clarke's simple and direct writing style.<br /><br />For several years the film industry has been awash in rumors of a movie version--and at this time it does seem that one is in the offing.  But it will have to go quite a way to equal the novel, which remains one of the most completely original in all of science fiction literature.  Fun, tantalizing, memorable--all the overworked adjectives really do apply to RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA.  I strongly recommend it.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-06-15

Mary Bellamy, famous for her \\"v\\" shaped smile and her way with light comedy, has long been known as one of the leading lights of the stage.  Indeed, it may have been a bit too long: her temper tantrums have become as legendary as her career, and her 50th birthday provides ample showcase for them.  Before the day is out she will snap, snarl, create two extremely nasty scenes--and end up dead, literally a victim of her own vanity.<br /><br />Marsh is renowned for her skill at creating both memorable characters and settings, and she often gives her novels a theatrical background; it was world she knew well, and she digs her nails into every scrap of it.  But Marsh's plots are not always the equal of her literary skill, and this is somewhat true of FALSE SCENT; although the novel is tremendous fun, a good many readers will spot the killer midway through the book.  Still, with Marsh getting there is often the fun, and while FALSE SCENT doesn't really stand among the best of her best, it is a vastly entertaining reading.

Unfortunately, they are also among the most financially irresponsible aristocrats imaginable, always going broke.  Even so, they have always managed to escape the public humiliation of bankruptcy--until, that is, a dubious business partnership explodes around them.<br /><br />Only one hope stands between the Lampreys and complete disaster: that Lord Charles Lamprey's older brother, Lord Wutherwood, may be enticed to come to the rescue.  But Lord Wutherwood is largely immune to the legendary Lamprey family charm--and more than a little miserly--and the mix of eccentricity, family titles, and money proves lethal.<br /><br />Written on the eve of World War II, many critics regard DEATH OF A PEER (also published as A SURFEIT OF LAMPREYS) as Ngaio Marsh's single finest novel.  I think that's arguable, but no matter how you look at, it is certainly one of Marsh's best.  Marsh's skill at creating fascinating characters and memorable settings often outstrips her way with a plot--but in this instance the elements balance beautifully, and the result is a pager-turner from start to finish.

Henry Memorial Award and the Edgar Allan Poe Award.  But in spite of her tremendous fame in Europe, she did not win fame in her native United States until after death, when the 1999 film version of her 1955 novel THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY at last brought her work the recognition it had long deserved.<br /><br />The 1950 novel STRANGERS ON A TRAIN was Highsmith's first novel, and the premise was so intriguing that no less than legendary director Alfred Hitchcock snapped up the movie rights and turned it into one of his most admired films.  The Hitchcock film is a classic of its kind--but even so the novel was both too hot and too dark to be filmed \\"as is\\" in the repressive 1950s.  Readers who come to the book from the film are in for a surprise.<br /><br />The very famous point on which the plot turns, however, is the same.  Two men, Guy and Bruno, meet by chance on a train and pass the time in conversation.  Each reveals to the other that a specific person stands in the way of happiness: for Guy, it is a wayward wife who refuses to give him a divorce; for Bruno it is a stubborn father who refuses him money.  When Bruno playfully suggests that he will kill the wife for Guy if Guy will kill the father for Bruno it seems like a bad-taste joke... But Guy will soon discover there is nothing to laugh about at all.<br /><br />From this opening salvo Highsmith unwinds and rewinds her plot in a manner distinctly different from the Hitchcock film, and even today the book is best known for its fiendish storyline.  But it is the characters that make it work, and Bruno emerges as one of the most brilliantly constructed psychopaths of 20th Century fiction.  By turns comic, pitiful, stupid, and witty, Bruno's insignificant veneer masks a truly deadly turn of mind.  The all-American-honest Guy is no less memorable as his personality slowly but surely deteriorates under Bruno's pressure, and even the most minor of characters pop and sizzle with life under Highsmith's pen.<br /><br />Although long out of print in the United States, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is back with a vengeance--and the icy, direct, and darkly comic tone of the novel sets it among the best of Highsmith's remarkable work.

In its final form, the collection contained two hundred folk tales and ten \\"Children's Legends,\\" and they would have a tremendous impact on both European and American popular culture.<br /><br />It is here that we find such figures as Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Hansel and Gretle, Tom Thumb, Rapunzel, and the Bremen Town Musicians--to name but a few.  But be forewarned: these are not the tales as presented in such venues as The Little Golden Book series or on the big screen by Walt Disney.  True enough, there is magic, wonder, and a world in which good triumphs... but there is also savage retribution, revenge, brutality, torture, and the occasional flourish of anti-semetism as well.<br /><br />\\"Cinderella\\" offers a good example of the violence one often finds in these stories.  Modern versions typically punish the wicked step-sisters with comic humiliation, but in the original tale their eyes are picked out by birds--and this is actually one of the less extreme retributions offered.  The evil queen in the classic \\"Snow White\\" is forced to dance at Snow White's wedding... in red-hot iron shoes until she dies.  Perhaps most disconcerting is the fate of the wicked servant in \\"The Goose Girl,\\" who is thrown naked into a barrel driven through with spikes that is dragged by horses through the town!<br /><br />Although children typically adore such gruesome details, modern parents will likely be less enthusiastic--and I myself wouldn't recommend The Brothers Grimm as bedtime story material for the very young and impressionable.  They are perhaps best left to older children, especially if their taste leans to the Gothic.  That said, however, the Pantheon edition is quite good, for it offers both the original German texts and English translations; it would make an excellent gift for a young language student.

There's a reason for that: it is one of the most compulsively readable novels I have encountered, a novel that I picked up one Saturday afternoon and read all the way to the end in a single sitting.<br /><br />The novel concerns Cassie Barrett, a 1970s Cleveland housewife who seems to have everything the American dream requires: a nice looking husband, three children, and a comfortable home.  And she hates her life.  She hates it so much that she turns to the bottle for comfort--and on the novel's first page awakens with a horrible hangover to discover that she has been committed to the psych ward of a local hospital.  For the second time.  But will another stay at \\"the cracker factory\\" prove any more beneficial to her than the first?  She has her doubts.<br /><br />Writing in the first person, Burditt-Rebeta captures Cassie, her family, her doctor and nurses, and her fellow patients with sharp perception and tremendous witt--and Cassie herself is one of the funniest, most irreverent women of 20th Century popular fiction I've ever met, capable of making you laugh and then cry within a single sentence.  And her adventures, both with those around her and inside herself, are memorably portrayed.<br /><br />While the novel has a few very minor short comings, they certainly don't get in the way of reading enjoyment, and when all is said and done this is a novel which deserves a great deal more attention than it currently receives.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-05-02

The fictional material concerns Jim, a man that the rest of the book encourages us to read as Rechy himself, who travels a stream of sexual contacts over the course of a long weekend: sex at the beach, in the park, on the street, in the bar, in the alley.  And always running one step ahead of a highly hypocritical society and police department that is forever in hot pursuit to arrest, eradicate, and destroy him and his kind forever.<br /><br />These are the \\"sexual outlaws.\\"  The remaining portions of the book veers from sado-masochism to double sexual standards to corrupt police officers to newspaper headlines--and all, ultimately, in an effort to explain why a person such as \\"Jim\\" would actively select such a nihilistic way of life.  And Rechy does indeed have a point; to a certain extent, the choice is between rebelling against or being buried by the status quo.<br /><br />In one sense, the book will--or at least should--make your blood boil in its highly accurate depiction of the horrific repression homosexuals have faced in the past and indeed might again face in the future.  It also conveys a sense of the excitement of the illicit sexual chase.  At the same time, Rechy does not spare you the emptiness and ugliness of such a lifestyle; indeed, he makes such aspects of wholesale promiscuity extremely apparent.<br /><br />In the end, Rechy seems to be saying that when the choice is between rebelling or being buried, he prefers to rebel.  But there is a catch in here: he presents a street-sex lifestyle as the only possible rebellion and to a certain extent tries to posit his own choices as a commonplace.<br /><br />At one point in the book, Rechy states that he has had over 7000 sexual contacts up that point--which breaks down to an average of about one contact per day for twenty years.  I don't doubt that such people exist and I don't doubt that some of them are homosexual, but I have extreme doubts about how statistically typical this would be of any segment of the population, male or female, gay or straight.<br /><br />Because of this Rechy tends to undercut his own argument, and a whiff of self-justification begins to enter the mix as the book progresses.  That aside, the adventures of Jim become repetitive and seem less included than to make a point than as expertly written pornography.  I need hardly add that the advent of AIDS and changing attitudes and laws about homosexuality have left the book extremely dated.<br /><br />Even so, this is in some respects the best of Rechy's work, very direct, passionate, clearly written in white-hot anger; it is remarkably driven in tone, furious in execution.  I would not really recommend it to a casual reader, but I think it is important as a social document, and it deserves to be read on that basis.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerain extent tries to posit his own choices as a commonplace. <br /> <br />At one point in the book, Rechy states that he has had over 7000 sexual contacts up that point--which breaks down to an average of about one contact per day for twenty years.

By dawn 131 people were known dead and another 41 were missing, never to be recovered.  Communities on the eastern side of the Mississippi gulf coast sustained significant damage; communities on the central and western Mississippi gulf coast were devastated.  The remnants of the storm then flashed north, bringing torrential rains that touched off flash floods that claimed another hundred lives in Virginia and West Virginia.<br /><br />I, all of eight years old at the time, was on the edge of the storm.  My family resided in Pascagoula, a Mississippi coastal community near the Alabama border.  We evacuated, and although Pascagoula sustained significant damage it was mild in comparison to what we saw when we--like many others--raced to take food, water, and clothing to friends who resided further west.  The images are burned into my brain.<br /><br />For many years I wondered why a historian did not turn attention to the horrors of Hurricane Camille.  In 2004 I was pleased to find that one had: Philip D. Hearn, working from documentation at the University of Southern Mississippi, published HURRICANE CAMILLE: MONSTER STORM OF THE GULF COAST.  The book debuted with considerable fanfare on the Mississippi gulf coast--but, unlike its subject, just as quickly made a noise like a hoop and rolled away.  Consequently I did not come to the book until two years after its publication.  Upon reading the book I understood why it failed to satisfy.<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I do not feel that Hearn is a bad writer per se; it is very clear, however, that he lacks the gift for sustained narrative, and his academic tone undercuts most of the human drama involved.  His scope is also remarkably small: excluding preface and end notes, CAMILLE runs to slightly less than two hundred pages in slightly larger-than-usual typeface, and of its seven chapters at least two focus more upon the general history of hurricane strikes and the process of their formation than upon Hurricane Camille itself.<br /><br />The end result rather like a credible if uninspired master's thesis.  It is, at best, a minor account of a major catastrophe--and I found myself repeatedly frustrated with what I considered Hearn's failure to follow up interesting events and details in favor of information that seemed more properly suited to end notes.  Still, now and then the personal accounts from which Hearn worked breaks through in a real and very powerful way; Hearn also does, I think, a very effective job in dispelling the myth of the \\"hurricane party\\" that was said to have been held at the ill-fated Richelieu Apartments.  For these reasons I cannot bring myself to dismiss the book out of hand.<br /><br />Some thirty years ago Biloxi, Mississippi and coastal cities further west were flattened by Camille.  Today, with the advent of casino gaming and the ensuing construction boom, a tourist would be hard pressed to notice anything unusual about the area.  But I, who now live in this city, can take you to the beach and point out the island that was split into two sections by the storm; I can take you to the marker, now overgrown with weeds, that notes the point at which the waves of \\"killer\\" Camille finally stopped.  On the night of 17 August 1969 a monster came out of the sea; those who felt its power, no matter how slightly, cannot forget it; and we still await an account that will do justice to the event.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerc tone undercuts most of the human drama involved.

I therefore felt a certain amount of reflexive pleasure when I encountered EVERYDAY PRAYERS FOR MEN.<br /><br />The cover is of a basic design and would not look out of place on a man's desk, be it at home or in the workplace; the book itself is also small enough to be slipped into a coat pocket or a brief case.  And the 96 pages include a mix of contemporary prayers and traditional readings, the latter of which range from Thomas More to Soren Kierkegaard to Teresa of Avila.  There are also a number of texts drawn from non-Western tradition as well.<br /><br />The best prayer, of course, is not the one read from the printed page, but one spoken directly from the heart.  Still, the assortment here is very nice, the contents are nicely varied, and the various passages do indeed ofter food for thought.  The texts are also non-denominational in tone and as such can be used by virtually an Christian regardless of particular church.  And in the midst of so many women-oriented prayer books, it meets a need.  EVERYDAY PRAYERS FOR MEN will not only interest the man who purchases it, it will make an excellent small gift for the Christian man in your life.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-04-20

Published in 1974, David Loovis' GAY SPIRIT is typical of the sexual self-help genre of the period regardless of slant.<br /><br />Like similar books, the vast majority of the text consists of the \\"exercises,\\" all described in purple prose.  Loovis recommends such activities as hugging a sofa cushion and imitating the head-bob of a walking pigeon in order to improve your sexual technique; he also warns against platform shoes, discusses the pros and cons of blue jeans, and recommends that you avoid clothing that doesn't contain at least some natural fiber.  Finally, toward the end of the text, he gets down to some extremely pornographic but hilariously un-helpful suggestions about what to do when \\"the moment\\" finally arrives.<br /><br />We should remember, of course, that the subject of sex (be it gay or straight) was still largely taboo in the early 1970s, and that most people didn't have anywhere to go with their questions; such books as GAY SPIRIT filled the void.  The trouble was that the writer didn't have to be an expert, just have a typewriter.  Any one could--and just about every one did--write this sort of thing, and a flood of these largely nonsensical books (not to mention magazine articles) was the result.<br /><br />They all sold quite well, even if just about everybody who read them in hopes of becoming a great lover was doomed to disappointment.  On the other hand, they were good for adolescent grins and giggles, and revisiting one of them a quarter of a century later will likely make you roll your eyes at the thought of just how stupid you were when you were fifteen or so--back when you read this sort of thing actually thought it might even be true.<br /><br />At most, GAY SPIRIT (right along with such other long-lost and equally foolish works as the best-selling EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK) is good for the occasional hoot of laughter.  Unfortunately, however, there are people who take it quite seriously today, more seriously than anyone ever did in 1974.  People with right-wing agendas are fond of quoting from GAY SPIRIT and other Loovis books as evidence of just how naughty those gay boys can be!

Sales in the United States were phenomenal, and by the early 1960s EXODUS had been translated into some fifty languages.  It would become one of the most widely published and widely read novels of the 20th Century.<br /><br />The novel was extremely topical, for it dealt with the creation of modern-day Israel, a highly controversial event--and one well within the memory of most adult readers of the late 1950s and early 1960s.  But Uris did more than this: he also painted a general history of European anti-Semitism with an emphasis on the Holocaust.  For many readers, EXODUS would be their first encounter with such material, and Uris took nothing for granted in his descriptions and accounts.<br /><br />The great strength of the novel is its narrative power.  The primary action follows a group of post-war European Jews held by the British for their illegal attempt to enter British-dominated Palestine--and their determination to break British policy--but it also flashes back to the tell the histories of the characters involved.  These histories, which reveal both Nazi atrocity and the long history of anti-Semitism, are often even more compelling than the primary story line itself.  It is very much a page-turner from start to finish.<br /><br />Even so, EXODUS doesn't quite manage to make the leap from 1950s pop fiction to the level of masterpiece, and it remains very much of its time.  Uris is an extremely literal writer, and he is less interested in creating plot and character than he is in using both to present a sort of \\"headline\\" history of anti-Semitism and the birth of Israel.  Consequently, both his style and his characters--although we certainly learn a tremendous amount about their experiences--read as rather flat.<br /><br />The novel is also somewhat controversial, for it is written from an extremely Zionist position, and for Uris this position is fundamental to all else.  Half a century later, however, it is very evident that the matter was never as simple as Uris would have us believe.  There are more than a few passages that will cause modern readers to think \\"But it didn't turn out that way, did it?\\"  And some readers may consider the novel as anti-British and anti-Arabian as the anti-Semitism the book so loudly decries.<br /><br />Even with these issues, EXODUS is a powerful novel--and in a historical sense a very important work, for it would influence American thinking on the subject of Zionism and Israel for decades to come.  And when all is said and done, it's still one helluva read.

Many consider it the best of the Chan novels--as much for the memorable way in which Biggers renders the Hawaii of the era as for the character and story he offers.<br /><br />The Winterslips are a socially formidable Boston family, the members of which are touched by occasional fits of wanderlust.  Several members of the original Boston family, including Dan Winterslip, have settled in Hawaii, and he is visited by cousin Minerva--a woman in her fifties who is so taken with the islands that she prolongs her visit to the length of a year!  The Boston family is scandalized, and dispatches Minerva's nephew John to retrieve his aunt.  But even as John's ship floats placidly in the harbor, Dan is brutally murdered in his bachelor home.<br /><br />At Minerva's insistence, John takes a hand in the investigation, and comes face to face with the memorable Charlie Chan.  Biggers is quite sly in his presentation, for both Minerva and John are shocked to find themselves dealing with a \\"Chinaman.\\"  But as the mysterious case progresses they soon find themselves, at times grudgingly, coming to respect him as both police detective and man.<br /><br />Like many of Biggers' novels, the plot is more adventure than actual mystery, but the characters are charming, and his portrait of Hawaii as it trembles between its ancient traditions and the modern world is remarkably effective.  It is quite true that the novel is \\"tainted\\" by the common racism of the time, and from time to time Biggers uses terms that are no longer considered acceptable.  But for all this, Biggers never shows his ethnic characters in a deliberately unflattering light; they are all part of the swirling Hawaiian society, Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, and WASP, layered together in an exotic array.<br /><br />It is a fun novel, and if taken within its proper context a very innocent one as well, among the most memorable of Biggers' Chan novels and indeed among the most memorable of Biggers' work in general.  Quite charming and recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerc array. <br /> <br />It is a fun novel, and if taken within its proper context a very innocent one as well, among the most memorable of Biggers' Chan novels and indeed among the most memorable of Biggers' work in general.

In this very absorbing book, author and interviewer Dennis Wholey meets with a few of them and presents their thoughts on how they became alcoholics, how it affected their lives, and what they did in an effort to control their disease.<br /><br />The book breaks down into several sections.  After a short introduction by actor, singer, and alcoholic Gordon MacRae, Wholey describes his own journey--and then launches into sections titled \\"The Beginning,\\" \\"The Progression,\\" \\"Quitting,\\" and \\"A New Life,\\" in which the likes of Doc Severinson, Shecky Green, Gary Crosby, Bob Welch, and Thomas Tryon describe their personal experiences with the disease at various stages.  Other sections include \\"The Woman Alcoholic,\\" \\"Alcoholism and Homosexuality,\\" \\"Wives and Alcoholic Husbands,\\" and \\"The Families of Alcoholics.\\"<br /><br />Although the book finishes out with information on Al-Anon and A.A., it does not actually \\"preach\\" either organization as a cure-all for every alcoholic, and several of the interview subjects found relief through various other organizations or techniques.<br /><br />You might suppose this book will be of interest only to other alcoholics, but that is far from the case.  With a broad range of personalities involved--Gale Storm, Jason Robarbs, Grace Slick, and Billy Carter to name but four more--it offers a truly fascinating look into both the individual and the disease.  It also offers inspiration for any one who has ever faced the need to make substantial life-changes for any reason.<br /><br />If there is a flaw in the book, it is that it has a slightly dated quality.  Although it offers a section on \\"The Woman Alcoholic,\\" the emphasis is on men, and the \\"Alcoholism and Homosexuality\\" section consists of a single interview that has, in many respects, suffered a great deal from changing attitudes and better research.

This \\"double header\\" volume contains two of his best: the 1957 THE CASE OF THE LONG-LEGGED MODELS and the 1958 THE CASE OF THE FOOT-LOOSE DOLL.<br /><br />THE LONG-LEGGED MODELS presents us with Stephanie Falkner, an attractive young woman and sometimes model who has inherited a chunk of stock in a small Las Vegas casino from her father--but her father was murdered, the crime was never solved, and now a very unsavory person is after her share of the casino.  Could her father's death and this attempted buy-out be connected?  Stephanie goes to Mason for help, and it isn't too long before a second murder comes her way.<br /><br />Like LONG-LEGGED MODELS, THE FOOT-LOOSE DOLL is the story of a woman in trouble--in this case Mildred Crest, an attractive secretary from Oceanside, California who was looking forward to marriage to the town's most eligible bachelor.  But when Mildred's boyfriend abandons her under shocking circumstances, she wanders off the beaten track in more ways than one... and<br />an unforeseen accident offers her the opportunity to escape the past once and for all.

Dazed and distraught, she gets in her car and simply goes as far and as fast as she can... until an unforeseen accident offers her the opportunity to escape the past once and for all.<br /><br />Or so it seems.  But the past has a way of catching up with you--and in Mildred's case it isn't just her own past that she has to worry about.

A trial lawyer himself, Gardner's best known creation was Perry Mason, a flamboyant criminal defense attorney who earns his large fees by virtue of a remarkable talent for using the law to uncover the truth on the witness stand.<br /><br />Although the Perry Mason novels are genre fiction pure and simple, Gardner was at the height of his powers during the 1950s, and this double-header offers two of his best: the 1955 THE CASE OF THE GLAMOROUS GHOST and the 1957 THE CASE OF THE SCREAMING WOMAN.  Written in a dialogue heavy, staccato style that recalls the likes of Hammett, both titles make for fun reading.<br /><br />GHOST is really among the best of Gardner's novels.  Eleanor Corbin is a flighty young woman with a history of getting into \\"scrapes.\\" And her current one is a dilly: she has been arrested for wandering around a park in a nearly naked state. Mason steps in at the request of her mortified family in an effort to control both Eleanor and the press... but when the headlines break it isn't long before Eleanor finds herself on trial for murder.<br /><br />SCREAMING WOMAN is not quite on the same level with GHOST, but it offers plenty of entertainment nonetheless.  When Mr. Kirby comes home with a wild tale about a beautiful but mysterious stranded motorists, his wife worries that he may have gotten himself into a jam, and retains Mason to show him the error of his ways.  Unfortunately, Mrs. Kirby's instincts are all too correct, and before too long her husband is in the hands of D.A. Hamilton Burger.<br /><br />Laws, police procedure, and forensic science have changed a great deal since these novels were written, but that's actually part of the fun when you read them; they offer a glimpse into a lost era.  And they are fun, often very clever, and now and then unexpectedly memorable.  Recommended as light reading.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-03-20

A trial lawyer himself, Gardner's best known creation was Perry Mason, a flamboyant criminal defense attorney who earns his large fees by virtue of a remarkable talent for using the law to uncover the truth on the witness stand.<br /><br />Stephanie Falkner's father was murdered and the crime was never solved.  She has inherited the forty percent interest he owned in a small Las Vegas casino and hotel--and now someone is buying up the remaining interest and seems determined to have her share no matter what.  It isn't long before murder enters the scene, and once again Perry Mason has to earn his fee the hard way.<br /><br />Like all the Mason novels, THE CASE OF THE LONG-LEGGED MODELS is essentially genre fiction pure and simple, written in a workman-like manner with an emphasis on staccato dialogue.  But Gardner was the peak of his powers in the 1950s, and in this 1957 title he has added a certain sparkle that raises the book above the pack: a combination of twisty plot and twisty legal angles that mix to create a fast and furious read.  This one is easily among his best!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-03-20

A trial lawyer himself, Gardner's best known creation was Perry Mason, a flamboyant criminal defense attorney who earns his large fees by virtue of a remarkable talent for using the law to uncover the truth on the witness stand.<br /><br />In this particular instance Mason is retained by a woman who asks him to cross-examine her husband about a peculiar story he has told--a story involving an attractive and sadly stranded motorist that he rescued the night before.  What interests Mason is the fact that Mrs. Kirby isn't the jealous type; she's only concerned that her husband may have fabricated the story in order to get himself out of a possibly dangerous scrape.  And unfolding events show that she's right on target.  It isn't long before a body surfaces and Mr. Kirby is in the hands of DA Hamilton Burger.<br /><br />The Perry Mason novels are pure genre, but they are genre fiction at its best, and while the laws (and certainly forensic science) has changed over the years they are still fun to read.  Erle Stanley Gardner was at the peak of his powers in the 1950s, and while this 1957 novel is a shade too preachy for its own good it remains a lot of fun.

A trial lawyer himself, Gardner's best known creation was Perry Mason, a flamboyant criminal defense attorney who earns his large fees by virtue of a remarkable talent for using the law to uncover the truth on the witness stand.<br /><br />Gardner was at the peak of his talents during the 1950s, and THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LOSER, published in 1956, is among the best of his works.  Mason is retained to attend a trial by a mysterious client--not as counsel for the defense, but to give an opinion about a particular witness.  The case concerns Ted Balfour, a wealthy young man who has been accused of drunk driving that has resulted in a death.  It all seems very open and shut, but Mason spots a few unlikely details, and when the case suddenly takes a very unexpected turn he finds himself acting as counsel for the defense indeed, and the charge is murder one.<br /><br />With plot details that range from a huge inheritance to a lovelorn secretary to an unexpected twist on the nature of double jeopardy, THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LOSER is quite complicated, but it never becomes disorganized, and when the truth is revealed it proves one of Gardner's most satisfying solutions.  Although laws--and certainly police procedure and forensics--have changed a great deal since this novel was first published, it is a tremendous amount of fun from start to finish.

A trial lawyer himself, Gardner's best known creation was Perry Mason, a flamboyant criminal defense attorney who earns his large fees by virtue of a remarkable talent for using the law to uncover the truth on the witness stand.<br /><br />Published in 1956, THE CASE OF THE TERRIFIED TYPIST opens with Mason in a quandary: one of his office typists is out sick and the other is too overwhelmed to take on more work, but an important legal brief must be prepared for delivery the next day.  An office temporary is the solution, but she behaves very strangely: she arrives in a nervous state, types most of the manuscript, and then quite suddenly disappears!  It soon transpires that a nearby office has been burgled, and it seems likely that the woman was involved, but as the matter progresses the circumstances become increasingly peculiar--and when murder rears its ugly head Mason is once more court.<br /><br />Gardner was at his peak during the 1950s, and while TYPIST doesn't quite make it into the \\"best of the best\\" of his work it is still an extremely entertaining read, smartly written and filled with enough double-dealing to both befuddle and entertain.  When the truth comes out it does seem more than a little far-fetched, but it goes off with a bang nonetheless.  Lots of fun.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-03-17

He was at the height of his powers during the late 1950s, and this collection offers seven of his best works featuring Los Angeles attorney Perry Mason.  Writing in a dialogue-heavy, almost staccato style that calls to mind the likes of Hammett, Gardner leads the reader through complexities of the law with considerable skill--and if these tales are genre-fiction pure and simple, they are nonetheless enjoyable for that.<br /><br />THE CASE OF THE GLAMOROUS GHOST (1955) finds Mason entangled with a young woman who claims memory loss, and her dead boyfriend is one of the the things she can't quite recall.  In THE CASE OF THE TERRIFIED TYPIST (1956) Mason requires an office temp--who suddenly disappears from the job and may be implicated in both robbery and murder.<br /><br />In THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LOSER (1957) Mason is asked to observe a trail by a mysterious client and finds himself more involved in the court case than he expected.  THE CASE OF THE SCREAMING WOMAN finds Mason called upon to play marriage counselor when a skeptical woman demands that he get to the bottom of her husband's wild story.<br /><br />THE CASE OF THE LONG-LEGGED MODELS (1957) finds Mason representing a casino heiress who is being strong armed to sell.  In THE CASE OF THE FOOT-LOOSE DOLL (1958) a lovelorn woman claims to have committed insurance fraud, and in THE CASE OF THE WAYLAID WOLF (1959) an office worker's refusal of a young man's advances has unexpected consequences to say the least.<br /><br />The novels include the supporting characters so much beloved--or loathed--by Gardner's fans: the witty and efficient secretary Della Street; the hard nosed detective Paul Drake; and, of course, such 'for the prosecution' figures as Police Lt. Tragg and the urbane but none-to-swift attorney Hamilton Burger.

A trail lawyer himself, Gardner's best known creation was Perry Mason, a flamboyant criminal defense attorney who earns his large fees by virtue of a remarkable talent for using the law to uncover the truth on the witness stand.<br /><br />Gardner was at the peak of his powers during the 1950s, and THE CASE OF THE GLAMOROUS GHOST, published in 1955, is a very sharply written and very clever work.  Written in a staccato, dialogue-heavy style that recalls the works of Hammett, it offers the story of Eleanor Corbin--a flighty young woman with a history of getting into \\"scrapes.\\"  And her current one is a dilly: Eleanor has been arrested for wandering around a park in a nearly naked state.  Mason steps in at the request of her mortified family in an effort to control both Eleanor and the press... but when the headlines break it isn't long before Eleanor finds herself on trial for murder.<br /><br />GHOST has a particularly complicated plot that ranges from lying clients to blackmail to smuggling, but Gardner is adept at keeping every element in the air until the last few pages, at which point they all click into place with unexpected logic.  Although laws--and certainly police procedure and forensics--have changed a great deal since this novel was first published, it is a tremendous amount of fun from start to finish.

What with a gifted but nasty author, an alcoholic actor, a hysterical bit player, and a host of other neurotics, opening night is more unnerving than usual.  In fact, it's pure murder, and Inspector Alleyn is soon on the scene.<br /><br />Ngaio Marsh is one of the great mystery novelists of the 20th Century, and she is particularly known for her skill at creating believable characters in memorable settings.  But she is also uniquely gifted at portraying the complex world of the theatre, a task she takes on in several novels but never better than here.  Marsh captures the contrast between the out-front-glamor and the backstage hysteria with the knowledge of an insider (she was, in fact, a theatrical director herself), and in VULCAN she offers a remarkably accurate, powerful vision.<br /><br />Although it is occasionally beset by some of Marsh's less admirable tendencies, NIGHT AT THE VULCAN is easily among the best of the best, a novel that will not only fascinate you with it's look behind the grand curtain, but keep you guessing in terms of plot as well.

Both A MAN LAY DEAD and ENTER A MURDER were fairly well received when they were published in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until the 1935 publication of THE NURSING HOME MURDER that the reading public began to take notice.<br /><br />England's Home Secretary is on the eve of both important political watersheds and not a few personal developments when he is suddenly taken ill and rushed into surgery.  But what should be a simple operation finds him dead on the table, and at least two two of those in attendance had good reason to wish him out of the picture.  Inspector Alleyn has his hands full with doctors, nurses, lawyers and such--and just possibly a political assassin lurking in the background.<br /><br />This is the first Marsh novel in which Inspector Alleyn truly emerges as a memorable personality--and in which Marsh begins to show her talent for both characterization and setting.  The plot is also quite striking, and medical technology aside the novel has a remarkably modern feel.  Marsh would go on to do better works, but that doesn't undercut this particular title, which is quite fine.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-03-09

His latest enthusiasm is to become a drummer with jazz band, and much to the horror of his long-suffering wife he manages to use his title to buy his way into one.  In the process, however, his step-daughter Felicite falls for ultra-oily band member Carlos Rivera--and when Lord Pastern and Bagott and Carlos Rivera take to the stage the result is pure murder.  Fortunately for all concerned, Inspector Alleyn happens to be in the audience at the time.<br /><br />Ngaio Marsh is among the great masters of the British mystery novel, and her particular claim to fame is not so much in her plots as in her remarkable gift at creating character and setting.  In WREATH FOR RIVERA she displays her ability to the full, peopling her novel with a host of memorable individuals and rushing the reader from the Pastern and Bagott household to a London night spot and back again.  In this instance certain aspects of her plot are transparent, but she also handles the mystery quite well, and it will be the rare reader who spots the killer before Inspector Alleyn tells all.<br /><br />Although WREATH FOR RIVERA is expertly written and in terms of plot may well be among Marsh's best efforts, I must admit that it is not among my favorites; like COLOUR SCHEME, which was written about the same time, the characters tend to emerge as extremely abrasive--cousins Carlisle and Edward are the exception--and in consequence it is less appealing than most of her other titles.

Unfortunately, Mailer also laces his mixture with a spot of blackmail, so it is no great surprise to Chief Inspector Alleyn, on duty in Rome, when a body turns up where no body should be.<br /><br />Among the great authors of 20th Century mystery fiction, Ngaio Marsh was particularly noted for her ability to create unique characters and place them in memorable settings--and WHEN IN ROME offers her the opportunity to do precisely that.  But in this instance Marsh overplays her hand. The novel is tainted by repeated condensending British jibes at Italy, some faintly hilarious ideas about drug use, and what can only be described as indirect but nonetheless obvious sneering fits of homophobia.<br /><br />In the end, this is novel that established Marsh fans will want to read--but it is also a novel that not even established Marsh fans will consider in the same league with such brilliant works as BLACK AS HE'S PAINTED, DEAD WATER, or OVERTURE TO DEATH, to name but a few.

Written in the 1940s or 1950s, the novel CURTAIN was designed to both vent her mixed feelings about the character and to protect him from continuation via another author.  It was not published until 1975.<br /><br />But CURTAIN was not the only novel Christie had written earlier and then suppressed.  Even as she grew less enthusiastic about Hercule Poirot, she grew more enthusiastic about Jane Marple, and given her sentiments about Poirot she elected to give Miss Marple the final word.  Like CURTAIN, the novel SLEEPING MURDER had been written much earlier, and it was not published until the year of Christie's death: 1976, a year after CURTAIN.<br /><br />The newly married Giles and Gwenda Reed have no close family but they do have independent means, and when Giles suggests that Gwenda purchase a house while he is out of the country she does precisely that: a charming Victorian named Hillside in the tiny coastal town of Dillmouth.  In her husband's absence Gwenda has a great deal of fun restoring the home.  But something odd happens.<br /><br />She decides to have steps set in the sloping garden--and when the work begins, a set of steps is found beneath the soil in that same location.  She decides to add a dining room door--and when the wall is examined workmen discover a door already exists in the spot, plastered over.  Gwenda begins to doubt her sanity.  Fortunately, she is distantly related to Jane Marple, who wastes little time in exploring the mystery.  And what she finds is pure murder, a murder from out of the past that bursts into the present and threatens not only Giles and Gwenda's happiness, but their very lives as well.<br /><br />Written near the peak of Christie's skills, both CURTAIN and SLEEPING MURDER are extremely fine mystery novels, and each one gives a suitable final bow to her two most memorable creations.  In terms of plot, the applause must go to CURTAIN, which is a truly stunning twister--but in terms of style, the applause goes to SLEEPING MURDER, one of Christie's most elegantly written works.

But was it suicide--or murder?  This is an important question for the Campbell family: a verdict of suicide will void Angus' life insurance policies, and the financially strapped family needs every penny it can get.  In an effort to clear up the matter once and for all, the family calls upon the famous (and in some respects notorious) Dr. Gideon Fell.  But no sooner is Fell installed on the premises than there is a second plunge from the tower heights.<br /><br />In addition to his way with a plot, Carr was also noted for his wit, and THE CASE OF THE CONSTANT SUICIDES crackles with laugh-out-loud incidents and dialogue.  And fortunately so: this is actually one of his more gimmicky novels in terms of plot, and while Carr is able to hold all his elements together for most of the novel, Dr. Fell's final solution rings false on several levels.  Even so, the charm of his characters and the wit of his style make the journey more than worth the effort.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-03-05

It proved a good move for Payton as well, who delivered a memorable performance as James Cagney's vicious babe in the 1950 film KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE.  The film put Payton on the Film Noir map in a big way, and at the time many thought she was poised for major stardom.<br /><br />They reckoned without the lady herself.  Payton was an extremely unstable woman who proved considerably less interested in her career than in sex, booze, and drugs--and her shot at stardom came and went with amazing speed as she indulged in one unsavory escapade after another.  Her last film was the 1955 MURDER IS MY BEAT, and she thereafter quickly drifted into prostitution.  By the early 1960s her going rate was five dollars per trick.<br /><br />In 1962 Payton was in the headlines again--this time because a knife wielding john had slashed her stomach open.  It was just enough publicity to tempt the publishing industry, which paid Payton one thousand dollars to make tape recordings about her life.  Heavily edited and significantly rewritten, the resulting \\"autobiography\\" I AM NOT ASHAMED was published in 1963.  It was not a success, and Payton herself, now largely forgotten, died in 1967 of heart and liver failure.<br /><br />These are the basic facts of Payton's short life and shorter career, but you won't find many of them in I AM NOT ASHAMED, which is both very spotty and very sloppy--and that's throwing roses at it.  Although Payton was said to have had affairs with everyone from Bob Hope to Gary Cooper, you won't find a mention of such, nor will it tell you anything believable about the night her boyfriend Tom Neal beat the blazes out of her fiance Franchot Tone, an incident that pretty much finished Payton in Hollywood for once and all.  This may be because Payton was too far gone by 1962 to give any realistic account of her life; at the same time, the possibility of lawsuit was very likely a factor.  Whatever the case, the result is considerable innuendo and little more.<br /><br />That said, however, the whole book is so completely prurient in an early 1960s-pulp way that it is actually quite interesting to read.  It may not give you the facts, but it does seem to distill Payton to the page; you can't help being shocked and often disgusted by her various stories, no matter how vague the details often are.  And ultimately, you cannot help but feel sorry for the pretty blonde girl who self-destructed in the garden of earthly delights all those years ago.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerllywood for once and all.

Tarneverro, a psychic to the stars, warns her to decline--but no sooner does she refuse the proposal than the \\"black camel\\" of death kneels at her gate, and the celebrated Charlie Chan is called in to solve the crime.<br /><br />Earl Derr Biggers will never compete with the likes of Christie or Sayers in terms of plot, but on this occasion he makes very clever use of details arising from one of the most notorious crimes of the day: the still unsolved murder of film director William Desmond Taylor, a crime in which several stars were implicated.  The resulting story is multi-layered and a great deal tighter than most of Biggers' work, and his portrait of Chan, Honolulu, and Hawaii of the late 1920s has tremendous period charm.

The result is a mixture of mystery, adventure, and an unexpected literary conceit: she transforms the ancient Greek mythology of the twelve labors of Hercules into a modern mythology of the twelve labors of Hercules--Poirot, that is.  And the resulting work is quite charming.<br /><br />The book will be best appreciated by those who have actually read a bit of Ancient Greek mythology.  Much of its charm comes from the clever manner in which Christie juxtaposes the physical strength of the ancient Hercules with the mental power of the modern Hercules and the witty way in which she transforms the ancient stories into a 20th Century setting.  The Learnean Hydra becomes malicious gossip; The Augean Stables concerns a dirty political scandal; and so on.  It is exceptionally well thought out and written with tremendous humor.<br /><br />The book consists of a short preface and twelve stories, two of which have been widely anthologized: The Nemean Lion, which finds a wily lapdog at the center of a dognapping gang; and The Girdle of Hyppolita, which concerns a missing art treasure.  And from a \\"mystery\\" point of view, these are very likely the best of the twelve stories, for on this occasion Christie is much less concerned with creating a head-spinning plot than she is in having fun.  But each of the stories has its own charms, with the concluding The Capture of Cerebus among my favorites.<br /><br />Many writers consider the short story the single most difficult narrative form, and many a famous novelist has run aground on the genre--including quite a few mystery novelists, Dorothy Parker among them.  But at her best, Christie was as comfortable with the short story as with the novel.  While this particular collection doesn't quite top her own Miss Marple's TUESDAY CLUB MURDERS short story collection, it is extremely well done nonetheless.

Hobson (1900-1986) is best known for the bestselling 1947 novel GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT, in which she exposes the anti-Semitism simmering under the surface of American life.  But this was not her only novel, nor was it her only novel on a controversial subject.<br /><br />CONSENTING ADULT concerns New York couple Ken and Tessa--liberal, intelligent, affluent, both successfully employed in the publishing industry, both happy with each other and their three children.  But when youngest son Jeff informs them he is homosexual he tests not only the strength of their love for him, but for each other as well.<br /><br />The focus of the novel is not so much Jeff as it is his parents and how they react to his sexuality.  Seen primarily through the eyes of mother Tessa, the novel spans a decade in time in which medical, psychiatric, and social attitudes toward homosexuality begin to undergo a profound change.  As such, it is in some respects a \\"snapshot in time;\\" as the novel begins, for instance, Jeff requests psychoanalysis as a \\"cure\\"--a common line of thought in the early 1960s.  But the focus of the novel is less on Jeff himself than on his parents, who find themselves at odds with each other over how best to support him and how best to react to his situation.<br /><br />The result is a novel that does not so much concern a homosexual person as it concerns family and social response to homosexuality, and it is quite a remarkable portrait.  How does one respond--particularly at a point in time when homosexuality is generally considered unspeakable--to a homosexual child?  At one point in the novel Tessa notes that, life-long liberal that she is, she would know exactly how to respond if it were the son of a friend or if she read an article concerning such a situation in the newspaper.

It was not until 1850, when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily's sister Charlotte, that it attracted a wide readership.  And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back.  Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature.<br /><br />Even so, WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers.  It is not a pretty love story; rather, it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness.  It is cruel, violent, dark and brooding, and many people find it extremely unpleasant.  And yet--it possesses a grandeur of language and design, a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written.<br /><br />The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback.  After a visit to his strange landlord, a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family--which he receives from Nelly Deans, a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights.  It was once a cheerful place, but Old Earnshaw adopted a \\"Gipsy\\" child who he named Heathcliff.  And Catherine, daughter of the house, found in him the perfect companion: wild, rude, and as proud and cruel as she.  But although Catherine loves him, even recognizes him as her soulmate, she cannot lower herself to marry so far below her social station.  She instead marries another, and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all.<br /><br />WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to \\"get into;\\" the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off-putting.  But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations.  Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable, both vicious and cruel, and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other.<br /><br />As the novel coils further into alcoholism, seduction, and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone: Heathcliff, driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world--dragging her corpse from the grave, hearing her calling to him from the moors, escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade, so that she may never leave his mind until death itself.  Yes, this is madness, insanity, and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond.<br /><br />It is a stunning novel, frightening, inexorable, unsettling, filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe.  Even if you do not like it, you should read it at least once--and those who do like it will return to it again and again.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerflow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations.

If so, you will find Paul Stroble's WHAT DO OTHER FAITHS BELIEVE an ideal text: clear in both thought and style, it states the basics of six non-Christian religions.  Short enough to read in a single afternoon but well-packed with enough information to fuel a group study program, it is easily the most accessible volume of its kind that I have ever encountered.<br /><br />After an opening chapter in which he sets forth the reasons that Christians should study non-Christian religious beliefs, Stroble provides a clearly written survey of the basic beliefs of Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and--dividing a single chapter--Sikhism and Baha'i.  In each instance Stroble begins with a brief description of the religion's history. He then goes on to describe the principle beliefs of each with tremendous clarity.  In a concluding chapter, Stroble returns to Christianity, and neatly outlines how these religions either agree or disagree with Christian teachings and beliefs.<br /><br />Although I recommend the book for individual reading, it may also be used for group study programs, and it contains many useful \\"sidebars\\" that amplify the material, recommend points for discussion, and occasionally suggest group activities.  I would point out that this text will be of little use to a scholar interested in exploring minute differences in religious belief--such will find it very fundamental--but it is easily the best foundational introduction of its type that I have encountered.

The result is a kaleidoscopic vision of the era, a novel that swirls with many characters, many locales, and as many sexual activities as can be crammed into its 350 plus pages.<br /><br />The novel is, in theory, a satirical condemnation of the lifestyle it displays--but Kramer makes a very fundamental mistake.  He tends to assume that this sexual hedonism is the norm for gay men.  He also creates a cast of characters who lack the inner resources to create any viable alternative to it.  Consequently, the novel reads rather like a cleft stick: Kramer condemns his characters for failing to escape from what he essentially posits as an escape-proof trap.<br /><br />That is a tremendous flaw, but it is hardly the only one.  With relatively few exceptions, the characters are shallow--and while that is part of the point of the novel, it also makes it very difficult to think of them as anything more than names on the page.  As a result, you tend to read the novel less for story than in order to see what unexpected sexual acrobatics might be described next.  And that's the hallmark of pornography plain and simple.  It becomes very, very difficult to accept the book as the serious work of fiction that it proclaims itself to be.<br /><br />There is a tendency now to look upon FAGGOTS as a portent of the AIDS epidemic--and certainly it does give you a very good idea of how easily the disease was spread within gay subcultures like the one Kramer describes.  But it is worth pointing out that Kramer was as oblivious to the impending disaster as everyone else, and whatever merit the novel may have as prophecy arises only in hindsight.  Ultimately, this is a novel that will most interest gay men who either recall this sort of subculture from direct experience or those who wish they did.  It is readable, but it is hardly original (Vidal beat Kramer to the punch by some thirty years and Rechy by close to twenty), and while it is reasonably well-written for what it is ... what it is isn't much.

Although dated by slang, changing mores, and the AIDS epidemic, it still bears reading today as a portrait of  gay street life in the pre-Stonewall era.  NUMBERS, Rechy's second novel, is quite another matter.<br /><br />NUMBERS is essentially CITY OF NIGHT repeated, but without the \\"shock of the new,\\" with less style, and with considerably less interest.  The extremely episodic story concerns Johnny Rio, a Los Angeles street hustler who several years earlier overdosed on the lifestyle and escaped to a solitary life in Arizona; now he's back \\"for just ten days\\" and, not unexpectedly, finds himself drawn back into the malestrom.<br /><br />There's nothing here that Rechy hasn't said elsewhere and often quite a bit better, and NUMBERS feels much less a novel than a series of strung-together sexual fantasies lacking significant point.  In this instance, the result is less interesting than annoying; readers interested in Rechy's work should pick up a copy of CITY OF NIGHT, his first and finest work, instead.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-02-17

Over the years, Glen Grant has made a specialty of collecting supernatural island stories--and in OBAKE: GHOST STORIES IN HAWAII he presents an interesting array.<br /><br />According to some traditions, including Polynesian traditions, it is unlucky to talk about supernatural encounters: the spirits may not like to be discussed--or, possibly worse, may not like the way in which they are described.  Grant does not, therefore, recount tales of the supernatural plain and simple; he instead distills and fictionalizes them.  The result is an entertaining, sometimes informative, and pleasantly written collection that honors island tradition.<br /><br />The stories cover a great deal of ground, but most of those collected under this title emphasize the Japanese tradition as it exists in Hawaii.  Opening with a tale of a faceless spirit, the collection goes on to numerous other stories of hauntings, possessions, and unquiet spirits--most of the stories set in Hawaii but a few traveling back to Japan as well--and all of them told in Grant's pleasant prose.  Given to me as a gift by a friend of Japanese ancestry who was born and raised in Hawaii, I have quite enjoyed this book, and I recommend it.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-02-15

You are immediate hooked by star David Niven's wild, wicked sense of humor.  Whether it is his Dickensian childhood, his outrageous tour of duty with the British military, or his climb to unexpected stardom, this is truly Niven exactly as you imagine he would be.<br /><br />Imagine, however, seems to be an operative word.  Niven was less interested in relating the facts of his life than he was in telling a good story and in putting his best face to the public--something that is not entirely unexpected in an autobiography, particularly the autobiography of a Hollywood star.  Later writers have noted that Niven played fast and loose with the facts in THE MOON'S A BALLOON, and that for all his charm he could be viciously despicable when the mood took him; it is also worth pointing out that he was never quite the \\"A List\\" star that he seems to be in his memoirs.<br /><br />But all this is actually a little beside the point.  Whether it is factually accurate and emotionally honest or not, THE MOON'S A BALLOON is simply a delightful read right from the first page, where we meet Nessie, the Picadilly hooker who introduced Niven to the joys of the flesh.  Approximately half the book concerns Niven's life before he arrived in Hollywood as a would-be actor, and it is a riotous ride; once Niven hits the film industry, however, he begins to name drop with the best of them--offering memorable glimpses of such famous names as director William Wyler and stars Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh.  It is all fascinating stuff.<br /><br />It can also be quite startling.  As just one example among many, when writing of his first wife's death Niven mentions that Joan Crawford stepped in to care for his children while he attempted to cope with his grief.  Yikes!  And although he was a great womanizer and cut a swath through Hollywood's beauties, Niven does no name dropping there; he does, however, describe an affair with a \\"Great Big Star\\" who was very likely Merle Oberon, the leading lady of WUTHERING HEIGHTS.<br /><br />True enough, THE MOON'S A BALLOON will hardly stand a cold factual analysis--but it is a tremendously fun thing to read, a joyous and fun book, and while quite a lot of it is of the \\"tall tale\\" variety it certainly presents the star as he likely most wished to be seen and be remembered.

The novel had not been popular with American critics or American readers, and the author was savagely attacked as \\"past it,\\" his current works dismissed as irrelevant and his earlier works as overrated.  Steinbeck was so humilated that he did not publish another novel in his lifetime.<br /><br />Part of critical reaction was due to the novel's structure, which jumps from third person to first person narrative and from character to character in an extremely jarring manner--and which in terms of plot seems prepared to run off in a dozen different directions but never actually does.  But it may be more accurate to say that the bedrock of critical animosity was the nature of the story itself: an unflattering tale of America at its most hypocritical and corrupt.  Given the tenor of the times, it was not a portrait that American critics or the reading public cared to embrace.<br /><br />Ethan Hawley is a descendent of a notable New England shipping family--but the advent of petroleum products destroyed the whaling industry and the family fortune declined.  As the novel opens, Ethan is a clerk in the very grocery store he once owned. His wife loves him, but is embarrassed for him; his two children, hungry for the luxuries of the small town upper class, are less discreet in their sentiments.  At least Ethan has the satisfaction of knowing that he is a man of integrity ... but one day, for no significant reason at all, his eyes are suddenly opened to the truth.  He can have it all.  But there is a price to pay: his conscience.<br /><br />Steinbeck's works frequently deal with the struggle between personal integrity and worldly success, but THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT is quite unlike his other works, for instead of painting the battle in broad strokes Steinbeck explores a gray area that gradually darkens to black--and suddenly ends the novel on a slightly ambiguous note, leaving the reader to wonder if Ethan will fight his way out of the darkness or merely strive to protect his family from knowledge of it.<br /><br />Perhaps more so than other Steinbeck novel, THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT requires a careful reading.  Yes, the structure is jarring, and yes the plot seems to run hither and yon, but at the same time these elements actually mirror the disconnected nature of the characters in a way that becomes increasingly disconcerting as the book progresses.  And while there is no doubt that the book is deeply flawed, there is no denying the author's power, a power that seems to arise as much from his failings as from his virtues.  As always, Steinbeck takes great risks in his work, and part of the pleasure in reading one of his novels is in seeing how well the gamble pays off.<br /><br />I would not place THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT in the first rank of Steinbeck novels--but it certainly did not deserve the scorn heaped upon it in the early 1960s and which continues, to a certain extent, to dog it to this very day.

Cartarette.  And when Col. Cartarette is found unexpectedly murdered on the banks of the Chyne River, Inspector Roderick Alleyn of Scotland Yard must determine whether foul play arises from an unknown explosive in Lacklander's memoirs or from a less obvious but no less lethal source.<br /><br />As is often the case with Marsh, the beauty of the SCALES OF JUSTICE lies not so much in the unfolding plot as it does in the characters and their setting, and Swevenings and the Chyne Valley offers her tremendous scope, ranging from the formidable Lady Lacklander to the eccentrically cat-happy Mr. Danberry-Phinn to the alcoholic archer Commander Syce.  Among her most interesting creations here is Nurse Kettle, a commonsense if excessively arch woman whose pleasing personality actually tempts Alleyn's sidekick Fox to reconsider his bachelor state!<br /><br />Marsh often writes in such a way as to allow the reader to anticipate the killer, but such is not the case with SCALES OF JUSTICE, and many will find the means of the crime ingenious and the solution startling, with both a legendary fish locally known as \\"The Old 'Un\\" and the wandering feline Thomasina Twitchett providing unexpected clues along the way.

But their lives have been touched with tragedy: their father, killed in an accident; their mother, unable to recover from the shock.  Grandmother Ada, Russian-born, has become the backbone of the family.  And Grandmother Ada has a game for them to play together, a solace for them in a time of grief.  But it is no ordinary game, this.  It is one passed down through the blood from generation to generation.  And it is through this game of the mind that Ada unwittingly unleashes a psychological horror that consumes everything it touches.<br /><br />THE OTHER is the first of the several novels Tryon wrote before his premature death and, although the novel HARVEST HOME is perhaps more widely remembered, to my mind it is his finest.  The plot has been extremely influential, and some readers may recognize various turns from having encountered them at the less talented hands of later writers who shamelessly borrowed Tyron's ideas.  But it hardly matters: the prose is absolutely flawless, dreamy, languid, and seductive even as it begins to unravel into a psychological void from which there is no return.  It is a rare reader who will not unravel right along with it--and immediately re-read the novel to see how Tyron has so unerringly cast his spell.

HANGMAN'S HOLIDAY, however, collects the best of her short story work, and while she will never compete with the true masters of the genre fans will find this collection far superior to Sayers' short story collection LORD PETER VIEWS THE BODY.<br /><br />HANGMAN'S HOLIDAY collects twelve Sayers stories: \\"The Image in the Mirror,\\" \\"The Incredible Elopement of Lord Peter Wimsey,\\" \\"The Queen's Square,\\" and \\"The Necklace of Pearls,\\" all featuring Lord Peter Wimsey; \\"The Poisoned Dow '08,\\" \\"Sleuths on the Scent,\\" \\"Murder in the Morning,\\" \\"One too Many,\\" \\"Murder at Pentecost,\\" and \\"Maher-Shalal-Hashbaz,\\" all featuring Montague Egg; and \\"The Man Who Knew How\\" and \\"The Fountain Plays,\\" which are stand-alones without reliance on a continuing character.<br /><br />Lord Peter Wimsey was Sayers' character of choice, and the four stories in which he features are enjoyably written, small sketches of the character who is better seen in Sayers' longer works.  But the real prize are the six Montague Egg and the two stand-alone stories, which have never been widely available in any other collection.<br /><br />Egg, a cheerful \\"commercial traveler\\" (i.e. salesman) representing a wine and port company, is quite different from Sayers' memorable Wimsey--clever but shallow all in one. The stories are also quite different in tone, emphasizing minute observation used to unravel highly specific puzzles.  While all are of interest, \\"The Poisoned Dow '08\\" is easily the standout.  The two stand alone stories are interesting for several reasons, most particularly because they show Sayers in the rare situation of working without a continuing character.  Neither story is so much mystery as suspense with an ironic twist--one can imagine them being filmed, for example, by Alfred Hitchcock--with \\"The Man Who Knew How\\" quite possibly the single most disturbing thing Sayers ever wrote.<br /><br />As previously noted, Sayers was not really a short story writer; her complicated constructions feel constricted by the form and her style seems forever straining against the restrictions of the genre.

Given the difficulty of obtaining some of these titles, the fact that Coward himself selected them as representative of his pre-1940s career, and the author's memorable introduction to the volume--well, when all is said and done, PLAY PARADE is a very worthy addition to the library of any Noel Coward fan.<br /><br />The plays vary tremendously in genre.  Noel Coward (1899-1973) is today best recalled for his sparkling yet acidic comedies, and PLAY PARADE offers three of the best: HAY FEVER, DESIGN FOR LIVING, and the truly brilliant PRIVATE LIVES.  But Coward did not confine his work to comedy alone; although often witty, THE VORTEX was a scandalous drama in its day, BITTER SWEET a sad and nostalgic operetta, and CAVALCADE one of the most successful serious dramas of the early 20th Century.  While some clearly play better on the stage than they read on the page, each is in its own way both remarkable and remarkably memorable.<br /><br />Perhaps the single most astonishing selection in this volume is the rarely performed POST-MORTEM, Coward's somewhat absurdist and ultimately dark reflection on how little the human race has learned from \\"The Great War,\\" known to us now as World War I.  It is difficult to know to whom this play was supposed to appeal when it was it was written; still, in spite of a rather obvious and simplistic tone, a reading of it is likely to disconcert moderns, who tend to believe that the various war issues that haunt us today are unique to the present day.<br /><br />This is not the perfect Coward collection--to my mind any volume making such a claim would necessarily include both FALLEN ANGELS, which was written early enough to be included in this publication, and BLITHE SPIRIT, which was not.  Still, it is very worthy as it stands, and a quick and painless way to lay your hands on most of the early Coward classics in one fell swoop.

Among his earlier successes, Coward received inspiration for the play when he visited the home of the great American actress Laurelette Taylor--and found both her and her family shockingly eccentric in an unexpectedly theatrical way.<br /><br />Unlike most other Coward scripts, HAY FEVER relies less on plot and Coward's talent for sharp wit than it does upon character.  Judith, directly based on Laurelette Taylor, is the lynchpin of the piece: recently retired from the stage, she is an intensely theatrical woman who enjoys dramatizing her life.  She has invited a much younger man to be a weekend guest, never dreaming that her husband David, son Simon, and daughter Sorrel have each invited a guest as well.<br /><br />The four guests soon discover that the maid is down with a toothache, there aren't enough rooms, and there is scarcely enough food to go around.  To make matters worse, Judith plays every scene that presents itself.  It is a habit in which she is not alone; her novelist husband and their two children are every bit as adept at theatrical hysteria as she, and before the weekend concludes the guests are treated to astonshing exhibitions that alternately annoy, confuse, and frighten them out of their wits.<br /><br />Plays are written to be performed, not read, and HAY FEVER is a good example of the difficulties that can arise when a non-theatre person tries to visualize how it would be on the stage.

The network considered it an immediate and expensive failure and the series was canceled as soon as contractual obligation allowed.  Isolated exceptions aside, the series was neither syndicated nor re-run and, with the exception of various \\"art\\" screenings it seemed to vanish completely.<br /><br />Nonetheless, The Judy Garland remains one of the single most discussed and written-about series in broadcast history.  Garland biographies aside, it is inevitably touched upon--and often focused upon--in histories of broadcast television, where it is usually held up as an example of how even the greatest talents, biggest budgets, and best intentions can be exploded by mismanagement, network politics, and in some instances pure spite.<br /><br />Two major publications have focused on the series.  The first was the 1970 OVER THE RAINBOW WITH JUDY GARLAND ON THE DAWN PATROL by Mel Torme, the respected singer-songwriter-composer, who contracted to write and arrange special musical material and make three guest appearances during the first season.  Torme places blame for the series' failure squarely upon the shoulders of Garland herself, painting a frightening portrait of a greatly talented but extremely unstable and often vicious star self-destructing through booze and pills and determined to drag all those around her down with her.  Although denounced as grossly inaccurate by many associated with the series, it was for many years generally accepted as authoritative.<br /><br />The second was 1990's RAINBOW'S END by Coyne Steven Sanders.  Amassed from meticulous research and seventy-five interviews with individuals directly involved in the series, it explodes DAWN PATROL with the force of an atomic bomb.  Sanders freely acknowledges that Garland was a tempestuous individual with profound chemical dependencies--but his interview subjects note that, far from being difficult, she actually withstood a great deal more unpleasantness from others than she actually caused herself.<br /><br />What ultimately emerges is a story of Garland's mismanagement, first at the hands of agents Begelman and Fields, then at the hands of such employees as Mel Torme, but ultimately and most destructively at the hands of CBS executives James Aubrey and Hunt Stromberg--each with their own self-serving agendas and all determined to drain The Judy Garland Show to further them.  It is also a story of great talents and opportunities simply thrown away.<br /><br />With the advent of DVD, The Judy Garland Show at last began to reach a wide audience, and the actual product bears out Sanders' contentions.  At its best, it was extraordinary, offering not only Garland very near the peak of her vocal talents, but a host of great performers that read like a Who's Who of 1960s show business--June Allyson, Tony Bennett, Vic Damone, Bobbin Darrin, Lena Horne, Ethel Merman, Peggy Lee, Jane Powell, and Barbra Streisand, to name but the most obvious, most of whom Sanders interviews to great effect.  But the program was \\"fiddled to death\\" by constant CBS reformatting, too often saddled with inept writing and insipid guest stars booked on studio demand, and ultimately unable to establish any consistent formula acceptable to both Garland and CBS.<br /><br />According to Sanders, Garland did indeed spiral out of control toward the end of the series--but given the madhouse into which she was thrown it is amazing that she did not run screaming down the street at the very beginning.  And, as Sanders so astutely points out, she has had the last laugh after all.  Few series television programs of the early 1960s, including those that bested The Judy Garland show in ratings, have survived in the public memory.  But The Judy Garland Show, for all its flaws and faults, seems to become more greatly respected with each passing year.<br /><br />After reading Sander's meticulously documented assessment of The Judy Garland Show, you'll never again look at broadcast television with quite the same eye.  Very strongly recommended, not only for Garland fans, but for any one with an interest in the medium.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerder's meticulously documented assessment of The Judy Garland Show, you'll never again look at broadcast television with quite the same eye.

Even so, I don't regret the purchase, for while it lacks depth it is indeed a useful starting point when one is confronted with a need for quick fact-checking re a movement, event, or name.<br /><br />Perhaps the most attractive thing about the volume is the short biographies it offers of various gay authors, artists, and activists.  Need to have a quick sketch of the life and career of James Baldwin?  Patricia Nell Warren?  Robert Mapplethorpe?  Not only does COMPLETELY QUEER give you the basics, it has no hesitation in discussing sexuality as it impacted on their lives and work--something that few other texts care to address so frankly and which is quite refreshing to find.<br /><br />The real trouble is that the text doesn't usually go far enough both overall and in terms of individual entries, and as a result COMPLETELY QUEER too often feels more like a collection of trivia than a serious reference text.  That said, some entries are less factual than they are restatements of \\"pop knowledge\\" that may or not have any real basis in fact.  I don't care what anyone, including Hogan and Hudson, has to say about it: although it seems possible on the basis of her work, we simply do not know for a fact that Sappho was sexually attracted to other women.<br /><br />Some of the omissions are also quite startling, particularly in reference to non-homosexual individuals who had major impacts on the gay and lesbian community.  Antigay campaigner Anita Byrant, who had a tremendous influence on national thinking re the gay and lesbian community in the 1970s, is mentioned on at least six pages but is not given a specific entry; Judy Garland, a major gay icon whose death likely contributed to the community mood that gave rise to the Stonewall Riots, is not mentioned at all.<br /><br />Still, Hogan and Hudson make no pretense of being comprehensive, and in spite of these flaws COMPLETELY QUEER is well written, entertaining, and makes for an interesting coffee-table or bathroom book--the sort of thing you can pick up for a few minutes and find both generally informative and intriguing.  Recommended in a general sort of way, just keep the above warnings in mind.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer>Still, Hogan and Hudson make no pretense of being comprehensive, and in spite of these flaws COMPLETELY QUEER is well written, entertaining, and makes for an interesting coffee-table or bathroom book--the sort of thing you can pick up for a few minutes and find both generally informative and intriguing.

Agatha Christie called it \\"one of the three best detective stories ever written;\\" G.K. Chesterton went further, calling it \\"the finest detective story of modern times.\\"  The ever-erudite Dorothy Sayers flatly stated that every mystery novelist owed something to \\"its liberating and inspiring influence.\\"  Today, however, the vast majority of the reading public has never even heard of it.<br /><br />The novel, of course, is E.C. Bentley's TRENT'S LAST CASE.  By most accounts, Bentley wrote the book on a dare--much as Agatha Christie would later write THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES. When financier Sigsbee Manderson is found murdered at his country home, a London newspaper dispatches part-time artist, part-time journalist Trent to the scene.  Within three days Trent cracks the case... or so he thinks.  But is his solution correct?  Or will it result in a terrible miscarriage of justice?<br /><br />From a 2005 standpoint, TRENT'S LAST CASE is not a remarkable novel.  Published in 1913, it feels overwritten, wordy, more Victorian in style than modern--and while the plot itself is interesting, it hardly compares to the unexpected twists offered by the very writers who so praised it and who were so influenced by it.  But the fact remains that it was the first: Poe may have created the detective story and such writers as Doyle, Collins, and Dickens may have wrung romantic changes upon the theme, but it really wasn't until TRENT'S LAST CASE that the mystery novel as we presently think of it was born.<br /><br />Most contemporary readers will likely find Bentley's style tough going, and although extremely influential the triple-twist plot has been done with considerably more drama in later novels.  But say what you like, TRENT'S LAST CASE really is \\"the first,\\" and that counts for a lot.  Worth reading for the history of it!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-01-14

For it is quite simply among Christie's most thematically intriguing works.<br /><br />Jerry Burton has survived an aircrash.  When his doctor suggests that he leave the mad rush of London for a calm recuperation in the country, he--attended by his sister Joanna--rents a home at tiny Lymstock.  The two are scarcely installed when they receive a truly shocking poison-pen letter, and they soon learn that they are not alone: similar letters are turning up all over the village, accusing the most unlikely people of the most unlikely sins.  And with such a twisted mind at work, can sudden death be far behind?<br /><br />In terms of plot, THE MOVING FINGER is one of Christie's more unexpected concepts, and she carries it extremely well, building a sense of mounting paranoia in a most plausible manner and offering a truly memorable series of double-twists.  The characters of the novel are also deftly rendered and, although at times stereotypical, remarkably memorable.  The novel is a bit too loosely written to rank among Christie's finest, but when all is said and done, it is a truly enjoyable novel that you'll likely gulp down in a single sitting.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br /><br />In memory of Cujo, 1992-2005<br /><br />An Orange Cat and a Dear and Faithful Companion, Greatly Missed	2005-01-13

But Coward was also a gifted composer and lyricist, and many of his creations graced the musical comedy reviews so popular in London and New York before World War II.<br /><br />Coward's most ambitious venture into musical theatre, however, was BITTERSWEET, in which he essentially revived a type of sentimental operetta that had been a mainstay of European theatre in the late 1800s.  Opening on the London stage in 1929, it received glowing reviews and ran a then-unheard-of 697 performances; the New York production, however, had the great misfortune to open shortly after the great 1929 stock market crash and a 1940 Nelson Eddy-Jeanette MacDonald film version was a notorious failure.  As a result, neither play nor music has been widely known to American audiences.<br /><br />The play tells the story of a young society girl of the 1800s who throws over a \\"good match\\" in order to elope with her music instructor--only to find that tragedy is the price of love.  Unlike the plays for which he is so famous, BITTERSWEET offers little in the way of wickedly witty dialogue, but it does have some of the most wickedly witty lyrics you'll find this side of Cole Porter: the unexpectedly naughty \\"Ladies of the Town\\" and the truly unexpected \\"Green Carnation\\" were shockers in their day, and \\"If Love Were All\\" has become one of the great standards of 20th Century show music.<br /><br />By and large, plays are intended to be seen, not read, and this may be particularly true of musicals, and it is certainly true of musicals where the music is unknown.  While I do recommend the script for Coward fans who are already knowledgeable of the music, for all its strengths I find it difficult to believe that a casual reader could get much out of reading BITTERSWEET.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br /><br />In memory of Cujo, 1992-2005<br /><br />An Orange Cat and a Dear and Faithful Companion, Greatly Missed05  <br />An Orange Cat and a Dear and Faithful Companion, Greatly Missed	2005-01-12

Specifically written to be performed by Coward and the celebrated husband-wife acting team Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, the play depicts the frequently bizarre, overly dramatic, and wickedly funny romantic tangles that arise between artist Otto, playwright Leo, and Gilda--the woman who loves them both.<br /><br />Although a popular ticket on both the London and New York stage, at the time DESIGN FOR LIVING was widely condemned as both amoral and immoral--and even today a production is likely to raise eyebrows.  Gilda has been inspiration for both Otto and Leo, but she wavered romantically, finally settling on Otto... until an evening on the town puts Leo in her bed.  But this is merely the opening situation; as the play unfolds, the various relationships shift time and time again, implying emotional and physical relationships both expected and unexpected, and the play concludes on an ambiguous note, leaving us to wonder who has, who is, and who will be sleeping with who.<br /><br />Although clever lines abound, DESIGN FOR LIVING is less noted for the sparkling Noel Coward wit that characterizes such plays as BLITHE SPIRIT than it is for the unexpected characters and situations it creates.  This is truly an \\"actor's show\\" that places huge demands on the players' talents, and it makes for a truly fascinating read.

With an incredibly large cast and a sweeping storyline that encompassed everything from the death of Queen Victoria to the sinking of the Titanic, the play was received by London as celebration of all things British, was highly lauded by the critics, and did a tremendous business at the box office.<br /><br />The play follows the fortunes of two families, the \\"upstairs\\" Marryots and the \\"downstairs\\" Bridges.  With the dawn of the 20th Century, both families are swept into the Boer War--and from then from historical event to another, often with tragic results.  Given the temper of the times, it is easy to see why the play was well received; even so, and in spite of its patriotic edges, CAVALCADE is a remarkably bitter play that ends not on a note celebration but of utter uncertainty.<br /><br />It is also a remarkably dated play.  Given the scope of the story, the characters inevitably feel superficial, and the episodic nature of the show's structure seems to creak at the joints.  It is worth noting that there has never been a major revival of the play.  There was, however a film: directed by Frank Lloyd and starring such notables as Diana Wynyard, Clive Brook, and Una O'Connor, the film follows the original playscript with remarkable accuracy, and although it too feels quite dated it nonetheless preserves an idea of what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Given its dated quality, this is not really a play that many will read for pleasure; still, it will be of great interest to serious play-readers, who will be impressed by its scope.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br /><br />In memory of Cujo, 1992-2005<br /><br />An Orange Cat and a Dear and Faithful Companion, Greatly Missedd Faithful Companion, Greatly Missed	2005-01-10

At the time, many condemned it as an exceptionally immoral play; read today, it seems old fashioned and a bit creaky, but even so it retains considerable power.<br /><br />Florence Lancaster is beautiful, spirited, wealthy, and socially prominent.  She is also middle-aged and fighting it every inch of the way, taking lovers half her age to shore up her sense of youth.  But her flagrant adulteries are merely the beginning of the tale: when her son Nicky returns from Paris he not only brings the young woman he loves,  he discovers his mother having an affair with one of the young woman's friends.  Needless to say, sparks soon fly on several fronts.<br /><br />What makes THE VORTEX continue to work on both page and stage is the cynical portrait it paints of the upper-class 1920s cocktail set, where the bright surface of social sprees conceal self-illusion, drug abuse, searing selfishness, and even a touch of implied incest.  While this will never rank among the best of Coward's work, in its own way it is quite a memorable piece of theatre, and those interested in 1920s theatre or Noel Coward will find it a worthy read.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br /><br />In memory of Cujo, 1992-2005<br /><br />An Orange Cat and a Dear and Faithful Companion, Greatly Missed	2005-01-09

Unfortunately, the 1935 DEATH-WATCH, featuring Carr's favorite sleuth Dr. Gideon Fell, is among the writer's less interesting works.<br /><br />The story concerns the discovery of a presumably homeless man who appears to have stumbled into a respectable boarding house--only to be stabbed through the neck with the minute hand of a enormous clock. Carr was greatly celebrated for his wit, his skill at description, and his knack for ringing changes on the classic \\"locked room\\" format, but none of these three gifts are seen to any degree in this particular novel, which comes complete with everything from roof-top meetings to secret passages. The whole thing reads like a lesser effort by Mary Roberts Rhinehart.<br /><br />In spite of these flaws Carr does manage to finish up with a remarkable solution that will surprise most readers--assuming, of course, that they haven't been worn out by the book before they get to the end.

Portcarrow Island is little more than a sleepy fishing village until young Wally Trehern, afflicted with warts on his hands, stumbles upon a spring--where a strange woman dressed in green tells him to plunge his hands into the waters.  Wally's sudden cure becomes the talk of the island, and when the story is picked up by the national press Portcarrow and the newly named Pixie Falls suddenly evolve into a minor-class Lourdes and a going business concern.

Although he was best known for the series of novels featuring English detective Dr. Gideon Fell, Carr also wrote a half-dozen or so novels set in Paris and featuring M. Bencolin--of which THE CORPSE IN THE WAXWORKS is one.<br /><br />Carr was particularly noted for the atmosphere with which he endowed his mystery novels, a talent for painting pictures in words that outstripped most of his contemporaries until the advent of Ngaio Marsh.  WAXWORKS is no exception: whether it is the strange wax museum, the mysterious \\"Club of Masks,\\" or the Moulin Rouge, Carr's gift is exceptionally well met here and more than worth the reading.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book does not have a plot worth mentioning.  When a young woman is found murdered in a wax museum, Bencolin soon discovers that the museum is a front for a fashionable club of the most depraved kind: a place where masked members of high society meet for sex.  It is a story in which one thing leads to another with a great deal of high drama but very little logic and rather less probability.<br /><br />Written in 1932, the entire concept of the novel is unexpected, but--while you can't help wondering if Stanley Kubric didn't happen to read this book before creating EYES WIDE SHUT--what was startling in the thirties doesn't necessarily prove startling today, and without a strong plot backing it the novel proves little more than a one-shot amusement.

Lights that may signaled to enemy agents watching, and sinking, military ships?  Certainly various members of the Claire family believe so.

In spite of this, however, I find it among my least favorite of her novels--for the characters are among the least likable she ever created, ranging from the downright disgusting to the tiresomely egotistical to the merely stupid.  While this should not detract from a first-time reader's enjoyment, it certainly doesn't make this a novel that you will likely care to revisit--and as such I give it four instead of five stars.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2005-01-01

(Rossum's Universal Robots) (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	5	27	31	N	N	Awkward by Modern Standards But Still Very Resonate	Today Karel Capek's R.U.R. is most famous as the work that introduced the word \\"robot\\" (from the Czech word \\"robit,\\" meaning \\"work\\") and for its conceptualization of a bio-mechanical device in human form.  Written in 1920, the play startled European audiences, but perhaps had its greatest impact on the New York stage in 1922, where it had particular relevance in the American upward-rush of industrialization of the roaring '20s.<br /><br />Although the ideas that Capek broached remain extremely influential, the play itself is difficult to evaluate from a modern point of view because in many respects it conforms to then-popular but now outmoded ideas about dramatic structure.  Even so, the story of a world gradually consumed and ultimately destroyed through its own technology remains a powerful one--as does the image of the robot, which gradually acquires an unexpected sense of identity and begins to vie with man for domination of the earth.<br /><br />By and large, plays are written to seen rather than to be read, and this may be particularly true of R.U.R., which proves very difficult to visualize from the page.  The seriocomic first act with its emphasis on exposition feels awkward to the modern mind, and the progression of the story has an obvious and awkwardly episodic feel.  But it is worth pointing out that if R.U.R. seems obvious to us today, this is because its ideas have been so often used; everything from METROPOLIS to FORBIDDEN PLANET to TERMINATOR, from I ROBOT to RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA has borrowed from it heavily.<br /><br />Ultimately, the play asks us to consider who will inherit the earth: man or what man has created?  Audiences of the 1920s found this an extremely disconcerting question--and if anything, audiences and readers of the present day will find it more disconcerting still.  A landmark in theatre history that will interest literary scholars, play-readers, and science fiction fans for generations to come.

The Condon novel, however, was both a critical and commercial success from the first instant of its 1959 publication, and although it has been in and out of print over the years it has never been less than critically well-regarded and tremendously influential.<br /><br />Readers who come to the novel in the wake of the 1962 film or the later remake are in for a mighty shock.  The story is essentially the same--a study in cold war paranoia concerning a Korean War hero who has been secretly programmed by Communists to precipitate an American political coup.  But both the characters and the tone of the novel are utterly unlike anything either the original or the more recent film version suggests.<br /><br />The characters are sick, twisted, perverted beyond imagination, often sadistic, occasionally drug addicted, and in one very notable instance given to fits of incest; the tone is that of a 1950s pulp thriller filtered through the blackest sense of humor to hit the page since Nathaniel West penned the utterly poisonous MISS LONELYHEARTS and DAY OF THE LOCUST in the 1930s.  Whatever virtue exists is comparative at best, and innocence does not exist at all.<br /><br />Condon is not a great writer--his style is too derivative for that--but he is a remarkably clever one, juggling idioms and shifting tones as he moves from the faintly improbable to the ludicrously impossible, sweeping away whatever objections you may have to create a portrait of a society where the strong consume the weak as a matter of course and indeed, without significant personal malice.  It one very big, very bitter pill, and when all is said and done you'll roll your eyes, shake your head... and then, with an unwilling laugh... admit that if the full truth was ever made known about American politics, this would probably be pretty close to it.<br /><br />Strong stuff for readers with imagination, but even the most hardened should brace themselves for the ride.

Joe Leaphorn was author Tony Hillerman's first detective, created for the 1970 novel THE BLESSING WAY.  He was a truly original figure: a Navajo employed as a law enforcement officer on Native American lands in the Southwest and a man with both a deep respect and understanding of the ways of his people.  The character Jim Chee does not differ greatly from this mold--but he does have one significant advantage.  By the time Jim Chee appeared in this 1982 work, Tony Hillerman had learned how to create a tightly woven novel, something that was not always the case in the early Joe Leaphorn books.<br /><br />THE PEOPLE OF DARKNESS introduces Jim Chee, a young reservation law enforcement officer who struggles to find balance between the traditional ways of the Navajo and the cultural incursions of the white man.  In this particular novel, Chee is summoned by a wealthy woman to investigate a theft; the circumstances are, however, extremely unusual--and as he slowly peels through the various layers of deception Chee finds himself tracking members of a cult-like religion with ties to a tragic accident more than three decades in the past.<br /><br />This is one of the better Hillerman novels.  As always, the author is extremely respectful of native American tradition, and he paints a fascinating portrait of traditional beliefs and patterns of behavior.  Unlike such novels as THE BLESSING WAY and LISTENING WOMAN, the plot is tightly constructed and winds back upon itself in such a way that one can honestly consider it a mystery novel--something that cannot always be said for a Hillerman work.  Well written, PEOPLE OF DARKNESS is a fast and entertaining read.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-12-19

Now based in Valencia, the company's meticulously crafted figurines, often presented in genre settings, have become famous and widely collected throughout the world.<br /><br />The text makes for a pleasant read, and is generally informative without swamping the reader with unwanted detail.  The opening pages offer a general history of the Lladro brothers and how they came to this particular art; later passages offer insight into the process by which figurines are developed and ultimately created.  Special sections include 'Animals in Porcelain' and essays on stylized, romantic, and literature-inspired figurines.  Passages on religious figurines, Asia-inspired figurines, and nudes are of particular interest.<br /><br />The paper is glossy, and as previously noted the volume is thick with photographs, all in color.  While the information offered is general--and be advised that the book does not include information on prices, which in the instance of discontinued figures can run very high--this is a must-own for either the novice or expert Lladro collection, and even those with only a passing interest will find it an attractive coffee table volume.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-12-10

Leaphorn as he investigates crimes on the reservation.  In this particular novel, Leaphorn, a Navajo, is summoned to Zunni lands to assist in a particularly unpleasant crime: a Zunni teenager's blood has soaked the land, but his body is missing--and so is the Navajo teenager who was with him.<br /><br />As usual, Hillerman writes in a strong prose voice, and much of the novel's interest stems from his depiction of the character, traditions, and lore of Native Americans who live on the reservation.  Unlike some other Hillerman novels, the plot is fairly tight and does indeed live up to its description as a mystery--but even so the mystery here is remarkably transparent; even the most niave reader should be able to spot both killer and motive in the first quarter of the novel.  That is unfortunate--but still, Hillerman's expert prose and his portrait of Native American society make DANCE HALL OF THE DEAD an interesting, entertaining, and often informative read.  Generally recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-12-08

But although it is a fast and enjoyable read, many readers will feel THE BLESSING WAY isn't all it is cracked up to be.<br /><br />THE BLESSING WAY introduces Lt. Joe Leaphorn, a Native American at work on Navajo lands in the southwest.  The story opens well: a young man has fled to a remote area of the reservation to avoid arrest, and Leaphorn pursues him.  At the same time, Leaphorn helps a professor of Native American traditions who has come to the reservation to research Navajo witchcraft lore. But the case takes unexpected turn when the two elements suddenly combine: the young man is found dead and rumors of a witch abound.<br /><br />All of this sounds good, but there's less to it than you might expect.  The basic problem with THE BLESSING WAY is the basic problem with most of Hillerman's work: while he renders his characters and their setting with considerable interest, he pretty much leaves the plot to take care of itself, and the end result feels contrived in a way that makes the overall work feel remarkably thin.  The novel's translation of Navajo tradition and lore to a pop-fiction format is intriguing, at times greatly interesting--but in the end it really is pop-fiction and nothing more.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-12-04

And such is the case with SIMISOLA, a novel that finds unassuming Inspector Wexford first in search of a missing girl and then in search of a vicious killer.<br /><br />As usual, Rendell writes with a graceful touch and brings a certain amount of social commentary into her novel, in this instance elaborating on both racism and joblessness in England.  This sounds a promising mix, but Rendell proves quite typical of herself: when all is said and done most of her social commentary seems to have little to do with the story beyond providing a foggy sort of background to a somewhat forced conclusion.  The ultimate effect is that of a novel you read a bit of and then put down--and maybe you pick it up again and maybe you don't.  Certainly not one of her more interesting efforts.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-11-27

I have never understood this; from my own point of view, her psychological insight usually consists of inconsistencies and uncertain motivations--the latter of which most often arise from a vaguely drawn plot that seldom has any \\"mystery\\" to it at all.<br /><br />Clearly, I am not among Rendell's fans.  Still, if I were hard pressed to recommend a Rendell novel, I would most likely recommend A SLEEPING LIFE--for although very typical of her work in terms of character, it is indeed a reasonably well structured mystery with a double-folded solution that few will completely anticipate.<br /><br />The story concerns Rhoda Comfrey, an unattractive woman of fifty years whose body is found twice-stabbed along a path.  But when Inspector Wexford attempts to trace Comfrey's movements, he is unexpectedly stymied: although her bed-ridden father resides in the area, she herself does not--and although it is generally understood that she lives in London, no one has any idea where, nor does an appeal through the press bring forth her address, her occupation, or even any one in all of England who has seen her, much less actually knows her.<br /><br />As the days pass in mounting frustration, Inspector Wexford gradually finds himself also drawn into the somewhat suspicious absence of noted novelist Grenville West, who may or may not know Comfrey and who may or may not have suddenly disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  Is there any connection--or is it just another wild goose chase so typical of this particular case?<br /><br />In spite of my general dislike of Rendell's work, I found myself quite caught up in this particular title, which shows Rendell at her stylistic best and working with intriguing characters and a well-organized story.  If you must read a Ruth Rendell novel, this would be a good choice.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-11-16

Van Dine (the pen name of Willard-Huntington Wright) was a noted critic who turned to writing detective fiction following a nervous collapse from overwork.  His first novel, THE BENSON MURDER CASE, was a spectacular success, and  throughout the 1920s he was considered among the finest writers of the mystery genre.<br /><br />Many regard his second novel, THE CANARY MURDER CASE, as his single best work.  Concerning the murder of a popular New York star, the novel presents Van Dine's hero Philo Vance confronted with the \\"locked-room\\" murder mystery to end all locked-room murder mysteries--and discovering that each new fact makes the puzzle seem even more impossible than before.  It would also prove among the most influential of his novels, broaching ideas that would later be elaborated by such notable mystery novelists as Agatha Christie.<br /><br />But time has not been kind to Van Dine's work.  Van Dine wrote in a very wordy, almost academic style--something quite new and unexpected when CANARY was published in 1927.  Unfortunately, once the shock of new wears off, his work reads as dry as dust, as serious and humorless as a scholarly disertation.  It was an effect that readers and critics began to realize more fully with each new Van Dine novel, and even by the time of his death in 1939 Van Dine's work was regarded as more tedious than interesting.<br /><br />Van Dine is often compared to England's Dorothy Sayers, who also used a complex and highly literate style and whose detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, was even more artistocratic than Van Dine's Philo Vance.  But Van Dine lacked Sayers' gift for making wild complexities, both in plot and language, entertaining--and he certainly never had the energy that Sayers brought to her work.  In the end, THE CANARY MURDER CASE is an exceptionally uphill read, one that will interest only hardcore mystery fans who desire to trace the development of the genre.

For while it contains an occasionally interesting idea, MONKEY PUZZLE is rife with a host of stereotypes that range from tiresome to extremely distasteful.<br /><br />The victim is English professor Adamson, who is seated at his office looking at hardcore gay pornography when he is first struck on the head, then repeatedly stabbed, and then mutilated.  But detective Lt. Stryker is puzzled: Adamson was likely murdered by another homosexual, but if so, why wasn't he sexually mutilated?  Gee Whiz!  That's how they kill, you know!  And indeed, the fact that Adamson wasn't sexually mutilated is one of several reasons that steer Stryker away from the \\"homosexual murder\\" theory.<br /><br />Outrageous as this is, Gosling takes the whole thing quite a bit further.  Adamson's apartment contains erotic art and has mirrors on the ceiling!  It naturally follows that he is completely evil--and true to form, he is discovered to be a blackmailer, a student seducer, and all around nasty sort of person.  Add to this portrait an equally stereotypical and distasteful portrait of a binge-drinking, not-to-be-trusted Vietnam vet and a cop-hating liberal professor who is still sexually turned on by the fact that Stryker spanked her naked bottom at a campus protest some twenty years ago... and you've got MONKEY PUZZLE.<br /><br />Now, all of this might be tolerable, indeed deeply interesting if the characters seemed real or if the mystery was mysterious.  But they aren't and it isn't.  Gosling's characters are merely names on paper, without any spark of life, and if you can't figure out whodunit by the time the killer attacks again you need your head examined.  So if you come across this novel at a rummage sale, do someone a favor: buy it for a dime, throw it in the trash, and speed MONKEY PUZZLE toward being completely out of print.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer, do someone a favor: buy it for a dime, throw it in the trash, and speed MONKEY PUZZLE toward being completely out of print. <br /> <br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer <br />	2004-11-08

This is something of a shame, for at his best Carr's work is second to none, and it would prove tremendously influential for decades to come.<br /><br />Called in to investigate the theft of a rare manuscript from collector Sir William Bitton, larger-than-life detective Dr. Gideon Fell is greatly amused to find London agog over \\"The Mad Hatter\\"--a prankster who steals the hats of the rich and famous from their very heads.  But when Bitton's nephew is found dead inside the Tower of London with a stolen hat on his head, Fell's interest quickly turns from manuscripts to murder.<br /><br />Although it is expertly written and shows his talent for both sly humor and memorable atmosphere, THE MAD HATTER MYSTERY is not really among Carr's finest works--largely because the plot unfolds through interviews with and interrogations.  Instead of reading about what the characters, we read about what they say they did.  To further complicate the matter, Carr presents his novel in \\"real time,\\" following Fell and his companions as they ferret out the truth over the course of a very long day.  It is an interesting concept, and one that later writers (including Ngaio Marsh) would borrow with great success, but in this instance it feels slightly artificial.<br /><br />Even so, in terms of the mystery itself Carr keeps the reader guessing right up to the very end, and I recommend the novel as a pleasant way to pass a few hours--and certainly one could do far worse than select THE MAD HATTER MYSTERY as an introduction to Carr's work.  While it may not be first rank, it is certainly top hat all the way.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-11-05

For this reason most non-theatre people find reading a play akin to a tour of purgatory: it is often extremely difficult for the layman to imagine how these strings of words on a page will actually play on a stage before a live audience.  This is particularly true of Tony Kushner's ANGELS IN AMERICA, a play which even many theatre arts people (myself included) find very, very flat on the page; consequently, I do not really recommend it for those without a background in theatre arts.<br /><br />Set in 1980s New York and subtitled \\"A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,\\" the play concerns a group of largely homosexual men who find themselves caught up in series of disasters that range from love to religion and from politics to philosophy--and most specifically caught between the rising tide of AIDS and a generally unsympathetic society.  In the midst of this, AIDS patient Pior Walter begins to have a series of visions, which may be fever dreams, medicine-induced hallucinations... or, most unnerving of all, real.  His long dead ancestors rise to speak to him, the floor cracks open to reveal a burning book--and at the conclusion of the play's first half a beautiful woman with majestic wings crashes through his roof.  She is the Angel of America.  He is, she tells him, a prophet, and she has come to bring him a message for mankind.<br /><br />Intertwined with Prior's other-earthly experiences are oddly parallel lives.  Joe and Harper Pitt are a deeply dysfunctional couple doubting their faith in the Mormon Church, Joe a closeted homosexual, Harper a valium-addicted and mildly psychotic woman given to visions as strange as those of Prior Walter's.  And as further counterpoint historical figure Roy Cohn (1927-1986), among the most sinister figures of 20th Century America, finds himself taunted by the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg as he drifts toward his own AIDS-induced death.  The characters swirl in and out of each other's lives and dreams, playing to stereotypes and yet defying them, arguing politics and philosophy and love and death--and it is fascinating stuff.  And the play, which ran six hours and had to be performed across two consecutive evenings, astounded theatregoers: nothing similar had been seen on Broadway since the days of Eugene O'Neill's MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA.<br /><br />But for all of this remarkable vortex of dreams and realities, issues and ideas, there is a tremendous problem with ANGELS IN AMERICA, and even the most casual reader should be able to spot it.  When an angel crashes through the roof you naturally expect startling revelations to follow--but having spent the first half of his play building to this amazing climax, Kushner seems to have painted himself into a dramatic corner.  The ideas, issues, and characters continue to swirl as brilliantly as before, but the angelic revelations and their gradual unraveling seem to be born more of desperation than of true originality.<br /><br />Is ANGELS IN AMERICA a play that will resonate through time?  It is possible, but I think it unlikely.  To return to MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA, that play is very much of its era in terms of style--but it deals with themes and ideas that are of all times and places, and in consequence it remains as powerful today as it was when it startled Broadway some seventy years ago.  But ANGELS IN AMERICA is not only stylistically of its place and time, it is also a play that deals specifically with issues peculiar to its place and time, and as our thinking about these issues change the play's authority begins to fade.  While it remains required reading (and ideally required viewing) for any one who is seriously interested in theatre, it seems unlikely that it will forever maintain that status.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewereath.

The most popular of these novels featured juvenile actress Jane Withers, about whom at least three such books were written, but others featured  teenagers Anne Rutherford and Bonita Granville and such glamour queens as Betty Grable, Ginger Rogers, and Ann Sheridan.<br /><br />Like most other books in the genre, JUDY GARLAND AND THE HOODOO COSTUME was credited to author Kathryn Heisenfelt, and it is very typical of the series.  Judy Garland is making a winter visit to a northern city, where she has agreed to deliver a Christmas gift for a friend.  The gift is delivered to a costume rental company, where Judy notices a beautiful white gown that seems out of keeping with the other costumes--and the owner is deeply disturbed when Judy points it out.  As a favor to the owner, Judy agrees to deliver the dress to its rightful owner... and quickly finds herself embroiled in a mystery that may include kidnapping.<br /><br />The novel is clearly written with an audience of pre-teen girls  in mind, and overall it reads rather like a Nancy Drew mystery.  Heisenfelt is careful to reference Garland's stardom only indirectly; although she has furs and jewelry, Judy takes the bus and uses payphones, her only concern a passing effort to avoid public recognition.  In a general sense, the portrait offered is akin to the \\"girl next door\\" image cultivated by such films as GIRL CRAZY and MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS--which is rather amusing when one considers that the book was published in 1945, by which time Garland was on her second marriage and was already notorious for erratic backstage behavior.<br /><br />The book is unlikely to appeal to modern pre-teens; today its real interest will be for those who collect material associated with Judy Garland.  Although the book has been long out of print, it remains widely available through various retailers, and Garland fans will find it an amusing if very slight addition to their collection.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweren long out of print, it remains widely available through various retailers, and Garland fans will find it an amusing if very slight addition to their collection. <br /> <br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-10-02

First published in 1916, THE AGONY COLUMN finds him very near the top of his form.<br /><br />Set in London on the eve of World War I, the novel finds American visitor Geoffrey West smitten from afar by a beautiful young woman.  In order to gain her attention he places an advertisement in the newspaper \\"agony column,\\" where individuals run cryptic announcements pertaining love, money, and the like.<br /><br />The young lady responds with the demand that Geoffrey write seven letters to demonstrate he is a man who might interest her.  But even as Geoffrey begins his correspondence, he becomes caught up in circumstances that give him unexpected subject matter: an acquaintance has been viciously and suddenly murdered, and he himself may be suspected of the crime!<br /><br />As in many Biggers novels, the plot is highly artificial and indeed becomes still more so as the novel progresses--but again as in many Biggers novels, the author's style has tremendous charm, and while many will anticipate the book's major plot turns they are so pleasantly written that THE AGONY COLUMN becomes a pleasant thing to read.

His 1873 book THE FAIR GOD was immensely popular, and such later works as 1888's THE BOYHOOD OF CHRIST and 1893's THE PRINCE OF INDIA were also well received.  But he made his name with a single work: BEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE CHRIST, first published in 1880.  An instant and massive best seller, it has been through countless editions, was one of the great stage successes of the early 20th Century, has been filmed twice.<br /><br />The basic story of Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince sent into slavery whose life later intersects with that of Christ, is extremely well known, and Wallace gives it all the blood and thunder that he can muster, cramming page after page with plots and subplots, brutal struggles, shipwrecks, famine, plague--and of course the famous chariot race that Hollywood would so well imprint upon the popular imagination.  It is certainly one of the most influential works of both its era and this era.<br /><br />It is also extremely, extremely Victorian, which is to say that the style is elaborately and deliberately wordy.  Detail exists for the sake of detail, Wallace never uses a single word when twenty or more will do, and his sentence construction drips with enough spurious punctuation marks to fuel an entire set of grammar texts.  The whole thing seems to go on forever, and the plot construction is heavy handed for good measure.<br /><br />If you enjoy the works of lesser-known Victorian novelists, you might find BEN-HUR to your tastes.

When he takes up residence, however, he is startled to find his isolation repeatedly broken by a host of unexpected visitors, all of whom seem to be lying about their backgrounds and their reasons for arrival.<br /><br />Originally published in 1913, BALDPATE was among the most popular novels of its day--and its mixture of mystery and comic banter proved equally popular on both stage and screen. The basic premise would also prove very influential over the years.  Still, and in spite of the deft touch with which Biggers handles the material, today the novel reads as highly artificial in both tone and construction.  Fans of period pop fiction will likely enjoy it, but the book is unlikely to hold many charms for other readers.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-09-11

At the time, however, the character was a marked departure from the Asian characters usually seen in fiction and film, both of which tended toward a \\"Fu Manchu\\" point of view. And it may startle detractors to learn that Chan was loosely based on an actual person: the legendary Chang Apana (1887-1933), a Hawaiian police officer of Chinese heritage who preferred a bullwhip to a gun and was noted for his fearlessness in dealing with criminals engaged in the opium trade.<br /><br />In the hands of Biggers, the character emerges as a considerably more thoughtful, more formal personality--and one capable of unraveling elaborate crimes. Originally published in 1932, KEEPER OF THE KEYS would prove to be the sixth and last Chan novel by Earl Derr Biggers, who died a year later.  And once more it finds Chan \\"on the mainland,\\" this time at Lake Tahoe, where he has come to investigate the matter of a long-missing child... and finds himself embroiled in the murder of a famous opera singer.<br /><br />In terms of plot, Biggers will never compete with the likes of Christie and Sayers; contemporary readers will also likely find themselves surpressing a smile over Bigger's assumptions in such matters as the nature of color blindness.  Even so, and in spite of its occasionally dated quality, Biggers writes with a great deal of charm and dash--and the result is pure entertainment.  Fans of the film series will also be interested in this novel's probable influence on such films as CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA and CHARLIE CHAN IN RENO, but this aside Biggers also offers considerable food for thought, particularly in terms of the passage of time, changing codes of behavior, and differing ideas about what it means to be American.<br /><br />Some of this is accidental: in the early 1930s Lake Tahoe was essentially a quiet summer resort, and the state of Nevada was less known for gambling than it was for the relaxed divorce laws that fueled the economy of Reno.  Some of it, however, is very much intentional.  Several characters in the novel, Chan among them, generally dismiss \\"scientific advances\\" re fingerprints and ballistics--but it will be precisely such advances that give Chan the final proof he requires to solve the murder.<br /><br />Most particularly, however, the novel presents Chan as a man of Chinese birth who has deliberately Americanized himself as much as possible.  And in KEEPER OF THE KEYS he confronts another Chinese, Ah Sing, who has refused assimilation and who clings with iron determination to the role of loyal, arrogant, and pidgin-speaking Chinese servant of inflexible caste and code.  In doing so, Ah Sing effectively forces Chan to consider the degree to which Chan has abandoned his Asian heritage and the personal cost at which he has done so.<br /><br />As in the other Chan novels, Biggers treats Chan and his other Asian characters with considerable respect; even so, and in spite of five previous Chan novels, he remains more than a little naive about both Asian culture and individuals.  Consequently, the novel is also something of a cultural artifact, a glimpse into the way that \\"white America,\\" even at its most enlightened, tended to regard Asians in this period.  No less entertaining and readable for that, it is a solid conclusion to the series that created one of the most beloved fictional characters of the 20th Century.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweran it was for the relaxed divorce laws that fueled the economy of Reno.

Originally published in 1926, THE CHINESE PARROT is the second of Bigger's Chan novels, and it finds Chan employed by aging and impoverished socialite Sally Phillimore Jordan to transport her last valuble possession from Hawaii to San Francisco: a string of remarkable pearls.  When the Phillimore pearls are sold to the wealthy and powerful P.J. Madden, Chan agrees to deliver them personally... but upon arriving at Madden's desert home he finds the circumstances unexpectedly suspicious.<br /><br />THE CHINESE PARROT pairs Chan with Bob Eden, son of the jeweler who has brokered the sale, and the result is more of a romantic adventure than a mystery per se--and modern readers will smile a bit over such impossibilities as a parrot that learns an entire string of words after hearing a single repetition.  Even so, it has a considerable charm, Biggers writes with a light touch, and while some of the author's attitudes are clearly a bit naive, he never treats Chan with anything less than complete respect.

In the 1920s and early 1930s, detective novels were not really considered \\"literary;\\" they were light entertainment, and they generally came in two varieties: pure pulp, which was more akin to action-adventure, and \\"the master detective\\" as created by such authors as Agatha Christie.  In one fell swoop, however, Hammett not only fused these two ideas but also endowed his novel with tremendous literary style--more than enough to catch the eye of \\"serious\\" critics and more than enough to stand the test of time.<br /><br />THE MALTESE FALCON is not a long novel, but Hammett packs a lot into it.  The plot, which generally concerns the theft of a priceless, jewel-encrusted statue, walks a fine line between pulp mythology and modern pragmatism, never veering too far in either direction to seem impossible; the prose is lean and clean and packed with detail conveyed both simply and sharply; the characters stand out in a sort of high relief on the page.  It is all memorable stuff.<br /><br />It is difficult to discuss THE MALTESE FALCON without reference to the famous 1941 film version starring Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor.  The film has been both a blessing and a curse, so famous that it has drawn thousands of readers to the novel, but so widely seen that it can become difficult to read the novel without seeing it through the lens of the film.  But while the film presents the plot and much of Hammett's dialogue intact, readers will find the novel has somewhat different strengths--not the least of which is Hammett's prose itself.  An essential of 20th Century American literature; strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-07-03

Cain (1892-1977) is at least their equal--and many consider that he bested both in his finest novels, which combined sin-blacked characters, sordid plots, terse prose, and all the power of a blast furnace.  This anthology collects all three of his landmark novels as well as several short stories, all of them showing Cain at the height of his powers.<br /><br />Published in 1934, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is the truly deadly story of a drifter who squirms his way into a job at a California truck stop--and then squirms his way into the bed of a sexy waitress.  Trouble is, the waitress is married to the boss... and she doesn't like it, not one little bit.  Dripping with lust, deception, and irony, POSTMAN is at once sickening and fascinating, a true powerhouse of a novel that festers long after the story has ended.<br />DOUBLE INDEMNITY, published in 1936, is equally hot--the tale of an insurance sales man who stays on the right side of the law until he is tempted by a psychopathic femme fatale who doesn't see anything wrong with picking up a few bucks on the unexpected death of her unwanted husband.  MILDRED PIERCE, published in 1941, is equally memorable in its portrait of a driven housewife with a wayward husband who discovers that she will do absolutely anything for her vicious, serpentine daughter.<br /><br />All three novels have been famously filmed, but while the film versions (most created during the 1940s) stand well on their own, the novels out distance them in nothing flat.  Cora, begging Frank to bite her lips until they bleed; Phyllis with lipstick splashed across her mouth like a bleeding gash; sleek Monte and his viper-like stepdaughter Veda--all portraits of reckless abandon so powerful that they blister the page.<br /><br />The volume also includes five hard-to-find Cain stories that are often as memorable as the best of his novels, most notably I think \\"The Baby in the Ice Box\\" and \\"Brush Fire.\\"  But whether it is novels or his shorter works, you simply can't go wrong when it comes to the best of James M. Cain.  Welcome to the inferno.

And in a certain sense the novel is indicative of Austen's great talent, razor sharp, laced with irony and wit, and remarkably phrased.  And yet PERSUASION is quite unlike Austen's other novels in the story it tells.<br /><br />Eight years earlier, Anne Elliot fell in love with a man named Wentworth.  Her family and friends disdained the match, arguing that the man was below her in station and lacked any fortune with which to maintain Anne in her accustomed mode of life.  Persuaded to reject him against her own will, Anne broke off the engagement--and thereafter found herself unable to love another even as she endured the follies of her father and two sisters.  But Wentworth has returned, having made his name and fortune with the British navy, and it is now his turn to reject her.<br /><br />Published in 1816, PERSUASION is the last novel Austen completed before her death a year later, and it is remarkable for a very autumnal tone.  Unlike such Austen masterpieces as PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and EMMA, the herione is not a spirited, quickwitted young women on the verge of matrimony; the hero is not a dashing gentlemen of great estate; there is no verbal duel between the sexes.  It is instead the story of a commonsense and pleasantly ordinary woman who considers herself past the likelihood of marriage--and who now wishes only to escape the emotional pain and humiliation visited upon her by a suitor from long ago.<br /><br />While PERSUASION does not really stand along Austen's greatest works, it is nonetheless a very fine novel, a delicately wrought tale of opportunity lost and the passage of time, told in the uniquely piercing style so typical of the author--and while, of course, all eventually comes right for the romantically downtrodden Anne, it has a touch of melancholy quite unlike the tone of her other novels.

Even so, I would warn users not to think of it as a houseplant Bible: its descriptions can be misleading and it includes a host plants unsuitable for use as houseplants.<br /><br />I was quite shocked, for example, to find Nerium Oleander listed as a houseplant.  Repeat after me: I will NOT bring Oleander, as either a potted plant or as cut flowers, into the house.  Not only is the plant incredibly toxic from flower to root, in a fire it also gives off a deadly gas.  If you must have Oleander, plant it outside, away from the house, and where leaf-chewing pets and children will not encounter it.<br /><br />The text also offers such plants as Coleus, Century Plant, Datura (also known as Angel Trumpet), Gardenia, Passion Flower, and Sago Palm, as houseplants.  Although these are not as dramatically unsuitable as houseplants as Oleander, I cannot imagine any one growing them in a casual indoor setting, and the same is true of many other listings.  On occasion I also found the text contradictory to what I find in practice, with Coleus a case in point; the text describes it as shade-loving, but I have always planted it in full sun, where it thrives as long as it receives frequent watering.<br /><br />Most of the photographs included are typical of the varieties listed, but as others have noted it does seem the authors have had difficulty finding good specimens of each. I have rarely seen a more pitiful looking Jade Plant, and while I have grown many a Datura I have never seen one as leafless and spindly as the one presented here.  Still, the photographs are indicative; even when the specimen is poor, you should be able to recognize the plant when you encounter it in real life.<br /><br />Final thought: pretty pictures, interesting text, but unless you actually have a greenhouse or are already very experienced with houseplants, you'll want to take it all with a grain of salt.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewert all with a grain of salt.

One such noisy book was 1961's THE SIXTH MAN, which went through at least six major printings and remained widely available well into the 1970s.<br /><br />All of sounds promising, but where THE SIXTH MAN is concerned there is a very major problem.  The book is about homosexuals, and Stearn was considerably less interested in getting to the facts of late 1950s-early 1960s gay subculture than he was in writing a pulp-style commentary that would tell white-bread, God-fearing America what it wanted to hear.  In order to do that, he focused on a number of ideas about homosexuality that had already been discredited by 1960, a series of questionable \\"professional\\" sources, and chatted up gay men in bars to give the whole thing some color.<br /><br />The result is a pulp-style book that wobbles between being downright offensive (even by 1961 standards) and unexpectedly hilariously (by the standards of any era.)  Did you know that their numbers are growing?  That one day they might take over?  It could be the end of civilization as we know it!  Well, given that civilization hasn't crumpled away in the almost fifty years since THE SIXTH MAN was published, apparently not.<br /><br />As of this writing, THE SIXTH MAN is out of print, and there's a reason for that: it is nothing but lurid nonsense from start to finish.  And if you find a copy of this book at a garage sale, as I did, you may want to speed the process of its elimination by buying it for a dime in order to have the pleasure of dumping it in the trash.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-06-15

But although he was in some respects a shallow man who lived largely for personal pleasure, he was also a very driven and complex one, a man whose fame on the stage did not come easily and who faced a series of horrific hurdles in his private life.<br /><br />Porter risked his grandfather's ire--and the family fortune he controlled--by settling on a career in music, and while he earned early fame at Yale through his compositions, his first Broadway venture, See America First, was a humiliating fiasco.  Homosexual in an era when it was flatly unacceptable, he would marry to retain respectability and forge a remarkable emotional (if completely platonic) relationship with wife Linda Lee Thomas--even while conducting a series of same-sex affairs that would prove frustratingly superficial.  Near the height of his career, a horseback riding accident would leave him crippled and in physical agony for the rest of his life, and the pressures of pain and keeping up appearances would plunge him into fits of depression that seemed to border on the psychotic.<br /><br />Biographer William McBrien is meticulous in his research and his recreation of Porter's very high society, and in other hands such a weight of knowledge might plunge a book into absolute impenetrability--but although McBrien sometimes errs by flooding the reader with inconsequential detail, by and large he keeps a fine balance on his very difficult subject, tracing the arc of Porter's life from Indiana to Yale to New York to Europe to Hollywood, tracing the arc of his career from the humiliating fiasco of Porter's first Broadway show \\"See America First\\" to the brilliance of such successes as \\"Anything Goes\\" and \\"Kiss Me Kate.\\"<br /><br />In the process McBrien not only seems to capture Porter, but an entire era as well--a world of sharp sophistication when terms like \\"star\\" and \\"toast of two continents\\" and \\"gentlemen\\" still had meaning, when the \\"have-nots\\" danced to the tempo of the \\"haves\\" and the wealthy went slumming for a thrill.

She is most disconcerted to find an enemy solider hiding in her bedroom following a decisive battle--but fancying herself in the role of romantic heroine, she elects to help him escape.  Trouble is, he comes back.<br /><br />This is in some ways among the least of Shaw's work.  Still, the nonesensical situations, witty dialogue, and delicious ironies of the situation make for a memorable package, a package which Shaw ties up in ribbons of ideas about the illusions of romance, the realities of love, and the practicalities of war and peace.  The result is a delightful confection with unexpected depth, and the combination has caused ARMS AND THE MAN to be among Shaw's most often revived works.

No sooner was the club founded than its members embarked on a game of sorts: they would write a murder mystery together.  The result was THE FLOATING ADMIRAL.<br /><br />The Gregg Press edition is the most desirable printing of this hard-to-find novel I have encountered, opening with a 1979 essay by Detection Club member Christianna Brand (author of such novels as GREEN FOR DANGER and DEATH IN HIGH HEELS), who recalls the history of the club and sketches memorable portraits of its members.  This is followed by the original 1932 introduction by Dorothy L. Sayers, in which she describes the process by which the novel was written: each participating author wrote a chapter in turn, remaining consistent with the plot as created in all previous chapters and with a specific and justifiable solution of their own creation in mind.<br /><br />The authors who played this literary game create a roster of the finest English mystery novelists of the early 1930s.  After a prologue by C.K. Chesterson, creator of the famous \\"Father Brown\\" mysteries, there follows chapters by Victor L. Whitechurch; G.D.H. and M. Cole; Henry Wade; Agatha Christie; John Rhodes; Milward Kennedy; Dorothy L. Sayers; Ronald A. Knox; Freeman Wills Crofts; Edgar Jepson; Clemence Dane; and Anthony Berkeley, better known as Anthony Iles.<br /><br />The story itself concerns Inspector Rudge, a rural officer who is called to the scene of a peculiar murder: the body of Admiral Penistone has been found stabbed to the heart and floating in a small boat on the River Whyn.  Not only are the circumstances odd, it soon transpires that there are several people who might have interest in his demise--including his peculiar niece Elma, her possibly undesirable lover, and her missing brother.  But although the premise is something of a classic, the novel largely runs aground due to the scattered approach of the participating writers.<br /><br />This is not to say that any of the authors involved write badly.  It is to say, however, that as the novel progresses each writer has considerably more difficulty in lining up the endless parade of clues offered by those who have gone before to create either a cohesive narrative or a reasonable solution.  So the end result is like buckshot: a story that seems to fly in so many different directions that it has no long-range strike.  Even so, fans of 1930s murder mysteries will prize this novel as a hard-to-find curiosity--and they will be particularly pleased to note that most of the authors involved offered very different solutions to the crime, many of them more interesting than anything in the text itself and all of them collected in a neat appendix.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerund due to the scattered approach of the participating writers.

Postmistress Mary \\"Harry\\" Harristein reigns supreme over the tiny town's equally tiny post office, surrounded by an amusing assortment of friends and acquaintances--not the least of which are her two cats, Mrs. Murphy and Pewter, and her dog, Tucker.  And when Harry stumbles over a dying man while walking along Potlicker Creek, her animals are as curious about the situation as she.<br /><br />Brown has never really bothered to construct a tightly designed plot for any of the Mrs. Murphy novels, and while the motive and means for murder prove particularly ingenious in this novel the story itself is loose even in comparison to previous titles in the series.  Still, it's all in good fun, and longtime fans of the series will be greatly interested to note that with WHISKER OF EVIL Brown begins to alter the course of her characters' lives with a host of changes that come for both good and ill.

Although he also addressed these issues in such other plays as PYGMALION and MAN AND SUPERMAN, CANDIDA is perhaps his clearest statement on the subject.  Written in 1894, it is a statement that has proven timeless.  It is easily among the favorite performance pieces of world theatre.<br /><br />The plot is quite simple.  The Rev. Morrell is a minister with a taste for reform--and he has had the good fortune to marry the perfect wife, a remarkable woman named Candida who has a talent for smoothing every path she encounters.  One of the paths to which she has turned that talent is that of Marchbanks, a poetic young man who is the grip of all the emotional turmoil delayed adolescence implies.  But Marchbanks has fallen in love with Candida, and when he informs her husband of this all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Throughout much of the play Morrell and Marchbanks engage in a series of brilliantly written duels over Candida, each of them espousing what Candida means to them and what they can give her, arguing through numerous philosophical issues in the process.  But neither gentleman has actually troubled to consult Candida herself; when they eventually lay the issue before her and insist that she decide between them, she responds in a way that not only demonstrates how little they know of her, but how little they know about both women and the world in general.<br /><br />The climax of the play has been dropping jaws in theatres for well over a hundred years and it seems likely that it will do so for at least a hundred more--and although Shaw presents his play as a comedy, it will be the rare husband who leaves it without a quick glance at his wife and the disturbed thought that like Candida, she may not be entirely what he has always believed her to be.  Brilliantly written and reading as well on the page as it plays on the stage, CANDIDA is easily among the great plays of this or any other era; a personal favorite and very strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewern and reading as well on the page as it plays on the stage, CANDIDA is easily among the great plays of this or any other era; a personal favorite and very strongly recommended.

Even after this delay, moralists denounced it as a scandalous play--and it remained controversial well into the mid-20th Century.<br /><br />The basic story concerns a pragmatic young woman, Vivie, who has spent her life in boarding schools, seeing her mother only on rare occasions.  Upon graduation, she now directly confronts her mother and learns the bitter truth: Mrs. Warren is a former prostitute who has risen to the rank of a high class madam, and all of Vivie's education has been built on the profits of her profession.  But the play takes an unexpected twist, for instead of sensationalizing or sentimentalizing prostitution, Shaw gives us Mrs. Warren as a business woman who took the only opportunity available to her and through commonsense and a strong work ethic parlayed her meager beginnings into a fortune of note.<br /><br />The obvious reason for public outcry against the play was Shaw's refusal to condemn Mrs. Warren for prostitution; less obvious but more powerful is the fact that Shaw condemns virtually every character and the society in which they move as grossly hypocritical.  It is an incredibly hypocritical society that has forced Mrs. Warren to decide between the virtue of starvation and the sin of success; while easily the most sympathetic role in the play, Mrs. Warren emerges as a garden-variety hypocrite of limited insight; and while we may admire Vivie for her clarity of thought and apparent virtue, she emerges as a young woman of such ferocious self-determination that she is ultimately difficult to like.<br /><br />MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION was among Shaw's earliest plays, and it pales a bit in comparison to his later, more theatrically sophistocated works; consequently it is seldom revived today.  Even so, it is a powerful example of the new style Shaw would forge in theatre, a dark comedy overflowing with complex ideas and wickedly funny ironies.  Shaw's tone of voice is both distinct and unique, he reads from the page as well as he plays on the stage, and he would exert a profound influence on drama throughout the 20th Century.

Sayer's \\"Lord Peter Wimsey\\" mystery novels--and a novel in which Sayers manages to strike the same balance of literary style and humor that she previously created in the 1926 CLOUDS OF WITNESS.  But also like CLOUDS OF WITNESS, UNNATURAL DEATH is not a murder mystery per se--a fact that may annoy readers in search of a classic \\"whodunit\\" novel.  In this instance, the criminal is a foregone conclusion; it is catching her that poses the problem.<br /><br />That problem proves remarkably convoluted.  Miss Agatha Dawson, an elderly lady of considerable wealth, has died after a long battle with cancer--a reasonable death.  Even so, the doctor in charge of the case feels uneasy; not only did the death benefit Miss Dawson's great-niece considerably, it seemed to him a little premature.  And when Lord Peter Wimsey becomes intrigued, it seems that any individual who could give evidence against the niece suddenly dies!  This poses an unexpected moral issue for Wimsey.  Should he continue to pursue the case--even though his persistence seems to force the killer to kill again or again?<br /><br />While somewhat marred by her occasional tendency toward a patronizing sort of racism, UNNATURAL DEATH is far from the worst of  the worst of Sayer's work--it is not, mercifully, as painfully overworked as the slightly later THE FIVE RED HERRINGS or HAVE HIS CARCASS.  And although it falls a bit short of her masterpieces of the mid-1930s (MURDER MUST ADVERTISE, THE NINE TAILORS, GAUDY NIGHT, and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON, titles that continue to dazzle readers and inspire writers to this day), it not only indicates the style of those works but it holds up very well as a tightly written, fast-paced, and intriguing read.

And it is quite possible that he was indeed all these seemingly contradictory things at various points in his complicated life.<br /><br />But rather than actually explore any of these subjects, Mosely and Higham simply rake up a lot old gossip and let it go at that--and what emerges is not so much a portrait of Cary Grant but the extreme lights in which Hollywood scandal mongers tended to regard him.  This is Cary Grant according gossip columnists, intent upon enticing readers with tabloid accusations instead of  making any actual exploration of the nature of the man behind the movie image.

Brother Timothy and sister Cora are in reduced circumstances.  Nieces Susan and Rosamund have made questionable marriages and are in dire need of money to keep their husbands in line.  And what nephew George has been up to is positively criminal.  All in all, it is a classic Christie set-up--and an instance in which she cleverly uses the readers' expectations against them in the most unexpected way imaginable.<br /><br />Christie is not usually noted for her clever characterizations, but she peoples her novel with a host of memorable characters ranging from the elegant Helen Abernathe to the peculiar Mr. Goby to the dithering Miss Gilchrist, and her turn with celebrated detective Hercule Poriot is among the finest she wrote.  Compulsively readable and with a head-spinning solution, AFTER THE FUNERAL easily ranks with Christie's great murder mystery masterpieces, a meticulously crafted novel in which she invites you into her parlor--and distracts you with tea and crumpets to prevent you from noticing her truly wicked way with a web.

Books	2	29	43	N	N	Pot-Boiler Trash	Erskine Caldwell (1903-1987) was considered a major author in the 1930s; today, however, his name is most often mentioned in derision, for his great claim to fame consists of two novels that are bynames for potboiler trash: TOBACCO ROAD and GOD'S LITTLE ACRE.<br /><br />Read today, it is difficult to imagine how something like GOD'S LITTLE ACRE actually managed to sell over eight million copies.  First published in 1933, it tells the story of what Caldwell's apologists describe as uneducated, impoverished, rural white Southerners during the Great Depression--but which any one else with a grain of sense would more specifically describe as no-count trash.  And then as now, there are a great many Southern farmers who fly into a rage whenever Caldwell's name is mentioned, so thoroughly did he blacken their reputation.<br /><br />The reason the novel sold well is very simple: sex.  And while the sex is tame by today's standards, in 1933 it was pretty hot stuff.  Everybody in the novel is in a state of lust.  Daddy TyTy lusts over his daughter-in-law and yes, even his own daughters.  His sons lust over anything in skirts.  His son-in-law lusts over his sisters-in-law.  And daughter Darling Jill just lusts, plain and simple, and there ain't a-nothin' no one can do about it, honey, that's just the way she is.<br /><br />Most particularly, the family lusts over gold.  TyTy has gotten it into his head that there is gold on his farm, and in consequence he has spent the last fifteen years digging holes in it.  Trouble is, he never bothers to fill the holes back in, so now he doesn't have any land to actually farm.  But not to worry.  A wannabe sheriff (who is, of course, in lust--in this case with Darling Jill) has told him where he can find one of them-there albinos, and TyTy is convinced that albino mojo will lead them to the gold for sure.<br /><br />There is one thing that troubles every one, though, and it's the thought that when they find the gold it might just be on \\"God's little acre\\"--a tiny portion of the farm that TyTy has set aside to provide for the Lord's work.  Everything that comes out of God's little acre goes to the church... not, of course, that any one bothers to farm it.  But not to worry.  Every time TyTy begins to suspect that the gold might be on God's little acre he just up and decides to put God's little acre somewhere else.<br /><br />Throw in gun shots, rattle-trap cars, racism, a mill strike, a rich son with his nose in the air (who is, of course, in lust--in this case with his sister-in-law) and every other distasteful and dehumanizing cliche you can imagine and you have GOD'S LITTLE ACRE.  Now, there have been a number of writers who have turned their talents to such lurid tales with considerable success--William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, and John Steinbeck to name but three.  But don't kid yourself: Caldwell isn't among the great masters, not by a long shot, and you're not going to find him listed among the great authors of this or any other era.  When all is said and done, the absolute best that can be said for GOD'S LITTLE ACRE is that it is fairly short.  Two stars for historical significance as a publishing phenomena, but zero for intrinsic merit.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerof the farm that TyTy has set aside to provide for the Lord's work.

Depending on the church, you might find yourself in a hysterically conservative, wildly liberal, or casually moderate congregation.  Consequently, it is extremely difficult to find one-liners of the \\"You Might Be...\\" variety that will resonate with United Methodists across the board.<br /><br />For myself, as a member of the United Methodist Church I found this small, short book harmless but only mildly amusing at best.  If you actually want an idea of the humor you might encounter at a United Methodist Church, you'd really do better to drop in on a UMC pot-luck dinner.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-05-14

But at the same time the central character, Emma Woodhouse, is a marked departure.  Not only is she a young woman of considerable wealth and social standing, she is, as critics are fond of pointing out, \\"flawed.\\"<br /><br />The nature of Emma's flaw is essentially Austen's observation of the great failing of the upper-class: an assumption that what they think and do is inevitably correct.  And although Emma is quick-witted, generous, and kind, she suffers the effect of this blind arrogance when she comes to believe that she is gifted as a matchmaker and can order the romantic lives of her circle to suit her own liking.  The result is a series of seriocomic entanglements and disasters that touches virtually every one with whom Emma comes into contact.<br /><br />The story requires considerable exposition, and consequently the action is slow to gather; add to this the fact that Emma herself is so overbearing and self-assured that you frequently want to give her a slap.  The result is a novel that many, including Austen fans, will find an uphill read.  Even so, Austen is writing very close to the peak of her powers here, and her amazing talent for observation, subtle irony, and flashing wit endow EMMA with tremendous charm and interest.  In many respects a remarkable novel, but one that I recommend more to determined Austen fans than to casual readers.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-05-14

Still, the novel has other, undeniable charms: a renewed acquaintance with the always entertaining Miss Marple, a memorable cast of characters, and a particularly atmospheric setting.

The novel presents us with the episodic adventures of Mma Ramotswe, a large lady of Botswana brimming with commonsense and self-confidence who--with a little reliance on both Agatha Christie and a mail-order &#34;how to&#34; book--converts her beloved father's legacy into a detective agency and quickly makes a name for herself as one of the most astute investigators in the region.<br /><br />Written in a simple style that evokes African fable, the book is episodic in construction, offering several different tales from Mma Ramotswe's casebook--tales that emphasize the culture in which she moves and the thoughtways of her fellow citizens with remarkable elegance.  Whether it is tracing a missing husband, investigating a fraudulent insurance claim, or coping with a loathsome witchdoctor, Mma Ramotswe is clever, practical, and remarkably human, and the book has a gentle irony-laced humor that is almost certain to please.<br /><br />The character is easily one of the most memorable created for the mystery genre in a great many years and her presentation is nothing short of completely enjoyable; most readers will feel they'd like to fly to drop in for some of her bush tea and commonsense advice.  This is certainly a one-sitting read, the sort of book that you pick up intending to read only a chapter or two and then glance up to find that you've missed your dinner date.  Absolutely charming, strongly recommended, and I'm looking forward to reading more of Mme Ramotswe's adventures in the future!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-04-05

John Morgan Wilson is a journalist, screenwriter, and Edgar-winning author of the Benjamin Justice mystery-novel series.  Together they have created Philip Damon, a bandleader who bears a notable resemblance to co-author Duchin and who finds himself at the center of mystery, murder, and mayhem in 1963 San Francisco: several years earlier Damon's beloved wife Diana was strangled to death in their New York apartment; now Damon has returned to the city where they first met, and as he and his band begin to play Diana's double walks into the room on the arm of one the city's rich and powerful, and murder is not far behind.<br /><br />It sounds interesting, but it isn't.  The plot reads rather like an extremely improbable mixture of Charlie Chan, The Thin Man, and Vertigo with a splash of circa-1963 political correctness thrown in for good measure--and it is rendered with such an excessive degree of period charm that it's a wonder the writers didn't expire from nostalgia overdose.  They are also tiresomely celebrity conscious, working hard to introduce such famous names as Marilyn Monroe, Kim Novak, and Truman Capote on virtually every page and to a remarkably tiresome degree.  Before the novel ends, we've had stolen pearls, mysterious trips to the Chinatown, drag queens, and enough references to various musicians of the era to sink a boat, much less a novel.  Now, all of this might be forgiven--including what I thought was a rather obvious double-edged solution--were it not for the fact that the style is very stiff and the characters are extremely inconsistent, shifting from naughty to nice without seeming provocation.<br /><br />One of the characters in the novel, Charlene, is fond of reading murder mysteries.  Toward the end of the novel she notes that she is presently reading a new Dorothy Sayers mystery novel.  Unfortunately, in 1963 Sayers hadn't published a mystery novel in more than twenty years; indeed, Sayers herself had been dead for six.  This is hardly the first time the authors fiddle dates in the book, but hey, why let plausibility get in the way?  And indeed, this is indicative of the novel as a whole.  Final take: it is readable, but it isn't something you'll read again, it won't make you a fan of the Duchin-Wilson writing team, and there are many much better mystery novels out there--several of Dorothy Sayers' among them.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewernfortunately, in 1963 Sayers hadn't published a mystery novel in more than twenty years; indeed, Sayers herself had been dead for six.

Like many Siamese lovers, Marjorie McCann Collier regards the breed as distinctly unique, and the first third of her manual consists of pointing out this supposed uniqueness through a host of personal antidotes.  There is a certain truth Collier's comments: like all purebred animals, Siamese have a very distinct look, vocal quality, and even a tendency toward certain temperaments.  But with all due respect to both Collier and those who promote the mystique of the breed, Siamese are much more like other cats than they are different from them.<br /><br />All cats share a basic set of needs, and Siamese do not really place any unique demands upon their human caretakers.  If you are looking for a cat-care manual, virtually any well-researched and well written-text will provide you with all you need to know.  On the other hand, if you are interested in showing or breeding Siamese, this text offers only very basic information on show standards, genetics, mating, birthing, and the like; if you have progressed beyond the beginner level in these areas you would do well to select a different text.<br /><br />Throughout the manual Collier writes in a casual, rather chatty style that is always easy to read and often amusing, but which can become a bit cloying at times--and I regretted that she did not include at least a brief survey of the breed's history, which is quite interesting.  Still, the color photography is very nice, both the practical advice and illustrations are straightforward and quite sound, and if you know nothing about cats in general you could do much worse than this particular book.

But around 1933 O'Neill--who struggled against physical ailments, alcoholism, and a host of personal demons--fell silent.<br /><br />Although O'Neill was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936, he would remain silent for some ten years, leaving most to believe he had written himself out, was burned out, that his career was over.  But in spite of tremendous personal issues, O'Neill continued to write in private, and during this period he would generate a string of powerful plays, many of which would not be released for performance until after his death in 1953.  The legendary Long Day's Journey Into Night, closely based on his own family life, was written in the early 1940s.  It was first performed in 1956--some three years after his death--at which time it too won the Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />The play presents the story of the Tyrone family.  James Tyrone is a famous stage actor, now aging; his wife Mary is a delicately beautiful but sadly worn woman named Mary.  Their two sons are studies in contrast: Jamie, in his late 30s, is wild--fond of wine, women, and song--and seen as a bad influence on younger Edmund, who is physically frail but intellectually sharp.  The action takes place at their summer home, and begins in the morning; the family seems happy enough--but clearly there is something we do not know, something working under the surface that gives an unnatural quality to their interaction.<br /><br />Over the four acts and next four hours the morning passes into afternoon, the afternoon into night.  And we will learn the truth: the history of money grubbing, the alcoholism, the drugs, the personal failures, the seemingly endless cycle of self-defeating, self-destructive behavior in which the four are locked beyond hope of redemption.  And as it progresses the play gathers itself into an almost unendurable scream of agony, a scream of truly cosmic proportions.<br /><br />Why, you might ask, would someone wish to read--much less sit through--such a play?  A work so painful that it often becomes difficult to continue reading or to look at the stage?  I myself asked this question when I first encountered it.  Over the years I have done quite a bit of theatre.  In the early 1980s I played the role of Edmund; in the late 1990s I played the role of Jamie.  On both occasions I found the play horrifically painful to perform.  On both occasions I wondered if such a painful play could find an audience in small-town America.  On both occasions Long Day's Journey Into Night sold out and not a person left the theatre before each performance ended.<br /><br />Because, I think, the play taps into something that is universal but which is extremely difficult to express in simple terms.  As O'Neill might say himself, it has a touch of the poet--but of a failed poet.  Somehow, in some unique way, it speaks to the self-knowledge we all have of the hidden dreams that never came true, the little accommodations, the big and small failures that have stung us and changed us and over time made us--for better or worse--the beings that we are.  It has humanity.  It makes us see our own humanity.  It makes us acknowledge the humanity of those around us.<br /><br />Many, myself among them, regard this as O'Neill's finest play--and considering the great power that many of his works have, that is saying a great deal.  It is also in some respects one of his most accessible plays: shorn of the experimentalism to which O'Neill was frequently drawn and beautifully simple, beautifully direct, even those unaccustomed to reading playscripts will find it a rapid and powerful read.  For this reason it is really the only O'Neill script I recommend to casual readers.  And I recommend it very, very strongly indeed.

Today casual readers and playgoers are most likely to know his work through two plays written in the early 1940s: the celebrated The Iceman Cometh and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Long Day's Journey Into Night. But the great bulk of O'Neill's work was done between about 1914 and 1933--and although the power of his later work is undeniable, it was actually his earlier work that led to his 1936 Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />BEYOND THE HORIZON was the first full-length O'Neill drama to reach the stage, opening first as a matinee-only show in February 1920.  Notices were extremely good, and the show quickly moved to a regular-schedule venue, where it enjoyed considerable critical and popular support and became the first of four O'Neill scripts to win the Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />The story concerns two farming brothers. Robert is physically delicate, something of a dreamer, and longs to visit distant lands &#34;beyond the horizon;&#34; Andrew, robust and outgoing, is content to remain on the farm.  When Robert receives the opportunity to take a long ocean voyage that may restore his health, he jumps at the chance--but fate intervenes in the form of Andrew's girlfriend Ruth, whom Robert secretly loves.  Ruth confesses to Robert that she prefers him, and so the brothers switch plans and destinies: Robert will remain on the farm with Ruth; Andrew will go &#34;beyond the horizon.&#34;  But the decision proves costly.  Robert remains unsuited to farm life, his marriage turns sour, and Andrew's return sparks unpleasant personal revelations that lead to tragedy.<br /><br />At the time it debuted, critics applauded O'Neill's power--but they also condemned the play's final act, which seemed miscalculated and overwrought, and which failed to reach the note of grand tragedy for which the play strove.  This criticism remains as valid today as it did in 1920, and read today the play also seems very much of its time and therefore distinctly dated.  It is rarely revived.  Still, for all its flaws, BEYOND THE HORIZON has moments of tremendous power, and when compared with other dramas of the era it is easy to see what all the fuss was about.  It also begins the sure consolidation of the basic theme that O'Neill will mine for much of his career: the belief that each person is his own prisoner, and that the prison can be escaped in but one way.<br /><br />THE EMPEROR JONES reached the stage the same year in November, and of the two it is clearly the more significant play and flatly stunned audiences with its unexpected content and style.  In this instance, the story concerns &#34;Emperor Jones,&#34; an American black man of great physical presence but limited insight.  After enduring repressive racism in his own nation, he makes his way to a remote island, where he bluffs his way to the throne--but instead of benefiting from his own experiences and working to create a just society, he recreates the oppression he himself has known.<br /><br />The play actually begins with Jones facing a rebellion.  Jones has anticipated this: with considerable hidden wealth, he will make his escape through the jungle and leave the island by sea.  But he has miscalculated.  The jungle is strange to him at night, and as he flees his own past rises up in ghostly images before him, leading him to gradually divest himself of all the false grandeur to which he has aspired.  In a very real sense, his dash to freedom becomes a descent into a hell he has made for himself--and with each scene the pursuing drums grow louder, driving him on to destruction.<br /><br />Unlike BEYOND THE HORIZON, THE EMPEROR JONES is frequently revived--but like many O'Neill scripts it is a difficult read.  On the page, O'Neill's construction seems mechanical in a way that it does not when you actually see it, and although O'Neill provides a great deal of descriptive stage direction itis extremely difficult to imagine how the show actually plays out before an audience.  Given the flaws of BEYOND THE HORIZON and the challenges of THE EMPEROR JONES, I do not really recommend them for the casual reader--but for any one interested in O'Neill BEYOND THE HORIZON is an essential--and for any one interested in 20th Century theatre THE EMPEROR JONES is required reading, pure and simple.

Today casual readers and playgoers are most likely to know his work through two plays written in the early 1940s: the celebrated The Iceman Cometh and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Long Day's Journey Into Night. But the great bulk of O'Neill's work was done between about 1914 and 1933--and although the power of his later work is undeniable, it was actually his earlier work that led to his 1936 Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />With an insightful introduction by A.R. Gurney, author of such playscripts as The Dining Room, this reasonably-priced volume presents four of O'Neill's earliest successes, including two Pulitzer Prize winners.  Each of the four is remarkable in its own way, and taken together they offer a memorable overview of the ideas, themes, and theatrical concepts that O'Neill would continue to expand upon throughout the rest of his career.<br /><br />The two &#34;realistic&#34; dramas of the quartet took the Pulitzer Prize: Beyond the Horizon, first staged in 1920, and Anna Christie, first staged in 1921.  But although the plays are realistic in tone, it would be a mistake to consider them realistic in ultimate quality--for it is here that O'Neill begins to grapple with themes of fate, of inevitability that critics would tag as &#34;naturalistic.&#34;<br /><br />Beyond the Horizon offers the tale of two brothers who separate and experience a role reversal of sorts when one marries the love of his life--only to find bitterness, disillusionment, and disappointment.  Anna Christie, a play which is still frequently revived, offers the tale of a young prostitute who attempts her past behind by returning to her father--only to find herself caught up in another but equally harsh fate.  Both plays are extremely powerful and both offer O'Neill's richness of theme and concept and both had extremely positive critical and popular support when they debuted; both, however, are also deeply flawed works with final acts that do not quite manage to bring O'Neill's ideas to a completely satisfactory conclusion.<br /><br />It is really in the two remaining plays that O'Neill first finds complete artistic success, plays which are not in the least realistic and which critics would describe as expressionistic.  Whatever word is used, again O'Neill plays with the same sense of inevitability, the same idea that each person is his own prisoner, a prisoner who can only be released from his cage by death.<br /><br />First staged slightly before Beyond the Horizon in 1920, The Emperor Jones proved extremely startling in form. The play presents the tale of &#34;Emperor&#34; Jones, a black man of great physical power but limited insight who escapes from racially repressive America to an island where he bullies his way to the throne.  But ironically, instead of working to create a society that is less repressive, he merely repeats what he has learned and evolves into an abusive ruler.  When his subjects rebel, he makes a marathon run through the jungle to escape ... only to find his past transgressions rising before him as the pursuing drums draw ever closer.  Like Anna Christie, The Emperor Jones remains one of O'Neill's most frequently staged early works.<br /><br />O'Neill's 1922 The Hairy Ape is only slightly less successful than The Emperor Jones, and again finds O'Neill working concepts of personal inevitability into an expressionistic form; indeed, it is easily the single most expressionistic play of O'Neill's entire output.  It presents the story of Yank, a burly lowbrow stoker who works in the flaming hell of an ocean liner's boiler room.  Proud of his work and of himself, Yank is outraged when he is insulted by a society woman as a &#34;hairy ape&#34;--and goes in search of the newly discovered society that rejects him.  But the instant Yank steps outside his boiler room he falls victim to repeated rejection, and like the Emperor Jones he pays the ultimate price for rattling the bars of his personal prison.  Difficult to cast and extremely hard to stage, for all its power The Hairy Ape is rarely revived today.<br /><br />Although all four plays, flaws and all, are remarkably fine and extremely important in the development of 20th century theatre, I do not normally recommend any O'Neill script to the casual reader.  On the page, his dialogue and constructions have an unnatural quality that makes for difficult reading, and although he is usually very specific in scenic and business description it is often very difficult to imagine how the play performs before an audience.  Consequently, readers without a significant background in theatre are likely to find his works challenging to read--but even so it is a challenge worth the effort, and for any one serious about theatre arts all four of these plays are essentials.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerpersonal prison.

Today casual readers and playgoers are most likely to know his work through two plays written in the early 1940s: the celebrated The Iceman Cometh and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Long Day's Journey Into Night.  But the great bulk of O'Neill's work was done between about 1914 and 1933--and although the power of his later work is undeniable, it was actually his earlier work that led to his 1936 Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />O'Neill's 1920s plays include a host of classics and near-classics such as Anna Christie, The Emperor Jones, Desire Under the Elms, and Strange Interlude, but he reached a new peak in theatre with the 1931 production of Mourning Becomes Electra.  Long fascinated by the power of ancient Greek drama (traces of which show in earlier works), O'Neill based his play on Aeschylus' Orestia.  But while O'Neill borrows both the story and numerous devices from ancient Greek theatre, he is no slave to either plot or style: he transposes the tale to post-Civil War New England, where the ancient tale of incestuous love, revenge, murder, and insanity plays out with a ferocity to rival the original.<br /><br />Mourning Becomes Electra also rivals the original in length: it has a performance time of some six hours.  In the original 1931 Theatre Guild production, which starred Alice Brady and the legendary Alla Nazimova, the first curtain rose at 4:00 pm in the afternoon and with intermissions the play continued until about 11:00 pm.  In spite of the tremendous demand the play made on its audience, it proved a resounding success--and although it is now sometimes played over the course of three nights instead of in a single marathon performance, it continues to be revived with great success to this day.<br /><br />With such a long running time, it need hardly be said the story is complex--but like many O'Neill dramas it is more complex in character, psychology, and emotion than in actual plot.  The Mannon family has dominated their small New England town for several generations and in the process has become tainted by a devotion to perceived duty that actually masks unnatural desires and devotions between members of the family.  The story opens as a duel between mother Christine Mannon and daughter Lavinia: in husband Ezra's absence during the Civil War, Christine has embarked upon a love affair with her husband's cousin.  Motivated by her unnatural emotional bond with her father, unnatural jealousy of her mother, and her need to keep up family appearances, Lavinia attempts to blackmail Christine into ending the affair.  But her blackmail is miscalculated: it precipitates a cycle of confrontation, revenge, murder, and suicide that sprawls in remarkable melodramatic, psychological, and symbolic glory over the course of thirteen acts.<br /><br />This is truly an extraordinary play, and one that should be read (and if at all possible seen) by any one seriously interested in theatre arts.  Even so, I hesitate to recommend it (or any O'Neill script for that matter) to readers who lack a strong background in theatre.  On the printed page, O'Neill's dialogue frequently seems flat and his constructions have an awkward feel--qualities that are not apparent when his works are well performed.  And although O'Neill is usually very specific about stage design and stage business, it is often extremely difficult for the novice to envision what his plays are like when they are actually before an audience.  Consequently, inexperienced playreaders are likely to find his work very challenging indeed.  But in a very real sense, and in spite of these challenges, Mourning Becomes Electra is an experience that should not be missed.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerual plot.

Today casual readers and playgoers are most likely to know his work through two plays written in the early 1940s: the celebrated The Iceman Cometh and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Long Day's Journey Into Night. But the great bulk of O'Neill's work was done between about 1914 and 1933--and although the power of his later work is undeniable, it was actually his earlier work that led to his 1936 Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Often experimental in tone, O'Neill's plays of the 1920s and 1930s repeatedly pushed the envelope of what could be done on the stage in terms of both material and presentation, often reaching into unexpected constructions, symbolism, and psychology to jar the audience into a new perception of the possibilities of theatrical art.  And then in 1928 O'Neill created a play that at the time was considered his &#34;magnum opus.&#34;  That play was STRANGE INTERLUDE.<br /><br />STRANGE INTERLUDE challenged the audience in a host of ways, not the least of which was in length: written in nine acts with a running time of about five hours, the original 1928 production starring Lynn Fontanne began performance at mid-afternoon, paused for a dinner break, and then continued to perform for another two hours more.  The structure was also quite extraordinary: from time to time the on-stage action froze, allowing the various characters in the drama to speak their internal thoughts directly to the audience in a way never previously seen on the stage.<br /><br />The story itself is fairly straightforward.  The beautiful, popular, and enigmatic Nina Leeds is surrounded by men--but the one man she loves dies in tragedy.  Determined to deal the matter &#34;sensibly,&#34; she marries in an effort to forget.  It is a decision she will soon regret.  But like most O'Neill plays, the bare bones of the story offers little idea of what he does with it.  Endowing his drama with an unexpected degree of then-new Freudian theory, O'Neill essentially creates a character who gradually transforms the men around her into a series of archetypical characters: she projects upon them her own needs, transforming them into Father, Husband, Lover, Child.  And as the decades roll by, she will fight an endless battle to force these men into the roles she has assigned.<br /><br />STRANGE INTERLUDE is in many ways an extremely problematic play.  Even at the time it opened, many critics felt that the play was long for the sake of being long rather than from any actual dramatic need to be long.  Quite a few also noted that the sudden pauses that allowed the characters to speak their internal thoughts were awkward--and indeed that the thoughts spoken were seldom as profound as they might have been.  Even so, the sheer unexpectedness of the play and the doors it opened led to tremendous critical and commercial success, and even though it continues to face these criticism it is still revived with considerable success to this day.<br /><br />For all its power, I myself do not class STRANGE INTERLUDE with the truly great Eugene O'Neill dramas--titles like DESIRE UNDER THE ELMS, MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA, LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT, and THE ICEMAN COMETH.  It seems to me it is less important for its art than for the theatrical shackles it threw off; indeed, it is very difficult to imagine 20th Century 'art theatre' without it.  Even so, it is a remarkable thing to read and a still more remarkable thing to see on stage, and while I do not generally recommend O'Neill's works for casual readers, STRANGE INTERLUDE is an essential for any one who is serious about theatre.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerof then-new Freudian theory, O'Neill essentially creates a character who gradually transforms the men around her into a series of archetypical characters: she projects upon them her own needs, transforming them into Father, Husband, Lover, Child.

It may therefore come as shock to realize that O'Neill actually won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936--long before any of these titles were staged, much less published.<br /><br />O'Neill began writing poetry at an early age but soon turned to drama.  By 1916 he began to make a reputation with The Provincetown Players, and in 1917 had several one acts produced by New York City's Playwright's Theatre.  His leap to fame came in 1920 and 1921, when his plays Beyond the Horizon and Anna Christie won back-to-back Pulitzer Prizes.  He would reign on the New York stage as the great American playwright of serious drama throughout the 1920s.<br /><br />But in the early 1930s O'Neill--who struggled against poor health, alcoholism, and a host of private demons--became reclusive and fell silent.  By the time of his 1936 Nobel Prize most critics assumed he had written himself out, burned out, that his career was over.  NINE PLAYS, with an introduction by Joseph Wood Krutch, was first published by Modern Library in 1941--at which time O'Neill had not offered material for either publication or production for close to a decade.  In a very real sense, the public and very likely O'Neill himself considered this volume a &#34;summing up&#34; at the end of a distinguished career.<br /><br />The titles included in NINE PLAYS were selected by O'Neill himself as representative of his work, and in an extremely brief note he indicates that his selection was based both on personal preference and critical response.  The titles collected here are: The Emperor Jones, 1920; The Hairy Ape, 1921; All God's Chillun Got Wings, 1923; Desire Under the Elms, 1924; Marco Millions, 1923-1925; The Great God Brown, 1925; Lazarus Laughed, 1925-1926; Strange Interlude, 1926-1927; and Mourning Becomes Electra, 1929-1931.<br />The selection is interesting in a number of ways.  Although O'Neill first made his reputation with realistic drama, virtually every title included here is &#34;experimental&#34; in some form or fashion.  True enough, critics of the era fell over themselves to describe O'Neill's work with various &#34;isms&#34;--expressionism and naturalism among them--but in a general sense the titles here are intensely theatrical in nature, and they all broke with then-popular notions of what a play ought to be like.<br /><br />The Emperor Jones contains remarkably little dialogue at all.  All God's Chillun Got Wings challenges racial notions through a then-shocking tale of a love between a black man and a white woman--a subject truly taboo at the time.  Desire Under the Elms seems to be realistic in tone, but in terms of visuals it is anything but.  Characters literally put on and take off masks in The Great God Brown and action grinds to a halt while they speak directly to the audience in the lengthy Strange Interlude.  And then there is Mourning Becomes Electra, a mixture of symbolism and melodrama that actually requires three nights to perform.<br /><br />Also interesting is the fact that O'Neill includes two titles that were absolute disasters when they appeared on stage: Marco Millions and Lazarus Laughed, both of which might be described as pageant-like dramas that include choral readings in direct echo of ancient Greek dramatic forms.  Clearly, O'Neill did not intend NINE PLAYS to be a sort of literary &#34;greatest hits&#34;--the very popular Beyond the Horizon, Anna Christie, and Ah! Wilderness are conspicuous by their absence--and at the time this volume was first published considered his more experimental work of more significance.<br /><br />Casual readers will likely find O'Neill a challenge.  On the page, his dialogue has an unnatural quality that doesn't exist in actual performance--but at the same time it is often extremely difficult toenvision how an O'Neill script plays, how it actually lives when it is &#34;on its feet&#34; in front of an audience.  Consequently, I do not really recommend anything by O'Neill to someone who hasn't seen much theatre or who is unaccustomed to reading playscripts.  I think such readers will find it too much of leap to be enjoyable.  But if you are a play reader or playgoer, you will likely find him a very rewarding experience.<br /><br />Fortunately, O'Neill began to write seriously once more in the 1940s, and if anything the power of his final works is even greater than those of his earlier ones, with the posthumous 1956 Pulitzer Prize-winning Long Day's Journey Into Night considered his great masterpiece.  If you are looking for an overall O'Neill collection with scholarly annotations, you would really do better with the exceptional three volume Library of America collection, which covers virtually every play he wrote from 1913 to 1943--but this less expensive volume would serve as an excellent introduction for those who aren't quite ready to make such a serious financial or academic investment.

When he himself began to realize that his own sexuality was at odds with society's dictums he entered two decades of struggle: first a struggle to at least give the appearance of conformity, then a struggle to step beyond the status quo itself.  And BECOMING A MAN is a very powerful testament of that struggle, of the price paid, of the self-destructive behavior that the false conformity of &#34;being in the closet&#34; inevitably produces.<br /><br />It is extremely difficult to read BECOMING A MAN without sharing the sense of fury and bitterness that Monette felt when he contemplates his life, and if ever there were an argument in favor of sexual honesty, this is it: the language, an artful mix of the literary and the hardbitten, is remarkable, and Monette pulls no punches when it comes to detailing the fear that drove him.  Truly, the book deserves every accolade heaped upon it.<br /><br />All the same, it is a remarkably disingenuous memoir. Even as Monette displays a justifiable loathing for the social institutions that buried him alive for some three decades, he tends to disregard a basic point: he was in many ways a remarkably privileged individual who actually fed upon those same institutions, having a host of opportunities that few people--gay or straight--ever have.  It was his own determination to place social advantage above personal integrity that led to his decision to remain in the closet in the first place.<br /><br />True, Monette (who died of AIDS not long after this book was published) was born and came of age in an era that had little tolerance for anything beyond the status quo.  But Monette presents being in the closet as something forced upon him by external forces--and this is not strictly true.  There was a choice, and bitter though it was for him and the many others who made it, being in the closet was actually the path of least resistance at the time.  To pretend that it was otherwise does a tremendous disservice to those of his generation who found the courage to select an even more difficult road of sexual honesty.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerthe path of least resistance at the time.

Still, for all the stir it caused at the time (most newspapers wouldn't review or advertise it and many bookstores refused to carry it), it is more interesting for its history than for itself.<br /><br />The story concerns Jim, an all-American boy from Virginia, who has a sexual encounter with classmate Bob just before Bob graduates from highschool and leaves town &#34;to go to sea.&#34;  This is Jim's first same-sex encounter, and with classic adolescent innocence he concludes that he and Bob are spiritual &#34;twins.&#34;  As soon as he graduates, Jim goes in search of Bob on the assumption that Bob feels the same--and driven by this obsession he too &#34;goes to sea,&#34; and moves from port to port and eventually from relationship to relationship in search of his ever-elusive lost love.<br /><br />In a sense, THE CITY AND THE PILLAR gives us a window on what it must have been like to have been a young gay man in this era; at first Jim has absolutely no frame of reference for his sexuality, and when he begins to discover that men who have sex with men are not uncommon he resists thinking of himself as &#34;one of those.&#34;  But the overwhelming problem with the novel is that Jim is not a greatly interesting person, nor is Bob, nor are any of the people that Jim encounters while he looks for Bob.  It soon becomes difficult to care about Jim, much less about whether or not he will ever find Bob and what will happen if he does.<br /><br />Vidal himself was not greatly happy with the novel as it was published in 1948, and he rewrote it for a 1960s reprint. (The original 1948 version, which has a very different ending and slightly different tone, is no longer widely available.)  But in rewriting the novel, Vidal did not go far enough: the characters are just as tedious in the second version as they were in the first.  While I applaud Vidal for taking on such then-hot subject matter, I can't really praise what he did with it either originally or in the rewrite.  Fortunately, if you feel you must read the novel due to its historical significance, it is fairly short--and that, really, is the best thing I can say for it.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerough: the characters are just as tedious in the second version as they were in the first.

US	51138056	R1Y3JHMEXGFLLQ	0345353145	340762456	Sphere	Books	4	36	44	N	N	Extremely Enjoyable Popcorn	You've got to give it to Michael Crichton: he writes one heck of a page-turner.  Open one of his books with the idea that you'll just read a chapter or two before bedtime and you'll suddenly be bleary-eyed at three in the morning.  And although this particular title, which is somewhat less well known than such Crichton novels as THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN and JURASSIC PARK, it still packs a bestseller wallop.<br /><br />The premise is classic Crichton.  In his younger days, psychologist Norman Johnson was approached by the United States government to write a report on the psychological impact of an encounter with extra-terrestrials--and now, on the basis of his rather flippant recommendations, he finds himself en route to a possible UFO crash sight on the floor of the Pacific ocean.  Once established with his colleges in an underwater habitat, the government team encounters a mysterious space craft that contains a still-more mysterious sphere, and those who come into contact with it undergo an unexpected change.<br /><br />The writing is crisp and clean, the hard science is handled quite skillfully, and Crichton plays out his story at a breathless pace: yes, a page-turner if ever there was one.  Still, it is worth noting that SPHERE displays Crichton's weaknesses as clearly as it does his strengths.  Strictly speaking, Crichton hasn't had an original concept in some thirty years, and just as he rehashed his screenplay for WESTWORLD into the novel JURASSIC PARK, so does he rehash THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN into SPHERE.  The novel also contains both the foundational sexism and ambiguous conclusion so typical of Crichton's work.<br /><br />Ultimately, SPHERE is popcorn: we've all had it before and you can't make a truly satisfying meal of it.  But it is tremendously enjoyable all the same, and where is SPHERE is concerned... well, you'll eat every kernel in the bowl.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-02-20

A host of novels predate it, including Gore Vidal's 1948 THE CITY AND THE PILLAR and Mary Renault's brilliant 1959 THE CHARIOTEER. By the 1960s gay characters began to crack the bestseller lists with considerable regularity, with Gavin Lambert's INSIDE DAISY CLOVER a case in point.  But THE FRONT RUNNER was very much the right book at the right time by the right author--and it would become legendary as the voice of a new generation.<br /><br />The Stonewall Riots, which marked a turning point in the struggle for equal rights, was barely five years old when THE FRONT RUNNER was published, and few people--including many in the gay community--had any serious context for the story Warren offered.  Consequently, Warren took nothing for granted: she created that context through a series of meticulously described backgrounds, something that made the book widely accessible to mainstream readers.  And when THE FRONT RUNNER hit the bookstore it proved a revelation for both homosexual and heterosexuals alike: it flew off the shelves, becoming one of the most critically lauded and widely read novels of its decade.<br /><br />The story concerns Harlan, a college track coach who is rocked out of the closet when three world class athletes land on his doorstep after being expelled for homosexuality from a major university.  One of the three is Billy--and Billy is everything that Harlan has both hungered for and feared: a man with whom Harlan could fall in love.  Although many regard it as love story pure and simple, THE FRONT RUNNER is really a sociopolitical novel.  At the time, there was little balance in public discourse on homosexuality--and as Harlan and his runners attain increasing fame they must also deal with public reaction to their increasingly open sexuality.  Then as now, the price for such openness could be extremely high, and in the spotlight of the track field the price for Harlan and Billy will be beyond reckoning.<br /><br />Some may feel the book is dated.  The 1970s slang is so quaint!  And is it really necessary to point out that gay men actually fall in love, that their relationships involve much more than sex?  Is it really necessary to detail Stonewall?  Do we have to go over the whole ground of being in the closet again?  Surely we can take all that for granted now!  Yes, we can.  But one reason we can is that Patricia Nell Warren put it all on the table in the first place.  The world has changed a great deal since the early 1970s, but even with the advent of AIDS, civil unions, and the controversy over same-sex marriage THE FRONT RUNNER still exerts a powerful influence.  It was and is a remarkable novel, and it will doubtlessly remain so for as long as love and sexuality remain twin victims of reactionary hysteria.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerprice for Harlan and Billy will be beyond reckoning.

And although Wells would go onto a very long and distinguished career that included some one hundred published books, THE TIME MACHINE remains one of his most popular novels to this day.<br /><br />The story has been famous for over one hundred years.  The narrator, identified only as &#34;The Time Traveler,&#34; has created a machine capable of moving through time. He boards the machine and rushes headlong into the future--where he finds himself in the strangely utopian society of the &#34;Eloi.&#34;  But unbeknownst to the time traveler, that society is built on the back of a much darker one, the underground world of the &#34;Morlock,&#34; who supply the Eloi's every need in order to harvest them like cattle.<br /><br />Wells was an extremely didactic writer, a social reformer whose thoughts inform virtually everything he wrote.  In many respects THE TIME MACHINE is the perfect example of this, drawing the reader in through an exciting story that Wells turns into a social parable.  Born under the rigid class system of Victorian England, Wells had quite a lot to say about the benefits and evils of such a social system, and his thoughts on the subject are extremely clear here--as are his thoughts about the then-new theory of natural selection.  The result is an elegant but often fearsome portrait of how class systems and natural selection might combine to create a uniquely horrific civilization.<br /><br />Wells would return to these themes again and again, perhaps most obviously in THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU and THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON--both excellent novels in their own right.  But if you are new to Wells, THE TIME MACHINE is an excellent beginning, for it offers a sampling of his mind in remarkably concise fashion.

The book received considerable attention when first published in 1981, and it continues to receive considerable attention to this day--and justly so, for Russo's examination of the various gay characters created by Hollywood explores not only how such images were created by Hollywood, but how they shaped &#34;straight&#34; America's ideas about homosexuals and often altered the gay community's own self image as well.<br /><br />The position Russo takes and the interpretations he offers are nothing short of fascinating, and THE CELLULOID CLOSET holds up extremely well to re-reading.  Even so, it is essentially an excellent work by an amateur writer.  For all the power of its interpretations and arguments, the text is badly structured, and too often the tone of the prose seems less about the films under consideration than about the personality that considers them.  And there are frequent factual errors in the text, with Russo's comments on the cult favorite The Rocky Horror Show perhaps the most glaring case in point.<br /><br />Although Russo's omnipresent personality tends to undercut his prose at times, it is an engaging personality, and in a certain sense it drives the narrative--and indeed does a great deal to make the book's shifting structure seem more acceptable than it would have otherwise been.  And after a careful re-reading of the text, I have come to the conclusion that the errors involved are best described as &#34;surface&#34; errors; they do not seem to me to undercut the power of Russo's interpretations, arguments, or positions, all of which are extremely well presented and very astute.  Even so, given the book's somewhat problematic nature, I would take issue with those who describe it as &#34;definitive,&#34; which is a rather sweeping word.  I would prefer to describe it as a fascinating analysis of a difficult subject written by a gifted amateur author--who manages to overcome his limitations to present an endlessly fascinating series of interpretations, arguments, and positions.  The book deserves a place on the bookshelf of every one who loves film as much as the writer did, and I recommend it strongly.  But it would be a mistake to take it as an absolute.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerc nature, I would take issue with those who describe it as &#34;definitive,&#34; which is a rather sweeping word.

MOREAU is very well known through several extremely loose film adaptations. Pendrick, a British scientist, is shipwrecked--and by chance finds himself on an isolated island where Dr. Moreau and his assistant Montgomery are engaged in a series of experiments.  They are attempting to transform animals into manlike beings.<br /><br />Wells, a social reformer, was a very didactic writer, and his novels reflect his thoughts and theories about humanity.  Much of Wells writing concerns (either directly or covertly) social class, but while this exists in MOREAU it is less the basic theme than an undercurrent.  At core, the novel concerns the then-newly advanced theory of natural selection--and then works to relate how that theory impacts man's concept of God.  Wells often touched upon this, and in several novels he broaches the thought that if mankind evolved &#34;up&#34; it might just as easily evolve &#34;down,&#34; but nowhere in his work is this line of thought more clearly and specifically seen than here.<br /><br />At times Wells' determination to teach his reader can overwhelm; at times it can become so subtle that it is nothing short of absolutely obscure.  But in THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, Wells achieves a perfect balance of the two extremes, even going so far as to balance the characters in such a way that not even the narrator emerges as entirely sympathetic.  It is a remarkable achievement, and in this sense I consider MOREAU possibly the best of Wells work: the novel is as interesting for the story it tells as it is for still very relevant themes it considers.<br /><br />It is also something of an oddity among Wells work, for while Wells often included elements of horror and savagery in his novels, MOREAU is not so much horrific as it is disturbingly gruesome and occasionally deliberately distasteful.  This is not really a book than you can read and then put away: it lingers in your mind in a most unsettling way.

When frustrated in his efforts to restore himself to visibility, he determines to embark upon a reign of terror that will make him master of the world.  It is worth noting, however, that Wells was very much a social writer and that his novels are inevitably commentaries on various social evils.  Once you scratch the surface of THE INVISIBLE MAN you will find that it is very much a parable of class structure that dominated British life during the Victorian age: there are many \\"invisible men;\\" this particular one, however, is in a very literal situation.<br /><br />And it is the literal situation from which the novel draws most of its power.  Invisibility sounds attractive--but what if you were to actually become so?  How would you cope with the ordinary details of every day life?  Griffin does not cope well at all, and although Wells suggests that his madness have arisen from a number of sources, he also implies that it may arise from the fact of invisibility itself, again twisting the context back into the social criticism on which the novel seems based.<br /><br />First published in 1897, THE INVISIBLE MAN is one of Wells earliest novels, and for all its charms it creaks a bit in terms of plot and structure.  Some may disagree, but to my mind the most effective portion of the novel are the chapters in which Griffin relates his adventures to fellow scientist Kemp--but regardless of its flaws remains extremely influential and it has tremendous dash and style throughout.  Short enough to be read in a single sitting, it is a quick and entertaining read and it is also quite witty in an underhanded, subversive sort of way.  Extremely memorable!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-02-02

James has come a very long way from her 1962 debut novel COVER HER FACE, and her narrative skill has become increasingly powerful as the years have gone by.  A CERTAIN JUSTICE is indeed a showcase for that skill, for her uncanny knack for creating believable characters seemingly out of midair, and for the grace and power of her prose.  And it is extremely easy to become absorbed in the novel: although the paperback edition runs well over four hundred pages, I wolfed it down in less than twenty-four hours.<br /><br />A CERTAIN JUSTICE concerns Venetia Aldridge, a criminal lawyer renowned for her skill at defense.  But for all her professional renown, Venetia is something of a failure in her private life: high tempered, demanding, and determined to hold others to the same high standard for which she strives, she has a well deserved reputation for coldness and unkindness.  Most specifically, she has a need to be in absolute control--and as a result she makes enough enemies both professionally and publicly to fill a telephone directory.  And when she is found dead in her offices there are suspects galore.<br /><br />Throughout the novel James revels in the details of the English court system, painting brilliant portraits of the individuals who move across the surface of the law--and sometimes under it.  And as the novel progresses she draws us deeper and deeper still into their lives, their motivations, their worlds.  It is a brilliant piece of writing.  But it has a problem: the ending stinks.  After having skillfully maneuvered us through this unique world and held our interest through two murders and a host of subplots, James essentially cops out by giving us a solution that her detective, Commander Adam Dalgliesh, cannot have logically reached--it is pure guesswork, and frankly James would have done better to simply leave Venetia's murder unsolved than to saddle the novel with such an uninspired conclusion.<br /><br />One of the novel's several points is that murder cannot always be proven in a court of law and therefore cannot always be punished, and I certainly have no quarrel with that concept.  But the person who &#34;did the deed&#34;--let us say that for all the logic involved, James could have just as easily selected another character and pinned it there.  The final chapter is a tremendous let down, particularly in light of the exceptional work that precedes it.  Four stars for James' impressive narrative style, but you're likely to be disappointed on the final page.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerin a court of law and therefore cannot always be punished, and I certainly have no quarrel with that concept.

BLACK BEAUTY, however, is both valuable as art and valuable for the virtues it teaches: kindness, common sense, and helping those who cannot help themselves.  The book is well written in clean prose.  It does not over reach the &#34;reading child,&#34; nor does it talk down to him.  And although it is touching and occasionally sad, it is not in the least sentimental.<br /><br />The story, of course, is about Black Beauty, a handsome horse who is born and raised in happy circumstances.  But in Victorian England horses were used much as we use cars today: they were things to be bought and sold and then gotten rid of when they were no longer useful.  Black Beauty is first sold to a good home, but as time passes he is sold again and again--and not always to people who treat him kindly or even to those who give him common care.<br /><br />There are adventures aplenty, like a stable fire and a dangerous bridge; there are many memorable characters, like the horse Ginger and the kind cabbie Jerry.  All of them are seen from Black Beauty's point of view, and beautifully, perfectly described.  My mother read this book to me, and as soon as I could I was anxious to read it myself; now, some thirty years later I have stumbled once more upon it.  And I can honestly say that it lives up to my memory: it is a fine book, and one that every parent should place in the hands of their children.

Although the foreword by Ray Bradbury is negligible, the Anthony Bonner translation is a graceful compromise between the 1870 French and modern American English, catching the flavor of the period without burying the reader in pseudo-Victorian turns of phrase.<br /><br />That said, readers who come to LEAGUES from either text, audio, or film adaptations of the novel are likely in for a shock, for the original novel is quite different.  Some basics, however, remain the same: Professor Arronax, his valet Conseil, and harpooner Ned Land are coaxed into assisting the United States in a search for a sea monster said to be terrorizing shipping lanes--but the monster is not flesh and blood.  The three soon find themselves in the hands of the mysterious Captain Nemo, who has created a machine that glides beneath the surface of the ocean: a submarine named Nautilus.<br /><br />But there the similarity ends.  While there are very clear similarities between the novel and the various adaptations it has spawned, the Verne novel is less concerned with story,  characters, and adventures than it is in creating a plausible vision of something that simply did not exist at the time Verne wrote: a fully functional submarine capable of navigating even the most treacherous waters.  Consequently, the bulk of Verne's text is concerned with detailed descriptions of the Nautilus and the sealife it encounters.<br /><br />Many modern readers may find it uphill work, particularly when Professor Arronax determinedly notes the sealife he sees to the point of scientific classification.  But even so, and while it may not reach the level of &#34;great art&#34; literature, LEAGUES is a fascinating novel to read--fascinating as much for itself as for what it tells us about the world of the 1870s and what was believed to be possible.

Almost every one in the community has good reason to dislike Patrick--and when he unexpectedly dies of what seem natural causes following Tasmin's disastrous birthday party tongues soon begin to wag.  Dr. Greenleaf, goaded by the speculation, finds himself becoming an extremely reluctant detective in the matter, repeatedly attempting to silence the gossip but unable to still his own mounting questions.<br /><br />One of my ongoing complaints with Rendell is that I often find it difficult to distinguish one character from another until well into the novel--and to a certain extent that holds true here.  But once the characters come into focus, the story moves at a smart pace, and although Rendell provides several characters with unseen motivations they actually work within the context of the premise she establishes.  While this novel has not changed my opinion of Rendells' work in general, it is nonetheless a fast and entertaining read, one that even those who generally dislike the author's work will likely enjoy.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2004-01-18

Wells had very strong ideas about the advantages and disadvantages of a society built on fixed social classes and endless imperialism--and these ideas would inform virtually everything he wrote over his long and distinguished career.  Even in the handful of science fiction novels for which he is chiefly recalled today, Wells would return to these issues again, combining them with then-emerging scientific concepts to remarkably provocative effect.<br /><br />In some respects THE FIRST MEN ON THE MOON is likely his most accessible novel to modern readers, for it is lighter in tone than such Wells novels as THE TIME MACHINE and THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, and it reads like an exceptionally well-written pulp adventure of the era.  But the underpinnings are the same: class, conquest, and--as in THE WAR OF THE WORLDS--Darwin's controversial theories on natural selection and evolution.<br /><br />In this novel Wells relies significantly on fantasy, presenting us with Professor Cavor, an eccentric (and quite comical) scientist determined to create a substance that is \\"opaque\\" to gravity, what we would today call an antigravity material.  Cavor is interested in the work for the sake of knowledge pure and simple, but bankrupt businessman Bedford realizes the commercial implications and attaches himself to the project--and when the material is perfected the two men create a sphere that launches them to the moon!<br /><br />If this is clearly the stuff of fantasy (Jules Verne sneered at it), what the two men find on the moon is not, or at least was not considered so at the time.  In 1901 little was known about the moon, and many notable scientists thought it might hold life.  Upon their arrival, Cavor and Bedford find an atmosphere of sorts, a host of strange plants, and ultimately an insect-like race of beings that reside inside the moon itself, beings who practice forced evolution upon their own kind in order to create a rigid, hive-like social structure.<br /><br />As the nature of the \\"Selenite\\" society reflects Victorian concepts of fixed social classes taken to a logical and unpleasant extreme, so do the two humans reflect opposing points of sociopolitical view.  Cavor is clearly an instrument of science, less interested in practicalities than in knowledge for its own sake--a point of view that Wells seems to hold in considerable sympathy.  But for all this, Cavor is ineffectual; he must rely on Bedford's smash-and-grab imperialistic temperament to see them through.  As in many Wells novels, the resulting clash of ideology is stalemate: both extremes need each other, but they are incapable of building compromise and neither is able to overcome the other to reach an outcome that will be satisfactory to any one concerned.<br /><br />All of this sounds terribly dry and dusty, but the book itself isn't.  THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON is a remarkably lively novel, a fast-paced quick read that will appeal greatly to most readers as it balances its philosphical questions with great chunks of pulse-pounding adventure.  And even though we know that Wells was off the mark re lunar atmosphere, flora, and fauna, it is easy to suspend our disbelief to enjoy the ride.

Sayers was a scholar, writer, and woman of impeccable morals.  In private life, however, she had a torrid love affair and bore a child out of wedlock.  In her literature, Sayers expressed the schism between these aspects of her personality via the character of Harriet Vane, who makes her first appearance in the Lord Peter series in STRONG POISON as a fallen woman on trial for her life.<br /><br />Published in 1930, the novel opens with Harriet Vane in the dock, listening as the judge presiding over trial sums up against her.  She is a writer of mildly popular mysteries who has had a liaison with Philip Boyes, a rather pretentious author better know to critics than to the public.  Their acrimonious separation is quickly followed by Boyes' death from arsenic--and it seems that Harriet, and Harriet only, had both motive and opportunity.<br /><br />But the judge reckons without juror Miss Climpson, employee of the celebrated Lord Peter Wimsey, who derails what would seem an open and shut case--and gives Lord Peter the opportunity to unravel the crime.  And, not incidentally, to fall in love with the accused.  With an infamous actress of the Victorian age lurking in the background and a sizable inheritance on the line, Wimsey rushes to sort out the mystery and save the woman he loves before the case can be retried.<br /><br />STRONG POISON is not really among Sayer's greatest novels, which combine a unique literary style, memorable characters, and complex plots to remarkable effect.  The opening description of the trial, with its detailed account of the judge's comments, feels excessive; the solution to the crime is tricksy and relies heavily on coincidence; and Harriet Vane stands out less effectively than such supporting characters as Miss Climpson.  Nonetheless, it has its charms, most particularly in Sayers' witty and highly literate style and the continued evolution of the characters she had previously created.<br /><br />Most particularly, STRONG POISON sets the stage for two novels in which Harriet Vane will become one of the most memorable characters in the golden age of the English mystery: GAUDY NIGHT and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON, both of which are regarded as high-water marks in the genre.  Sayers wrote several memorable novels in which Harriet Vane does not appear at all, most notably the famous MURDER MUST ADVERTISE, but her development of the character is a remarkable process to behold, and fans will enjoy watching the process.

Along the way, he also developed a very distinct style, an eye for shadow and light and ambiguity of material that lent his work an edge that was uniquely his own.  Between 1973 and his death in 1989, Robert Mapplethorpe's work would appear in well over 200 one-man and group shows, many of them in highly prestigious museums and galleries, throughout America and Europe.<br /><br />In spite of his considerable acclaim and influence in arts circles, Mapplethorpe remained largely unknown to the public at large--until the very eve of his death in 1988, when the Institute of Contemporary Art of the University of Philadelphia mounted a major overview of his work.  Named \\"The Perfect Moment,\\" the exhibition was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts--and when the exhibit arrived in Washington D.C. it provoked a firestorm of controversy.  Led by such conservatives as Senator Jessie Helms and conservative religious leaders as the Rev. Wildemon, The Perfect Moment was roundly condemned, and the National Endowment for the Arts was attacked for having funded the exhibition in the first place.  Ironically, in consequence of this condemnation, The Perfect Moment would go on to become one of the most seen and most profitable arts exhibitions in the history of the United States.  And Robert Mapplethorpe would become a household word.<br /><br />In some respects Mapplethorpe had always been a controversial artist.  The great bulk of his work consisted of still-life flower studies, portraits, and nudes--but it also included a host of images deemed flatly pornographic, images that showed explicit heterosexual and homosexual behavior and often including sadomasochistic activity, images that were deliberately designed to both shock and titillate.  And indeed, these photographs--many of them dating from more than thirty years ago--still have considerable power.<br /><br />But the power of Mapplethorpe's photography is not mere shock value, and even less is it is titillation.  It is in the very fine line he walks in presenting his work, a balance between dark and light that ultimately reads as a balance between life and death.  His photographs present a world in which sordid, occasionally grotesque material acquires beauty--and in which the beauty of a flower, the beauty of the human form seems captured on the brink of annihilation and becomes all the more beautiful for the sense of its impending fall.  Like some of it, all of it, none of it, one thing is clear: Mapplethorpe had genius, and he was adept at communicating through the power of his images.<br /><br />This is the official catalogue of \\"The Perfect Moment\\" exhibition, featuring essays by Janet Kardon, Ray Larson, David Joselit, and a dedication by Mapplethorpe's longtime friend and rock artist Patti Smith--all of which serve to broaden one's grasp of Mapplethorpe's vision.  But most importantly, the book includes photographs.  The flowers, the faces, the bodies, the still-lifes, and yes, the controversial photographs as well, over seventy in all.  And each, in its own way, is extraordinary.<br /><br />Robert Mapplethorpe is not, perhaps, an artist whose work you would like to give your fundamentalist Great Aunt Edna--unless, of course, you are hoping to drive her into heart failure and inherit her estate.  But he is an artist who looks into both the supreme beauties and the darkest fears of the world... and who tells you in turn that you may look too.

Simple yet multi-layered, elegant yet grotesque, this is the book that shows what King can really do when he sets his mind to it.<br />The story opens with Ben Mears, an author who has come to his childhood home of 'Salem's Lot with the idea of writing a novel about the small town's &quot;haunted house&quot; of note.  As he observes the town, he also becomes a part of it, meeting a young woman who might be more than a passing interest, making new friends and renewing old acquaintances.  But there is something--indefinable.  Something that is slowly going wrong in the town.  And it is connected with the &quot;haunted house&quot; of his childhood memories.<br />King is clearly drawing from several sources for inspiration, most particularly Bram Stoker's DRACULA and Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE, as well as from traditional vampire lore.  But what he does with this story of a vampire infestation in a quiet New England town is completely original, peeling back the lives of the townfolk in layers and then showing their gradual corruption as the plague spreads.<br />'SALEM'S LOT is more subtle than most King novels.  It builds with a deliberate slowness and gradually develops a sense of paranoia--that suddenly explodes into a classic horror that keeps you reading through the night with every light in the house turned on.  And King's style here is extraordinary: everything about the book is very precise with not a word out of place, the plot at once fantastic and disturbingly logical.  There are several Stephen King novels on my bookshelf, and I enjoy them... but this is the one to which I most often return.  If you've never read it, prepare yourself for Stephen King at his best.  If you have read it, it's time to read it again.<br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2003-11-27

Written between 1816 and 1818, this is very much a novel of its era, and both language and ideas about plot are quite different from those of today.  That aside, and unlike such contemporaries as Jane Austen, author Mary Shelly has never been greatly admired for her literary style, which is often awkward.  But perhaps the biggest hurdle is that of our own expectations: while it certainly sent icy chills down the spines of 19th Century readers, FRANKENSTEIN is not a horror novel per se.<br /><br />While Mary Shelly might have been stylistically weak, her story was not.  Nothing like it had been written before, and the concept of a student endowing life upon a humanoid creature cobbled together from charnel house parts was unexpectedly shocking to the reading public.  But even more shocking were the ideas that Shelly brought to the story.  Having created this thing in his own image, what--if anything--does the creator owe it?  And in posing this question, Shelly very deliberately raises her novel to an even more complex level: this is not merely the conflict of man and his creation, but also a questioning of God and his responsibility toward his creation.<br /><br />In some respects, the book is written like the famous philosophical \\"dialogues\\" of the ancient world: a counterpoint of questions and arguments that do battle for the reader's acceptance.  More than anything else, FRANKENSTEIN is a novel of ethics and of ideas about ideas, with Mary Shelly's themes arrayed in multiple layers throughout: God, self, society, science; responsibility to self, to society, to the things we bring to society, to the truth; life, integrity, and death--these are the ideas and issues that predominate the book, and any one expecting a horror novel pure and simple is out of luck.<br />Mary Shelly is a rare example of a writer whose ideas clearly outstrip her literary skill--but whose ideas are so powerful that they transcend her literary limitations and continue to resonate today.  And indeed, as science continues to advance, it could not be otherwise so.  Mary Shelly could not see into the future of DNA research, laboratory-grown tissues, test-tube babies and the like--but between 1816 and 1818 she wrote a book about the ethical dilemmas that swirl around them.  And for all its flaws, FRANKENSTEIN is perhaps even more relevant today than it was over a hundred and fifty years ago.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerl that they transcend her literary limitations and continue to resonate today.

Then, as if on the release of a long-held breath, he suddenly fell--and few have fallen quite so far or landed quite so hard.<br />Arriving in Los Angeles as a refugee from Mexican civil war, Ramon Novarro had the burning ambition, remarkable good looks, and undeniable talent to create a great career, and for a time he succeeded. But he was a conflicted man, torn between his ambitions as an actor and his ambitions as a musician, and struggling between a deep-rooted Catholic faith and a sexual identity that his faith condemned. Perhaps out of uncertainty, perhaps out of fear, and sometimes out of desperation, even at the peak of his power he would be easily influenced, and in the process make one bad choice after another, ultimately precipitating his rapid slide into oblivion.<br />In the end, Ramon Novarro would make one bad choice too many--and it led to his brutal death and a court case that effectively splashed the very thing he had worked hardest to conceal from the public across the headlines of the world. And for all his great films and great performances, for all his stardom and talents, he is today best remembered by the public as the gay has-been-star who was tortured to death by two male prostitutes he invited into his home for sex.<br />Given Navorro's determined privacy, much about the man remains mysterious--but Andre Soares' BEYOND PARADISE seems to capture an essence of the man that far exceeds any other account offered thus far, giving us not the stuff of supermarket tabloids but the complexity of a human being who is by turns likable and unlikable, both an incredible success and a dismal failure. In the process of examining Novarro's life, Soares also creates a memorable portrait of the world in which he moved, the great stars of the era, and the great failures of the studio system in handling Novarro himself. It is a remarkable accomplishment.<br />This is a very dark, very bitter look at both fame and its consequences, and at the inability of an incredibly talented man to ride the crest of fame's wave to a safe shore. A remarkable accomplishment, and one that should do much to return the luster to a once famous but now obscure name. Strongly recommended.<br />GFT, Amazon reviewerin handling Novarro himself.

The 1925 silent film version was one of the great special effects landmarks of its day, and the novel has been filmed on at least two other occasions, once in 1960 and once more (for television) in 2002.  And one scarcely need mention such LOST WORLD-influenced efforts as THE LAND UNKNOWN or the book-to-film JURASSIC PARK and its various sequels.  There seems no end in sight.<br />Doyle's original is remarkably straightforward and devoid of the subplots and love-interest introduced in the various film versions.  The story is told from the point of view of a London reporter, Edward Malone, whose beloved spurs him into action when she declares that she could never marry a man who has no taste for high adventure or bold risk.  Malone accordingly begins to cover a scientific scandal: Professor Challenger has returned from South America with outrageous claims of prehistoric life that survives on a plateau in the Amazon.  When Challenger suggests a party be formed to verify his claims, Malone jumps at the chance.<br />It is interesting to read Doyle's LOST WORLD in comparison with Wells' WAR OF THE WORLDS, for the two novels counterpoint each other terms of mindset; where Wells' famous novel is a covert satire of the brutality of English imperialism, Doyle accepts English imperialism with a manly embrace and sends his explorers off into the uncivilized wilds, where they repeatedly encounter undesirables in great need of a blast from an English-made rifle.  Indeed, they often seem more interested in eradicating newly discovered life forms than in observing them!<br />But we would do a disservice to both Doyle and his novel by taking it too seriously.  It was written to be a blood and thunder adventure, pitting &quot;modern&quot; men against nature's bloody claw--and while Doyle's style here will likely seem a bit stilted to modern readers, the book still works extremely well.  According to lore, Doyle preferred Dr. Challenger to his more celebrated Sherlock Holmes, and indeed Doyle wrote several novels that featured the gruff, blustery, and violent-tempered scientist.  While it seems unlikely that Challenger will ever depose Holmes in the public favor, fans of the Holmes stories will likely enjoy THE LOST WORLD as an example of Doyle's non-mystery work--and certainly fans of early pulp adventure will have a field day.

One of the most popular characters of his short story work was known as &#34;the Continental Op&#34;--an insurance detective (&#34;Op&#34; being short for &#34;operative&#34;) whose various adventures would ultimately form the basis for this, Hammett's second novel-length effort.<br /><br />Although some will disagree, I personally consider THE DAIN CURSE an noticeable improvement over Hammett's first novel, RED HARVEST.  Like most of Hammett's work, both works are noteable for their hard-hitting prose, both offer convoluted plots, and both provide us with archetypical characterizations--but where I find RED HARVEST a strangely flat and slightly up-hill read, THE DAIN CURSE hooks you with the first few pages and holds your attention with ease throughout the entire course of the novel.<br /><br />The story is, as previously stated, convoluted.  The Op is called in to investigate stolen diamonds--but strangely enough, these diamonds are not really precious: they are imperfect stones loaned by a jeweler to scientist/artist Leggett, who experiments with them in an effort to improve their quality.  Leggett seems as surprised as everyone that any one would actually go to the trouble of stealing them--but suddenly the tone of the characters shift, and those who first welcomed the investigation seem to resist it while those who originally opposed it seem to encourage it.  Clearly, there is something more going on than a simple burglary, and it short order it becomes clear that the &#34;something&#34; is murder.<br /><br />While THE DAIN CURSE is an entertaining read, it does have its flaws--and they are flaws that Hammett would take some pains to correct in his future work.  Given that the novel is largely based on various short stories Hammett had previously written, it is hardly surprising that the movement of the plot has an episodic feel; there are actually points in the book where you feel the story has ended long before you've run out of pages, only to have Hammett spin off the plot into an unexpected direction with a somewhat awkward joining of the elements involved.  The characters also tend to be inconsistent, and while this actually forms part of the plotline, Hammett does not entirely succeed in carrying off the effect.<br /><br />Perhaps the single most oft-leveled accusation against the novel is that its heroine proves a largely unsympathetic character who lacks either the power of THE MALTESE FALCON'S perfidious Bridgett or the snap and spark of THE THIN MAN'S Nora.  For myself, I did not find this the major flaw that so many others do; what is an issue, however, is the very limited attention Hammett offers the character in the first third of the novel, where she reads as a minor supporting character--and rather than build the role in a way that places her front and center, Hammett simply shifts gears and suddenly puts her at the forefront.  The result is an extremely awkward transition that undercuts one's suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />But whatever its flaws, THE DAIN CURSE is a truly entertaining read, written in the developing Hammett style that would peak with THE MALTESE FALCON.  It may in some respects be a &#34;developmental&#34; work, but it is no less the worse for that, easily outclassing the vast majority of Hammett imitators that sprang up as the author rose to fame.

Although Carr published a few earlier novels, in 1933 he struck gold with HAG'S NOOK, in which he introduced Dr. Gideon Fell--a character who would rival both Hercule Poroit and Lord Peter Wimsey in popularity for more than a decade.<br /><br />Like many Carr novels, HAG'S NOOK is tinged with elements of the supernatural.  The novel presents us with the Starberth family, whose family fortune was built several centuries earlier on ownership of a English prison--a prison so brutally managed that the family is said to be cursed.  And inheritance of the fortune is dependent upon a strange requirement: on the night of his twenty-fifth birthday, the heir must spend a full hour alone in the office of the now abandoned prison, which is widely rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of the many who died there.  The prospect daunts Martin Starberth, the current heir--and his anxiety fuels the anxiety of his sister Dorothy, the young American visitor Tad Rampole, and Rampole's host Dr. Gideon Fell.  And indeed, they have good reason to be anxious, for the hour's vigil brings unexpected death.<br /><br />In reading HAG'S NOOK, I understand why Carr is considerably less well known today than many of his contemporaries.  The plot is pure slight-of-hand, a variation on the &#34;locked room&#34; mystery that attracted so many writers in the 1920s and 1930s.  It reads as &#34;tricksy&#34; in an old-fashioned sort of way, and I found myself unable to work up much enthusiasm for it.  On the other hand, Carr proves himself an extremely atmospheric writer, able to capture both setting and character in remarkably graceful prose, and he leaves you feeling that if indeed such an unlikely series of events could really happen... they would happen precisely like this.<br /><br />I would not really recommend HAG'S NOOK to readers who are only casually interested in the mystery genre, for they are likely to be more than a little dissatisfied.  But if you enjoy tracing the roots of the modern mystery, reading Carr is a must--and I give HAG'S NOOK four stars on style alone.<br /><br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--y casually interested in the mystery genre, for they are likely to be more than a little dissatisfied.

For while HARVEST OF BONES isn't actually downright bad, it isn't a very believable--nor is it particularly memorable.  Indeed, only two days after I finished reading it, I have considerable difficulty recalling the names of the major characters, much less the convolutions of the plot.<br /><br />And convoluted it is indeed.  Fay Hubbard, a 50-something woman, has left her husband and come to rural Vermont to run a B&B--but her first guest proves to be the property's former owner, an elderly and eccentric woman who has escaped from her retirement home with the aid of a younger but equally eccentric niece.  And when a decaying skeleton is unearthed on the family farm... well, it just might be the old lady's long-missing husband.  Then again, it might have something to do with that mysterious women's retreat down the road.  Or the long-ago suicide of the local lady-killer.  Or the mean old man who spies on the women's retreat.  You just never know.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Wright presents us with a number of less-than-likable male characters and then counters them with a host of women who have been made unhappy by men--most often through bad marriages, but with the occasional bout of spousal abuse, kidnapping, and rape thrown in for emphasis.  In the hands of another writer, this might actually add up to an interesting statement, but since Wright's characters are more akin to a Saturday morning cartoon than reality, it ultimately reads like the writer is having a personal snit.  And when all is said and done, none of it really has much to do with the story itself.<br /><br />All in all, Wright reads rather like a wannabe Rita Mae Brown without any sense of humor.  Yes, you can get through it, and yes, it is actually painless so to do.  But there's much better stuff out there, so give HARVEST OF BONES a miss.<br /><br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--	2003-08-28

Originally written in the 1950s and later updated in the early 1970s, GOODNESS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT is the autobiography of the celebrated Mae West, one of the 20th century's greatest stars of stage and screen.  It is an entertaining read, and in her writings West perfectly captures that unique tone and way with words that made her world famous.<br /><br />But whether she intended it to be so or not, the most interesting thing about the autobiography is its revelation of the incredible ego that drove her.  To hear her tell it, West was born with absolute self-awareness, knew what she wanted from the cradle, and was well on her way to getting it before she could walk.  Be it saving the life of a drowning child, doing a lion-taming act, or living out the life of sex goddess to end all sex goddesses, Mae West did it first--and if not first, at least better.  And if either of those are a matter of opinion, there is clearly only one opinion that counts with West: hers.<br /><br />Sometimes she is factually inaccurate, as in her assesment of the box office success of MY LITTLE CHICKADEE (it was not a big hit at the time.)  Sometimes she simply ignores an unpleasant fact or two, as when she declares that her film work ended because no one could offer her a good script (in truth, her screen career ended because public taste had changed and her films simply weren't living up to box office expectations any more.)  But the truly astonishing thing about her various claims is how often they really are correct: yes, she really did save Paramount from bankruptcy; yes, she really was the highest-paid star in 1930s Hollywood; yes, her stage work was every bit as legendary as she says it was.<br /><br />If West's autobiography often comes off as boastful, it has reason to be so; even so, the tone of unending self-praise does have a way of wearing a bit thin after a while, and now and then a little humility would not have been amiss.

But like her earliest works of the 1920s, her later works of the 1960s are negelected.  And in the case of ENDLESS NIGHT this is an oversight indeed.<br /><br />ENDLESS NIGHT presents us with Mike, a restless young man who has drifted from job to job without seeming to find any true satisfaction--and a young man who is fascinated by \\"Gipsy's Acre,\\" a plot of land in rural England said to be cursed by the Gipsies who once lived there and who were driven away.  While walking the property, which has come up for sale, he meets an attractive young American woman, and a whirlwind courtship ensues.  It is not until well into the relationship that the woman, Ellie, discloses that she is rich.  And not just rich: she is the heiress to a fabulous fortune.<br /><br />The two marry and hire a noted architect to construct the perfect home on Gipsy's Acre--but no sooner are they installed then the property's legendary curse begins to unfold.  A local gipsy woman warns them of bad luck; rocks are flung through windows; a bird is found pinned to the front door with a dagger.  And they are surrounded by Ellie's relatives and business relations, all of whom seem to have hidden agendas and none of whom like the fact that Ellie has been torn from their control.<br /><br />Many Christie novels can be read in a single sitting, but ENDLESS NIGHT has an unusually slow build--and Christie defies her detractors, who often accused her of purely mechanical construction, by creating an atmosphere that collects into deepest darkness before the novel's startling conclusion. As she often did, Christie lifts a plot twist from a previous novel for this later tale, and those who have read her more famous books may spot the trick; even so, this is not a copy of an earlier work, for the device upon which the inevitable crime hangs is used in a remarkably different way, and instead of the neatly drawn crime-detection-solution path of most of her works, ENDLESS NIGHT is a multiple character study that gradually descends into a Hitchcockian horror.

Wells is chiefly recalled by the general public as the author of three seminal science-fiction novels: THE TIME MACHINE, THE INVISIBLE MAN, and most famously THE WAR OF THE WORLDS.  But these are only three of the more than one hundred books Wells published in his lifetime, and it is worth recalling that Wells himself was a socio-political and very didactic writer, a determined reformer with distinctly socialist leanings.  And his point of view informs everything he wrote--including these three famous novels.<br /><br />In each case, Wells uses the trappings of science-fiction and popular literature to lure readers into what is essentially a moral lesson.  THE TIME MACHINE is essentially a statement on the evils of the English class system.  THE INVISIBLE MAN addresses the predicaments of the men and women to whom society turns a blind eye.  And THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a truly savage commentary on British imperialism and colonialism.<br /><br />This is not to say that it isn't science-fiction--for it most certainly is, and moreover it is science-fiction well grounded in the scientific thinking of its day: intelligent life on Mars was believed to be entirely possible, and Wells forecasts the machinery and weapons that would soon become all too real in World War I.  Set in England about the beginning of the 20th Century, the story finds a strange meteor landing near the narrator's home--and from it emerge Martians, who promptly construct gigantic and powerful killing machines and set about wiping the human population of England off the face of the earth.  The Martians and their machines are exceptionally well imagined, the story moves at a fast clip, and the writing is strong, concise, and powerful.  And to say the book has had tremendous influence is an understatement: we have been deluged with tales of alien invaders (although not necessarily from Mars) ever since.<br /><br />But there is a great deal more going on here than just an entertaining story.  Both the England and Europe of 1898 were imperialistic powers, beating less technologically advanced cultures into submission, colonizing them, and then draining them of their resources.  With THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, Wells turns the tables, and imperialistic England finds itself facing the same sort of social, economic, and cultural extermination it has repeatedly visited on others.<br /><br />The upshot of the whole thing is that Wells ultimately paints the English habit of forced colonization as akin to an invasion by horrific blood-sucking monsters from outer space--and even goes so far as to suggest that if the present trend continues we ourselves may follow an evolutionary path that will bring us to the same level as the Martians: ugly, sluggish creatures that rely on machines and simply drain off what they need from others without any great concern for the consequences.  If we find the idea of such creatures horrific, he warns, we'd best look to our own habits.  For these monsters are more like us than we may first suppose.<br /><br />And this, really, is why the novel has survived even in the face of advancing scientific knowledge that renders the idea of an invasion from Mars more than a little foolish.  THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a mirror, and even more than a century later the Martians reflect our own nature to a truly uncomfortable degree.  A memorable novel, and strongly recommended--at least to those who have the sense to understand the parable it offers.<br /><br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--Both the England and Europe of 1898 were imperialistic powers, beating less technologically advanced cultures into submission, colonizing them, and then draining them of their resources.

Instead, it is best regarded as something of a cultural curiosity.<br /><br />The English of Christie's age and background tended to have an 'Empire' mentality, and a sense of national and racial superiority was often the result--and it is seen in the works of many English mystery writers of the 1920s and 1930s.  (Dorothy Sayers is particularly notable for a patronizing anti-Semitism.)  Unlike some of her contemporaries, Christie would eventually outgrow the mindset--but CHIMNEYS shows her at her most xenophobic, taking swipes at unpolished colonials, Jews, and those troublesome little Balkan states, to name but a few.<br /><br />That said, the plot centers on a monarchy's possible return to power in one of the aforesaid Balkan states--and it offers us everything but the kitchen sink.  There are mysterious memoirs, scandalous letters, blackmail, missing jewels, secret passages, a body in a trunk, and gunshots at night.  Ultimately, the novel reads like the basis for a Marx Brothers movie that every one thought better of.<br /><br />But it does have one or two charms, and the primary one is a handful of entertaining characters that stand out against the otherwise cardboardish creations that people the novel: the spirited and charming Virginia Revel, the eternally anxious Lord Caterham, and Caterham's &#34;bright young thing&#34; daughter 'Bundle.'  And the absurd plot itself has its own odd sort of fascination: you can't help wondering what silly thing Christie will throw at you next.<br /><br />This is really a book more for established fans who will be interested in the writer's earlier and more obscure titles.  But for newcomers interested in the same period, I would recommend THE SECRET ADVERSARY, which offers the same convoluted and often ridiculous plot but does so with tremendous humor, spirit, and more memorable characters.<br /><br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--r)--	2003-07-20

He is the subject of many clever stories which are as well-known for their brevity as for their wit.<br />THE TALES OF NASREDDIN HODJA is not a book.  It is instead a stack of 40 cards.  The back of each card presents a simple logo; the front offers an illustration and a Nasreddin Hodja story, some as short as a single paragraph, some as long as several short paragraphs.  While the stories are very entertaining in and of themselves, the purpose of the set is to enhance language skills, most particularly so for those learning English as a second language.  The set of cards comes with a short introduction re Nasreddin Hodja and a number of suggestions as to how the cards might be used.<br />While the cards seem perfectly suited to teaching language skills, I have never used them as such.  Instead, I use them as as an &quot;ice breaker&quot; in discussion groups.  They are particularly effective in situations where few members of the group know each other and the group meets several times over a period of several days.  At the beginning of the session, I have one, two, or more participants draw a card and then read it aloud to the group; the stories are funny, thoughtful, and tend to provoke commentary that can then be redirected to the subject at hand.<br />Although I recommend them--and suspect that imaginative teachers and discussion leaders could find many ways in which to use them--I'm deducting a star from the rating due to the flimsy nature of the cards themselves: they are not printed on a card stock, but on paper of fairly light weight.  Because of this the cards are easily torn, bent, crumpled.  If you find you use them frequently, you may want to protect them with plastic sleeves.<br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--	2003-07-18

But with CLOUDS OF WITNESS she found a very neat balance--and the result is not only the first clear sounding of Sayers' literary voice, it is also simply the best of her early works.<br />In this particular story, death unexpectedly arrives in the very bosom of the Wimsey family: the Duke has taken a rural manor for the hunting season, and when his sister's fiance is found shot to death in the small hours of the morning he is himself accused.  Curiously, he declines to offer any sort of alibi--but fortunately there is a sleuth in the family: Lord Peter Wimsey, who arrives post-haste to sort the matter out.<br />While the novel's conclusion may frustrate many readers, this is a fast, fun read with engaging characters and an emerging and very sophisticated literary style--the style on which Sayers would ultimately establish such later and landmark works as MURDER MUST ADVERTISE, GAUDY NIGHT, and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON.  Established fans will likely enjoy it more than first-timers, but if you've not yet encountered Sayers don't let that stop you: it's an elegant work.

US	51138056	RLJQQ9PFVR3A8	0743459075	963501665	Psycho	Books	2	27	50	N	N	Third Rate Pulp Trash	My recently-purchased copy of Robert Bloch's PSYCHO features a cover photograph of Janet Leigh screaming and a quote from film director Alfred Hitchcock: \\"PSYCHO all came from Robert Bloch's novel.\\"  Not surprisingly, however, no mention is made of the fact that Hitchcock considered the novel third-rate pulp trash.<br /><br />And that, unfortunately, is exactly what this novel is.  First published in 1959, the Bloch novel is everything you would expect from a bad 1950s pulp writer: it is lurid without being shocking, the characters are superficial, and the whole thing is somewhat less frightening than a baloney sandwich.  True, the story and characters that Hitchcock would so successfully elaborate upon are all here--but if you're expecting something more in-depth than the film you are out of luck.  The famous shower scene is all of four short paragraphs; the murder on the stairs gets even less attention; and it isn't until the final chapters that the novel builds up any steam at all.<br /><br />The problem isn't so much the story--certainly Hitchcock's version proves that much--as it is Bloch's style.  Or, more specifically, Bloch's lack of it, for he has none.  And his characters are even less interesting than his prose, so it should come as no surprise that Hitchcock did not invite Bloch to work on the film.  It is a bit unusual to find a film that equals the book on which it is based; it is rarer still to find a film that bests it.  But that is precisely the case here, and quite frankly the spill-over audience from the film is probably the only reason this novel remains in print.  Diehard fans of the film like myself can probably motivate themselves to read it through to the end, but even I regretted the time wasted on it.  Give it a miss.<br /><br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--	2003-07-04

In fact, it is nothing of the kind; it is instead a tale of the emotional tension and legal maneuvering that occurs in the wake of a highly publicized false accusation.<br /><br />Elderly Mrs. Sharpe and her highly individualistic daughter Marion reside on the outskirts of a rural English community in a decaying mansion known as Franchise. Although considered eccentric by locals, they are tolerated--until an attractive schoolgirl named Betty Kane claims that she was kidnapped, beaten, and held prisoner by the Sharpes for a month.  Betty Kane's story is convincing enough to draw both the interest of Scotland Yard and the national press, but Sharpe's solicitor recognizes her for what she is: a vicious creature eager to conceal her real activities from her unsuspecting family. And even as the press comes down hard on the side of the girl and the locals turn on the Sharpes, he sets out to expose Betty Kane before the world for the liar she is.<br /><br />The story itself is extremely credible, the characters remarkably well drawn, and Tey writes in a very elegant style that offers enough detail to perfectly capture the story, characters, and locales without overplaying into excess.

Her detective, reporter James Qwilleran, investigates crimes with the aid of his Siamese cats--and the solutions to the crime rest more upon intuition than actual deduction. While the premise sounds farfetched, Braun's work is usually less fanciful than you might expect, and she presents her eccentric characters and stories with great charm.<br />But with THE CAT WHO WENT UP THE CREEK, it becomes evident that Braun has finally written one &quot;Cat Who...&quot; novel too many--if indeed she wrote this one at all.  In some ways, the book seems typical of Braun, for it holds close to the formula she has established: Qwilleran is invited to visit the Nutcracker Inn in the Black Creek community, and between coping with his cats, running into old friends, and engaging in community gossip, he becomes aware of mysterious doings re the nearby &quot;Black Forrest&quot; land conservancy.  But for all that, the novel simply doesn't read like Braun.  Braun typically has an even pace and tone; she endows her eccentric characters and their episodic adventures with tremendous charm; and although her plots are extremely light she inevitably brings them to a clear resolution.  But none of that happens here.  The first and final thirds of the book have an extremely awkward feel, the characters and events seem perfunctory, and while there is a resolution of sorts it completely lacks the tone one expects of her work.<br />Judging from this, I would say that THE CAT WHO WENT UP THE CREEK was created by Braun in the sense that she developed the plot and outlined the highlights--but unless I'm truly off the mark, I'd have to opinion that the execution of this novel was either completely ghosted or significantly assisted by someone familiar with Braun's work but unable to duplicate the nuances of her style.

And A NEW LEASE OF DEATH is rather typical of her work: there is little in the way of plot, and what plot there is is repeatedly swamped by Rendell's determination to expose the psychology of her characters--psychology which is often far-fetched and which seldom has anything to do with anything else in the book.<br />As the novel begins, Chief Inspector Wexford recalls his first murder case: the ax murder of an elderly woman.  Fortunately for the then-inexperienced Wexford, the case was remarkably straight-forward; the woman's handyman was obviously guilty.  But now, some fifteen years later, a Vicar named Archery has requested an interview with Wexford about the case, and when he arrives he wants to know if there was even a remote possibility that the man convicted was innocent after all.  When Wexford negates the idea, Archery sets off on his own to interview the various people connected with the case, hoping to prove Wexford wrong.<br />The premise is much more interesting than the novel itself.  The book opens with no less than two full chapters of exposition--and then Rendell's oddities take over, knocking herself out to expose the psychology of her characters, whether such has any bearing on the story or not.  As for the mystery itself... Rendell writes and presents the story exactly as if she were creating a murder mystery, but there is no mystery, none at all, just a series of revelations that arise through pure coincidence and lead every one to some very obvious conclusions about everything from the crime itself to the way in which their lives have been affected by it.<br />There are a great many people who admire Rendell's novels, but while I recognize her stylistic skills I find her chiefly memorable as a mystery novelist whose novels either have a foregone conclusion or no conclusion at all.

At the time of the purchase, Rawlings was a failed novelist in a bad marriage, and both farm house and grove were neglected.  A decade later she was a respected writer on the eve of her most popular novel and happily divorced, and the farm and its citrus groves were very much going concerns.<br />Rawlings would eventually remarry, and both her second marriage and her literary success would gradually lead her away from both her farm and the Cross Creek community--but she would never leave them entirely, always returning for the inspiration that fed her best works.  The property was still in her possession and still in use as both a citrus grove and occasional residence at the time of her sudden death of cerebral hemorrhage in 1953. Rawlings left the it to the University of Florida, and in 1970 the property was turned over to the State of Florida for restoration and management.  Restoration was completed in 1996, and while the large citrus grove that once surrounded the farm house has been reduced to a representative portion, visitors can now see the property as it existed in the 1930s and 1940s.<br />Although Rawlings won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel THE YEARLING and would publish several other novels and short story collections, today her literary reputation rests largely on the book CROSS CREEK, in which she details both her own struggle on the land the lives of the community as she knew it during the 1930s.  While the book is clearly autobiographical, it is not autobiography per se; she gives little attention to her personal history, preferring to focus instead on the landscape and the individuals that surround her.  The stories she offers are by turns funny, sad, thoughtful, each informed by an intensely felt observation of her environment.  And while critics may accuse her of having been excessively sentimental in her fiction, no such sentimentality besets this particular work.  It is brilliant from start to finish.<br />CROSS CREEK was published in 1942, and while it is very much of its era in its depiction of rural society and racial considerations, it also proved very much ahead of its time. It is profoundly concerned with ecology long before the term was popularized, and not only are its characters vividly alive, they move against a landscape that is as alive as they, a landscape that at once harsh and nurturing, at once giving and indifferent, and throughout the text (and most particularly in its final chapter) Rawlings repeatedly takes the point of view that we are not the owners of the earth, but its trustees; its care is in our hands.<br />I have read CROSS CREEK several times, and I returned to it in the wake of a visit to the Rawlings farm in 2003--and while it is not necessary to actually visit Cross Creek in order to fall in love with this book, they each inform the other.  The book is somewhat obscure; the community of Cross Creek is difficult to find on the map and awkward to reach, hardly a place you would stumble upon by accident.  It must be reached in deliberation.

A year previously London beauty Rosemary Barton unexpectedly dropped dead at dinner in an exclusive London restaurant--and when cyanide was found in both her champagne glass and in her evening bag, her death is ruled a suicide. But with the passage of time her surviving husband becomes suspicious and determines to restage the dinner party with an eye toward uncovering the truth. The result is yet another death--and once more cyanide is in the champagne glass.<br />As in many of her novels, Christie carefully limits the field of suspects to those actually at the table, and it soon transpires that virtually every one present had a motive for Rosemary's murder--and would have a motive to kill again. Is it Rosemary's sister Iris, who inherited a fortune upon her older sister's death? Rosemary's illicit lover, whose career could be ruined by scandal? Or perhaps his wife, who might have killed to save her marriage? Or is there a darker criminal element at work?<br />Although this novel reached the screen with David Suchet playing Hercule Poriot, fans of Suchet's performances should not be misled: Poriot does not appear in this particular novel, and the detective of note is Col. Race, who pursues the killer through an emotional interest in Rosemary's sister Iris. And indeed, this is one of Christie's more romantically-laced tales, with the story hinging on the various romantic and sexual entanglements of the various characters. The writing is solid and unexpectedly moody for a Christie novel, and while a few hardcore Christie fans may be able to spot the killer before the book's conclusion, most readers will be taken considerably by surprise.

Today it pales a bit alongside the truly great Christie novels of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s--but it is still a tremendously entertaining read that will appeal to both new and long-established fans.<br />The novel is cast in a \\"classic English mystery\\" mold: a group of vacationers at an exclusive resort with limited public access fall under suspicion when a beautiful femme fatale is found strangled to death on an isolated beach.  Is the killer a jealous husband, a jealous wife, an unstable step-daughter--or is it connected with the occult, a possible serial killer, an unknown blackmailer, or a member of a drug distribution ring?  The plot complications come tumbling one on top of another, but fortunately for the innocent the island resort is host to a private detective on vacation: the celebrated Hercule Poirot.<br />The novel is particularly memorable for the way in which Christie requires readers to interpret the personality of her characters... and in the process leads you completely astray. Long time fans may recognize the plot device on which the solution rests, for Christie used it earlier in a number of celebrated short stories and would repeat it in a number of later works as well--but to give the Queen of Crime her due, she so neatly works the story that even the most astute reader is unlikely to arrive at the full truth until Poirot deigns to expose it.

The collection does contain three stories that offer Christie at her stylistic and plot-twisting best: \\"The Case of the Perfect Maid,\\" featuring Jane Marple, and \\"Third Floor Flat\\" and \\"The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly,\\" both featuring Hercule Poirot.  Indeed, the first of the three is as fine as anything Christie ever wrote in any form, a cleverly crafted tale of a maid unjustly accused of theft that Christie expertly guides through a number of unexpected turns to a completely unexpected conclusion. But such titles as \\"Strange Jest,\\" \\"Tape-Measure Murder,\\" \\"The Case of the Caretaker,\\" \\"Four and Twenty Blackbirds,\\" and \\"The Love Detectives\\" are utterly transparent at worst, minor works at best.<br /><br />The centerpiece of the collection, of course, is \\"Three Blind Mice.\\" This rather long story--more of a novella than a short--caused quite a stir among mystery readers when it debuted, and it would go on to considerably greater fame when Christie adapted it to the stage as THE MOUSETRAP, which has the distinction of being the single longest running play in theatrical history. But whatever its merits on the stage, and in spite of one of Christie's more startling plot turns, the style of the piece is decidedly melodramatic, artificial, and now and then down right clunky.  This is a collection more likely to appeal to determined Christie fans, particularly those who are interested in tracing out Christie's unique ability to reconstruct the plots of her minor short stories into considerably more successful full-length works. While the stories here are certainly readable (and considerably more interesting than the short fiction of such Christie contemporaries as Dorothy Sayers, whose style was less at home in short story format), this is not a collection I would greatly recommend to new fans.

After a sterling record at a home for \\"fallen women,\\" she finds work as a maid for the aristocratic but somewhat impoverished Maxie family, and once installed shows another aspect of her personality: a perverse pleasure in creating unpleasantness for virtually every one who crosses her path.  The Maxie family is largely impervious to her machinations...  but when Sally goes so far as to tantalize a proposal of marriage from the Maxie son, her game of troubling the water turns lethal, and Scotland Yard's Inspector Dalgliesh is on the job.<br />This 1962 effort was P.D. James' first novel, and at the time it drew enough praise to immediately place among the foremost mystery writers of the day.  And indeed there is much to be said for it: the story is well-constructed, the characters well drawn, and the crime is appropriately mysterious; on the whole it is a fast and fun read.  But not all P.D. James fans will be impressed.  Although there is more than a hint of the distinctive style and convolutions James will bring to her later work, it borrows a great deal in construction from Agatha Christie and not a little from Dorothy Sayers in terms of literary style, and Inspector Dalgliesh is not as well developed here as he will eventually become.<br />On the whole, I recommend the novel--but I recommend it to established fans of P.D. James, who will be interested to see her working in the \\"classic English murder mystery\\" style and enjoy comparing this debut work to the author's later and more impressive work.  First timers would do better to select one of the many novels that find James at the peak of her form--with DEATH OF AN EXPERT WITNESS or A TASTE FOR DEATH particularly recommended.	2003-05-24

In the aftermath of her child's death and a painful divorce, Hilary Craven travels to the Middle East in an effort to escape her past--and when this fails determines to kill herself.  But her attempt at suicide is foiled when she is confronted with an intelligence officer aware of her intention, an intelligence officer who makes her an unusual proposal: if you are so determined to die, why not do it in a way that would serve your country?  A nuclear scientist has defected; his wife, rushing to join him, has died in a plane crash.  And Hilary, intrigued, agrees to take the wife's place in an effort to trace the missing scientist and uncover the intent behind his disappearance.  It is a mission from which she is unlikely to return alive.<br />Although the premise is interesting, the resulting novel reads rather like the outline for a minor Alfred Hitchcock film.  Christie writes with her usual expertise, but the characters here are not greatly memorable and the story itself falls down a bit toward the novel's conclusion.  Still, it is a fast and fun read, and fans of the writer will likely enjoy it as a change of pace from her more typical fare.  Mildly recommended.<br />--GFT (Amazon reviewer)--	2003-05-15

But Christie has a distinct tendency to approach such material in a very tongue-in-cheek manner, and with this novel she is clearly less interested in weaving one of her celebrated mysteries than she is in tossing off some frothy fun.<br />DIALS revisits characters first met in THE CHIMNEYS, a novel set at the country estate of Lord Caterham and his sprightly daughter \\"Bundle.\\"  On this occasion, however, Lord Caterham has leased the estate to a captain of industry, and when an unexpected death occurs during a weekend house party Bundle finds herself drawn into an adventure that involves two murders, a plot to steal an important invention, and a mysterious association known as \\"The Seven Dials.\\"<br />While THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY is amusing to read, Christie doesn't quite manage to capture the madcap mood that makes such similar works as THE SECRET ADVERSARY so much fun to read--and with the exceptions of Bundle and Lord Caterham none of the characters here are greatly memorable.  Fans will enjoy it as an ultra-light and ultra-fast read, but this isn't a work that will remain in mind very long after the book has been finished and set aside.	2003-05-06

But when a young heiress staying at the hotel becomes involved with an undesirable man and the absent-minded Canon Pennyfeather mysteriously disappears from his rooms, Miss Marple quickly realizes that the hotel's famous service may include more than meets the eye.<br />Although Christie's novel successfully evokes the delicious pleasures of the hotel, the plot of AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL hinges on a series of unlikely coincidences and becomes increasingly transparent as the novel progresses.  The mastermind behind the current crime wave is extremely obvious--and when the murder at last arrives, quite late in the novel, the killer is more obvious still.  This is not one of the writer's better novels, and newcomers to Agatha Christie's works will likely be disappointed; recommended to hardcore fans only.	2003-05-03

Originally published as a two volume set in 1955 with author revisions in 1957 and 1960, this single volume text does not abridge the original text but merely confines it to a single binding.<br /><br />One's reaction to THE GREEK MYTHS will depend to some extent on one's purpose in acquiring it. This is an exhaustive collection of Greek mythology that far outstrips any other modern anthology that I have encountered, including myths both better known and extremely obscure.  Each myth is presented in concise, graceful prose, and where possible Graves includes genealogies of the characters and major variations of each myth; an interpretive essay also follows each myth.<br /><br />While Graves' retelling of the myths themselves have been widely praised, his interpretations of the myths have been somewhat criticized--and justly so. Graves tends to see incarnations of the &#34;White Goddess&#34; and the &#34;Sacrificial King&#34; in every third story; more dangerously, he tends to tie the myths to historical events in a highly speculative way.  While this does not undercut the interest of his interpretations, it does hold a number of traps for the casual reader, who may assume that Graves' essays offer standard, scholastically unbiased interpretations based on proven historical events.<br /><br />For myself, I use Graves' THE GREEK MYTHS as both reference and pleasure-reading, and I enjoy it a great deal; it is an indispensable purchase for any one with a serious interest in Greek mythology for any one who must frequently reference the same for scholarly purposes, and I strongly recommend it to them.  At the same time, however, I would hesitate to recommend it to readers who have not previously been exposed to Greek mythology or who wish only a general knowledge of the major Greek myths; in such cases I would instead recommend Edith Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY: TIMELESS TALES OF GODS AND HEROES.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweres I would instead recommend Edith Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY: TIMELESS TALES OF GODS AND HEROES.

While her work included short stories and theatre, she was most famous for her novels, most of which focused on strong women coping with errant men in panoramic settings.  SHOW BOAT was one of her first great successes.  Today the story is better known through its musical theatre incarnation and the film versions the stage show generated, including the 1936 version directed by James Whale and starring Irene Dunne and the 1951 version directed by George Sidney and starring Katherine Grayson.  But while the stage and screen versions have their charms, none really captures the epic nature of Ferber's novel, which is as much about America as it is about the story of post-Civil War show folk who ply their trade on \\"The Cotton Blossom\\"--a floating theatre that travels the nation's waterways, most particularly the mighty Mississippi.<br /><br />The story concerns three generations of women: Parthenia Hawks, a ram-rod upright New Englander who heartily disapproves of her husband's decision to purchase a show boat and involve the family with actors, God forbid; her daughter Magnolia, whose fresh beauty eventually propells her fame as one of the most popular actresses on the river; and her granddaughter Kim, who becomes a Broadway star.  But the backbone of the story concerns Magnolia's ill-fated love for ne'er-do-well gambler Gaylord Ravenal, a love that tests her strength to the last degree.  Just as Magnolia has to change to meet her constantly shifting circumstances, so is the nation changing around her, gradually shifting from a rather innocent, rural society to a much more hardened and sophistocated urban world.  And Magnolia's adventures will take her from the savage natural beauty of the mighty Mississippi to the gambling dens and brothels of 'Gilded Age' Chicago to the jumpiness of the 1920's 'Great White Way' of New York.<br /><br />Ferber was more of a popular than a literary writer, and her style here is very much of the 1910s and 1920s--but her prose is strong and clean, her imagery is magnificent, and as she tells her episodic story of a life and a nation in transition she weaves a number of interesting threads into the tapestry: the poverty of the beaten South, racial oppression, social caste, hypocrisy, and changing tastes in fashion and art.  And always, always there is the great river: indifferent to the humanity that clings to its banks and travels its back, by turns placid and savage, graceful and dangerous.  Ultimately the river becomes a metaphor for both the rapid changes in America and for the often dangerous power of love, and unlike the stage and film versions there will be few happy endings for the characters as they are swept through life's torrent very much as the Cotton Blossom is swept along the currents.  It is a memorable package, and while Ferber would go on to write a great many other novels (including the famous GIANT), SHOW BOAT is perhaps her single best work.

Once installed in a Russian Hill apartment and employed by a powerful advertising agency, she finds herself embroiled in one soap opera situation after another: drugs, sex, and intrigue abound in her newly adopted city, and the lives of the people that she meets overlap in some very unexpected ways.<br /><br />Although Mary Ann's adventures--which range from coping with suicidal help-line volunteers to dealing with extremely unpleasant pornographers--form the backbone of this novel, TALES OF THE CITY casts a broad net.  Reigning over Mary Ann's apartment house is the engmatic owner, Anna Madgridal, who seems to have formed a suspiciously deep affection for another tenant, advertising artist Mona, who is greatly attached to her gay room mate Mouse, who is friendly with lady-killer Brian who is warm for Mary Ann's form.  On the business front, her boss Edgar is coping with socialite wife Frannie and their excessively pampered daughter Didi--not to mention Didi's no good husband Beauchamp.  And needless to say, Frannie, Didi, and Beauchamp all have a few issues of their own.  What with one thing or another, they all run rampant through enough mood rings, gay beaches, opera societies, macrame, free sex, and Quaaludes to choke a mule.<br /><br />If there is a problem with TALES OF THE CITY, it is that it is a very topical, very localized sort of novel; if you didn't actually live in San Francisco during the 1970s (and I didn't), you may occasionally feel you're missing something when it comes to Maupin's more topical charactures and bits of satire.  But don't let that stand in your way: Maupin writes in a witty manner, and the characters and various threads of the story are so entertaining that you'll likely finish the book in one enormous gulp.

Wine notes in his preface to this collection, \\"Drama is the characteristic mode of expression of the English Renaisaance,\\" and while Shakespeare is the most famous dramatist of that period he was hardly the only one.  This text offers nine of that era's most famous plays by some of its most famous authors, many of whom rivaled Shakespeare in artistry if not volume or artistic consistency.<br />The volume includes 'The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus' by Christopher Marlowe (c. 1592); 'The Shoemakers' Holiday: A Pleasant Comedy of the Gentle Craft' by Thomas Dekker (1599); 'Volpone; or the Fox' by Ben Johnson (1606); 'The Knight of the Burning Pestle' by Francis Beaumont (possibly co-writing with John Fletcher, 1605); 'The Masque of Blackness' by Ben Johnson (1605); 'Philaster; or, Love Lies a-Bleeding' by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher (c. 1608); 'The Duchess of Malfi' by John Webster (c. 1613); 'The Changeling' by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley (1622); and 'The Broken Heart' by John Ford (c.1627.)  Each text is accompanied by an astute critical essay, a brief description of the author(s) life, and a description of the various sources from which the text has been drawn.<br />Aside from Wine's concise yet truly informative comments, the great thing about this volume is that it gives a very broad overview of the lightening-charged brilliance of the English drama as it developed during this period.  Readers interested in English drama will almost certainly recognize 'Dr. Faustus,' 'Volpone,' and 'The Duchess of Malfi'--but the lesser-known works are no less worthy of reading, with 'The Shoemakers' Holiday' a particular personal favorite. While the size of this volume--which is comparatively slim for an anthology of this type; it will rest easily in any standard bookcase--does not allow for exhaustive annotation, each text includes standard textual notations.  It is a superior introduction to the best of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama sans Shakespeare, and has been an integral volume in my own collection of dramatic literature for more than twenty years.

It is true that the novel is flawed: it is a great big rambling thing crammed with obvious allegory, metaphor, and allusion, loosely structured to say the least.  And yet, in a odd sort of way, the very rambling, the looseness, the obviousness of the work gives it a tremendous grandeur that Steinbeck's more tightly structured work lacks.  The novel is as broad and vulgar and lively and provocative as the America it describes--and it is my favorite of Steinbeck's fiction.<br /><br />Any one who comes to the novel from the famous film adaptation starring James Dean will be surprized, for the roots of the novel run much deeper than the film, which is based only on perhaps a third of the novel.  This is not so much the story of brothers Aaron and Caleb Trask as it is the story of their parents, Adam Trask and Catherine Ames.  And in &#34;Cathy&#34; Ames, Steinbeck creates one of the darkest characters in all of 20th Century American Literature, a creature devoid of virtually anything recognizable as human emotion.  Fleeing from a past that includes murder, perversion, blackmail, and prostitution, Cathy assumes an angelic demeanor and lures the emotionally needy Adam Trask into love and marriage.  And when she no longer requires his protection... she destroys him.<br /><br />It is the stuff of classic melodrama, but in Steinbeck's hands it becomes more than melodrama; it becomes a novel that alternately reads at leisurely pace and then suddenly reads with the speed of a whirlwind, a tale that forces us to consider the nature of good and evil and the legacies we may leave for later generations.  For Adam and Cathy have two sons, and in the wake of their tragedy they will be left to fight out issues of moral choices, right and wrong, and love and hate in the sun-drenched Salinas Valley of California, the &#34;golden west&#34; of the &#34;new world&#34; as it rushes headlong into the modern age.  It is a novel epic in history, geography, and morality.<br /><br />Some will find the novel's constant reference to the story of Cain and Able more than a little obvious; others will find it too meandering, filled with too many side-issues and minor subplots.  Still others may be put off by the very slow way in which the novel gathers itself during its first hundred or so pages.  But once the pieces are in place, Steinbeck suddenly pulls the threads together to create one of the most remarkable tapestries in American letters--a tapestry that has no clearcut boundaries and that, for all its simplistic tone, offers little in the way of simplistic answers to the issues it raises.  Flawed, yes, but a great novel by a master of the form, so great that its flaws become intrinsic to its virtues.

She was born in poverty, raised in a broken home, had little formal education, still less in the way of social graces.  She taught herself to dance by watching Fred Astaire on the silver screen.  Then, while still a teenager, she crashed Broadway on a schoolgirl dare, making her mark with the hit BEST FOOT FORWARD.  When MGM bought the screen rights she went along for the ride--and hit the career jackpot, emerging as one of the most popular stars of the 1940s and 1950s.  Married to movie star, director, producer, and noted Republican Dick Powell, she lived at the center of both Hollywood's film and political scene for more than two decades.  It's a biographer's dream.<br />And yet--  This is not the great autobiography that it could have been, largely because Allyson is so completely uncritical in her thinking about her own life and the various people who moved through it.  Although such figures as George Murphy, Richard and Pat Nixon, and Ronald and Nancy Regan were frequent guests in the Powell-Allyson home, we learn little more about them beyond the occasional antedote--certainly nothing about their politics or what Allyson herself thought of politics, if indeed she had any thoughts on the subject at all.  Perhaps more startling, given Allyson's own star-status, is her take on such figures as Judy Garland and Alan Ladd, both of whom figure heavily in the Allyson autobiography; while Allyson acknowledges that Garland used drugs and that Ladd was a heavy drinker, she never really references the dark sides of their behavior, and again it is difficult to know if this is because she feels loyalty to them or if indeed she herself ever knew anything of it to begin with.  Even so, when Allyson writes of individuals that she flatly did not like, she doesn't pull any punches.  Her portrait of an afternoon with Joan Crawford is chilling, she repeatedly slams gossip columnist Hedda Hopper--and when considering such individuals as Alan Ladd's formidable wife Sue or Dick Powell's previous wife Joan Blondell, Allyson's tone turns rather steely.<br />But what ultimately emerges from this autobiography, and emerges whether Allyson intended it or not, is a portrait of a woman who married a man that was determined his wife should never challenge him in any way.  Indeed, June Allyson might have coined the term \\"co-dependent\\" on the basis of her marriage to Dick Powell.  In reading Allyson's autobiography (which was co-written with Frances Spatz Leighton), it is very clear that she loved Dick Powell, and loved him deeply; it is also very clear that, in spite of his often glitchy personality, he returned that love.  But again, it is difficult to know if Allyson herself is aware of the fact that Powell essentially forced her dependency or whether or not she recognizes that the degree of that dependency was largely responsible for her collapse in the wake of Powell's death.  While it may be difficult to know how to take this book in an overall sense, it does do one thing very, very effectively: the tone of voice here is distinctly June Allyson.  You can almost hear that unique voice, with its odd mix of rasp and velvet, speaking the words aloud.  And while it may raise as many questions as it ultimately answers, it is a well written book and an entertaining read.

But few authors seem able to create both excellent novels and excellent short stories, and Sayers is no exception to the general rule.<br />Her wordy style simply does not show as well in the short story form as it does in a novel-length work, and she has considerable difficulty in actually constructing plots for these stories that might in any way be described as \\"mysteries\\" per se.  While most of the stories collected here are readable in a general sort of way, they read more as 1920s pulp-adventure than as \\"mystery.\\"  Fans of the Lord Peter Wimsey series (myself among them) will certainly enjoy them, and have fun noting that Sayers later expanded some of these short story ideas into more substantial work, but newcomers will likely be unimpressed.

Scarlett's ideal mate, Rhett Butler, has left her--and she is determined to get him back.  But can she?  Did she?  And author Margaret Mitchell was beseiged with fans who wanted to know.  To one and all Mitchell gave the same answer: the story ended where it ended.  There was nothing more to tell.  But where there is a will, there is a way--and especially so where there is a buck to be made.  Some thirty-plus years after her untimely death, Mitchell's estate was persuaded to release the rights, and Alexandria Ripley was contracted to \\"finish\\" the story.<br /><br />Although she is writing a sequel, Ripley goes to considerable pain to prevent readers from compairing her style and her novel to Mitchell's style and her novel--and so, wisely perhaps, Ripley wastes little time in killing off Mammy and moving the action out of Georgia entirely.  But Ripley also revises the leading characters, and in the most bizarre ways imaginable.  Scarlett gives Tarah to her sister Sue Ellen and runs off to Ireland, where she learns it is much easier to dance a jig if you take your corset off first.  Give away Tara?  To the sister she always hated?  Ireland?  Stranger still, when Rhett leaves Scarlett he goes to Charleston, where he tries to make amends with his family while also indulging his love of horticulture.  HORTICULTURE?  Well Hush My Mouth And Stuff Me With Chiltins!<br /><br />Now, Ripley--who is best known for such mild-mannered but best-selling historical romances as CHARLESTON--isn't a bad writer.  And frankly, if we changed the names Rhett and Scarlett to something else, this would be an okay book.  But Ripley ain't no Margaret Mitchell.

James is reknowned for her ability to combine the psychological novel with the classic murder mystery--but now and then her emphasis on psychology so overshadows her plot that it becomes hard to describe the work as a murder mystery per se.  Such is the case with THE BLACK TOWER, a profoundly bleak novel set in an isolated home for \\"the young disabled,\\" a euphemistic term for victims of slowly progressing but ultimately fatal muscular disease.<br />The story begins when Inspector Dalgliesh, himself recovering from both a serious illness and a crisis of confidence, is invited to Toynton Grange by the home's elderly chaplin; something is amiss, and the chaplin would welcome Dalgliesh's advice.  But when Dalgliesh arrives, he finds his old friend has died a few days earlier.  With little to go on except his own suspicion, Dalgliesh slowly, grudingly begins to investigate... and finds one suspicious death after another.<br />The premise is a classic set up, but in this novel James places Dalgliesh more as an observer of the inevitable than as a detective, and when the solution arrives it does so more by intuition and assumption than by logical deduction.  But if this element is weak, the overall novel is very strong: moody to the point of despair, and peopled with painfully pitiful characters, THE DARK TOWER is perhaps one of James' more memorable novels in terms of style alone.  Flawed, yes; recommended nonetheless.  But be forewarned: you may need prescription medication to escape the sense of depression the novel creates.	2002-11-14

This expanded edition of THE PORTABLE DOROTHY PARKER collects all three of her volumes of poetry, both volumes of her collected short stories, and a great deal more besides--all of it guaranteed to give readers hour after delightful hour.<br />Like her contemporary and only serious competitor James Thurber, Parker's work often focused on the battle of the sexes, and many of her short stories--such as \\"Dusk Before Fireworks,\\" \\"You Were Perfectly Fine,\\" and \\"Here We Are\\"--present savagely funny portaits of couples who are on the edge in more ways than one.  She is also extremely famous for her 'monologue' stories, particularly \\"Telephone Call,\\" in which the reader essentially overhears the thoughts of the character it portrays.  But she is perhaps best remembered for her sharply comic poetry, which is typically written as a subverted 'jingle' that goes unexpectedly awry, often in the most morbid way imaginable; \\"One Perfect Rose\\" and \\"You Might As Well Live,\\" to name but two, have been standards of American poetry collections since they were first published.  And no theatrical critic has ever equalled Parker for sheer comic acidity.<br />But Parker was not simply a humorist.  While a number of her poems address deeper subjects--\\"Rainy Night\\" is particularly memorable--many of her short stories are intensely dramatic.  \\"Big Blonde\\" details the slow decline of a woman who is passed from man to man, never finding happiness and drifting into alcoholism and attempted suicide; \\"Clothe the Naked\\" presents a touching portrait of a black woman struggling to survive in a hostile white world.  Her eye for detail is remarkable; her style is distinctly her own, a mixture of the clinical and the wryly comic; be it comic or tragic, she is in full command of her art in every selection.  This is one that belongs on your shelf, no question about it.

One of the most popular of these was Glendon Swarthout's BLESS THE BEASTS AND THE CHILDREN, a novel that raised a number of issues re social status quos, its impact on children, and its impact on the enviroment.  Few novels of this type have survived the passing years unscathed, and this one is no exception--but sadly, and particularly in light of such recent events as the Columbine shootings, the novel still has a surprising degree of relevance even today.<br /><br />The story concerns a group of misfit boys who have been dumped into a summer camp by largely unconcerned parents and who find themselves ostracized and reviled by both camp instructors and the other boys.  Constantly berrated and harrassed, they are designated &#34;The Bedwetters&#34; and are relegated to the fringe of camp activities.  During a field trip, the boys are taken to see a corralled herd of buffalo--and are horrified when the buffalo are slaughtered before them.  They resolve to escape the camp overnight, return to the corral, and free the remaining buffalo before they too can be killed.  As the story of their trip unfolds, the novel flashes back to revel the background of each of boy and describes how they evolved into the personalities they have become--and in a real sense, the adventure they undertake ultimately validates the worth of each, as the differences that the status quo perceives as weakness actually becomes the strengths that motivate and aid them on their journey.  But their determination to free the buffalo will come at a terrific price, a higher price than any of them can imagine.<br /><br />As literature per se, the novel has several weaknesses.  The actual story feels contrived, the symbolism is heavy handed to say the least, the shifts into flashback are a bit awkward, and the author never really achieves a good flow or a distinctive tone of voice.  But even so, the book still speaks with remarkable power about the dangers of equating &#34;being different&#34; with &#34;being undesirable&#34; and of a society that has little use for anything outside the most pragmatic boundaries.  It is most likely to appeal to teenagers and young adults, but more mature readers will find much food for thought within it as well.

James' work occasionally collapses under its own weight as the author strains to combine psychological novel with crafty murder mystery--but DEATH OF AN EXPERT WITNESS shows the writer at her best, creating a memorable setting in rural England, a host of very believable characters, and a complex plot, with all aspects of the work coming together in seamless fashion.<br /><br />Dr. Lorrimer is a forensic scientist employed at a police laboratory, well respected by the scientific community and a bastion of authority in the witness box.  Unfortunately, he is also a singularly unpleasant man: bitter at being passed over for promotion, petty in his dealings with underlings, vindictive in his personal relationships.  So it is hardly surprising when he is murdered--but the circumstances are something of a shock: he is clubbed to death in the middle of his own laboratory, a situation that seems to indicate one or more of his co-workers is involved.  And Chief Inspector Dalgliesh has an abundance of suspects from which to select.<br /><br />James' detective Dalgliesh is a rather dour creation, and in some James novels he can become a tiresome companion--but here James balances his darkness against the demands of the overall novel to considerable effect.  The result is a stylish, atmospheric work with an intelligent plot and a satisfying conclusion--a book to keep mystery fans sitting up all night.

But no sooner do police suspicions begin to form around one of the three than murder strikes again--and then again--in such a way as to leave them baffled.  Enter, of course, Miss Marple, who sets about uncovering a killer who may be a psychotic that is killing victims in accordance with the old \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\" nursey rhyme.<br />Most of Christie's great novels were written in the 1930s and 1940s.  Although she could still create a stunner when she wished, with A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED a case in point, by the 1950s Christie favored a less complicated approach, preferring to write novels that might be described as creamy confections for a very civilized high tea.  A POCKET FULL OF RYE is perhaps the perfect example.  Like most Christie novels, the plot is extremely contrived--but in this instance she makes no effort to conceal the contrivance; it is a shell game, pure and simple and without pretension, a game undertaken for the pleasure of it.  And when Christie sets out to write a novel for the pure fun of it, there is always a great deal of fun to be had.  This will never rank among her greatest works, but fans will devour it in a single sitting and feel as satisified as if they had just enjoyed a blow-out of cream buns.  Thoroughly enjoyable.	2002-08-25

And this time the murder is a particularly bloody one: a member of the hospital staff is found with his throat cut ear to ear in the hospital boiler room.  As usual, the mystrey entices Postmistress Mary \\"Harry\\" Harristeen--and when her own safety is threatened, her two cats (Mrs. Murphy and Pewter) and dog (Tee-Tucker) come to the rescue by investigating the crime for themselves.<br />The Mrs. Murphy series is light reading, of course, and taking it too seriously undermines the fun.  As usual, the great attraction here is not the plot--for Brown has never really bothered to work out the tightly puzzle prized by hard-core mystery fans--but the way in which the thing is written: frothy, funny, and amusing.  Unfortunately, CLAWS AND EFFECT has little of the froth we usually expect, and it may be that Brown has begun to tire of her creation, but it still makes for an entertaining way to pass an evening.

But some of Sayers' work has a tendency toward incessant clutter--and no where is that more apparent than in this 1931 novel, which finds Lord Peter investigating a suspicious death in Scotland.<br /><br />The plot of THE FIVE RED HERRINGS begins with some promise: the victim is a man despised by virtually everyone in town, so no one is greatly shocked when his body is found in a creek at the bottom of a ravine.  But the story soon acquires a mechanical feeling: of six possible suspects, HALF are unexpectedly and mysteriously out of town--and tracking them down allows Sayers to indulge her love of time-tables and train schedules to the nth degree.  It makes for some very dry narrative indeed. At the same time, Sayers attempts to duplicate the Scottish accent of the locals on the page itself, and the result is page after page of phonetic spellings and oddly placed aphostrophes.  It is more than a little off-putting.<br /><br />In spite of these drawbacks, the book does have its graces, chiefly in Sayers' knack for turning a witty phrase and in her ever-developing portrait of Lord Peter Wimsey.  And to do Sayers justice, the gimmicky plot and the emphasis on time-tables, etc. is rather typical of 1920s and 1930s murder mysteries.  Such books often have a great deal of period charm, but frankly, THE FIVE RED HERRINGS is not among them.  Die-hard Sayers fans will certainly want to read this novel, and many will get a good degree of pleasure from it... but newcomers to Dorothy Sayers' work should start with one of her later successes, and I specifically recommend MURDER MUST ADVERTISE to them instead.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2002-08-01

THE BIG SLEEP suffered from a plot that fell apart in midstream; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is much more consistent throughout.  On the other hand, for all its twists and turns, THE BIG SLEEP was quite plausible; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is about as farfetched as you can get.  But once again, such criticisms are almost beside the point: the great attraction is still Chandler's knock-you-flat prose, his tone of voice, his often imitated but seldom equaled style, and it is so powerful that it keeps you turning page after page after page.<br />In general, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY once more finds street-smart and super-savvy California P.I. Philip Marlowe sticking his nose where it has no business being--and when curiosity leads him to follow a massively built white man into a black nightclub he finds himself embroiled in a murder no one cares about solving... at least not until it begins to figure in what seems to be a completely different case with a high-society spin.  And encounters with stolen jewels, a spiritualist racket, police corruption, and a gambling ship quickly follow.<br />Along the way Chandler again paints a gritty portrait of the seamy side of life.  On this occasion, he takes a passing look at race, and makes the point that from a police point of view two standards apply: the authorities care nothing about the murder of a black man, but they treat a white man's murder very differently indeed.  This portion of the novel is intrinsically controversial, for Chandler uses the slang and racial slurs common to the mean streets of his era--but it is worth noting that although Marlowe uses the same language, his attitude toward the blacks who appear in the novel is considerably different from that of the authorities, who could not care less about the murder of a black man who don't much care who knows it. And once again, Chandler graces his pages with dames and dandies, broads and bums--and he makes them live with remarkable vitality.  The famous prose is as rich as ever, although noticeably less witty and quite a bit darker than that found in THE BIG SLEEP.  We've stepped off the curb and into the gutter, Chandler seems to be saying, and we're walking in it all the way.

Cain's THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE.  Likewise, there isn't any question about where the tough California P.I. novel started: the credit goes to Dashiell Hammett's THE MALTESE FALCON.  But in 1939, a pulp magazine writer fused the two concepts, and the result is a style--street-smart, tough, witty, and compellingly direct--that belongs to one writer only: Raymond Chandler.  And his first novel, THE BIG SLEEP, made him a household name.<br /><br />In some respects THE BIG SLEEP is a problematic novel.  The plot concerns detective Philip Marlowe's efforts to protect the wealthy Sternwood family from blackmail--but from this starting point it spins out into several complicated directions.  Chandler manages this myriad of elements very well through the first half of the novel, but at mid-point the plot breaks apart into a series of loose ends and improbabilities from which it doesn't recover until the last fifty pages--and then only just.  But that is almost beside the point.  Thanks to Chandler's unique style, you simply can't put the book down long enough to criticize it.<br /><br />THE BIG SLEEP reads with tremendous speed and power, creating a portrait of a seamy world ruled by bisexual pornographers, purring hitmen, cheap hoods, and enameled dames determined to have their way no matter what--a fascinating collection of everything small and mean and gutter common.  At the same time, it also presents a surprising degree of integrity in the midst of the corruption: Marlowe won't sell out, no matter what the bribe, and behind their various masks the hardbitten Vivien Sternwood, mysterious Mona Mars, and small-time Harry Jones have enough courage, loyalty, and unexpected integrity to win your respect.<br /><br />THE BIG SLEEP is not the perfect novel.  But it is extremely, extremely readable, and with it Chandler paves the way for everything from Sue Grafton's popular mystery series to television crime drama.  Chandler's voice here is often imitated, but it has been seldom equalled and never really bested, and both his style and THE BIG SLEEP remain as potent today as they were when the novel was first published.

But perfection comes at a price, and when older son Buck dies in a boating accident and surviving son Conrad attempts suicide the difference between the American dream and American reality becomes painfully apparent.  The mask of perfection cracks, and those who hide behind it find themselves emotionally unable to rebuild their lives.<br />Judith Guest brings the reader into the story at the middle, shortly after son Conrad's release from the hospital--and with a somewhat sparse but remarkably eloquent style quickly develops the characters that people Conrad's world as he fights to find balance between his parents and himself, as he works desperately to find a way out of the expectation of perfection imposed upon him by both himself and the society in which he moves.<br />Guest's characters move with considerable reality and a touching humanity above the novel's unexpectedly complex underpinnings, and the author's prose is smooth, easy to read and understand, and completely faultless.  Among the most astonishing elements of the work is the fact that Guest writes the entire novel in the present tense--a risky choice, but one which she brings off with amazing skill.

Even so, it does contain a few gems that make purchase of this title necessary to Thurber fans.<br />The showpiece of this collection is the famous but somewhat over-rated \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" but MY WORLD also includes a number of seldom anthologized pieces that show Thurber's wit at a high-water mark, including \\"The Whip-Poor-Will,\\" \\"A Friend to Alexander,\\" and \\"The MacBeth Murder Mystery.\\"  It also includes several examples of Thurber's acid perspective on the battle of the sexes, such as \\"Death in the Zoo,\\" and several memorable examples of his ability to wring laughter from the perfidies of language, such as \\"What Do You Mean, It 'Was' Brilling?\\" and \\"Here Lies Miss Gorby.\\"<br />But the bulk of MY WORLD consists of much less focused material that Thurber casually produced for THE NEW YORKER--pieces which are mildly humorous examinations of everything from French guidebooks to 19th century copies of the English magazine PUNCH.  Thurber's clever prose lends such pieces considerable charm, but they are decidedly minor works when compaired with the side-splitting classics found in other collections.  Thurber fans, of course, will be delighted by most of it, but newcomers would likely be happier with such collections as A THURBER CARNIVAL.	2002-07-21

It is unevenly written; the storyline is somewhat repetitive; the characters are sometimes poorly motivated; the relationship between central characters Mario Santelli and Tommy Zane betrays a certain innocence on the part of the author.  But for all its flaws and failings, THE CATCH TRAP is simply one of the most compulsively readable novels I have ever encountered.<br /><br />The thing that makes the novel so impossible to put down is that everything about it is vividly, vividly alive. Set in the world of the circus of the 1940s and 1950s, the novel tells the story of teenager Tommy Zane, the son of a lion tamer, who dreams of becoming a trapeze artist--and who is taken under the wing of a famous family, The Flying Santellis.  Bradley not only gives the novel tremedous sweep, she is so meticulous in her portrayal of circus life that you can smell the popcorn and feel the sawdust; the environment lives and breathes around the characters in a most remarkable way.<br /><br />But no novel survives on atmosphere alone.  Bradley's story is equally unexpected: the star flyer, Mario Santelli, is homosexual--and he and teenage Tommy embark on a passionate love affair.  But not only is Tommy underage, this is the 1940s and 1950s; the secrecy their relationship requires proves devastating to both, driving them into a downward spiral of guilt and despair even as they risk their lives on the trapeze with every performance.  And around the two swirl a myriad of colorful characters as brilliant as a storm of confetti: the tempetuous Santelli family itself, the movers and shakers of their profession, the contrasting high flyers and lowlifes they encounter as they move from carny midway to center ring, from stardom to disaster.<br /><br />One of the most surprising things about the novel is how romantically Bradley presents the relationship between Mario and Tommy and--for all her rather elementary assumptions about gay men and their relationships--how effective her approach is.  You believe in them, you believe in the world in which they move, and page after page you want to know what happens next.

If ever there was \\"the great war novel of the 20th century,\\" this is it, and I do not use that description lightly.<br />The novel is flawless.  Told from the point of view of a young solider named Paul, ALL QUIET presents the story of German youths who enlist during World War I under the influence of a professor, who assures them that their service will make a vital difference to the cause and bring them honor and glory.  Once inside the military machine, however, they endure training that consists largely of attention to petty detail and abuse of authority before being fed into the hell of the war's infamous trench warfare--in which thousands die pointlessly as they take, lose, and re-take the same few yards of land over and over again.<br />Remarque's style here is remarkable, for he keeps his prose simple and direct and easy to read without allowing it to become commonplace.  Great horrors are presented casually, for they are the stuff of every day life; at the same time, the occasional moment of beauty--be it the blue sky on a clear day, the solace of friendship, or the satisfaction of enough to eat--stand out in high relief against the hell of battle.  And as the novel progresses and the characters change, harden, and sometimes warp and break under the stress of battle, we find ourselves repeatedly confronted with both the nobility and tragedy of the ordinary man at war.<br />ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT still speaks in ringing tones, and it will not doubt continue to do so as long as war itself continues.  Not just strongly recommended; it is required reading for all those who call themselves human.	2002-07-06

The plot is also considerably less lean, and Hammett packs it with a number of unnecessary excursions that tend to sidetrack the flow of action.  The result is less of an action-packed detective story than it is a portrait of New York in the early 1930s, where cops are brutal and stupid, society rubs shoulders with criminals in lowlife speakeasies, and every one is out for what they can get.<br />And what they want are sex and money and more sex, preferrably laced with bootleg liquior.  Fans of the film will easily recognize the basic plot: retired detective Nick Charles is unwilling dragged into the search for a former client, inventor Clyde Wynant, who is wanted for questioning in connection with the brutal murder of his secretary-mistress.  But not only the police want him: ex-wife Mimi is low on funds and would like to lay hands on his dough, his estranged children Dorothy and Gilbert have vested interests of their own, and Mimi's current husband is playing his own hand as well.  The characters are considerably darker here, particularly in reference to Dorothy and Gilbert, with Dorothy a manipulative and hard-drinking little tramp and Gilbert an ineffectual weakling; mother Mimi is viciously neurotic and abusive; and the missing Clyde Wynant is so eccentric that whether or not he had a hand in the murder he clearly needs to be locked up.  To further complicate matters, both Dorothy and Mimi are on the make for Nick Charles.  As for Nick and wife Nora, they possess considerable sparkle--but they too are of this world, Nick clearly en route to an alcoholic hell and pulling Nora along with him.<br />Hammett writes with his usual strength, but as a novel THE THIN MAN lacks the focus of his more famous THE MALTESE FALCON, and his digressions and excursions hinder the book as a whole. Even so, his dark and frequently witty look at the underbelly of depression-era New York packs enough punch to bring it in at a solid four stars.  Recommended for fans of the classic \\"hard boiled\\" style, but probably of more interest to hard-core completists than casual readers.N, and his digressions and excursions hinder the book as a whole.

They are the best of West's work, and I recommend them very highly.  But West's work was extremely hit or miss, and this edition of his two lesser novels demonstrate that fact in abundance.<br />THE DREAM LIFE OF BALSO SNELL is West's first novel, a surrealistic fantasy about a man who stumbles upon the Trojan Horse, climbs into the rectum, and meanders through the horse's lower intestines.  Along the way he meets an aesthetically argumentative guide, a biographer who is writing a biography of a biographer, a mystic who is attempting to crucify himself with thumbtacks, and sundry others.  There is an abundance of ideas here, some of them quite amusing and entertaining, but ultimately this parody of bad-taste pseudo-intellectualism becomes as bad-taste pseudo-intellectual as its subjects.<br />Written between MISS LONELYHEARTS and LOCUST, A COOL MILLION satirizes the American dream via an extended parody of the Horatio Alger myth, and presents us with the story of a young man who goes out into the world to seek his fortune--and begins his adventures with his lady love sold into white slavery and he himself cast wrongfully into prison.  This is an extremely bitter, often funny novel, and it is considerably more readable than BALSO SNELL, but its dryness quickly becomes tedious and the work lags far, far behind either MISS LONELYHEARTS or LOCUST.<br />These novels are interesting failures at best, and while West fans will enjoy seeing how the writer developed but both THE DREAM LIFE OF BALSO SNELL and A COOL MILLION have more academic interest than anything else.  Recommended for hardcore fans, but all others should pass them by.	2002-06-16

His reputation rests squarely upon two works: MISS LONELYHEARTS, the tale of a newspaper advice columnist who is overwhelmed by the tragedies of those who write to him for advice, and THE DAY OF THE LOCUST, a savage vision of American society turning upon the illusions fosted upon them by a Hollywood mentality.<br />Both MISS LONELYHEARTS and LOCUST are powerful works, every bit as vital and unnerving today as when they were first published in the 1930s; I recommend both very strongly.  But the remainder of West's cannon is extremely problematic.  Like the little girl with the curl, when West was good he was very, very good, and when he was bad he was horrid.  And with its inclusion of his lesser writings, this Library of America anthology gives us a detailed tour of the latter.<br />THE DREAM LIFE OF BALSO SNELL, West's first novel, was an experimental tale that parodies intellectual pretentions through religious, mythological, and aesthetic motifs--but while it has a number of fascinating ideas and conceits, it is at best an interesting failure.  A COOL MILLION, West's third novel, is a satire on the Horatio Alger myth; it is considerably more readable than SNELL, but it lags far behind both LONELYHEARTS and LOCUST.<br />The rest of the anthology consists of a failed Broadway play, an unfilmed screenplay, unpublished stories and fragments, juvenalia, and personal letters.  Both the play and screenplay--GOOD HUNTING and BEFORE THE FACT respectively--are written very much against the grain; it is not difficult to see why the play failed and director Hitchcock (who filmed BEFORE THE FACT as SUSPICION) ordered a completely new script.  The remaining items are mediocre at best, dire at worst, and although West's letters are interesting from a historical standpoint they have no literary merit per se.<br />West's life was cut short by an automobile accident just as he seemed to be finding his true voice, and it is interesting to speculate on how his writing might have developed if he had lived to write more.  This is an important collection--but it's importance is largely of an academic nature rather than a literary one, of more interest to the serious student of American literature than to a casual reader.  If you fall into the latter catagory, I strongly recommend that you read MISS LONELYHEARTS and DAY OF THE LOCUST (both of which are available in inexpensive editions) rather than purchase this particular volume--and only after, if you like so many others among us find yourself fascinated by West's work, contemplate purchase of this anthology.eresting from a historical standpoint they have no literary merit per se.<br />West's life was cut short by an automobile accident just as he seemed to be finding his true voice, and it is interesting to speculate on how his writing might have developed if he had lived to write more.

This is particularly true of his two best works, MISS LONELYHEARTS and THE DAY OF THE LOCUST.  Both novels are short and intense, and both present horrific visions of American society choking to death on its own mass-media fantasies.<br />Probably West's most powerful work, MISS LONELYHEARTS concerns a nameless man assigned to produce a newspaper advice column--but as time passes he begins to break under the endless misery of those who write to him for advice.  Unable to find answers, and with his shaky Christianity ridiculed into destruction by his poisonous editor, he tumbles into a madness fueled by his own spiritual emptiness.  First published in 1933, MISS LONELYHEARTS remains one of the most shocking works of 20th Century American literature, as unnerving as a glob of black bile vomited up at a church social, empty, blasphemous, and horrific.<br />THE DAY OF THE LOCUST is the best known of West's works, and presents the story of a Hollywood art designer as he drifts through the California dream factory--a place in which reality exists only as something to subvert into a saleable commodity: an addictive series of dreams that won't come true for the increasing numbers of malcontents that crowd Los Angeles in search of the fantasies seen on the movie screen.  And their seething disillusionment proves more deadly than even Hollywood could ever imagine.  First published in 1939, THE DAY OF THE LOCUST is still considered the single most scathing novel ever written about Hollywood.<br />Like much of West's work, these two novels are written in a comic style that the author deliberately and quickly sours: laughter quickly gives way to despair, despair to surreal horror, and all of it condensed into tightly written, noir-ish, and double-gritty prose that has the impact of a wrecking ball.  West is not a writer for every one, not by a long shot, but his power is undeniable, and these two works are his best, essentials in American literature.  But brace yourself: they offer one-way tickets going straight down all the way.prose that has the impact of a wrecking ball.

And such is particularly the case of the Bennetts, a family of daughters whose father's estate is entailed to a distant relative, for upon Mr. Bennett's death they will lose home, land, income, everything.  But are the Bennett daughters up to playing a winning hand in this high-stakes matrimonial game without forfeiting their own personal integrity?<br /><br />This battle of the sexes is largely seen through the eyes of second daughter Elizabeth, who possesses a razor-sharp wit and rich sense of humor--and who finds herself hindered by her own addlepated mother, her sister Jane's hopeless love for the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and her sister Lydia's penchant for scandal... not to mention the high-born, formidable, and outrageously proud Mr. Darcy, who seems determined to trump her every card.  But the game of love proves more surprising than either Elizabeth or Mr. Darcy can imagine, and sometimes a seemingly weak hand proves a winning one when all cards are on the table.<br /><br />PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is simply one of the funniest novels ever written, peopled with memorable characters brought vividly to life as they both succeed and fail at the game of life according to the manners of their era.  It is a novel to which I return again and again, enjoying Austen's brillant talent. I have little respect for people who describe it as dull, slow, out of date, for as long as men and women live and fall in love it will never be out of style, always be meaningful, and always be funny.  A masterpiece of wit and style; a timeless novel for the ages.	2002-06-12

(Midnight Classics)	Books	4	28	30	N	N	A Metaphor For The Failure of the American Dream	Considered experimental when first published in 1935, Hoarce McCoy's THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY is a series of extended flashbacks recalled by a prisoner as he stands before a judge pronouncing sentence upon him.  But although the novel's structure drew considerable comment at the time, HORSES is best recalled for its vivid portrait of the depression-era fad for Marathon Dances and the gritty tone in which it sketches its desperate characters.<br />Written in the style of 1930s pulp fiction, the novel essentially presents both characters and Marathon Dance as a metaphor for a world in which those without money and social status struggle for survival with the only certainty in life being death itself--and whose struggle becomes a vicarious entertainment for the more secure.  Although the novel is extremely short, it presents the reader with a powerful and very memorable series of images, most of which were well used by the famous 1960s Jane Fonda film version.<br />Powerful though it is, the novel does have some flaws, chief among them McCoy's failure to fully expand upon his metaphor of the Marathon Dance and his tendency to introduce additional ideas upon which he never really expands; the characters also read as rather flat.  Even so, THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY's central concept and hard-edged prose is so impressive that the book possesses a compulsive readability; it is very much a book that you can't put down.  Recommended.	2002-06-06

But success is fleeting, and Stan falls prey to the very insecurities that have driven him to success.  When it comes, his fall has all the horror of being dropped into a blast furnace.<br />Gresham writes in a tough-voiced pulp fiction tone that lingers over the most unsavory aspects of the story--sometimes to the point of nausea--and the result is a harsh vision of the world as a \\"nightmare alley,\\" a one-way run with unseen hounds hell after you and death when you meet the brick wall at the end.  The characters are memorable: the glib-tongued Stan, embroiled in his own Freudian hell; the hardknocks but likeable Zeena, a carny psychic who starts Stan on his career; the pretty but stupid Molly, who becomes Stan's unwilling partner in crime; and, always lurking somewhere in the background, the carny geek, the ultimate portrait in degredation and desperation, a monsterous man-made grotesque whose image frames the novel.<br />The novel is deliberately disorienting, and each new section of the book is heralded by the use of a Tarot card to remarkable effect. NIGHTMARE ALLEY is powerful stuff, and it shouldn't be read on an empty stomach.  Recommended, but brace yourself: when you pick up the book you'll find yourself on an express elevator, and it's straight down all the way.	2002-06-06

Leroux's original creation, however, is quite a bit different: he is a professional torturer and a serial killer whose evil nature is mirrored in his grotesque physical appearance.  Wanted by the police, he conceals himself in the Paris opera--and the authorities promptly use his interest in a beautiful singer as bait with which to capture him.<br />Although the storyline has been reworked enough times for us to admit that Leroux was onto something here, Leroux was not a great writer and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA reads very much as if Charles Dickens had suddenly elected to write a Victorian \\"penny dreadful.\\"  Leroux never uses one word when fifteen will do, and the story moves very slowly with many a detour; even as the heroes crawl through the opera's basement labyrinths they find time for considerable conversation along the way.  Fans of the later adaptations will be greatly interested in the novel, but most people will find it an up-hill read with little reward for all the effort.  Primarily of interest to scholars, historians, and hardcore fans of later adaptations.	2002-06-05

This volume collects three of his most memorable scripts: the fantasy BLITHE SPIRIT, the farce HAY FEVER, and the razor-wicked PRIVATE LIVES.<br />Of the three, BLITHE SPIRIT and PRIVATE LIVES are best known to the general public through various film versions and frequent revivals.  BLITHE SPIRIT concerns a novelist who invites a medium to give a seance that he might learn tricks of the trade for the book he is writing--but the medium is no fake, and she unintentionally summons up the ghost of his first wife, who promptly moves in and makes his second wife's life a living hell.  PRIVATE LIVES offers the story of a divorced couple who unexpectedly meet while honeymooning with their new spouses--whom they quickly abandon in order to resume their torrid passion for each other.  Trouble is, although they love each other desperately, their personalities are about as compatible as two scorpions in a bottle.  HAY FEVER, one of Coward's earliest successes, presents the story of visitors to an eccentric family who are very nearly driven mad before they are able to escape.<br />Coward was reknowned for his sophistocated and often acid turn of phrase, and all three of these plays contain enough outrageous situations and sharp-tongued lines to make even the worst sourpuss laugh loud enough to annoy the neighbors.  Although those unused to reading playscripts may find HAY FEVER a bit hard to grasp, both BLITHE SPIRIT and PRIVATE LIVES read extremely, extremely well--so much so that you're likely to find yourself acting them out as you read!  Wonderful fun, and strongly, strongly recommended.	2002-05-30

But at center, Evelyn Waugh's greatest novel (and one of his few non-satirical works) is about religious faith, and how that faith continues to operate in the lives of even those who seem to reject it, and how that faith supports even those who falter badly in it.<br /><br />The story is complex. It is told in the first person by narrator Charles Ryder, who develops a close and possibly homoerotic relationship with artistocrat Sebastian Flyte while the two are students at Oxford.  Seduced by the glamor of Flyte's way of life and the beauty of his ancestrial home at Brideshead, Ryder becomes deeply involved with Flyte's family as well--a Roman Catholic family in which the various members either use their religion to manipulate others or actively rebel against it.  With the passage of time, Sebastian's drinking expands into alcholism--which appears to be fueled by his guilt at rejecting the church, a rejection which may be based on his own uncertain sexuality.  Ryder consequently transfers his affections to Sebastian's sister Julia--but again religion influences their relationship: Julia has made an unfortunate marriage, and although she is willing to engage in an affair with Ryder, she may not be willing to divorce her husband, an act that will cast her completely outside the bounds of her faith.<br /><br />The characters involved in the story are often extremely charming, but they are not necessarily admirable, and the passage of time in the novel nibbles away at their charm in such a way as to expose their flaws; even the narrator, Charles Ryder, gradually emerges as a somewhat second-rate person of dubious integrity.  Even so, there remains a strange element of hope in the novel, a sense of God's grace and mercy even in the face of deliberate affront.  Poetically written with considerable beauty and a sense of lost innocence that haunts the reader, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is a too-often misinterpreted and misunderstood book that demands a thoughtful reading to get down into the marrow of its thematic bones.  Powerful, beautiful, memorable--a book to read and enjoy again and again.

THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD remains one of the most startling novels in the entire murder mystery genre, and it should be very near the top of any murder mystery fan's reading list.<br />Told from the point of view of a village doctor, ACKROYD opens with a suspicious death--and this is followed by the murder of Ackroyd, a wealthy local who learns more about the suspicious death than it is wise to know, and whose death draws Hercule Poirot to investigate.  This is not actually one of Christie's more smoothly written novels; most of the characters (excluding Caroline, the village gossip, who is a delight) seem more than a little flat, the narrative drags a bit here and there, and the plot is extremely tricksy... but the conclusion is a stunner, perhaps the single most famous plot twist of Christie's long and revered career.

It was widely distributed at my school, and the faculty urged the students to read it for an accurate portrait of the horrors of drug use--and read it I did.  At the time I was very, very impressed by the book.  But that was almost thirty years ago.  Today I am 40 years old, and I am a much more critical reader than I was when I was 12.  And my thoughts upon rereading this book are quite different than they were when I first came to it.<br /><br />The obvious issue here is whether or not the book is what it purports to be.  Upon re-reading it, I find myself willing to believe that GO ASK ALICE is indeed the diary of a teenage drug user--but I also think it has been heavily re-written in spots to intensify its anti-drug agenda.  I base this observation on two points.  First, whenever the book describes drugs or their effects, it suddenly changes tone and becomes very, very specific in a way that the other entries are not.  Secondly, the descriptions it offers re the effects of certain drugs are exactly those you would expect of a non-drug-user writing with reference to studies available in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<br /><br />This does not change the fact that this is a good book for young teenagers to read.  The literary merit is zero--but that is not the point; the point is, as it always was, that casual drug use is simply not a good idea, and it places you in a situation where one thing can easily lead to another without the user being aware of the drift or having concious control.  But it is also a book that needs to be read with responsible adult imput, for some of its content may need qualification.  Ultimately, although dated and perhaps not quite as honest as it at first glance seems, it remains a powerful tool in any parent's anti-drug arsenal.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2002-05-25

Like her widely anthologized short story \\"Why I Live at the P.O.,\\" Welty's short novel THE PONDER HEART is written as a monologue, giving the reader the unexpected sensation of sitting across the front porch from Edna Earl herself as she determinedly relates the story of how her eccentric Uncle Daniel unexpectedly found himself on trial for murder in their tiny Mississippi town.<br />THE PONDER HEART is a masterpiece of American humor.  The humor of the novel is not, however, so much in the story (amusing though it is) as in the way it is told.  Edna Earl has a typically Southern knack for turning a colorful phrase, and throughout her narrative she takes us on a tour of the best of Southern venacular, tossing off several memorable comments and laugh-out-loud descriptions on every page--particularly when it comes to white trash Bonnie Lee Peacock, who marries the addlepated Uncle Daniel on a trial basis.  And if you're not Southern enough to completely grasp the definition of \\"white trash,\\" that most Southern of perjoratives, Edna Earl will leave you in no doubt as to what precisely it means.<br />Welty wrote considerably deeper works than THE PONDER HEART--her stunning short stories and the Pulitizer Prize winning novel THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER come quickly to mind--but for pure-dee down home humor Edna Earl, Uncle Daniel, Bonnie Lee, and the Peacock family are hard to beat.  A touching, hilarious, and extremely memorable work that you'll probably return to again and again!  Strongly recommended.	2002-05-16

Inspired by both her archeologist husband and then-recent archeological finds, Christie sets her tale of murder and mayhem in ancient Egypt. Even so, the story remains pure Christie: a long widowed landowner brings the beautiful young woman with whom he has fallen in love to his home--and she quickly upsets the household by manipulating a series of confrontations that so enrage her lover that he threatens to disinherit his children in her favor. Needless to say, murder is not far behind, and one death leads to another and another in what must be one of the highest body counts in any Christie novel.<br />Although Christie spins her tale with considerable historical authority and aplomb, her extremely English tone of voice does not entirely suit her setting, and in this instance the solution to the crimes is actually on the obvious side. Ultimately, DEATH COMES AS THE END is more of an interesting experiment than it is a successful novel and cannot be ranked as among her most successful works--but it is expertly written, and established fans of her work will have a good time with it.	2002-05-15

Although Welty made her reputation with and is best remembered for her remarkable short stories, she also wrote a number of novels, including THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER, for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.<br />As seen in reviews posted here, THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER provokes a very divided response in readers.  This largely due to the nature of the work, which is character rather than plot driven, and which although quite short requires a slow reading in order to develop clearly in mind.  Perhaps more so than in any other work, Welty writes \\"below the surface\\" here: the story itself, which concerns a daughter who returns to her tiny Mississippi home town when her respected father dies, is quite slight--but Welty endows it with a surprising depth of meaning, transforming what would otherwise be pure character study into a sharply focused and deeply moving statement on the nature of love, loss, life, and the passage of time we must all endure.<br />Although written in a deceptively simple style, THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER is the mature work of a master.  Given the nature of the piece, I do not think it can be much appreciated by young adults; one requires the perspective of at least middle age to fully grasp both its delicacy and beauty.  But once that perspective is acquired, THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER should move immediately to the top of every serious reader's list.  Strongly recommended.	2002-05-14

Instead of merely acknowleding that Garland's father was homosexual and that this played a major role in family difficulties, Clarke is extremely explicit on the point; he also delves further into Garland's own sexual escapades with such figures as Artie Shaw, Betty Asher, and Tyrone Power than most biographers have dared, and he gives the fullest portait of the Garland-Rose marriage thus far offered in print.  But when Clarke stumbles, he stumbles badly.  Like many another before him (Anne Edwards is a classic case in point), Clarke tends to rely upon Judy Garland herself as the ultimate authority--and since Garland was notorious for re-engineering the truth to make a good story or to justify her own excesses, this is a serious mistake.  Many of the ensuing errors (such as acceptance of the Garland-perpetuated myth that the \\"Munchkin\\" midgets were drunken deviates) may seem slight, but they raise questions about the depth of Clarke's research.  More damaging to Clarke's credibility, however, is the light in which he casts such figures as Garland's mother, Ethel Milne Gumm, and MGM studio boss Louis B. Mayer, which harken back to Garland's own sometimes hysterical self-justifications rather offering carefully balanced accounts.<br /><br />Ultimately, GET HAPPY seems one third standard mythology, one third gossip column, and one third fact--and as the book progresses one begins to wonder about how much Clarke himself likes Judy Garland either as a person or a performer.  Even so, it does make for an interesting read, at least as long as you don't take it too seriously, and it really should be read in light of more balanced and expert research--again, such as Finch's RAINBOW, which is sadly out of print but still widely available as a used book from various Amazon.com vendors.oes make for an interesting read, at least as long as you don't take it too seriously, and it really should be read in light of more balanced and expert research--again, such as Finch's RAINBOW, which is sadly out of print but still widely available as a used book from various Amazon.com vendors.	2002-05-12

The premise is extremely whimsical, and hardcore mystery fans will find the plots of the \\"Mrs. Murphy\\" series very loose indeed--but Rita Mae Brown has a talent for creating memorable characters and turns of phrase, and her lighter-than-air mystery novels are an enjoyable way to wile away a lazy afternoon or two.<br />MURDER, SHE MEOWED has a particularly transparent plot--but even so it is one of Brown's more interesting entries in the \\"Mrs. Murphy\\" series, reacquainting us with all the Crozet residents (both human and animal) we've come to know and love and introduces one or two new ones as well.  In this particular novel, Brown sets her tale against the snobbish Virginia steeplechase community, and when a jockey of questionable background is found stabbed to death in a stable the roots of the crime may be as close at hand as the local drug dealer or as far removed in time as an old missing person mystery.

The case was never solved, and lingering questions about the crime spelled finish for the careers of the brilliant comic actress Mable Normand and the popular ingenue Mary Miles Minter.  But in Hollywood, old sins cast long shadows: the case continued to be investigated off and on over subsequent decades, providing considerable fodder for the tabolid press.  In time, it became a legend, and in the the late 1960s director King Vidor--who had been acquainted with most of the individuals involved--began his own investigation in hopes of developing the story into a film.<br />Vidor eventually set his findings aside, and after his death biographer Sidney D. Kirkpatrick uncovered his extensive notes on the Taylor case.  The result is A CAST OF KILLERS, a book which purports to solve the case for once and for all.  Although he writes with a somewhat superficial tone, Kirkpatrick spins out his story with considerable conviction.  What emerges is an extremely distasteful portrait of greed.  According to Kirkpatrick, the studios decided to protect themselves even to the extent of implicating innocent parties while the Los Angeles Police Department preferred to extort money from the killer instead of bringing the case to court.  But more disturbing than this is the portrait Kirkpatrick paints a profoundly dysfunctional family, the head of which was dominated by a need for money, fame, and absolute control.<br />Ultimately there is no hard proof for Kirkpatrick's conclusions, but--and in spite of several errors that have crept into the work--he makes an extremely convincing case for their validity.  While A CAST OF KILLERS is far too popular in content to satisfy students of the crime (described as Taylorologists), it is largely in line with current theory re this famous murder, and it makes for a fascinating read.  Recommended.	2002-05-10

One of these children, Jocko, grew up into a singularly undesirable man; constantly involved in legal scrapes, he is the obvious suspect when his adoptive mother is found with her head bashed in by a poker, and he soon convicted.  But two years after his death, a man who could have given Jocko an iron-clad alibi suddenly resurfaces, and the family is suddenly thrown into disarray as the case is reopened.<br />Christie is, as always, extremely expert in her writing, but ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE proves an extremely mechanical effort without more than one or two memorable characters--still, it offers a typically surprising and memorable Christie solution, and that is saying a great deal indeed.  While it does not rank among her finer efforts, both fans and newcomers should enjoy it quite a bit.	2002-05-07

After a certain point, Grimes also relies upon genealogy for a plot twist--and while I grant that she certainly knows a great deal about writing novels and is at least credible on the subject of Poe, her commentary on genealogy will not pass muster with even the mildest amateur genealogist.  In the process we are also treated to chunks of the book the novelist is writing and chunks of the Poe story that may or may not be an elaborate hoax, and by the time the novel winds to its rather tedious conclusion we feel we have read everything except a novel by Martha Grimes.  Which is a great pity indeed.	2002-05-06

In the 1950s there was a famous stage version and still more famous film version, both starring the illustrious Rosalind Russell; in the 1960s there was an extremely popular stage musical starring Angela Lansbury and then a critically disasterous screen musical starring Lucille Ball.  But this is the first, the original: AUNTIE MAME, one the 1950s' most talked-about books, a true runaway bestseller and one of the great classics of American humor.<br />The episodic book concerns an orphaned child, Patrick Dennis, who is sent to live with an aunt he has never before seen in 1920s New York--and the aunt is Mame Dennis, a fast-living, intellectually sharp, and decidedly eccentric woman beset by both the fads and fashions of the day and the money and social connections with which to indulge them.  Although time has rather blunted the actual way in which Patrick Dennis writes (his framing device of a magazine article is more than a little tiresome), it certainly has not blunted the character herself: madcap Mame runs riot through the roaring twenties, goes through largely self-induced hysteria during the Depression, works for the boys during World War II, and along the way gets involves in art movements, theatrical performances, fox hunts, Southern country society, war orphans, a wealthy husband, an Irish poet, a college lover, and most famously her beloved nephew's unfortunate engagement to the shallow and snobbish Gloria Upson.  Each comic disaster is more memorable than the last, and Mame herself lingers in the mind as an inspiration to live life to the fullest no matter the consequences.<br />Fans of the Rosalind Russell film version will quickly realize that Russell has captured the character perfectly; the book, however, is at once less structured and considerably broader than the Russell playscript and film.  Very episodic and considered quite riske for its time, it contains a number of adventures (such as Mame's seduction of one of Patrick's college friends or her introduction of Patrick to the Maddox sisters) that never made it to any performance version.  Both fans of the various plays and films and even the completely uninitiated will adore meeting the sparkling original, certainly one of the greatest comic creations in 20th Century literature. AUNTIE MAME deserves a special place on the shelf of any one who enjoys a range of humor that runs from sly giggles to screaming laughter.

(St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)	Books	4	8	10	N	N	An Unlikely But Enjoyable Frolick	Also published under the title THE BOOMERANG CLUE, Agatha Christie's WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS? is similar to her Tommy and Tuppence novels, for it offers a \\"bright young couple\\" embroiled in an unlikely tale of unexpected murder and constant adventure so smartly paced that one critic subtitled it as \\"the Merry-Go-Round Mystery.\\"<br />Bobby Jones and Lady Frances (Frankie to her friends) are not quite as memorable as Tommy and Tuppence, but they make for an engaging pair just the same, and when their suspicions are aroused re a deadly accident the result is a series of masquerades calculated to lead both Bobby and Frankie--as well as the reader--right up the garden path.  Although there is less \\"mystery\\" more deux ex machina than one normally expects of Christie, the novel is written in high style.  Christie was clearly having a great time with this particular novel, and although it cannot be classed with her great classics most readers will find themselves enjoying the ride.

With all physical evidence gone and Caroline herself dead, Poirot must reach back in time through the memories of the five surviving witnesses in an effort to either confirm the original conviction or expose the true killer.<br />FIVE LITTLE PIGS is one of Christie's most intriguing novels, for the personalities of the murdered husband and convicted wife are evoked entirely through the memories of those who knew them--and to very powerful effect.  The characterizations are extremely vivid, the story offers an unusual degree of atmosphere for a Christie novel, and the solution to the crime is among Christie's most astonishing and satisfying.  Thoroughly enjoyable in every possible way.	2002-05-03

One of America's most frequently anthologized writers, Welty's distinctly Southern tone and the fineness of her over-all work makes her the only regional author whose reputation consistently challenges that of William Faulkner.<br />This particular collection of Welty's short stories includes all works previously collected under the titles A CURTAIN OF GREEN and THE WIDE NET, which were her first and second published short story volumes, written in the 1930s and 1940s.  The stories from the former are widely known, and include such favorites as \\"The Petrified Man,\\" \\"Keela, the Outcast Indian Maiden,\\" \\"Why I Live at the P.O.,\\" and \\"The Worn Path.\\"  Although less well known, stories from the latter are equally fine, and include such titles as \\"First Love,\\" \\"The Wide Net,\\" and \\"Livvy.\\"<br />Welty was blessed with a talent for writing from the inside of the character, and in reading her work one consistently feels that one is not so much reading Welty as the writings of the characters she presents--writings rendered with superlative, memorable imagery.  But although Welty's work generally consists of character portrait rather than plot-driven material and maintains a stylistically consistent tone, it is remarkably varied, ranging from the outrageously comic to the deeply touching to the profoundly disquieting.<br />Of particular interest to modern readers is the way in which Welty, who wrote primarily during the era of segregation, addresses race in her work.  In one sense, she does not address it at all, for her work is not issue-oriented; at the same time, however, certain aspects of her work (such as characters who occasionally use the 'n' word, which even in the South of this era carried certain implications about the mentality and social class of the person who used it) indicate her awareness of the slow-boil hidden beneath the surface of Southern society.  Although it is not included in this particular collection, those interested in Welty's work would do well to read her 1960s story \\"Where Is The Voice Coming From?,\\" a fearsome portrait of violent racism in action, for Welty's ultimate position on the matter.ertain implications about the mentality and social class of the person who used it) indicate her awareness of the slow-boil hidden beneath the surface of Southern society.

Garland's family, friends, associates, many of those who actually worked on the television series, and later biographers have been extremely, extremely critical of this book, denouncing it as one-sided, self-serving, and mean-spirited.<br />In light of several later biographies and at least one unbiased and exhaustively researched book on the CBS series itself, those accusations would seem to be true--but the main thing that undermines Torme's description of both Judy Garland and her CBS series is the current availability of the series itself, which has been released to the home market in VHS and DVD.  There is little doubt that Garland was tempestuous, drug-ridden, and often difficult to work with during this period--but the actual series itself shows little of undisciplined chaos Torme describes; some moments are weak, some moments are strong, and some moments are awe-inspiring, but all in all the actual series is surprisingly innovative when seen during the context of its era.  It is also worth mentioning that many of Garland's most acclaimed recording releases have been drawn from her performances for this particular series.<br />That said, this does not change the fact that THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RAINBOW is an interesting read.  Torme is clearly angry about the whole thing (he eventually sued Garland's production company, and the book includes transcripts of Garland's depositions during the suit), and he adopts a snide tone that makes the work intriguing--and no doubt his account is accurate in the sense that it conveys the situation as he himself saw it.  But to say it lacks any degree of balance would be the understatement of the century: Garland emerges as a has-been harridan and Torme inevitably comes up smelling like a rose.<br />As one person who worked on Garland's television series later remarked, \\"as a historian Mel Torme is a great singer.\\"  Because of the complete lack of balance and the self-serving and mean-spirited nature of the work (all the more deadly for being hidden behind a facade of affection), I do not recommend this particular book to some one casually interested in Garland; on the other hand, those with a serious interest in the artist who can approach the work in light of unbiased accounts of Garland, Torme, and the history of The Judy Garland Show will find it an interesting sidelight on what was arguably one of Garland's most artistically productive eras.  Final word: you'll need to take it with more than a few grains of salt, so keep the shaker handy.tury: Garland emerges as a has-been harridan and Torme inevitably comes up smelling like a rose.<br />As one person who worked on Garland's television series later remarked, \\"as a historian Mel Torme is a great singer.\\"  Because of the complete lack of balance and the self-serving and mean-spirited nature of the work (all the more deadly for being hidden behind a facade of affection), I do not recommend this particular book to some one casually interested in Garland; on the other hand, those with a serious interest in the artist who can approach the work in light of unbiased accounts of Garland, Torme, and the history of The Judy Garland Show will find it an interesting sidelight on what was arguably one of Garland's most artistically productive eras.

Garland's family, friends, and associates had seen them come and go, and they knew all too well that Deans was just one more flash in the pan in Garland's increasingly erratic life--and not a particularly attractive one at that.  But there would be no \\"next time.\\"  Not long after their marriage, Garland died of an accidental drug overdose, leaving Mickey Deans as the widower of note.<br />Published in 1972, WEEP NO MORE MY LADY was the second book about Garland to follow her 1969 death, and in it Mickey Deans and co-author Ann Pinchot offer a general biography of Garland along with a portrait of the brief marriage.  The Garland children are on record as saying the book is extremely self-serving, painting a \\"happily-ever-after\\" vision of a small-time promoter who hitched his wagon to a fading but still powerful star--and it does seem likely that Deans, who vanished from the public eye as quickly as he appeared, ground out this book as a quick cash-in on Garland's then-recent death.  But all the same, it is not entirely fair to completely trash the book itself.<br />As general biography, WEEP NO MORE MY LADY offered nothing new even in 1972, and in light of several later, much more deeply researched works is at best extremely niave.  It is also true that Deans puts an extremely sentimental gloss on his marriage to Garland--a gloss so thick that it becomes as sticky as half-melted all-day sucker.  It is extremely important to read between the lines here--and to read in knowledge of later, more factual and well-substantiated accounts.  But unlike the similar OVER THE RAINBOW WITH JUDY GARLAND ON THE DAWN PATROL by Mel Torme, there is nothing mean-spirited about the book, and although Deans and Pinchot obviously romanticize and glamourize to the nth degree they do occasionally offer interesting sidelights into the last days of a truly great talent.

Although she produced several critically acclaimed novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER, Welty achieved her greatest fame through mastery of that most difficult of all literary forms, the short story.<br />Welty's skill with short stories is amazing, for she possessed a talent that combined a remarkable ear for the spoken word, meticulous observation of physical world, and the truly mysterious ability to slip almost effortlessly into the very marrow of the characters she depicts. Her comic stories are perhaps best known to the public in general, but she is equally at home with provocative and unsettling material, and although her tales are most often firmly rooted in America's deep south they have a sense of humanity that transcends the limitations of purely regional literature.<br />In addition to stories previously collected under the titles A CURTAIN OF GREEN, THE WIDE NET, THE GOLDEN APPLES, and THE BRIDE OF THE INNISFALLEN, this Library of America publication also includes the independently published stories \\"Where Is the Voice Coming From?\\" and \\"The Demonstrators,\\" nine selected essays, and Welty's memoir ONE WRITER'S BEGINNINGS.

The most successful of these portions is the first. Nordan effortlessly captures the eccentricties of growing up in post-war in prose that bespeaks the South in every aspect, and if BOY WITH LOADED GUN consisted of this portion only it would still find a special niche among the best of Southern belles lettres.<br />But life does not end with childhood, and the remainder of the book follows Nordon's life as it first unravels and then as he attempts (with many a set back) to knit it up again.  Just as Nordan was unable to organize these portions of his life in the living, so is he unable to organize them on the page, and although the work remains stylistically flawless it becomes so extremely episodic that it lacks focus. After making such a long and frequently painful journey through Nordan's life, I expected him to offer a cummulative statement that would bring the diverse elements of his memoir into focus as the book neared its conclusion. But there is none--and this undercuts any sense of purpose the book might have. It is beautifully written, but there seems little point to it beyond writing beautifully.<br />Several [people] have suggested that Nordan is the \\"next William Faulkner.\\" I can only assume these [people] have never read William Faulkner, for neither Nordan's style nor his material is remotely like anything Faulkner ever wrote.

If you thought the vulgar humor in such films as PORKY'S and AMERICAN PIE was a modern phenomena, you're in for a shock: both are fairly mild in comparison with the works of Rabelais, which plumb the depths of human crassness in full Renaissance style.  Writing before European authors had codified the novel as a form, Rabelais presents a series of very episodic tales about the adventures of the giant Gargantua, his son Pantagruel, and Pantagruel's trickster friend Panurge--and the three vomit, belch, fart, and engage in a number of equally distasteful bodily functions across page after page in some of the funniest writings found in the whole of Western literature.<br />But unlike contemporary bad-taste comedy, Rabelais is hardly willing to let his reader go with just a laugh.  There is sharp intelligence behind his naughty laughter--and he directs his considerable wit at everything from education to fashionable society in page after page of unspeakably hilarious incident.  (My own favorite passage concerns the trick Panurge plays upon the fashionable, church-going lady who spurns his attentions; it never fails to throw me into near-hysterical laughter.)  Vividly written and extremely memorable, GARGANTUA AND PANTAGRUEL is the sort of stuff they don't teach in highschool... and more's the pity: it would probably convert more students to the classics than all the Romantics combined.  Truly serious scholars should, of course, compare various translations, but the Cohen translation will do the trick for the more casual reader.  Strongly recommended.	2002-04-29

Linnet Ridgeway has everything: beauty, brains, unspeakable wealth... and Jacquline de Bellefort's boyfriend, a handsome but simple man that Linnet stole away from her friend and married.  And now Jacquiline is in hot pursuit, unexpectedly appearing to embarrass the newlyweds at various points along their journey.  Linnet and her husband attempt to escape by secretly booking passage on a tourist ship traveling the Nile--but Jacquiline is one step ahead... and murder is not far behind.<br />This is Christie writing near the peak of her skills, offering us a complex tale of emotional fury, considerable atmosphere, and endless intrigue played out by a truly eccentric cast of characters that include society snobs, underhanded servants, neurotic writers, unsavory businessmen, a communist, and just possibly one or two jewel thieves for good measure.  Unlike the more famous ORIENT EXPRESS, which offers us a meticulous and extremely cool crime, DEATH ON THE NILE veers into considerable emotional melodrama--and although Christie walks a very fine line here, she succeeds in bringing it off with tremendous flair.  And when it comes, the solution to the crime is one of her most memorable and successful, combining the logic and startle-factor that have made Christie legendary in the genre.  A brilliant piece of work from start to finish.	2002-04-27

When called into the case by a local doctor, Hercule Poirot discovers that Elinor behaves exactly as if she is guilty of the crime.  Nonetheless, he agrees to investigate... and as Poirot works to uncover the truth, he finds that virtually everything about the crime indicates that Elinor did indeed commit the crimes--a circumstance which, almost perversely, makes him begin to question the guilt others have taken for granted.<br />This is one of Christie's least known but most effective novels, a work that deserves to be ranked with the likes of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, THE ABC MURDERS, and A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED. The characters are among her most vivid, the story has an unpretentious atmosphere, and the solution is both absolutely reasonable and absolutely unexpected. Christie writes with considerable clarity, and the simplicity of her approach makes the story all the more effective. An impressive work, sure to please both old fans and newcomers alike; recommended.	2002-04-24

The incident sets in motion a chain of unexpected events: the property owner, who is in possession of a glove made by William Shakespeare, rennovates the theatre and installs the young man as artistic director--who in turn writes a play inspired by the Shakespeare glove--which is in turn displayed to promote the play. But with such a valuable artifact in the mix, theft and murder are inevitable.<br />Marsh writes this particular novel with remarkable brilliance--so much so that the slightness of the story is actually rather beside the point. KILLER DOLPHIN is a remarkably well-written work, and should be required reading for all Marsh fans.	2002-04-24

It is written in an effortless and easy-to-read style, and the clinic's experiences with everything from runaway pigs to lavishly spoiled lapdogs makes for laugh-out-loud fun.  Who could forget Tristan's battle with a savage sow or the dog that howled?  How about the hens that flew the coop or Tricki-Woo's birthday party?  Or the car with no brakes or the cow that would never get up again?  Herriot's comic tales can easily make you laugh until you cry.<br />But ALL CREATURES isn't only about laughter.  There is also the hard work of farming and the simple integrity of those who struggle to survive on the land, where the loss of a cow can mean the difference between surviving another year and financial disaster.  There is also the sorrow at the loss of a treasured companion.  And through it all, from the wildly comic to the poignant and touching, there is always, always the story of the relationship between man and animal, joyously told.  Easily one of the most completely enjoyable books I've ever read, and very strongly recommended.	2002-04-22

But circumstances override his intentions when an Englishwoman on their train suffers an attack of appendicitus requiring immediate surgery, the Allens agree to take charge of her, and the only qualified surgeon in the area is one working with the drug ring.  Allen's cover is quickly blown, and in order to distract him from further investigation the drug ring members kidnap his child.<br /><br />SPINSTERS IN JEOPARDY is quite unlike most Marsh novels for it is not a mystery per se; the criminals are immediately apparent, and although there is a somewhat covert mystery afoot Marsh relies almost exclusively upon suspense and her knack for creating vividly-painted characters to substain interest.  While this is certainly enough to make the novel entertaining, it is not enough to make this particular novel--the plot of which relies on coincidence upon coincidence--as memorable as her other work.  Even so, the book is quite enjoyable in a Hitchcockian sort of way, reminding one a bit of the director's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.  Agatha Christie fans will also recognize that Marsh uses a plot a device similar to Christie's THE 4:50 FROM PADDINGTON, in which a passenger unexpectedly witnesses a murder through a train window.  A pleasant read, but not among the first rank of Marsh novels.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2002-04-21

Why?  Because it is a showcase for Marsh's skill in creating and presenting memorable characters, and this tale of lost treasure and multiple murder not only abounds with them, it is told with unusual wit even for the always witty Marsh.<br />The story concerns the extremely rich Sybil Foster--who is also very much the hypocondriac.  But on this occasion she has good reason to feel particularly under the weather: she is about to run afoul of her extremely unattractive step-son by her late first husband, who is determined to find an extremely valuable stamp his father concealed somewhere on the estate shortly before his death.  Rather than cope with \\"Charmless Claude,\\" she takes her self off to Greengages, a private rest home popular with the wealthy seeking a week's relaxion.  But instead of relaxation, Sybil finds one crisis after another--and ultimately mysterious death.<br />This is one of Marsh's most brilliantly written novels, dripping with atmosphere, and of the many memorable portraits it offers the character Verity Preston--Sybil's sometime friend--is Marsh writing at the top of her skill.  As noted above, savvy readers will spot the killer before Inspector Allen does, but GRAVE MISTAKE is so beautifully done that even those who do figure it out shouldn't mind in the least.  A personal favorite, and strongly recommended.	2002-04-19

Scott Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker... and Agatha Christie.  At her best, Agatha Christie's short stories are the equal of any by these more literary writers--and THE THIRTEEN PROBLEMS is very much Agatha Christie at her best. The individual stories are loosely tied together as something of a party game: after dinner each guest is required to present a mystery to which he or she knows the solution and the other guests must puzzle it out.  The concept produces a chatty sort format that is both entertaining and perfectly suited to Agatha Christie's demure yet remarkably sharp Miss Marple--who disconcerts the others by inevitably solving the crime.<br />In addition to Miss Marple, the storytellers include a number of always welcome re-occurring characters such as Mr. and Mrs. Bantry, Miss Marple's nephew Raymond West, and Sir Henry Clithering.  Each of the stories is as memorable as anything Christie wrote in novel form, and although you can easily read any of the stories out of sequence the dinner party concept gives the collection a unified quality which nonetheless escapes the more demanding requirements of tackling a full-length novel.<br />This is the ideal bedside book, for you need read no more than a single story--drop off to sleep--and then return again to the next story at your leisure.  At the same time it will satisfy even the most hardcore Christie fans; every one is sure to have their own favorite tale (mine is \\"The Herb of Death\\") and serious Christie readers will enjoy spotting plot devices that Christie later elaborated into full-length novels.  Very, very enjoyable and highly recommended.	2002-04-18

Most of THE SEWING CIRCLE concerns the rumors that swirled around Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, and the various women who moved in their circle; in writing of this group Madsen has done his homework and the result is quite interesting.  On the other hand, Madsen makes little effort to explore the lives of such figures as Agnes Moorehead--and then, completely out of the blue, attempts to posit Judy Garland as a lesbian, which is such a leap that it makes you begin to question his portraits of everyone else as well.<br />That aside, although Madsen's actual style is good enough, his structure is not, and THE SEWING CIRCLE jumps here, there, and everywhere in an effort to catch the reader by surprise.  Still, the book is entertainingly written.  Recommended for a rainy day read, but keep your grains of salt ready.	2002-04-18

Novels from this early period are hit and miss--and MURDER AT THE VICARAGE, which introduces the famous Miss Marple, might best be described as a bit of both.<br /><br />VICARAGE offers the story of the widely unpopular Col. Protheroe, who seems determined to vex every one he encounters--including his daughter from a former marriage and his current wife, the latter of which has undertaken a liaison with a local artist.  One evening the Colonel pays a call to vicarage only to find the Vicar out on a call... and while waiting is shot dead under what seem impossible circumstances.  No sooner is the body discovered than people who could not possibly have committed the crime begin to confess, and the Vicar and his neighbor, the meddlesome Miss Marple, form a somewhat uneasy alliance to ferret out the truth.<br /><br />The Miss Marple of this particular novel is not the character we know from later books; although the outlines of the character are well established, she is not greatly sympathetic and she lacks the disconcerting twinkle found in such works as THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY and A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED.  Moreover, the other characters, the setting, and the plot seem extremely stiff.  The solution, when it comes, is also rather gimmicky in a way which Christie cannot yet make entirely plausible.  I would not recommend this particular Christie to newcomers--but I do recommend it longtime fans, who will enjoy seeing how Christie developed the character of Miss Marple and how she herself evolved as a writer, particularly since the outline of the plot is a device to which she would return with considerably greater effect in later and more substantial novels.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2002-04-17

And the ensuing investigation proves problematic in more ways than one.<br /><br />As usual, Martha Grimes writes beautifully, presenting us with a host of likely and unlikely suspects ranging from an eccentric romance novelist to a near-hysterical book dealer to a woman who greatly enjoys her dubious reputation--and considerable humor in the form of Aunt Agatha, a plaster pig, a bicycle, and chamber pots.  But fascinating as her prose is, the sheer complexity of her story seems to run away with her in this particular novel, which piles character upon character and event upon event in a truly dizzying sort way.<br /><br />Perhaps more to the point, this particular work deals with the thematic thread of to what degree we actually know people as individuals, the plot relies heavily upon coincidence, and Grimes juggles a great many balls to conceal the killer's hand.  Whether or not readers feel these balls all fetch up together in logical order is a matter of opinion; clearly some consider this one of her most spectacular finishes while others find it frustratingly vague.  For myself, I found the novel requires more concentration than one expects of a murder mystery, and while I thought the device was very clever I felt the conclusion lacked drama and consequently doesn't entirely come off.  While I do recommend the novel to long-time Martha Grimes fans, I would hesitate to recommend it to newcomers, who might find BLADEBONE's deliberate ambiguity a bit off-putting.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2002-04-16

Needless to say, the situation is ripe for comedy--particularly when St. Rose of Lima's weekly bingo game, at which most of the townfolk meet without fail, begins a move toward a big-pot game known as \\"Blackout\\" and Juts and Wheeze, both in their eighties, begin to compete over the same man.<br />BINGO is not one of Rita Mae Brown's most literary efforts--it is too loosely structured for that--but it is surely one of her most beloved novels, effectively juggling eccentric characters and ridiculous situations with Brown's own take on modern morality.  A particular joy are the supporting characters, which are presented with tremendous appeal: Mr. Pierre, the town's effeminate hairdresser; the massively overweight Verna BonTon and her endless family; the feuding law enforcement officers; the yuppie cub reporter--all presented with considerable aplomb and charm and sharpness.  Everything adds up to one of the most hilarious things you'll ever read, a real can't-put-it-down, laugh-out-loud book that will have you sitting up half the night trying to silence your hoots lest you wake the neighbors.  The setting, characters, and one-liners are extremely memorable, funny, and remarkably honest, and this is one you'll return again and again.  I know I have!  Recommended.	2002-04-14

In doing so, she literally pioneered screen acting technique as we now know it, and it would be extremely difficult to over-estimate her artistic impact.<br />Although Gish worked with numerous directors over the course of her extremely long career, she is most specifically remembered for her association with D.W. Griffith, whose pioneering silent films firmly established what Gish would describe as &quot;the grammar&quot; of modern cinema.  As one might guess from its title, a good portion of THE MOVIES, MR. GRIFFITH, &amp; ME is devoted to Griffith, and it offers a first-hand account of Griffith, the challenges he faced, and the evolution of film from extremely primitive one-reels into a sophistocated art form during the 1910s; those interested in film history will be particularly fascinated by Gish's accounts of the filming of two landmark silents, BIRTH OF A NATION and INTOLERANCE.<br />Other star autobiographies frequently turn into kiss and tell sagas, but Gish is extremely respectful of those she describes and discreet about her private life to a remarkable degree; consequently, THE MOVIES, MR. GRIFFITH, &amp; ME is less the story of a life than it is the story of a career.  But what a career it was!  The tone of the book is at once lady-like but extremely readable, and even those who have little interest in the early days of the motion picture industry will find it fascinating stuff.  This is an extremely readable book--but it is also an extremely important historical document as well, and the fact that it is out of print is appalling.  If you have any interest in the history of motion pictures, you cannot afford to miss this book.  Seek it out and keep it handy on the shelf, for it is strongly, strongly recommended.ommended.	2002-04-12

Convinced that she has seen the original subject, she decides to track it down--and when she does, she stumbles into stories of a series of unsolved child murders that occurred in the district many years before... and some one is displeased enough about her curiosity to become lethal.<br /><br />This is the best of Christie's Tommy and Tuppence novels, a neat mixture of the characters' bright and witty personalities, an interesting story that takes several unexpected turns, and a surprisingly charged atmosphere that haunts the memory.  While most serious critics dismiss the Tommy and Tuppence books, BY THE PRICKINGS OF MY THUMBS is the equal of any of Christie's best work, and long-time fans and newcomers alike should find it a thoroughly enjoyable--and unexpectedly disquieting--read.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2002-04-10

One of the most famous of these tales concerns Paul Bern, an MGM producer, who was found dead of a gunshot wound in his Beverly Hills some two months after his marriage to Jean Harlow.  Word quickly spread that Bern was sexually inadequate and he had taken his life when even marriage to Hollywood's reigning sex goddess failed to arouse him.  His death was quickly ruled a suicide and that was that.<br />Or rather, that would have been that except for one little thing: the whispered rumor Paul Bern was murdered.  Over the decades that whisper has enticed a great many writers, but none approach the subject with such dogged determination as Samuel Marx and Joyce Vanderveen.  Making use of Marx's insider connections (he was an MGM story editor), the two piece together a somewhat speculative but extremely credible tale of insanity, bigamy, police corruption, studio power, murder, and suicide to considerable effect.  The cast of characters in this 1930s scandal are fascinating in and of themselves, and although the style in which it is written is a bit simplistic DEADLY ILLUSIONS makes for a great rainy-day read; fans of true crime, Hollywood scandal, and Jean Harlow will find it a must have.

She accordingly puts through a call to old friend Hercule Poirot, who drops in on the proceedings to discover that some one has turned the game into reality.<br />DEAD MAN'S FOLLY is not among Christie's better known works, and in truth it does not rank among her great classics.  Even so, it has its charms, particularly in the form of Ariadne Oliver, a somewhat frazzled, absent-minded, and eccentric character clearly intended as a parody of mystery novelists in general and Christie herself in particular.  The novel itself is nicely written and offers Christie's usual clever twist at the end.  An enjoyable read for fans of the genre!	2002-04-09

The great, on-going issue surrounding the book is whether or not Christina Crawford's allegations of child abuse are true. This is a matter of heated debate, and those who actually knew Joan Crawford are sharply divided in their reaction--which, given her love-her-or-hate-her persona is hardly surprising. Whatever your actual opinion may be, at the end of the day every one must acknowledge at least one thing: MOMMIE DEAREST is extremely one-sided.<br />This is not to imply that child abuse can be excused under any circumstance, but the fact is that MOMMIE DEAREST doesn't place the abusive behavior it claims to expose in any legitimate context. Joan Crawford was herself a savagely abused, uneducated child who took control of her life and built a career that had few equals; it is hardly surprising, therefore, that she herself might have been an abusive parent with an almost hysterical need to control everything and everyone around her. But all we really learn of Joan Crawford from MOMMIE DEAREST is that she was controlling and abusive, for the book is a savage attack that reduces its target to something as one-dimensional as any 1930s shop-girl romance that Joan Crawford ever played.<br />Perhaps the single most regrettable thing about MOMMIE DEAREST is that it stands in the way of a legitimate biography that might get at the complete truth of Joan Crawford, who she was behind the movie star mask, and why she was the person she ultimately became. A thorough inspection and interpretation of Crawford's life from a disinterested and intelligent point of view would provide a very welcome balance to Christina Crawford's extremely sordid yet perversely fascinating tale--but MOMMIE DEAREST has so colored public thinking about Joan Crawford that it now seems impossible for any one to reach beyond it to the full truth.<br />In a literary sense, MOMMIE DEAREST has zero merit. Christina Crawford (or her ghost-writer, if some rumors are to be believed) is a sloppy writer with little style and still less sense of grammar and structure. Even so, and regardless of whether or not you believe any or all of Christina Crawford's allegations, it is a compelling read, for it appeals to the same animal instinct that forces us to gawk at horrific car wrecks: once you begin to read the book, your need to keep going becomes compulsive.

But no sooner does Poirot walk out of the office than death walks in--and the result is a complicated tale of possible suicide, certain murder, missing suspects, and political intrigue.<br />Christie is always at her best when working a tightly structured plot, but although enjoyable (how can you resist Poirot at the dentist?) SHOE is not among her best efforts. The novel begins as very tightly-plotted, then suddenly flies in a dozen different directions at midpoint.  Christie has considerable difficulty recapturing the different strands for her conclusion--and for once her solution fails to impress.  Worth reading, certainly, but old fans and newcomers alike may be a bit disappointed with the end result.	2002-04-08

In this case, the victim is a French money lender of somewhat dubious repute and the murder occurs directly under the nose of an air-sick Hercule Poirot and seemingly in the most incredibly improbable manner imaginable.<br />In addition to one of Christie's most effective jaw-dropping plots, the book is extremely witty, sometimes almost to the point of parody.  Christie frequently mocked mystery writers who found ridiculous ways in which to dispatch the victim, and here she not only presents us with an impossible murder, she offers us exactly such a novelist as one the primary suspects!  But in typical Christie fashion all is not as it seems: there are numerous twists to the fast-paced tale--and only the most astute reader will be unsurprised by her solution.  Extremely enjoyable, clever, lots of fun, and highly recommended.	2002-04-06

Needless to say, a number of kettles soon begin to boil...  And murder is the result!<br />Well read mystery fans will probably spot the killer on the basis of previous experience, but DEATH AND THE DANCING FOOTMAN offers one of Marsh's better plots--and as usual she creates a vividly drawn cast of characters and presents her tale with considerable style and plenty of wit.  Long standing fans will enjoy it and newcomers will be converted!  Recommended.	2002-04-04

Her drug use served to intensify her emotional problems, distorted her personality, ruined her career, and ultimately took her life.  These are facts, and any Garland biography that attempts to gloss over them does a disservice to its subject, who deserves the dignity of truth.  But Sheridan Morley and Ruth Leon's JUDY GARLAND: BEYOND THE RAINBOW does not simply meet these facts, it turns them into superficial tabloid trash complete with pat explantions and superficial interpretations; worse still, the text is riddled with factual inaccuracy, relies upon rumor and mean-spirited speculation, and makes no attempt to place Garland's difficulties in perspective with the other aspects of her life.<br />I can think of no other Garland text, including the absolutely abominable biography by Anne Edwards, that so ill-serves its own subject.  It is filled with unverified and self-serving gossip delivered in such a nasty tone that one wonders how Morley and Leon manage to sleep at night.  If you wish to read a legitimate portrait of Garland, I recommend you seek out Christopher Finch's meticulously researched and elegantly written RAINBOW: THE STORMY LIFE OF JUDY GARLAND (sadly, now out of print) or Gerald Frank's exhaustive JUDY instead--and avoid this piece of coffee table trash as you would the plague.	2002-04-03

Agatha Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE should be very close to the top of any mystery fan's &#34;must read list.&#34;  The novel concerns a group of ten previously unacquainted people who are lured via various pretexts to Indian Island, a resort home off the coast of Devon--and are promptly accused by their unseen host of having escaped punishment for past crimes.  Cut off from the world and fighting rising panic, they scramble to unmask the killer even as their number is reduced in macabre accordance with the &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34; nursey rhyme displayed in rooms throughout the house.<br /><br />Agatha Christie was already famous when AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (also known under the title TEN LITTLE INDIANS) was published--but this book put her career well over the top: nothing like it had seen before, it proved a sensation, and writers and film-makers continue to use Christie's basic idea to this very day.  Some critics argue the novel is mechanical rather than organic, but I say if this is mechanical, let's have more of it!  It is truly a can't-put-it-down, non-stop read, a spectacular turn by the genre's single most celebrated author.<br /><br />The success of the novel inspired Christie to adapt it for the stage, where it was a tremendous success, and there have been several film versions (most notably the 1940s Rene Clair-directed AND THEN THERE WERE NONE) over the years.  If you know the story only from stage and film versions, however, you are in for a surprise.  Christie felt the novel's conclusion did not translate well to the stage, so she re-wrote it--and most film versions follow the stage script, not the novel.  But whether you've seen the play and films or not, get ready for a shock!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2002-04-01

Her detective, reporter James Qwilleran, investigates crimes with the aid of his Siamese cats--and the solutions to the crime inevitably rest more upon intution than actual deduction.  While the premise sounds farfetched, Braun's work is actually less fanciful than you might expect, and she presents her eccentric characters and stories with great charm.<br />THE CAT WHO SMELLED A RAT finds Moose County, a place 500 miles north of everywhere, in the midst of a serious winter drought: lack of snowfall has turned the county into a tinderbox, and mysterious fires of uncertain origin have the residents on edge--but when a fire-spotter is murdered while on patrol Qwill begins to suspect there is more going on than juvenile-inspired arson. In addition to a few new characters, RAT features all the characters fans of the series have come to know and love, and as usual Braun makes our visit with Qwill &amp; Co. a thoroughly enjoyable diversion.  Recommended for fans and newcomers alike.	2002-03-30

Even though I was then in my late teens my ultra-respectable mother disapproved of me reading it--but one day, when I left the book open on the coffee table, I came in to find my mother engrossed in it and she wouldn't give it back until she had read it cover to cover.  From time to time I asked what she thought about it.  \\"VULGAR TRASH!\\" she would say.  She read every word.  You couldn't have beaten her off that book with a stick!<br />Now, some reviewers try to attach high-flown interpretations to this novel, and some of those intrepretations may even have a little validity.  But the real reason any one reads VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is because it really IS vulgar trash--and even now, more than thirty years later and although there are much more explicit novels available, VALLEY OF THE DOLLS remains the BEST vulgar-trash-novel going.  Jacqueline Susann wasn't much of a writer but she was a born storyteller, and her heavy-handed style suits this story of three lovely young women who hit post-WWII New York with innocent dreams and ambitions--only to become victims of a meat-grinder entertainment industry, too much sleeping around with the wrong men, and pill-popping hell.  In the process, Susann unexpectedly creates a surprisingly effective social document of the late 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s--a period in which women's roles underwent a profound change.<br />Susann, who knew the New York entertainment scene inside out, based many of her characters on real people (does any one out there NOT know that Neely O'Hara is based on Judy Garland and Helen Lawson based on Ethel Merman?), and that makes the novel even more fun to read.  But you don't have to play guessing games to enjoy the book: VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is loud, brash, common, brazen, vulgar trash that you simply cannot put down.  Over the passing years I've read it at least three times. And my mother read it twice!	2002-03-07

White is absolutely nothing like O'Connor, whose humor was extremely dark and often brutal, and while often touching her work could scarcely be described as particularly deep; you will not be provoked to think deep thoughts.  But this is not a criticism of White or her work; the lady has created a niche for herself that is uniquely her own, and she fills it extremely well indeed.<br />MAMA MAKES UP HER MIND is a collection of very short essays of the type White and other essayists have popularized on national public radio: most run two to three pages, and I don't believe the longest piece ran more than five pages at most.  They are bites of eccentric character, local color, and regional humor with an often laugh-out-loud quality. As you might expect, the subject of many of these essays is Mama, and when writing about her mother, Aunt Bell, or the other Southern eccentrics that populate her world White is at her most successful and most memorable.  White is less successful, however, when she herself is the main focus of her writings, and although these particular essays remain enjoyable they seem to lack the same sense of purpose found in her other pieces.  Even so, MAMA MAKES UP HER MIND will entertain from cover to cover with its wry and winsome commentary on &quot;the dangers of Southern living,&quot; and any one who enjoys regional humor expertly conveyed will find tremendous enjoyment in this particular book.  Recommended.	2002-02-26

Written in the 1920s, it effectively captures the \\"anything goes\\" quality of the era through both its outlandish story and its leading characters: Tommy Beresford and Tuppence Cowley, two \\"bright young things\\" who find themselves without jobs in the wake of World War I and who casually advertise their services as \\"young adventurers.\\"  The absurdity of the story, which concerns a kidnapped American survivor of the ill-fated Lusitania in possession of important dipolmatic papers, combines with the lighthearted personalities of Tommy and Tuppence in a very enjoyable way, and although some may dismiss it as too lightweight an effort to rank among Christie's finest, most will find it very amusing and extremely charming in an purely escapist way.<br />On a purely personal note, THE SECRET ADVERSARY was the first Christie novel I ever read.  As I recall, I was about twelve years old, I thought it was tremendous good fun, and even these many years later I still occasionally return to it for the innocent charm of its witty characters as they romp through 1920s London on their ridiculous, funny, and extremely entertaining spree.  It is nonsense of course, but no less enjoyable for it.  Lots of fun!	2002-02-18

Books	4	9	9	N	N	Enjoyable Spy Thriller	When one thinks of Agatha Christie, one usually thinks of novels in which a sharp-minded detective--such as Hercule Poirot or Jane Marple--unravels a tightly plotted puzzle from the comfortable safety of an arm chair.  But Christie sometimes defies this concept of her work with a spy-thriller, and N OR M?, set during the early days of World War II, is among her best efforts in that direction.<br />The novel re-introduces husband and wife Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, characters Christie originally created for the much earlier spy-thriller THE SECRET ADVERSARY--and they are among her most immediately likable protagonists: quick witted, snappy, and unwilling to sit in an armchair when they can be up and doing things.  Although they have been long out of the espionage game, when rumors indicate that one of Hitler's most trusted agents has arrived in England. they are sent to a small coastal boarding house in an effort to unmask the spy who might be hiding among the apparently innocent residents.<br />Readers will enjoy becoming reacquainted with Tommy and Tuppence, who Christie presents with considerable charm--and unlike the other novels in which they appear N OR M? is as much mystery as pure adventure: the book contains one of Christie's trademark twists at the conclusion.  Although somewhat mild by the standards of her more famous novels, Christie endows the tale with a subtle sense of menace that serves it well; fans will enjoy the book, and newcomers will have a good time too.	2002-02-11

Bunchy is quick to identify the blackmailer--but just as the blackmail plot seems about to unravel murder steps in, and Allen must not only uncover the blackmailer but a killer as well.<br />As is often the case in a Marsh novel, some readers will spot the killer long before the book's finish--but as typical of Marsh, getting there is most of the fun.  A number of favorites return in this novel, including painter Agatha Troy, previously introduced in ARTISTS IN CRIME, and Allen's charming mother; the novel also includes a number of romantic subplots that Marsh handles with considerable effectiveness.  Neither newcomers nor old fans will be disappointed; recommended.	2002-02-04

Brown's mystery novels have always been more about funny characters than plot, but this particular novel pretty much throws plot completely out the window.<br />CAT ON THE SCENT finds Mary &quot;Harry&quot; Harristeen (the young postmistress of tiny Crozet, Virginia) and her friends (both human and animal) drawn into a series of mysterious deaths that may or may not have something to do with a proposed reservoir.  As usual, the writing is bright and the characters (including the felines Mrs. Murphy and Pewter and canine Tee Tucker) are entertaining... but on this occasion Brown seems to be straining her concept of animal characters, the overall novel seems unfocused, and many readers will find the conclusion frustrating. Mildly enjoyable, but not greatly memorable.	2002-01-24

But even so, Brown's talent for creating entertaining, likable characters makes for an extremely enjoyable read, and if you're able to accept the premise and overlook the plot's foolishness you'll have an extremely good time.	2002-01-22

Novel	When a highly religious and widely respected churchman is found with his neck broken on his own front step, insurance investigator David Brandstetter has questions--and they lead in some extremely unsavory directions in this classically styled California P.I. tale, directions that include the tawdry underbelly of prostitution, adult bookstores, and pornography.<br />This 1979 novel by Josephy Hansen is written in a style that calls to mind the best of such writers as James M. Cain: less of a detective story or murder mystery than a hard-as-nails action novel, Hansen's prose is clean, unsentimental, detailed, occasionally witty, and somewhat bitter.  The hero of the piece is a bit unusual, for Hansen's David Brandstetter is a gay man.  Some readers may be put off by this, but it will be their loss, for it gives the novel an edge of interest too often lacking in the genre, and even the most demanding reader will have no complaint with the fast-paced, action-laced, and very gritty story.  Recommended--if you can find it.	2002-01-12

There is actually a certain basis for this: both novels deal with youthful characters who are completely disenchanted by the world. But beyond this the comparison breaks down, for where CATCHER is essentially a character study, Plath's BELL JAR presents us with a tightly plotted story concerning a young woman's descent into insanity, and is in my opinion considerably more successful in an overall sense than virtually anything Salinger ever wrote.<br />The novel is largely autobiographical, recounting one of Plath's most notorious mental collapses that led to a very famous sucide attempt. In dealing with this personally volatile material, Plath shows remarkable control, and gracefully walks the fine line between carefully crafted fiction and self-indulgence, creating in the process a modern classic indicative of America at mid-century.<br />Plath herself considered the book simply a commercial &quot;pot boiler,&quot; a project undertaken in the hope of generating some cash. It is quite true that book is clearly written as a popular novel rather than serious fiction; it is also quite true that the book generates enough heat to boil water. But Plath was a uniquely gifted artist, and her talent simply bursts the seams of the genre: the book is possessed of a stunning passion and numerous powerful images delivered in a singularly uncompromising tone. Highly recommended.	2002-01-09

During the course of the novel he copes with the necessity of maturity much like waves on the beach, rushing forward toward it and then running away from it, repeating the cycle over and over again.  Portions of the novel strike me as a bit uneven, but not so much so that one would consider it uneven in a broad sense.  The characters are well drawn, and the episodic story reasonably entertaining.  It is most likely to appeal to teenagers, young adults, and mature adults capable of laughing at their own past teenage hysteria.  Well done for what it is, and you'll probably enjoy it, but hardly in the same class with the great novels of 20th century American literature.	2002-01-03

Still, Brown carries these books off with a light touch and considerable good humor, and WISH YOU WERE HERE, the first in the series, is actually among her better efforts in the series.<br />The novel introduces us to Mary &quot;Harry&quot; Haristeen, postmistress of a small Virgina town--and to her cat, Mrs. Murphy, and dog, Tee Tucker.  When their beloved &quot;mother&quot; decides to help local authorities in their effort to solve a string of grotesque murders, Mrs. Murphy and Tee Tucker decide to help out.  Brown's animal characters are able to talk to each other in this series, and their comments are often entertaining.  If you can accept the premise, and if you're not too picky about the details of the plot, you'll enjoy Brown's characters, tone of voice, and imagination.	2002-01-03

The accompanying text is a large and rather weighty book with a chapter for each of the poets. Each chapter includes a one-page biography, a two or three page essay on the works, and several representative poems including those read on the CD. Poetry fans of all stripe will be fascinated by the readings, which range from early (and difficult to understand) recordings by Lord Tennyson to fairly recent (and good quality) recordings by Sylvia Plath. Some of the recordings are quite rare and hard to find; others have been widely available for many years.<br />The great interest in this collection, of course, is the opportunity to actually hear a great poet--and possibly one of your own favorites--read their own work. And the result can be disconcerting, magical, and sometimes both. The earlier poets found in the collection do not read their poems so much for content as they do for rhyme, giving the rythms of their work emphasis above all else; later poets, however, are prone to read very dramatically, sometimes to the exclusion of all else. And there are a number of suprises. Carl Sandburg reads with a significant accent and such a lilt that he often sounds as if he is about to flow into song. Gertrude Stein and Dorothy Parker, two poets as different as night and day, have unexpectedly rich and warm voices. e.e. cummings reads very, very slowly--almost to a point at which you'd like to shake him by the shoulders and ask him to speed it up! Interestingly, it becomes increasingly obvious to the listener that a poet is not necessarily the best reader of his own work, for some are clearly more successful readers than others.<br />The recordings, be they good or bad, are always interesting. The same cannot be said for the text. The short biographies of each poet are reasonable, but the essays concerning their works are a very mixed lot. Some are quite interesting, addressing elements in both the poetry and the poet's reading of it; a few are so completely spurious that one wonders why the editors bother to include them at all. (I also find it a bit frustrating that two personal favorites--Marianne Moore and Stevie Smith--are not included in the collection, but this of course is a matter of personal taste.) In spite of the very occasional short-comings in the text, POETRY SPEAKS would be an ideal purchase for both budding and lifelong poetry lovers. It would also be ideal for the English teachers, literature professors, and librarians in your life.<br />Since none of the editorial reviews actually include the poets found in this collection, I note them here: Lord Tennyson; Robert Browning; Walt Whitman; William Butler Yeats; Gertrude Stein; Robert Frost; Carl Sandburg; Wallace Stevens; William Carlos Williams; Ezra Pound; H.D.; Robinson Jeffers; John Crowe Ransom; T.S.

Whatever their individual backgrounds, the characters tend to adopt reactionary postures toward and make assumptions about their fellow travelers based on both class and nationality; consequently, they tend to regard each other in a stereotypical light--but even as they fail to understand the truths behind the stereotypes, Porter highlights their lack of comprehension in a frequently comic but extremely disconcerting manner, thus demonstrating that her characters are at sea in more ways than one.<br /><br />There is obviously a certain symbolism to the novel, but Porter does not belabor it, and we are free to decide if we wish to read for pure pleasure or for deeper meanings.  Fortunately, there is an abundance of both.  Still, this not a novel to read quickly or casually. It requires time to develop clearly in the mind, so readers are advised to approach it with ample time in which to enjoy this superior work.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2001-12-25

And the involvement quickly spirals into a double murder that would haunt the city and the entire region for years to come.<br />The story is extremely convoluted, but Humes tells it with disturbing clarity and in the process captures the atmosphere of a city with a long history of political corruption and social hypocrisy, where strip joints and churches and slums and great mansions co-exist cheek-to-cheek.  In some respects the book does a disservice to the respectable citizens of the city, tarring them with the same brush as it does the criminal element, but there is no denying the power of this pitch-black story of life and death on the Biloxi strip, and Humes' book accurately follows the news updates on the case as they so slowly unfolded on the Mississippi gulf coast, as well as drawing material from those most intimately involved in the investigation.  In the same league as Capote's IN COLD BLOOD and Alexander's NUTCRACKER, those who read Hume's MISSISSIPPI MUD will find themselves in for a well-documented, increasingly disturbing, chilling, and fascinating time.	2001-12-16

And THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE is her masterpiece.<br />In an effect not unlike Henry James' famous &quot;The Turn of the Screw,&quot; Jackson presents us with Eleanor Vance, a woman who may or may not be already disturbed to the point of madness when the novel begins.  Invited to join a group of researchers investigating a reputedly haunted house, Eleanor--stifled by unhappy memories and an unsympathetic family--leaps at the chance for escape from her humdrum life.  She wants adventure, romance, a dash of excitement.  And at Hill House, a Victorian mansion of truly evil repute, she finds it in abundance.<br />Is there something--ghost, spirit, or simply mindless evil--at Hill House?  Or is it Eleanor herself, empty and hungry for a place where she belongs, who creates the nightmare that swirls about the place?  Jackson offers no easy answers in this, the finest American horror novel of the 20th century, a book often imitated but never equaled.  It is certainly not a novel for reading alone in the dead of night, but is one that you may wish to read again and again, repeatedly testing the boundaries of reality--and guessing at that which is always just beyond the limits of our vision.	2001-12-13

In the years to come, Christie will write a great many better novels than STYLES, but it is a solid start to a brilliant career. Christie fans will enjoy the book; others, however, may find it dated and wordy.	2001-12-11

But artists are not always the best judge of their own work, and while I wouldn't rank this Christie novel quite as highly as some others, I certainly don't consider it among her weaker efforts. A wealthy father's gift of a famous jewel to a headstrong daughter sets murder in motion, and Poriot must unravel a complex plot involving jewel thieves and con-artists to reach one of Christie's more satisfying solutions. Lightweight, perhaps, but no less charming for that.	2001-12-11

The story of an eccentric family smothered by a rich and wiley patriarch who meets with unexpected death, CROOKED HOUSE relies largely on character and atmosphere for effect.  These are not elements one normally expects from a Christie mystery--but not only does Christie deliver them here, she does so without allowing them to overshadow one of the craftiest puzzles in her career.  Prepare to read the novel in one sitting: you won't be able to put it down.	2001-12-06

The people on that list all have something very, very unpleasant in common: they are dead.<br />From this beginning, Agatha Christie weaves an unusual tale that mixes murder-for-hire and black magic in a most unexpected way.  The result is a novel with a good vs. evil edge so powerful that many readers will find it more than a little creepy.  THE PALE HORSE is also memorable for its unusual characterizations, most particularly in the opposing figures of Mrs. Dane-Calthrop, a vicar's wife who fights on the side of angels, and Thyzra Grey, a woman who claims to possess dangerous mystical powers.  As usual, Christie works her story toward a surprising conclusion--but on this occasion she offers a few shudders as well.  Unique in the Christie cannon and strongly recommended.	2001-12-06

There is more than a little truth to this criticism--but when dealing with a plotline that actually relies on these more literary effects Christie is more than able to meet the challenge.<br />Such is the case with THE HOLLOW, a strange and moody mystery in which both setting and the emotional complexity of the various characters are central to both story and solution.  When a woman is founding standing with gun in hand over the freshly-killed body of her husband, the solution would seem obvious--but there is a great deal more going on at the house known as &quot;The Hollow&quot; than meets the eye, and most of it is bound in the victim's questionable love life.  Although the solution to the mystery is not quite as disconcerting as one normally expects of Christie, the novel is a joy, and its characters will remain in mind long after the book is put aside.	2001-12-06

Coaxed into assisting &quot;La Sommita&quot; when his artist wife is asked to paint her, Inspector Allen begins the case in an effort to track down a photographer who has made a career of photographing the diva in the most unflattering ways possible--and then selling the photographs to newspapers in cities where she is appearing. Upsetting for the diva--and extremely amusing for the reader--but is there actual danger afoot? There most certainly is, and once more Allen is called upon to investigate a particularly nasty murder, this time with possible Mafia connections. Some readers may spot the killer long before the inspector himself, but even so Marsh's vivid way with words makes PHOTO FINISH a vastly entertaining read.	2001-12-06

The result is one of Marsh's more tightly plotted novels with enough twists to keep you guessing all the way to the end.  Unfortunately, it is also the Marsh novel most likely to offend modern readers.<br />Marsh is particularly noted for her ability to create well-rounded, convincing characters... but there is an exception: on the rare occasions when she deals with either implicitly or obviously gay characters, she inevitably characterizes them as slimy, dismissable, and unlikable--and even Inspector Allen, who is inevitably polite to one and all, feels free to behave toward them in the most obnoxious manner imaginable.<br />Marsh's tendency toward homosexual hysteria is noticeable in DEATH IN ECASTY and PHOTO FINISH, but it is particularly obvious here, and it is so powerful that it renders an otherwise wonderful bit of writing progressively distasteful.  Marsh is among my favorite mystery writers, and I did read the book to the end--but it was not a book that I kept on my shelf afterward.	2001-12-06

Finch not only writes about Garland's life in well researched, eloquent prose, his work also provides a broad overview of the world and times in which Garland both worked and lived, with considerable reference to those who shaped her personality and her art, and who contributed to both public and private successes and failings.  Truly a masterpiece of the biography genre, drenched with seldom-seen photographs as well.	2001-12-05

Considerably more than just a &quot;gay love story,&quot; Renault's novel examines what it means to be completely honest and completely fair in even the most difficult of relationships at even the most difficult moments of life.<br />Written with both on-the-surface (as in the myth of the Charioteer) and covert (it is no accident that many of the characters are in some way physically damaged, or that the story is set during England's darkest hours of the war) symbolism, Renault's novel encourages the reader to take time over it. Although sometimes demanding, the book casts a spell; I can honestly say that I did not want it to end, but I wanted to know more about what the future held for the characters. It is a book to which readers will return again and again.	2001-12-04

Determined to hold onto her own values, Gavin Lambert's Daisy Clover becomes one of the most memorable women in modern American fiction: witty, rebellious, and unwilling to give away an inch of personal integrity even while drowning in Hollywood's ocean of self-created myth.  Easily one of the finest books and most readable novels I've read in many years, you'll want to keep this one your shelf and return to it again and again.	2001-12-04

This criticism is unjust: Luft can scarcely be called a no-talent, and while it is true her family portrait is often harrowing, it is equally true that she writes from love.  While painfully honest about the more unsavory aspects of life with Judy Garland, she takes care to illustrate both the good times and the love that existed between Garland and her children, and she is certainly no more sparing of her own failings than she is of Garland or step-sister Liza Minnelli.<br />Much of the book focuses on Garland, but Me and My Shadows is less a book about Judy Garland than it is about Lorna Luft herself and how she coped with an increasingly dysfunctional family disintegrating under the weight of world-wide fame. Although not a writer per se, Luft writes openly and cleanly and from the heart, and the result is often very affecting. In one sense, the book adds nothing new to what the world already knows about Judy Garland: she was incredibly gifted, incredibly insecure, and as time passed increasingly addicted to and damaged by drugs. But it does offer a unique perspective, a view from the inside of an extraordinarily gifted (and extraordinarily tormented) family who loved each other in spite each others' failings--and ultimately and a vision of a daughter at last coming to terms with a painfully mixed legacy.  And that, perhaps, is the only success worth really having after all.	2001-11-29
US	51138056	R77WIOC54DKTK	0306808943	398320506	Judy	Books	4	14	17	N	N	Garland Under The Microscope	Gerold Frank's biography is probably the single most comprehensive book written concerning Judy Garland: meticulously researched, debunking many myths, and richly detailed, it is certainly a standard for any one seriously interested in Garland.  Even so, I have several issues with the book.<br />My single greatest complaint about the book is that Frank often seems to include detail for the sake of detail, and at times these details don't seem to make any cohesive statement.  That aside, while Frank places Garland under a microscope, he never really quite delivers any sense of the world in which she moved; consequently, we never really have any background against which we may judge her.  There is no context.<br />These are serious flaws, and while the book is certainly readable and enjoyable, I do not think it is one to which the average reader would return, nor would I particularly recommend it to any but the toughest of hard-core Garland fans.	2001-11-29

Written as it was on eve of World War II, these thoughts and ideas center upon developing a way of life that preserves, rather than destroys, that which is finest in both humanity and the world in general.<br />The novel is elegantly and simply written and possesses tremendous atmosphere.  Although enjoyable as a purely &quot;fun&quot; read, it is also thought provoking, and the thoughts it provokes linger long after the book is laid aside.  I can not imagine any one not being moved by the book, both emotionally and intellectually, regardless of their background or interests.  If such a person exists, I do not think I would care to meet them.<br />Although James Hilton wrote a number of worthy novels, Lost Horizon is the novel for which he is best remembered, a great popular success when first published and a genuine masterpiece of 20th Century literature.	2001-11-28

In earlier decades, this would have made the book as much fun for adults as for children, but the passage of time has not been entirely kind to the novel: adults with little background in earlier British culture may easily miss the sharp wit and children raised on the tooth-rotting Disney film will probably be disappointed by the book's depiction of Mary herself.  Parents who are willing to make the extra effort, however, will find it an extremely good opportunity for conversation with their children, for the various stories it contains (it is written in a very episodic way) will require plenty of commentary and explanation.<br />A surprising number of reviews accuse the novel of having paganistic, even satanic overtones.  I myself consider this a matter of people finding what they look for rather than actually arising from anything in the novel itself.	2001-11-28

Although leisurely written, the mystery itself is quite taunt and intriguing and the many complex characters that people the novel are exceptionally well-rounded and believable.  Sayers clearly enjoyed creating this particular work, and her pleasure in it illuminates the book to an exceptional degree.	2001-11-28

Frankly, I didn't find any reason for concern: the book is very much in the tradition of such children's classics as Baum's Oz novels, which have featured witches, sorcerers, goblins and the like without ever once being accused of satanic overtones.<br />The major difference between such as the Oz books and Harry Potter is that Oz--and others like it--are set in a completely imaginary world, while Harry Potter is not.  While this is probably the very thing that its detractors find most upsetting, it is actually the very thing that makes the book so much fun to read, for its fantasy elements take on a literal quality that allow for the willing suspension of disbelief in a way not previously seen in books written for children.  It is a very sophisticated bit of writing, and I look forward to reading the other books in the series myself.<br />These are not, by the way, books written for young children.  Most six and seven year olds will be completely out of their depth.  They are more appropriate to the ten-year-old and over crowd, who will have less difficulty reading them on their own.	2001-11-28

Several of Sayers murder mysteries--most notably Gaudy Night--achieve much of their effect via unusual settings and atmosphere, and Murder Must Advertise presents us with a mystery set in a 1930s advertising agency, a circumstance that not only gives the reader insight into a world that the author knew first-hand, but allows Sayers to satirize the business of advertising itself.  Charming, witty, peopled with interesting characters doing interesting things, and thoroughly fun to read.	2001-11-28

Like several other novels that involve both Sayers' sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey and mystery novelist Harriet Vane, the novel is as much a portrait of their relationship as it is a murder mystery, and while these two elements occasionally seem at odds in other works (most notably the unworthy Have His Carcass), Busman's Holiday strikes a perfect balance between the two as we follow the couple through the first few days of their honeymoon as they deal with the shock of marriage, domestic disasters, and an unexpected body in their honeymoon home's basement.  As in other novels, Sayers draws a great deal from her setting--in this case rural England on the eve of World War II--and presents us with a memorable cast of supporting characters, and the result is as fine a novel as she ever produced, particularly notable for its wittiness and sly humor.  A greatly satisfying finish to a highly enjoyable series.<br /><br />There is, incidently, an extremely well-made 1930s film version of this particular work starring Robert Montgomery and Constance Cummings.  Although Montgomery is not quite the image of Lord Peter Wimsey, he plays quite well, and Cummings is Harriet Vane brought to life on the screen.  Sayers fans should enjoy the film almost as much as they enjoy the book!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer	2001-11-28

The photographs range from  great art to the trivial effort and from haunting beauty to the occasional  effort to shock-- the latter of which focuses, ironically, less on nudity  than on activity.  While I recommend the book, I must note that the  accompanying text is fairly insignificant and the images selected from  1950-1990 are considerably less interesting than those of 1900-1950.  I  must also note that this is NOT an &quot;outsize&quot; or &quot;coffee  table size&quot; book; rather, it is a very thick but otherwise  standard-size book; this, however, does not really detract from the  content.	1999-12-06
