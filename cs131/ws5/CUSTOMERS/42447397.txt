She tells her story from her first memory all the way up to as recent as December 04 allowing the reader becomes captivated by her struggles.<br /><br />Cofessions of a Video Vixen will pull you in and make you want to read more and more. You will find that this young woman was truly addicted to the lifestyle of sex, drugs, and music. Leaving her child behind to be cared for by virtual strangers, Ms. Steffans jumped from man to man, bed to bed, from alcohol to pills all for the roller coaster ride of becoming the whore to the celebrities. In the midst of all her partying she lucked up on becoming a video dancer and landing a part in the movie A Man Apart, as Larenz Tates wife. When she thought that she was at the top of her game and everyone was in love with her she found herself to be an addict of love as well as with the drugs and alcohol. She was broke and homeless but somehow someone kept reaching down and lifting her back up.<br /><br />Ms. Steffans is on her way to stardom if only she can humble herself and appreciate the gifts within a gift that God has given her. The average girl making it to Hollywood would be envious to know how easy she made it and would probably marvel at the idea of the men she has slept with. However, there is a lesson to be learned that lies within the text of writing and I think it is a great read and something that should be shared with young girls alike. Ms Steffans struggles merely ended eight months ago and if this is her true story I pray that she stays strong and keep catching the beat to move on.	2005-08-04

Linsey shows the reader of the ups and downs of being interested in sex with other males as he struggles with the church and his family. <br />Brought up in the City of Brotherly Love and attending church his entire life Linsey had to find a spiritual belief on his own. The church that he attended in Philadelphia was more of cult than a church and as many folks church gossip was ever so present. He was taught that he had to confess to the pastor in order to get into the pearly gates at the end of the road. He did as the pastor instructed, he told her all his feelings towards other men and how he wish he didn't feel the things that he was feeling and how he prayed feverishly for God to relieve him of these feeling. Instead of holding this information in silence the pastor being a woman decided it was best that the congregation knew of this information and it spread like wild flower. Ultimately he was not only embarrassed but also fed up with the cult like activities and not only left the church but left the city headed for the mid west. <br />The west brought about a different set of wins and loses. He found a platonic friendship in another male who also was engaging in same sex activities for him to only leave him. His dear friend suffered from AIDS and sent Linsey into a slight depression. He found solace in his spiritual being and a female friend from church. When she fell in love with him and he explained his same sex issues with her she took a breathing period but yet remained his closet confidant<br />I must say that I enjoyed this book, it is more a book about spirituality than it is about same sex relationships. I enjoyed reading the different ways different churches practices Christianity. I gave this book a four because It was not only educational for me but I also enjoyed watching him grow from a boy to a man. It was real; by the time the book ended I felt that I knewthis gentleman personally. I would recommend Unconventional View to anyone who is dealing with sexual frustration and spirituality. <BR>.	2004-05-25

The storyline and characters were simply magnificent. The story holds you captive as you are so into the next event that you are paralyzed to the end. <br />Walter Armstrong was abandon by his father after his mother died and left to be raised by his barely eighteen year old sister. Going through life and handling the responsibility of fatherhood was like second nature for him. He totally refuses to abandon his child like his father had done him. It was good watching him remain the good guy throughout.<br />Journey a female character brought up being abused and dealing with a drug addict mother and a father who felt it was his duty to have sex with her ran away after being confronted with the reality that her father may be her child's father. Journey a name given to her by a john that she picked up as his quest is to pull her off the mean city streets of Detroit and give her a life that is much more pleasant. I don't want to tell you too much of this womens story I think it would be putting too much out there. I will say I enjoyed this book immensely.<br />I most likely would have given this book a five star rating however, her character Rachel's story could have been a whole other book in its entirety. It had no relevance to the Journey and her story. But all in all this was a great read. I started this book and finished it all within a five hour span, again I would recommend anyone to read this book who is dealing with lost love ones and homosexuality. <br />Stacy D Campbell	2004-05-15

Once you get passed the dialect that the characters use you have the real deal of highs and lows of the day and a life of a whore. For all the young girls of the ghetto I would say this is a must read, to keep you focus of what a rough life the streets have to offer.<br />Reviewed by <br />Stacy D Campbell	2004-01-13

From Gussie Mae to Pee Wee they all bring out a laughter, a tear and a smile. <br />God Still Don't Like Ugly is a part two of God Don't Like Ugly so please please read that first. If by chance you don't, read God Don't Like Ugly first don't worry Ms. Monroe does a wonderful job of catching you up on previous events. <br />We all that Annette Goode, had finally gotten on the good foot after her life of misfortunes.

When she confessed to Annette of her murderous events Annette was scared beyond belief. Yet she knew her friendship with Rhoda would have to end. Never did she think in her wildest dreams that the death of a 6-year-old Italian girl would bring back the friendship she had with Annette. Never did she think that she would pay for the crimes she committed, but Ms. Monroe did a fine job of showing us that God Don't Like Ugly and you reap what you sow. <br />Pee Wee was another childhood friend of Annette's she shared just about everything with ole Pee Wee.

These incidents take place during a four-month period. Some of the events are everyday young urban events, while others are wild and crazy. Yet most females that will read this book will be able to relate. <br />Na'Imah pronounced Ni-eemah was raised with different religious <BR>backgrounds which could have been partly responsible for the <BR>irresponsible behavior this female portrayed. She was raised as <BR>Muslim however she has never attended Mosque, her grandmother always took her to the Kingdom Hall and she attended church with her friends. Na'Iamh travels through life believing her inner <BR>voice, her consciences is actually God speaking to her. This made a lot of sense to me since that inner voice is the voice we hear most often when we are on the road of destruction.<br />I thought this book was pretty good. It gives you something to <BR>think about, such as that inner voice. Or why are we as humans so quick to ignore the voice that we all know is right. I think the book ended too soon and would have loved to read about Na'Imah in a longer novel form.

Once you <BR>read the first page, the characters come alive and keep you wanting <BR>more.<br />The main character, Carmen, learns life lessons through carrying <BR>emotional draining secrets which become burdens that are just too <BR>heavy to carry.

Her characters are addicting to the reader, one line and you will want to read more. <br />Lyric Devaney is a top notch diva, doing whatever is necessary to make it to the top of her game in the entertainment industry. Realizing, once she made it there that she stepped on the toes of those who really loved, care for and knew her best. <br />Joshua Tune, attorney at law, was very focused in his business life yet, very careless in his personal one until he lost the one person who loved him unconditionally. However, he would never be able to retrace his faults and move on. He finds himself so engrossed in capturing a murderer until he has lost all self respect and drugs took over. <br />Richard Cardenale, mayor of the City of New York plays his cards tight. In one sense, he is racist and very contradicting in the other. His appetite for black woman was so overwhelming until he jeopardized his career. Fortunately, for his wife and his connections he would maintain his status and go on to being Senator. With nothing standing in his way, he cannot wait to run for presidency. <br />Madison Michaels is a well-educated sistah that is on her way to becoming an attorney but gets side tracked by what she perceived as love. Love; a powerful emotion that would make this girl lose all sense of reality and life. She placed her friends, credit, and job on the line for a con artist that sensed her vulnerability and set out to use and kill her when there was no more using left. Fortunately, for her sake, she was just a victim of ignorance and he would lose his life before she could lose hers. <br />I have read many books and there are many more I will read. This one has just been placed at the top of my favorites list. The plot was so well thought out that I would just love to see it on the big screen. In my opinion this is a book for every one of all races and sex, it is an educational lesson for woman and men alike. Ms. Winslow did a wonderful job portraying the characters and setting the stage.

Her book is considered to be her autobiography, thus would lead someone to the assumption that this is a book about her life.  In reading the book I would not say it was about her life, I would say that it is about relationship issues. I was displeased with this book because its contents only discussed the pain that the relationship had on her. In my opinion this book was most likely written because she felt the need to tell someone, possibly to help another. However, the message was not clear and will not penetrate the minds of women with similar issues.  There is not enough detail given, and too often I was unable to tell if she was talking about her husband or one of the many men that she used to validate her existence.  I think Ms. Gilbert could have elaborated more on the relationship itself so the reader could get a feel for the characters, the situations, and the pain that she endured.  <br />All women at one time or another have had similar experiences with men; I read nothing in the book that was significant enough to write about other than she learned to get over and move on. Ms. Gilbert's family members were key factors in her aid to move forward.  Her father was a strong force in her life, which enabled her to learn self-love, which was required for her to get out of the repetitive routine of bad choices in men.  I would not recommend this book because there really was not much to read and I was disappointed that a woman could write a book and call it her autobiography when it talks about nothing but disappointment from men as if her life didn't consist of much more.  <br />Stacy D Campbell<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-02-20

Ms Angelou's A Song Flung Up To Heaven is a collection of her memoirs collaborated together to form this book of great historical events and how they effected her life. <br />I was surprised at some of the events that have taken place in her life and how she chose to handle them. I was also baffled at the lifestyle she was living while networking with some of the black elite entertainers and leaders, which demonstrates it is not what you know but who you know.<br />Ms Angelou hits hardest on her relationships with James Baldwin and the African, whom she never names. Although I thought she should have gone into more detail about her son Guy, she did express her love for him as well as her brother who had a profound affect on her stability as a woman.  Ms. Angelou highlighted the Watts riots that took place in the 60's and all though she went into great detail about the riots, I think I may have missed the effects it had on her, nonetheless the actual events were well written and educational. I would definitely recommend this book. <br />Stacy Campbell<BR>Apooo Bookclub	2002-12-22

It was beautifully written and was easily captivated by the characters.  Right from the beginning I felt bad for Lisa, her life was too perfect and my experience is those who have perfect lives are usually very boring people. I thought Lisa was too persistent for any man let alone Ross, someone that was constantly living up to the perception of others wishes. And Asha, poor Asha. I loved her and felt sorry for her. I know someone just like her. I wanted to just give her a hug and tell it would be all right...guess you just can't do that to fiction characters. However, it was a great book that made me want to call my sister in Killeen TX and simply say I love you.<BR>Even though this book didn't end anything like I thought it would have, I must say it was good, and well written.	2002-11-13

Reaching Back <BR>By <BR>Nea Anna Simone<br />5 Pens<br />Reaching Back is a ride through a journey of lives of her ancestors and their color complex issues. The author does a wonderful job of going back through four generations to show the ups and downs of women and their struggles with love, life and race. Reaching Back forces you to take a look inside your soul and make decisions that you thought you would never have to face. Wondering in that time and that place what would you do? <br />As I read each of the women stories I felt as I was living each of them in their time. This book brought tears to my eyes and made me realize just how serious this issues that this still is today here in the 21st century where I know people are still struggling with life trying to pass for something that they aren?t. <br />This book is not only very interesting but it captivates you to the very end. Ms Simone does a wonderful job creating not only the characters but the times as well. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good book. <br />Stacy	2002-10-12

My sister bought this book for me for Christmas, well it took me over 4 months before I decided that I would read it.

John had me with his lack of confidence and his need to feel loved. and Darin I loved the fact that he was confident and he was secure in being a man and being a friend.
