It will help to read Good to Great, before, after, or along with this book, because Rainer outline and insights are developed from Good to Great.  The book has several good points about turn around or break out churches.  The good thing is he has comparison churches to illustrate his points.  The caution is that research can tell us what is but does not mean predictability (that whole correlation does not mean or imply causation).  I would like Rainer to continue his research, to see if his conclusions are applicable to other churches.  I always wonder about leadership issues, and would have liked a better idea of what stage the leaders were in at the break out stage.  The book is well written, and should be read any interested in church growth, or turning around a church.	2005-05-06

Manning writes in a style that is very readable and even tender.  He clearly accounts for grace in his life.  Even if you disagree with his theology, The Ragamuffin Gospel is well worth reading.

Barna presents some good ideas about leadership, based on his experience.  He presents his own theories about what makes a leader and the issues facing a leader.  <br />His book is well worth studying.  The book should be included in any course on leadership, secular or not.  He make a good argument that leader are called to the task.

He has a valid concern, but he offers no real alternatives. He quotes and takes so much material from O S Guinness, John Macarthur, David Wells, and G A Pritchard that you might as well read those sources as opposed to his. His main focus is on the entertainment aspects of some churches. He uses Willow Creek and Saddleback as the objects of his arguments. He fails to mention many other mega churches that have used marketing for years. Liberty Baptist and Jerry Falwell is an example of a church and minister using marketing to gain attendance. He seems to believe that preaching and ministering to peoples needs is wrong. In their day D L Moody and Charles Spurgeon were known for looking to people's needs, \\"marketing\\" themselves, and considered entertainment.<br /><br />Reading the book, I got the distinct impression that Gilley believes that having fun or being entertained while at church is unscriptural and bad. If you are entertaining people at church then you are doing a disservice to those in attendance. He makes valid arguments that churches that follow a marketing/entertainment model are not making disciples or teaching the scriptures. There does appear to be a serious problem in some mega and non-mega churches not teaching the word and producing mature Christian.<br />He is against psychology as well. As someone trained as a psychologist and a licensed counselor, I find his arguments poor. It appears he has never studied those who have noetic theories, that is, those who include the spiritual realm. Jay Adams comes to mind as a counselor who believes many problems have as their root cause sin.<br />He spends time decrying the evils of preaching that fulfils peoples needs or results in the fulfillment any ones emotional or psychological needs. According to Gilley, fufillment and being entertained at a worship service is wrong, that is, not worshiping in spirit and truth.<br />The book does sound a caution note about the lack of strong biblical teachings. I have the same concerns that strong, biblically based preaching and teaching is greatly needed. I would urge all to people to return to exegesis of the bible, and not to the Fundamentals of Truth.h.<br />The book does sound a caution note about the lack of strong biblical teachings.

The Mantra of Jabez was just as good in it's parody.  <BR>Gilley has his own subtle hemeneutic errors.  If you are really interested in hermenuetics, buy some books on it, or on how to study the bible.  Make sure you read more than one book on the subject matter, because you will learn more by using more than one source.  There are a number of Bible Colleges that offer courses on hermeneutics or how to study the bible on the internet or via distance learning courses.<br />Gilley's tone is somewhat acerbic, if not caustic (even though he denies this).  Overall, it's worth the read, but don't take offence.	2003-03-26

Unfortunately many believe that this statement is not true.  After working with prison inmates and kids in community MHMR settings, I see the roots of criminal thinking in many so-called \\"disturbed\\" kids.  Any one who works with kids needs to read this book.  I would recommend reading The Criminal Mind as well.  Do not dismiss this book with out carefully considering it carefully. <br />Dr. Samenow applies his years of research and experience with the criminal and applies it to childern.  Some may argue that kids are different from adult criminals, but in many ways they are not.  There are obivious differences, but there is a suprising similarity in their thought process.  I have extensive experience with criminals, inmates, and \\"disturbed\\" kids.  Intervention as early as possible is required.	2003-03-03

She does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people's work she denigrates.  Maslow's hierarchy of needs is one example. I have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings.  I have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with Carl Rogers, and William Coulson as instructors. Any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job Ms Milton did presenting them.  She should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book.  Her bias is extreme and obvious. So consider this when reading the book.  No doubt Ms Milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs.  I am sure Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology.	2003-01-28

What I got was a book that made me think and challenged some of my &quot;sacred cows&quot;.  Rainer uses scientific survey methods as the foundation of this book.  He presents facts about those who came to church for the 1st time or returned after extended absence from the church (the formally un-churched).  He asked, \\"What caused you join the church?\\" (the churched).  He goes further than asking what would make one want to come to church by asking the new converts what brought them to the church.  Well worth the read.  At this time, I would consider it one of the top ten books to read on church growth and evangelism.<br />I like the fact it is based on actual research.

Here was some one saying coherently what I have always believed.  The book has more of a management slant, but it is a focus long ignored by churches.  Every Christian and church needs to read this book and work to apply the principles.  No one should use this book as a cookie cutter or master plan for his or her church.

Most people do not realize that the prisons are rapidly becomming the largest  providers of mental health services, as is the case in TX.  Kupers goes off  track and has his own agenda.  This book becomes a polemic for diagnosing all  inmates as PTSD, just because they are in prison.  His claim that as an outsider  he is more than objective.  I believe the book reports on many problems in a lot  of prisons.  I kept waiting for him to address, in a meaningful way, managed care  and privatization of services.  The issue of the mentally ill in prison is a  growing problem.  I would hope that those who read the book, will try to open  dialog about the problems and possible solutions.  I work for the managed care  organization that provides mental heath services to TX prisons, and many of Kuper's  points hit home.  I have already recommended the book to my colleges.	1999-10-07

This is a book that you will need to read several times to  apperciate it's depth, but it is well worth it.  I often feel I obtain a  higher leval of consciousness and often I feel in an altered state after  reading and pondering Tillich's writting.  Tillich outlines fundemental  concepts for existentialist and modern theology.  Starting with Tillich's  books of sermon is a good work up to this book.	1998-11-25
