Understanding your pet is so important, and the more we can learn about and develop positive interactive communication signals the stronger will be the bond we share with our furry family members. Being \\"in-touch\\" with<br /><br />your pet is an important part of enhancing the human-animal bond, and a critical part of a successful holistic health care program. Those clients whose patients I am proud to treat who are most in-tune with their pets have the greatest successes with both preventing and treating diseases.<br /><br />Shawn Messonnier DVM<br /><br />author, the award-winning The Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats, The Allergy Solution for Dogs, and 8 Weeks to a Healthy Dog	2005-09-18

While James Herriott is best known for this genre, it's nice to see other doctors with a flair for writing also sharing their many interesting experiences. Dr. Sharp has written a neat book that pet owners and veterinarians are sure to enjoy. The stories are light-hearted and ones veterinarians everywhere can certainly relate to as they read.

It explores all of the facets of well-being in pets, and as far as I know is the first to acknowledge and discuss mental health in animals. Many years ago when I first learned animal behavior, we were told not to be anthropomorphic. Simply put, animals did not have the same \\"feelings\\" attributed to humans. Since that time, new research has shown us that animals do in fact experience in their own ways many of the emotions experience by people. The book is divided into 21 chapters covering a wide array of topics. These include stress, boredom, pleasure, mental illness in animals and its treatment, and the mental well-being of farm animals, laboratory animals, and birds. It's quite an interesting topic and a book that I would highly recommend!<br /><br />Shawn Messonnier DVM<br /><br />The Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats, 8 Weeks to a Healthy Dog, The Allergy Solution for Dogs	2005-09-11
