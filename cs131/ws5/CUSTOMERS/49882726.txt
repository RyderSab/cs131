Nor would I call it &quot;Chick Lit&quot;. This is a completely original story that is both charming, amusing, probing and romantic about a woman who suddenly finds herself to be someone other than herself.  &quot;Inhabited&quot; by Franz Schubert, she struggles with the awkward and often comic intrusion of his brilliant talent, but also the realization that her own uniqueness may be getting short shrift in the equation.   The scenes are powerful and often funny.  The balancing between personas is cleverly managed.  <br />Through this bizarre relationship with Schubert, our heroine, reevaluates relationships with her boyfriend, parents, sister, old friends, at the same time she and Franz are coping with some of his unfulfilled passions and needs. There are some great surprises, and some very emotional moments.<br />There's much to be learned about music and those who live in that rarified world.  <br />There are some awesome scenes towards the end that will translate into a very powerful movie.   This book was pure joy.	2004-06-18

I'm a book-a-week thriller reader and, as far as I'm concerned, THE DEVIL'S BANKER deserves the &quot;thriller of the year&quot; award.<br />It's smart, exciting and as fresh as tomorrow's headlines.<br />Don't miss this one!!	2003-10-11

Excuse the pun, but this book is so on target. As soon as I saw the title, I thought I heard my conscience speaking. Like many of my friends, colleagues and neighbors, I recently found myself chasing the buck and losing sight of the more important priorities.  Ms. Chatzkey's book helps to re-focus the reader on what's really matters and most importantly, how to achieve it.  The book is an interesting combination of good practical advice that we'd expect from a therapist coupled with good practical advice we'd want from a financial advisor. It's going to be my &quot;bible&quot; in terms of getting back on the track of living an enriched life and not just a rich life.	2003-09-30

Dr. Phil is out of his element spewing homilies about dieting and fitness. This is an area better left to those who have the credentials to propose healthy diet and nutrician plans. Even his &quot;physchology&quot; regarding weight loss lacks any real substance. Very disappointing.	2003-09-15

Whether you read THE LAST GOOD DAY because you're a fan of suspense fiction or you're just looking looking for a great dramatic tale, you'll find this novel to be a fulfilling experience.  It's a first-rate story that's populated by original characters and propelled by a plot that won't let you put it down until you've read the last page.

I was extremely fortunate to get my hands on an advance copy of DERAILED from a friend who runs a bookstore.  She gave it to me saying, \\"this is the best thriller I've read in years,\\" which is high praise indeed, as she is acknowledged as our city's most discriminating and knowledgeable reader of suspense fiction.  Her recommendations are gospel around here.  Fortunately, DERAILED is as good as her word.  From the first chapter, when we are hurled into the main character's dilemma, the book produces a powerful magnetic force that kept me riveted to its pages for the day that it took me to read it.  Siegel's storytelling is masterful and his writing style is mesmerizing.  This is the thriller that I will be recommending to *everyone* for months to come.	2003-02-09

WHAT HAPPY PEOPLE KNOW is a real wake-up call -- an invaluable treatise on graciously accepting the best parts of who we are and building on them in order to gain a true appreciation of how wonderful life can -- and should -- be.

From the introduction of the real George Plimpton on the first page to its stunning conclusion, THE DRIFT is unlike anything Ridley or, for that matter, any other crime writer I've ever read, has produced.  The book is suspenseful, touching, bizarre and, at times, quite funny.  If there were a sixth star in this rating system, that's what I'd give THE DRIFT.	2002-09-27

This is the first time in about a year that I stayed up all night reading a book that I quite literally couldn't put down.

Beginning with &quot;Under Cover of Daylight&quot;, I've read all the books and &quot;Blackwater Sound&quot; is one of the best.  It's got everything you'd expect from this author: moments that thrill you, others that touch you and some that make you laugh.  And, the characters are memorable -- especially the still-in-love-with-her-dead-brother main villian. <br />Definitely a five-star thriller.	2002-01-05

As much as I loved Hall's previous two books -- &quot;Body Language&quot; and &quot;Rough Draft&quot; -- I was ready to hang with my old buddy Thorne again.<br />Hall is the best of the Florida writers -- in fact, he may just be the best living suspense novelist.  And, the great news is that &quot;Blackwater Sound&quot; as as good as anything he's ever written.  There plot is both elegant and subtle -- no super-villians or schtick.  It's smart stuff all the way through.  Enormously entertaining crime fiction that's also fine literature.    <br />I'm ready for his next one.	2001-12-18

His first novel displays great writing and plotting along with a contant sense of threat to William, its septagenarian protagonist, that is at first low-key, but builds to terrifying levels as the story develops.  This novel is much, much more than a detective story. It's stunningly compelling first-rate fiction.	2001-05-29
