Fortunately, he found a sport that helped him to clear his mind.  This sport turned out to be the best thing for him.<BR>      Overall, I thought this book was pretty good.  The only thing that concerned me was that the author, Chris Crutcher, didn't quite make it clear who all of the characters were.  This book might be just a little mature for sixth and seventh graders.  This isn't such a great book for elementary students.  I also thought this book had some really funny parts in it.  Out of five stars, I would rate this book a 4.	2003-03-14

It becomes exciting when the actual plot begins after a few chapters. The back of the book was what caught my intrest in it. I would recommend you read the back of the book for a short summary of it. If you don't have a wild imagination, I recommend  you don't read this book. If you are a person with a wild imagination, hold on tight and get ready for the craziest laws you can imagine. One of which is you are not aloud to have more than two children and if you, you must keep them well \\"Hidden\\" because if you don't, you will suffer horrible consequences from the government!

Even though I can't really relate to this story myself, I know that a lot of children are going through a similar situation. That is why we should always make sure everything is o.k. with where they are living, instead of just leaving them there and never check on them like Mr. Poe did to the Buadelaire children.	2003-03-14

This book isn't a horrible book, but not what people have come to expect from Clancy. First, the complaints. This book's biggest weakness is it's bad habit of jumping around, and jamming characters in for the entirity of  three pages. Obviously, those characters aren't given much opportunity for  development, and even some of the major characters seem to be either flat  or generic. Also, the plotline,while serviceable, has been done before, and  better, and there are many mediocre subplots. On to the good point. This  book has some very exciting moments, especially during the (Potential  spoiler)terrorist attack on New York. The rest of the book, however, tends  to be dog slow. All in all, it's an OK book, but not on par with previous  Clancy efforts.	2000-01-07

The book &quot;Making Up Magaboy&quot; is about a 13 year old boy who takes his  fathers gun and goes to the local liquor store. He opens fire on a Korean  man and kills him. He was a very good student and he is also a good kid. He  doesn't have many friends, though. Since events like Columbine, books like  this are much more realistic and believable. I would recommend this book to  people who like books that are for the mind not the heart.	2000-01-07

It had the two main fantasy things: magic and dragons.  Magic was used throughout the book.  But the dragons came towards the end.  the book is about a band of draconians who escaped their masters and built  a small village.  They where poor farmers so the stole from their  neighbors, the dwarves. The dwarves stole from the draconians. So each side  used clubs and other weapons instead of swords.  Though the draconians  always carried a sword with them just in case they got into real trouble.  The draconians stole food and other things.  Though they tried to get alot  of dwarven spirits.  Which is like beer and liqour I think. The dwarves  steel gold, sheep, and other things. The draconians that know spells dont  use them to kill any dwarves so don't think that. The dragons come towards  the end but that part will ruin the story if i told you. This book is  really good and I the people who like Dragonlance books should read this  one.	2000-01-07
