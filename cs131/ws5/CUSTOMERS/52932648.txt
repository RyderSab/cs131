In some cases, the information is provided in almost elementary style, which is not bad, but most of the writings are very hard to digest.  I did learn a great deal from this book, but I admit, I will have to reengage it again to get the full benefit.	2001-06-24

As they point out, the leader of the future must be serious about communication and not just pay it lip-service, they must share as much of their power, as possible, with members in the organization to make it a more powerful organization.  This open communications and power sharing leads to a learning organization, that is inculturated to adapt to the changing enviornment and more importantly help &quot;lead-turn&quot; the organization to ensure a sustained competitive advantage.	2001-06-24

A great read to help you understand what Socrates did on a continuous basis-true communication leading to indepth understanding.  I got many Aha's from the book, but two major points that stand out are (1) democracy ended with the vote, and (2) in a discussion, if your not talking you are &quot;reloading&quot;.  The take-aways are that we in most cases are not focused on coming to closure and fully understanding an issue or problem.  We hold our own views without listening to the facts or assumptions surrounding another individuals view.  We don't go to the deeper levels of understanding.  This leads to false assumptions being made-which in most cases leads to some type of conflict.  Should be mandatory reading for anyone desiring to be a true leader!	2001-02-03

This is a book on how information technology can and has, torn down the walls of organizations.  The first example is Britannica with many others to follow.  A major point made by the author is that to be successful, separating your product from the information is the best solution.  For example,  books in warehouses-but you go on-line for the information, which drives your decision to want to read a specific book and also your purchase point.  Some of the future points made, include on-line or in a dealer's office (with no cars on the lot) shopping for a new car.  So where do you get the feel of the drive?  How about Hertz or Budget?  These are just snippets, of what's to come.  A good read to make you think of possible future alternatives.	2001-02-03

It is an &quot;easy to complex&quot; book which is perfect for the classroom or for the manager who wants to improve his or her strategic management skills in the comfort of their reading room.  The strategic management model developed by the authors is easy to follow--and remember--to include the many connections it makes with external and internal analysis.  I am most impressed with the authors' coverage of leadership, organizational structure, and culture.  Not only will you learn the basics of strategic management--but it is a quick read and includes some outstanding case study's to reenforce the learning.  A great read.	2000-12-03

The beauty is that you can see yourself in a less threatening way--and realizing what you need to do to change yourself--to make you more change ready.  I've read many books on change--and I still really liked this one--because it is a story I can tell my coworkers--where they can in a humorous way see where they fit in--without it being a negative lesson.

This is one of those books, you can read and get &quot;aha's&quot; from  start to finish.  It's not the touchy-feely stuff non-quality believers  think when they hear quality and measurements.  The authors provide a step  by step roadmap that is very well described and visually enhanced with some  of the most outstanding charts I've seen.  Between the well organized  thought and flow of the book--the connections between strategy, tactics,  CEO level, worker level, financial, customer, internal business processes,  and organizational learning aspects are crystal clear.  If you want to  change your organization--or just improve what's important in your  organization--this one is a must.  And, it is not just a balanced  measurement program--it leads to a balance management program--with  everyone connected.	2000-09-18

The 80/20 Principle really helps you to reframe your  thinking as you start into the problem analysis mode.  As the title  suggest--it's the little things that can lead you to the big fix or  solution.  The author provides many examples of the phenomenon--The Pareto  Principle.  One of my favorites that I use on many occasions--is that last  20% of time left in a meeting is where you will make 80% of the decisions.	2000-09-18

It is  user-friendly for all audiences, instructors, students, CEOs, Operations  Managers, and the 65% of the organization that must work with Operations  Managers.  It is filled with in-depth, but easy to understand examples for  those who are not experts or currently working in the Operations Management  function.  However, it is a must read for the experts as it provides many  insights on how your system should connect with other organizational  functions, and recommendations as to how you can optimize your system.

Nadler and Shaw point out that only those companies able to respond quickly and effectively to changing environmental conditions will survive in the coming decades.   Successful firms must learn and act at a faster rate than their  competition.  Many leaders can affect some change in an organization-but it  is normally short lived.  But, to make change more long term and make that  change take place at a faster rate-you must create destabilizing events in  significant scope to get attention-and keep it!  There are many take-aways  in this book.  If you want an outstanding \\"Leadership 101\\" book in 276  short pages-this is the one you want.	2000-07-03

This book is based on the assumption that the thinking and communication skills of leadership, can, and must, be learned.  And that leadership begins with personal growth.  Just as Covey and Edgar Schein point out-we  must understand and change ourselves, then truly know the culture of our  people to accomplish change-because it is not the organization that gets  changed-it's the people.  In order for a leader to lead change, the author  suggest a new way of thinking--more open to all possibilities-called  Synvergent thinking-the synergetic integration of convergent and divergent  thinking.  Gelb in a very simplistic manner walks you through mind-mapping  techniques, which integrates convergent and divergent thinking.  I am sold  on his technique-it brings out the positives of brainstorming, even if only  brainstorming with yourself-but the end result is a visual product-that  clearly identifies what you the leader want your people to  understand-decrease the fog quickly-opening up opportunity for dialogue.  A  must buy for leaders, followers, parents, teachers, etc.	2000-07-03

As Peter Drucker put it \\"The best way to predict  the future is to create it.\\"  This book Marshall is an outstanding read.   As identified in this book-70% of all our problems in business are  people-related or culturally based-in my opinion-I don't believe you can  separate the two.  However, Marshall tells us our job is to engage that  culture (people) so that its best values emerge and flourish.  In order to  accomplish these tasks \\"the collaborative environment must be established\\".   Two of my favorite business leaders are Jack Welch and Sam Walton.  They  predicted their future by creating it-the company culture-feedback-focus on  the vision-and betting their organizations future and success on allowing  their employees to participate and take ownership of their key processes.

This is my very first Higgins read  and I will seek other Higgins books.  The author kept me fully engaged on  two business flights--I don't even remember the snack on the flight.  This  book will take you from the White House--to the United Kingdom and back on  the Concord or US Government Aircraft, with many plots taking place, key  people involved, and many connections on both continents taking place at  the same time--you will be itching for the flight to be over--to get the  key players where they need to be.

It is said that knowledge capital decreases quickly in our  information-based society, so not only must we keep ourselves up to date on  current changes--we must also re-evaluate the old facts we've learned.   Langer points out six myths and explains them away with research to support  it.  One of those myths and our perception have made us medicalize an  academic deficiency.  We have medically treated many children, diagnosed  with Attention Deficit Disorder, when the educational system including  parents do not understand that the student is being distracted by something  else more attractive.  The idea here is to make our learning more  attractive than it currently is by allowing a more creative and questioning  environment.  I watched a 30-minute PBS special with Ellen Langer  discussing her book and have read the book--her interview was much better  and to the point.  However, her book questions five other myths all related  to the fact that the environment changes.  To leave you with my favorite  sentence in the book--it will give you a taste of what the book is  about--&quot;Not only do we as individuals get locked into single-minded  views, but we also reinforce these views for each other until the culture  itself suffers the same mindlessness.&quot;	2000-04-04

His research was in-depth  and made you never question its validity.

I don't  believe you can arm-chair quarterback a war or battle--and this book points  out that most participants of the Civil War were putting their lives on the  line--to protect their states or the Federal Government.  This book takes  the politics and social issues out of the central focus.  It explains why,  and how, a young man in Virginia or Maine gives the ultimate gift.  Next,  the book will align you with your own heros of the Civil War, especially  Gettsyburg--Lee, Longstreet, Hancock, Chamberlin, Pickett.

The book even drove me to discuss the virus with a  Disease Prevention professional who studied the disease in Zaire (not to be  named).  With a global economy--many modes of travel--quick travel--ebola  having a 14-day incubation period--one drop of Ebola Zaire could wipe out  &quot;many&quot; major cities in just days.

With &quot;change&quot; the norm, you must know how to lead the change and we don't lead dollars or materials--it is people--as Tom Peters puts it--&quot;people are our only  asset&quot;.  The author does an outstanding job of walking you through how  to make change a reality--dealing head on--with people.  I remember the  authors recipe with the letters &quot;PEP&quot;.  Changes force an  individual into a &quot;protection&quot; mode (which is natural), but you  and I must understand that the protection wall is nothing buy  &quot;energy&quot; (but it is critical to understand the energy is not  positive nor negative--just energy).  Next is &quot;paradox&quot;--you and  I must continously engage in dialogue to help people understand why the  change is necessary--thus continuously engaging the protective energy. The  paradox is the more you engage the protective energy the more it becomes  &quot;positive&quot;--leading to the individuals support of change.  I have  used this recipe and it works--people do not wake up in the  morning--planning on how to oppose the future--they just want to  understand.

I've completed the first three books in the &quot;reengineering work&quot; 50List Series--and think Tom Peters did an outstanding job.  For those who read a great deal and believe in these principles to begin with--you may  only rate it a &quot;4-Star&quot;--but is still great book--just did not  get the &quot;aha's&quot; that someone who has not read as much may  receive.  His points are right on, and I totally agree with his point that  &quot;Knowledge Capital&quot; is key for the PSF--but is especially  important to each individual.  I love the point he makes that in a  PSF--&quot;the people are the only asset&quot;--not only to the  company--but, you the employee.  You have total control over your own  knowledge capital, and if your capital is strong enough--you can select the  employer with which to share your knowledge.  Dennis Waitley in  &quot;Empires of the Mind&quot;, comes to the conclusion, that in the  future, it will be the employee selecting the employer in which he/she will  share part of his working life.

However, this book, &quot;The  Project&quot; has the same Peters quality--but his 50-List could have been  shrunk to 20--it seemed as though he was just trying to meet the 50-List  title in the book series.  His material focuses on the small project--you  take it on--and you are still taking on a thread of of the organizations  DNA/culture.  I would still buy the book--it will just be a quick read for  you.	2000-01-15

Books	5	6	7	N	N	The usual &quot;Tom Peters&quot;--another outstanding performance!	If you are serious about engaging the future wholeheartedly--and welcoming the change to come--you will have many &quot;aha's&quot; reading this book.  I read a great deal--and this book draws many connections to &quot;just  doing the right and important things smarter and in a different mind  set&quot;--but in a prescriptive format.  As an avid reader of Theory of  Constraints, Project Management, Time Management, Eli Goldratt, Stephen  Covey, Ken Blanchard, etc...I wrote notes all over my copy of this book for  daily use.	1999-12-28
