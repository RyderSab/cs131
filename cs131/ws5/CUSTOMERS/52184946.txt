It will make you pay attention to the faceless immigrant who hands you your change at the local quickie mart, it will explain the evils of controlled monetary exchanges to you. It will force you to question the validity of prisons as a means of curing social ills when they create an evil of unsupervised bestial power in the people who run them.  It gave me much more insight into the Russian-Afghan war. It sent me to my first Bollywood movie, and it reminded me that romance is real and exists in every day life.   <br />   But don't let my use of the word romance deter male readers, or readers of both sexes who prefer substance and mindful consideration of the world in their reading.  This is no bodice ripper mind candy hackwork.  It is a gripping story of a man who lost his way in the world and of his journey. The story is well thought out, with knowledgable inclusion of the nuts and bolts of streetlife and the seamy world that coexists intertwined with 'legitimate' society.      <br />     The book was gripping, lush, and compelling.  I dreamed of wild dog packs and slums and joyous people who appreciate the vivid beauty of the world around them.  The concordant beauty of the prose in this book demanded that I appreciate life.  This book will infuse your life with an appreciation of the rich fullness of humanity.  Reading it could spoil you - - the next few books you read could have leaden prose compaired to the lyric vision of this book.  Reading it could enrich your life and demand that you SEE and FEEL the vibrant world around you, and that you PAY ATTENTION to the subcontinent of India.	2005-02-18

Cinderella was an avid spinster who didn't really want to marry the Prince, the magic that contributed to her appearance at a ball was a conspiracy of common happenings, the stepsisters weren't as greedy and selfish as the fairy tale makes them out to be, etc.  I like this story because it reminds us that there is a great difference between reality and what becomes public knowledge.  There are parallels between fairy tales and today's events that occur and become the grist of tabloids.  There are layers upon layers in the retelling of this common fairy tale.  <br />And that is as it should be.  As we grow up and become more mature, reality becomes more and more complex.  This truth is reflected in Maguires' retelling of a story that today still has female adherents waiting for their prince to come by and have them try on a slipper after a dance in a crowded disco with music too loud to do more than exchange written telephone numbers. I liked the imaginative setting for the story and the realistic reflection of realities that can come to pass in families. The story is familiar, now read what really happened!  Spend your money and your reading time on this novel - it's worth it.	2003-04-26

During the reign of Mary, Henry the 8th's eldest daughter, the Queen's husband sows his seed in one of the court's ladies as well as in the Queen, so that there will be a backup heir, should the queen get pregnant. The recipient of the King's attentions is married to a man whose secret love life renders him vulnerable to blackmail.  Lord Nelson's wife is given up to the mercies of the King so that Stuart Nelson may continue his forbidden love.  <br />Philippa Nelson becomes pregnant and is consigned to the care of Lionel Ashton, a member of the pregnancy conspiracy.  Philippa and Lionel fall in love in the midst of all the court conspiracies and plots.  Lord Nelson is not well portrayed, but well enough done for this type of novel.  Lady Nelson discovers that she has been the victem of a conspiracy, and Lord Ashton has to work hard to prove his love of her and that he is not motivated by the pregnancy conspiracy.  <br />Ok reading.  A standard romance.	2003-04-22

This is an interesting love story between species (Neanderthal/Human) and realities  (our current reality/Neanderthal-dominant).  I liked the contrast between the two civilizations.  This story might offend some in that the Neanderthal society portrays a family structure that some people might find offensive.  One of the points of the romance is that the human who falls in love with the Neanderthal also has difficulty with the Neanderthal family structure.   It would be a more believable story if the Neanderthal society were portrayed as having some warts.  Humans definitely come off as the less noble society.  Yes, the author is making a point in the novel to criticize humanity, and that is well written.  But it seems to me that every society will have problems and I would have liked to see the problems that the Neanderthal society might have.  <br />Actually, the Neanderthals are portrayed with much better characterizations than are the humans.  The Neanderthals are also much more Noble than the humans.  It's just a bit difficult for me to believe in Neanderthal Utopia.  This is the second book in a series, I did not read the first in the series and did not feel that I missed anything.  The writing was well enough done that reading the first book was not necessary in order to understand the events and personalities in this second book.  I will definitely be looking for the third book in the series.	2003-04-22

Abelard, Astrolabe's father, was the influential and charismatic leader of  a particular approach to theocracy that was challenged through the Heresy trial of the Bishop of Poitiers during the council of Reims. <br /> This book is part of  a series of novels about Catherine LeVendeur, a devout Catholic, whose family's Jewish roots, put her in peril.  Catherine is a well-educated middle-class wife, whose family is dependent upon their hidden Jewish connections in order to conduct business in silks and spices.  Catherine at one time, was attracted to convent life, and was well educated (for her time, and for a woman) in Latin and Church doctrine.  She is instrumental in resolving the mystery due to her background and her ability to be overlooked by clerics who feel that discussing things in Latin protects them from eavesdroppers.<br />I liked this book because the heroine was effective without violating the standards of female conduct for the time and place of the setting.  Sharan Newman is a consummate author and historian who makes history go down smoothly and as a pleasurable read.	2003-04-22

Out of a careless and addicted family that was plagued by accidental deaths and day to day chaos, Gregory Orr grew to be a poet.  His guilt at killing his younger brother caused him to examine each day and each experience with a keen appreciative eye.  His childhood, after the hunting accident that killed his brother, was a bleak landscape of depression and guilt.  And yet, he appreciates life and it's beauty.  <br />This is the story of how he overcame his desolate adolescence and threw himself into the Civil Rights movement  as blood payment on his sense of guilt.  He also analyses his parents' marriage and his father's addiction to speed that made his childhood so disorganized and unstable.  His survival of both childhood and barely avoiding becoming a civil rights martyr marks the beginning of his healing.  Living through the SNCC voting rights effort allows Orr to eventually make peace with himself and to record the beauty of what he sees around himself.  <br />A good book of a spiritual journey.   Well worth reading.	2003-04-22

The main character is deputy Pliny Pennington, a brooding singular individual who is both enthralling and scary.  It is the story of  a high school crush that becomes an obsession, possibly because the deputy is unable to consummate his loves as a result of an injury incurred in the Korean War.<br />Maggie Butler and her husband, Michael, are found dead in a wheat field.  Is it murder-suicide?  Or is it a double murder?    How are these deaths related to the hidden power structure within the county?  Slowly the deputy unfolds the intricate interweaving of the answers to all these questions.  The story is also a commentary on the hidden power structure in the United States and who belongs to the 'in' group, who chooses to NOT belong to the 'in' group, and who never would even be asked to join the power structure.<br />The unfolding of the tale is gripping.  Worth your time and money!	2003-04-13

The story is placed against the background of Mayfair Square in the first quarter of the 19 century.  We have the standard 'princess oppressed by her station, in love with a commoner' story.  Mayfair Square is also, apparently, the scene of more than one Stella Cameron novel.  This is a story to read when you don't want to think too deeply and are looking for a feel-good read.<br />The painter, Adam Chillworth, is in love with Princess Desiree, who returns his passion.  But the princess' station in life and the fact that Adam has been cut off from his family means that there are obstacles to a union of marriage.  Marriage is accomplished in order to resolve the Princess' problems, but opens the couple to further complications.  Of course, this is a romance, so the suspense resides in HOW the obstacles are overcome, not in whether or not they ARE overcome.  A nice bonbon!	2003-04-13

I loved the idea of basing the book on a true story, and even spent some time staring at the reconstruction of the victim.  But the whole story seemed to drag a bit and didn't engage my interest.

That said, the author does a good job of engaging interest in the characters and the actions that bring them all together.  <br />The head of a perfume company, Carson Brooks, was contracted 28 years ago to provide sperm to a rich feminist who wanted a child with no strings attached.  Brooks used the payoff to start his highly successful perfume company.  The rich feminist had her child, a daughter, who grew up to run a management consulting company.  Now, as the result of an attempted murder, Brooks is in need of a kidney transplant and his birth daughter offers the best hope of a match.  This is where things begin to be just too good to be true:  the birth daughter, Sabrina Radcliffe, immediately embraces her birth father's need for a transplant and offers her kidney.  There's a reason WHY many 'reunions' fail on first attempt; shock, the need to come to terms with the idea of a new individual who is intimately connected to your existing life.... Etc. But this story has the heroine immediately bouncing into a new relationship with her birth father with no reflective repercussions.  She also immediately falls in love with her father's attorney, Dylan Newport.  Story concludes with all the loose threads nicely tidied up.  An absorbing romantic read with all the stock characteristics!	2003-04-13

I like it because it is set IN the universe, and we get intimate glimpses into how the familial system works and a better sense of the social pressures that the members of its society feel.  Of course it's a romance with the usual obstacles to love.  But the interactions of the Laiden society make for an entertaining twist.  Recommended for die-hard romance addicts, as well as budding science fiction and fantasy readers.	2003-04-13

He's a good formulaic writer and this book is up to the usual standards of  his best selling books.  Lindsay Boxer, newly promoted from her rank in the first book of the series, is called to the scene of a church shooting where a child has been killed.  It is the beginning of multiple murders that are difficult to string together as the subjects of a serial killer.  It is only with the help of  the Woman's Murder Club that Lindsay is allerted to the fact that several apparently unrelated deaths have the same perpetrator.<br />Character development is focused more on the members of the Club rather than on the antagonist - - that's standard for this genre.  Plot development is contingent on the interactions of the members of the club with a few character insites for club members thrown in.<br />All in all, a police procedural that is light and entertaining.  And that's what you read James Patterson for.	2003-04-13

Kathryns on my 'authors to watch for' list.  This is an extraordinary fantasy well outside the standard fantasy-type plots. The book might almost be classified as mystical realism.<br />This is the story of a woman, Alma Montague, who comes 'home' to Lee Corners to retire and live out her life in peace. She left town when she was a young woman, and never returned until her retirement.  Part of the intriguing aspect of the novel is the question of what is 'real' Vs what might or might not be the imaginings of the heroine.  <br />Spend some time with this book, I found it to be a lovely elegy and a bit of comfort in grieving about a friend.	2003-04-13

BUT!  I have always liked Sharon Shinn's ability to make the setting of a story a believable influence on her characters.  The stratified society of Jane Eyre has been beautifully rebuilt in a universe where there are five levels of citizenship and the degree of privilege is commensurate with your wealth.  Of course, Jane is from the lowest level, but the plucky woman has certain skills that are the key to her plan to obtain full citizenship.  The isolation from the mainstream of society is replicated in the book by placing the manse in a closed mining community.  Well worth your time and money for the novel depiction of a different civilization.	2003-04-13

Sioned, an illegitimate sister of Richard the Lionheart, is the heroine of the novel.  Eleanor, queen mother of Richard, has used her black arts to ensure that Richard's Crusade against Saladin is successful.  Sioned works in the crusader's hospital, and does diplomatic work when Richard requires it.  Sioned rather inconveniently falls in love with a diplomat on the opposite side.  The novel revolves around Sioned's loyalty to her brother and her wish to be with Ahmad, Saladin's brother and prime Muslim negotiator with the Christian side.  Sioned is called upon to resolve the problems that Eleanor has created with her black magic when the consequences of the bargain that Eleanor has made with the demonic forces coincide with the Crusade to endanger the whole Crusade and the Crown of England.  A well written and absorbing alternate history fantasy that is worth your time.	2003-04-11

This time the help is needed by Annie Darling's shop assistant, who is the easy to target suspect for the murder of a painter who looked for financial security in marriage to a rich older woman.  The stand-in police chief is a little too fixated on the easy answer to who to suspect for the murder.  The denouement is a nice twist, but I wouldn't stay up all night reading the book.	2003-04-11

The rural class structure is in place, while the incipient apartheid society is being challenged with the civil rights movement.  The novel deftly contrasts racism and classicism that was (and probably still is) existent in rural Virginia.  <br />The heroine, Penny Bone, is alone - - her husband having been sent to prison for manslaughter that was the result of his throwing a full beer bottle out of a car and hitting a Negro teenage girl who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  John Bone ends up in jail primarily because he is poverty stricken and uneducated.  The town where the Bones lived is haunted by the long-ago disappearance of the first Negro child to integrate the town's school.  This disappearance is attributed to the 'Gypsy Man', a local legend who supposedly kidnaps and kills children.  Penny fears that the Gypsy Man will take Tory, the only thing she has from her brief marriage to John before he went to jail.  <br />The book turns on the contrast of classism and racism and whether or not the Gypsy Man does or does not exist.  It is a slow moving book that turns out to be totally absorbing.  The questions about class and race and balance of power and what people will do to maintain the balance will remain with you for quite a while.  This book would never make a best seller list, but it would be wonderful if many people read it.  Worth your time and interest.	2003-04-11

I liked that the female characters were presented with alternatives and choices that were consistent with the time the novel was set in.  <br />The plot twists and character interaction was delightful.  The madam, Addie French, is fully believable, as is the bank robber, Ned Partner.  Welcome, Addie's hired help, is a subtle but necessary character of the novel.

I read the first book by Scott-Zicree and thought it was ... OK; an interesting idea in which technology is replaced by magic.  Bohnhoff has taken the intrepid group of characters created by Marc, and imbued them with depth and interest.  I liked the fact that the flaws of the characters turn out to be strengths essential to the survival of the group.  I also liked the fact that she has imbued the romantic aspect of the novel with some surprises - the hero who gets the girl is not the obvious candidate. Definitely a worthwhile read	2003-04-11

All of the intimates of his life end up interacting when they are filling the holes that his death has left in their lives.  <br />Bridget Hansome, the wife of a husband with a wandering eye, deals with his mistress with admirable compassion and understanding. She is somewhat confused when a young man shows up, requesting assistance in her husband's name.  The novel turns on the interactions between the three people as they unravel the tangle of the errant husband's life.    The ability of all of the people to forgive and understand Peter Hansome's inability to be alone is written about in such a way that it is entirely believable.  No one in this novel has clear cut motives for their actions - - life is realistically muddled and tangentially approached.  <br />I liked the touch of magical realism present in the spirit of the husband.  The denouement was an excellent twist with several levels of interpretation - - including a direct jab at how people manage to fool themselves and prefer blindness (a lovely harmonic referral to one of the points of the novel; that you may need to chose to be blind to the faults of someone in order to love them).  An excellent read.	2003-04-10

But the authors did a very good job of developing characters and coherent plot.  I didn't expect anything along the lines of a serious historial novel, and so was not disappointed. I would almost classify this as a Young Adult book because the majority of the main characters are in the process of coming of age.  This is light fare that is well enough written and well plotted to engage your attention.  Very light on the fantasy element, and light on characterization - - but don't think that any of the characters are cardboard cutouts.

But this novel rises above the genre in its exploration of the consequences of sexual exploitation.  The character of the heroine is firmly grounded in the Victorian era, not a projection of today's female as a character projected into the past.  The Hero, while adhering to the genre's tendency to create men too good to be true, has some flaws that make him reassuringly closer to real life.  The villan's character is a well thought consequence of pathological need for control and power.  The supporting cast consists of characters that are well developed but who also remain within the mores and character of the time.  An enviable first novel.  Buy this book.

Well, cross those stories with  pot shots at several flavors of fanatic (Christian, Native American, and Marxist) fervor, mix with debate about cloning and you have this up to the minute science thriller.<br />The protagonists in this novel are: the unwary (duped) collegue <BR>Bryce Johnson, the grieving family member Veronica Tremaine, and an unknowing child/victem, Abel.  Supporting cast includes the FBI, a multinational physical anthropological research group, and intrepid reporters.  The Antagonists are a cardboard target: a Christian Fundamentalist group. <br />It's a good read with current anthropological debates and findings slipped easily into the text.  The Gears have done a better job of characterization of their protagonists and plotting in this novel than I have read in their other novels. But, the characters of the Antagonists are not sufficiently developed to show the complexity of the issues that are addressed in this novel.  While they based their characterization of the antagonists on tabloid headlines, they took the easy way out and moved from writing a good novel to an average novel that pits science against cardboard characters and simplistic views.But their writing is still good enough to engage the reader into caring for the protagonists.  Worth reading, and enjoyable.	2003-02-28

Sally Harrington is not dumb, just on her way to the maturity that comes with age and experience - - as are many of us.  Things happen TO Sally as a result of her intelligence mixed with a youthful inability to count the costs of her actions. Harrington has to deal with the mores, and current news events of life right now in the United States.  I like her new love interest, who is not the usual handsome cardboard foil for a romantic damsel in distress - - he's thinking about the consequences of commitment and partnership. The mystery is not confined to the consequences of the ageing US mafioso families, but also includes Sally's maturity. A lively page-turner that's 3rd in this mystery series that is firmly grounded in today's intricate personal mix of sex, work, and having to find a way to balance everything.  A good read.	2003-02-28

This book takes recent cognitive research findings and aligns it with the problems that autistics and other people with non-verbal learning disabilities have in correctly interpreting and responding to social  situations.  It was a fast read for me and very helpful in assisting me to  understand that there is a physical cause for inability to respond  appropriately to social situations by learning disabled people.  The book  actually gave me the intellectual key to forming an appropriate emotional  response to LD individuals and in assisting them in learning how to respond  appropriately to social situations. <br />Excellent discussion on eye contact  and interpreting actions.  Author also provides some interesting  observations on intra species communication and how it relates to the  evolution of human response in social situations. <br />Well worth the read if  you work with people who have non-verbal learning disabilities or have a  child with learning disabilities that encompass the spectrum of autistic  disorders.  Good tie in to language disabilities and discussion of temporal  and frontal region of the brain.  <br />Aimed at both professionals and the  lay person, the author has managed to do a good job of straddling both  worlds. <br />Recommended for those people who have managed to finally catch  their breath and are over grieving from discovering the consequences of  living with an LD individual, and who have managed to proceed to  formulating a program of education, personal and familial response to  non-verbal disabilities. <br />While the author made good points about eye  contact and subsequent social knowledge, he did fail to discuss those  social situations where eye contact would be considered to be aggressive  rather than a bonding or friendly situation.  Nor was there adequate  discussion of social groups where the types of eye contact he discusses  works opposite the general norm in the United States (ie:  Native American  Tribal culture).  <br/>Good material that serves as a starting point in  putting together an education program for those individuals who haven't  been able to absorb all those unwritten social rules which can make any  learning disabled person an outcast.	1999-05-20
