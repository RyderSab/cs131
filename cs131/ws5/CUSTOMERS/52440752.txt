This review covers the audio cassette book (2 tapes, 2.5 hours).  I was pretty excited in getting this audio book, full cast, new sound effects, original music, etc.  I just wish the story line would have been better.  Perhaps the hard-copy books were good...  It did have the feel of being over-edited.  Each tape starts off with a cap/re-cap of the story (as if this was originally intended for a mult-week radio broadcast...which it probably was).  The story takes place after \\"The Last Command\\" Thrawn book, and does a good job of filling in a lot of the details prior to \\"Jedi Search\\".  I found it very informative, just wish it hadn't spun through so quick.  What I get for an abridged version.  Anyway, the acting was decent, and I really like Billy Dee Williams' part.  Anyway, consider carefully before buying.	2005-05-11

The music score was great, the sound effects terrific, and the acting very good.  The plot...well that could take some time finding, but remember episdoe IV!  Anyway, I really enjoyed this story.  It takes place at about the same time as Ep. IV, and covers things more from the perspective of the Empire.  Well worth the purchase price.  I will have to see about getting the next two in the series.  I want to see what happens!	2005-05-11

Okay, really 3.5 stars.  This audio book had so much going for it: a great start, a terrific plot buildup.  Then...nothing.  It became overly predictable, along with a very rapid wrap-up.  The bad guys get waxed, everybody who needs it is rescued, and comes out the stronger, ad naseum.  Anthony Heald does his usual great job of voice characterizations (or I would have rated this much lower).  The sound effects and music are great, and expected.  Overall I would be cautious in the purchase of this audio book.	2005-05-11

Okay, I should have known better from the previous book, but I am a glutton for punishment.  Again, good audio, great special effects, excellent music score.  Lousy story line.  The only value I found with this book is that it explains a few of the things that happen between the Thrawn series and the Jedi Acadamy series.  I was probably mistaken in my last review about the over-editing, this just appears to be so-so writing.  Choppy story line, poor plot.  Overly powerful jedi, under powered dark-jedi (rediculous is the word I was thinking).  Two-second love interest...no, really!  Talk about your flash in the pan!  Consider carefully before buying this audio book!	2005-05-11

This was a pretty good tale, but, as an abridged version, it felt like some things were left on the cutting room floor.  Once again, Anthony Heald does a great job in acting out all the various characters.  The story line was weak and choppy.  It does, however, fill in some of the gaps between episodes V and VI, so worth listening to for that.  The sound-effects were well done, with the usual music score from the movies.  Worth the purchase price.	2005-05-11

This was a really good pre-SW Ep 1 movie.  It goes a long way to filling in a lot of the chess moves made prior to Trade Federation blockade of Naboo.  I felt that the story was a little rough in places, as though trying to keep track of one too many story tracks.  Alexander Adams does a very good job of acting out all of the parts, with the usual good music and sound effects blazing away in the background.  The audio is crisp and clear, and is easily heard in my car's stereo.  Well worth the purchase price.	2005-05-05

Let me start by saying that John De Lancie has a great gift for reading audio books and replicating all of the characters very well (even the women!).  If it had not been for him, I would have rated this book three stars.  The premise was a little vague.  On the one hand there were the physical limitations of how much matter could exist in the alternate universe, but on the other the Enterprise crew was trying to stop an invasion?  Perhaps some of the story ended up on the cutting room floor?  It seemed very weak to me.  Also, the crew does the usual pulling an improbable series of miracles out of a hat in order to win the day.  Predictable.  I enjoyed the special effects, quite good; they did not drown out the narration at any time, and added much to the story.  Hmmm, in retrospect, perhaps the story would rate two stars, and De Lancie actually brings it up to a 4?  If you like De Lancie, then buy this audio book, if not then the story is not worth the purchase.	2005-04-27

As usual Anthony Heald does an excellent job in narration.  If only the story had been better.  I get the distinct impression that the story (from previous reviews) was not all that good in the first place, and that several important bits may have ended up on the cutting room floor in this abridged edition.  The characters are well voiced by Heald, and this brought my review up a star.  Also, the special effects were very good with no drowning out of the dialog.  The most important part of this book is that it ties a few loose ends together of the overall Star Wars (post episode VI) arc.  Enough said.  If you like how Heald narrates books and you want a tie-together for the story arc, then this is the book for you.	2005-04-27

Jonathan Frakes did a great job reading this, he has a good voice, and does a credible job in recreating all of the characters.  The story itself was very engaging, but disconnected in a few places (not bad, but it was obvious that some things ended up on the cuttingroom floor).

I really enjoyed this story.  Sound effects were excellent, and the story line holds together quite well, even though obviously abridged.  Kevin Conway does a credible job acting out the various characters of the story.  I especially liked that this book ties together the \\"Generations\\" movie to the \\"First Contact\\" movie.  The portrayal of the Klingons was very good, however, the Cardassian roles were a bit fuzzy and less defined (as written).  The role of Scotty seemed more gratuitous rather than useful to the story line.  Overall, a really good STNG audio book.	2005-04-20

I was, overall, disappointed in this story.  The thought of Captain Sulu crawling around on hands and knees through ductwork was humerous (although Kirk did it at least once).  Takai sounds wooden in his acting role, and is at times drowned out by the sound effects (at least when listening in an automobile).  I did enjoy the story, but it jumps around a bit, and the thought of a Star Base or base of any kind easily being taken over is ludicrous.	2005-04-20

My one wish is that he had changed his voice so that the various characters would have been easy to pick out.  Peter David's story is one of his best, and I really liked how he portrayed the first generation's Trelane, very true to character.  Picard, and Q were also very well rendered.  The story line bounces around a bit, but is not too distracting (or confusing).  Sound effects and music are well done.  The audio is quite legible when listening in a car.  All-in-all a great audio book.  I highly recommend it!	2005-04-18

I was pretty disappointed with this audio book.  It sounded as if critical components of the story had ended up on the editing floor.  I had trouble following things.  For example, how exactly was Ghazi utilizing sub-space to reach his audience when everything pointed to radio waves being used?  The actor who played Ghazi carried the story; he was quite good and \\"into\\" his part.  Takai sounded wooden at times.  At one point the background sound affects and the music actually drowned out the Sulu's voice!  I found it a very mediochre audio book, and if it hadn't been for Ghazi it would have gotten a 2 star.	2005-04-18

Run time over 3 hours (2 cassettes).  Nimoy does a very credible job in reading this and portraying the various characters in the story.  Sound affects are excellent, and the music does not get in the way.  The story line does a great job of tying together some loose ends of Spock's past.  We find out what led to Spock joining Star Fleet and as an added bonus how he ends up in the diplomatic corp (sic. STNG - Romulans).  Even with jumping back and forth between past and present the story holds together quite well.  Anyway, I highly recommend this audio book, very enjoyable!	2005-04-18

The author assumes the reader has a very basic understanding of what is required and leads one by the hand (with nice graphics I might add) through some rough areas that the &quot;Using Dreamweaver UltraDev&quot; manual lacks.  Now, down to business.  The books format is a bit unusual.  Full screen snapshots of each step are included to demonstrate what the author is doing.  Each step is carefully spelled out and explained, with no assumed pre-knowledge.  The book is billed as beginner to intermediate level and I agree.  However, I am a long time user of the Front Page/Interdev world and have used Dreamweaver for some time now.  I found this book to be very useful for the final transition.  I found the examples easy to follow making my ramp time very rapid.  Even though I am advanced in this realm I highly recommend the book.  Ok, now with all of that aside, what does the author cover?  Here are some of the chapters I found useful.<br />The author starts with the basics of Ultradev and HTML development.  She covers managing websites and planning a database-driven website.  Server behaviors are given a chapter as are creating HTML forms.  The basics of ASP, displaying user friendly results, designing a database are also covered.<br />Now the good stuff:<br />Validating and Retrieving Form Data Retrieving Data from a Database Advanced Database Queries (I guess this got it the intermediated rating) Creating a Search Interface Creating Dynamic Form Objects (a fancy way of saying how to display your returned result sets) Messing with the database (i.e. Insert, Update, Delete) Creating Interactive Web Pages Sending Email Messages (using CDO)<br />Chapters that I questioned the need for were: Working with Files and Folders (i.e. writing to/from)<br />Finally there are several appendicies: Installing Dreamweaver UltraDev Installing Personal Web Server JSP and CFML Quick Reference (very useful) Additional Resources<br />If you are looking for examples of underlying ASP code there isn't much.  This book shows you how to create database interactive websites using the tools, with very few examples of under-the-hood tweaking.  A very useful beginner's book.	2000-11-12

It has been replaced by Installing Red Hat Linux 7 (same ISBN BTW)!  Now, that aside, here is a brief list of the TOC:<br />Introduction to Red Hat Linux - Discusses the various flavors of Linux and why you should use Red Hat :-).<br />Preparing Your System For Red Hat 7.0 - This is a really great chapter!  It talks about all three flavors of RH 7.0 (i.e. Workstation, Server, Custom), how to collect hardware information about your system, and how to set up dual-boot/multi-boot.<br />Beginning Your Red Hat Installation - How to set up your boot sequence, installing from the CD (not as simple as you would think), creating boot floppies, installing over a network, using virtual consoles.<br />Red Hat Installation:  Basic System Configuration - configuring your system (partitioning, formatting, network support, mouse, time zone).  Also goes into configuring your initial accounts, passwords, authentication (Root password, et. al.).  Completely de-mystifies these processes.  <br />Red Hat Installation:  Basic Software Installation - Covers selecting a group package for your chosen class (workstation, server, custom).  Selection of individual packages: application development, X windows, database development, office and word processing, other shells (i.e. BSD), and other servers like KDE and GNOME.  The author explains how you can locate the various packages, verify their dependencies, installing from command line or X windows, machine specific configurations, and creating boot disks.<br />Starting And Stopping Red Hat Linux - configuring the loader, booting, run levels, resolving startup problems (module and hardware), starting services, compiling your own modules, terminating services, shutting down.<br />Configuring And Customizing the X Window System - XF86, graphics cards/chips, Xconfigurator, starting, GNOME, KDE, windows managers.<br />Configuring Linux - system administration (linuxconf), network adaptors, nameserver, gateway/routing, hostname search path, printers (a really useful chapter).<br />Using Local and Network Storage - adding storage devices, partitions/disks, partitioning, file systems, swap space, removable media, using networked file systems, NFS, Samba.<br />Installing Other Software - RPM packages, RH Package Manager, viewing contents, installing and updating packages, removing, finding new, using packages from other Linux distributions (yay! somebody finally addressed this although it is brief).<br />All chapters are carefully laid out and explained walking you by-the-hand through difficult areas.  An excellent index rounds out the package.  198 pages.  A definite must for your Linux bookshelf.	2000-11-09

In the course of the robbery it  would appear that the bank clerk had been killed deliberately and $10,000  made off with.  Four men seem to have been involved, but none of the town's  people recognized the robbers.  Jim Bates, the banker, will be ruined if  Bowdrie doesn't catch the robbers quick.  What Chick doesn't know is that  the men will murder again to cover their trail.<br />Bowdrie Passes Through  (Currently out of print, you cannot obtain this one seperately):  Bowdrie  hurries to the town of Mesquite to help an old friend, Josh Pettibone, only  to find his friend in jail and Josh's kids under attack.  Josh is accused  of poisoning a fine mare belonging to Nero Tatum.  In the past Josh spent  time in jail because of run-in with Nero's brother Bugs.  It would appear  to the town of Mesquite that Josh was out for revenge, but Bowdrie doesn't  think that is the case.  An excellent story where Bowdrie plays the defense  attorney in a kangaroo court!<br />To Tough To Brand (Still in print  seperately):  Bowdrie is called in to investigate the disappearance of  $15,000 from the O-Bar-O owned by Lee Carnes.

Some of the chapters  include:<br />MTS and the Distributed Environment<br />Introducing MTS  Explorer<br />COM and MTS Architecture<br />Transaction Processing<br />Designing  MTS Components and Interfaces<br />Building MTS Components<br />Managing  Components and Packages<br />Implementing Security (a real biggy for  me)<br />Debugging MTS Components (another tricky subject, well  covered)<br />Administration<br />Data Services and MTS<br />MTS and the  Internet<br />COM+<br />Also included are a complete application (Sales Order  App) and an MTS type library reference (this was really nice to  have).<br />Downsides:  No CD-ROM and they really squashed the print in tight  in some places.  Everything is well laid out and explained clearly.  I have  found this to be one of my more used COM books.  A nice index rounds out  the whole package.  Well worth the purchase price.  A must have if you plan  on learning intermediate to advanced topics in VB and MTS.	2000-09-07

I found this to be an  exremely useful basic to advanced VC++ programmers manual/tutorial.  Every  topic is well explained and leads you by the hand through several difficult  areas.  The amazing part is that the authors cover everything including the  kitchen sink (i.e. Windows CE).  Topics covered include:<br />Windows, VC++,  and Application Framework Fundamentals:  Windows and VC++, MFC Application  Framework<br />MFC Library View Class:  AppWizard, Event Handling, GDI, Common  Controls, Dialogs, ActiveX, IE (albeit 4.0), Win32 Memory Management (an  extremely useful chapter for me), Bitmaps, Multithreading (another very  well written chapter on what could be a difficult subject)<br />The  Document-View Architecture:  Menus, Keyboard Acclerators, Rich Edit  Control, Property Sheets, Toolbars, Status Bars (and other basic stuff),  Reusable Frame Windows Base Class (a nice chapter), SDI, MDI, Printing,  Help, DLLs<br />COM, Automation, and OLE:  COM basics, Automation basics,  Uniform Data Transfer, Structured Storage, OLE: components and containers  (this is very well treated), Active Template Library basics<br />Database  Management:  ODBC, DAO, DB Templates<br />Programming For The Internet:   TCP/IP, Winsock, WinInet, Programming with IIS, ActiveX document servers,  Dynamic HTML basics, Windows CE<br />Appendices Include:  Message map  functions in MFC, and MFC library runtime class identification dna dynamic  object creation.<br />As you can see; this is exhaustive.  Examples are  plentiful and relevant and fairly bug free (I have actually used the CD-ROM  quite often).  A comprehensive index wraps up the whole book quite nicely.   This is a must have for anyone who is a beginner (and definitly for the  more advanced VC++ wannabes)!  Well worth the purchase price.	2000-09-07

The examples were relevant (and  not buggy - a definite plus, and useful!).  This is one book where I  actually used the CD-ROM instead of throwing it into a drawer (where most  of my Book/CD's end up).  I purchased the first inception of this book and  didn't know if getting an update would be necessary (the COM+ seemed of  little additional benefit).  I was glad I went ahead and got a copy.  Some  things have changed!<br />Some of the chapters covered:<br />COM/COM+  Internals<br />Understanding COM+ Objects<br />COM Servers<br />Apartments and  Multithreading (a real biggy with me)<br />Remote Activation<br />MTS Run-Time  Environment<br />Transactions<br />MMQ<br />Distributed Applications<br />Also covered  are Distributed COM+ basics, interface-based programming (101), internals,  and designing interfaces.

Then someone actually  gave me a copy as a gift.  Well, I was then obligated to read it.  Glad I  did!  Of all of the alternate universe stories that I have read (i.e. L.  Sprague de Camp, Harry Harrison) this one did not disappoint.  Turtledove  does a great job of making his characters believable.  I especially enjoyed  General Lee.  The author, I felt, was very true to the historical man. I  found the ending to be a little weak, a bit pat, and very quickly wrapped  up (i.e. all-in-all disappointing).  The Rivington Men, men out of time,  had gone back 150 years to change the outcome of the Civil war for  mysterious purposes.  They brought with them many weapons from the future  which they presented to Lee's army.  At first with no strings attached, but  later...things change.  Among the weapons were thousands of AK-47's  complete with ammunition and training by the men from the future.  With  weapons like these, Lee could reverse the fortunes of war to the South's  favor.  I wish that the author had spent as much time on the ending as he  did developing his characters, giving them depth and believability only to  rush to the finish.  However, if you are looking for a good alternate  universe/timeline book.  This is a good read and well worth the purchase  price.	2000-09-06

Deadwood is way outside of Texas, and Chick must bring  him back cross country.  The only problem is that the rest of the gang is  still at large and gunning for Chick.  Louis L'Amour does an introduction  on the town of Deadwood.<br />A Trail West - A gang has kidnapped the daughter  of a Texas judge to keep him from sentencing one of their own in prison.   Chick is sent to retrieve her.  Or die trying!  This one ends up in  Arizona.  Louis L'Amour does and introduction on women of the west (which  was very interesting) (BTW-this one is out of print now and can only be  obtained with this set).<br />Where Buzzards Fly - Chick is sent to  investigate a big robbery that has happened in west Texas only to find that  the robbers have been murdered (all fourteen of them) and the loot has  vanished without a trace.  Chick must trail them with his mind and his  wile.  Louis L'Amour does an introduction on gunfighters (some of which he  had actually met).<br />All three dramatizations are well cast.  The special  effects are excellent.  The audio is crisp and clear and easily understood  in the noisy environment of a car.  Well worth the purchase price.  Run  time:  180 minutes.	2000-08-30

He actually got to meet several.<br />I found this story to be  relatively easy to follow.  Chick Bowdrie is heading west in Texas to  investigate a very large theft.  He come upon the scene of a battle  recently over.  Fourteen border outlaws lie dead in a small arroyo.  The  clues are few and the tracks: none.  Chick begins tracking them in his mind  and starts to uncover a very elusive gang of men who will murder to obtain  their goal.  As usual, L'Amour writes a captivating tale.  The voice  characterizations are well cast and the audio is crisp and clear; easily  understood in a car environment.  The special effects are great (bullet,  horse, etc.).

Robert Vieira has written the Transact-SQL  programmer's dream.  Not only is it a good reference for the more advanced  DBA, but makes a decent beginner's guide (the book is not a &quot;teach  yourself&quot;, but rather for a beginner who has completed some SQL Server  basics).  This is the book for the beginner who wants to move through  intermediate to advanced topics.  The book covers:<br />I.   Particulars and  History - Building DB Connected Systems, Data Access Models.<br />II.  RDBMS -  The components of a SQL Server DB<br />III. Tools of the Trade - Client/Server  Network Utilities, Enterprise Manager, DTS, MS DTC, Performance Monitor,  Profiler, Query Analyzer, OSQL, Service Manager<br />Then The Good  Stuff:<br />First the basics:<br />IV.  The Foundation Statements of T-SQL -  Select, Where, ETC.<br />V.   Joining Tables - Inner/Outer, Cross, Full,  Union<br />VI.  Creating and Altering Tables<br />Then the Intermediate  Stuff:<br />VII. Constraints - Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Unique, Check,  Default, Disabling, Rules, Triggers<br />VIII.Normalization and Basic Design  Issues - Relationships, Diagramming, De-Normalizing, Examples<br />Then the  Advanced Stuff:<br />IX.  Speeding Performance:  Storage and Index  Structures<br />X.   Views - Simple, Complex, Editing, etc.<br />XI.  Writing  Scripts and Batches - OSQL<br />XII. Code Storage:  Stored Procedures -  Intermediate to Advanced - This is pretty much exhaustivly covered.   Includes error handling, control of flow.<br />XIII.Transactions and Locks -  More advanced SProc handling, Checkpoints, Locks and Concurrancy, Handling  Deadlocks<br />XIV. Triggers - A truely great chapter, untangling what is  usually a badly explained subject.<br />And a lot more...  Chapters 15 through  25 cover the really advanced subjects like: Advanced Queries, Distributed  Queries/Transactions, SQL Cursors, BCP, DTS, Replication (in detail),  Advanced DB Design, OLAP (in detail), English Query and Full Text Search,  Security (very well done), Performance Tuning (in detail), Advanced  Administration.<br />The appendices cover:  Global Variables, Functions,  Tools, Error Listing, Access Upsizing.  An excellent index rounds out the  package.  If you are worried about coverage on any of the above  topics...don't the book is a real luggable (1.5&quot; thick, a couple of  pounds in weight).<br />The only other book I would recommend to round out the  SQL Server DBA's library would be MS Press' Administrator's Pocket Guide.   You really won't need anything else!  This book is a must have.	2000-08-24

First, this is not a &quot;teach yourself book&quot; it is a reference,  geared toward field engineers.  With that said, this is a fabulous carry  everywhere reference (small; roughly 8&quot;x5&quot;x1&quot; in size) that  has just about everything you need to know (from a DBA perspective, that  is) for maintaining/installing/etc. SQL Server 7.0.  The book is broken  into four sections: <br />I.  Administration Fundamentals - Configuring and  Tuning<br />II. Administration - Managing Enterprise, Core DBA,  Security<br />III.Data Administration - Backup/Recovery, Import/Export,  Distributed Data/Remote Servers, Replication<br />IV. Performance,  Optimization, and Maintenance - Monitoring/Profiling, Creating  Tables/Indexes, DB Automation/Maintenance<br />Having worked with SQL Server  for several years now, I have always dreamed of having a book that  summarized (with examples) all aspects of installation and maintenance (and  wasn't a 4&quot; thick luggable).  Stanek has done it.  The contents are  well laid out with a very thorough index.  Examples are well laid out  (step-by-step) to get you through what-ever issue you are working with.   The book contains stored procedure calls, but is not a Transact-SQL manual  (actually it would be nice if the author would come out with a T-SQL Admin  Pocket Guide also!).<br />I consider this a must-have for every SQL Server  DBA's library.  It will not gather dust, but instead become VERY dog-eared.	2000-08-24

A country side mansion is a common gathering point  for several of the upper crust of British society.  One of the guests  invites a friend of his over to meet the host.  As the friend arrives the  host suddenly dies behind a locked door.  Foul play is immediately  suspected, but the police are stumped.  Somewhat formulaic, this mystery  had a couple of unexpected twists and turns which kept me guessing, until  near the end, what had happened to the host (yes, even the manner of his  death is mysterious).  I was pleasantly suprised when I realized that all  of the data to solve the mystery had been there all along, but I had missed  it!  This smacked a little of Christie and Holmes wrapped together (perhaps  an unfair comparison, but I did enjoy this book).  Well worth the purchase  price.  156pp.  I wish there had been more books like this from the author.   A shame.	2000-08-07
US	52440752	R1OIG6CA44BAFW	0781430550	27714888	The Picture Bible	Books	5	8	9	N	N	The Old Pix Consolidated	I originally grew up and attended church in the North East.  Among the Sunday School materials distributed was a little pamphlet called Pix.  Almost every week Pix would contain a couple of pages of the Bible rendered  in cartoon.  Cook publishing has taken most of these and compiled them into  one volume (yes, I still have some of the original Pix even after 30 years  and I have found a few installments to be missing from this Bible, not a  biggy as everything of importance is there, especially the Gospel message).   I found that my children really didn't start getting into the  pictures/stories until they were around four so you may want to gauge  accordingly (some of th pictures/themes presented are complex for younger  ages).  Even though this Bible is in cartoon form there are plenty of  references to the actual Bible so that if you question something you can go  look it up (a feature I like a lot).  In addition there is an  &quot;Index&quot; of scripture at the end.  Matthew through John are  condensed into one &quot;book&quot;, and the New Testament as a whole is  paired down (this is obvious as the &quot;story&quot; content is rather  lacking, i.e. letters of Paul, Peter, John).  Hebrews through Revelation  covers only three pages (I wished they hadn't done this, Pix covered  Revelation quite well and they should have included all of the original  pages, instead it gets about 2/3 of a page).  Included are several  historical/archealogical tidbits scattered throughout.  I consider this a  must have and would definitely like to see a fully exhaustive update with  every cartoon from Pix included.  Well worth the purchase price (for adult  or child)!

Kit Carson was a man of few words in life and in his own autobiography.  It is unfortunate that such a dynamic individual didn't write down more!   Quaife does a terrific job with the notes.  Explaining everything that  Carson failed to include.  This is a common problem as, for example, Kit  Carson will say something to the effect:  Fought indians today, and Quaife  will fill in all of the details about what tribe, how many, who was killed  or wounded in both parties, etc.  I am fascinated by how much detail is  known of Carson's time.  Very readable, my only complaint was that it was  too short!  The editor has included a nicely laid out index.  I found the  book well worth the purchase price!  BTW, for those of you looking for  information on William F. Drannon, he is not mentioned anywhere in Carson's  autobiography.	2000-07-18

Starting with  Columbus and working through to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the  authors take details from newspapers, books, diaries and other materials of  the times and weave a story of Christianity and the founding of the United  States.  They show that the two were intertwined and not meant to be  separated.  A drawback to this kind of writing is that it can not be taken  as a serious history text, but rather as a historical overview or treatise.   In other words, there is a significant amount of personal comment from the  authors.  I found quite a few places where the authors imagined comments or  scenes about people; what they thought or did.  This is unfortunate and  caused me to downgrade the book slightly.  However, these parts are well  written (as is the whole book) and do not detract.  Well worth the purchase  price.	2000-07-18

This  installment carries on from where the first left off.  Starting with the  Constitutional Convention in 1787 and moving through to 1830 the authors  spend a considerable amount of time on a much shorter piece of American  history (the first book covered over 300 years).  Again the authors  concentrate on re-introducing the reader to history that has been recently  omitted from our now politically correct historical texts.  The authors  take details from newspapers, books, diaries and other material of the  times and weave a story of Christianity and how the founders wove it into  the fabric of the early United States government.  The authors once again  introduce a drawback by adding personal conjecture and subjective comment  (nullifying the book as a true historical text).  However, this does not  detract from this book being entertaining and informative reading.  I  especially enjoyed the bin on Thomas Jefferson as a Deist and his personal  agenda upon becomming President.  In addition I found the diary information  from both sided in the War of 1812 to be fascinating.  I also was left with  a much greater appreciation of how God moved in the early days of the  United States.  Well worth the purchase price.	2000-07-18

Having been in the HTML world now for a number of years, I am constantly looking for better references and tutorials.  Elizabeth Castro has done both with this excellent book on HTML.  Again and again I find myself  turning to this book to find ways of doing things that I used to do in  JavaScript (the &quot;Gee I Didn't Know HTML Would Do That!&quot;  syndrome).  What I like most is the format of the book; an excellent index  allows the reader to easily look up specifics.  The book contains some of  the following chapters:  Text Formatting, Images, Layout, Links, Lists,  Tables, Frames (a big problem area for a lot of web programmers, well  presented and explained here with some pretty neat hints and tips), Forms,  Style Sheets (happily, this is heavily explained with four chapters  dedicated to it's many facets), Scripts (wow!  An HTML author who finally  admits there are other languages out there!  The author even spends a  little time on the basics of JavaScript, however, she stays true to the  focus of the book, only showing enough to wet the appetite before moving  on), debugging (this is another biggy rarely covered by HTML authors, again  well done here).  The author spend some time even on publishing a web site.   The problems and solutions to getting:  a domain name, web host,  transferring files, getting listed on search engines, etc.  Several  appendices:  Tools, Special Symbols, Colors, and Tag Compatibility are  covered.  The index is very well done.  This book is a must buy for any  serious web developer.	2000-07-17

I'm not certain really where it belongs.  The author fails to explain some things; as if taking it for a fact that the reader is a person with some  experience.  Now, bashing aside, I found the book useful in several cases.   Fireworks is an awesome tool, especially when used in conjuntion with  Dreamweaver.  However, Fireworks is not an end-all be-all.  Some of the  &quot;side effects&quot; or quirks, ascribed to the book in previous  reviews, are actually Fireworks doing.  Where the author fails is in  explaining these anomolies.  The book is organized well with a chapter for  each of the following subjects:  Basics, Document Setup, Colors, Path  Tools, Selecting Paths, Working With Objects, Fills, Strokes, Effects,  Text, Automation, Pixels, Importing, Optimizing (this is really good),  Animation, Hotspots/Links, Slices (a difficult subject, made easier by the  author.  I spent a lot of time here), Behaviors, and Exporting.  There are  appendices for:  Defaults, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Regular Expressions.  A  decent index rounds out the book.  I would have liked more in-depth  information on connecting JavaScript to objects and also some of the  pitfalls of integrating Fireworks projects into Dreamweaver, or integrating  Flash objects into Fireworks.  If you want to learn how to use Fireworks,  then my suggestion is to go through the Tutorial included with the  downloadable (and Full) versions of the product.  If you would like to  expand your knowledge or perhaps fill in the gaps, then this book is good  for that.  However, I suggest that readers check out the &quot;Fireworks 3  Bible&quot; as a better buy.	2000-07-17

I would suggest a good book on JavaScript (for those sketchy in this area), an then a good book on HTML (again for those beginning to learn to Web program).  DHTML is a  combination of intermediate to advanced HTML and JavaScript.  Now with that  said, this book does a good job presenting DHTML clearly.  Here is a list  of some of the topics covered:  Cascading Style Sheets (basics, fonts, text  control, properties, margins, borders, positioning, ad-nausium...), DOM  (Document Object Model), Dynamic Techniques/Solutions, JavaScript and  DHTML, Layers (a real biggy for me), and Visual Controls.  Both Netscape  and the ubiquitous Internet Explorer are covered (with a couple of chapters  specific to their uniqueness).  Appendices include:  CSS Quick Reference,  Layers QR, and Resources.  The book is rounded out with an excellent index.   I especially liked all of the cross-browser information (comments, code  techniques, what would work and what wouldn't, how to adapt).  I would have  liked to have seen more on JavaScript integration with visual controls, but  oh well.  In addition, more information on CSS techniques with JavaScript  would have been nice, and when dealing with IE it would have been terrific  to have had some VBScript comparison code.  Overall, I would recommend this  book for the serious web programmer's shelf.	2000-07-17

There is not much I can add to other reviews.  However, the audio book is abridged and some of the story seems to skip forward at high speed.  Once  again Anthony Daniels (C3PO) does a great job reading.  His voice  characterizations are the same as in &quot;Dark Force Rising&quot; allowing  the listener to keep the many characters straight and concentrate on the  plot(s).  The audio and special effects are crisp and clear and easily  understood in a car environment.  The best of the three books and well  worth the purchase price.  Run time:  180 minutes.	2000-07-16

With Anthony Daniels (C3PO) things have improved considerably.  Daniels has a  much better reading voice.  He has great voice characterizations allowing  the reader to easily keep the many characters straight.  Once again the  special effects are excellent (blaster fire, star ship engines, etc.).  The  audio is crisp and clear in a car environment.  Timothy Zahn continues the  story of the fledgling New Republic.  Admiral Thrawn (of the Empire) is the  last surviving Grand Admiral, and his plans to bring down the New Republic  are slowly culminating.  In addition to that threat the NR has also to deal  with a new Dark Jedi.  Zahn does a great job with the old &quot;wheel  within a wheel&quot; type story.  There are several (but not too many)  threads running through the book that make it very entertaining and keep  you longing for more.  Well worth the purchase price (I can't add anything  more to the publisher's review).  Run time:  180 minutes.	2000-07-15

Denis Lawson (Wedge Antilles) does a credible job with the characterizations, well enough for the listener to keep the various characters straight.  His voice does not  drone (important while driving)!  Timothy Zahn has woven a terrific tale of  the newly re-founded Republic and their struggle to survive the remnant of  the now beaten Empire.  Or is it beat?  Admiral Thrawn is simply amazing  (it is difficult to write about someone as being intelligent and actually  having him be that way).  I can add little more to the publisher's notes on  the story.  The audio and special effects are crisp and clear.  Run time:   180 minutes.  Well worth the purchase price!	2000-07-14

Dr. Padway's character is  thoughtful and intelligent (being so and writing him that way are two  entirely different things showing off deCamp's brilliance at character  development).  This Conneticut Yankee (Padway), instead of lamenting his  predicament (i.e. being catapulted to 500 a.d. at about the moment Rome  falls for good), immediately goes about to see if he can change history  (ah, parallel time line development), and finds out how tuff that can  really be.  Even making friends you can trust is a bit of a challange.  The  only thing I find wouldn't work today is that in deCamp's time they still  taught Latin in the grade/high schools/colleges as required material so  that Dr. Padway at least has some familiarity with the language in the Rome  of otherwhen and allowing him to overcome that &quot;very&quot; nasty  barrier with some ease.  A highly recommended book.	2000-07-14

Normally I am not a Daley fan, disliking the Coramande stories, and if it had not been for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; title I  probably would not have given it a second glance, but I'm glad I did.  All  three stories stand on their own, but together weave a great saga-like  tale.  The best (I feel) of the three is the first:  Han Solo at Star's  End.  The publisher's description does not do it justice, I feel it is  movie material.  The story's ending is very well written, you feel as if  you are there with Han fighting the Empire.  &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; is the  second best, but just a bit &quot;outside&quot; Han's character and a bit  too spectacular.  Overall, this is a great series of books wrapped  (finally) into one.  Well worth the purchase price.	2000-07-14

The reader (an unknown man) does a good job in reading, but has a voice that will knock you out (asleep that is,  not a good thing while listening and driving).  I have yet to get all the  way through.  This is not recommended unless you have insomnia and are  listening at home.  The book urges the reader to pray, covering various  experiential reasons to do so (some Biblical references are thrown in, but  not enought to my liking, oh well).  Pass this one by, there are better  audio books out there.  Run time:  90 minutes.	2000-07-13

I was pleasantly surprised to find this an excellent &quot;read.&quot;  The book is read by  a man (unknown) who does a good job without a boring voice to the listener.   Starting with Bunyan's childhood experiences, to serving in Cromwell's  army, to finding the Lord, to serving Him in prison is a terrific story.   Somewhat humbling (like Pilgrim's Progress).  Anyway, well worth the  purchase price.  Run time:  about 60 minutes.	2000-07-13

I gave it &quot;four stars&quot; because of this.  Otherwise the story is a &quot;three star tale.&quot;  The synopsis above does a good job of  describing what happens.  Scotty is one of the &quot;officers&quot; trapped  on the shuttle and Doohan reading the part of his own character comes off  very well (as you should expect), not to mention that his  &quot;solution&quot; of the KM scenario is rather interesting.  This  &quot;book&quot; would have been even better if there had been some sort of  special effects (like background noise in the shuttle, or engine sounds  while telling the KM stories).  I recommend it, but there are better  stories out there.  Run time: 90 minutes.	2000-07-13

It is obviously trimmed back from the written version, but still contains the mainstream content (all of the most important martyrs are  present).  Foxe, a significant figure in the Protestant Reformation, was an  eye witness to many Christians being killed for their faith (both  Protestant and Catholic).  This persecution lead him to delve into other  persecutions throughout the Church's history with the result being this  book.  The audio is read by a woman (unknown) who has a clear speaking  voice and comes across without boring the listener.  Well worth the  purchase price.  Run Time: 90 minutes.	2000-07-13

The stranger comes out on top and everyone is  convinced that the he is Kilkenny, the famous gun-fighter.  The stranger  does not correct their misconceptions.  The town to show it's grattitude  begins offering free food and services, and the stranger stays, but there  are those who know how Lance Kilkenny operates and the stranger's behavior  does not jive with their knowledge.<br />A great story made better with crisp,  clear audio, special effects and well cast characters.

Sometimes it seems that Louis L'Amour was scratching around for a story  line.<br />The main character, Jim Gary, has been away from home for some time  and is slowly drifting back when he joins up with some men running cattle.  But, something isn't right with the setup, and as the days pass, Jim  wonders how he can extract himself.  Then one night, during a storm,  hearding cattle, Jim's whole world is turned upside down.<br />The audio is  crisp and clear, and easily heard in a car environment.

At first I didn't like the characterization of  the hero, but after listening a couple of times that went away.  The story  is about Jeff Kurland, a young kid trying to scrape out a living raising  cattle in the high country.  Living hand to mouth with just a few head of  cattle and trying to impress one of the local ranchers to let him marry the  rancher's daughter (sound a little formulaic?  It isn't!).  Winter is  setting on and an escaped killer is on the loose.  Jeff gets trapped in his  cabin (with the killer) when the pogonip snow falls...and the story begins!

Marshal Fitz Moore sees a strange grey horse with an unfamiliar brand tied  up out back of town early one morning and it sets off a series of events  that get him in deep trouble!

It is simply amazing to me  how many times the so-called &quot;Harvard School of Business&quot;  techniques are used to manage an OO project!  I have learned through the  school of hard knocks what Booch has written about in this book (wish I had  discovered it sooner, a couple of pointy haired bosses could have used  it!).  Anyway, Booch breaks OO management into seven chapters:  First  Principles, Products and Process, The Macro Process, The Micro Process, The  Development Team, Management and Planning, and Special Topics.  I  especially found interesting his descriptions on how NOT to run an OO  project (oh, and he gives plenty of examples on HOW to run one too!).   Booch covers OOA, artifacts, OOD, methodolgies (a biggy with me even on a  one person project), evolution (gosh! who would have thought you could have  cyclical development???).  Identification of classes, objects, symantecs,  relationships, etc.  He then tackles the team environment:  roles and  responsibilities (especially the manager's responsibilities!), resource  allocation, and tools (this book is not a plug for Rational Rose BTW).   Finally:  managing risk, planning and scheduling, staffing, costing (a  tough one), Quality Assurance (this is not testing!), and he talks some  about projects in crisis and what to do.  The last chapter is kind of a  catch-all containing:  User-centric, Data-centric, and Computation-centric  systems discussions, along with Distributed, Legacy, Information  Management, and Real Time Systems.  The appendicies contain: a summary of  recommended practices (for those wanting to create a methodology), and  rules of thumb.  There is a great index, bibliography and glossary to tie  up the package nicely.  Booch has a terrific writing style presenting what  would normally be a dry subject!  Definitely for the computer Project  Manager's shelf!	2000-07-07

This is the book you need for helping you write proposals (consultants take note).  Tom Sant does a great job of presenting a difficult subject giving plenty of examples that you will find very  useful (a CD with all of the examples would have made this 5+ stars).  The  author starts by giving you a short lesson on how to be a pursuasive writer  (there are lots of hints and tips here): how to pursuade, you as a source,  establishing credibility, and writing to your audience.  Proposal  development is then covered in detail:  the process, getting organized,  etc.  Finally, the proposals:  Letter Proposal, Formal Proposal, Research  Proposal, Grant Proposal (with at least two and sometimes three examples of  each; I especially liked the fact that I had three Executive Summaries to  examine).  The author also speaks on automating your process and adding  bells and whistles to dress up the proposal.  A pretty good index wraps up  the package.  An additional appendix with a propsal writer's checklist is  included.  I consider this book to be a must have for every manager doing  proposals.

The book is edited by Sue Mosher (of MS Outlook 2000 Programming in 24 Hours fame).  Byrne (the author) does a good job of  laying out the &quot;world&quot; starting with brief (30 pages)  introduction of Outlook, some examples of what you can create, and the  various design tools.  Next comes a quick guide to building applications  followed with a full blown example (which BTW works).  Other sections cover  building forms (controls, fields, properties, actions, folders, events,  outlook and command bars, the assistant), VBA and VBScript (this BTW is  where you will spend most of your time wearing the book out), and how to  distribute (and maintain) applications.  Byrne then goes on to advanced  topics like COM Add-ins, Home Pages, Data Access, ActiveX, MTS, and  Exchange Server scripting objects.  To top it off a CD with complete code  examples is included.  The book literally paid for itself shortly after  coming in my door.  The only thing I wish it had examples of is Javascript  for which there are nil, but this is Outlook afterall!	2000-07-06

Mosher does a great job narrating a pretty dry subject.  I found the code snippets to be correct and applicable (I still use some of  the examples in my production code).  If you want to learn about Outlook  programming (and why you should program Outlook) this is the book to take  you to the intermediate level.  Subjects covered: form design, the VBA  environment, coding basics, special Outlook techniques (Object Models,  Custom Actions, Stores and Folders, Items, Events, Menus, Toolbars),  debugging (a biggy), ActiveX and other controls, reports (some are pretty  limited, but not the book's fault), and the author even touches on Exchange  Server and Data Collaboration.  A pretty good index ties things up nicely.   This is not an advanced book or a reference, but a tutorial.  A very good  buy.  No CD, but I found the code examples to be no big deal to type  in...after all this is Outlook we are talking about!	2000-07-06

His voice (and the special effects) are crisp and clear.  Heald is good at characterizing the voices so that each character is distinct and easily recognizeable.   Anderson's books are great although at times difficult to follow (and a bit  spread out over the place), but still enjoyable.  I liked/disliked...the  jury is still out...the idea of having the Jedi Academy where it is, but it  seems to work and is well woven into the story structure.  The author is  very true to the characters from the movie(s).  Run time is 540 minutes.   Well worth the purchase price.	2000-07-05
US	52440752	R30LZ2IP4VS59	0671890093	421041583	To the Stars: The Autobiography of George Takei, Star Trek's Mr. Sulu	Books	4	6	8	N	Y	Good Listening	(This Review is for the Audio Version of the Book).  Mr. Takai does an excellent job of narrating his own autobiography injecting a personal note into the book.  He is a clear speaker easy to understand even in the  noisiest of (car) environments.  The first tape covers George's life  &quot;before Star Trek&quot; talking mostly about his life in the  &quot;camps&quot; during WWII.  I especially found this interesting as I  knew little of what this was about.  The second tape talks about George's  Star Trek life.  The people he met and how he felt about them.  His take on  William Shatner is especially interesting!  A very enjoyable set of tapes.   3 hours.	2000-07-05

I have a copy of War Party so am familiar with the original story.  This is similar, but unwinds like a movie!  Great audio characterizations and special effects.  Clear and crisp  and easily heard in a car environment.  The story line is about a  mail-order bride who has trouble adapting to her new way of life...and  husband.  She runs away and then night falls.  Then she meets a stranger...   Excellent buy!	2000-07-05

Stephen Covey does a good job reading  his voice is crisp and clear even in the noisy environments of a car.   Covey breaks out the seven most effective habits used by successful people  and makes them easy to understand and incorporate into your own life.  2hr  30min.  Worth listening to.	2000-07-05

The book is easy to follow and stays pretty true to the original Star Trek characters, but I found the plot hard to follow (swallow)  sometimes.  The audio is nice and clear (even the special effects) in a  noisy car environment.  Nimoy and Doohan are the only redeaming factors in  a otherwise unmemorable book.  3 hours.	2000-07-05
US	52440752	R2OEMUYB7OJUT7	9996935906	322169714	Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Excellent Reloading Manual	This is the &quot;basics&quot; of metallic cartridge reloading.  All of the mainstream (and some of the not so mainstream) cartridges are here.  I personally load several different types (both rifle and pistol) and  constantly consult these two volumes for information on SAFE reloading.   The first volume covers the actual reloading information while the second  covers ballistics.  I like how the ballistic information is presented by  calibre and then grain of bullet, this allows me to easily find what I  want.  Finally, I like the graphics of the various bullets, even if I am  not shooting Hornady rounds I can look up the equivalent weight and  beginning working up a round for my bullet.  The covers appear to be very  durable (I have had my set for a couple of years now).  Well worth the  purchase price.	2000-07-05

His characterizations are clear (as are the special effects) and easy to recognize (a must when narrating a long story).  Brooks does a great job in  filling out the characters (something the movie fails to do) and you get a  real sense of being there.  The &quot;race&quot; was especially good. 9.5  hours.  Well worth the purchase price.	2000-07-05

However, trying to find more recent model guns has been dismal.  For example try to find any of the new Sig Sauer  pistols or any of the new Derringers!  Anyway, I have identified a couple  of H&amp;R pistols (pretty neat trick, good black and white photos helped  tremendously) and a couple of rifles (one a Winchester rifle and you know  how many flavors of those exist!) again by picture then description.  I  like how the book is broken into three sections (pistol, rifle, shotgun).   The pistol part is broken into semi-auto then revolver for each company  presented.  I would have liked to have a more comprehensive breakout of new  weapons (as I mentioned before) and more information on the various  companies (some had nothing but an address...if that), but all in all a  must have books for my library.  A good buy.	2000-07-05

Crisp clear audio, good character voices by the actors.  Excellent audio special effects.  All easily heard in the environment of a car.  The story is great  also:  four ranchers had settled an old grant...legally, when suddenly a  young Mexican brings in a few head and claims some of the range.  Things  begin to fly apart after that.  Then the rain quits falling and things  begin to dry up...  An excellent buy!	2000-07-05

This short story has been seriously enhanced with actors and special effects (listen carefully for wind noises in the background).  Everything is well  presented.  The sound is clean and crisp and easily heard in the noise  environment of a car.  The story itself is very well laid out and flows  nicely.  The story is about a would-be rancher (Mac Marcy) who buys a  two-bit ranch on high, dry ground and begins to run a couple of hundred  cattle (for which he has saved several years).  Things are complicated by a  rich next door ranch and a serious lack of rain.  Enough said.  You feel as  if you are there.  An excellent buy.	2000-07-05

The voice characterizations and audio special effects are excellent.  Clear and crisp and easily heard in the environment of a car.  You feel the bullets whipping by!  The story line is about Chick  Bowdrie riding to Deadwood to pick up a prisoner.  He meets a girl (of  course) and things get a lot more complicated.  Especially since the  prisoner has friends trying to break him out!  Chick has his hands full (as  usual)!  A great buy!	2000-07-05

A crisp clear rendition of the book with good special effects, BUT a boring boring boring story.  I made it all the way through (90 minutes), but almost not worth listening to.

However, this particular book does a credible job spinning a story around a resurrected B-52 fleet.  Joseph Campanella's voice characterizations are quite good and easily  recognizable allowing the listener to keep the many characters straight  while concentrating on the story line.  The audio is crisp and clean making  for easy listening in a high noise environment.  I especially enjoyed  Brown's geographical description of Taiwan, and warfare between China and  Taiwan.  However, landing a modified B-52 in Taiwan where they did...naw.   Anyway, 6 hours.	2000-07-05

Monaghan covers many of the battles I had tried in vain to locate details on.  Covered are the battles of: Carthage, Wilson's Creek,  Pea Ridge, Prairie Grove, and Westport.  I especially found interesting the  involvement of the Five Nations out of Oklahoma.  Much is covered  concerning the conflicts between Kansas and Missouri, but Texas, Arkansas  and others are treated with some detail.  Monaghan's writing style is  excellent, giving you a good feeling for what happened.  You will read and  re-read this one.	2000-07-02

Some of the areas covered are the survival of the fittest, Pseudosaurs, Punctuated Equilibrium, the eye, the egg, entropy (my  favorite), and recapitulation.  Also tackled are such subjects as  Theological Evolution, empirical science, and the fossil  &quot;evidence.&quot;  The appendices include information on Bible origins,  human cloning, and refuting abortion arguments.  Hanegraaff's writing style  is succinct and to the point, being enjoyable without boring (a must when  presenting what could be extremely dry material).  A very useful and  interesting book.	2000-07-02

While the material was well presented and Hanegraaff has a clear speaking voice, there were times that the background  score began to drown him out.  The music could have been better chosen and  more subdued.  The majority of the important text from the book is  presented however, and listeners will not be disappointed.	2000-07-02

Also included are a chapter on the Jewish weights and  measures, a list of ancient testimonies and records cited by Josephus,  texts of the Old Testament parallels to Josephus' accounts and a harmony of  the numbering systems in the Greek and English editions.  Original full  page illustrations are peppered throughout.<br />Very complete.  My only  complaint is in the print which is a type of old news print font and pretty  densly packed.<br />Overall a very good reference.	2000-07-02

Lawyers practicing in the West almost relied entirely on this and the Bible to defend or prosecute.  This particular series of volumes is  a reproduction of the original publication by Blackstone (which BTW had  eight revisions while Blackstone was still alive).  The print is large and  dark (and very 18th century, i.e. ss is S (or f)), and makes for easy  reading.  The Editor's notes appear at the beginning of the book and are  not intrusive of the volume itself.  Overall a very nice reproduction and I  found it a nice read.	2000-06-30

Simple, with all the experiental preaching going on these days my search for: &quot;what makes a  good preacher?&quot; and &quot;how do you know what good preaching  is?&quot; has led me to this book.<br />I have known about expository  preaching (and have been priveledged to have listened to preachers who  actually preach consistantly from the Word) of course, but wanted to learn  more.  The Olford's book does a fabulous job.  First and foremost they  define the role of a preacher (the Call of God, The Word, living the life  of a Godly man; being a man of God, and doing the work of God).  Secondly  they go into the preparation of the sermon (I have listened to many  preachers that sound as if they prepared their sermon the night before, and  I have had some even confess to me that that was precisely what they had  done!).  Lastly they explain delivery of the sermon (proclamation of the  Word AND Salvation).<br />This book describes that preaching the Word should  be an exciting experience (in the preparation, delivery and expectation of  change in individuals by the Lord)!  I especially like the author's  emphasis on fearless preaching (i.e. speaking on how today's happenings  compare to the Word).  Definitely no P.C. preaching here!<br />It now holds a  prominent spot on my bookshelf!  Definitely worth the purchase price.	2000-06-24

Piemonte and Jamison have compiled a list of tips and techniqes that really help.  For example: the book paid for itself  immediately by helping me overcome calling a word document directly from  Outlook (try to find a readable white paper on that one!).  <br />The only  reason that I gave it four out of five stars is that some of examples are  buggy (I went out to the web site and downloaded the code...which did work  and all was well).  The code snippets are plentiful and complete.  I have a  multitude of Outlook and Exchange books and have done several projects to  date using both Outlook 98/Outlook 2000 and Exchange Server 5.x.  This is  now seriously dog eared.  If you are doing are going to be doing Outlook  programming of any sort get a copy for your library, it is more than worth  the purchase price.	2000-06-23

This did the trick and solved several problems/issues that I had been having (all of them very complex) when dealing with VBScript in HTML (and ASP for that  matter).  The only problem I had was with the index, which could have been  more complete.<br />This book is presented as a tutorial (even written to some  degree as a tutorial), but it's usefulness is as a reference (and a pretty  advanced one I might add).

Then it dives into the good stuff: Flash interactivity (i.e. Actions/Event  handlers, Movies, ActionScript). Then the book covers interactivity with  other programs: Raster graphics, Vector Graphics, Quicktime, etc. Finally  distributing your flash movies. I gave this four stars because I found the  150 pages of &quot;Using Flash with Other Programs&quot; marginally useful.  To have been a really great book I would have liked to have seen more  JavaScript, advanced control usage (i.e. combobox, listbox, slidercontrol),  and &quot;page-to-page&quot; information transferral examples (all  intermediate to advanced concepts).  This book also makes a good overall  reference and has a decent index.	2000-06-23

Here goes:<br />This book covers the essentials in learning Flash 4 from scratch (buy the book and download the  trial version).  Very well laid out with step-by-step examples to teach you  all the basics/intermediates of Flash programming.  My only gripe was that  it didn't go into outside interactivity enough (i.e. Flash talking to  Javascript to Flash).  Now what would really be great is if the author  would come out with a more advanced book.  <br />This book also makes a great  reference with a decent index.  Well worth the purchase price.	2000-06-23

It is an excellent reference to HTML v.4.x.  Organization is the only complaint:  Instead of  truely encyclopdic it is broken into seven categories like:  General-Purpose Elements, Special Characters, Table Elements, Form  Elements, etc.  I don't even bother with this I go directly to the index  and find what I need.  Saves time (but I agree you really shouldn't have to  do this).<br />However, the examples are very good and the coverage is  excellent.  Well worth picking up a copy.  Don't let the title fool you  into thinking that you will learn HTML from it, this is a reference not a  teaching book.	2000-06-23

The step-by-step layout allows you to adapt the techniques in this book to whatever you happen to  be doing.  The only thing I could wish could be added would be some  information on managing object oriented projects (something I have had to  improvise on...lazy as that sounds!).

My only complaint is that the author does not spend enough time with things like:  creating proposals  (an example or two would have been nice), fee structures (how to set your  fee competatively), overhead calculation (only touches on this).

All topics are covered (some like &quot;Storing Information in Frames&quot; are a little choppy and hard to follow). I was  able to use several of the examples in the book to enhance websites that I  maintain, AND to move off of the unpopular VBScript allowing things to be  more browser independent (i.e. Linux)!

Essentially if you are looking for a book to walk you through learning Dreamweaver (and have it done step-by-step) this book is not for you.  This book would not work for you  very well if you are learning from the Dreamweaver download.  Instead I  suggest using the online tutorial and help (which, BTW, are  excellent).<br />Now, with the negativity aside, let me tell you what is  great:  it covers Style Sheets, Timelines, Frames (boy talk about being  nasty sometimes in DW), and Automation.  All of these are intermediate  topics and not for the shy of heart.  I liked being able to turn to an  additional reference for tips and techniques (of which these are scanty in  the DW docs).<br />Anyway, well worth the purchase price, but not a beginner's  book.	2000-06-23

A good reference on how to start your business and keep it going.  I find that I turn to this book even now when I want a reminder on how to do  something (like bid proposals) or something new (like growing my business  beyond just me).

The only place I found useful in the book concerning  this was the appendix.  Otherwise, and excellent book with outstanding  examples.

In this it solved some  problems for commercial pages I had developed that I could not (repeate  could not) find in any other book (or even the news groups).

He brings  this volume alive in a way I never imagined; making C. S. Lewis' satire  stick in your mind in a way reading the book never did for me.  A great  casting job and highly recommended!	1998-09-22

He writes from a Biblical  AND Christian viewpoint; backing his experiences well with scripture.  His  theological and practical stance do not depart from the Bible.  A  recommended followup book would be Dr. Ed Murphy's &quot;The Handbook for  Spiritual Warfare&quot;	1998-09-22
