But the subject matter is so interesting and timely that I would recommend \\"The Genius Factory\\" to most readers.  I am shocked that we live in a day and age where building a sperm bank filled with the seed of exceptional men can be considered in any way offensive.  I came away from reading this book with a deep respect for Mr. Graham, the founder: a man who actually believed women should have access to intelligent, accomplished donor sperm.  I'm not sure that the author, Mr. Plotz, a straight male with healthy offspring of his own, gave sufficient respect to the work that Mr. Graham accomplished through this project.  Maybe if he were a 41 year-old lesbian with relatively few choices, he'd have been able to write a more positive book on the subject.  I only wish the Bank were still around today...	2005-08-12

I remember sobbing over this book when I was little because I was so moved by its wonderful ending!  I recently began to hunt for it online, but couldn't remember its title and it was almost impossible to locate.  I can't believe that Harpers hasn't chosen to reissue it, and has just let it languish and drift into oblivion... <br />In my opinion, Three Little Animals represents the best of the wonderful partnership between Garth Williams and Margaret Wise Brown. A tale of little forest animals who decide to dress up and go into the city and lose each other in the anonymous crowds.  Luckily, a wind picks up and blows off their clothes and they recognize each other at once.  The look of glee and relief on their tiny furry faces made me bawl every time. <br />I hope the publishers decide to bring this one out of retirement soon.  Its story is sweetly illustrated and carries with it the crucial message of \\"don't try to be someone else; you are wonderful just as you are!\\"  Amen!	2005-06-09

This was a fairly interesting read.  Seligman spends 80% of the book discussing what he has discovered about learned optimism over the years, and what other researchers have found on the subject.  All of this information helps build an strong case for the idea that we humans can, and should, learn to be more optimistic.  <br />That being said, I gave this book such a low rating because I feel that the title is completely misleading. I didn't want to read all sorts of information about WHY changing my mind and life is important and possible.  I wanted to learn HOW, and that's what the title promises. <br />To be sure, there are some suggestions of how to learn optimism, but such little space in the book is dedicated to this topic that I felt misled and &quot;ripped off&quot; by the title.  <br />It's like reading a book called &quot;Instructions for Knitting a Sweater for your Baby&quot; and discovering that only the last chapter is in fact instructive; the first 100 pages are about the history of knitting, the need for babies to wear sweaters, what happens to those poor babies who don't wear sweaters, and why the author considers himself to be the best darn knitter in the entire county.

Other reviewers have already gone into detail on these points, so I won't belabor them.  I gave this book 2 stars because it created huge waves when released: was the subject of many magazine articles and television shows in the following months.  So, if you are like me and enjoy keeping on top of books that have helped shape the news, note that this was one of the most most talked-about books of 2002.  That being said, my other point is this: there is a business in making people scared and prophesizing doom and gloom.  Does a woman's fertility decline as she ages?  Sure.  But it varies wildly from person to person.   Do you really want to put your money towards trying to scare the wits out of high acheiving North American women, making them feel even more pressured than they already do?

She doesn't always make sound choices; she clings to her corrosive and philandering husband through thick and thin, and she overturns her Republican father's desire to create an unbiased-newspaper by making The Post a mouthpiece for the Democrats.  But it is her mistakes that make Graham most interesting and accessible to readers.  <br />Her journey is rich and varied, but not so much that it warrants more than 600 pages.

I think that there are in fact, plenty of crazy people out there, many of whom think themselves quite sane.  <br />This book has been described as the story of one woman's descent into madness.  And I cannot see it as such.  In the narrator's case, I think she clearly and unflinchingly reports the happenings of the world around her.  And her inability to accept the people and standards that her society deems 'normal' as such makes her feel extremely disconnected.<br />I had been warned when I was younger that I shouldn't read this book as it was depressing, sad, bleak, etc.  I finally devoured it for the first time last month and loved it.  YEs, the tale is sad, but I found it strangely uplifting that she had such a clear, 'modern' view of the situation in which she found herself.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-04-02

Have you ever noticed how much TRASH is peddled to girls of that age?  It's next-to-impossible to find books that feature compelling heroines, that don't condescend to the reader, and that provide &quot;oh please, Auntie, just one more chapter!&quot; plots.<br />In many so-called &quot;children's books,&quot; precocious young characters mouth off to their parents and the bemoan hardships such as not adequately filling their training bras, or having to wait for puberty to arrive.<br />Thank goodness for Anne.  She is nothing like the the protagonists of these pathetic stories.  Instead, she is spunky, imaginative and ever-resourceful.  As an orphan, she has suffered truly sad times in her young life, but never whines or sulks.  Anne is far from perfect: she talks too much, gets into lots of hilarious scrapes, and often wreaks havoc when she's trying to be helpful. But she is a joy.<br />This book which is almost a century old (first published in 1908) presents a character who much more closely resembles my neices than anything Judy Blume managed to slop together only a few decades ago.  Hooray for Anne.	2001-12-24

Since my father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, I have bought every book I could find about the subject.  After devouring each book myself, I pass it along to my mother and siblings to read.  I enjoyed &lt;Where's my Shoes&gt; because it gives a truthful and heart-felt account of one woman's situation with her father's Alzheimer's, and shows how the disease not only affects her relationship with her father but also her relationships with her siblings, husband, friends and even her clients.  Praise to Avadian for writing about her experiences.<br />That being said (typed), I did not think this was the best account that I have read of the subject.  Davidson's book &lt;Alzheimer's: A Love Story&gt; describes the author's experience with her husband's Alzheimers, and is much better written.

While not one to speak ill of the dead, I found myself sickened by the accolades accorded to the late Trudeau.  <br />In the 70s, the Canadian dollar was worth $1.07 U.S.  Today, it is worth 66 cents.  This devaluation of our dollar and the corresponding devaluation Canada, are thanks largely to Trudeau's socialist rule.  From multiculturalism to official bilingualism to the National Energy Policy, his policies demonstrated an arrogance and lack of fiscal responsibility that truly crippled Canada.<br />&lt;&lt;His Pride, Our Fall&gt;&gt; is a keenly insightful work.  Its author was not blinded by his subject's charm or sex appeal; McDonald clearly describes Trudeau's legacy and, in so doing, paints a damning picture of an egotistical and self-satisfied leader.  It serves as an effective cautionary tale for Canadian and international readers alike.	2000-10-02

I assume that most of the readers of this book will, like me, be people  who have a friend or loved one suffering from Alzheimers.  I bought  &quot;Alzheimers, A Love Story&quot; looking for some concrete answers and  suggestions, but instead found a lovely, highly personal story of one  woman's struggle with her husband's early years with the disease.  Although  I was at first disappointed, since I didn't find much information about the  hows and whys, I am now very pleased that I discovered this book.	2000-08-28

As a former English major and flunker-of-high-school  science classes, educating myself about the disease was a daunting task.   &quot;One Renegade Cell&quot; explains in intelligent but clear language  the theories that currently best explain how the disease begins and  spreads.  <br />In my search for knowledge, I have found many books that  explain cancer as though to the Village Idiot.  And I have found others  that explain it as though to a PhD in Biology.  I am truly thankful that  Weinberg wrote this rare book that can be enjoyed and understood by the  rest of us.	2000-08-26

I've just finished  reading some juicy little numbers about Truman Copote and Nancy  Reagan...MEOW!  <br />But &quot;Dark Place&quot; is neither compelling nor  believable.  It describes the researcher Birute Galdikas, who has spent  years following orangutans in the jungle and is now considered the foremost  researcher on these delightful hairy beasts.  I was hoping for some really  salacious details, but this book was more or less a yawn.  I hear that  Birute is now in the process of suing the author and has dozens of  witnesses to discredit Spalding.  <br />So do yourself a favor.  If you want a  great book about Orangutans and the research about them, buy   &quot;Reflections of Eden.&quot;  If you want some well-written,  brilliantly-researched cattiness, read &quot;The Women of Camelot.&quot;   But if you're looking for a combination of the two, well, the story has yet  to be written.	2000-08-19

I bought this book a week ago and so I'm afraid I cannot (yet) echo the glowing testimonials of some of the other reviewers who could claim that  &quot;Taking Charge...&quot; helped them to conceive after years of failed  attempts.  However, I do feel qualified to deem it well-written and  extremely informative.  <br />Like another Canadian reviewer, I too was taught  much of this fertility information while in junior high school.  However,  since I did not become sexually active until the age of...well... many  years later, I had forgotten much of it by the time I needed to use it in  my own life.  <br />But I suspect that even people who have been taught this  information in the past and managed to retain some of it would do well to  buy a copy of &quot;Taking Charge&quot; just to have as a reference book  (you know... Rogets Thesaurus, Oxford Concise, Chamber's Etymology right  next to &quot;Taking Charge of your Fertility...&quot;)  Seriously, most of  us women are sadly out of touch with how our bodies really function and how  to work WITH our reproductive systems rather than AGAINST them in order to  avoid or achieve pregnancy.<br />I am no hippy chick.  I was on the pill for  more than a decade, and have quite happily submitted my body to all sorts  of unnatural activities, substances, chemicals, etc.  But even a modern  girl like me will really benefit from curling up in bed with a copy of this  tome.	2000-08-19

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is a personality test based on Jungian theory.  In a nutshell, it states that every person falls into one of  sixteen categories, and each one of these categories or &quot;Types&quot;  has distinct needs, ways of interacting with others, manners of processing  information, etc.  <br />&quot;Do What You Are&quot; attempts to help  individuals plot their own careers based on their own Myers Briggs  &quot;Type.&quot;  Before finding this book, the only other career-related  thing I had read was &quot;What Colour is your Parachute,&quot; which was  terrific.  But I loved &quot;Do What you Are&quot; because it stated  something that is so rarely said today... that you should find a job and  career that suits who you really are.  I passed this book around to all my  friends and family, and most (but not all) loved it, too.<br />Something I  found particularly delightful was that it affirmed a lot of things I had  been thinkingabout my own situation, but had considered  &quot;unimportant.&quot;  My type is &quot;ENFP&quot; (I know it might  sound like jibberish to you now, but it will make sense if you read the  book).  This is a type that thrives on creativity, feels confined by rigid  rules, and needs lots of friendly social interaction on the job.  But,  since I have a high IQ and did well at school, others have constantly tried  to push me into &quot;status&quot; fields like medecine and litigation.  In  my heart, I had always felt those kinds of careers would kill me, but I  couldn't really articulate why.  After reading &quot;Do What you Are,&quot;   I was better able to accept my instincts and explored PR, fundraising, and  finally settled on a job in publishing.  I LOVE my job, and although I  think I would have arrived here eventually, I do think that it would have  taken me twice as long to arrive had I not read this book.	2000-08-18

People who inherit money should just shut up and be thankful.  But the author of the &quot;Golden Ghetto&quot;  acknowledges what almost no other American is brave or smart enought to  admit: inheriting a fortune often brings with it some negative  side-effects.  <br />O'Neill brings to light the fact that money can isolate  people, especially children, from their peers; can magnify problems that  already exist within a family; can provide the means to keep problems of  addiction &quot;hush hush&quot; and therefore lessen the likelihood of  treatment.  She does not diminish the fact that wealth brings priviledge  and power, but demonstrates that happiness is not as inextricably linked to  money as our culture would wish us to believe.	2000-08-06
