Overblown promotions of drugs and concealment of drug side-effects well explained. Big Pharma's use of public relations firms to create fear of some more or less normal condition is shown. Big Pharma's capture of the FDA and other agencies is shown. <br /> <br />Big Pharma's secret ownership of some patient support groups is shown, as is its control of much Continuing Medical Education. Its lobbying is legendary. <br /> <br />Even if you know about this disgrace in the USA, there are many aspects that may be new to you, so read this book. <br /> Easy to read, good referencing, decent index. <br /> <br /> Weak technically, but this might have been a desire not to stress the reader. Still, authors seem unaware that older people with the highest cholesterol and LDL levels live the longest (Schupf N, Costa R, Luchsinger J, et al. (2005). Relationship Between Plasma Lipids and All-Cause Mortality in Nondemented Elderly. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 53:219-226.), or that blood pressure rises naturally with age, and only the top 10% of BP levels can be treated with any benefit.	2005-10-02

Based on the author's experience as a detail man, the heroine, a detail woman, finally realizes how much damage she does in overpromoting a fictional drug that turns out to be harmful in some cases (think Vioxx). The influence of Big Pharma on prescribing habits is well presented, and those habits have little to do with good medical science or cost, except maybe to keep the cost high.	2005-07-19

It was fascinating to read about the personal characters of many of the main players with aspirin.     For the primary prevention of heart attacks, the author failed to note that most or all of the subjects were men in the various trials. Based on later work available to Mr. Jeffreys, this omission was serious, since MDs and others recommended aspirin for women as though they had been tested from the beginning.     The Physicians Health Study (PHS) of 7 years duration that generated all the rave headlines (p262) in 1989 did cut mostly non-fatal heart attack risk to 0.31 of placebo. Mr. Jeffreys failed to mention that the all-cause death risk was 0.96 and not statistically significant. Further, he neglected to mention that the PHS did not use aspirin, but used Bufferin. This is not a trivial difference because of the beneficial magnesium content of Bufferin. The later UK trial of plain aspirin on 5,500 male physicians for 7 years told a different story. The risk of non-fatal heart attack was a less impressive 0.68, and the mortality risk was 1.06. A later trial of 3.1 years that included separate results for women taking daily aspirin of unknown form gave them a mortality risk of 1.12.     Mr. Jeffreys fell for the ruse of relative risk (RR) rather than absolute risk (AR); Big Pharma uses RR to generate bigger numbers. For the 22,000 men in the PHS the reduction of AR per year of a first heart attack was just 0.11%, not a big deal. Aspirin for primary prevention is not worth the risk.     For secondary prevention of heart attacks (ones other than the first), Mr. Jeffreys correctly presented the fact that the RR with aspirin was down to 0.75-0.80; but he failed to note that just 5 weeks of daily aspirin provided nearly all of the \\"benefit\\"; so it was never necessary to continue aspirin forever and suffer all the side-effects mentioned but minimized by Mr. Jeffreys. Aspirin is probably worth the risk for short-term use in secondary prevention. He did note that women were under-represented in these early trials, but did not come to the obvious conclusion that women should avoid aspirin. He failed to note that long-term use of aspirin was associated with cataracts. He failed to compare the minor effects of aspirin with those of valuable supplements, such as EPA/DHA from fish oil, magnesium, and even vitamin E.     In enthusing about aspirin as an anticancer drug, Mr. Jeffreys failed to note that the increased mortality rates noted above, which include cancer deaths, make it unlikely that aspirin will ever be a serious threat to cancer.     Mr. Jeffreys repeated the nonsense that fatty foods cause atherosclerosis leading to heart attacks (p235, 267), and presented the challenge to this dogma in a footnote that mentioned Uffe Ravnskov as a \\"lone wolf\\" dissenter. This is a propagandist trick as there have been many, many dissenters over the years to what is called the \\"diet-heart\\" theory. See [...] (What is true is that polyunsaturated fats or oils, especially ones made from the omega-6 linoleic acid and trans fatty acids from partial hydrogenation do cause both diabetes and atherosclerosis, not animal or tropical fats.)   *****   Minor problems were confusing heart attacks (myocardial infarctions) caused by broken pieces of plaque or congealed blood platelets (thrombi) with congestive heart failure, and by ignoring sudden cardiac death brought on by arrhythmias.     Beta-blocker drugs do not steady the heartbeat (p246) as antiarrythmics were supposed to do, but slow the heartbeat.     Salicylates are not alkaloids (p11).     Aniline is not isolated from coal tar (p42).     Acid anhydrides are not usually obtained when acids are separated from water (p46).     Aspirin is not metabolized by loss of the hydroxyl group (p47).     A paradox? \\"Aspirin didn't cure a single case of influenza, but it helped millions of people in their battle withthe virus and undoubtedly saved many lives as a result.\\" (p124)     Reverse snobbery? Some chemical names of 25 letters or fewer were fussed over. Would Mr. Jeffreys have done the same for the 28-letter name Abercrombie Featherstonehaugh? (p207, 214ff)     Aspirin was buffered in an attempt to ease stomach distress, not to speed up absorption (p210).     The great superiority of magnesium to aspirin in pre-eclampsia was ignored (p266).     The \\"polypill\\" containing aspirin, beta-blocker and statin drugs was presented as a great idea (p273). Those who understand more than Mr. Jeffreys have written that it is ridiculous. See [...]    [...]	2005-03-28

Atkins followers know that the early weight loss on an extremely low-carb diet is mostly water loss. \\"You'll eat three balanced meals a day...\\" is a complete misrepresentation of the ultra low-carb Phase-One. Not that \\"balanced meals\\" - roughly equal calorie amounts of carb, fat and protein - were a good idea for many people anyway. <br /> <br /> The strengths of this book are the admission that the low-fat diet of the American Heart Association and many other NGOs does not work (p8); that there are good and bad forms of LDL cholesterol (p33); that fruit juice with no fiber is worse for you than whole fruit (p46); that more cooking raises the glycemic index (GI) of many vegetables (p53); that fiber consumption will slow digestion of carbs, which is good (p64); and that the bread basket served in restaurants is a diet disaster because of the high GI carb content of the breads (p86). While he understands the value of low GI foods, he is blank on glycemic load, the amount of high GI carbs in a food. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses are: Dr. Agatston claims not to have found literature support for a medium carb diet in the literature in the mid-1990s, showing an appalling inability to read the literature, including books by Richard K. Bernstein, MD, Barry Sears, PhD, John Yudkin, MD, and many others. He parrots the nonsense that high cholesterol is a major factor in heart disease (p7, p96) despite evidence from 1937 that it is not, nor is high LDL. See Uffe Ravnskov, MD, PhD, \\"The Cholesterol Myths\\", 2000. He misrepresents the Atkins Diet as low-fat (p10), and misrepresents most fruits, vegetables and whole grains as containing \\"good carbs\\" (p10 and many others places)despite the long-known fact that starches that turn to glucose and the fructose from fruits are not beneficial in large amounts. He claims that low-fat dairy products are not fattening (p11) despite their content of high-GI lactose without enough fat to slow its absorption. See Mary G. Enig, \\"Know Your Fats\\", 1999. He recommends polyunsaturated oils, especially the omega-6 ones (p22), which are definitely not healthful, and worsen heart disease. He slams saturated fats with no evidence whatever on their safety. In fact, a recent study showed that high saturated fat consumption reversed coronary artery blockage, while monounsaturated fat (olive oil) narrowed arteries slightly, and polyunsaturated fats (soybean oil) narrowed arteries seriously (Mozaffarian D et al., Am J Clin Nutr 2004;80:1175-84). He recommends balsamic vinegar (p29) despite its high sugar content. He claims that \\"carbs are good for you\\" despite evidence that there is no nutritional requirement for them at all in humans (Fred & Alice Ottoboni, PhDs, The Modern Nutritional Diseases, 2002). In dumping on beer (p50, p88), he is unaware of low-carb versions. He thinks apple skin has special benefits; there is no evidence given for this, and not eating it spares you all the pesticide content (p55). In pushing red wines (p56), he ignores the high sugar content of most of them, and is unaware that wine does little to reduce all-cause mortality. He does not emphasize that eating fat will slow digestion of carb much better than fiber (p64). His GI table (pp70-74) leaves out all the foods with low GI, such as meat, fish, fat, oil and nuts. He confuses the sugar content in beets with the lack of it in MSG made from beets (p88). He failed to warn of the dangers of extreme exercise (p92); see Henry Solomon, \\"The Exercise Myth\\", 1984. He fails to warn of dairy, grain and wheat allergies, and the relationship of these foods to arthritis and cancer (p92). He recommends a form of carb-loading before exercise (p93),contrary to the findings of Barry Sears, PhD (Enter the Zone, by Barry Sears, PhD, and Bill Lawren.  New York, NY:Regan/HarperCollins1995). <br /> <br /> He lauds both statin drugs and aspirin despite their bad effect on women of higher mortality and their lack of benefit in men (Duane Graveline, MD, MPH, \\"Lipitor Thief of Memory\\", 2004). He neglects beneficial effects of vitamin C other than on heart attacks (p94). He mistakes the d-alpha-tocopherol as \\"the natural form of  vitamin E\\" despite clear research findings that vitamin E is a mixture of 8 compounds (p95). Despite his specialty of medical imaging, he fails to comprehend the findings that the extent of calcified plaque deposits in coronary arteries as found by electron beam tomography has no correlation whatever to serum cholesterol levels (Hecht HS et al., Am J Cardiol 2004;93:101-3). <br /> <br /> Most evidence was testimonials, not controlled trials. There were no citations to peer-reviwed journals. <br /> <br /> The South Beach Diet is not so great - Bill Clinton used it for years. Some of the most healthful fats are disparaged, and carbs of no value are touted. Grain and dairy allergies are almost ignored. The many recipes given in the book  are flawed for this reason.

Here is a fearless quotation describing some of the advice you may have believed: <br /> <br /> \\"So desperate is the anti-sun lobby to convince you of the dangers of the sun so that you will buy its products year-round, the representatives will tell you with a straight face that if it's February in Boston and you're planning to walk to the corner store to buy a quart of milk or sit outside on your lunch break, you should wear [smear on] sunscreen. This is wrong-headed and alarmist. Even on the sunniest February day, the sun isn't strong enough in New England or New York to increase your risk of skin cancer significantly... The scare tactics of the cosme-ceutical industry have been embraced by most of the dermatology profession. These groups have worked in concert and frightened the daylights out of people - or, to put it more accurately, frightened people out of the daylight.\\" (pp12-13) <br /> <br /> Evidence is given from Dr. Holick's own work and others that vitamin D levels are too low in a large fraction of the world's humans, especially those with dark skin and living more than 30° from the equator. This deficiency causes more osteoporosis, rickets, high blood pressure, stroke, heart attacks, arthritis, multiple sclerosis and cancer than had been believed just 20 years ago. The types of skin cancer caused by excessive sunlight are easily treated and are rarely fatal. <br /> <br /> With the greatest care, Dr. Holick explains how to obtain the UVB rays from the sun (or tanning parlor lights) without receiving too much UVA or becoming burned. He does advocate the use of sunscreens, the ones that absorb UVA as well as UVB, after you have had all the sun exposure that is safe. For the very pale-skinned or for arctic dwellers, supplements are advocated. <br /> <br /> This easy-to-read book, backed by 120 citations to papers in peer-reviewed journals (unfortunately not numbered), has an index and a glossary. Dr. Holick is no outsider, having published over 200 peer-reviewed papers, and with a lifetime of research in dermatology and endocrinology. <br /> <br /> Not all is perfect. The little diet advice is misinformed (p55) , pretty much the low-fat low-cholesterol nonsense that has been discredited for years ([...] The Atkins diet is hardly a fad with 60,000,000 people using some form of it in the USA alone [Joel M. Kauffman, Low-Carbohydrate Diets, J. Scientific Exploration , 18(1), 83-134 (2004)]. In fact, vitamin D is made by the action of UVB on cholesterol in the skin! A large number of clinical studies showed that total cholesterol levels &lt;180 were associated with depression, accidents, suicide, homicide, antisocial personality disorder in criminals and Army veterans, cocaine and heroin addiction, and high relapse rates after detoxification (Buydens-Branchey, L., Branchey, M. Association Betwee Low Plasma Levels of Cholesterol and Relapse in Cocaine Addicts. Psychosomatic Medicine,  2003;65:86-91). One wonders whether some of the effects of low cholesterol levels, especially increased cancer rates, are due to vitamin D deficiency. <br /> <br /> Some very fine data from two studies was given on the use of vitamin D supplements to prevent bone fractures (pp85-86). One study used 800 IU of vitamin D daily and the other 760 IU daily in the elderly. Both cut the bone fracture rate in half in both men and women. These studies are not cross-referenced under the Section on vitamin D supplements (pp151-153), or found in the index under vitamin D supplements. <br /> <br /> We are warned not to overdose on vitamin A from multivitamin capsules in order to obtain the vitamin D in them and we are warned about vitamin D toxicity,yet Dr. Holick wrote that people over 1 year old could take up to 2000 IU of vitamin D supplements daily without medical supervision. The superiority of sunlight for vitamin D production is reinforced (pp151-153). <br /> <br /> Despite the caveats, this is an excellent book. <br />	2005-02-10

The five chapters go over the bacterial presence and their wars for supremacy in our intestines, an explanation of digestion, the conditions for which probiotics are most beneficial, which ones to choose, and how to take them.     However, even for its small size, this book is too simplistic. Only two types of probiotic strains are covered, really: Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. What is always needed in a book on medical or nutritional treatments is a discussion of controlled trials, or at least observational studies to back up the claims made for the treatment. While some trial results are given, details are too few. Many claims are made for probiotic treatment without any solid trial results being given. Using probiotics to counteract the side effects of antibiotics, for traveler's diarrhea, and for candidiasis were the most persuasive advice. Too much of the support was from individual testimonials.  [...]          Unfortunately, a number of myths of mainstream medicine are repeated. The claims for the benefits for fiber are not substantiated, and some ethnic groups do well eating none at all. The advice to drink 8 8-oz glasses of water per day has no trial evidence whatever (Ottoboni, 2002). The advice to \\"...eat a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables...\\" (p19) is absurd, since such a diet would lack key amino acids from meat and essential fats (Ottoboni, 2002).     Weber emphasized cholesterol (LDL) control (p33ff) by means of low-fat diet and the use of probiotics. After writing that cholesterol is a biological necessity, he wrote that LDL, which delivers it to all cells, is bad. This is absurd. The fact is that a meta-analysis of 24 diet trials on low-fat low-cholesterol diets showed that there was no significanteffect of these diets on either coronary artery disease or total mortality (Garber, 1996; Ravnskov 1998). Kowtowing to the mainstream medicine obsession with cholesterol and saturated fat has opposite of what is claimed for it. Women and men over 60 with the highest cholesterol levels live the longest. If probiotics have antiinflammatory and anticancer efbeen shown to be a mistake based on a fraud from the beginning [...]. The Framingham study showed the fects as claimed, then a reduction in protective cholesterol (LDL) levels will follow as a result.     Weber's recommended brand of probiotics is based on the viability of bacteria prepared in a special way to survive at room temperature and become active when swallowed. While this is OK, he gives no evidence that well-made probiotics that need refrigeration are a poor choice if they are refrigerated and have an expiration date with the number of active bacteria per mL up to that date. An error on this topic (p33) was that 10exp8 bacteria were said to be 1/2 billion instead of 5x10exp8. Giving under Resources (p57) the URL for only 1 brand (Wakunaga) is not misleading. While Weber is not an owner of this company, he has done some analytical work for it.     [...] while there is some good advice on probiotics in this book, watch out for the rest.  [...]	2005-01-23
US	49326459	R49G9T1V9JP5K	0195176847	94088233	On the Take: How Medicine's Complicity with Big Business Can Endanger Your Health	Books	5	64	69	N	N	Big Pharma Out of Control	Fact-dense, well referenced, yet balanced in tone and easy to read, this book is the best expos I have ever read on the financial conflicts of the medical profession caused by the efforts of Big Pharma, which for this review will include device and test manufacturers as well as drug makers. From pens and pads to cruises and fake consulting arrangements, Big Pharma has caused financial conflicts in many physicians and others \\"on the take\\". Many of the consulting deals are to give talks, ostensibly based on good medical science, that promote a product. Much of this is shown to occur at Continuing Medical Education courses sponsored by Big Pharma in which gifts are freely dispensed, reprints of journal articles favorable to products are handed out, and financial ties of the \\"consultants\\" giving talks are minimized or concealed. <br /> <br /> Academic researchers are tainted as well. By being encouraged by their universities to obtain grants with overhead from Big Pharma, they must do research that helps in product development. Agreements may delay, prevent or pollute the publication of results. When a product possibility from a government (usually NIH) grant is seen, federal legislation passed 20 years ago allows the researcher to patent discoveries, form a company, and do clinical trials on his own potential product. While this may have led to valuable results, the potential for bias at every step due to financial conflict is clearly laid out. <br /> <br /> Journals fare little better, even the prominent JAMA, NEJM and Annals of Internal Medicine. Papers that may have been ghost-written by Big Pharma on clinical trials with selectively favorable results are published [see Joel M. Kauffman, Bias in Recent Papers on Diets and Drugs in Peer-Reviewed Medical Journals, J. Am. Physicians & Surgeons,  9(1), 11-14 (2004)]. Editors and peer-reviewers may have ties to Big Pharma. Editorials and comments in medical journals may be written by authors with financial conflicts of interest. Revealing such conflicts is mostly on the honor system at present. <br /> <br /> Clinical guidelines for physicians are promulgated by committees whose members often have close ties to Big Pharma. The products included in formularies of HMOs, Medicare and other insurers, the only products that will be paid for, are influenced by Big Pharma, whose general lobbying efforts are already legendary. <br /> <br /> Dr. Kassirer gives many specific examples of financial conflicts. Far from quitting with the devastating description of how bad things are, he goes on to make specific suggestions for reform, while being very realistic about their success without federal action for certain conflicts. He lists many desirable changes, such as no gifts from Big Pharma at all, boycotting meetings sponsored by Big Pharma, disclosure mandated for all financial ties, and selection of journal editors, officers of medical societies and leaders of medical schools who have no financial conflicts. He did not seem to indicate the degree of influence of Big Pharma on the FDA. <br /> <br /> Trying not to alienate most of the medical profession, Dr. Kassirer wrote that most MDs are basically ethical and went into the profession for non-financial as well as financial reasons. Reductions in income with increased work loads due to inadequate compensation from HMOs and Medicare is one of the reasons so many MDs have looked outside normal practice for income. <br /> ****** <br /> He dropped a few hints that most major classes of drugs are more beneficial than they actually are [see Joel M. Kauffman, \\"Drugging Cardiovascular Disease\\", J. Am. Physicians & Surgeons,  9(4), 98-99 (2004)], and that alternative practices are not worth much [see Joel M. Kauffman, \\"Alternative Medicine: Watching the Watchdogs at Quackwatch\\", Website Review, J. Scientific Exploration 16(2), 312-337 (2002)]. <br /> This is a very minor blemish on one of the great exposs of all time, the \\"Unsafe at Any Speed\\" of the medical madness in the USA today. <br /> ****** <br /> Daniel Haley's \\"Politics in Healing\\" describes the squashing of alternatives. <br /> Charles T. McGee's \\"Heart Frauds\\" exposes the mythology behind so much medical advice. <br /> H. Gilbert Welch's \\"Should I Be Tested for Cancer?\\" gives the evidence for the harm in excessive testing. <br /> John Anderson's \\"Overdosed America\\" reveals the extent of perverted clinical drug trials. <br /> Merrill Goozner's \\"The $800 Million Pill\\" give the lie to Big Pharma's claim that high prices are needed for the discovery of breakthrough drugs, as does... <br /> Marcia Angell's \\"The Truth About the Drug Companies\\", which also suggests how the perversion of drug trials can be halted.	2005-01-19

The realities of choosing experiments were fairly presented, which is that the scientist(s) involved thought in advance that a certain relationship existed, then designed an experiment to verify. Good scientists admit it when the experiment does not confirm their notions. None of the idealized \\"hypothesis, experiment, theory, experiment, law\\" that we were taught in school. The judgment of the scientists on what data points to accept or reject, and their close relation with the apparatus was seen as most important. The importance of peer-review and replication was down-played. <br /> <br /> The experiments were chosen by polling the authors contacts, and are Eratosthenes' measurement of the earth's circumference, Galileo's work on gravity by dropping things and by using inclined planes, Newton's analysis of colors by using two prisms on sunlight, Cavendish's determination of the mass of the earth, Young's double slit experiment showing the wave nature of light, Foucault's pendulum demonstrating the rotation of the earth, Millikan's oil-drop experiment to determine the charge of the electron, Rutherford's gold foil bombardment that showed the structure of the atom, and a team's experiment that showed the wave nature of single electrons. <br /> <br /> All good choices, but the lack of Chemistry and Biology experiments is the biggest fault of the choices. <br /> <br /> Crease visited a number of the sites where the experiments were done. The book also has a large number of endnotes to sources. The placement of the experiments in the context of their times was well done. Personalities of the scientsts were discussed. The public's reactions to the experiments was given. What makes an experiment beautiful and comparisons of art and science were well done. No other recent book of this type was found on searchingwww.Amazon.com. <br /> <br /> My only complaints are that some of the diagrams that would have made comprehension easier were not presented. More was needed on Galileo's inclined planes to show F = M.a better; it was hard to see how Cavendish's experiment worked; and  Rutherford's experiment sorely needed a picture of atoms in foil deflecting alpha rays as in any Chemistry text. Maybe to be done for a second printing, as this book should deserve.	2004-12-28

There is a large section on specific treatment of many conditions, from antibiotic side-effects, to yeast infections, to Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, radiation damage, and many others for which probiotics may be the best or only effective treatment.<br /><br /> The usual \\"prescription\\" is to take by mouth gelatin capsules or powder stirred into water containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium bifidum of particular strains found most effective. While the author's company, Natren, is barely mentioned in the book, the instructions on how to select the best commercial probiotic products point to the Natren products, which are also considered by others to be among the best.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, most diet advice, while common, is at odds with actual scientific findings. Trenev's recommendations are to eat a diet that provides 60% of its energy from complex carbohydrates (p31). Avoiding animal products is encouraged repeatedly backed up only by unsupported rationale on \\"putrefaction\\" of such foods in our digestive systems. The fact is that a meta-analysis of 24 diet trials on low-fat low-cholesterol diets showed that here was no significant effect of these diets on either coronary artery disease or total mortality (Garber, 1996; Ravnskov 1998).<br /><br /> Recommending low-fat diets to diabetics (p169) is especially destructive, since fats do not raise blood sugar or insulin levels at all (Bernstein, 2003).<br /><br /> The recommendation for breast milk was good.<br /><br /> Stating that there is no known cause for Crohn's disease (p163) ignores a great deal of evidence that this, celiac disease, colitis and other conditions are caused by food allergies, especially to the proteins in the whole grains that Trenev recommends so strongly (Eades, 2000; Braly, 2002; Smith, 2002). People should be tested for these allergies and avoid the offending foods, using probiotics only if this fails.<br /><br /> One does not have to drink milk or yogurt to get enough calcium (p42); it is present in cheeses, sardines, and some in all vegetables and nuts. Trenev promotes dairy products their vitamin B12 content, avoiding the fact that meat, fish and eggs are the best sources (McCully, 2000).<br /><br /> A number of other errors do no credit to this author: 60,000-100,000 pounds is not 30,000-50,000 tons (p27).

US	49326459	R2NA7E4J3BZ2H4	0375414835	61350955	Powerful Medicines: The Benefits, Risks, and Costs of Prescription Drugs	Books	3	76	92	N	N	Erudite, authoritative, courageous, honest, and flawed	Easy to read and follow, wide-ranging in scope, dripping with insight from a real medical insider, and very humorous besides, this book is a tour-de-force in many aspects. Problems with HMOs, the FDA, Big Pharma, and out-of-control drug advertising are all addressed.   The benefits of drugs are  addressed by giving examples of the launching of some that were later risky enough to be banned. The most detailed illustration of the benefits and limitations of the randomized clinical trial (RCT) I have ever read are in this book. Dr. Avorn also gave the best illustration of the advantages of the observational study on large numbers of subjects as a better way to find the risks of drugs.   The risks of drugs have many causes besides thier inherent toxicity. Dr. Avorn shows how the subjects in an RCT may be healthier or younger or too male compared with the likely drug target group, how dosages may be too high for children or the elderly, how adverse effects are hard to predict and under-reported and that RCTs are not run for enough time. He notes how too many drugs are approved by the FDA based on handy measurements such as blood pressure or cholesterol levels, not real clinical endpoints, like death.   The costs of drugs are noted to be whatever the markets will bear, even when the key discoveries are made in government or academic labs, as is usually the case.   He writes about the drug information overload for physicians from ads or \\"detail women\\" from Big Pharma, and of \\"education\\" courses put on by Big Pharma, all biased of course.   Dr. Avorn has, for &#62;25 years, been involved in studies on how to use computerized data on filled prescriptions and later medical histories of each patient to correlate drug use with well-being. Some of the results have been put into practice with improved patient well-being and lower costs for drugs. He also introduced \\"academic detailing\\" to teach physicians how to prescribe better and cheaper drugs. For these efforts alone he should have a Nobel Prize in Medicine, in my opinion.   He makes a number of practical suggestions on improving health care in the USA, all with understanding that pluralism, competition and choice are key features of any success in the USA. Prescribing via computer could alert the MD to cheaper drug alternatives, dosage for each age group, and potential interactions. The pharmacy would have accurate input and alerts to prescriptions being filled at other pharmacies. Of larger scope is Dr. Avorn's idea of creating non-profit health-care provider organizations that are also the insurers. They would be audited annually and evaluated for effectiveness annually with all results being made public.  Other suggestions are that drug approval by the FDA no longer be \\"yes and good luck\\" or \\"no\\", but that there be conditional approvals to be reviewed. Some other federal agency would evaluate risks, not the same people in the FDA who approved the drugs.    There is great detail and subtlety overall. The index is adequate. Referencing by page number was sparse. *****  So how could I give only 3 stars to this tour-de-force? While Dr. Avorn was realistic about drug classes such as the NSAIDS (Vioxx, Celebrex), he is far too sanguine, in my opinion, about anticancer, blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol drugs. He is far too negative about vitamins and supplements.   Anticancer drugs usually do not prolong life (Moss, 2000).   There is no evidence that the wide use of BP drugs provides major benefits, even Dr. Avorn's preferred beta-blockers and diuretics. In RCTs combined in a meta-analysis, the use of beta-blockers reduced mortality by only 0.1% annually (Psaty, 1997). The ALLHAT RCT cited by Dr. Avorn had no placebo arm, and the results for the diuretic, which was not a thiazide type, were a bit worse than for the other drug types (Kauffman, 2004). Only when BP is very high, as in the Swedish Trial in Old Patients (STOP), (Dahlf, 1991), is the result barely worthwhile.  The 1627 subjects of both sexes were 70-84 years old and had mean BP = 195/102 at baseline and were followed for 4 years at 116 health centers in Sweden. The drugs were a diuretic, or the same combined with a beta-blocker. After 4 years 89% of the drug-treated group were alive vs. 85% on placebo, for a drop of just 1% per year in mortality. Stroke rate dropped just 1.5% per year.   In the ASCOT trial of atorvastatin (Lipitor), the chance of not dying was improved by just 0.15% per year (Sever, 2003) at a cost of $1,000,000 to prevent 1 death for one year! And this was a trial that Pfizer chose to publish! In the few RCTs in which mortality for women on statin drugs was published, it was higher in all cases (Criqui, 2004), as it is also for aspirin use (Kauffman, 2002). The slight benefits of statin drugs on heart attack and mortality rates have nothing to do with lowering cholesterol or LDL levels, but are related to the presence of cytomegalovirus or inflammation in mostly male patients with severely blocked coronary arteries (Horne, 2003).   Dr. Avorn does not admit that the low compliance rates with these two types of drugs is caused by their severe side-effects such that half drop them in a year and up to 3/4  after 2 years (Pahor, 2000; Jackevicius, 2002).   Dr. Avorn was extremely negative on the use of supplements, and on the 1994 law that declared them foods, not drugs, unaware of the previous FDA bias in evaluating them. He wrote that none have had valid trial results. This is untrue for selenium (Bjelakovic et al., 2004), a few herbals (Vickers, 1999), ginkgo (Kleijnen, 1992), vitamin C (Hickey, 2004), magnesium (Paolissi, 1989) and some others.   Stopping useless drugs altogether rather than substituting cheaper ones, and using certain supplements will save far more than prescribing generics!

A masterful work on the exaggerations by Big Pharma on the cost of developing new prescription drugs. Tells detailed stories of the development of erythropoietin (Epo), Ceredase, Replagal, AZT and triple cocktail for AIDS, Cisplatin, Taxol, Erbitux, sulfanilamide, Tagamet, Zantac, Prilosec, Nexium and others. The stories are easy to understand and back up Goozner's contention that most real breakthroughs in drug development are the result of long years of work by academics or in government labs (NIH), and occcasionally by biotech firms, usually not by the Big Pharma companies. <br /> <br />  Goozner confirms others in noting that about 4/5ths of \\"new\\" drugs, while being new molecules, are similar to others on the market. This consumes most of Big Pharma's research and sales dollars. He shows that simply purifying a drug to sell one of two isomers (left-handed, say, not mixed left- and right-handed) will get a new drug approval from the FDA (Nexium vs. Prilosec, I think). Sometimes this is valuable for patients, but not always. In ibuprofen it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Goozner carefully works out the cost of a typical new drug launch at $100 to $200 million, a lot, but not $800. Many details are explained, such as orphan drugs, and access for compassionate use. Some of the perversions of drug trials are exposed, such as failure to compare a new drug with the best previous one. The limitations of newer NSAIDS (Celebrex, Vioxx) and many anticancer drugs are brought out. <br /> <br /> This book has good good academic referencing and a good index. So why only 4 stars? The layout, some of the chemistry and some of the pharmacology. <br /> <br /> Each paragraph is a gem of understandable prose. From p229: \\"As the twenty-first century dawned, the drug industry's search for new drugs to replace old ones coming off patent became frenzied. There were fifty-two drugs with more than $1 billion in sales in 2000, but forty-two were slated to lose their patent protection by 2007. The drugs that account for fully half the industry's sales were on the cusp of low-cost, generic competition. But instead of looking for truly innovative medicines, which are dependent on the maturation of biological understanding and even then are difficult to find, an increasing share of the industry's research and development budgets turned to the search replacement [\\"me-too\\"] drugs...\\"  However, I found it hard to read this book for more than 20-40 mintues at a time. There are no tables, graphs, photos, section headings or sub-section headings; it is one continuous mass of text except for chapter headings, most of which are cute, but do not explain what is on the chapter. <br />Occasionally people are mentioned with no context (Kessler, p145). <br /> <br /> Chemically, the most serious error was confusing positional isomers on a benzene ring with left- and right-handed forms of a drug, which depend on the positions of 4 different substituents on a carbon atom (p221). These are called \\"optical isomers\\". Only exact mirror image compounds are called enantiomers. <br /> <br /> Pharmacologically, Goozner was not aware of the misleading effects of lead time bias (earlier detection on 5-year survival rates in cancer. He overstated the benefits and understated the risks of cisplatin and Taxol, not looking for all-cause death rates. Conversely, he took at face value the claims for anticholesterol and blood pressure drugs, which have very few benefits long-term. He missed that the ALLHAT trial of blood pressure drugs had no placebo (p248), so based on earlier trials that did, no standard drug treatment for moderately high blood pressures is worthwhile. See: Joel M. Kauffman, Bias in Recent Papers on Diets and Drugs in Peer-Reviewed Medical Journals, J. Am. Physicians & Surgeons,  9(1), 11-14 (2004). <br /> <br /> Still, this book is a valuable reference to have.	2004-11-02

Easy to read, exhaustively referenced (but without numbered references), Martin's dry humor is sparse at the beginning, but expands nicely as the book progresses. There are no picures, tables or graphs. For my taste, too many myths, legends, personal anecdotes, and non-scientific thoughts including poetic fantasies detracted from the many experimental findings that were presented. <br /> <br /> Every aspect of sleep was addressed: REM, NREM, deep-wave, insomnia, too little sleep with many warnings about its effect on driving and other activities, alcohol and sleep, falling asleep, snoring, apnea, dreaming, waking up, SIDS...everything! Some conclusions were not surprising - many people in industrialized countries are suffering from too litttle sleep or too little deep sleep, and wake up to alarm clocks, a stress. Many school children sleep through classes because of poor regular sleep. <br /> <br /> Martin demonstrated a few lapses in content. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome was said to have complex causes, including \\"malfunctioning immune reactions\\" (p21). Actually, it is proven that food allergies, especially grain allergies, are a common cause of CFS. People who get sleepy 90 minutes after eating a meal (p157) was not connected with hypogycemia from high-carbohydrate food. ADHD may well be caused by poor sleeping (p232), but no mention of its possible connection with diet was made (J. Am. Phys. Surg. 2003;8(2):58-60). Serum cholesterol levels were said to be a risk factor for heart disease (p263), which they are not when age is taken into account (see The Cholesterol Myths, Uffe Ravnskov). Eating fat, unless it was all trans fat, was not likely to be the cause of Elvis Presley's early death (p280). Grinding of teeth while sleeping was adressed with several types of treatments (p283), yet the simple plastic tooth guard was not mentioned. Irritable bowel syndrome (p284) was not connected with grain allergies. SIDS causes (p328) did not include too many vaccines too early in life as a possible cause. <br /> <br /> Despite the caveats, this is a very good book.	2004-10-22

Beautifully written, edited and referenced in academic style, Dr. Angell begins softly and with understatement, building logically to a shattering set of conclusions and recommendations. <br /> <br /> Pharma's claim that high drug prices in the USA are required to support innovative research is shown with plausible data to be false. Most of the innovative drugs are actually discovered in universities, at the NIH and in small companies. Pharma's expenditures for research are shown to less than half of those for sales and marketing and lobbying. About 4/5 of research dollars spent are on \\"me-too\\" drugs that are minor variations on the original drug of each type, and thus of no value to ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> Dr. Angell explains how Big Pharma had patent law changed to obtain up to 23 years of protection. And how minor changes in the drug molecule have somehow become patentable in direct contravention of patent law that obvious minor changes are not patentable. Mere changes in formulation somehow became protected. <br /> <br /> Dr. Angell confirms other reports  that Big Pharma has the most powerful lobby in Washington, resulting in \\"...an iron grip on Congress and the White House\\". Big Pharma has had laws passed forbidding importation of its own drugs from outside the USA. There is no technical justification for this. Big Pharma has arranged that the Medicare Drug Benefit to become effective in a couple of years does not permit Medicare to negotiate prices. This is contrary to the ability of all other national health services in the world to negotiate prices. <br /> <br /> Dr. Angell confirms that both the NIH and FDA are subservient to the wishes of Big Pharma. This is largely done by offering \\"consulting\\" agreements to federal employees, and to members of FDA advisory committees. The FTC and FDA crumbled to Big Pharma's wishes to advertise drugs direct to consumer, a total disaster so far, because the true benefits of many drugs, often quite minor and sometimes even negative, cannot be communicated in a TV ad. <br /> <br /> The pervasive bribing of doctors to prescribe the latest drugs is confirmed. Big Pharma's influence on medical schools is shown, as is the control of Continuing Medical Education, required for certain certifications and hospital privileges. <br /> <br /> \\"The Truth...\\" is truly great because a number of concrete suggestions are made to undo the damage: \\"Despite all its excesses, this is an important industry that should be saved - mainly from itself\\" (p237). Of the suggestions Dr. Angell made, the one most possible to be implemented are removing the control of clinical trials of drugs from Big Pharma and having the NIH do it. (Of course, there is the caveat that NIH employees must stop receiving compensation or gifts from Big Pharma.) Some of the scientific transgressions of Big Pharma in running and reporting on drug trials are given, such as reporting only the positive results, testing healthy adults and then allowing the drugs to be prescribed for sick adults, children and the elderly. Drugs are now tested against placebo. Dr. Angell notes that tests should also include a test group using the current best drug to see whether the \\"new\\" drug is really better. She does not address the lack of benefit of many of the best-selling drugs. <br /> <br /> \\"The Truth...\\" is an oustanding work, in my opinion, and a short review cannot do it justice. <br /> ***** <br /> For a similar expos see \\"Prescription Games\\" by Jeffrey Robinson (2001). Other aspects of Big Pharma excess are given in \\"Heart Failure\\" (1989) and \\"Prescription for Disaster\\" (1998); by Thomas J. Moore; \\"Overdose: The Case Against the Drug Companies\\" by Jay S. Cohen, MD (2001). The misleading presentation of trial results is shown in \\"Calculated Risks\\" by Gerd Gigerenzer (2002) and the peer-reviewed paper: Joel M. Kauffman, Bias in Recent Papers on Diets and Drugs in Peer-Reviewed Medical Journals, J. Am. Physicians & Surgeons,  9(1), 11-14 (2004). <br /> <br /> I have had about 14 years of experience in exploratory drug development in colleges, mostly supported by NIH grants. <br />	2004-09-23

After struggling to read it even after the benefit of attending many seminars on molecular recognition which had the real biochemistry set out, I did not learn anything new. <br /> <br /> Maxwell's Demon is presented (p4) as a contradiction of the second law of thermodydamics. A better description was easily found: [...] <br />This also explains that the demon could not really succeed. Also, this website goves the better explanation of entropy as randomness, not disorder, which is the 19th century German explanation. I do not agree that Figure 1.4.4 contains less information than any of the others. <br /> The author can certainly see the forest for the trees, in attempting a grand synthesis of string theory, quantum electrodynamics, thermodynamics, and molecular recognition. However, there was a serious set of failures to see the trees for the forest. For example, on p30, in the caption for Figure 3.1b, the carboxyl group is identified as COO-. Actually this is the carboxylate anion. A carboxyl group is COOH. An amino group is given as NH3+. In fact this is an ammonium group missing a bond. An amino group is -NH2. In Figure 4.1 on p59 the glutamine is shown with a C-NH3 group with the + charge missing. In this reaction there is ADP on the left with no ADP and Pi on the right. The plus signs are missing. In the caption the ammonium ion is given as NH3. This is quite wrong; it should have been NH4+. <br /> On p60 in Figure 4.2 blue light is shown at 500 nm; in fact, 500 nm looks green. Ultraviolet light is shown as going from 0-290 nm; in fact, the usual definition is that it extends from 150-390 nm. The shorter wavelengths actually encompass Xrays, gamma rays and cosmic rays. The Figure 9.5 on p180 does a much better job with a logarithmic scale, but the ranges of UV and visible light are still odd. <br /> The explanation for the DNA codes for amino acids, the 3-base groups, was very involved. The combinations of 4 DNA bases taken 3 at a time may be simply seen as the minimum information needed to distinguish between about 20 amino acids. Thus 4x3x2x1 = 24. <br /> There must be a better source of understanding on molecular recognition than this.	2004-08-20

The difference between a small anti-scurvy intake of vitamin C, a few milligrams per day, and a therapeutic dose of 10 grams or more per day is made crystal clear.   <br /> The complete lack of evidence for the RDA set by the FDA is revealed. The rapid elimination of vitamin C was shown graphically, thus the folly in the persistent use of multi-gram oral doses by inept researchers was exposed. Small doses must be taken orally, maybe every hour, to keep serum levels up. The increase in serum levels obtainable with injected, not oral, sodium ascorbate, the usual non-acidic salt of vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is explained well. <br /> The flaws in the published studies intended to debunk the usefulness of vitamin C from The Mayo Clinic and The Heart Protection Study in the UK are spelled out in detail. Wrong doses, wrong dosage forms, mismatched control patients, etc., all combined to fail to prove that vitamin C is not effective in treating cancer or cardiovascular disease. The problems with these studies and others is explained in great detail, and you will be able to follow the reasoning of the authors. <br /> Then it is less of a shock to learn that vitamin C can cure polio and prolong lifespan for those with AIDS and cancer, among other conditions.  The studies by Pauling and Cameron on vitamin C for cancer believed invalid by mainstream medicine, were, in fact, as well done as was ethically practical, and were confirmed by unrelated researchers. <br /> My only gripes with this book are the incompetent chemistry on page 63 and some of the explanations of ordinary chemical reactions. Neither hydroxyl radical nor hydroxide ion plus an electron will give water as shown. Neither charges nor atoms are balanced or accounted for.   Many disease states were said to be caused by the presence too many free radicals without enough direct evidence or identification of which free radicals. <br /> That done, my opinion is that this book should be required reading by a very wide audience. Referencing is done to a very high standard. The next edition should be superb.	2004-08-16

Gilbert Welch, MD, MPH, has written an unusually understandable revelation of the folly of testing for cancer  in people with no symptoms. He explains how only a few people will benefit from common tests such as PSA, fecal blood, mammograms and others. He is enough of an insider to be able to explain the flaws in clinical trials being used by \\"authorities\\" to recommend extensive testing, and the lack of trials in some cases. The unneccessary biopsies, surgeries, radiations, chemotherapies for slow-growing cancers or even non-malignant ones are presented bravely. The uncertainty of testing is exposed where a positive for cancer may be wrong 1/3 of the time. And it is up to the patient to get second opinions.<BR> The financial and legal pressures on MDs to test excessively are brought out. There is advice on talking or writing to your MD to indicate your unwillingness to undergo too many tests, and not to hold your MD liable if a cancer was \\"missed\\" - that is the big thing.<BR> The deaths caused by cancer treatment are aired. This is something very few people, even MDs, know. Even when a treatment can cut the deaths from a particular cancer in half, most current treatments create non-cancer deaths, many of which will be improperly reported.<BR> Welch is a special expert on the misleading nature of 5-year survival rates how they can rise because of early detection, yet with no change in the cancer plus cancer treatment mortality rate.<BR> There are good explanations of how 5-year survival rates are calculated, how age-adjustments are made, how randomization for trials is done, and other things not even taught in medical school, but reserved for medical researchers.  And quite easy to comprehend with clear figures and tables.<BR> No errors that I can find; a really excellent book.	2004-05-24

The middle third was the most satisfactory, with details of the various forms of ice, how organisms cope with freezing, and what makes water so unusual. Explanations of its hydrogen bonding patterns and how they might change to make ice less dense than liquid water, and the funny shrinkage of water above its melting point and are all interesting. The many functions of water in biological systems, right down to the molecular level are given, and there are a number of cleverly done diagrams.<BR> Ball's major blunder in this middle part was his complete failure to explain what holds normal liquids together, that is, what are the van der Waals forces (p165)? This leads to an absurd reason for the cohesion cell membranes, where the hydrocarbon tails of lipid bilayers are said to be held together merely by their repulsion of water (p253). Most college chemistry texts do better on both counts (including Linus Pauling, &quot;General Chemistry&quot;, 3rd ed., 1965). The UV light from the sun is presented as detrimental only (p235). Ball seems unaware that vitamin D is formed from the action of UVB on cholesterol in the skin, and that there is less cancer the closer humans live to the equator. In recounting all the effects on the development of life (atmospheric composition, heat, cold, nutrients), Ball ignores the contribution of 10 times the radioactivity the Earth now has in promoting chemical reactions and mutations long ago (see T. D. Luckey, &quot;Radiation Hormesis&quot;, 1991).<BR> More minor problems are speaking of a vacuum \\"sucking\\" (p240), the pH of stomach acid as 1 rather than 1-3 (p247), missing the true function of the Glomar Challenger as a submarine salvage vessel (p47), a confusion of the effect of pressure on a melting point by comparing with the effect of pressure on the the boiling point of water (p51), implying that the reaction of sulfur dioxide with water gives sulfuric acid (p101) rather than sulfurous acid, and that paraffin wax has a viscosity anywhere near as low as 15 centipoises (p282).<BR> It is when Ball enters the realm of politicized science that serious misinformation flows. Water vapor is by far the most important greenhouse gas and human activities add plenty of it to the atmosphere by irrigation, burning methane which puts 2 molecules of water into the air with just 1 of carbon dioxide, of burning gasoline, jet and diesel fuel, unlike p66. See &quot;Hot Talk, Cold Science&quot; by S. Fred Singer.  Cold fusion has been replicated in half a dozen laboratories; the reality of the effect cannot be dismissed by ignoring the publications and merely listing ones that do not show the effect) (p307). See &quot;Excess Heat&quot; by Charles G. Beaudette, 2001.  Memory effects in water at really high dilutions are real (see Lionel Milgrom, New Scientist, 11 Jun 03). Homeopathy effects were demonstrated against placebo in trials (BMJ 1991;302:316-323), all contrary to p334.<BR> Read this \\"chocolate and cherry syrup coated\\" book at your own risk.<br />  --Joel M.

The reality of the effect, observed in at least a half dozen labs, may be seen in the book by Charles G. Baudette, Excess Heat, Why Cold Fusion Research Prevailed, 2000. The effect is being re-investigated by the Dept.of Energy.<br /> In Chap 2, More Guns Means Less Crime, Ehrlich did indeed catch John Lott in a double faux pas in the graph on p23. First, the ordinate does not begin at zero, and this is not indicated on the Y-axis with a break, so the effect noted is exaggerated. Secondly, the perfect fit of points to the curves was an artifact of the computer graphing program in which the points calculated by the program from the real data are shown, not the real data. This may come as surprise, but I have seen this before, in a curve used by the Heart Institute of the NIH to predict all-cause death rates from blood pressure (BP) as a continuous graded thing. In fact, there is little risk until BP reaches the 90% percentile for age and sex (Port S, et al., Lancet 2000;355:T175-180).<br /> But Ehrlich promotes trigger locks on guns in the complete absence of evidence they reduce accidental shootings of children. Ehrlich used an increase in violent crime rate without an adjustment for population growth. He tried to use a selected 10 states to give an overall picture USA robbery rates relative to gun ownership laws. Ehrlich also failed to note crime rate changes in other countries that passed anti-gun laws. All in all, Lott makes his case despite his mistakes; Ehrlich does not.<br /> In Chapter 3, p48, a graph of HIV-positive hemophiliacs in the UK shows no drop in death rates after the year in which AZT was introduced. Ehrlich has no conception of the toxicity of AZT (Moss RW. Questioning Chemotherapy,  Brooklyn, NY: Equinox Press, 2000, p124). HIV passes only the first of Koch's postulates. It has not been isolated in pure form and passed on in pureform.  The HIV test gives false positives with TB and other diseases, and has not spread as alarmists predicted in developed countries (Hodgkinson N, AIDS: Scientific or Viral Catastrophe, J Sci Exploration 2003;17(1):87-120).<br /> In Chapter 4, Ehrlich falls into the trap of using relative risks without absolute risks, a common error [Joel M. Kauffman, Bias in Recent Papers on Diets and Drugs in Peer-Reviewed Medical Journals, J. Am. Physicians & Surgeons,  9(1), 11-14 (2004).] He is blank on the difference between UVB, which produces vitamn D, causes sunburn and the easily treated skin cancers, and UVA, which causes the deadly melanomas. He fails to note the benefits of UVB in reducing rates of breast, colon and prostate cancer. He fell into the trap that eating cholesterol causes coronary heart disease, and that red wine significantly prevents it. He is blank that vitamin D is made from cholesterol by UVB. (See The ProteinPower LifePlan, by Michael R. Eades, MD & Mary Dan Eades, MD.  New York, NY:Warner Books, 2000.) He wrote that diet is not related to obesity, as shown by trials; but he was blank that all the trials he referred to were on low-fat diets, and that all the low-carb trials he ignored have been beneficial for obesity [Joel M. Kauffman, Low-Carbohydrate Diets, J. Scientific Exploration , 18(1), 83-134 (2004)]. On p67, Fig. 4.3, he shows cholesterol concentrations with no units, a sure sign of an amateur. On p71 he thinks that the disappearance of all ozone from the stratosphere would zap everything with UV from the sun; this shows his abysmal ignorance that ozone is made from oxygen by very short UV from the sun, and it would soon re-appear.<br /> In Chapter 5, Ehrlich's dismissal of radiation hormesis manages to avoid all the papers by Calabrese, Wolff, Cuttler, Luckey, Feinendegen, Muckerheide, and many others with 4,500 examples of hormesis in 1,000 papers. By drawing straight line thru data in in Figures 5.4 and 5.5 (pp85,87) he ignores effectsat low levels, and shows his bias [See  Joel M. Kauffman, \\"Radiation Hormesis: Demonstrated, Deconstructed, Denied, Dismissed, and Some Implications for Public Policy\\", J. Scientific Exploration, 17(3), 389-407 (2003).]<br /> This comedy of errors made it foolish for me to continue reading the rest. Buyer beware.      -----22 Apr 04	2004-04-22

Essex and McKitrick, even as outsiders to the field, provide the most entertaining exposé of climate modeling nonsense I have seen. The flaws in climate modeling, the absence of <BR>water vapor as the most important greenhouse gas in most enviro manifestoes, the fraud behind the \\"hockey stick\\" graph of temperature over the last 1,000 years that claims that the 20th century has been the warmest of the millenium, and the lack of coverage of the remaining ground temperature measurement <BR>stations are all revealed, and backed with citations to peer-reviewed journals. Even the dynamics of human group polarization are explained at length as the reason why this subject receives almost no serious scientific discussion.<br /> The hockey stick temperature vs. time graph was defended by its perpetrator (Mann).  A new peer-reviewed article defends the work in the book and amplfies it: Stephen McIntyre and Ross<BR>McKitrick.Corrections to the Mann et al (1998) Proxy Data Base and Northern Hemisphere Average Temperature Series. Energy and Environment 14(6) 751-772. This is one of the few journals on climate that will consider articles with the facts: there is no correlation, as the books shows, with CO2 levels and lower atmosphere temperatures.

US	49326459	R3JTSXKCU2FWNX	376436307X	779485650	HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Milestones in Drug Therapy)	Books	1	2	3	N	N	Misleading Expertise	HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are essentially the statin drugs: atorvastatin (Lipitor), cerivastatin (Baycol, <BR>withdrawn 8/01), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin (Zocor), <BR>pitavastatin and rosuvastatin (Crestor), which were introduced to lower total cholesterol (TC) levels, and especially <BR>LDL-cholesterol (LDL) levels, ostensibly to prevent coronary heart disease (CVD).<br />     The book consists of 8 chapters by nominally highly qualified authors in the form of review articles of the sort <BR>normally found in medical journals.  These are devoted to the pharmacology and supposed benefits of statin drugs.  <BR>The writing is in expert medical language and is consistent, well-written, well-edited and very well-referenced, in <BR>quantity if not in quality.  The index is inadequate.<br />     All chapters attempt to justify the wide use of the statin drugs to lower TC and LDL by citing references in support <BR>of the claims that high levels have been correlated with cardiovascular disease (pp1,19,35,81,84,99,121,126).  Such <BR>claims are unfounded (Ravnskov U, The Cholesterol Myths, Washington, DC, New Trends, 2000).<br />     The supposed benefits of the statins, beyond a large, but meaningless lowering of TC and LDL, are usually given <BR>as lowered relative risks (RR) of mostly non-fatal heart attacks without the slightest indication of the magnitude of the <BR>more meaningful reduction of absolute risk (pp101,103,106,115,122,124,137).  This misrepresentation has been <BR>noted (Ravnskov, 2000; Gigerenzer G, Calculated Risks: How to Know When Numbers Deceive You, New York, <BR>NY, Simon & Schuster, 2002).  So the usual tout of pravastatin in the WOSCOPS trial of a 22% drop in all-cause <BR>mortality was noted without the information that this was only an 0.9% drop absolute in the 5-year trial period <BR>(p106).  The higher all-cause death rates in 2 of the big trials were ignored, as was the higher breast cancer rate (RR <BR>= 1500%) in the CARE trial (Ravnskov, 2000).<br />     Besides cancer, the other side effects of statins listed were incomplete, and should have included myalgia, <BR>myopathy, polyneuropathy, liver and kidney damage, congestive heart failure and amnesia.  Side-effects were said to <BR>affect 2% of patients (p115-6) and 2-6% (p123).  In fact, a recent review noted side-effects in 20% of patients above <BR>the placebo rate, and no change whatever in the all-cause death rate for atorvastatin (Newman CB, Palmer G, <BR>Silbershatz H, Szarek M.  Safety of Atorvastatin Derived from Analysis of 44 Completed Trials in 9,416 Patients.  <BR>Am J Cardiol 2003;92:670-6).<br />     Statins decrease the body's production of the essential coenzyme Q-10 and dolichol, among other things.  This <BR>was not mentioned as a problem in any chapter.  While this was shown in one biochemical diagram (p65), it was not <BR>in another (p82).  Low Q-10 levels are strongly associated with congestive heart failure.<br />     \\"Statins are contra-indicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  The reason for this is that cholesterol is an <BR>essential component for fetal development, including the synthesis of steroids and cell membranes\\" (p116).  The <BR>authors seem unable to comprehend that cell membranes, steroids and coenzyme Q-10 are needed by all humans.<br />     The rare familial hypercholesterolemia, in which TC > 400 mg/dL, was represented as more deadly than it really <BR>is (p99,111), (Ravnskov, 2000).<br />     There was some recognition that statins operate to lower non-fatal heart attack rates by mechanisms other than <BR>cholesterol lowering, but not that their desirable effect on thromboxane A2 is less than men can obtain with buffered <BR>aspirin (p71), or that the desirable effect of raising nitric oxide (NO) levels is less than one can obtain with the <BR>supplement L-arginine with no side-effects.  There was no understanding that these effects of statins are independent <BR>of initial or final TC or LDL levels (Nielsen JV.  Serun lipid lowering and risk reduction? Where is the connection?  <BR>Br Med J Rapid Response,  19 Nov 01, to Kmietowicz Z. Statins are the new aspirin, Oxford researchers say.  Br <BR>Med J  2001;323:1145), and thus there is no way to determine who should be treated, or what the dose should be.<br /> An entire chapter is devoted to the cost-benefits of statin use (p138ff).  Since the use of statins for primary <BR>prevention of CVD has been shown to increase all-cause mortality by 1% over a 10-year period (Jackson PR, et al. <BR>Statins for primary prevention: at what coronary risk is safety assured? Br J Pharmacology 2001;52:439-446), and statins<BR>have very little effect in secondary prevention, it would seem that there is no cost-benefit (Kauffman JM, \\"Do <BR>Hypolipidemic Drugs Lower Medical Expenses?\\"  Pharmacotherapy  2001;22(12),1583-1586).<br /> This book may be of use for a pharmacologist looking for an overview, however narrow in outlook, with literature citations.<br />---Joel M.

There are several main sections to carry the story, and and epilogue.  Pollan's writing is exquisite, nearly poetry in prose with very few incomprehensible lines; the nirvana of his writing is 5-star.<BR> Apples:  Pollan found that there really was a Johnny Appleseed.  I had not known that apples were drunk as cider, hard cider or applejack until better cloned varieties appeared in the late 19th century, which being much sweeter, could be eaten.  The wild Asian origins of the inedible apple were compared unfavorably with the reduction in biodiversity that yielded our 10 or so favorite varieties.<BR> Tulips:  Pollan's parentally enforced tulip plantings were confessed.  The origin of the domesticated tulip in the Ottoman Empire and the wild speculation in 17th century Holland were brought out.  Pollan believes that flowering plants that produced sugars and proteins (p109) made mammals possible.<BR> Marihuana:  Pollan's own experimentation was justified by results - heightened awareness with no bad side-effects.  The US government's war on marihuana was described with the implication that it had no technical basis.  Why were the obvious motives of tobacco, alcohol and drug companies not aired?  The cultivation of marihuana clones hydroponically on a huge scale was described.  The obstruction to the medical uses of marihuana was deplored, and, in my opinion, this is highly justified.<BR> Potato:  The failure of the Irish potato crops in the 1840s due to lack of biodiversity was described.  GM potato with Bt gene (Monsanto's NewLeaf) was compared as an undesirable monoculture, opposite to organic farming of a number of varieties.  The advantages of biological (still chemical, remember) control of pests over chemical control was properly described.  The inherently higher costs of organicly grown potato were acknowledged.  But Pollan ate NewLeaf potato on a farm in Idaho, more of them as French fries from McDonald's, and then refused to eat his own or serve them at a picnic!  All this fuss over possible dangers of eating Bt, yet not a word about the absolutely known dangers of trans fat in those fries!...Like too many non-chemists, Pollan made some blunders: \\"...since sugar is the form in which nature stores food energy\\" (p19). Other than in sugar cane and beets, the primary storage in plants is as starch and cellulose. In animals it is glycogen and fat. (John de Man, Food Chemistry, 3rd ed., Aspen, Gaithersburg, MD, 1999.)<BR> Here and there global warming by humans is noted as a given, when of course nothing of the sort has been proven, or even accepted by a majority of scientists and engineers (S. Fred Singer, Hot Talk, Cold Science, The Independent Institute, Oakland, CA; Bjørn Lomborg, The Skeptical Environmentalist, Cambridge University Press, 2001; and now C. Essex and R. McKitrick, Taken by Storm, Key Porter, Toronto, 2002, available from Amazon Canada).  <BR> One of the most egregious eco-lies of all time is repeated as gospel (p211): that DDT caused thinning of bird eggshells, and loss of bird populations.  This nonsense is exposed in S. Fred Singer, Science does not justify Ban on DDT, Environment & Climate News, 2003;6(3):2; Adam J. Lieberman, Facts vs. Frears: A Review of the 20 Greatest Unfounded Health Scares of Recent Times, American Council on Science and Health, 1997... <BR> Another is that \\"we\\" have no idea how to safely dispose of nuclear wastes (p215).  In 1978, Norman Rasmussen, Professor of Nuclear Engineering, MIT, described how nuclear fuel assemblies were placed under water until the short-lived isotopes decayed, then reprocessed to recover uranium and plutonium, the remainder being cast into cement in stainless steel drums which could safely be stored.  All the uproar has been over where to store the drums because eco-nuts have labeled them as highly dangerous.  (See Dixy Lee Ray, Trashing the Planet, Regnery, Washington, DC, 1990, pp147-156.)<BR> Some pesticides are described as \\"chemicals of unspeakable toxicity\\" (p216).  This epithet should be saved for nerve gas, aflatoxin, botulinum toxin and coral snake venom.  Pollan should give thanks that we do not have to use bleach or drain cleaner as pesticides.<BR> In the end the main thesis is not supported.  Plants do what they do, and the presence of animals and insects will favor some of their activities.  Pollan's view is actually extremely humanistic, which is OK, but with a technophobic slant, some of which may turn out to be justified; but it is anything but \\"a plant's-eye view of the world\\".  Pollan often failed to check viewpoints on which there is legitimate controversy, and parroted anti-technology views consistenly.  How appropriate that this book is classified under the Dewey Decimal System as philosphy rather than science or technology!	2003-05-09

Furthermore, the resistance from other scientists of their times is still surprising to some of us, while the resistance of the Catholic Church is not.<br /> Guillen's efforts to provide clear explanations for the discoveries mostly succeed, least well for Clausius's Second Law of Thermodynamics, in my opinion.  Many clever similes are used.  A better explanation of the inverted delta in Clerk-Maxwell's equation on Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction is needed.  Guillen defines it as \\"the amount of\\" (p158), while \\"the rate of change\\" might be better.  The math does not go beyond high school algebra, with that one exception, so the mathematically challenged such as this reviewer need not fear.<br /> What is very disappointing is the number of errors:<br /> 1. On p27 globes are said to 2-dimensional, when they are actually 3-dimensional; circles are 2-dimensional.<BR> <BR> 2. On p36 et seq planetary motion around the sun is said to follow oval paths, when the paths are actually elliptical.  These are different shapes.<br /> 3. On p137 the Leyden jar was said to be the forerunner of the modern battery.  In fact is was the ancestor of the modern capacitor.<br /> 4. On p139 Volta's piles were said to provide more current the higher the pile, meaning the more plates).  In fact, more plates gave more voltage, not more current.  The two terms are not interchangeable.  The piles were said to be the ancestor of today's storage batteries, while, in fact, they were the precursor of today's \\"dry\\" cells, which are not rechargeable.<br /> 5. On p158 the general term \\"electricity\\" was used instead of the proper term \\"voltage\\" (E).<br /> 6. On p162 a perpetual motion machine seems to be described inadvertently by the supposed possibility of using an electric motor to spin a dynamo that, in turn, powers the motor.  This is not possible, of course.<br /> 7. On p163 the term \\"current\\" is used instead of \\"voltage\\"; these have never been interchangeable.  The current is the number of electrons passing a certain point per second, while voltage is the unit of electrical pressure.<br /> 8. On p163 the term \\"heat\\" is used instead of \\"temperature\\".  Thermometers measure temperature; calorimeters measure heat.<br /> 9. On p187 there seems to be total confusion between heat capacity and conduction.  The apple filling in a pie is mostly water which has high heat capacity and good conduction, so it is easy to be burned on hot filling.  The crust is mostly carbohydrate with air pockets, almost a foam, and the combination of low heat content at a given temperature and poor conduction makes it harder to be burned by the hot crust.<br /> 10. On p246 the speed of light was said to be constant. This should have been qualified from the start as being in a vacuum, as was done from p248 et seq.<br /> 11. The gross structure of the atom was worked out by Ernest Rutherford et al. in 1911 by bombarding gold foil with a beam of alpha particles from radium, not in the 1930s with \\"atom smashers\\" (particle accelerators), p258.<br /> 12. Einstein's 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics was for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, not for quantum mechanics (p259), which Einstein never even accepted!<br /> Other Amazon.com reviewers found other mistakes as well.	2003-03-13

The origin of the modern age of medicine did not occur in 1928 when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug.  One could date it from 1897 when Felix Hoffman at Bayer A.

These dangers involve possible escape of the artificially inserted gene(s) for pesticide or insect resistance, overspray of pesticide onto non-resistant crops, insects acquiring resistance to the Bt gene, corporate control of seeds to be used with specific herbicides, failure of transgenic crops, and the lack of increase in crop yields. All of these are genuine concerns, for which the authors admit that there is no proof, just worries; but the advantages get short shrift.<br /> No evidence is presented on actual failures except for one set of transgenic cotton plants. Escape of genes could be fought with new seeds not containing the gene. The dread that insects will build resistance to the natural bacterial toxins of the Bt gene is poorly couched, because all prior experience is that insects will do so in time, and the amount of time is all that is in doubt. Corporate control of seeds and herbicides will last only as long as the patents, and then \\"generics\\" are likely to appear. We have had corporate control of hybrid seeds and pesticides for 3/4 century as it is. If crop yields become significantly lower, the transgenic strains will be dropped. It is unlikely that all crops will fail at the same time.<br /> Nobel Prize winner Norman E. Borlaug, the father of the green revolution, and not an inventor of transgenic plants, could have spoken against them, but has done the opposite. In the Wall Street Journal, 22 Jan 03, pA.14, he wrote: \\"Although there have always been those in society who resist change, the intensity of the attacks against GM crops from some quarters is unprecedented and, in certain cases, even surprising, given the potential environmental benefits that such technology can bring by reducing the use of pesticides. Genetic engineering of crops -- plant breeding at the molecular level -- is not some kind of witchcraft, but rather the progressive harnessing of the forcesof nature to the benefit of feeding the human race. The idea that a new technology should be barred until proven conclusively that it can do no harm is unrealistic and unwise. Scientific advance always involves some risk of unintended outcomes. Indeed, \\"zero biological risk\\" is not even attainable.<br /> \\"Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa says he's been told by anti-biotechnology groups that donated American corn is \\"poison\\" because it contains GM kernels. Based on such misinformation, he is willing to risk thousands of additional starvation deaths rather than distribute the same corn Americans have been eating for years with no ill effects.\\"<br /> Another cautious, reasonable view is that of Bjørn Lomborg, The Skeptical Environmentalist, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2001, pp342-348. Examples of faked data on the toxicity of GM potatoes on rats and overblown fears of the effect of Bt corn on the monarch butterfly were given. Lomborg thinks the gains are worth the risks, and advises proceeding very cautiously, thus not to drop all the GM programs.<br />*****<BR> The main reason for my 1-star rating for this book is not its conclusions, but its style. Despite academic-style referencing, albeit with almost no peer-reviewed papers on the actual subject of GM foods, the authors use practically every ploy practiced by propagandists.<br /> The herbicide bromoxynil is said to have a toxic nitrile function (p.viii). The most common nitrile, acetonitrile, has an LD50 orally in rats of 3800 mg/kg, thus is less toxic than salt!<br /> A \\"...horrible debacle from overuse of DDT...\\" (p.16) is not exemplified, but we are to think it had to do with thinning of birds' eggshells, which was disproven before DDT was banned in the USA by the EPA.<br /> \\"Many countries like India are at the balance between survival and famine\\" (p.17). Then how is it then that 1/2 of south Asian adults are overweight and 1/3 are obese? (Lancet 2003;361:79).<br /> \\"But the metabolic fate of DBHA [metabolite of bromoxynil] in the mammalian body has never been studied -- or at least reported\\" (p.42). A quick search of PubMed turned up: St John LE, Lisk DJ. Fate of the herbicides bromoxynil and casseron in cows. J Dairy Sci 1967;50(4):582-4.<br /> The paucity of chemical knowledge of these authors is shown by the following: \\"Bromoxynil octanoate, the active ingredient in bromoxynil, is converted into bromoxynil phenol (what we have been calling DBHA) when it is metabolized in mammals. Although this step is designed to detoxify bromoxynil and make the molecule more easily excreted by the body, the by-product remains at least as toxic as its parent compounds\\" (p.43-4). The octanoate ester is the oil-soluble form of bromoxynil used in formulations; it is not the active form, which is bromoxynil itself, which is a phenol, so should not be called \\"bromoxynil phenol\\". Since most bromoxynil is metabolized to its acid derivative, DBHA, this \\"by-product\\" cannot be more toxic than its parent.<br /> \\"Roundup [glyphosate] may also damage many non-target plants\\" (p.54). Well, of course! How many of us use Roundup to knock off all plants before seasonal planting?<br /> \\"In 1993, 6 out of 7 plots...showed lower yields for conventional vs. transgenic soybeans\\" (p.83). This is exactly the opposite of one of the main points these authors tried to make -- that GM plants give lower yields!<br /> Several times the authors trot out the old vegetarian aphorism that cattle convert their food to meat with only 10% efficiency (p.87), with 12% efficiency (p.112,135), and with 40 % efficiency (p.147). The authors do not seem to understand that humans do not like to eat wild grass, hay, alfalfa, or soybean hulls.<br /> Diethylstilbestrol (DES) which had been used in cattle feed with some health problems in humans is trotted out like DDT as a scare mechanism, but it is not a plant product or a result of GM foods.<br /> The \\"undesirability\\" of corporate profits is emphasized many times.<br /> An attempt is made to foment alarm in orthodox religionists by hinting that GM foods may not be kosher or Halal.	2003-02-13

Anerobic exercise utilizes 14 times as much glucose as aerobic does (Bernstein 1997, pp179-190).  Heart disease patients are very little aided by hard exercise (Dorn 1999).<br /> All carbohydrates are said to contain similar amounts of energy (p19).  They do not, with fiber contributing none and other carbs various amounts up to 4 kcal/g (Livesey 2001).  Complex carbohydrates are said to break down more slowly than simple sugars (p20).  This does not explain why many complex carbs have a more serious effect on blood glucose levels than some simple sugars.  The important notion of glycemic index (GI) is missing, even when recommending for Type 2 diabetics, thus the recommendation for 50-60% of their diet to be complex carbs (p207) has no basis in reality, and is quite destructive (Bernstein pp33-48, 121-140). Everyone is said to require a minimum of 100 g/day, and that 300 g/day is ideal for most people (p20).  Actually there is NO carbohydrate requirement for humans.  Glucose is made from amino acids when needed (Ottoboni pp25,85).  Ask any Eskimo! (McGee 2001 pp82-86,109).<br />  The GI is measured in humans by checking blood glucose levels after eating.  The GI of a food shows the % glucose levels rise compared with the same weight of glucose (GI = 100).  One of the things that creates high (bad) insulin levels is high blood glucose levels.  Since all the common complex carbohydrates (starches) in foods are polymers of glucose, and some of them are metabolized very rapidly into glucose, and we eat more of them by weight, the contribution of wheat, corn, potato and other forms of high-GI starches to poor health is greater than that of many of the the simple sugars.  The so-called low-carb diets must be low GI diets to be effective, and they really are for weight loss, and the prevention of type 2 diabetes.<br /> Fats do not all contribute 9 kcal/g to human energy when eaten.  To begin with, this book give 9 calories per gram (p21); this is incorrect by 1/1000; the correct unit is kcal/g or Cal/g.  Fats actually run from 5.5 kcal/g for cocoa butter (Apfar 1987) to 5.9 for beef fat (Carlson 1968) to 8.5 for corn oil (Carlson 1968).  Unsaturated fatty acids are said to have points in the chemical attachment that are missing (p21); this is a fairy tale.  There is a typo that is very destructive in which linoleic acid is said to be an omega-3 fatty acid (p22); actually it is an omega-6.  The authors warn against taking supplements of one type only (p22), and are unaware that there is far too much omega-6 in the American diet compared with the usual smaller amounts of omega-3 (Ottoboni 2002, pp45-54).  And the authors are blank on the evils of trans fats, even in the tables! (Oomen 2001; Willett 1993; Wood 1993).<br /> This entire book is permeated by the biggest fraud in the history of nutrition  that eating saturated fats and cholesterol will lead to atherosclerosis and heart failure.  This nonsense originated with a campaign by the American Heart Association (AHA) begun in 1961, and its anti-cholesterol, pro-polyunsaturated fat campaign, which peaked in the 1980s.  Nothing in the Framingham, MRFIT, or any other honest study actually supports this anti-fat stand, despite the politically correct summaries of many of the studies. (Moore 1989, Smith 1991, Fehily 1993, Fraser 1997, Tunstall-Pedoe 1997, Eades 2000, Enig 2000, Kauffman 2000, Kauffman 2001, McCully 2000, McGee 2001, Ottoboni 2002, Ravnskov 2000).<BR> The unfounded advice of the authors of this book on diets for diabetics, and for all in avoiding staturated fat and cholesterol in favor of omega-6 and trans fats (Vos 2003), and their ignorance of of GI in recommending complex carbs severely limits the usefulness of this Alamanac, despite the presence of some accurate information on other topics.<br />For complete references cited e-mail me at ...	2003-02-05

The notion of glycemic index (GI), now >80 years old, never entered Critser's mind. The GI is measured in humans by checking blood glucose levels after eating.

This was accompanied by the blunder that all carbohydrates were eliminated, including the ones with very low GI from fruits andvegetables. As it happens, clinical trials have shown that low GI diets are the only ones most people can maintain. The usual sensible recommendation is for 40% calories from low-GI carbohydrates, 30% from fats, and 30% from proteins (Eades 2000, McGee 2001, Ottoboni 2002).<br /> On the same plane in blunderland, Critser actually succumbed to the biggest misinformation in the history of medicine: that eating saturated fat and cholesterol causes obesity or clogged arteries or heart disease (p15,140). This nonsense originated with a campaign by the American Heart Association (AHA) begun in 1961, and its anti-cholesterol, pro-polyunsaturated fat campaign, which peaked in the 1980s.

The occasional success of people on the Pritikin and Ornish diets may be due to lower total calories or avoidance of bad fat. Also, many other lifestyle changes were made in addition to diet. Fat makes the stomach empty more slowly, thus keeping the blood glucose concentrations lower (Enig 2000).<br /> Speaking of bad fat, Critser's dump on palm oil (p13-19) is totally unfounded based on actual cohort studies (Wood 1993, Enig 2000). To \\"compound the felony\\" Critser failed to warn about the really bad fats, namely the omega-6 fatty acids among the polyunsaturated fats such as soybean, corn, safflower and sunflower oil (Wood 1993, Enig 2000, Vos 2003), nor was there much on eating the good omega-3 fats (Vos 2003). Not a word about avoiding trans fats, as though this were still in doubt (Willett 1993, Oomen 2001). Even the AHA began to warn about trans fats in 2002. Among the saturated fats, the medium-chain ones are lower in calories (8 kcal/g) than theunsaturated ones (9 kcal/g), and the 18-carbon stearic acid in cocoa butter and tallow are so indigestible that these fats provide only 5.5 and 7.5 kcal/g (Finley 1994).<br /> \\"When new immigrants were asked whether rest was more important or better for health than exercise, a large portion 'always says yes'.

Critser's unquenchable recommendations for exercise have some merit (Bernstein 1997), but the only prospective, randomized study of exercise after heart attack found no effect of exercise on all-cause death and a slight benefit of exercise on cardio-vascular mortality for the first few years, disappearing at 5 years (Dorn 1999).<br /> While Critser was correct to pick on Reuben Andres, MD, for certain reasons, Critser fell for the nonsense that being leaner is better and leads to longer life.

In my opinion he has done an astounding job of comprehending the broadest possible range of environmental concerns.  The many reviews already posted on [Amazon] show an almost complete polarization between the environmentally brainwashed and the hardheaded skeptics.  Many of the reviews indicate that this massive book was read only in part by many; I assure you I read it all, and that it took months.<br /> Lomborg set out his philosophy clearly:  Most of us desire to increase the quality of life for the greatest number of people.  We do not advocate eugenics.  We accept that there will never be enough money to do everything that governments might like or be asked to do.  Priorities should be set to maximize the benefits of the decisions that are made.  As well or badly as we have done, we could easily do better.  Much of \\"The Litany\\" on present and predicted disaster is not based on facts, and is done to attract funds to the agency or organization or author of environmental alarms.<br /> The disparity in results of expenditure to gain lifespan are staggering: from <$30/life-year saved from requiring smoke detectors in homes to $20 billion for further tightening benzene emission at rubber tire plants (Table 9, p340).<br /> Lomborg uses many sources, including peer-reviewed, to conclude that human caused global warming will be much less than the most dire predictions, and that it may cost less to deal with it than to attempt, perhaps in vain, to prevent it.  He acknowledges that the warming we have had in the last 100 years is for warmer nights in arctic regions, which are very welcome to the local residents.<br /> The failed predictions and/or false premises of Rachel Carson, Lester Brown, Claude Martin, David Pimentel, Paul Ehrlich, Al Gore and others are neatly punctured.<br /> That said,there are a few important errors which could be corrected in future editions. The common chrysotile asbestos is not toxic in other than massive amounts to non-smokers (pp184,229,335); only the other forms not commonly used in the US are toxic.  (See Dixy Lee Ray, Trashing the Planet, Washington, DC: Regnery Gateway,1990.)<br /> Low-dose radiation from Xrays, gamma rays and radon is actually beneficial, and does not follow the \\"linear-no-threshold\\" relationship (pp183,231,247,337,340) . (See Dixy Lee Ray, Trashing the Planet, Washington, DC: Regnery Gateway,1990; Mortazavi, SMJ, <[...]>, 31 Aug 02.)<br /> Contrary to p321, cold fusion has been replicated in at least 6 laboratories (See Charles G. Beaudette, Excess Heat: Why Cold Fusion Research Prevailed,  South Bristol, ME: Oak Grove Press, 2000.)<br /> The role of water vapor as a greenhouse gas is underplayed (pp258-324).  (See Lomborg's ref. to Lindzen, 2001 <[...]> and S. Fred Singer, Hot Talk, Cold Science: Global Warmings Unfinshed Debate,  Oakland, CA: The Independent Institute, 1999.)<br /> Despite these few errors, and provided that the references above are available to compensate for them, I cannot recommend this book more highly, whether for general edification or as a text for college courses in economics, environmental science, political science and toxicology.  The wonderful rationality of Lomborg's outlook, especially including consideration of the costs of doing anything or nothing, direct and indirect (see Henry Hazlitt, Economics in One Lesson,  New York, NY: Arlington House, 1979); and his courageous debunking of alarmist nonsense, naming the names, should earn him well-deserved fame and fortune.	2002-10-17

It was a revelation to read that there is 50 times as much CO2 in the ocean as in the air, and that the burning of all fossil fuels would only double the conc. to 0.06% in air, and that the oceans would eventually knock it down to 0.03% again.

The worthlessness of synthetic mixed progestins compared with real progesterone was known for decades, and the recent expose on HRT using progestins should NOT discourage women from doing it effectively!<br /> There are a number of lifestyle messages that seem very reasonable, such as avoiding mammograms, some better than average diet advice, and warnings on the toxicity of so many prescription drugs.  Other claims such as environmental toxins being major causes of cancer are unproven.<br /> But the overall problem with this book is that there was no quantitative data on the effects of any recommended intervention.  There was no data on % of women who contracted breast cancer who were not taking progesterone compared with those who did.  There was no data on how much more lifespan (or how much less all-cause mortality) one could obtain from progesterone treatment.  There was no data on the % of women who would actually have the non-cancer benefits of using progesterone.  There was no data on increased lifespan or quality of life when the diet interventions were followed.<br /> ****<br /> On pp102-104 an example was given of a trial of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (Pg) creams applied to breasts 10-13 days before surgery to see how cell division rates were changed.  The findings on p104 seem to relate to the un-numbered lower bar chart on p103.  E2 was said in increase cell division rate by 230 %.  Since the placebo rate was 8 on the ordinate, 230 % or 2.3 x 8 = 18.  When 8 is  increased by 18 the result is 26, which is not what the bar chart indicates.  Pg was said to decrease the rate by 400%.  Since 400 % of 8 is 32, 8 -32 = -24, which is absurd.  A cell division rate cannot be decreased to less than zero.  I guess they meant to say that the rate under placebo was decreased by 75%.  This would fit the bar chart value of 2.<br /> *****<br /> On p110 the free-radical oxidation of catechol estrogens was described.  Just plain catechol can be written as:  1,2-(HO)C6H4(OH)  Free radicals are any type of atom with an unpaired electron, not electrons, and not just oxygen atoms.  When a free radical reacts with catechol electrons are not removed alone, as this would lead to 2 or more positive charges, not a new radical.  A phenolic hydrogen atom with 1 electron (a hydrogen radical) is what is actually removed to give this radical:  1,2-(HO)C6H4(O*)  This does not go around looking for electrons.  If it accepted just 1 electron, a phenoxide anion would be produced, and more electrons would not be accepted.  If the phenoxide radical is to become a quinone, it must lose the other phenolic hydrogen atom:  1,2-(*O)C6H4(O*)  This diradical would instantly rearrange to the quinone:  1,2-(O=)C6H4(=O)  The damage may be done by the hydrogen radical.  All these radicals are neutral in charge.<br /> So far as quinones being always dangerous and needing inactivation, one need only look at the vital ubiquinone (vitamin or coenzyme Q10) to see the exception.<br /> ...ess they meant to say that the rate under placebo was decreased by 75%.

This practice is much more common in the relationship between male doctors and female patients.  ...too many women take drugs they do not need, undergo an excessive amnount of unecessary surgery...\\" (p8).  \\"Everything I am going to say is based on scientific evidence that has already been published in the world's leading medical and scientific journals.\\" (p12).<BR> <BR> The Spotty Science: In giving the caloric content of foods, Dr. McDougall mistakenly gives calories rather than kilocalories per gram (kcal/g) (p341). (The kilocalories are often written as Calories in other literature.) He correctly states that some fats are partially absorbed, cutting their caloric content in half; but is unaware that most common fats and oils provide only about 5 kcal/g (Kekwick A, Pawan GLS, \\"Body-Weight, Food, and Energy\\", The Lancet 19 Apr 1969:822-825.<BR> Dr. McDougall fails to note that some of his supposed successes, like those of Pritikin and Ornish, may result from any of multiple interventions, including placebo effect, as well as the elimination of the toxic trans fatty acids along with all other fats (Oomen CM et al., \\"Association between trans fatty acid intake and 10-year risk of coronary heart disease in the Zutphen Elderly Study: a prospective population-based study\\", The Lancet 2001:357:746-751; the facts were known much earlier, as in the book \\"Know Your Fats\\".<BR> Dr. McDougall has fallen for the cholesterol nonsense, hook, line and sinker (see Uffe Ravnskov, \\"The Cholsterol Myths\\", 2000; Mary C. Enig, \\"Know Your Fats\\", 2000; Kilmer S. McCully, The Heart Revolution\\", 2000; all available from Amazon.com).  He also managed to avoid citing a single paper from any of these 3 key authors.  Meta-analyses of 24 cholesterol-lowering diet trials found that there was no significant effect of low-fat diets on total death rates (Garber AM, et al., \\"Clinical Guideline, Part 2. Cholesterol Screening in Asymptomatic Adults\\", Ann Int Med 1996:124:518-531).  Dr. McDougall cannot distinguish between complex carbohydrates and high-glycemic carbohydrates, so he is unaware that the wheat flour and potato in his recipes are death warrants for diabetics (Richard K. Bernstein, \\"Dr. Bernstein;s Diabetes Solution\\", 1997).<BR> The downside of vegetarianism is omitted by Dr. McDougall... Some excellent advice on the low benefits of mammograms is marred by Dr. McDougall's failure to mention the hormetic benefit of the Xrays (Upton AC, \\"Radiation Hormesis: Data and Interpretations\\", Critical Rev Tox 2001:31(4&5):681-695), and the availability for 9 years of a simple blood test to detect cancer ....<BR> <BR> Because of some serious misinformation in this book, it cannot be recommended at all despite its content of very good information on certain other topics.  ---7 Jun 02	2002-06-08

Self-Defense Against Health Scares and Scams by Steven J. Milloy, Cato Institute, Washington, DC, USA, 2001, ix-xii + 218 pp.<br /> A superb manual for understanding health claims and detecting fraud, \\"Junk Science Judo\\" is written in a punchy, easy-to-read style that allows the mathematically challenged, like myself, to interpret the usual bell-curve statistics that are used for environmental health threats and diet threats.  One may also use this approach to judge the benefits of prescription drugs or alternative treatments.  He shows how to look for p  values of 0.05 or less, and he shows how to use the 95% confidence intervals (CI) to see whether the low or high limit crosses the reference value of 1.00.  If it does, Milloy suggests disregarding any result that is claimed. <br /> In epidemiological or ecologic studies, Milloy suggests discarding those results in which the relative risk (RR) is between 0.5 and 2.00, whichever applies.  Milloy goes far beyond the usual cautions that an association is not necessarily a cause. He is contemptuous of, but not totally dismissive of epidemiology.  For Milloy, the descending pecking order of research on health hazards is: clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and ecologic studies.  He describes publication bias, confounding, and \\"tainted experts\\".  He reminds us that mice are not little people, and that there is a safe dose of everything.<br /> Milloy encourages intelligent contact with the sources of health advice to support or refute the recommendations, and he recommends a number of sources of supposedly reliable health information.  His criticism of medical journals, which includes the defects of peer-review, is the most detailed I have seen in print, and very well-taken, in my opinion.  He skewers broadcast media on their emphasis on ratings rather than accuracy or balance.  He deplores the motivation of many activists.  Many specific examples are given, from Alar to radiation.<br /> This book is extremely valuable for helping anyone who is not a medical or epidemiological specialist to judge the value of health or health-threat claims.<br /> Now the bad news.  Milloy does not question the use 1-tailed statistics, or the failure of many relationships to follow a bell-curve (Kauffman, 2001).  Milloy failed to warn of the common deception of reporting an effect of something on a certain health condition without the inclusion of total death rates.  Milloy's fine example of prostate cancer \\"non-prevention\\" by eating foods high in selenium (p164) may mislead people into ignoring the benefits of selenium supplementation, which has been shown in a clinical trial to lower the RR of all cancers to 0.83 (95% CI 0.47-0.85), and is most effective against lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers (Clark et al., 1996).  Milloy downplays the dangers of trans  fats (Oomen et al., 2001), but his own example shows that the highest two quintiles of consumption are not healthful  (p165).  Milloy made the mistake of writing that the absence of a biological explanation for the claimed effects of electric and magnetic fields means that they have no effects (p76); readers of JSE  know that such judgments based on lack of knowledge are faulty. ....<BR>Joel  M.

The main oil used in cooking was said to be canola oil.  Since canola oil is a recent invention, becoming common only in the last 20 years in Canada and the USA, it could hardly have been a benefit to Okinawans who are now very old.<BR> My co-workers at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, Mignon S. Adams and David C. Geliebter, spent a month in Okinawa recently, with special attention on food.  They did not see any canola oil in use.  The common oils were peanut (16% SFA), soybean (15% SFA), rapeseed (1% SFA) and lard (44% SFA).  Data are  mostly from Mary C. Enig, Know Your Fats, Bethesda Press, 2000.<BR> The Okinawans also eat significant amounts of pork and moderate amounts of chicken, both of which contain considerable SFAs.  There is no unbiased evidence that SFAs are unhealthful (Taubes G, Science 2001:291:2536-2545).<BR> This was confirmed by Stephen C. Byrnes, who lives in Honolulu, HI, and has friends raised in Okinawa.  They ate fish, rice and vegetables, but pork and lard \\"...have always been the mainstay of this people's diet\\".  Sally Fallon and Mary C. Enig quoted an Okinawan professor who wrote that the Okinawan diet was \\"greasy and good\\".<BR> ****<BR> The glycemic index table was incomplete, missing all the good foods that have very low glycemic indices that diabetics can eat, such as nuts, cheese, fats, oils, and meat.  Diabetics have been punished for decades by being handed tables such as this where they might assume that foods not included should not be eaten.  Nuts, in particular, despite their carbohydrate content, have very low glycemic indices, and high nut consumption is strongly associated with longer lifespan (Hu FB et al., British Medical J. 1998:317:1341-5).<BR> ****<BR> These authors seem to have had a hidden agenda.  This book is certainly not recommended.	2002-03-17

The tendency of the the Food &amp; Drug Administration of the USA (FDA) to approve drugs from major existing manufacturers after insufficient testing, and to resist new drugs or treatments of any kind from small-scale inventors is presented in the most upsetting revelations I have seen about the FDA to date, and in highly readable style.<br /> The Forward by former U. S. Congressman Berkley Bedell and the Introduction by Julian Whitaker, M. D., are good recommendations.  The latter still has a reputation and a practice to protect.<br /> There is a war between the supporters of non-toxic treatments, (which are sometimes just dietary changes, or use of supplements) and prescription drugs.  The latter kill 140,000-180,000 Americans per year, far more than all the traffic, airline, suicide and murder deaths per year.  Because of the staggering cost of testing, even quite inadequately, of new drugs, there cannot be comparable testing or advertising of supplements or herbs, many of which are non-toxic, so results from smaller trials along with clinical experience should be considered seriously in evaluating alternative treatments.<br /> Most of the chapters describe treatments for cancer that have been reported to succeed.  Most have decades of actual use.  Haley explains that the FDA's identification of Krebiozen (for cancer) as creatine was a fraud (p167).  I can vouch personally for the lack of toxicity and effectiveness for burns of DMSO, the subject of one chapter.  The FDA's effort to discourage use of DMSO by falsely attributing a toxicity to it is revealed.  My other reading has persuaded me that the antineoplastons of Stanislaw Burzynski, M. D., are an effective treatment for brain tumors (Kauffman, 2002).  Burzynski has been a long-term punching bag of the FDA, being subjected to indictments, raids,etc.  When the National Cancer Institute was to have tested  antineoplastons from Burzynski, it ignored his instructions so that their tests would fail, then falsely reported that there were never any successful tests, and was generally destructive, according to Haley.<br /> The ability of the American Medical Association to coerce State Licensing Boards to lift licenses of supposed quacks has been \\"justified\\" by claiming that the public is being protected, according to Haley.<br /> The book Definitive Guide to Cancer (Diamond et al., 1997) supports all the alternative cancer treatments in Haley's book.  In addition, the book Racketeering in Medicine, supports Drs. Ivy (krebiozen), Hoxsey, Burzynski (antineoplastons), Rife, Naessens (714X) and others (Carter, 1992).  Naturally, [...] advises against every single treatment.<br /> Author Daniel Haley advocates abolishing the National Cancer Institute under a 10-year sunset edict, a good idea, in my opinion; and removing the ability of the FDA to interfere with use of non-toxic treatments, supplements or herbs.  The fact that 65-73% of FDA employees did work or go to work for the drug companies the FDA is supposed to be regulating has to destroy any confidence in the FDA's impartiality.  Most people do not know that the FDA does not test drugs itself, but reviews the test results submitted by the drug companies.  Much can be hidden by clever experimenters, and this, too, does little for our confidence.  Haley recommends that the FDA be barred from regulating harmless substances, from trying to direct medical practice, and discouraged from perpetrating surprise armed raids.  He presents two carefully crafted bills, the Access to Medical Treatment Act and the Health Freedom of Choice Act.  Haley cites a key quote attributed to the late Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, made on the floor of the U. S. Senate on 6 Dec 63: \\"It's a terrible thing that we cannot really trust either the FDA or the NCI!\\" (p7, 162, 341, 404, 418).  A recent book by Jay S. Cohen, M. D., has two chapters on the conflicts and incompetence within the FDA (Cohen, 2001).  The Independent Institute has launched a new website on the foibles of the FDA and suggestions for its reform: &lt;[...]  Its thesis is: \\"We argue that the FDA control over drugs and devices has large and often overlooked costs that almost certainly exceed the benefits.  We believe that FDA regulation of the medical industry has suppressed and delayed new drugs and devices, and has increased costs, with a net result of more morbidity and mortality.\\" (Tabarrok et al., 2001) <br /> Among minor flaws, yhere were too many misspellings.  Unfortunately, there were also a number of chemistry errors or ambiguities that cast doubt on the accuracy of some of the descriptions of cures.  On being informed of many of these errors or ambiguities in chemistry, Daniel Haley, not being a chemist, and trying to make sense of information from some scientists who should have known better, was concerned, and is working to eliminate these errors in future printings or editions.  Such an effort would go a long way to making Politics in Healing more credible overall.  Whether any medical treatment works has no relationship to the existence of any theory or explanation.  Both the tendency to support the efficacy of any medical treatment by a clever theory as well as the tendency to disparage any treatment for lack of a theory should be suppressed.<br /> The strength of this book is its depth of study of the political and economic forces applied against certain pioneers in medicine, their heroic attempts to survive, and the very specific reforms recommended for the FDA and NCI.<br />References<br /> Carter, 1992.

With a very personal beginning resulting from his wife's near death and slow recovery from taking ONE PILL (Floxin), author Fried went on to find whether there were other victims (many), and why the drug was approved in the first place. Interviews in profusion show why the FDA has its problems. Examples are given of the tendency of drug companies to defend their drugs at any cost regardless of evidence. The end of the book contains addresses of many drug companies, organizations to whom to report adverse drug reactions, and a sample form to send to the FDA. Well thought-out advice for patients (or their helpmates) to investigate drugs are given. A number of other good books on the subject are listed.<BR> Fried is to be congratulated for doing a very accurate job with a minimum number of accusations. I did not find a single technical error in the entire book, and I have about 12 years exploratory drug development and teaching about it as a professor of medicinal chemistry.<BR> Even Fried may not have realized how many drugs not discussed in his book shorten life, because they are tested and accepted based on surrogate endpoints for short periods.  This may not be so bad for antibiotics that are taken for two weeks, but can be very destructive for drugs intended to be taken for 20-40 years.	2001-09-09

The authors make a solid case for the use of L-arginine as a safe supplement that lowers blood pressure and prevents atherosclerosis, and cite good peer-reviewed articles in medical journals profusely. I now use L-arginine myself. So why the 2-star rating? The authors have been taken in by what is called the biggest fraud in the history of medicine, the diet-heart fraud. Other books available make it quite clear that eating saturated fat and cholesterol do not cause atheroslerosis, and that high serum cholesterol (below 400 mg/dL) does not cause atherosclerosis or heart attacks. For example, there is Robert J. Moore, &#8220;Heart Attack&#8221;, 1989; Russell L. Smith, &#8220;The Cholesterol Conspiracy&#8221;, 1991; Kilmer S. McCully and Martha McCully, &#8220;The Heart Revolution. The Extraordinary Discovery that Finally Laid the Cholesterol Myth to Rest and Put Good Food Back on the Table&#8221;, 2000; Uffe Ravnskov, &#8220;The Cholesterol Myths. Exposing the Fallacy that Saturated Fat and Cholesterol Cause Heart Disease&#8221;, 2000; and Charles T. McGee, &#8220;Health Frauds: Uncovering the Biggest Health Scam in History&#8221;, 2001. Because of the total confusion over cholesterol and saturated fat, the usefulness of this book is seriously compromised. The authors even went so far as to compare L-arginine to lovastatin, calling the latter &#8220;the gold standard&#8221; for lowering cholesterol levels (p92). The truth is that in both of the reports on the two placebo-controlled clinical studies published so far, the total death rate of patients on lovastatin was higher than for patients on placebo. A further problem is the continual admonishments to &#8220;see your doctor&#8221;, &#8220;ask your doctor&#8221; as though more than 1 physician in 100 would have the slightest inkling of the benefits of L-arginine. If youare to depend on your &#8220;doctor&#8217;s&#8221; endorsement of L-arginine, you will be very disappointed. Most of you will have to make your own decisions. The physiological diagrams photoreduced for this paperback edition are unreadable, even with a magnifying glass, because they are too small and lack resolution (see p80). The authors also caution men not to use L-arginine in conjunction with sildenafil (Viagra), but provide no experimental evidence whatsoever for their opinion, along with the usual &#8220;ask your doctor&#8221; about the combination, as though most MDs would know. My personal experience is that the maximum allowable dose of sildenafil, 100 mg, is effective for me, with the side-effects of abdominal pain, blurred vision, and headache; while 50 mg of sildenafil taken with 1 g of L-arginine is even more effective, and has no side-effects.	2001-08-25

US	49326459	R2NZCLU6WUH0MS	0967089700	571956709	The Cholesterol Myths: Exposing the Fallacy that Saturated Fat and Cholesterol Cause Heart Disease	Books	5	293	301	N	N	Exposing the Cholesterol Mafia	With courage and care Dr. Ravnskov exposes the lack of experimental evidence for the diet-heart theory, which claims that eating less fat and cholesterol will prevent atheroslcerosis (hardening of the arteries) and myocardial infarctions (heart attacks).   By examining original peer-reviewed literature, the author finds no support for the diet-heart theory.  He gives examples of scientific fraud among efforts to support the theory, including the deliberate selective omission of data points, and the deliberate assignment of subjects in a clinical trial to treatment or to control groups by physicians with the subject's medical records in hand.    He shows how the abstract or conclusions of a number of papers are at odds with the actual data in the papers.  He demonstrates how the use of one statistical method in preference to another can give a false impression that there is an effect,where there is, in fact, none.  He shows how the reporting of differences in fatality rates by per cent reduction (say, a 50% reduction in relative risk) is actually misleading when the actual death rates are quite small in both the treatment and control groups of subjects in diet or drug studies.  For example, a treatment that changes the absolute survival rate over a multi-year period from 99.0% to 99.5% represents a 50% reduction in relative risk, from 1% to 0.5% absolute. This is often described in papers as a 50% reduction in death rate.  However, when the difference is barely significant statistically, as was often the case, Ravnskov points out that there is no real reason to recommend adoption of the treatment, especially if there are serious side-effects.<br />  &#8220;The truth, were it known, would send pharmaceutical stocks plunging. In most studies, the increased risk is present only above a level of cholesterol that includes just a small percentage of the total population.  [These are the approximately 1% of people with a genetic defect called familial hypercholesteremia.]And women can stop worrying immediately because high cholesterol is not a risk factor for the female sex.  Few comments have been made on this peculiar fact in all the vast literature on cholesterol.  When it is mentioned at all, it is said that female sex hormones protect against heart attacks.\\"<br /> &#8220;In fact, it seems more dangerous for women to have low cholesterol than high.  Dr. Bernard Forette and a team of French researchers from Paris found that old women with very high cholesterol live the longest. The death rate was more than 5 times higher for women who had very low cholesterol.  In their report, the French doctors warned against cholesterol lowering in elderly women.  But they could as well have warned against cholesterol lowering in any woman, or, to be more precise, in anyone at all.\\"<br />  Dr. Ravnskov went on to show that higher levels of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL, \\"good\\" cholesterol) are not protective against CHD, and that lower levels of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL,\\"bad\\" cholesterol) are not beneficial, although the expected associations of each with CHD are present.  Here again, conclusions at odds with the researchersí own data were presented. Intimations that there are &#8220;many&#8221; or &#8220;definitive&#8221; studies in reports and papers were shown to be false by showing that citations often led to other reviews, each trusting the last, and ending at very few original studies.<br /> &#8220;High-fat foods raise blood cholesterol.\\"  Dr. Ancel Keys was one of the main proponents of this myth.  In a paper published in 1958, Keys showed a graph of the per cent calories from fat in the food of various countries vs. the mean serum cholesterol levels.  The data points fell on a straight line, showing an excellent correlation.  Dr. Ravnskov added data points from a number of countries deliberately ignored by Dr. Keys.  These fall nowhere near the line.  Furthermore, CHD death rates among subjects in Finland, Greece and Yugoslavia with similar serum cholesterol levels varied 5-fold depending on which area of the country they lived in!<br />     Four studies in the US, one in the UK, one in Israel and one in Finland failed to show any correlation between diet and serum cholesterol  levels.<br />     &#8220;Numerous studies have shown that in people who eat a normal Western diet, the effect on blood cholesterol of eating 2 or 3 extra eggs per day over a long period of time can hardly be measured...\\"<br />  Ravnskov presents the results of a number of trials of statin drugs in which total death rates are slightly lower than those of the controls.  In an early trial of lovastatin (EXCEL) on 8,000 subjects the absolute death rate from all causes after just 1 year was 0.5% vs. 0.2% in the placebo group.<br />      Kilmer S. McCully, Ph. D., M. D., in technical papers and a book: &#8220;The Heart Revolution:  the Extraordinary Discovery that Finally Laid the Cholesterol Myth to Rest&#8221;, Harper Perennial, 2000, wrote: &#8220;But no study anywhere has ever proven that lowering the amount of cholesterol in the diet reduces the risk of heart disease.  And lowering cholesterol through drugs won&#8217;t prevent arteries from hardening if homocysteine is high.&#8221;  McCully is the discoverer of the fact that the undesirable amino acid called homocysteine is an actual cause of atherosclerosis and CHD.<br /> Based on Ravnskov&#8217;s meticulous analyses as well as the considerable support for his stance shown by others who have also studied the cholesterol data, this book is recommended without reservation. Physicians and other health professionals as well as anyone threatened with cholesterol-lowering treatments would be enlightened, and better able to resist worthless treatments.  Health insurers might reconsider compensation for frequent (or any) clinical assays for cholesterol or triglycerides, let alone expensive treatments to lower cholesterol levels that reduce quality of life without prolonging it significantly.<br />...	2001-06-12
