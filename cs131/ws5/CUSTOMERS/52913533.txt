Articles covering the same topic are presented as chapters with some introductory text to set up the articles.  <br /> <br />The book is excellent. Dr. Krugman clearly explains Bush's plans regarding taxation, social security, Medicare, the war in Iraq and many other issues. I have never read a more lucid clear explanation of any economic issues. A word of warning, this book will make you mad. Once you realize the amount of damage Bush's policies have done you'll be shocked.  <br /> <br />Read the book, hopefully before Election Day and think hard about how much more damage could be done. This is a must read considering the election is not that far away. <br />	2004-09-18

I laughed so hard I almost peed in my pants. I immediately ordered the book and read it in a couple of days. The book is really funny, you'll find yourself laugh out loud all the time. Everything about his stories are great, he is honest about his less that completely normal life and family.  <br /> <br />Naturally some of the stories are better than others, some just get an occasional smile, but some will have your sides hurting.

US	52913533	R9BKPABEGUQC7	0385486804	674569455	Into the Wild	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A moving sad story	Chris McCandless was an idealistic young man who ventured out into the wilderness alone, made a few mistakes and died. This doesn't seem like much of a story but Krakauer does a wonderful job of reconstructing the last years of McCandless's life and give some insight into this man's motivations.<br />I personally don't think McCandless was a crazy loner or anything like that. He was a very idealistic man who saw the purity in nature and wanted to be a part of it. This certainly has some appeal to me. I found myself identifying with McCandless quite a bit. I've often felt the urge to split and wander about for a few months. He was quite personable with the people he met on his travels, and he touched the lives of several of the poeple he met.<br />It is tragic that he died, if he had only had a simple map of the area he would have survived his excursions and been able to return to his life. It seems like he was ready to re-enter the world when he died.<br />Krakauer tells the stories of other men who have been similarity affected by nature and have traveled into the wild never to return. Despite the tragic ending, I found the book inspiring and I do certainly admire Chris McCandless's courage for leaving behind everything and venturing out for what can only described and a personal adventure with an uncertain ending.<br />I'd highly recommend this book to anybody, my tiny piece of advice for anybody considering this sort of travel is to get a good map, good boots, a warm coat, and be prepared for anything	2004-03-01

Whenever I travel I like to eat the local food, good or bad. Honestly most everything is great. I loved the fact that the only thing he hated was the hygienic vegan food he ate at some constipated fancy dinner party. I feel the same way. <br />The book was an engaging read and I like the way he didn't shy away from the slaughter that precedes most of his meals. That is what is takes and I'm glad to see somebody is happy to describe it and then readily consume whatever animal has so recently been unceremoniously killed. It is a great book, not for the weak stomached, but great nonetheless.<br />I'd recommend it to almost anybody. As a person who has eaten camels, snakes, porcupines, jellyfish, insect larvae, and virtually every organ found in vertebrates I feel like Mr. Bourdain is a kindred spirit. Read the book and start your own eating adventure	2004-02-12

It must have been amazing to have trekked across such unknown wilderness and interact with the local villagers and see a part of the world that virtually no western eyes have seen. It must have been extremely difficult to deal with the reality of overexploitation of wildlife to trade for something as mundane as salt. Rabinowitz doesn't paint the local people as uncaring monsters. They are just trying to make a life for themselves and their families. <br />I would have like a few photographs of the animals, but this isn't a field guide. Overall the book was very good. I liked the way the Dr. Rabinowitz made the point that if any conservation effort is going to have even the smallest chance of being successful the local government and more importantly the local people need to be involved from day one.	2003-12-24

I found myself laughing out loud many times. I read it in just a few days; I couldn't put it down. Al Franken is just hilarious. His interactions with conservative political figures are so funny. His conversations with Barbara Bush, his challenging Rich Lowry to a fistfight, his exchange with Mr. OReilly were so funny I nearly peed in my pants. <br />Woven into all of humor is a fair criticism of how conservative politics is so unapologetically full of BS. It is nice to see somebody pointing how frequently and how badly conservative talking heads just make stuff up that fits their point of view. Im no fan Bush, so I was happy to devour every page of this book. <br />I recommend this book to anybody; I hope everybody in America buys a copy of this book	2003-12-23

The stories do a good job of capturing the life and death struggle in one the last remaining truly wild places in the world. The chapters concerning his stint as a war photographer in Uganda and the murders in the forests in Uganda provide a chilling reminder of what is really going on in Africa. <br />The book was great, it read well and the stories were excellent. I highly recommend this book to anybody with even a passing interest in African wildlife or Africa in general. The chapters that don't deal with the wildlife serve to remind people that despite the undeniable natural beauty of Africa it is a dangerous place.	2003-11-23

I played romance of the three kingdoms on my Nintendo when I was in high school. A few years ago I started playing the dynasty warriors series of games on the playstation. I had always wanted to read the novel, and I'm glad I did. The story starts around 185 AD, just at the end of the Han dynasty. It continues until the end of the Han dynasty in 220, and finally to the reunification of china around 280. The principle characters are rulers, generals, and politicians that make up the Wu, Wei, and Shu kingdoms. <br />The book is really fast read, considering that the book is 2400+ pages long, it really didn't take that long to read. It is interesting and something is always going on. I don't think I would have enjoyed being a third century Chinese general. They have a pretty short life. It was kind of sad when character that I really like got killed, but considering the time span of the novel it was bound to happen. The novel does focus on the time period from 185-220, after that things start going pretty quick and after 235 AD the story is essentially over, except for a few details. <br />I can't recommend it enough, you could read it 50 times and still get something out of it. If I were stuck on a desert island, this would be one of the books I'd like to have. Now all I need to do is visit china and see some of this stuff from the book	2003-09-19

This book does a good job of exposing the underbelly of the conservative right. Man, it can get ugly down there! Brock's unflinching story does not pull any punches and he names all the names.

Nobody likes mosquitos, they are annoying little beasts and some of them may just kill you. The book starts with a summary of how mosquitos live and reproduce. The only complaint that I have is that I wish this section was a little longer. I would have liked it if the book went into a bit more detail about the diversity of mosquitos. I liked the way the book described the influences that mosquitos have had through history. The sections about yellow fever and malaria are informative. I really enjoyed this book. It does give you a good feel for how these little terrors are dealt with. The books is a fast read and it keeps your interest. If you travel or have an interest in mosquitos, this would be a good read.	2002-01-11

Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions	Books	5	16	22	N	N	Excellent	This book porvides good detailed accounts of a whole bunch of frauds and delusional people who practice paranormal stuff. Randi exposed psychics, dousers, card readers, ESP, and a whole host of other tricks of the trade. Randi is relentless, and at times not very nice to these people but he is a necessary voice of reason. I'd say that James Randi and Martin Gardner are the best introductions to the skeptic world. Actually it is kind of sad that if your a person who thinks about things and questions what peole say, you get labeled a skeptic. I think people who give things careful thought and don't just accept any explaination should be called reasonable. Needless to say the book is great. It is a bit out dated but the information inside is very good and it reads very well. You won't be sorry to have this book. It can open your eyes. If you give this book are open minded read, then you'll never look at a psychic that same way. Don't hesitate to buy it. I just loved the book, it also make a good reference for debating any of this nonsence with people.	2001-11-26

You don't need to know any physics or chemistry to read, understand, and enjoy this book. He discusses subjects like cold fusion, electromagnetic radiation, homeopathy, touch therapy, and host of other dubious claims. He does this clearly and logically and he points out that many people start down these paths with honest intentions but somehow cross the line into lunacy or fraud. I would recommend this book to anybody. He doesn't have the usual manner of a skeptic who pokes fun of practitioner of bogus science, he just explains what they are trying to say and clearly demonstrates that they are overwhelmingly wrong and in may cases trying to steal innocent poeple's money. Get the book you won't we sorry. He makes the point that the more the public knows about science the less likely it is to get duped by voodoo science.	2001-11-05

I was born in 1973, and ever since I was a kid all I've heard is how the baby boomers have done everything. No matter what was being discussed, it had been done before by some boomer. It seems that somehow every concievable thing was done in the 60's and 70's. We could be talking about music, politics, beer, ANYTHING. So here I am a genration X'er who detests boomers and I see this book. I read it in a day and I loved it. It does not have the stinging insults like George Carlin, rather it consists of well thought out, well-written attacks on the boomers as a whole. Queenan picks on music, SUV's, the whole greatest generation bit, how great the 60's were, boomers facination with options, and over-stimulated kids with moronic names like Dakota. I loved it, he does this well without name calling (I would have liked some name calling). He does point out some of dumb stuff about my generation, like our obsession with coffee shops (I buy my coffee at gas stations) and extreme sports. The book is a worthwile read and you'll think about it whenever you are gettting a lecture about how your music is just a rip-off of Alice Cooper, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, pick a boomer band (When a 24 year-old tells me that he thinks the Led Zeppelin is the greatest ban ever, I usually want to throw up). I you hate boomers you'll love the book (not all boomers are bad, but as a whole they stink). If you are a boomer, read the book and change your ways or else it is a nursing home for you when you get old.	2001-11-05

There were some problems in my calculus classes that I just gave up on after 20 mins. This problem has people giving up on it for 350 years. Fermat's last theorem is simple and elegant and it stumped dudes with stratosphereic IQs for centuries. This book starts with a good history of number theory, starting in ancient Greece and progresses up to Andrew Wiles, the guy who finally crack the problem. It is kind of funny, the problem could be written on a bar napkin. The proof ended up being 130 pages long and involed almost all of the newest mathematical developments of the 20th century. It is a great book, there are so many interesting characters, I really enjoyed it. It isn't technical and certainly doesn't require a math degree to understand. It was a fun little book, and it a fast read. Don't miss it.	2001-10-02

It is basically a collection of essays that Gardener has written for the Skeptical Inquirier. These essays are really informative and sometimes down right hilarious. He is basically pointing out how silly lots of fringe science is. Things like ufology, urine therapy (that is a gross one), and other paranormal ideas. After reading this book you realize just how many fruitcakes are wandering around the world. Some of these fruitcakes are well educated, some are run of the mill crazy people, and sadly I think that many of them are fakes who prey unsuspecting people.  This book should be required reading, so many people get sucked in by these fruitcakes and end up buying super magnet chairs or signing up for a $3000 workshop about remote viewing. You can't under estimate how much influence these fringe groups have. I mean there are even psychics for dogs. If your a skeptic (or just an ordinary person who thinks about things) and want a good laugh get the book. If your thinking about the validity of some lunatic fringe idea, then read the book and you will realize just how big of a mistake you were about to make. If your a psychic, dog energy channeler, or a practitioner of reflexology read the book, you may see the error in your ways and rejoin the real world. Actually, if your heavy into one of these silly practices you'll just get ..., which is fine. Afterall, you can't expect to steal people's money and not get a little heat for it.	2001-09-06

I had kind of a strange reaction to this book. One concept Peter Huber presents is the idea of conservation in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt. His point is that conservation is achieved but setting aside large chunks of land, and letting that land be &quot;wild land&quot;. Fine by me, you'll get no argument from me on that point. I don't think that anybody who is serious about conservation would have a problem with that approach. From that point on, is where myself and many of the &quot;soft greens&quot; start to disagree with Huber. He talks about how the ideas of resource limitation and over population are just myths proported by soft green (who are the bad guys in his mind) who are over dependent on simplistic computer models. He states that only free markets can overcome pollution and industrial waste problems. Some of these concepts are hard to swallow.<br />   He uses the classic tactic of generalizing his oppontent's arguments until they become silly. When you do this, it is hard to take your arguments too seriously. I think the real value of this book is not so much his ideas, but that he challenges the environmental community to re-evaluate its thinking. There has certainly been over zealous claims and predictions in the environmental community. Huber is stabbing at the foundations that helped produce these. I'm still a student and I don't have a wealth of experience to draw upon, so I really can't say with a high degree of certainty that Huber is totally right of totally wrong (it sounds like he is being overly optimistic about a market based solution to our environmental woes). This book certainly pisses people off, but if because of the book causes an &quot;environmentalist&quot; re-thinks his/her core beliefs, then it has served a purpose.	2001-09-03

This book and my experiences in graduate school really opened my eyes as to what a university professor really does and is expected to do. This book give a realistic account of what happens to assistant professors. This is one of the main factors that lead me away from that line of work. There are many little bits of information (that probabally have been learned the hard way) in this book that can really simplify your life if your looking for a science career. It isn't long and it doesn't matter how busy you think you are, if your going into the sciences your absolutely have to read this book.

The screen saver I downloaded is called juliasaver and basically calculates different fractal patterns in real time and displays them. I would sit and watch the everchanging patterns of colors on my computer screen in the dark for long periods of time (not hours, but long enough). They were complex and beautiful, I've even saved a few to use as backgrounds. I know very little about chaos, I knew that the chapter on chaos was towards the back of my calculus text book (a book I must admit, I hated opening). I also knew that it wasn't a simple concept but I was curious about how it worked. So I got this book. The book gives a good description of how the field got started and what the basics are. This isn't a textbook and it doesn't require a degree in math to read it. At times I had to stop and reread passages to understand what was going on, but given the complexity (no pun intended) of the subject, you'd almost have to. I liked the book a lot and it was a fast read given the subject matter. Gleick is an excellent writer, this isn't his best book (Faster is his best), but that is due to his choice of subject matter and not his writing. If you want a good review of chaos that doesn't require a math degree to understand, then this is the book for you.	2001-09-03

It starts with a history of the event and the major players and then goes into a fairly detailed description of what happened and who said what (the trial was a huge event, bigger than OJ). It's funny the whole got started in an ice cream parlor. It is a great book, especially since some states are still struggling with teaching evolution. As somebody that is firmly in the evolution camp and finds the words &quot;creation science&quot; to be one of the world's best oxymorons, this book is quite humorous. The transcripts of Clarence Darrow grilling Bryan about the bible are worth the price of the book. Clarence Darrow would have been a really interesting man to meet. The trial took place in the 1920's and still today this is a relavent issue someplaces. I'd recommend this book to anybody, maybe not a super creationist but those guys would be too busy rereading the bible and filling web pages with gibberish to bother reading it.	2001-09-03

The research was carried out in the early 1980's in the Cockscomb basin in Belize. The area is now a jaguar preserve and if your headed to Belize it is a must see. The book describes the 2 years that Dr. Rabinowitz spent researching jaguar movements in Belize. You really get a feel for how conservation research interacts and sometimes conflicts with local villagers, the government, and how it is preserved in the US. I reads like an adventure story and is not boring. You certainly don't need to be biologist to like this book. I think that anybody could take something away from this story. If your going to Belize, then you should really consider adding this to the list of books to read before you go.	2001-09-01

You can see the authors' passion for rain forests while you read it. The chapters are short and insightful. They don't cover any subject with a great amount of detil but if they did the book would be 2000 pages long. You don't need to be a specialist to appreciate this book. The concepts that are presented are explained by using stories from the authors' experiences in the rain forests. It is a super intorduction, if your planning trip to Costa Rica, Belize or any other tropical country to see rain forests, you would really enjoy your experience more after reading this book. Like the authors say, rain forests can seem a little dull because all you see is a tangle of green under a dark canopy. After reading this book you'll begin to see things that you normally would look for.	2001-09-01

This one was the best, It had more in it than others, and provided better discriptions that most of the others. The reviews of the places were honest and the prices were usually about right. The edition I used was a 2000 edition, I think that this is the most up to date lonely planet guide for Costa Rica, but I could be wrong. The is no guide book that has everything but this is the best I've found. If your only going to buy one guide book or if you are thinking about a trip to Costa Rica and want some information, I would highly recommend this book. The section in the back with animal descriptions is also very nice. Get the book, and the go to Costa Rica, you'll love it.	2001-09-01

However, the book itself is not that great. There isn't much information and lots of the smaller places to see aren't mentioned, or if they are it is just a very little bit. The major stuff to see is here, and the restaurant descriptions are good. But if your wanting to do something off the beaten path this book will not provide you with the information you need. Sometimes having more than one guide book can be helpful, this would make a good secondary guide book. It isn't all bad, but you'd be better off with the lonely planet book. The map was a nice feature and it did come in handy several times.	2001-09-01

I had no idea what international politics was like. Saddam is a scary dude and he's commited to build up his arsenal of particularly nasty weapons. Butler explains how UNSCOM (the group that was to insure that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction were neutralized) tied to carry out its mission despite the attempts of the iraqis and some of the members of the UN security council. It opens your eyes and makes you see that they are serious threats to peace, and that air raids may not solve the problems. You get a good explaination of how the convuluted world of UN politics works. There time when the book bogs down in details, but finally international politics is all about the details and the wording. It is a great book. Weapons of mass destruction can effect everybody in the world, so unless you live in an underground bunker in the Artic, this book is worth your time.	2001-08-10

Suffice it to say that everything that can go wrong does. I've had a lot of personel experience in Cameroon and I can say that everything that happened to this guy didn't sound that far fetched. It is laugh outloud funny. I just couldn't put it down. If your looking for a funny read, then this book is for you. This is a fun book, it is not meant to be some philosophical consideration about the status of Africa or anything like that. There are several excellent and very seroius books about Africa, but this is not one. This book is an adventure story. It is hilarious, I was kind of sad to finish it. It made me want to go back to Africa and they my hand at driving from Capetown to Tunis. Don't miss it.	2001-08-10

It is just an explaination of how freshwater behaves on earth. It explains groudwater, rivers, lakes, water cycle, and the functioning of aquifers. The focus of the book was on North America and in particular Canada and the North of the United States, that's okay but she spends several pages about bogs and fens and one small paragraph about the forested wetlands and mangrove wetlands. I think the lady is Canadian, so she writes aboput what is around her. That is fine, it liked that book and would recommend it to somebody who has an interest in the science of things around us. Many poeple think that water comes from the faucet and that is all. She provides an excellent explaination of where is goes from and where it goes.	2001-08-10

Carlin can piss off anybody, he even pisses me off at times, but I'm laughing all the way. Truthfully only about 3% of what Carlin says pisses me off, but it doesn't matter, he is still the best comedian around. He doesn't back down, I've seen most of his HBO specials and he has gotten more aggressive over the years, but I digress. The book is super funny, since I'm pretty familar with Carlin's material (I've been a fan since I was 9 years old) about half of the material in the book was just stuff from his acts. That is to be expected, but brain droppings seemed less familar to me. Don't get me wrong I think everybody should buy this book. Plenty of people will get pissed off, but most of them will laugh. The child stuff is the best. Carlin is a national treasure	2001-08-10

John Oates shows how the modern concept of community based conservation that looks so good on paper, in reality has been a dismal failure in West Africa. He provieds several examples from his 30 year long career in West Africa. He shows that you have to be realistic when designing conservation programs, and that many people making conservation decisions are more interested in prestige and money than they are in preserving natural ecosystems. It is sad when you read that the World Wildlife Fund conservation planners are not interested to even go see the areas that they are supposed to protect. The intrinsic value of nature is a hard sell, but finally the utilitarian view of nature seems to always lead to exploitation, and increased pressure on the areas that are supposed to be protected. He also very clearly demonstrates that the idea of using zoos for conservation is a bad one. Zoos are probabally the best way to educate the public about conservation, but are very poor ways to protect species, in fact zoos can even do more harm that good. This book really open your eyes, the situation isn't hopeless, but if conservation projects in Africa are going to work, then it has to be done with a realistic approach and the intrinsic value of nature needs to be on the fore front of the effort.	2001-08-10

He talks about the developemt of the concept of zero through time. People hated it, people got killed over it. The greeks seemed to really be against it. It has to be said that some of the greek math guys were a bit weird. One of them had some kind of personal hatred of beans that eventually caused his death. The book is about the development of a mathematical concept but it is not as boring as that sounds. Seife is a witty writer and keeps your interest. He also provides some good mathematical proofs to show the importance of zero. If your looking for a gripping, suspenceful novel then this is not for you. However, if your looking for an informative thought provoking book that is written in a dry, witty style, then this is one for you. I was very happy with it.	2001-08-10

America is obsessed with time, after reading this book I began to see its influence everywhere. I loved the concept that there is a negative correlation between free time and success. I makes you realize the folly of it all. After reading this book, when you see people who are running around, on their cell phones, trying of organize and multi-task their lives (you may be one of them) you'll smile a bit. They're places where doing things faster is better (computers for example), but for many things there comes a point where faster is not better, or cheaper, or anything other than faster. It makes you think, actually if you stop what your doing, clear your head, and think about how time has influenced your life, then this book has achieved its purpose (I think, but then again I don't have a cell phone, and I rarely multi-task so what do I know). No pun intended, but the book is a fast read. The style is engaging and the material is just great. I really liked Choas (a previous book by James Gleick), but this is the his best book. I would recommend this to everybody. It won't change your life, but it will shift your perception a little.	2001-08-10

This book does a very good job of introducing the place and providing insights into wildlife, culture, orgins, and a possible plan for the future of conservation in Madagascar. It reads well and doesn't bog down very often. The chapters about the herps of Madagascar were my favorite, but I am biased towards herps. The conservation issues are presented in a balanced way, and the opposing opinions about the success or failure of the Community development/national park conservation plans are pretty well explained. I recommend this book to anybody wanting to learn more about Madagascar, it is a great introduction would be a worthwhile read if you wanted to travel to Madagascar and be more than just a bumbling tourist.	2001-08-10

I've read both books and I prefer this one. There was less of his stand-up and more original material (at least it was new to me). You just can't say enough about Carlin, this is probabally the funniest book I've ever read. If your going to read it in public, be prepared to be asked to leave the room or told to stop laughing. Something in the book will make you mad, but it you will laugh at the same time. Buy the book, in fact buy 10 copies and maybe Carlin will write another one.	2001-08-10

It starts out with a good basic overview of the area. I used the book on a recent trip to La Paz. The maps are excellent and very easy to use. The prices are a bit off at times but still in the  range. The hotels are broken down into price categories, that was very  helpful. The book helped with getting around by bus and the restaurant  sections gives good accurate descriptions. This book was just super. If  your going to Baja, anywhere in Baja, get this book it is well worth the  price.	2000-06-26

The ant perspective was kind of a cool way to present the information. He does a good job of presenting ants and their ecological  importance without getting so technical that it sounds like a paper in  ecology. He did focus on Costa Rica but how can you blame somebody for  doing that. I really got into it. The way he divided the story between the  ants and the ant guys, E. O. Wilson namely, was a nice change of pace. It  reads fast and the glossaries in the back help with any terms that aren't  familiar. I really enjoy it. Buy the book, you'll learn lots and you will  be entertained at the same time.	2000-06-26

Granted, there is very little is known about this wonderful creature. At times it seemed like the author was just trying to fill pages but with the giant squid, you have to do something. I liked that  he did go into how the animal was discovered and how our knowledge of giant  squid has developed through time. This is undoubtly one of the coolest sea  creatures in the world, so it was nice to get a pretty thorough story. He  does describe some of the many other squids, I liked that because he gives  you a feel for how diverse and cool squids are. It did get a little slow  towards the end but I was still very pleased with the book overall. This  book gives a very complete treatment of this legendary beast.	2000-06-26

It builds nicely on the basic concepts presented in Ishmael. There is a bit more of a story and the book's layout is strange. There is a section in the back that  has the public teachings of B. This is kind of cool because you can skip  the story and just read the sort of lectures. You end up jumping back and  forth if you want to read everything in sequence. The Book is excellent. It  makes some good points and goes further than Ishmael did. It really is one  of those life changing books. It challenges you to think about the modern  world. It does a good job of showing that the stock market and SUVs won't  help to stop humanity from destroying itself. It does a good job of showing  how relgion has aided in the degredation of the earth. There is also a very  cool interpritation of the nature of the anti-christ in the book. Somebody  with more religious convictions than I would probabally find this book more  troubling, but I would recommend it to anybody. Read Ishmael and then read  the Story of B. You may hate it (probabally not), but it will make you use  your brain.	2000-04-27

It flows very well and what Daniel Quinn has to say can open your eyes to what is happening around you. Once you read the book you can see how the takers mindset has provided a justification  for what humans have done to the earth. We will not destroy the earth, we  will destroy ourselves.       Towards the end of the book he makes a point  that evolution has a tendenacy towards complexity. He says that there is a  progression from ultrasimple to more complex forms throughout time. This is  totally wrong! Evolution has no overall tendancies. This is a human made  bias. The most common (by many orders of magnitude) forms of life are and  have always been bacteria. Large, complex, and intelligent organisms  (vertebrates) don't even make up one-tenth of one percent of the species on  earth. Man is not an inevitable product of evolution. I realize that I am  being a little picky, but Daniel Quinn is misrepresenting evolution in this  case. In all fairness, this is a small part of the book and does not  detract from the main concepts of the book. This is certainly not a reason  to  not read the book. I still recommned the book the everyone. It will  help to open your eyes to what is going on around you.	2000-01-17

It is one of those books that you are sad to finish. The essays are short and insightful. Many of the marine organisms presented are totally  overlooked by virtually everybody, but Martin Wells does a great job of  discussing their lives. It is not all strict science, at one point he  wonders if limpets ever feel lusty. It is a real joy. If anybody has any  interest in marine biology, SCUBA diving, or pretty much any interest in  the sea, read this book.	1999-12-04

The genocide that took place in 1994 was so horrible that it is hard to descirbe. This book is wonderful, it is really hard to read and many times I found myself speechless after reading a few  pages. It is very hard to believe. The history leading up to the genocide  is almost as shocking as the genocide itself. It is amazing that the  country is still around. Everybody should read this book, it really shows  what humans are capable of.	1999-10-22

I realize that this type of research goes on all over the world, including here in the United States,  that only makes this subject more frightening. The stories about the  accidents, cover-ups, and the back door dealings really showed how the  military system worked in the former Soviet Union. The book was great, it  clearly showed the progression of bioweapon research from the earliest  parts of the twentieth century to the recent and probabally still ongoing  research today. Who in there right mind would want to make an ebola-small  pox virus? I highly recommend this book to anybody with an interest in  world affairs.	1999-10-05

The central idea that he is proposing is very cool. He makes an excellent arguement. I can  remember being taught that evolution lacks forsight and that goals are not  part of the program. Even though this is what is being taught, Gould shows  that people still have the notion of progress firmly attached to the  concept of evolution. He makes a good point, the anology of the tail  wagging the dog makes it very clear. My fiends and I have always gotten  into arguements over who ruled the modern world, was it man or insects (I'm  no entomolgist but I chose insects). Gould makes it very clear that we were  all wrong and that bacteria by most standards rule the world. OK fine,  bacteria rule the world, but snakes are much cooler. I'm not a baseball  fan, but his baseball section was really intersting and a good read. I knew  that they kept stats, but I had no idea they kept that many stats. Overall  I enjoyed the book. The main idea is going to stimulate lots of people.  This book will make you think, some people hate it and say that Gould is a  fool with an inflated ego, some poeple love it and praise Gould for saying  what needed to be said. Both of these reasons make this book a worthwile  read. It's probabally not the best book he has written. But I'd certainly  recommed it to anybody who has an interest in evolutionary biology (read  Wonderful Life first).	1999-10-01
