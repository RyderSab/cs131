Nor for reading aloud to someone, unless you'd like to be arrested.<BR>Keep in mind that the author of this brilliant, often hilarious 100% scatalogical account of time behind bars is guilty of the crime of which he is accused, and doesn't waste our time denying it. His is a frightening lesson as to what consequences exist for poor choices made. A valuable book if for no other reason.<BR>But other reasons for reading this there are aplenty. The cast of characters bring a whole new meaning to the word &quot;memorable&quot;. Your worst nightmare come true. And yet there is humanity even among the least human of hard-timers - not much, admittedly, but it exists. I most enjoyed how our &quot;hero&quot; takes the many lessons he has learned in the corporate business world and applies them to the chaos he finds around him, often saving his life in the process. A MBA has rarely been used so successfully or in such surroundings - and how interesting to note the similarities between the prison ethos and the business world.<BR>I've rarely before read a book which had me going back to reread certain passages -partly to get a grasp on the new language, which is not one taught in most schools. I often stopped to read parts aloud to my husband, but was usually laughing so hard I couldn't be understood (just as well, I suppose) And yet the tragedy of such an existence is obvious - wasted lives, young men (children in some cases) thrown into a world which will change them forever, murderous rages caused by the slightest of unintentional offences and no way out for most.<BR>It's a shame that the suthor didn't recognize his splendid gift for writing long before his incarceration. Of course, if he had, we may not have ever been treated - if that is the right word - to this incredible book. Too bad he has had to live his account rather than making it up. But nobody could make this up - don't miss it.	2003-09-29

Sheba Hart,a silly 45 year old pottery teacher, married and with two children, becomes passionately involved with a 15 year old student. That both women are unaware of their self-deception is at the heart of this well-told novel. Barbara has a psychological need to be needed, and this obessiveness has cost her any meaningful friendships she might have had. Sheba is unable to free herself from her obsession - the 15 year old student with whom she takes fearful risks. Sheba makes Barbara her confidant, setting in motion the events which lead to disaster. The author has created two monsters, although neither one is aware of the consequences of their actions. The reader feels occasional twinges of pity for Barbara - especially during the luncheon &quot;date&quot; she has with the revolting maths teacher- but Barbara's propensity to look down on everyone and everything makes her a most unattractive personality. The author's skill in developing her characters is  reminiscent of Ruth Rendell at her best; the reader is captured from the first page with a sense of impending doom, and recognizes that there will be no happy ending.	2003-09-12

Hard to believe this isn't a first-rate autobiography - the author perfectly captures the feelings and emotions of an orphaned seven-year old boy. Danny Dorsey is absorbed into his extended Irish family with a few hitches --and with the love of his grandparents and uncles, especially his hero, Uncle Tom. I found myself laughing out loud as well as wiping away tears. The characters and their eccentricities are wonderfully described. Can't wait to read more from this author.	2003-09-06

I found myself putting the book down time after time to ponder the significance of what I was reading. An innocent - regarding the US and its policies--will find his (her)naivety seriously compromised, whereas those of us who have had even the slightest contact with the Company will recognize all too readily the uneasy fact that too much of this novel might be true. Although the novel is huge --daunting to those who find many-paged tomes too hard to undertake - the story is such that once started, the reader must to go to the end to discover the truth --if the &quot;truth&quot; can ever be discerned.  I found this to be a very disturbing book - well-written, with memorable characters - but I did have to wonder if perhaps the author was making the Company out to be worse than it is (or was)  But I didn't wonder much. We have met the enemy, and he is us. A truly remarkable story.	2002-07-06

As someone once said of Henry James, he chewed more than he bit off. Same goes for Carter. Good idea, good characters, good story of a multi-generational, upper-middle class black family --but bad , really bad and boring interjection of a mystery (?) that goes nowhere. Why didn't some Harold Ross type put a stop to the flow? I finished it because I was taken with the family story, but found myself sighing with frustration whenever the author veered off into the mystery tangent. I'm sure Carter will produce better fiction - he has the gift, but he needs to tighten up the narrative.	2002-06-30

No need to go into the details of the book, as others before me have done an admirable job. Not since A Delicate Balance (Rohinton Mistry) have I read a novel set in India (or at least beginning in India!) as engrossing as this. Pran Nath Razdan, the unwitting human sponge, is one of the more memorable characters in recent fiction, and he is surrounded with an equally vivid cast -scheming Indian aristocrats, crusty old Brit soldiers, eccentric missionaries, Oxford blue bloods, African tribesmen - all reflecting upon Pran their own, usually erroneous, certainties.  Who is Pran? He is whoever he needs to be in order to survive, which may well mean he is no one at all. One adventure after another, many hilarious episodes, and the underlying truth that a book cannot be told by its cover - this is a wonderful read!	2002-05-05

Shadows of the horrors which occured hang over the selected three towns he visited even today though the people and the physical settings have changed almost beyond recognition.I found especially interesting the part the American Embassy in Vichy and its employees played during these dark days.A book which increases my knowledge of a time and place and which impels me to do further reading on the subject is one I like to recommend to others.	2002-04-06

Historical fiction is one of my favorite genres as it usually leads to other titles, other authors.  And having an interest in Custer doesn't hurt, either. I liked all of it - the gore, the depictions of inept leaders, the courage of the men who didn't want to be there, didn't want to be doing what they were doing, the absolutely astounding ignorance of the leaders in the East who saw nothing save the red menace and wanted all of them, men, women, children, out of the way.  I agree with the reviewer who said that he wished that Hueber had written earlier novels.  I, for one, will certainly be looking for more from this writer.	2002-03-16

Marital abuse comes in many forms, and in Hall's case, the years of verbal disparagement and icy indifference left no physical scars - but the mental damage to her psyche was profound. The day that turned her life around was the day she glimpsed a figure racing along the water in a rowing shell and, like Paul on the road to Damascus, she was forever changed. What followed was the grueling effort (often surreptitious as well, as her husband did not approve of any activity of hers not related to the house or the children)to become proficient in an extremely demanding sport. That she was 44 at the time did not deter her. That she had to sneak out of the house in the pre-dawn hours to practice, without coach or companion, did not deter her. She knew in her heart and soul and gut that she wanted to do this, and to do it well. As she gained confidence in her abilities, she also found herself strong enough to break away from the suffocating circumstances of her personal life. Both her athletic skills and her growing self-confidence have been achieved at great cost.<BR>     The physical agony of turning oneself into a champion in any sport has rarely been described as well as this. It makes one realize that most of us will never have that defining moment experienced by Hall, and we certainly don't have the mental stamina and will power to arrive at the point where she now finds herself. Her writing is lyrical, tough, funny, and very honest. If she decides to leave the world of rowing, she has a bright literary future.	2002-02-11

Just a daydreamer. And after reading Ruhlman's account of the tortures experienced by the students as the prestigious CIA, I can now let my dreams go in peace. One has to be a sadistical perfectionist to willingly undergo the torments involved in graduating from the Culinary Institute --but it surely makes for great reading. Both this account and Ruhlman's second book, The Soul of a Chef, should be required reading for anyone with the slighest aspirations of going into the food world. Both books read like fast-paced, first-rate novels. It is humbling to realize that I would never make it past the entrance exam --and I consider myself a cook of some distinction! Ruhlman's experiences point out all to clearly that there are &quot;cooks&quot; and there are &quot;chefs', and there is a world of difference between the two.

For those of us who know horses, it is simply a masterpiece. For those who don't, it is an absolutely thrilling account of a time in American history when there were real heros (an heroines), many of them found in the most unlikely places. It is the story of a funny-looking little horse and the triumverate who helped him channel his ferocious heart and tremendous energy into the best racehorse who ever lived. It is a story of the matchless courage and determination of the men and women and the horses they loved. Not merely a biography of a legendary horse, it is also a true and accurate picture of horseracing as it was in its glory days. Hillenbrand captures perfectly the incredible tension of the track; her accounts of the races themselves are so enthralling that the reader could well be one of the screaming thousands in the stands. Suspense at its best. At times both laugh-out-loud hilarious and also heartbreakingly sad, this is a book to own, to inspire, to give as gifts to even the most jaded among us. My only regret is that my parents, life-long lovers of horseracing, are no longer living. How they would have enjoyed this wonderful account of times and places they know so well. Seabiscuit should be on every high school reading list - it is a treat for all ages. It is the first time I have given a book five stars - and I would give it six, if that were possible!	2001-08-03

It is my personal favorite among my many books about food (which are different than cookbooks) Yes, it is surely politically incorrect, but that's the way it was, and we can't change history. Those of us who delight in the wonders of Maryland ccoking and the eccentricities of the Maryland (Baltimore) personality will be higly rewarded. And the recipes are good, too! To quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes, to whom Stieff dedicated his book, \\"Baltimore...the gastronomic metropolitis of the Union...

This is the strangest and zaniest collection of recipes, remedies, survival tips, philosophical musings, diatribes, out-and-out historical flights of fancy --well, I can't describe it. You have to read it to believe it. I first came upon it many years ago, and knew nothing about it (I collect cookbooks and food lore) To put it mildly,I was astonished. Who was this guy? Since then, as some of the other reviewers have done, I have bought several copies for near and dear friends (coincidentally, Minnesotians all) &quot;Sauerbraten was invented by Charlemagne...Henry the VIII actually never amounted to anything and would not have made a good ditchdigger...In 1212 St. Francis went to the Holy Land.

To the uninitiated, her characters are eccentric beyond belief. Not if you have ever lived in Baltimore.  What is wonderful about her novels is that her characters transcend  their setting and gather her admirers all over the literary world.  But she is to Baltimore what William Kennedy is to Albany (although in a more optimistic frame of mind) My favorite novel of hers is Dinner At The Homesick Restaurant, where she captures perfectly the Baltimore persona. Eccentricity is what Baltimore is about, and in this novel (Back When We Were Grownups) as well as almost all of her other works, she captures it perfectly. The emotions the characters experience are universal, but there is a twist to Tyler's works that makes the old Baltimorean smile in recognition.  Hats off to Anne Tyler!	2001-06-26

Frustrating, exhausting, hilarious, challenging - with lots of parts one can gloss right over (of course, there are no doubt some of us who relish the conjugation of Arabic, Icelandic, and Japanese verbs, as well as displaying a profound knowledge of esoteric scientific and mathematical philosophies) But not to worry - it all adds up to a delightful novel about a precocious young boy and his ever-so-bewildered mother and their wonderfully off-kilter relationship.  Ludo is one of the most engaging youngsters to come along in a long time. The style takes some getting used to, but the story (with many very funny bits)moves right along, and the reader is carried along with it.  The reader who gives it up as too eccentric is missing a truly original coming-of-age story.  If nothing else, this novel offers the reader the opportunity to explore all sorts of new and unfamiliar knowledge - and that can't be all bad!	2001-05-12

I didn't put it down until I finished it - then returned it to the library and  couldn't remember the title!

Evocative descriptions of the Polish countryside, memorable characters, old-world values coming up against the modern age,  evil and redemption, and an engrosing story line - this book has it all.

The tension increases chapter by chapter as we watch helplessly as ironic misunderstandings and prejudices bring about an inevitable tragic ending.  The prejudice goes both ways; the Japanese-American seaman has as many skewed views of the Americans he finds on the Georgia Island as they do of him. This is really two stories in one as the writers' colony and the shallow, self-important people who inhabit it are a story unto themselves. The author's vivid descriptions of the Georgia swamplands are actually uncomfortable to read; one starts scratching at imaginary bug-bites while turning pages. The sad fact is that young Hiro Tanaka is not at home anywhere; as a gaijin, or half-breed, he has no place in Japanese society, and the welcome he thought he would find in America - the melting pot - is far from what he had dreamed. Boyle is a gifted writer, and East is East is as good as anything else he has written.	2001-03-27

The(1993)later edition is equally valuable. Although the listings are by necessity subjective and limited, the editor has done a great job of selecting titles that are educational, historic, and just plain fun. Her fiction selections include the better-known mystery titles of many countries, which is a delight for those of us who enjoy getting to know a country through less erudite and more so-called &quot;low-brow&quot; means.

As far as the descriptions of Istanbul and surrounding areas go, Unsworth is right on the mark.  I could close my eyes and know exactly where he was at any given time (Iastanbul hasn't changed much in 100 years) I found the character of Markham rather puzzling - where did he meet his Armenian fiancee,for example? For those few of us interested in Ottoman history and familiar with the polyglot population of Istanbul, this book is a treat.

Unlike much of modern fiction - written to be read in a flash - this wonderful novel requires the reader's attention to every sensory detail. To read it in a rush is to deprive oneself of what the book is all about - the passing of generations, the anguish of loss, the reaffirmation of life, and - above all - the love of the land.  The characters are wonderful, and certain chapters, to counterbalance the undercurrent of loss, are intentionally hilarious.  We have all known some of the people who live in Port William, Kentucky - age does not dimish them. This novel is what American fiction should be - but often isn't.

The superheros are there in abundance - both in the comic books - and what a misnomer the word &quot;comic&quot; is! - and in real life.  This novel could also be considered an education in the early history of the comic book art form - and make no mistake, it is an art form.

To do this absolutely unparalled historical series justice, one must be in a quiet place --read a bit --go away to ruminate on what has been read --and then return for another helping.  Exhausting and exhaustive.  Dame Dunnett is a walking encyclopedia of every aspect of 15th century life.  Our hero (whose name changes throughout the course of the series, and whose unknown parentage is the force that drives him to be what he is) has been everywhere throughout the world in the course of these seven novels, and we have been there with him - from Bruges to France to Germany to Byzantium to Africa to Iceland to Scotland --and places in between.  He is the darling - or the scourge - of almost all of the royal houses of Europe.  It is necessary every once in awhile to refer back to earlier novels to keep all of the characters and incidences straight, and Dame Dunnett's way with commas doesn't make for easy reading, either.  But many readers - myself among them - will be entranced with with the numerous memorable characters along the way.  The history, although confusing, is fine - but we read on to discover what will finally happen to Nicholas and those who love him.  Hard reading, but worth it.  One only hopes that she doesn't really mean to end the series here - there are still questions unanswered, and people whose fate we want to discover. I know that the Lymond Chronicles are supposed to carry us on with the adventures of Nicholas's descendants, but I  first need a long rest!	2000-11-09

The reader becomes involved with the parallel lives of adults and children from the first page of this engrossing novel, set in Shanghai before the Second World War.  The looming specter of the impending conflict casts its shadow over most of the action, but the primary focus is on Christopher and his search for his parents, kidnapped when he was a young boy.  Christopher's self-delusion and self-absorbtion as an adult prevent him from seeing what is real and what is not: his interpretation of events is based on what he knows to be genuine, but proves to be not genuine at all. Mystery unfolds to present yet another mystery, and not until the last few pages does Christopher's unrelenting view of what he &quot;knows&quot; to be true reveal to him that his life so far has been built on mistaken, and tragic, assumptions.  Another winner in this author's body of work.	2000-09-29

He has produced a rip-roaring account of the seige of the  town of Ladysmith during the Boer War of 1899, filled with memorable  characters both fictional and real (Churchill, Ghandi, Buller, Kitchner).   The harrowing account of the suffering of civilians and soldiers during the  seige is unforgettably brought to life.  Although described as a love  story, the romance element plays a secondary role in this gripping  historical novel.  The writer's style may appear to be hit or miss at first  --so many characters, so many differing viewpoints --but the reader comes  to understand that the very uncertainity of the style is a mirror  reflection of the uncertainty of the lives and times of the people  involved.  I thought that the last section, &quot;Monologues of the  Dead&quot;, was a most fitting end for a really good book.	2000-09-05
US	52626504	R116548SKWUKO9	0805062718	200285792	Vacant Possession	Books	4	9	12	N	N	black humor at its best	One doesn't have to have read Martel's previous novel featuring these unsavory characters to enjoy (?) its successor.  What a nasty piece of work is our Muriel Axton!  Admittedly, her horrendous upbringing by a lunatic  mother gives her meager brain sufficient cause to seek sadistic revenge  upon those she sees to be her enemies, but how fortuitous it is that fate  so often cooperates with her!  Martel is positively brilliant at keeping   the convoluted plot going full pace at all times --the reader is never  absolutely certain as to just what will happen, but knows that whatever  does, it will not be pleasant. The mordant wit is most enjoyable to those  of us who appreciate such nice touches! Regardless of the genre she  chooses, Martel is a gifted writer and a pleasure to read.	2000-07-26

Doyle has a wonderful ear for the cadence of Irish speech, a real gift for making his characters come alive on the page, and a story to tell of a remarkable young man who lives the history of  Ireland during its most turbulent times.  His powers of description --of  the grinding poverty of the Dublin slums, especially- are masterful. In  giving us a history lesson, he also tells a tale of betrayal, loyalty,  honor, and love. Roddy Doyle's novels get better with each new arrival, and  there will be many of us awaiting the next volume of this trilogy.	2000-06-24
US	52626504	R2B228707G71Z4	0060196017	715597876	The Doctor	Books	4	5	6	N	N	good story about an intriguing character	A historical novel which sends the reader off in other directions to find even more information about the characters is well worth reading - and such is the case with Duncker's latest effort.  James Miranda Barry is certainly  one of the more curious figures of mid-19th century English life, and  discovering why &quot;he&quot; became what he became makes for a very  enjoyable read.  The supporting  characters (some actual persons, others  creations of the author) are well-drawn and add further color to the story  of the enigmatic doctor.  The author does a fine job in presenting the  contradictions and confinements under which women lived during this time as  well as presenting the issue of slavery as an institution which bound more  than those who were officially enslaved. I would recommend this book to any  who are taken up by well-written historical novels with unusual twists.	2000-06-05

I liked Russell's novel for several reasons. It is an engrossing look into the strange art of the daguerrotype, that phenomenon which swept  America in the early and mid-19th century. It is an entertaining study of  New Orleans, historically accurate or not, during the dreaded Yellow Fever  years. It is a love story with peculiar twists and turns.  But what I  really liked were the ironic discrepancies between the daguerrotypes'  captions, written by some present-day well-meaning art historian, and the  actual truth behind the poses. I found the book to be a pleasure to read.	2000-03-26
US	52626504	R3VQHGTD9W5B4Z	038533401X	186149727	City of Light	Books	4	5	5	N	N	first-rate historical fiction	My idea of a first-rate historical novel is one which educates the reader with facts while entertaining the reader with a good story - learning while being entertained. Very true in the case of this novel. Buffalo - the city  we use as a synonym for horrid winters - is depicted in a different light,  and the author writes vividly of what must have been a most beautiful city.  She has made the topic of electricity one of interest even to those of us  non-scientific types - and instilled a desire to visit Niagra Falls!  Very  enjoyable book.	2000-01-17
US	52626504	R1Q4MFCQCCVEYV	067976397X	659658614	Corelli's Mandolin: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	What a novel should be	This proved to be a thoroughly engrossing, highly entertaining, and often quite moving book.  It is a novel in the old-fashioned sense, not a quick read - and the characters will stay in the reader's mind for a long time.   The ending was a bit of a let-down only in that the two characters involved  didn't act in character.  One of the best books I've read all year.	1999-12-29
US	52626504	RPP9PWAR9IOBD	0374105251	453372686	Another World	Books	4	3	3	N	N	More than just a WWI novel	Years ago I came across Vera Brittain's memoir of growing up in England from 1900 -1925 (Testament of Youth), and had my eyes forever opened as to the horrors of WWI and its impact on the everyday citizen at home.  Pat  Barker's fiction echoed the  horrors of the battlefield in her trilogy (and  Sebastian Faulk does the same in Birdsong)  Barker's latest novel  skillfully runs two parallel courses --a dying old man's all-too-vivid  memories of the Somme, frozen in time, and his middle-aged grandson's  battles with the viciousness and complexity of modern life. As the old man  nears death, the younger man slowly comes to understand the silence which  has surrounded his grandfather's war experiences. True, Barker tells  several stories here - not all with resolutions--but I don't think this  lessens the impact of her work.  Life is often filled with dangling ends,  and some readers prefer to imagine what hasn't been written.  Not as  powerful as her Regeneration trilogy, but a worthy addition to her list of  novels.	1999-06-28
US	52626504	R10P1J1TE80KIO	0060915250	22411719	The Education of a Yankee: An American Memoir	Books	5	1	1	N	N	absolutely delightful account of a most unusual family	For those of us who search for first-rate autobiographies, Mr. Hale has given us a rare gift- a fascinating account of his growing up in a most unusual setting, even by the standards of New England eccentricity. Raised  by loving, extremely wealthy parents who abided by - and built a community  based upon - an ahead-of-its-time Swiss educational philosophy, Mr. Hale  enjoyed a mostly halcyon boyhood which Tom Sawyer would have envied.  There  is a dark side to his life as well, and Hale doesn't shirk from the harsher  realities.  This is a first-rate read  - a genuine piece of Americana by  the editor of Yankee magazine.	1999-01-31
US	52626504	R152MO4MT8D7C6	0395665698	371330467	Damascus Gate	Books	4	1	1	N	N	this book is worth the time it takes to read.	Having just finished Stone's hefty novel and read all the reviews on line, I would like to add my two cents.  Yes, the story is complex, daunting, multi-layered, etc.---but every once in a while, the reader owes it to  him/herself to pick up something that will really test the old brain power.  (Name of the Rose comes to mind, or Incidence of the Fingerpost)  Any novel  that sends the reader off in search of further knowledge is a valuable  addition to the library, and Damascus Gate had me checking the Encyclopedia  of Religions, among other sources, in order to gain a further understanding  of his plot and characters.  Not a book for the beach, nor one which would  welcome interruptions while reading - but one which requires constant  attention to detail, and a willingness to ponder connections.  The author  does not spell it all out for the reader - but mental exercise isn't always  a bad thing!	1998-11-17
