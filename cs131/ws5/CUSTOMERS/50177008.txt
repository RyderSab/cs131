I liked Aztec Blood, what is lacked in writing style is what I expected when I bought the book.  Gary Jennings didn't write the book and therefore, I did not expect an exact copy of his writing style.  This novel was fast paced, fun, certainly unbelievable in most parts, but very good.  Similar to some of Jennings other works, the hero of the story is in constant trouble but continues to avoid the ultimate.  If you have read Aztec and Aztec Autumn, read this.  Like many of Jennings others books, this one continues his assault on the church. I am only sorry that there will be no more from this great author.	2002-12-10

I love Gary Jennings....All his books are great....It is ashame that Raptor and the Journeyer are out of print....Why do you think Raptor is out of print?  My guess is that because is bashes the church constantly....<br />Great story, good history, action and wonderful characters....I would rate this book as Jennings second best after the journeyer.<br />Thorn is a great character, with the only exception being that he can do no wrong.  He never gets caught, severly hurt and appears too lucky in life.....	2002-10-02
