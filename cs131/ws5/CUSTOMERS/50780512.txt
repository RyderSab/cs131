Its arguments are cogent and meticulous. Not only does Mr. Perakh marshall his facts in an organized and cumulatively persuasive fashion, he writes with a simplicity about complex matters that is a literary tour de force in itself. It is the best that can be expected of 2-dimensional thinking on a planar level of (x,y) coordinates of earth existence. <br /> <br />1 star deducted, however. This book lacks the full 3-d volumizing necessary in attempting to grapple with Ultimate Origins in a fully-orbed way. Simply stated, the 'z' axis is missing. In all fairness, Dembski and other IDers picked the playing field as (x,y), so Mr. Perakh is more than happy to frequently outplay them at their own 2-d game, making more than his share of interceptions and recovering many ID fumbles inherent in the 'game-in-the-flat'. <br /> <br />This book more than succeeds as a formidable rebuttal to the ID argument on its own merits and with the parameters pre-established as (x,y) dimensionality. What is lacking is ample consideration of the 'z' factor: either Divine, Alien or Natural Agency as Prime Order Primordial causation/initiator and sustainer of the whole universe we are all trying to seek congenitality for. Hopefully, this author or someone will take on that challenge, getting us off the 2-d chessboard into 3-d chess with some verticality to assess. As long as things are debated on the horizontal level ad infinitum, it will be like Garry Kasparov vs. Deep Blue: sometimes Human ID will prevail, sometimes AI, but it all eventually arrives at: DRAW without due incorporation of the vertical Ultimate Agentivity 'Z' factor.<br /> <br />Full congratulations to the author for a fine book.	2004-09-22

There is a definite evangelistic appeal to readers to consider the claims of Christ and the abundant evidence in Scripture (Primary Order) and nature (Secondary Order) of God's powerful existence. Also evident is the author's sincerity in embracing scientific interpretation of physics data.  <br /> <br />He is Persuaded, but alas not Persuasive in this arena. <br /> <br />String-theory seems to be the flesh and blood of this book's plot. Unfortunately, it is a highly hypothetical, still-in-protoresearch-phase area of physics bordering on metaphysics. It has but scanty observational, scientific-method data and a few creative equations to bolster the rare physicists who consider it even to lie within the bounds of 'True Science'. Unfortunately, the author seems to consider it well within the realm of plausibility, possibility, probability, preponderance. His pronouncements throughout the book give the impression of fait accompli. For him, String-theory is the sine qua non that is the long lost rapprochement and Unification Factor bridging the gap between physics-metaphysics and theology. <br /> <br />And here lies the main troubling aspect of the author's faith opinions: trying to enlist a speculative-at-best physics novelty to unravel knotty theological problems in Christian Doctrines without resorting to the Bible itself first and foremost. His extra-Biblical approach gets him deeper and deeper into hypothetical extra-dimensional realms of imagination. <br /> <br />For those interested in a more thorough rebuttal of the Beyond-the-Cosmos notions postulated here, check the web for the article by William Lane Craig reviewing this book pointing out the manifest errors and mal-interpretations of Scripture. <br /> <br />	2004-08-01

This review refers to the Hugh Ross book BEYOND THE COSMOS.      I was stunned that such a book passed editorial muster at an ostensibly evangelical publishing house. Rarely have I seen such speculative, flagrantly extra-Biblical fabrication in a conservative Christian text.        First, the good news. Many times the author made reference to God's sovereignty, love, creative power and other solidly Biblical attributes. That's commendable. There was a definite evangelistic flavor that tries to win the reader to the faith.    Also, the sincerity of the writer couldn't be clearer. There is no doubt he is Convinced. It's just that he's not particularly convincing. And thus the bad news.        String theory and extra-dimensional existence is barely off the exploratory research chalkboard and taken seriously by a very minute minority in the scientific community. Yet the author treats it almost equivalent to established 'fact' on the level of Relativity Theory, progression of the species from simple to complex, billions of years' dating of the earth, etc. It is not only bad science but bad theology when he claims this novel approach to reality is validated by and validates the Bible with minimal substantiation.        Next, he confuses the reader about the nature, extent and number of these supplemental dimensions. At many points he mentions the regular 4 (3-d space volume+time) plus an extra 6 supposedly discovered, documented (where?) and undeniable. Really, the evidence is too scanty for 10 dimensions. Then he refers to God possibly having one or two extra time dimensions over and above the 10?!?. Then he bounces back to the 10 again. By the end of the book, at least for this non-scientifically trained reader, I'm not sure if he really believes in 10,11 or 12 (or other) dimensions? Since this book was updated/rewritten around 2001, I wonder how string theory, etc. has evolved over the past three years and if he will need to write another book or rewrite this one to keep up with all the proliferation of newly theorized dimensions?        The most troubling parts of this book dealt with trying to integrate these postulatings with the Bible's doctrines such as Atonement, Sovereignty vs. Free Will, Trinity, Miracles, Afterlife. This is where I wonder if the editors assigned to the project bothered to check their Scriptures for support of these farfetched notions. The irony is these contrivances about how God specifically exists and acts in extra-dimensions seem themselves to have come from another dimension of reality! For there is no way of verifying them within our 4 dimensions or the Bible's dimension. The author tries to suggest solutions for Biblical/doctrinal paradoxes using extra-dimensions. But it comes off more like an episode of Twilight Zone or Star Trek than solid scriptural exegesis letting the Bible speak for itself. He is taking the foolish path of trying to answer the unanswerable, unscrew the inscrutible.        One example will suffice (many could be cited and easily refuted Biblically): God's love demonstrated to those in Hell. First, he hardly mentions the extra 6 or 7? dimensions in this section of the book except to state the obvious - the Afterlife goes beyond our 4-D existence. Agreed. Second, he gets the fact of hell being eternal, bodily, conscious, punitive torment correct. That is commendable in a day when so many compromise or water down this hard Bible truth, even among so-called evangelicals.         But the rub is: God, being Love, continues to demonstrate his love for the condemned by limiting the extent and damage of their hellish potential so it's not as horrible as it could possibly be. God's punishment is limited, as it were, for most in Hell so the residents won't be overly oppressed or dominated or abused or subject to the worst someone like Satan himself or a Hitler has to offer.        All any thinking evangelical can say to this sort of contrived theology is: Huh?!? Scripture, please? This is where the editors must have been sound asleep! Nowhere in Scripture does it mention God's love continues toward the condemned. A close look at Revelation, Jude, 2Peter, 2Thess., Romans 1:18ff, Matt.25 (sheep and goats), etc. puts that speculation to rest.        Jn 3:36 'Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; but whoever disobeys the Son shall not see life, for the WRATH of God remains (forever) on him.'        It doesn't get much clearer than that. Unfortunately, the author and his editors must have missed that day in Systematic Theology Class. The other notion of God not letting Hell be as bad as it potentially could be is again sheer speculation from an unknown dimension of imagination.        This book champions a theologizing not found in the dimension of the Bible.It is more akin to String-the-reader-along Theory.	2004-07-31

Most sincere & intelligent. But unwise and unbiblical.<br /><br /> More than 95% of the book uses Scientistic argumentation and citation from physicists, etc.(most are decidedly nonChristian) whose theories provide the whole body of support for Ross' Old Earth interpretism except the skin and hair. That outer covering of 5% of the body of evidence is one short chapter toward the end opining on Old Earthist spin of Creation Workweek and the meaning of day that 'makes most sense'.<br /><br /> What makes sense to Ross is a matter of Epochs, not hours.<br /><br /> Mal-interpretations in his book are too extensive to document in a simple review, but the major ones include:<br /><br /> * Gen.1:1 is given a new twist as PRE-beginning period when 12+billion yrs. of natural galactic evolution produce all stars, sun, moon and raw earth. Thus Ross sets aside 1500BC-1850AD Judeo-Christian understanding of the Bible's first sentence as Preamble (just as 2:1 is Postamble) to Creation Week encompassing ALL cosmos space-time-matter existence. Ross has ONLY planet earth & atmosphere covered by Gen.1:2 on = 4.6billion years of supernatural theovolution.<br /><br /> * Author claims the key to interpreting Gen.1 is Reference Frame, Point of View. Again, contra 3,300+yrs of believers' historic interpretation, Ross pronounces (with scant evidence) Earth's sea level as frame of reference. He doesn't understand that the Holy Spirit is Omnipresent and Omniscient, Whose reference frame is infinite even though He may be immanently at work in His universe. Genesis describes Him hovering over the waters. But the Father & Son(Word = 'Let there be!') - no mention is made of their Reference Frame. Did they leave Heaven and forfeit their Omni-point of view? Only Ross and those inclined to follow his limited reasoning have Gen.1:3 activity described looking Bottom-up vs. Top-down. If Ross is intending to give us a creaturely perspective, unfortunately for his argument NO creatures existed until Day 5, 66% into the First Week. If the Triune God is creating and describing how He did it and how long He took, there is no rationale in the text itself for confining perspective and interpretation of events ONLY to sea-level. An artificial parameter limitation! Throughout Genesis 1 it says- God SAW it was good. Does Ross mean to say ONLY from the bottom-up?? Of course the Almighty's frame of reference is also top-down and any other perspective we can conceive.<br /><br /> * This leads to yet another extra-Biblical speculation. The Holy Spirit 'brooding' over the waters for Ross = breeding, hatching, spawning, seeding, creating micro-organisms for vast geologic ages to develop first life on earth via theovolution. This then coincides with secular origins timetable to 'harmonize' with the Bible. Ross' problem: absolutely NO mention is made of earth life, micro or macro of ANY KIND until Day 3 - plant life, then Day 5 - sea life and bird life.<br /><br /> Conclusion: The LORD says A, but Ross & scientists say B. The LORD does NOT say (x), but Ross' scientism assumes (x) as an unknown that he knows: PRE-beginning stellar & solar system formation 14billion yrs-4.6billion yrs; reference frame is bottom-up ONLY, not OMNI or also Top-down; Holy Spirit hovering over oceans is key to proper perspective, never mind the Father's and Son's - Heaven's point of reference; the Spirit's brooding = breed = generate = nest = hatch = create microlife; 10 dimensions of cosmic existence ??? etc., etc.<br /><br /> 'Are you not in error because you don't know the Scriptures or the power of God?'<br /><br /> 'I warn everyone who reads the words of this book: if anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues (deception, delusion, woes, wrath) described here; if anyone takes aways words from this book, God will take away from him his share in the Tree of Life described here.'<br /><br /> SOLA Scriptura! not scientia et scripturaent NO creatures existed until Day 5, 66% into the First Week.

This is the best book on the subject of how many Christians compromise with worldly scientific theories to interpret God's revelation. It's a dangerous position to be in. Instead of harmonizing the latest 'scientific' theories to God's Word, the Old Earthers are willing to change the Bible's clear meaning of 6 days and a recent Creation to accomodate to secular interpretation of scientific data.<br />Most unfortunate to see critics who are oblivious to attacks on the Bible and the church from WITHIN by Old Earthers like Dr. Ross.<br />When Christians start compromising with secular science the way Ross does in contradiction to the Bible's clear testimony, that is an attack on Scripture. The Word of God should never be subject to human scientific adjudication as to what to believe.<br />Remember, friends. God Himself was there at Creation. The Holy Spirit inspired Moses exactly how and what to write to us. 6 days means 6 days,not Ross' contrived 6 eons or 6 ages or 4.6 billion years, etc. If that's what Moses really meant to convey to the Hebrews and to all Church History up until Darwin's time, he sure went about it in an ambiguous way!<br />Remember, friends. Secular scientists and compromising Christians were NOT there at Creation. Too many believers are second-guessing the Holy Spirit's clear testimony and putting words and re-definitions revisionistically into God's mouth.<br />If the Bible says 6 days = Young Earth and 'science' or Ross says 6 eons/ages = Old Earth, dear readers, whom are you going to believe? The Holy Spirit through Moses or astrophysicist Ross and those willing to change the natural meaning of Genesis?<br />It's required of Christians not only to contend with attacks from outside the Faith, but also from the misguided, sincere-yet sincerely-deceived WITHIN the Faith as well. Genesis must be safeguarded from BOTH attacks. Unfortunately, Ross and his disciples are unwitting combatants AGAINST the Bible's very words in the name of scientific respectability and people's offense at Genesis conflicting with Old Earthism.<br />This book is a fair, balanced, Scriptural defense of Genesis against attacks by well-meaning Christians who go too far to avoid scientific discomfort.<br /> Better scientific discomfort than Bible discomfort! <br />Read John MacArthur's Battle for the Beginning to understand Satan's attack on Genesis: &quot;Did God really say 6 days means 6 days?&quot;	2004-04-14

Inerrancy (error-free Bible) was not really an issue until about a hundred years ago. There have always been squawkers who claim to have found mistakes in the Bible. But only since the late 1800's has this infiltrated into the church in any major way requiring 'Athanasian confutation'. The same could be said for annihilationism, inclusivism (salvation apart from the Gospel being heard/believed), the ramifications of the Atonement(substitutionary, judicial vs. merely exemplary or non-propitiatory), and the heterodox open theoreology of divine ignorance of free-will futures + theo-repentism + God changing as it is beneficial to change + surrendered sovereignty + risk taking vulnerability to failure + other Hartshornian Processism-like ideas (&quot;Trinity and Process&quot;,&quot;Omnipotence &amp; Other Theological Mistakes&quot;).<br />2) While it seems true that the authors do not advocate any one position over another or try to 'convert' anyone to their liberal views, the fact that aberrantly minority views are placed side by side with historically held non-liberal majority confessional teachings with no judgment call gives them equal billing and tacit approval as &quot;no less evangelical, just as valid&quot;<br />3) Some reviewers like lots of options to choose from. It seems so democratic, American and independent to be able to vote for what suits personal preference. What about what the Lord's preference is? See Revelation 2 &amp; 3. How does John the Apostle of Love look on false doctrines/idolatrous notions in his epistles? If only Christians today would read the epistles from the viewpoint of the Lord and the apostolic authors, they would not so cavalierly be open embrace so many differing viewpoints in fundamental areas. Spectrum in this case really means Speculation, Spectral scattering, diffusion of Truth.<br />4) Some think only what is in the Apostles'/Nicene Creeds should be the bounds of what is Essential Truth. But any review of Church history and what Luther, Arminius, Wesley, Knox, Spurgeon, and others had to say about what are Fundamentals will see this is grossly oversimplistic and naive. Aren't the Attributes of God Essential? The Nature of Scripture, Inerrant or not? 100% Verbally Inspired or not? Heaven &amp; Hell - literal, conscious, eternal, bodily or not? The list goes on for thoughtful Christians who know better, or ought to.<br />This book is deceptive to such a degree as to lead many astray as to what is appropriate for Christians to profess.<br />&quot;If you hold to My teachings, you are truly My disciples, and you shall know the Truth and the Truth will set you free.&quot;	2004-03-20

Calvinism is portrayed as one extreme (Too Providential); Openism as the other extreme (not giving ALL relevant Biblical data a chance to speak plainly for itself,i.e. UNbiblicalism). The author is Arminian, so it stands to reason that this view is defended as most biblically authentic.<br />Since there are plenty of books already on the market since Calvin's/Arminius's time debating these evangelical positions, the Devangelical aberrancy of Open Theory will be highlighted that springs from the fertile pens/brains of contempo philosophisticates such as Gregory Boyd, Clark Pinnock, John Sanders.<br />The first fatal flaw of Devangelical Openism is lack of biblical integrity. Texts used by their creative proponents are skewed and lopsided to a reduced Providence, due to reduced Prescience.<br />After all, the very word PRO VIDENCE comes from the Latin for 'seeing beforehand'. Since according to Openists, God cannot see free decisions beforehand because of their non-existence, His Providence is accordingly limited to the past, present and divine projections/forecasts about probabilities of what may or might occur, if all present things remain equal.<br />The second fatal flaw of Devangelical Open Theory is its massive overdependency on Western Philosophy a la Whitehead and Hartshorne. See separate review of Boyd's TRINITY &amp; PROCESS to get an idea of the processistic leanings of Openism. The argument &quot;since Openism is not Process, they have little in common&quot; is BOGUS. An honest evaluation of both Process and Openism (which Boyd tries to do in TRINITY &amp; PROCESS) shows a great deal in common after all. Balanced scholars like Millard Erickson in his WHAT DOES GOD KNOW AND WHEN DOES HE KNOW IT establish the connection quite clearly and undeniably to any fair reader.<br />The third fatal flaw of Devangelical Open Interpretation is a failure to understand how to read the Bible properly and gatherwhat it really says about God's OMNIPRESCIENT CAPABILITY. Just reading the book of Jeremiah dispels any notion of God being ignorant of any aspect of free futures. See Jer.42 leading up to verse 22 when the rebellious remnant seeks to escape to Egypt. God OMNIPRESCIENTLY warns them &quot;Know CERTAINLY that you shall die by the sword, famine, plague in the place where you decide to go to dwell.&quot; God's Providence is clear. God's Prescience is clear. The people's free will and libertarian rebellion is clear.<br />But just as clear is what is missing: any hint at an Openist spin on the text or processistic philosophy take on events.<br />The author does an outstanding rebuttal biblically, common sensically and philosophically that Openism is a failed system. And it just so happens to also be DEVANGELICAL.<br />This book is highly recommended to all Arminian-leaning Bible students (like yours truly) to note the abysmal pitfalls of Open Theory and how it damages any semblance of Providence left in its incoherent, inconsistent, inapprehending system of belief.<br />Jesus said it best about PROVIDENCE, PRESCIENCE &amp; PROPHECY:<br />&quot;AMEN, AMEN, I tell you Peter, the rooster shall not crow till you have denied Me three times.&quot; (John 13:38) Note the double-AMEN in the Greek text!	2004-03-04

The Current Controversy over Divine Foreknowledge	Books	5	102	113	N	N	Open Theoreology's  Post-Mortem: A  Thorough Autopsy	Dr. Erickson has delivered everything the Bible student has come to expect in fair, Scripturally accurate and balanced evaluation of differing belief systems. Here, he dissects Open Theory and determines the cause of demise: contra-biblical infection from the Humanism Philosophistication Virus (overexposure to unbridled, tainted human reasoning with insufficient immunization from Holy Spirit wisdom).<br />The main strength of the book is its faithful adherence to 'All Scripture as written in context interprets each &amp; every Scripture'. Erickson exposes Open Theory as a heterodox philosophy that uses 'Each Scripture as I understand it interprets All Scripture'. This allows Openists to take certain verses, motifs, preferred themes and use them as driving control mechanisms to 'harmonize' troublesome passages/counter-motifs to fit the Open Theory.<br />Erickson makes the excellent and insurmountable case that Openism fails the Presupposition Test: it is flawed from the getgo by having faulty Control Beliefs built in before the Bible is even opened. Which view handles the most Scripture in its natural, author-intended sense relevant to a doctrinal issue (God's Attributes) with the least interpretive legerdemain? Historic Evangelical.Which view extracts selective favorable Scriptures in unnatural, reader-imagined senses fitting the system's philosophic givens with speculative, imaginative, peculiar interpretive circumlocution? Open Theory.<br />With this book,Openism is clearly exposed as DEVANGELICAL.<br />Here is just one example of how Open Theory fails to let the Bible speak for itself without forced Eisegesis (reading into the passage foreign matter the interpreter holds to as non-negotiable givens): Peter's certainly predicted denials.<br />All 4 Gospels have Jesus predicting with 100% certainty Peter's future free denials before the rooster crows the following dawn. Sure enough, Peter denies the Lord 3 times precisely as and when Jesus definitively foretold.<br/>The Historic Evangelical accepts the Scriptures as written and allows Jesus to be 100% Certain in His Omniscient Foreknowledge of Free Futures as Actuality (Definitely This, Definitely Not That).<br />The Open Theory Devangelical rejoinders have all sorts of creative, contorted, convoluted mental gymnastics to escape the plain implications of Jesus' unerring prediction and precise fulfillment without exception. They are forced to argue that the only way Jesus could do this was to arrange it, stage it, orchestrate it to the point of 'squeezing' Peter not just once, or twice, but three times to get him to fulfill the prophecy.<BR>All sorts of psycho-dymanic speculation is posited as to Peter's character being 'solidified' to some irrevocable point as to be manipulatible or predictible. But of course, this goes way beyond the text's simple description of events and violates the Bible's own dictum: Do not go beyond what's written!<br />Here are some penetrating questions for Openists:<br />1)Under equally extreme pressure, Job and Abraham did not deny the Lord, yet Peter did. How could Jesus know this for certain in advance when historic precedent was against it, i.e. improbable?<br />2)Openism holds as a non-negotiable given that God CANNOT KNOW AS CERTAIN future free choices, or else they are not by their definition truly 'free'. Yet Jesus prophesied with CERTAINTY ALL 3 of Peter's future free choices to the most minute detail! Is Openism saying Jesus was not 100% CERTAIN Peter would deny?<br />3)They seem to say Jesus was CERTAIN, but the only way to make it certain was to override Peter's genuine freedom via divine squeezing?!? But isn't this self-contradictory to BOTH allow Jesus to be CERTAIN about someone else's free future AND to deprive that person of genuine free-exercise by arbitrary appeal to 'Override'? Two non-negotiable givens of Openism are thus violated here: NO CERTAIN PRESCIENCE; LIBERTARIAN FREEDOM.<br />4)Peter was actually warned of the outcomein advance. Yet forewarned and forearmed, he still freely denied. How does Openism account for this given their presuppositions?<br />5)Jesus predicted the precise timing of free actions of roosters as well, coinciding with Peter's free actions. How does Openism account for that? Notice the absolute precision of the text: 'Immediately the rooster crowed.''And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.''Peter remembered what the Lord had said.'<BR>Jesus didn't just call it close. He got it exact to the second.<br />6)Openists also overlook the rest of Jesus' prophecy. 'Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.But I have prayed for you that your faith not fail. And when you have returned, strengthen your brothers.' There is all sorts of stuff going on here Openism has zero explanation for under their system: Satan being granted divine permission to sift/test Peter in the denial incidents; Jesus praying and being granted in advance the Father's protection of Peter's faith; Peter's return; Peter strengthening his comrades. Why is Open Theory silent here??<br />7)What about other texts equally as insurmountable for Openism re Precise Predictive Prescience: Abraham &amp; Abimelech (Gen.20:3-7); Gideon &amp; Midianite Dream (Judges 7:10-15); Elisha's Barley Futures (2Kings 7:1-20). Why not a peep in the Openism literature about these passages equally devastating to their theory?<br />Erickson has done genuine Evangelicals a great service by letting the Bible speak for itself and exposing Open Theory as Devangelical heterodoxy for any person willing to fairly evaluate all the evidence. &quot;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&quot;<BR> <BR>Buy 2 books, one for yourself, one for your pastor.

Moving Beyond Pat Answers to the Problem of Suffering	Books	1	100	160	N	N	Boyd uses Bible   inaccurately,   selectively,   biased	Other commenters have touched on major problems with the book and its theories. I will address one concern I had in reading this book carefully. That is: biased,selective use of the Bible to avoid evidence unfavorable to his falsifiable position.<br />Example 1: Boyd cites John 9 with the man born blind as an example of unexplainable tragedy. The trouble is, Boyd has to give us his own PERSONAL unsupported translation of the passage in question to satisfy the demands of his system.<BR>With every version of the Bible I've read, the passage reads, &quot;Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened/he was born blind in order that the work of God be displayed in his life.&quot; Here, to soften the implications and clear statement of Christ as to God allowing the blindness to display the work of God, Boyd claims the original Greek of the passage says,&quot;Let the work of God be displayed in his life.&quot; There, of course, is no footnote or source cited to corroborate such a peculiar opinion. Justification is insufficient to discard the KJV, NKJV, NIV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, Living Bible and most other translations of this passage. Actually, the Greek does not say &quot;Let the work of God be..&quot;, but &quot;in order that the work of God be..&quot; Boyd will have to do better than appeal to his own preference/self-authority to persuade a thinking audience to adopt his novel version. At least, he should get the Greek right!<br />Example 2: Book of Job. Here, Boyd entirely misreads Job from how thousands of years of Judaism and Christianity have read it before. He totally reverses the clear statement of Job &quot;The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away,&quot; as Boyd's version of wrong theology. Because Boyd thinks it's wrong,he superimposes his opinion revisionistically onto the passage to 'prove' his point. In other words, Boyd's reasoning is: &quot;What Job says is what people misbelieved back then. I feel it is wrong theology. Therefore, at the end of Job in Ch.42 when Job repents, he also is repenting of this 'wrong theology'.&quot; Quite a leap to say the least! Again, no citation or reference to supporting scholarship leaves his personal opinion unsubstantiated.<br /> Plus, Boyd deliberately omits the critical verse 2:10 &quot;'Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?' IN ALL THIS, Job DID NOT SIN IN WHAT HE SAID.&quot; The author of Job(God Himself) clearly says Job did not sin in what he said. If Job's theology was wrong as Boyd would have us believe, the author would not have written his remark. The Bible itself is definitive here vs. Boyd's fabricated spin. <br />The question for the reader of Boyd's book is: Who are you gonna believe?? The Holy Spirit or Gregory Boyd? The Bible as it is written, or how Boyd retranslates-revises it to his taste?<br />While the book at times is very engaging and appeals to the emotions with personal stories of tragedy the author has encountered, it is 'semi-Bible-lite' and never, ever mentions the wrath of God against sinners (Ro.1:18ff), and is quick to quote John 3:16, but conveniently bypasses John 3:36 &quot;Whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.&quot; <BR>It would also have been nice to see how Boyd deals with Paul's thorn in the flesh (2Cor.12) where God allows a messenger from Satan to torment the Apostle Paul. Though Paul pleaded with God three times for its removal (which only He could do/allow), God responded with the key to Christian suffering,&quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for My Power is made Perfect in your weakness.&quot;<br />I find this book quite deficient in many respects, but especially on how Boyd mishandles the clear Bible texts to slant things to fit his 'warfare philosophy' of life. The reader is advised to have their Bible close at hand and check it out for oneself like a good Berean to see if what Boyd claims is even remotely close to what &quot;is written&quot;.	2003-10-30

While the Biblical position (God has 0% Uncertainty re free futures,i.e. Unconditionally Sinless) is fairly stated, the book leaves the impression it's o.k. that God may have <100% certainty re free futures (i.e.God is conditionally sinless, He can sin).<br />What this book fails to show from Scripture is that Jesus is OMNI-True(I AM the Way, the Truth..).Christ and all He says is 100% in toto Certifiable Certitude. Yet Sanders' theoreology claims God has been,is,can/will be repeatedly mistaken. Any being that can err, be wrong, hold untruths about the future or be faulty is expressing the capacity to sin.<br />If it could be shown from Scripture that God was EVER wrong, errant, incorrect (even well-intended,perfect motives), then at that point the deity has sinned. When anyone is less than right about anything(predicting future probabilities), he has sinned either by omission (falling short of actuality) or commission (overshooting the mark of Truth). Sanders' view reduces the Creator to creature level.<br />Under Sanders' 'divine riskiness theory', if God forecasts or probabilizes with a measure of uncertainty, we call that a +/-<BR>factor of inaccuracy/deviation or MARGIN OF ERROR. Since SIN by def'n is 'missing the mark','not hitting target','falling short of goal','failure to fully comply','offness','deviation/detour',<BR>'mis-aim', then God must manifest His deity towards us with a self-limiting, relational 'errancy index' or 'fault component'. In other words, a divine 'sin factor' is built into God's relations with us as a given based on the intrinsic uncertainty of our free futures' actual outcomes lining up with His less than certain probabilizing expectancy of all possible options.<br />What's the unintended consequence for Open Theory? Our imperfect<BR>'libertarian freedom' inherently conditions God's divine attributes (His Perfect Libertarian Freedom) such as Knowledge,<br />Power,Will,Judgment,Reasoning,Relationality,Deduction, Foresight<BR>Intuitive skill, etc. with a MARGIN OF ERROR,MISTAKABILITY,<BR>FALLIBILITY,OFFNESS,DEVIATION,FAILURE RATE,i.e. SIN.<br />What Sanders&Boyd&Pinnock&Co. fail to grasp is that our very freedom causes God by definition to knowingly maybe-err while unwittingly(?)maybe-sinning as a result of holding potentially wrong notions/ideas. He is at times NOT vindicated when actual ballots are cast and votes tallied. From Genesis Day One, of all the uncertain probables God has known, how many ultimately prove untrue when known for certain is God's ERROR RATE, batting avg.,Win/Loss record, i.e. SIN CAPACITY INDEX.<br />Sanders' 'Uncertain Futurism' inherently nullifies God's Libertarian Freedom to be UNCONDITIONALLY SINLESS. A RIGHTEOUS Being Whose perfect projections turn out proven false is no longer a Right Being,but a Wrong one.If in fact our freedom'Pre-determines as uncertain'divine foreknowledge of future choices and sets the parameters of What God Can Know and When He Can Know It, Uncertainism finitizes God to creature levels rendering Him a sinner, although a Perfect One. When(not if) God sins as the divine knowledge base proves unfounded in retrospect, He sins Perfectly, however justifiable or rare.<br />Where does that leave the reader of this less-than-certain understanding of Biblical facts?<br />Either Jesus is Unconditionally ALL RIGHT ALL THE TIME or not.<BR>Either God's Libertarian Freedom DOES NOT hamper ours, or ours hampers His. <br />Sanders would have us believe the nature/extent of our Libertarian Freedom entails that God has,is,will and in fact<BR>MUST (can't help but) err, be incorrect at times, i.e. SIN whenever future actualization fails to corroborate God's expectation of probable outcomes.<br />GOD'S CERTAINTY AND RIGHTNESS/WRONGNESS,TRUENESS/FALSENESS IS CONTINGENT ON WHAT OUR FUTURE FREEDOM CONFINES HIM TO, NEGATING GOD'S FREEDOM TO NOT EVER BE PROVEN WRONG OR TO BE UNCONDITIONALLY SINLESS. Sander's deity is Conditionally Sinless<BR>which means Conditionally Sinning.<br />Sanders is trapped by the necessary certainty of Uncertainism: Hindsight proves God's foresight contra-decided when any less probable futures falsify prior divine expectancy as they become borne-out factuals. In the divine mind, Mystery evolves/unveils into History with constant memory updating, intelligence gathering correctives and ever-increasing uncoverage of hitherto unknowables.<br />Mr. Hall is correct. <BR>What does God know? ALL as CERTAIN/CERTAINLY NOT.<br />When does God know it? ALWAYS HAS, ALWAYS WILL.<br />Only this Biblical understanding safeguards the LORD from being identified with error, wrongness, creatureliness,faultiness,<BR>mistakenness, failing, fallibility, uncertainty, falsehood, untruth, i.e. SIN.<br />One star for Mr. Hall's exposition of what the Bible teaches.<BR>Four stars deducted for Mr. Sanders' unbiblical theoreology being posited as an 'alternate view'.It is actually DEVANGELICAL	2003-10-29

Openists cannot bring themselves to admit their theoreology leaves a faultless-thinking deity getting much of the future wrong,being manifestly mistaken about his beliefs re: what will/will not or may/may not happen contrary to divine expectations.<br />But logic says: 'God believed/was fairly sure (x) would occur as not false. Yet (x) did not occur: (x) proved false. Thus God believed false. He was sincerely, surely wrong.'<br />Logic also says: 'God expected perfectly yet uncertainly (x) would occur as not false. Yet (x) did not occur:(x) proved certainly false. Thus God had false expectation. He believed something not in fact the case.'<br />Or as 'risk-takers' would say: 'God plays the odds and wagers on optimum probabilities, but He lost anyway. He wagered wrong.'<br />The openist rejoinder is: God cannot be said to hold false beliefs unless there was erroneous CERTAINTY (x) would occur which didn't. But it's o.k. if the expectation (faith,hope, wager, belief, appraisal, judgment, assessment, projection, forecast) was anything less than 100% CERTAIN.<br />But this is patently BOGUS! It grounds True/Falseness of propositions in the level of confidence(faith-index) of a person, not in the OBJECT of faith per se. Whether someone is 0% or 100% sure of something is beside the point! Only the fact of 'what is to be' counts as to the Truth Value of a held belief. Not the sincerity/certainty of the believer or even the belief itself, but WHAT IS THE FACT OF THE MATTER!<br />We would never think this way of people. If they believe or expect (x) to happen and it doesn't, they're WRONG, no matter how sincere or certain/uncertain. Why would it be any different for God? Because He CAN'T ever be WRONG? Then we're back to Classical, Historic, Biblical-Evangelical position by default!<br />Thank you, Dr. Ware for another excellent expose' of Openism's patent deficiencies.

Interesting that Mr.Pinnock likes dialogs with such aberrant groups like Processists and Liberals.

He can only receive new, novel, ground-breaking, cutting edge stimulation from outside the Historic Christian faith. His trajectory would be more accurately characterized as 'Devangelical'.<br />In his attempt to traverse a crosswalk into frontier territory to find the crossfire, he only stumbles into the crosshairs of anti-evangelical crossbows and the uncharted no-man's land of crosswinds and cross purposes, leaving the Biblical Cross behind	2003-03-24

But this bi-polar beverage has blurred their vision when it comes to reading Scripture and formulating theology. Instead, they have contrived a 'Neo-logy' which is less Biblical and more mormonistic, processismic, liberalistic, evolutionistic with every new book.<br />Credit is given (thus the one lone star!) for being a master of Eisegesis (reading faulty presuppositions into the Bible that are distortive figments of fertile, vain imagination). But without mastery of Exegesis (author-intended drawing out of the supernatural textual meaning via Holy Spirit's inerrant revelation without presuppositional legerdemain), Pinnock gives the reader untraditional bi-polar neo-process contra-biblical false teaching, aberrancy, heterodoxy, heretical inadequacy.	2003-03-21

Much of this book is quite helpful when it sticks to basic Bible truths historically held by genuine Evangelicals regarding the Gospel, Deity of Christ,Justification, Sanctification and so on.<br />But 4 stars deducted for labeling liberal, non-evangelical philosophies/fabrications as 'Across the Spectrum' i.e. within the bounds of Evangelical Historic Christian Faith. <br />Right off the bat, Boyd (a Bapt. Gen'l Conference pastor of Woodland Hills Church and Theol. Prof. at Bethel College) denies his own denomination's Affirmation of Faith regarding Bible Inerrancy. BGC used to require all pastors/professors to uphold and abide by its Affirmation of Faith in all matters.(Will BGC Pres. Sheveland and upcoming Annual Convention enforce their Affirmation by requiring a retraction or resignation from the wayward false-teacher??) But Boyd for upwards of a decade has not only jettisoned much of his denomination's Doctrinal Statements,(see his first book Trinity &amp; PROCESS, liberal,unbiblical non-evangelical philosophtheology that is the fountainhead for all his beliefs/books) but publicly teaches and authors books promoting clearly heterodox, aberrant and liberal (Princeton/Yale variety)neo-Processism theories about God's attributes no longer being literally OMNI in nature; theo-repentism, God 'changing as it is beneficial to change' including the Divine Mind/Will; 'the future doesn't exist until free agents create it for God to know as fact';etc.<br />Where does Boyd get all these ideas? Not from an Inerrant Bible. He believes in 'Limited Infallibility' which is theo-speak for the Bible is error-ridden in matters of science, history, nature, philosophy, biology, geology, etc. It is only 'infallible in matters of faith and practice' according to Boyd (see his Woodland Hills Doctrinal Statement re the Bible). Of course, Boyd does not address in his essay in the book how the Bible can err in matters not relating to faith/practice (things we can see, taste, test, verify), but not err in areas we can't verify. Evangelicals historically have believed the entire Bible relates in one way or another to 'faith &amp; practice', even history, science, nature, etc. If the Word of God can't get the one motif right, how can it get the other one 'without fail'???<br />If God can author the universe by saying, 'Let there be Light!'<BR>Can't the same Author author a flawless Book and get it right?<br />Another problem is Boyd's dismissal of a literal, real, eternal hell for the lost. He speculatively advocates a form of annihilationism or reprieve or some other neutralizing of the full force of the Biblical description. (Why he doesn't advocate making similar neutralizing adjustments to the language for the 'Heaven side of Eternity's coin' makes his position even more dubious and lopsidedly inconsistent.) Boyd claims that the Bible's language for hell is contradictory: 'flames of fire' and 'outer darkness' are &quot;mutually exclusive&quot;. Boyd can't envision how darkness and flames of fire can co-exist simultaneously.<br />But genuine Evangelicals can. Look at aerial news footage of a volcano lava flow or forest fire at night. Pitch dark atmosphere, but glow of deadly, devastating fire in the damage path. Dark and fiery at the same time. Boyd cavalierly dismisses the metaphoric language of Jesus Himself in describing the horrors of a real, literal, burning, outer darkness eternal punishment. That's his privilege. But to call his contrived 'non-literal,non-eternal' hell an evangelical belief is Beyond the Bounds of Christian and academic integrity. Revelation says, &quot;They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever&quot;, &quot;will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb&quot;, &quot;the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever&quot;. If anything, the real darkness,literal fire, endless conscious torment of hell vastly exceeds the limits of inerrant Biblical language to convey. The Bible understates the facts, where Boyd would have us believe it overstates/exaggerates the literal truth.<br />Sorry, Gregory Boyd. We'll stick with Revelation, and what Jesus, John, Peter, Paul, Jude, Isaiah and the Word of God inerrantly declare as fact about eternal conscious punishment.<br />This book is helpful to see just how far some Christians will go to stretch the tent ropes to include all sorts of contra-Biblical modern theories and presuppositions under the label <BR>'evangelical'. But calling a sterile mule or diseased donkey by the name of Stallion does not make it so.<br />If this book is compared to &quot;Beyond the Bounds&quot;, &quot;God's Lesser Glory&quot;, &quot;God Under Fire&quot;, &quot;Bound Only Once&quot;, &quot;Battle for God&quot; and the forthcoming &quot;God's Greater Glory&quot;, Boyd's aberrancy can be clearly documented in detail for the concerned Evangelical.<br />It is dismaying to see how Boyd's processist philosophy lens has blurred his theological teachings into myopic heterodox nearsightedness. He needs a new Optometrist: the Holy Spirit and a Large Print Bible.	2003-03-19

Dr. Ware systematically dismantles Openism by bringing the Bible to bear on Boydism.<br />What are the major aberrancies of Openist Neo-Process Theory?<br />1)Rejection of Inerrant Bible. Boyd's own denomination Bapt. General Conference has as Affirmation of Faith &quot;The Bible is Inerrant&quot;. Yet Boyd in his across-the-boundaryline latest book 'Across the Spectrum' patronizes the Historic Christian position of an error-free Word of God in favor of an error-ridden Scripture in matters not touching on 'faith &amp; practice'.<BR>Ware and the rest of the Evangelical community wonder: just where,and who gets to decide which, Bible matters DON'T touch on matters of 'faith &amp; practice'? Boyd's allegations cast doubt on Bible reliability. It is wondered why BGC Pres. Jerry Sheveland and Bethel College Trustees haven't counseled with Boyd about his anti-BGC Affirmation views (while on the clergy roster and a college prof), asking for retraction or resignation?? Will the BGC annual convention in June side with Boyd or the Bible on this one? The world wonders!<br />2)Rejection of specific Exhaustively Divine Definitive Foreknown Factuality prophecies like Elisha's Barley Futures in 2Kings; Gideon &amp; Midianite Dream Sequence; Zechariah the prophet naming King Josiah 300 years in advance; Peter's triple denial (where Boyd has God 'squeezing' Peter to force 3 denials out of him, unwittingly eviscerating openism's libertarian agency with a divine override!); Jeremiah stating as future factuality that 2 false prophets would meet with a doom so memorable, Judah would quote a curse based on the judgment - Jer.29:21-22.<br />3)Boyd claims the title 'Evangelical' while advocating Neo-Processist ideas like non-literal hell, annihilationism, etc. Boyd claims that the Bible's descriptions of hell as 'outer darkness' and 'flames of fire' are self-contradictory, and can't both be true. Wrong again, Gregory! Aren't there heat energy waves not in the visible light spectrum (ultra-violet, micro-waves, etc.) that can generate tremendous heat energy yet no visible light? Or maybe Boyd hasn't heard of the out-of-body experience of a person who ended up in hell (instead of the usual tunnel of light or paradise). He stood on the shore of a huge lake or sea of flame, but it was dimly lit like zippo-blue-lighter fluid or propane flame emitting hardly any light. He was surrounded by a horrible,inky, suffocating pitch-blackness in the atmosphere all around. Like having it rain and shine at the same time, this man experienced 'outer darkness' and 'flames of lake of fire' simultaneously. Or just think of aerial photos of a forest fire or volcano lava flow at night. All darkness in the sky, with barely a glow of flame. Both at the same time. And both devastatingly real.<BR> All of the Bible's descriptors of hell, while hard for Boyd to imagine, show that the real hell must be infinitely worse than words can incompletely convey.<br />4)Finally, Ware shows how Openism fails the 'Glory Test'. Does the Bible's portrayal of Divine Attributes like Eternal Exhaustively Definitive Foreknown Factuality of free futures reflect Who the True Jesus is? Or Boyd's 'extensive indefinite forecasting' combined with 'infinite chess grandmaster level intelligence', processism's 'theo-repentism', limited quasi-omniscience, surrendered 'pre-creation-omnipotence', finitized pseudo-omnipresence, etc. more accurately depict the Bible's God to fullest magnified Glory? Which Jesus is to be worshiped??<br />He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches!<br />Stay tuned for Ware's forthcoming God of Greater Glory. Also, see the fine 'God Under Fire' and 'Beyond the Bounds' for equally devastating expose's of the misguided, misbegotten, misinterpretive neo-processist heterodox philosophtheology called Open Theory, with its origins in Boyd's doctoral dissertation TRINITY &amp; PROCESS, a hybrid sterile mule mutated from a healthy horse(Historic Christianity)+ diseased donkey(Hartshornian Process Philosophy).<br />&quot;God is greater than our hearts, and He knows EVERYTHING.&quot;<BR>Not 'everything there is to know' or 'everything logically knowable' or 'everything as fact except free futures' or<BR>'pretty much everything' or 'everything our genuine freedom confines Him to' or 'everything possible'. But EVERYTHING. Categorically. Unqualifiedly. Unrestrictedly. Unreservedly. Exhaustively. Free Future Factuality. Limitlessly. Omni-presciently. Without risk of contradiction. Settled in Transcendent Infinity-Eternity as if accomplished fact in Immanent Space-Time (though the Lord may change His stated intentions based on His unstated ones - see Jesus &amp; Philip and the feeding of the 5,000 in John 6:6).  <br />&quot;Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.&quot; (1John 5:21)	2003-03-15

In his most recent book,<BR>'Across the Spectrum', Boyd's essay on 'Infallibilist View'<BR>merely patronizes the Historic Christian teaching and puts forward an Errant Bible for consumption by the undiscerning. For Boyd, 'Infallible' means 'unfailing in matters of faith and practice ONLY', which is contrary to the Dictionary Definition or any understanding of true Evangelical Theology. Why Boyd's own superiors, BGC President Jerry Sheveland or Bethel Trustees don't ask for a retraction or resignation is troublesome when he is in open, published defiance of BGC Affirmation of Faith on Inerrancy of Scripture.<br />One of the best essays in this excellent resource is by D.A.Carson. Here are some excerpts to get a flavor of how Openism is little more than a miscarriage, a stillbirth, an attempt at cloning new illigitimate offspring from Evangelical Theology defective from conception: <br />\\"Toward the beginning of his book God at War, Boyd tells us of Zosia..who in gory cruelty the Nazis (had) blinded. The narration becomes a reason to want to believe God did not know what was going to happen..Because of his ignorance of what would take place, God (could) not prevent its happening.<br />I(Carson) am not persuaded that this theodicy is an adequate defense of God...When God saw the Nazis were about to take out Zosia's eyes (in God's present), why did he not intervene (now that it was no longer an unknowble future choice)? Or if God still wasn't sure what they were going to do, why didn't he intervene after they took out the first eye? If God's goodness and love can only be preserved in the first instance by ascribing ignorance to God, what will protect His goodness and love at this point? Slow reaction times?\\" (Same with the entire Holocaust from 1933-1945: wasn't 12 years enough time for the Almighty, All-Loving to react before the first murdered Jew became 6 Million murder victims?? Boydism breaks down here.) <br />\\"Gregory Boyd acknowledges his indebtedness to process thought in Trinity and Process..Hartshorne's Bi-Polar Theism Towards a Trinitarian Metaphysics..(where Boyd admits)'It is our conviction that the fundamental vision of the process world view especially as espoused by Charles Hartshorne(not even a Christian, certainly no Evangelical) is correct.'\\" Carson goes on to demonstrate how this processismic world view dominates Boyd's understanding of the Bible, with fatal,incoherent consequences.<br />\\"Christian Theology with but rare exceptions (among them 16th cent.

The book of Job, Boyd says,'shows Job's view of God was essentially UNBIBLICAL.\\" Carson cites from Boyd's website chatroom discussion board, noting Boyd missed a key verse in the whole openist argument, \\"In all this, Job DID NOT SIN IN WHAT HE SAID.\\"<br />Carson pegs much of openist argument as \\"at best disingenuous. Certainly openness theorists do not deny (the term) omniscience..but their redefinition is most emphatically NOT in line with Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Wesleyan traditions. It is in line with some Process and Socinian traditions..\\" Openism's problems stem from confusion of Historic Christianity and radical new redefinitions of key terms, muddling the issues and disingenuously deceiving.<br />\\"It is the openness (proponents) who are cut off from the 'great tradition'..and they should be brave enough and candid (instead of underhanded) enough to admit it instead of trying to marginalize (Evangelicals as 'fundies').\\"<br />Buy extra copies and share them with your pastor and friends.

Engagingly written, but serves only as a mask of Boyd's true intention: to claim his personal positions 'Evangelical' while subtly undermining the Genuine, Historic Biblical Doctrines of Christianity.<br />While posing as a 'devil's advocate' of the opposing side on many issues of contemporary Christian Theology, Boyd unwittingly goes too far in his essays revealing his antipathy for the Evangelical position in many cases, especially Inerrancy. He couldn't be more patronizing to true Evangelicals.<br />Cleverly calling his position 'Infallibilist', he violates his own BGC Affirmation of faith at Bethel College (where he is a professor) and his own church Woodland Hills. BGC clearly states in Affirmation of Faith: Bible is INERRANT. But Boyd slyly and short of intellectual integrity writes the essay refuting Inerrancy in favor of an ERRANT BIBLE. He leaves the reader hanging about apparent discrepancies in the account of the \\"70(sic) missionaries\\" in the Gospels. 'Staff or no staff?'<br />Embarrassingly, not only is Boyd himself ironically ERRANT (it was the 12, not 70!), he fails as a serious scholar to admit this issue has been chewed on and resolved satisfactorily by the Reformers and recent real Evangelical scholars like Geisler (When Critics Ask)and John MacArthur's Study Bible (Luke 9:3). Mark says 'take nothing except a staff'; Matt./Luke say 'do not acquire/go get a staff'. Boyd cries, Aha! Mistake! Gotcha!<br />Sorry, Gregory. All Jesus is saying without contradiction is basically, \\"Take along only what you have in hand; if you have your staff, fine. If not, don't go get/buy/procure one. Don't bring anything extra but the sandals on your feet and the clothes on your back.\\" The accounts are most likely composite of several trips or likely Mark is one specific representative trip. All are excerpts. We don't have full transcripts or the whole packing list. Boyd is looking for errors/conflicts when they can readily, plausibly beexplained(since Church Fathers).<BR>Why not give the eyewitnesses who were actually there - and the Holy Spirit Himself - the benefit of the doubt?? Fair enough?? <br />Since he rejects his own BGC denomination's Affirmation on Inerrancy, his presuppositions are showing in his 'devil's advocate' essay.<BR>Why his own denomination President Jerry Sheveland or Bethel trustees don't resolve the matter by Boyd's public, repentant retraction or resignation is not Across the Spectrum, but Beyond the Bounds.<br />This book is Boyd's 'coming out' as clearly NON-Evangelical, aberrant, heterodox, false doctrine, pseudo-theology.<br />However the book is recommended to see how far some who claim Evangelical status have strayed from the Inerrant Word of God.	2003-02-22

They depart from the Word of God and the God of the Word and the True Omniscient/Uncorrectable/Inerrant Jesus with every new Openist publication and pronouncement.<br />2)Establishes clear,undeniable linkage of Open Theory to Charles Hartshorne's Process Philosophy of Bible interpretation (see Hartshorne's 'Omnipotence &amp; Other Theological Mistakes')<BR>Such unbiblical,Process-like worldview permeates Openist filters<BR>and lensing when doing Theology. See also Boyd's seminal Openist<BR>book 'Trinity &amp; Process' where he attempts a synthesis of Scripture+Hartshornism=Aberrant Hybrid Boydism (a la healthy horse+ill donkey=sterile mule).<br />3)Demonstrates Boyd's antipathy to his own denomination's Affirmation of Faith regarding Bible teaching of INERRANCY. Boyd is Theology Prof.at Baptist General Conference's Bethel College. BGC official doctrinal position is INERRANT BIBLE.<br />In Boyd's most recent book 'Across the Spectrum', he categorically denies his own denomination's position with his essay titled 'Infallibilist View'. Boyd doesn't realize the definition of INFALLIBLE is 'incapable of error in any matter'.<BR>Boyd is teaching pastor at Woodland Hills Church. His statement of faith says, 'The Bible is Infallible'. Has anyone checked what he means by it? See his essay in 'Across the Spectrum' p.14-21 to see what Gregory Boyd really believes.<br />Why BGC President Jerry Sheveland and Bethel leadership maintain Boyd on clergy roster/faculty is of concern to many in BGC, who feel integrity would mean resigning in good conscience or public retraction of non-evangelical, Processist teachings that openly defy BGC church and college Affirmation of Faith.<br />4)Marshalling of Biblical evidence that shows how aberrant and beyond-borderline-heterodox many of Boyd's teachings are.<br />WEAKNESSES: minimal. These Scriptures would have been nice additions:<br />John 13:19 &quot;I am telling you now before it happens so that when it does happen you will believe than I am He.&quot; Jesus has Exhaustive Definite/Divine Foreknowledge of ALL free futures. Boyd teaches Extensive Indefinite Forecasting or 'Divine Nescience (Ignorance)' along with 'Theo-Repentism' and 'Infinite Intelligence' in place of Evangelical Infinite Awareness-Knowledge-Omnipresent where/when-there/then in ALL dimensions of space-time (LxWxHxPastxPresentxFuture)<br />Boyd teaches there are Bible errors, using the example of &quot;Jesus' command to his 70(sic)missionaries&quot; about whether to take a staff on their trip. First, Boyd errs: It wasn't the 70, but the 12! Second, a fair reading of the Gospels indicates many mission assignments, each with potentially different itinerary and packing instructions. Luke 22 has Jesus telling them to pack a dagger-knife. Third, one or more accounts may be a composite of several trips while another may be a specific or representative mission. Fourth, this issue has been chewed on since before Augustine's time. Reformers and more recent scholars have put this to bed (see J.Bengel's, Calvin's and Matthew Henry's commentaries as well as Geisler's 'When Critics Ask' and John MacArthur Study Bible notes on Lk.9:3).<BR>Fifth, Jesus was saying: 'carry only what you have with you: sandals on your feet, clothes on your back, staff in hand; don't procure/go get extras or what you don't have now.'(see Greek verbs used for 'take, acquire, procure,obtain,get).<br />Boyd's 'scholarship' and 'fairness' to the apparent discrepancy<BR>is disingenuous and far from humble, to say the least. It's almost as if he can't help BUT to find errors of fact, history,<BR>narrative rather than see the accounts as complementary or excerptive vs. passing judgment 'the three accounts do disagree and thus cannot in any literal sense be labeled inerrant.'-Spectrum p.19 <br />Such is Boyd's aberrant view of Scripture: BEYOND THE BOUNDS of Evangelical, Essential Historic Christian Theology and contrary to his own denomination's Doctrinal Affirmation for Bethel College and all BGC churches, including Woodland Hills.<br />This book does an excellent (almost embarrassing expose') job of unmasking Gregory Boyd, Clark Pinnock, John Sanders and Open Theorists as: Christian? Yes. Evangelical? Sorry, no. Not if one takes their public false-teachings and books at face value.<BR>They are certainly free to hold their beliefs. But self-proclaiming they are Evangelical and fomenting openly or subtly for 'change from within' is shown to be an empty claim and lacking integrity. Process theorists don't claim to be Evangelical. Why should Neo-processist theorists?<br />&quot;By their fruit you shall know them..Test the spirits..Dear children, keep yourselves from idols..Scripture cannot be broken..do not go beyond what is written..are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?&quot;<br />Buy extra copies and give them to friends &amp; pastors and start group studies about Who the Real Triune God and His nature and attributes are.

This book would have rated 5 stars if it included only Chapters 2,3,8-10,12,18,23,26-29. It is especially 5* in dealing with the Gospel, Salvation, Sanctification and Christ's death & resurrection. When it sticks to the basics of the Gospel, few recent introductory apologetic books are its equal. The fact that the skeptic was led to Christ by the sheer power of the Gospel is cause for rejoicing.<br />But 4 stars are deducted because of the troublesome chapters 1,4-7,11,13-17,19-22,24-25. That's almost 60% of the book! The problems stem from the author's first book, Trinity & Process, with its distinctively Liberal Processistic Philosophy approach to understanding Jesus and the Bible. These neo-liberal, non-evangelical presuppositions (interpretive filters) permeate the author's worldview and cast many doubts about crucial matters like an Inerrant Bible without mistakes, the Nature and Attributes of God, how to interpret key Bible passages, the afterlife, the nature of the Future and God's knowledge of it, and how evil plays itself out in a Good God's world. The author gets these critical areas almost 100% wrong,heterodox,aberrant.<br />This book, therefore, cannot be recommended as an apologetic resource. It simply compromises Bible truth too flagrantly, often very subtly, and so thoroughly that one never knows from chapter to chapter, page to page, topic to topic, where the author will speculate next with 'my own view is...' or 'I feel strongly that...' or 'my God is like...' or 'I don't think...<br />Don't take this reviewer's word for it. Here are some quotes:<br />'When I first became a Christian..I had gotten myself in some sort of..cult..(later) my Christianity became more mature and less 'cultic' and narrow-minded.\\"<br />(Reply) 'I often wondered how you could continue to believe this Christianity business in spite of the rather liberal institutions (B.A.Philosophy-U.Minn;M.Div-Yale;Ph.D-Princeton)<BR>you've attended.'<br />'until we make (decisions)they don't exist. In my view at least, there simply isn't anything to know until we make it there to know. So God can't foreknow the..decisions of people until..they create their decisions. This isn't the traditional Christian position(which)I think is philosophically untenable.'<br />(Reply) 'It seems like your view of God is much more 'human' than what I've always thought God was supposed to be..I wonder if your view is just your own creation.' (Good point!)<br />'these beings(are)'angels'..but I don't want you to get the idea of winged,white harp players..There's nothing in the Bible about such silly notions.' (What about Revelation 4:8,5:8??)<br />'Is my God all-powerful? I want to answer yes and no..with the creation of free creatures, I maintain, God necessarily surrendered a degree of His power..It is utterly impossible for God to be always in control and yet allow free beings to exercise some control.Thus to the extend God 'lends' power away, He no longer utilizes it..in my view God is in essence all-powerful, though He now chooses not to be.' (Huh??)<br />When you read an apologetics book by D.James Kennedy, Josh McDowell, Chuck Smith, Bill Bright, Chuck Swindoll, Hank Hanegraaff, Chuck Colson, Norm Geisler, there is zero concern about whether fundamental doctrines of Christianity will be upended, however subtly or flagrantly. No Holy Ghost alarm bells go off.<br />But with Boyd's book, red flags and klaxons go off almost every other chapter (except Ch.26-29 which are actually quite good).<BR>The book claims to defend the faith. But which 'faith'?<br />Like week-old brownies laced with harmful substances, so is this book with enough Gospel to be nourishing, but too much foreign matter (novel ingredients, egg-shells, bacteria) to be passed over for fresher, healthier, safer 'soul food'.	2003-02-12

This is what the Lord Almighty says about Ahab and Zedekiah who are prophesying lies to you in My Name. 'I will hand them over to King Neb. and he will put them to death before your very eyes. Because of them, all the exiles from Judah in Babylon will use this curse: The Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.'\\"<br />An irrefutable case of EXHAUSTIVE DEFINITIVE DIVINE FOREKNOWN FACTUALITY about the future free decisions of Ahab; Zedekiah; King of Babylon specifically using fire for execution; and all exiles using the exact, precisely predicted curse based on the free decisions of Ahab, Zedekiah, King (all inextricably interlinked) in the OMNI-Mind of God, freely played out in time <br />Openism's 'extensive indefinite forecasting' cannot account for such prophecies. (Too many to list here - see separate reviews for 'Beyond the Bounds'; 'God Under Fire'; 'Bound Only Once'.) <br />Why must Gregory Boyd set up a hyper-Calvinist view as straw antagonist, then make his 'case' for why his Open Theory is the 'most Biblical' (compared to what??)? Ajarism (Free Futures are seen by God as through an ajar door darkly) can't help but seem more palatable by comparison with the ultra-Calvinist <BR>'Closed door known but to God' or Liberal Process 'Wide-Open door unknown to God'.<br />The nebulous argument for 'Infinite Intelligence' to compensate for 'Non-infinite knowledge of free futures' (known as Divine Nescience,i.e Ignorance) is verbal legerdemain for denial of genuine, meaningful OMNI-science as the Bible teaches. <br />God is, according to Boydian theory, MULTI-scient or MAXIMI-scient (God knows a lot, more than anyone, the maximum logically knowable, but not quite EVERYTHING as the Bible says).<br />Instead, Gregory makes God out to be of such great intellect to work around His deemed lack of Infinite Foreknowledge of all future mortal free Shalls and Shall nots, Wills and Will nots. Boyd invents a new sub-Attribute to compensate for eviscerating another Attribute to allow God to come out O.K. in the end.<br />But it backfires. It only creates a deity in a limited human's intellectual image. In exchange for the Biblical Jesus of Infinite awareness, foresight, prescience and precise knowledge of all Space-Time events/decisions from Eternity Past to Eternity Future and all in between, we are left with a supreme weather forecaster or chess grandmaster. However as we all know, weathermen are often surprised, wrong, erroneous and mistaken. Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue have both lost against each other. Is this the sort of Jesus that Gregory Boyd sincerely believes in, trying to persuade others to accept,too?<br />'Infinite Intelligence' is woeful consolation for 'knowing' free agent futures as predominantly possibles, maybes, contingents, risky what-ifs, potentials, probables, likelihoods,<BR>projections, indeterminates, variables, random chance, unpredictabilities, uncertainties that may after all not materialize to divine expectations/forecasts. <br />It is here that the equally nebulous Boydian concept of 'Theo-Repentism' must be triggered to explain how Jesus handles free futures that don't work out as anticipated. When confronted with new information, or in relating to free decision makers, the Eternal Lord Jesus then changes the divine mind, repents (of wrong-doing, wrong-guessing,wrong-imagining, wrong-thinking,wrong-prognosticating, wrong-speaking,wrong-predicting, wrong-prophesying, etc.) or regrets, rues prior decisions based on incomplete data, wishing they could be do-overs or in need of retraction or repair. Infinite Intelligence kicks in at this stage for 'divine damage control' to salvage a draw and prevent checkmate from all the free-ranging opponents who act/decide contrary to the limits of divine predictability in the chaotic chessgame/meteorology of life.<br />Sound puzzling? It is. Especially when you read the seminal book by Gregory Boyd that started it all: 'Trinity & Process' (see separate review), based on Hartshorne's 'Omnipotence & Other Theological Mistakes' (see review where you discover that Boyd's Omnipotence is no less limited than his Omniscience). <br />It seems OMNI (Latin for All) cannot mean OMNI anymore, at least for Open Theorists. What then becomes of OMNI-presence? Infiniteness? Eternality?<BR>Transcendence? OMNI-sapience (ALL-Wise)? What happens to all the Historic-Evangelically understood Trinitarian Attributes? How are they Openistly redefined/updated for modern consumption? Only God knows (or, maybe He doesn't? Stay tuned!)<br />Most unfortunate that books like this which incorporate non-evangelical 'theology' alongside historic Christianity are distributed for uncritical consumption by a non-discerning readership. Seeking wider respectability, Openism/Ajar Theory merely shows with every published page how far Boyd-Pinnock-Sanders have headed AWAY from the Bible and TOWARD a vivid, free agent imagination a la borrowed elements of Hartshorne's Processistic, non-Scriptural philosophic fabrications.<br />The LORD said it best in Job 42:7 \\"I am angry with you..because you have not spoken of Me what is right.\\"<br />This book rates 3 stars for including 3 Biblical/Evangelical views, but subtract stars for Gregory's use of contemporary philosophic presuppositions applied to selective misinterpreted Bible texts to provide a marginal audience the latest heterodox option to counter the straw antagonist of hyper-Calvinism. <br />Ultimately can't persuade in any cogent, balanced, unbiased way.<br />The OMNITrue One Who has Eternal Exhaustively Divine Definitive Foreknown Factuality of ALL Free Futures, Infinitely Uninformable ,Unrepentable,Inerrant, Incorrectible, Infallible, OMNI-Present (Ever-Present I AM in ALL point-moments of space-time: Length-Width-Height-Past-Present-Future), Eternal, Limitlessly Aware,OMNI-Relational,Interactive LORD Jesus said,<br />\\"Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?\\"	2003-02-08

God 'voluntarily' surrendered His absolute authority/control/<BR>say-so in order to properly relate to free creatures. In Boyd's mind, there could be no other way (Boyd seriously misunderstands the concept of 'delegated dominion'- whereby God loses/surrenders ZERO- and massively reduces God's Sovereignty/Omnipotence/Authority in favor of 'ultra-libertarian agency'). The results are warped,skewed, bizarre. <br />Why must the author always set up a hyper-Calvinist view (which hardly any contemporary published evangelical authors or their audiences embrace)<BR>as straw antagonist, then make his case for why his open theory/warfare theodicy is the most Biblical? It can't help but seem more palatable by comparison (at least to Openness fans).<br />For once, we would like to see from this author and his admirers a thorough understanding of the position held by Arminius and Wesley as to Christ's Divine Attributes, Eternally Exhaustive Divine Definitive Foreknown Factuality of All Free futures, Human Freedom/Will, God & Evil, a literal hell as Jesus and Revelation 14 & 20 clearly describe in graphic detail, and a grasp of God's Infinite Wisdom/Knowledge/Awareness of all free futures as DEFINITELY THIS AND DEFINITELY NOT THAT.<br />The argument for 'Infinite Intelligence' to compensate for 'Non-infinite Knowledge of free futures' - i.e. Divine Nescience - is merely semantic evasion of the denial of Omniscience. It is now no longer OMNI-knowhow, but MULTI- or PENULTIMI-science. Almost, but not quite what it used to be. The author makes God out to be smart enough (a divine upgrade) to work around His lack of Exhaustive Definite Foreknowledge (deficiency). But this only makes the Deity out to be a supreme weather forecaster or chess grandmaster, very humanistic indeed and a phantom upgrade. 'Infinite Intelligence' is woeful consolation for 'knowing' free agent futures as predominantly open possibles, maybes, contingents, risky what-ifs, potentials, perhapses, probables, likelihoods, uncertainties that may after all not materialize to divine expectations/forecast for which the open theory 'infinite intelligence' must kick in to do damage control and salvage a draw to prevent checkmate from all the free acting opponents in the chaotic chessgame of life.<br />Sound puzzling? It is. Even supporters have difficulty tracking the weather patterns of this sort of speculative 'theology'. We suspect it will take several more iterations/upgrades before the author begins to more fully grasp the implications of where all this is heading: AWAY from the Bible and TOWARD a vivid human imagination.

Spectrum, 4 Views/Divine Foreknowledge), it is necessary to read this book.<BR> Its primary source is Charles Hartshorne's philosophy which Boyd integrates into his personal theology, sort of a quasi-processistic presupposition that permeates his non-historic thinking. It demonstrates as others have done that Boyd fails to grasp not only Historical Evangelical Theology (not some ultra-Calvinistic strain he seems to be recoiling from and setting up as straw-antagonist), but also the implications of tampering with several of the Attributes of God. Tweaking one or two (Omnipotence to Boyd is more Multipotence, Principotence, not unqualifiedly OMNI; Omniscience is only what Boyd can grasp of that portion of the future said to exist presently based on current factors, NOT what free-agents may or may not decide), tweaks all (Omnipresence, Infinity, Eternality, Holiness, Goodness, Aseity,<BR>Transcendence-Immanence, Sovereignty, Perfection, Omnisapience, etc.)<br />Thank you D.A. Carson, Norm Geisler, Hank Hanegraaff, John MacArthur, Millard Erickson for politely, yet almost embarrassingly showing Boyd's aberrations for what they are:<BR>UNBIBLICAL, Quasi-Bi-Polar Processistic Philosophizing while in graduate school.<br />May Greg Boyd be 'open' to plenary Scriptural witness about the Real Jesus and true Trinitarian Divine Attributes.

Just one Scripture from Jesus settles the Foreknowledge Issue once for all:<br />\\"I AM TELLING YOU NOW BEFORE IT HAPPENS SO THAT WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN YOU WILL BELIEVE THAT I AM HE.\\" (John 13:19)<BR>Not forecasting, possibilizing, but TELLING. Not if, but WHEN.<BR>Not may,might,could,perhaps should, but DOES happen. 0% Uncertain. 100% definite. That's genuine Omniscience. Amen.<br />Interesting that this book would present as one of the \\"evangelical\\" options of what God knows and when He can know it:<BR>the curious notion that God possesses EXTENSIVE INDEFINITE FORECASTING (a la weather prognosticator or chess grandmaster) subject to all the iffiness and unknowable randomness of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and Chaos Theory working themselves out in a fallen world unbeknownst in advance to the Creator! Boyd's presupposition is THE FUTURE DOES NOT EXIST YET, EVEN FOR THE OMNISCIENT/ETERNAL CREATOR GOD, except as mere possibilities yet to be freely actualized.<BR>Therefore He is the deity of what is humanly,logically possible.<br />Boyd's Neo-Processistic philosophical theorizing becomes more incoherent with each book. How can God know how He will definitely act in the future if He doesn't know how sinners and demons will definitely behave? If our decisions don't exist until we freely make them, how can God's decisions exist until He freely makes His in response to ours in response to others in response to the devil's in response to... ad infinitum?? If all God can know are ultimately possibles (not actuals, definites), then ALL He can know about future agency is INDEFINITE (MAYBE). Thus Boyd teaches EXTENSIVE INDEFINITE FORECASTING - which he calls Omniscience! Talk about verbal legerdemain! God can only know what is humanly,finitely knowable<br />A careful study of the Bible shows rather the truth that there is NO LIMIT to the extent (past,present,future) of God's knowledge. It is ETERNALLY EXHAUSTIVE DIVINE DEFINITIVE FOREKNOWN FACTUALITY OF ALL FREE FUTURES-OMNIPRESCIENCE <BR>His understanding is INFINITE. That God definitely knows in advance precisely what sinners and demons WILL/WILL NOT do doesn't mean therefore that they are thus forced to, or thereby lose their agency/moral responsibility. Neither is God to blame for the foreknown exercise of their agency. He retains full final say, ultimate control and awareness as definite in advance of ALL they will choose to do. Because some mortal minds can't reconcile this profundity, Open Theory (Ajarism) is the misbegotten result. With all due respect to sincere but sincerely wrong Gregory Boyd, there is little about Neo-processism or EIF (EXTENSIVE INDEFINITE FORECASTING) that can be understood in any sense as Biblical or Orthodox Truth about God's Attributes such as OMNISCIENCE/OMNIPRESENCE. God is ever PRESENT at every point/moment of space/time, including ALL the FUTURE. The I AM is ALREADY THERE/THEN waiting for us just as He IS with us HERE/NOW.<br />Otherwise well-written. 1 star for attempting to resurrect the long-discredited 'Nescience' pseudo-theology of the late 19th Century (with some elements of 16th Cent. Socinianism) via a self-refuting misunderstanding of how God interacts with ALL FUTURE MORTAL AGENCY: Comprehensively, and for Open Theorists, Incomprehendible.	2003-01-24

For the undiscerning, the danger is in embracing heterodox opinions all in the rage among so-called evangelical theorists. One opinion is posited as no better than another, as long as we love and tolerate each other and widen the 'evangelical tent'.<br />Bizarre doctrines like annihilationism (the Jehovah's Witness' non-literal Hell, which inanely downgrades one side of the Eternal Coin not realizing the automatic downgrade on the Heaven side of the same coin!)<BR>and Open Theory of Bible Interpretation and its presumptuous and preposterous pontificating of &quot;Theo-repentism&quot; and &quot;Divine Nescience&quot; are just a few of the major problems with such books.<br />While the authors try to make a readable showcase of all the varying points of view, by not taking a stand or being clearly Pro-Scriptural or Anti-Scriptural on major doctrines, the novice and the undiscerning are left to flounder and shipwreck on the reefs of aberrancy.<br />The issue is not &quot;understanding issues in evangelical theology&quot;;<BR>the issue is Understanding Scripture and letting it define what Evangelical is.  Much of the material in this volume is beyond the pale of Evangelical without being clearly identified as such. It unfortunately acts as a platform for the &quot;new vs. true&quot; tendency by many seekers after new winds of doctrine. It emboldens many to keep stretching the envelope until it overflows or bursts, unable to hold anything.<br />As long as 'evangelical' can encompass the spectrum of heterodox aberrations of Open Theory as espoused by Pinnock, Boyd, et al, denying a literal Hell as taught clearly by Christ, and redefining the Attributes of God, we end up with a different 'christ' and render the term 'evangelical' devoid of Biblical distinction.<br />One star is one too many. Better is Millard Erickson's Christian Theology which does a far superior job of comparing the various positions of doctrinal issues and comes down clearly and Biblically on TRUTH, not speculation and iffy indecision, leaving the reader to guesswork or conjecture and at risk from the cults and the slippery slope toward heresy.	2002-05-22

But good intentions for daily Scripture time or to read the Bible<BR>through each year often fail due to lack of a plan,<BR>schedule, daily menu for regular Scripture intake.<br />This wonderful Bible solves the problem by breaking down the entire Word of God into bite-sized daily meals for the soul to easily digest during our busy schedules. A balanced blending of Old and New Testament readings each day makes the goal of daily disciplined reading much easier and achievable.<br />There is a great sense of accomplishment to make daily progress and get more deeply acquainted with the God of the Word Who longs to show Himself to us day by day. Even if we miss a day or two, the task of catch-up is not hopeless: just pick up where we left off and begin again one step at a time. No pressure, no guilt.<br />Makes a wonderful gift for friends and seekers to achieve what for many is a daunting challenge: to read the entire Bible at least once in one's lifetime. This makes it a pleasure to read it through each year and have our lives transformed, one day at a time!	2002-01-28

It is a model, a framework of what proper, God pleasing prayer is all about.<br />Prayer is not merely about us and our needs of the moment; it is about HIM and HIS WILL. Hank makes the point that the Lord's Prayer starts and ends with God in Heaven, His Kingdom and Glory<BR>and that the purpose of all Christ-honoring prayer is to maximize the glory of the Lord by what we pray, how we pray, the faith/hope we bring to prayer, our expectancy, and how serious we take the two critical factors that end every biblical prayer:<BR>&quot;In Jesus' Name&quot; and &quot;Amen&quot;.<br />Prayer is RELATIONSHIP, not just realization of our needs/wants.<BR>&quot;Our Father&quot; sets the tone for what true prayer is all about.<BR>Hank does a great job in showing that our walk with Christ determines Who our true Father is and how the mutual love relationship plays itself out in the Family of God. It's not what we can get out of God that counts, but what He can get into us of His Spirit and being filled with His love and presence.<BR>It's 'Presence' over 'Presents'.<br />Finally, this book is a great corrective to many misunderstood<BR>beliefs about Prayer of Jabez, for example, which many folks try to use as a formula for blessing rather than a template of a godly life lived in proper relationship with the One we pray to.<BR>While God is more eager to bless/grant prayers than we are inclined to ask, we still need to ask aright,putting first things first: Our Father must come first and His will prevail.<BR>Why would we want to receive any less than God's best for us?<br />This book will literally revolutionize your prayer life. When we prayerfully draw closer to Abba Father, becoming more Christ-like<BR>in the process of a life of prayer, we are filled with the Spirit<BR>and find more of our prayers answered as conforming more and more<BR>to His perfect will. When we receive more of the Giver Himself,<BR>the gifts/blessings come along as added benefits, but if we focus on the gifts/blessings, we lose out on deeper communion/<BR>intimacy with the Giver, the Lover of our souls. <br />Makes an excellent gift and is one of those rare books that should be read multiple times in a year for maximum blessing!	2002-01-27

His insight on the poet Hardy as well as monumental poems like<BR>'Darkling Thrush' and 'Convergence of the Twain' are illuminating,<BR>penetrating and vividly insightful. Brodsky's prose itself at times soars into poetry in motion and emotion as his genuine delight in Hardy's craftsmanship constantly bubbles to the surface of his introductory essay.<br />It's clear Brodsky and his hero Hardy have much in common: earthy;master noticers;poets of the suffering human condition;<BR>a keen appreciation of what most eyes miss combined with a gift<BR>of expressing that vision in ways that stick in mind and heart<BR>for the duration;an understanding of 'cunning irregularity' in their mostly formal prosody, that is, not being too sing-songy or<BR>doggerelish in rhyme/rhythm of their lines, but utilizing built-in 'speed bumps' to vary the tone and texture of their poems.<br />A tour de force that belongs on every poetry-lover's shelf next to their volumes of Hardy,Frost,Yeats,Housman,Masefield,Auden,<BR>C.S.Lewis,Betjeman,Wilbur,Hecht and younger poets Timothy Steele,Dana Gioia,A.E.Stallings.

While not wanting to be misread any more than other authors, he enjoyed playing some poetic pranks on unsuspecting,naive readers who don't pay attention to his irony,double-entendre,gentle spoofing,and<BR>tricksterish legerdemain, all in good fun of course. Those readers choosing to read him straightforwardly on a superficial <BR>level will often find they are reading the opposite of what Frost intended. But in most cases, we'll simply never know just exactly what he intended, since he left that to the reader to figure out.<br />The author does a commendable job of showing us how to be more <BR>'Frost-wise' in our reading of his masterworks. Of his 345 poems in the collected edition, Randall Jarrell said 1/3 are dispensable; 1/3 are eminently readable,even repeatedly, holding many surprises that reward further exploration over the years;<BR>and the rest (115 or so of the anthologized masterpieces) are ones worth dog-earing,memorizing,recitation,meditation,intensive<BR>study and lifelong plumbing to even begin to approach their depths as works of art of the highest calibre in modern times.<br />Frost's ingestion of the Bible,Shakespeare,Greek/Roman Classics in youth/college were his fount-fillers,providing the raw material and potential to be unleashed with power in his poetry.<BR>First published in 1913 when nearly 40,living in England, his work would continue to crescendo until age 89,garnering an <BR>unprecedented 4 Pulitzers and President Kennedy's Inaugurational reading.<br />This book is indispensable for mastering the work of the master.<BR>Read in conjunction with Timothy Steele's 'All the Fun's in How <BR>You Say a Thing', and Richard Wilbur's essays and poetry, will enhance the appreciation of Frost's genius and make better readers of us all.	2002-01-16

Thus, <BR>their Omni-science is reduced to Multi-science: knowing much, but not ALL.<br />Geisler does an outstanding job of exposing Open Theory's failure on all levels. Why he calls his book BATTLE FOR GOD is that it literally is a battle for Who the Real Jesus is. <BR>The Neo-Socinian/Process/Bi-Polar Theism claims that Classical,<BR>Historical/Mono-Polar Theism is the inheritor of a conception of<BR>Jesus Christ that is more man-made than biblically revealed,<BR>more philosophically fabricated than exegetically determined,<BR>misinterprets anthropomorphism as non-literal analogous language<BR>to humanly describe the Lord, guilty of hermeneutical malpractice<BR>misrepresents Christ -all of these serious charges leveled by <BR>Open Theorists such as John Sanders,Greg Boyd and Pinnock against the position of Athanasius,Augustine,Hus,<BR>Wycliff,Luther,Erasmus,Melanchthon,Calvin,Knox,Arminius,Wesley,<BR>Spurgeon,C.S.Lewis,etc. cut both ways.<br />Someone's claims are invalid.

This book is no exception.<BR>With just a few statements, he shows how his position is most <BR>moved toward an almost Mormon position of a being who is not necessarily a pure spirit being, i.e. possibly embodied.<br />The best review of this book would be a few excerpts from Norm<BR>Geisler's critique of Neo-Processistic/Bi-Polarish Neotheism,<BR>called BATTLE FOR GOD (see separate review);<br />Direct quotes from Pinnock's Most Moved Mover:<br />&quot;If He is with us in the world, if we are to take biblical metaphors seriously,is God in some way embodied?&quot;<br />&quot;Is there perhaps something in God that corresponds with embodiment?

Pinnock also points out that Jesus was wrong in some things He predicted.<br />Summarizing Pinnock's book is reminiscent of the adage that heterodoxy does not so much need refutation as a clear exposure and revealing of its patent falsehood and obvious flagrancy.<BR>After reading Most Moved Mover (and Pinnock's recent Evangel.<BR>Theol.Society essay referencing God 'actualizing his Temporal Pole in the divine nature') advocating that God may have a body,<BR>the Bible is mistaken in numerous places and Jesus erred (i.e.<BR>sinned), we feel compelled to say simply 'We rest our case'.<br />'Most Moved Mover' begs to be compared with Geisler's 'Battle  <BR>For God'.

It is characteristic of love to be Self-Emptying and the Incarnation reveals how God likes to use His power,not to dominate,but to love. In creating,there was Self-Emptying of Omnipotence (see Hartshorne's book above). There is also Self-Emptying of Eternity. By bringing into being a Temporal creation whose nature is expressed sequentially as unfolding history,the Creator granted reality to Time and ACTUALIZED IN HIS DIVINE NATURE A TEMPORAL POLE such that He knows things as they really are temporally in succession. There must be in God BOTH THAT WHICH IS WHOLLY FREE FROM VARIATION BUT ALSO THAT WHICH CORRESPONDS TO VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES OF A TEMPORAL universe. INCARNATION INVOLVES SO DRASTIC AN INVOLVEMENT WITH TEMPORAL reality we conclude Time is not foreign to Divine Self-Emptying Nature.<br />This is enough of an idea from Pinnock's recent public teaching to conclude:1)It is unashamedly BI-POLAR as a theology,jettisoning the Biblical concept of MONO-POLAR Theism. Pinnock even used the processistic buzzwords of'actualized in his divine nature a Temporal Pole', and God is 'both free from variation and varies with varying circumstances',i.e.poles of changing and non-changing. The free-will deity is Bi-Polar in regards to divine attributes,thus double/dual/binary poles/terminals/loci/foci/cores of reality/nature/being/existence/relationality - straight from the Process Playbook as this book abundantly shows him in dialog with Process Theists.2)It's fine to emphasize the Incarnation of the Second Person of the Trinity,since that's the core of Scripture/Christianity.However,to violate Paul's dictum of \\"Do not go beyond what is written!\\" is to transgress Evangelical Boundaries into illegitimate territory:neo-Processistic Bi-Polarism. For Pinnock to conclude that since Christ became incarnate (remember this was a miraculous 33-year manifestation of Son of God on earth in human flesh to accomplish the sin bearing mission) means a continual/permanent norm of Trinitarian Revelation or change in God the Father and God the Holy Spirit or 'Self-Emptying of the Trinity to accomodate to mortal/temporal reality' is heterodoxy of the First Order.As the Bible actually teaches, the Son of God added a human nature to His Divine Nature without compromising/reducing/evacuating His Deity -FOR A SEASON ONLY (Pre-Glorification).To assert that the Father and the Holy Spirit also are Incarnatized,Finitized,Self-Emptying,Temporally Limited,Bi-Polar is to encroach WAY BEYOND what is written! Scripture knows of no such aberrant/overboard novel heterodoxy.3)If according to Pinnock God's Divine Attributes are all Self-Emptying (Omnipotence,Eternity, Omnipresence,Changelessness,etc.)then too must Omniscience be Self-Emptying/Temporalized/Limited/Finite. That's why he arrives at God not having any DEFINITE EXHAUSTIVE awareness of self-determining free-agent futures since they don't exist in God's 'present reality' to be known.The Future is NOT REAL!<br />In summary, Pinnock here and elsewhere with his conditional solidarity with Processistic thought as evidenced by his dialogue with Process/Bi-Polar theorists to shape his theology ends up to no surprise with a deity quite different from the Bible as held by Jews/Rabbis,Church Fathers,Prot.Reformers,Roman Catholic,Eastern Orthodox,Evangelical Historical interpretation of Scripture.The Incarnation of the Second Person of the Trinity for a specific,33-year miracle of Redemptive Revelation now becomes normative for the First and Third Persons of God as well who also share in the Incarnatization on an ongoing basis to properly,lovingly relate to us,distorting clear Bible teaching and making a mockery of the true doctrine/purpose of Christmas (it wasn't after all 'Patrimas'-Father's sending; or'Pneumas' -Spirit's sending; or 'Trinimas' -Trinity's sending,but CHRIST-mas:Christ's,Jesus',Son of God's mission.There is profound Mystery in the Incarnation and Triune Godhead, but to twist and tweak Cardinal Biblical Truth into Mystical/Mythical speculation/conjecture about the Father and Spirit being also in a sense Incarnatized similar to Christ,and even the Risen,Ascended,Glorified,Enthroned,Yet-to-Come Son of God being 'Self-Emptying'beyond His Resurrection/Glorification/Exaltation is Aberrant Heterodoxy of the First Magnitude on Cardinal Doctrinal levels.(See separate review of Pinnock's more recent 'Most Moved Mover' detailing its almost LDS/Mormon conception of an embodied/not-necessarily-<BR>pure-spirit-being-sort of deity and an errant Bible as well as a<BR>misprophesying Christ and other contra-biblical speculation).<br />This is what John MacArthur in 'Bound Only Once' has to conclude about Pinnock's brand of 'Self-Emptying Theism'-<br />In C.S.Lewis' Narnia Chronicles,Aslan,the fierce but loving lion,represents Christ the 'wild,not tame lion,both good and fearsome.People who have not been to Narnia sometimes think a thing can't be good and terrible at the same time.'<br />That same basic false assumption was the starting point for the heresy of Open Theism. New-model theologians assume God could not be good and terrible at the same time,so they set out to divest Him of whatever attributes they didn't like ('empty' him of them)and pad the ones they like (Love,Relational,Vulnerable,Intimate,Risk,Learn,Share,etc.)Like Socinians and liberals(processists)before them,they are on the misguided quest to make God 'good' according to humanistic/rationalistic definition of what they consider 'good',devising a deity of their own making (see Norm Geisler's book BATTLE FOR GOD refuting Open Theism).In the final book of Narnia,a wicked ape drapes a lion skin over a witless donkey and pretends it to be Aslan,a sinister,dangerous pretense leading countless Narnians astray. The Open deity is like the donkey in an ill-fitting lion's skin,leading many sincere seekers away from the glorious Son of God of Scripture.Aslan(Christ) is both good and fearsome,loving and wrathful,benevolent and terrifying,deliverer and destroyer,rewarder and punisher,blesser and curser. His wrath is just as real as His love,His fangs are just as real as His fur,His claws are every bit as real as His cuddliness.<br />If only Pinnock would have read more C.S.Lewis and Scripture and less of Hartshorne,Cobb,Whitehead and non-evangelical,liberal theorists,books like SEARCHING FOR AN ADEQUATE GOD would never have been written or need to be exposed as an artificial lion skin covering revisionist fantasy.	2001-12-13

Some brief quotes from a rebuttal from BOUND ONLY ONCE -FAILURE OF OPEN THEISM:<br />&quot;Openness movement as showcased in Sanders' God Who Risks violates fundamental principles of Bible interpretation, one of which is that passages clearly asserting a Doctrine or Divine<BR>Attribute (didactic) are to shed light on narrative/mortal referent/interactive texts, consistent with how language describing God in corporeal terms is properly interpreted by such 'Seat of Doctrine' texts as John 4 &quot;God is Spirit&quot;.<BR>Sanders turns this principle on its head, going to great lengths to establish patterns from narrative,interactive texts and then<BR>superimposing those templates onto clear,didactic<BR>Doctrinal/Divine Attribute texts. <BR>Voila'! Lo and behold! By this Interpretive Theory (used by <BR>Socinians in 16th Century) their deity changes his mind,repents,<BR>is sorry for misjudgments,regrets unfortunate decisions,is caught off guard,surprised,learns new things,grows in knowledge,<BR>is ignorant of self-determining free-agent futures,runs risks,<BR>is vulnerable,etc.&quot;<br />&quot;Sanders charges two-thousand years of Church History/Biblical <BR>Interpretation (including Church Fathers, Roman Catholic,Eastern<BR>Orthodox,Reformers,Historic Evangelical Theologians,Scholars and <BR>Laity,etc.) with 'hermeneutical(interpretive) malpractice'&quot; with woefully inadequate substantiation.&quot;<br />&quot;With its skewed presuppositions that God has only 'limited omniscience',i.e.multiscience of what will happen in free-agent<BR>futures, Openness must reconstruct plain verses to the contrary.<BR>The story of Joseph is a case in point. The clear text,even accepted by rabbinic/Jewish teaching as well as centuries of historical protestantism, is taken at face-value &quot;You (Joseph's<BR>brothers) meant evil against me; but God meant the evil for good,in order to bring it about as it is this day to save many people alive.&quot;(Gen.50:20)<BR>Sanders' spin is dismissive at best-&quot;I TAKE this to mean God has<BR>brought something good out of their evil actions..Joseph suggests that everyone look on the bright side - what God has done through this.&quot;<BR>From a profound,theological declaration of God's unmitigated<BR>providence (using sinners' evil as His tool for worldwide good,though Joseph had to suffer in the interim in slavery/prison<BR>through no fault of his own - much like Job), Sanders reductionism yields &quot;Serendipity!&quot;<br />&quot;Whether intentional or not, the Openness reading of Scripture,if<BR>applied throughout Theology, renders direct teachings of the Bible vacuous if not incomprehensible.&quot;<br />&quot;Contrary to Scripture's plain,millennia-long recognized emphasis/textual saturation of God as King/Sovereign, 'Sanders is quite eager to replace God as King with 'Risk-taker'.<BR>The 'risk' of creation had a 'great chance of success and little possibility of failure..although sin was possible -given this sort of world-it simply was not plausible in view of the good<BR>environment God established and the love he bestowed.'<BR>Sanders' Open Theism reduces the deity to a cosmic gambler, and not a very winning one at that.&quot;<br />&quot;Sanders and his Openness colleagues reduce God to the level of a t.v. meteorologist -one who makes astute,professional,expertly<br />informed prognostications based on all known variables/possibilities and their probabilities,i.e.educated guesses. It is one thing to base your picnic plans on a <BR>weatherman's forecast. But the Openness deity is,unfortunately,<BR>on multiple occasions, not much more infallible with the goings on in His Own universe, especially in the lives of all the billions of self-determining free-agents who activate their libertarian futures in ways unbeknownst to God in advance, creating all sorts of unlikely scenarios that take Him by divine<BR>surprise, like Holocausts,Pogroms,Terrorism,Wars,Persecutions<BR>and countless personal tragedies/horrors. And we are expected to trust a God like that?!?&quot;<br />&quot;A deity who risks is by implication one who has faith. Yet in all the Bible, neither 'faith' nor'risk' is ascribed to the LORD,<BR>whether explicitly or implicitly. Actually, the Holy Spirit <BR>declares '(mortals) live by faith, not by sight'. It is clear<BR>from Declarative/Didactic texts that The LORD lives by Divine/Definite/Exhaustive Hindsight,Insight,Foresight.&quot;<br />&quot;Events as significant as the Fall were, in Sanders'opinion,<BR>'totally unexpected', and even the cross was unplanned. Sanders<BR>realizes he is making an outrageous/shocking claim '-The notion that the cross was not planned will seem scandalous to some<BR>readers.' Nothing short of a direct assault on the Deity of not only Christ, but the Father Himself! A cursory review of all<BR>the prophecies/fulfillments in John's Gospel alone show this to be sheer fabrication and borderline blasphemous.&quot;<br />The only 'risk' is in the imaginative mind of the postgraduate<BR>student who chose such a 'risky' topic for his dissertation and those who choose to run the risk of leaving the Bible farther and farther behind with each passing page! The evangelical envelope has been successfully stretched - and torn to tatters no longer able to contain the Word of God or the God of the Word.	2001-11-30

It seeks to eliminate Divine Sovereign Definite Foreknowledge(by introducing an element of Nescience,i.e.'divine unknowability' about free-agent futures)and Creator's Consent from much of the world's evil/suffering in a failed attempt to absolve God of complicity. Boyd tries to give God a divine alibi, as it were: 'How could I the Lord have known those demons/wicked humans were going to do such horrible things, or that unpredictable nature/cosmic laws would end up so gratuitously tragic?! What a shock to omniscience/omnipresence/omnisapience!'<br />Unfortunately for the author,the whole premise of God at War and this continuing saga volume is undermined by one brief Scripture from Jesus: \\"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.But rather fear God Who is able to destroy both soul and body in Hell.Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?And not one of them falls to the ground APART FROM YOUR FATHER'S WILL. BUT THE VERY HAIRS OF YOUR HEAD ARE ALL NUMBERED.Do not fear therefore;you are of more value than many sparrows.\\"Matt.10:28-31<br />Jesus ascribes to God infinitely more foreknowledge,intelligence,wisdom,micro-awareness,omniscience than Boyd's paltry re-definition (which includes an unbiblical element of 'divine Nescience',an oxymoron of preposterous proportions!) In this text God possesses unlimited foreknowledge and consent of ALL THINGS,whether sparrows or sinners or saints (see Job for the LORD's involvement even in micro-specific weather patterns).<br />If the very hairs of human heads are all numbered and NOT ONE sparrow falls to the ground dead APART FROM GOD'S WILL, Boyd's entire neo-processistic co-presuppositional premise and 'neo-theodicy' finds itself fallen to the ground.If a SPARROW's death cannot happen apart from God's permissive knowledge/consent/will, how can any HUMAN suffering,tragedy,death,disaster,calamity -whether Holocaust,Pogrom,Terrorism,War,Plague,Hiroshima,Persecution,AIDS,etc.?? It all boils down to believing the word of Jesus or the words of Boyd.<br />What are the implications of this 'neo-method' of interpreting the Bible as to the Person of Jesus Christ? Staggering. To set aside or artificially 'harmonize' this and multiple other Divine Exhaustive Definite Foreknowledge and Sovereignty texts to fit the 'Open Theory/Theodicy' ultimately is to embrace a DIFFERENT JESUS than the Bible's.<br />In other books, the author has explicitly or implicitly alleged that the Classical,Historic,Orthodox understanding (in its Creeds,Confessions,historical documents,statements of belief,etc)of Jesus Christ's Divine Person/Nature/Attributes is faulty,erroneous,more man-made than biblically revealed: a Jesus Who,while having a human nature,also has a Divine Nature neither Self-Emptying(as Boyd's colleague Clark Pinnock puts it)nor finitized nor changing/repentable/learning/growing/developing/<BR>in-process,reversable. A Jesus Who never sinned,lied,erred,faulted,misspoke,misprophesied,got facts wrong,made well-intentioned mistakes,needed to repent/reverse himself of anything ever or regret any decision/action/intention. A Jesus Whose Father's Divine Nature/Attributes are identical to His Own. A Jesus Who can relate to us perfectly well without,as Open Theory postulates 'actualizing his temporal pole',i.e.Neo-Process Bi-Polar finite godism (see separate reviews of Pinnock's Most Moved Mover, Hartshorne's Omnipotence& Other Theological Mistakes, Boyd's Trinity & Process,Norman Geisler's Battle ForGod.)<br />In fact,Geisler is right on target with his excellent refutation and expose' of Neo-Theism. What the Church is dealing with by Boyd's Open Theory Challenge in this book is: WHICH JESUS IS THE REAL JESUS? It's literally a BATTLE FOR JESUS, more than just a peripheral problem with Satan's activities and human suffering.<br />If Boyd is correct in this book about 'divine nescience' of a significant part of the future; Divine Nature/Attributes of Christ; the future being NOT REAL/NON-EXISTENT until He or we create it; most evil/suffering/tragedy in earth's war zone occurring unbeknownst to God beforehand apart from His Sovereign Knowledge or Consent; if Boyd's Open Theory Theodicy is Orthodoxy, then Historical Classical Christianity of Athanasius,Augustine,Hus,Wycliff,Luther,Zwingli,Knox,Melanchthon,Arminius,Wesley,Spurgeon,C.S.Lewis et al regarding this crucial subject and other Major Doctrines of the Faith is heterodoxy.Idolatry.False Witness.Aberrancy.Pseudo-Doctrine. In a way, Boyd's books claim to represent Luther's 95 theses posted on the Church Door to call the Church back to repentance and restoration of Biblical truth a la Open Theory to replace/reform Classical,Historic Theology as most Scriptural.<br />But if Classical Christianity is Orthodox about these important Cardinal Doctrines of the Faith concerning the Person/Nature/Attributes of the REAL JESUS, then Open Theory-Theodicy is.....<br />This book literally throws down the gauntlet to Christendom,making it clear the Church can't have it both ways: Classical Theodicy/Sovereignty/Jesus'Divine Attributes or Open Theory.Either a Matt.10 God Relationally Sovereign over ALL GOOD/EVIL,BLESSING/CURSING,LIFE/DEATH,GRACE/GRIEF,COMFORT/CALAMITY,PEACE/WAR,SERENITY/SUFFERING,TRIUMPH/TRAGEDY,MICRO/MACRO,GEN'L/SPECIFIC,CORPORATE/PERSONAL,SUPERNATURAL/NATURAL,HEAVENLY/EARTHLYSPIRITUAL/PHYSICAL,ETERNAL/TEMPORAL without exception, or not.There can't be both of these mutually exclusive theodicies/theologies being equally valid,viable about the True Triune Godhead and Person of Jesus Christ. Either 'Sparrow Theodicy'or 'Nescience Theodicy'.<br />May the REAL JESUS continue to make Himself known through His having suffered for us, and our suffering in His Name, whether we understand its origin/divine purpose or not.<br />This theoretical theodicy simply fails as theory AND theodicy,failing to adequately 'justify God's ways to man' or grasp Luther's insight that 'Satan is God's devil'.If only this book had considered Amos 3:6 \\"If there is calamity in a city, will not the LORD have done it?\\"	2001-11-26

Books	5	4	8	N	N	EXPOSES OPEN THEORIST INTERPRETIVE FLAWS/SKEW	This book warns of a dangerous aberration by the evangelical left<BR>(and so-called 'moderates')of fabricating the deity in man's image. The 'Open Theory' or 'Neo-Theism' deviates from the Historic,Classical,Orthodox interpretation of the Bible held as<BR>generally accepted from Old Test.,Apostolic,Church Fathers,<BR>Reformation eras to Contemporary Conservative Evangelical times<BR>and strays off into the land of neo-Socinian,Post-modernist,<BR>unorthodox skewage.<br />To understand the Open Theory of Bible interpretation, it is <BR>paramount to grasp the Classical Contemporary Evangelical <BR>Orthodox truth as accurately and fairly summarized (for example<BR>by Millard Erickson's Christian Theology,God the Father Almighty)<BR>Then,compare this balanced Biblical position to the exaggerated<BR>caricature set up by neo-theists such as Pinnock,Rice,Sanders,<BR>Boyd &amp;Co. which is the 'straw theology' they are overreacting<BR>against. Finally,compare the Open Theory with Process Theology<BR>(also called 'panentheism'-God is in all, all is in God, or<BR>pantemporalism -all is in time/temporal,including the deity,<BR>i.e.non-transcendent immanence)from which neo-theists borrow <BR>heavily on their misguided path to aberrancy.<br />The unfortunate,misbegotten result is a hybrid,blend,synthesis,<BR>hodge-podge of quasi-classical/processistic Bible interpretation<BR>that is less exegesis(objective,plenary extraction of textual <BR>data) than eisegesis(subjective,presuppositional,selective<BR>insertion of extra-textual data).<br />The orthodox sine qua non of &quot;SCRIPTURE AS A WHOLE INTERPRETS TEXTS IN THEIR PARTS&quot; is turned on its head by the Open Theory to 'Selective,favorable texts in their parts interpret/inform <BR>Scripture as a whole'. Evangelical exegesis has Declarative<BR>texts control Narrative texts,i.e ATTRIBUTE TEXTS CONTROL <BR>ACTION/ALLUSION/NARRATIVE texts, never vice-versa.<br />For example,Orthodox exegesis takes all Scripture depicting God<BR>as Spirit,invisible,immortal,eternal,infinite,etc.(FIRST SET) as<BR>determinitive/controlling over those texts saying God has <BR>physical form:Right Hand,eyes,ears,sitting,coming down,looking,<BR>wings,etc.(SECOND SET) The First Set is properly understood as<BR>literal,declarative,doctrinal and thus informs/interprets the <BR>Second Set as non-literal,figurative,metaphor,anthropomorphic,<BR>analogy,figures of speech) to arrive at Biblical truth.<BR>Even Open Theorists agree that to reverse the process of having<BR>the Second Set be literal and controlling over the First Set<BR>results in improper interpretation, e.g.'God has wings'.<BR>Equally erroneous is to equate First Set and Second Set as<BR>synonymous/equivalent,e.g.'God is a winged Spirit'.<br />Sadly and unwittingly, the Open Theory commits this very fallacy<BR>when it comes to non-physical form texts,claiming such 'fresh<BR>exegesis' is superior to Orthodox interpretation. For example,<BR>instead of properly taking all texts depicting God as Spirit,<br />invisible,immortal,eternal,infinite,all-wise,all-knowing,all-<BR>present,transcendent-immanent,perfect,sinless,infallible,divine,<BR>all-powerful,all-loving/just,kind/stern,self-sufficient,<BR>self-existent,constant/unwavering/unvarying/stable as normative,<BR>literal,declarative doctrinal texts(First Set), it takes texts<BR>saying God 'repents','changes mind','alters plans','adapts to changing circumstances','perhaps','if only','Why?''How long?'<BR>'regrets','rues','risks','takes chances','wonders','is surprised<BR>'re-evaluates'(i.e. all favorite texts cited by Neo-theists to<BR>prove their theory)(Second Set) as controlling or at least<BR>equally normative,declarative doctrinal texts on a par with<BR>First Set texts, inconsistent with how they take the physical-form texts.<BR>In other words, one interpretive principle is applied by the Open<BR>Theory for God's EXTERNAL descriptive texts, and another <BR>(the reverse) is applied to God's INTERNAL descriptive texts.<BR>The mortal language of the Bible for God's EXTERNAL characteristics is considered anthropomorphic/metaphor/non-<BR>literal, but for God's INTERNAL characteristics,mortal language<BR>is now deemed literal,non-anthropomorphic,definitive equally with<BR>First Set texts! This is the key to Open Theory: Anthropomorphism is allowed for EXTERNAL mortal language texts,<BR>but NOT for INTERNAL mortal language texts (non-physical form).<BR>No explanation or defense of this inconsistent reversal of <BR>generally accepted Orthodox interpretive principles is ever<BR>given; it is assumed as a presupposition tacitly,a given.<br />Open Theorists cite and recite about a dozen or so favorite,<BR>selective texts that show God apparently regretting decisions<BR>about making the world (Oops!);repenting of making Saul king<BR>(What have I done?);testing Abraham (I wonder if..);threatening<BR>Nineveh then at the last minute reversing course with a change of heart/mind (Whew,that was close!);warning Hezekiah he would die then,after reconsidering the remorseful king's tears/prayers<BR>revising original plans (Oh,all right, I give in, you win),etc.<BR>These Second Set texts (narrative,not declarative) now become<BR>determinitive and normative to interpret/inform the First Set<BR>texts. So we have &quot;I the LORD do not change (except when it is<BR>expedient/beneficial..)&quot;; &quot;the LORD is not a son of man that He<BR>should repent (except when confronted with new information/<BR>free-agent reality as their unforeseeable futures are activated<BR>necessitating unexpected divine response/reversal..)&quot;<br />The Open Theory of Bible interpretation both reverses the Orthodox Evangelical Generally Accepted Principles (Second Set<BR>INTERNAL qualities mortal language expressions control or equate<BR>to First Set IMMORTAL,DIVINE ATTRIBUTES)and is inconsistent in applying their backward hermeneutic to these texts, not EXTERNAL<BR>qualities mortal language expressions)<BR>Neo-theists have a deity which repents,rues,runs risks,reverses,<BR>reconsiders - regardless of what clear,literal,doctrinal,<BR>declarative First Set texts say. He repents even though he is not a son of man and thus doesn't repent. He changes when <BR>beneficial though he is the LORD who does not change.<BR>This is what happens when figurative,narrative language texts<BR>interpret or equate with literal,declarative texts, when <BR>metaphor is jettisoned for wooden literalism, when valid<BR>anthropomorphisms are selectively acknowledged and mostly ruled<BR>out as a given before the interpretive process gets started.<BR>This book makes these crucial points abundantly clear to the <BR>reader open to Scriptural witness. <BR>It's either DECLARATIVE,ATTRIBUTES CONTROL ACTION/ALLUSION/<BR>NARRATIVE (Orthodox Exegesis) or vice-versa (Open Theory)<BR>Let the informed reader decide.	2001-11-19

In this book, he actually gives a tribute to Charles Hartshorne, a Process Theist,<BR>saying his view of a Process model of reality/theology is essentially correct, after a bit of a critical re-evaluation, like adding the Trinity, Creation ex nihilo, retaining many of <BR>Classical Attributes of God such as non-dependence on creation,<BR>Supreme Power (not quite Omnipotent/Almighty),exhaustive hindsight/recollection of the past and knowledge of all present<BR>reality (but stopping short on free-will future agency which Boyd<BR>considers 'unrealized possibility, non-existent even to God').<br />Boyd succeeds in stretching the Biblical interpretive envelope<BR>only to have it tear in so many places that it no longer is able<BR>to contain the Word of God and the God of the Word.

These presuppositions<BR>are paramount in Open Theorist systemization of theology:<br />1)Libertarian Free Will, where free agents have no interference<BR>from the outside (Divine or otherwise) in freely choosing between<BR>real alternatives<BR>2)Anthropomorphism/Metaphors are out and Literalism is in for <BR>evaluating texts showing God 'repenting','rueing','regretting',<BR>'changing the divine mind','revising plans/prophecies due to <BR>unforeseen free-agent choices unbeknownst in advance<BR>3)Extensive Temporal Forecasting, eliminating the historic <BR>Omniscience of Exhaustive Divine/Definite Foreknowledge of future free-agency; much of the future is unforeknown by God's<BR>choice thus unsettled/'open', while some of what God chooses to foreknow(what He intends to do) is settled.

Yet, this distorted lens of Classical/<BR>Process Synthesis is carried forward into all<BR>Boyd's subsequent volumes with little pause for reflection as to why Classical views held for millennia by Protestant,Roman Catholic,Eastern<BR>Orthodox,etc. had gotten things so off track it took Socinians<BR>in the 16th Century, some obscure theologians in the late 19th<BR>Century and Boyd,Pinnock,Sanders &amp;Co. in these latter days to set Christendom straight!	2001-11-17

Here are a few Bible texts which lay Open Theism's errant views to rest:<br />Gen 3:16 &quot;(Eve)I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY YOUR SORROW in childbirth,<BR>in pain you shall bring forth children..&quot;<br />Gen 3:17 &quot;CURSED is the ground for your(Adam's) sake...&quot;<br />Gen 6:7 &quot;I WILL DESTROY MAN whom I have created from the face of the earth,both man and beast..&quot;<br />Gen 6:17 &quot;I MYSELF AM BRINGING FLOODWATERS ON EARTH TO DESTROY from under heaven ALL FLESH; everything that is on earth shall die..&quot;<br />Gen 50:20 &quot;You (Joseph's brothers) meant evil against me; but God meant the evil for good in order to bring it about to save many people alive.&quot;<br />2Sam 24:1 &quot;Again the anger of the LORD was aroused against Israel<BR>and HE MOVED David against them to number the people..&quot;<br />1Chr 21:1 (parallel verse) &quot;Now SATAN stood up against Israel and moved David to number the people..&quot;<br />Job 1:12 &quot;The LORD said to Satan,'Behold,all Job has is in your power;only do not lay a hand on his person..'&quot;<br />Job 2:3 &quot;Still Job holds fast to his integrity,although you(Satan)incited Me against him to destroy him without cause..&quot;<BR>v.6 &quot;The LORD said to Satan,'Behold,Job is in your hand, but spare his life.'&quot;<BR>v.10 &quot;'Shall we accept good from God and not accept ADVERSITY from God?'In all this Job did not sin with his lips.&quot;<br />Job 42:11 &quot;Job's family consoled and comforted him for all the <BR>ADVERSITY THE LORD HAD BROUGHT UPON HIM.&quot;<br />Rom 8:20-22 &quot;For the creation was subjected to futility,not willingly (so much for'libertarian freedom'),but because of HIM<BR>WHO SUBJECTED IT in hope because the creation itself also will be delivered from the BONDAGE OF CORRUPTION into the glorious<BR>liberty of the children of God.For we know the WHOLE CREATION GROANS AND LABORS WITH BIRTH PANGS together until now.&quot;<br />Rom 11:32 &quot;For GOD HAS COMMITTED THEM ALL TO DISOBEDIENCE that He<BR>might have MERCY ON ALL.&quot;<br />James 5:11 &quot;You have heard of the perseverence of Job and seen the END INTENDED BY THE LORD.&quot;<br />Rev.6:10-11 &quot;'How long,O Lord,holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on earth?'It was said to them<BR>(beheaded souls under Heaven's altar)they should rest a while longer until the number of their fellow servants/brothers<BR>WHO MUST BE KILLED AS THEY WERE WAS COMPLETED.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, this book did not bother to engage with these texts nor did it adequately wrestle with the Biblical concept of <BR>GOD'S CURSE ON CREATION,WORKING IN/WITH/THROUGH CREATURELY EVIL/<BR>EVILDOERS LIKE SATAN,SINNERS TO ACCOMPLISH HIS ETERNAL,RIGHTEOUS<BR>HEAVENLY,KINGDOM PURPOSES,USING DIABOLICALLY/HUMANLY INITIATED<BR>WICKEDNESS LIKE HOLOCAUSTS,POGROMS,TERRORISM,WARS,CRIME,ETC. TO <BR>ULTIMATELY DELIVER HIS OWN AND PUNISH IMPENITENT SINNERS WHO REJECT HIS SON.<br />Boyd also modifies/modulates God's Divine Attributes to accomodate his worldview: under Openness,God does not have Exhaustive Divine/Definite Foreknowledge of free-agent decisions,<BR>only 'extensive temporal forecasting'.Since evil and Satan's activities occur (Nazism,Hitler,Stalin,ethnic cleansings,pogroms,<BR>wars,AIDS,terrorism) without God's apparent foreknowledge or consent, He must creatively respond to such horrors as they happen in His present unbeknownst to Him beforehand, making Him <BR>not complicit,abetting or involved in the evil(the Openness'<BR>good deity would never use evil in any of His plans/intentions/<BR>actions, being benevolent, no matter what ends might justify the means toward fulfillment of an eternal divine plan).<br />This warped,unbiblical reasoning is like saying a battlefield<BR>general cannot/does not take into account military intelligence<BR>about evil intentions of the enemy and by a masterstroke use that intel to thwart the enemy to produce ultimate victory by <BR>making the enemy act or decide in counterproductive or backfiring<BR>ways to carry through with the enemy plans thus defeating the enemy by allowing him to play into the general's plans (see the <BR>Old Testament: Joshua,Gideon,David,Warrior-Kings that God gave<BR>strategic advantage to, knowing enemy evil intentions in advance and leveraging those plans against the enemy's own actions for a greater victory).<BR>That's what God does with evildoers, and what He did with Satan<BR>on the Cross.<br />In conclusion, this book makes for interesting reading, but leaves the Bible behind with each passing page. It is wholly<BR>inadequate to defend the ultimately indefensible,unbiblical position of blaming all evil on Satan/sinners, when in fact God<BR>Himself initiated the CURSE in punishment for human rebellion.<BR>God Himself does not sin or commit evil, but freely uses what<BR>Satan/Sinners do ( even the most extreme wickedness) to fulfill<BR>Scripture and His eternal,planned purposes of Redemption and<BR>Judgment. Keep trying Dr. Boyd. Perhaps by the next book in the series, you'll get closer to the Biblical truth that 'Satan is <BR>God's devil' like Luther said.<BR>&quot;ARE YOU NOT IN ERROR BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW THE SCRIPTURES OR THE POWER OF GOD?&quot;	2001-11-13

Rather it is shamefully exposed as threadbare,moth-eaten pernicious error, a pseudo-evangelical garment ill-fitting the Bible.<br />*Under Openness/Ajarism, with the deity ignorant of future free agency,how can there be Scriptural inspiration of the Biblical authors if the Holy Spirit doesn't even know what Moses,David,Isaiah,Luke,Paul,John arechoosing to write beforehand? God knows what He intends to say, but without crude,mechanical,compulsory dictation,where does the voluntary authorship of the human agents fit in to ensure inerrancy,infallibility,accuracy and completeness absent Divine Foreknowledge in the 'theopneustos' equation of:Divine Agency + Human Authorship = Word of God?<br />*We have moved from Biblical orthodoxy to neo-orthodoxy to liberal unorthodoxy now with an offshoot to neo-libertarianism(self-limited,vulnerable,risk-taking,bi-polar,self-emptying deity unable to possess more than 1)a shared power/authority co-arrangement with fallen beings; 2)extensive part-macro definite/most-micro indefinite forecasting of free-agent futures capability; 3)finiteness in the form of temporal-spatial-material divinity to meaningfully relate to the time-space-matter continuum He created; 4)Quasi-omnipresence,no longer every<BR>where-when,everythere-then,everyhere-now omni-past,omni-present,omni-future but pretty much mere 'presentism' only with exhaustive recollection of the past and projection of all future possibilities, none of which are actualized from God's perspective or experience yet.) What next after Ajarism? Wide-Openism?<br />*It is claimed by open theists:&quot;If God is truly omnipotent, then agents have no genuine power or authority over their agency,decisions,destinies nor real responsibility/meaning/worth.<BR>Thus God can't be Omnipotent, but 'Multi-potent', the most powerful among all the powers that be such as Satan,demons,angels and man who have much latitude,free-exercise rights and power of self-determination, which God (not Almighty or El Shaddai any longer) at very rare and reluctant discretion retains the right to override/veto/intervene to keep things on track to accomplish some semblance of progress toward ultimate divine success in the creative enterprise called Earth.&quot;<BR> <BR>What byzantine,labyrinthine,warped reasoning! By that peculiar logic, one could just as easily claim &quot;If God is truly Omniscient, then agents have no genuine knowledge, but are aware of nothing. If God is truly Omnipresent, then agents don't exist since there's no point-moment of space-time God doesn't exclusively occupy!&quot;Sorry Open Theists (and any Process Theists,neo-Socinians,neo-libertarians listening in). The Bible says God is Omnipotent.Does that mean we are powerless,i.e. Omnimpotent?<br />God is Omniscient. Are we Omnignorant,knowing nothing,nada,zilch?God is Omnipresent.

This is one of the finest entries into the current debate between the Evangelical community and Open Theists who are trying to join the ranks and make their Socinian/Processistic<BR>views acceptable among Evangelicalism. <br />Fortunately, Openness has failed before it has begun combat, even though it appears here and there to be winning a few battles.

Hardly!&quot;<br />&quot;In C.S.Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, Aslan, the fierce but loving lion,represents Christ the 'wild,not tame lion,both good and fearsome. 'People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time.'<BR>That same basic false assumption was the starting point for the heresy of Open Theism.New-model theologians (Pinnock,Boyd,et al) begin with the assumption that the God of the Bible could not be good and terrible at the same time, so they set out to divest Him of whatever attributes they didn't like.Like Socinians and liberals (processists) who preceded them, they are on a misguided quest to make God 'good' according to humanistic,<BR>earthbound definition of 'good',devising a deity of their own making.<BR>In the final book of Narnia series, a wicked ape drapes a lion skin over a witless jackass and pretends it to be Aslan, a sinister and dangerous pretense leading countless Narnians astray. The deity of Open theism is like the jackass in an ill-<BR>fitting lion's skin,leading many sincere seekers away from the glorious Son of God of Scripture.<BR>God is both good and fearsome ('Consider the kindness and sternness/severity of God'-Ro.11:22).His wrath is just as real as His love, His fur as real as His fangs, His cuddliness as real as His claws.&quot;<br />Much Biblical food for thought, categorically refuting the aberration of Open Theism for those open to Scriptural witness.<br />A tour de force!

Award him points for stretching the evangelical envelope. But the envelope tears when he tries to build a case for openness, where the deity is more than just open to our input,prayers,decisions, but who is unable to know as definite in advance just what that input will be.<br />Somewhere in the openness model, God's Attributes are downgraded.<BR>For example, Omniscience is now multiscience-not 100% knowledge,<BR>but only all we logically imagine he could possible be aware of,<BR>excluding much of free-agent future decisions. The Biblical position of Exhaustive Divine/Definite Foreknowledge of free agency in micro is reduced to extensive temporal forecasting in macro, thus agency and responsibility are 'preserved' and 'genuine'.<br />This book boldly goes where few men (and fewer angels) have gone before (Socinians,Whitehead,Hartshorne,Peirce,many Process theologians like Cobb).<br />Pinnock dares to jettison the position of Old Testament Judaism,<BR>New Testament apostolic authors,Christ Himself,Early Church Fathers as Augustine/Athanasius,Reformers like Luther,Calvin,<BR>Melanchthon,Bucer,Zwingli,Knox;later theologians like Arminius,<BR>Wesley,Edwards,Spurgeon,Walther,Pieper,Lenski,Matthew Henry,<BR>Carl Henry,et al,as well as historical Roman Catholic,Orthodox <BR>scholarship.<br />The close association with Process Thought (not wholly embraced,<BR>but selective,cafeteria-style concepts that fit Openness control<BR>beliefs) is evident with much dialog and mutual admiration by Openness and Process Theologians, summarized in two recent books:<BR>Pinnock's &quot;SEARCHING FOR AN ADEQUATE GOD: DIALOG BETWEEN PROCESS AND FREE WILL THEISM&quot;; Boyd's &quot;Trinity and PROCESS:Critical Evaluation of HARTSHORNE'S DI-POLAR THEISM Toward a Trinitarian<BR>Metaphysic.&quot;<br />This book is an interesting read, but leavesthe Bible behind with each passing page.<br />For the reader seeking a modern,contemporary,updated,revised,<BR>user-friendly theological model, a hybrid between traditional,historical,Biblical,Classical Evangelical Theology<BR>and significant blendings of Di-Polar Process Theism, Openness as promoted by Pinnock's book as a 'synthesis' or compromise,<BR>this book would be welcome.	2001-10-26

For example, God is no longer Biblically understood to have Omniscience (Exhaustive Divine/Definite Foreknowledge of future free decisions at the micro level), but is 'updated' to 'Multiscience', knowing a great deal, but not 100% ('extensive temporal forecasting' at the macro level).<br />As engaging as the book is, it fails to engage Scripture in a plenary,accurate,consistent way; it uses selective texts, applies<BR>questionable at best interpretive principles,and falls short as an attempt at serious,even popular level scholarship.<br />These Bible passages are either neglected or mishandled and thus leaves the openness position open to categorical refutation:<br />Psalm 147:5 \\"His understanding is INFINITE.\\" Unless the Hebrew and English words for INFINITE have changed, the Openness view of the deity's 'Multiscience' is internally imploded.<br />A brief trip through Judges (Gideon&Midianite Dream) and Kings<BR>(Elisha's Tears re Hazael/Elijah's Prior Prophecy; Elisha's Barley Futures; Man of God's prophecy re Josiah -1Ki.13:1-3 -<BR>\\"A man of God went to Bethel by the word of the LORD and King<BR>Jeroboam stood by the altar.

One couldn't ask for a more 'pygmy'view of the divine nature (with all due respect to pygmies), putting their deity into humanly grapsed dimensions of reality and comprehension rather than letting the Bible's metaphoric language speak of God for itself. The list goes on demonstrating how inconsistent Openness' selective hermeneutic is to 'prove' their position. Nothing is proved except that Openness is a warmed over hybrid/synthesis of modern processistic thought (God is di-polar,temporal/spatial, discovering,regretting,rueing,growing,developing,evolving, learning, in process, etc.) mixed with classical thought to produce something neither intellectually, Biblically, or cogently satisfying. Open theism is shut out Scripturally! One star for this volume is one too many!	2001-08-25

Openness views God as essentially temporal as He relates to temporal beings. What the future is for us is pretty much how it is for God.<br />A few Scriptures are devastating to that kind of speculative, humanistic theory (with touches of processistic thinking)<br />1)ELISHA'S BARLEY FUTURES - 2Kings 6:24-25;7:1-2,16-20. Consider the immense extent,nature and timing of the convergence of individual free-agent decisions,actions,wills that the LORD thru Elisha was able to precisely,definitely,certainly,exactly foretell 24 hours in advance: &quot;about this time tomorrow a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and 2 seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.&quot; Clearly an unconditional,  Exhaustive Definite/Divine Foreknowledge prophecy, fairly routine for an Omniscient God of the Bible Who could easily foretell (not forecast) exactly what the barley futures market would be within 24 hours and communicate it to Elisha, etc.<br />2) GIDEON &amp; MIDIANITE DREAM (Judges 7:9-15). Based on Open Theism's own criteria regarding prophecies 'involving free decisions of creatures..which appear unconditional if the acts  prophesied are too far in the future to be surmised from the present characters of the agents involved and are self-determining acts..if these conditions are met, then this would in principle refute the open view'.<br />Consider the open view Scripturally refuted, based on openness' own criteria. There is no cogent,objective engagement of these or other crucial passages in any Openness literature, with good reason. They are simply irrefutable.<br />The more one compares books like this with such inconvenient Bible texts (see also ELISHA'S TEARS, 2Kings 8), the more one sees that free-will theism's 'possible god' is impossible to digest or theologically accept.<br />Thankfully, the Classical View (Free-will future is open to us, but settled and Exhaustively Foreknown as Definite to the LORD) is not at risk from such hybrid systems as Openness, which mostly synthesizes Processistic ideas with Classical ones to produce a New, Open-minded theology which is not intellectually or Biblically satisfying.<br />One star for this book is one star too many!	2001-08-07

This is an outstanding refutation of the fallacy/aberration of  Open Theism that is taking so many well-intentioned minds captive to the hollow philosophies of this world. But more than that this is a positive affirmation of the correct, evangelical Christian view of a truly Omniscient God Who has complete awareness of all things (Exhaustive Definite/Divine Foreknowledge of all creaturely free-will future decisions). Anything less is quasi-omniscience. Open Theism is warmed-over processistic thinking synthesized with Classical Theism to create a brand new hybrid which is Biblically and rationally unsatisfying and demeaning to the LORD GOD. Open Theism is desperately trapped in two-dimensional, pygmy thinking-(x,y) coordinates only- in their truncated space-time understanding.  What is sadly lacking is the z coordinate, the  divine dimension of understanding what Scripture and science say about time, space, divine attributes and what is possible for God. Must reading for those concerned about a dangerous dilution of  evangelical understanding of Who God is and What He knows and  When He can know it. Open Theism is closed out Scripturally!	2001-07-24

The best way to read the masters is to have an outstanding guide like this one, or Timothy Steele's &quot;All the Fun's In How You Say a Thing&quot;, both must-have companions for the serious composer of metered/rhymed poetry. Alfred Corn has done New Formalism poetry a massive favor with this book. How does Thomas Hardy get his Darkling Thrush to sing so melodiously, flinging his soul into the air? Read this volume and find out how Hardy masters end rhyme using subtle variation of one,two and three syllable words of different parts of speech: noun,verb,adjective,etc. How does Frost rivet our attention with his Road Less Taken? Metrical variation, not sing-song monotony, as Corn masterfully explains. How does Auden leave indelible impressions in the reader's memory with his villanelle 'If I Could Tell You'? Corn sketches the poetic canvass for the careful reader to see the brush-strokes,tones,textures,context, colors,etc.  To be a better poet, or to be a more appreciative reader of the great poets and discern what doesn't quite measure up, get this book and Steele's &quot;All the Fun&quot;.

One of the latest theological 'fads' hitting the mental marketplace of ideas is 'Openness' or what is better called  'Ajarism': the future is a door ajar to God, part of which He can see and know, part of which He cannot.<br />A few brief Scriptures put Ajarism to rest: 1Ki.19:15-17 (God's command/prophecy to Elijah regarding Hazael, King of Aram and Elisha, successor prophet); 2Ki.8:9-15 (God's prophetic revelation to Elisha about Hazael, confirming the Elijah prophecy many years earlier)<br />Just this Biblical sequence of Elijah, Elisha and Hazael involving exhaustive definite future prediction/prophecy, anointing and specific divine foreknowledge punctures the ajarism concept as unbiblical and untenable. Please read these scriptures carefully as to what God knew and when He knew it, what He communicated to Elijah and Elisha and what was fulfilled in Hazael's life.

Having experienced personal tragedy, he tries to portray his attempts at making sense of the dark seasons of life that God allows to be sent our way. While not perhaps quite at the level of prowess or majesty as Hardy, Yeats, Housman, de la Mare, Frost, Robinson, Masefield, Auden, Wilbur or Santayana, nonetheless Gioia remains one of the world's finest poets. The fact that he has the courage to face unpleasant subjects head on as he does shows his boldness as a poet. Veterans Cemetary is a classic treatment of passing on.

Wilbur uses this poem as an example of how much the meaning of a great poem resides in its sound, pacing, diction, literary references('Wages of sin is death': Romans 6:23), its convention - the deliberate movement that releases the full and powerful sonority the author intended.

Yeats	Books	5	20	27	N	N	IRISH GENIUS WITH WORLDWIDE, POSTHUMOUS APPEAL	Before a reasoned, intelligent assessment of Yeats (or any other master poet such as Hardy, Frost,de la Mare, Wilbur, et al) can be made, one must ask the right preliminary question: What is Genius-level poetry? There are at least 6 primary components: 1)It withholds something from us at first, yielding its secrets slowly, like an attractive lover or an ocean (sand, shoreline, shallows, surfzone, shelf, offshore, blue depths);2)It surprises and satisfies simultaneously - it repays multiple re-readings:  'I knew that but I didn't know until now that I knew it'; 3) It is words set to life's music - it sounds, or sings, special, through appropriate rhythm and rhyme. Follow the music and the other senses follow along; follow the voice til you have no choice; 4)It is memorable, both in detailed words, metaphors, images, literary referents, phrasings, lines, sections/stanzas, and as a sum of things which exceeds the excellencies of the parts. It is memorizable. 5)It speaks to life's questions: what could be worse than answering questions no one is asking?; above all relevance synthesizes with reverence to create resonance. Its subject matter matters. Nothing is missing more in most poetry published today than lack of compression, resolution, depth: too much verse is a pretty pond acres wide, inches deep. Especially powerful verse has simplicity in perichoresis (interpenetration) with complexity or multiplicity, ambidextrously able to use telescope or microscope to bring the subject into focus for the reader. The best of Seuss appeals also to adults; the arcanest of Einstein, E=mc2, can even be grasped by children;Lastly,6) It fulfills its expectations and arrives: it reaches the reader at some point, in different ways at different times. Though woods are lovely, dark and deep;with miles to go before I sleep, there are still promises to keep.

Sitting at Wilbur's feet for years can't help but enable some of his craft to rub off by sheer delight or osmosis. Merely by associating with poetry the way it was meant to be written can permanently raise the bar of anyone's craftsmanship to new levels.  There is a richness in Wilbur's best work that is unrivaled among his contemporaries and matched by few of his predecessors  (Frost, Robinson, Yeats, Hardy, Housman). Also recommended: get your hands and mind on anything Wilbur has written in the form of Essays/Prose that describe what great poetry is and why it will always be core to the human condition. Although Auden once said 'poetry doesn't make anything happen' in his Sept.1939 tribute to Yeats' death, Wilbur's comes closest to making something happen at the spiritual, cognitive and affective level of the human psyche that proves his subject matter matters and always will. Other than the late Frost, no American poet would be more richly deserving of the Nobel Prize for Literature than Richard Wilbur. But as a sincere Christian, he is laboring for no mortal pay; however, he humbly deserves all the accolades and tributes from what is past,or passing, or to come.	2000-12-01

The best essay is the short piece on fellow Massachusetts poet, the late Robert Francis. While much of Francis' work is trivial, though technically proficient, his masterpiece has to be Sheep: 'From where I stand the sheep stand still/As stones against the stony hill./The stones are gray/ And so are they./  And both are weatherworn and round,/Leading the eye back to the ground./Two mingled flocks - /The sheep, the rocks./ And still no sheep stirs from its place/Or lifts its Babylonian face.' Wilbur writes how grateful he is for its perfection. Other essays include those on Tennyson, Poe, Milton and one of his favorite subjects: Riddles, alone worth the price of the book. Instead of signing up for a poetry workshop, get this book and its companion Responses: Prose Pieces 1953-76 and go to school with the Master of Rhymecraft.	2000-12-01

Testifies to the rugged durability of his evocative poetic gift. Especially nice about this volume are the range and depth of Masefield's best poetry, which spurred me to begin re-reading him and other great poets of his day (Thomas Hardy, W.B.Yeats, Frost,Walter de la Mare, Edwin Arlington Robinson, etc.). Most of the best output is early in his career (Salt Water Ballads, Dauber, Lollingdon Downs,Everlasting Mercy), the poem Sea Fever being the most representative of his genius for making nature come alive in mind and spirit.  To summarize Masefield's poetic legacy: 'He writes as freshly as possible bringing us back to a marvel of sustained versecraft, leaping gaps of time and tide, reminding us of the immediacy of nature, especially tales of the open sea with a vitality and purity of resonance still affecting audiences in the 21st Century. If you have a love of the Sea, this book and Masefield's poems will whisk you there for a journey. Bon Voyage!<br />One of Masefield's last poems (excerpt): Musicians, painters, poets of when/Who made the world more lovely then/The story-tellers beyond price,/Bringing the news from Paradise/Those from whose handiwork we see/Horizons in eternity.<br />Now that my roving days are over,/And all my frontiers stop at Dover/I think of what Life used to mean/When all these artists trod the scene/And Life was in myself with them/In Troy, in Greece, and Bethlehem.	2000-11-30

If you enjoy the poetry of Thomas Hardy, W.B.Yeats, Robert Frost, Tennyson,Longfellow, John Masefield, Wilfred Owen, Phyllis McGinley, C.S.Lewis, Walter de la Mare, W.H.Auden, E.A.Robinson, A.E.Housman, Calvin Miller, Richard Wilbur, A.E.Stallings, you will revel in this collection of a lifetime's oeuvre.<br />In the words of Auden:    In the eyes of every author,/   His past work falls into four classes:/   First, pure rubbish he regrets/   Ever having given bother/   To conceive. Second, mixed masses-/   For him, most painful - mongrel pets/   Of good ideas which impatience,/   Incompetency brought to nil/   (Fair notions fatally injured). Third,/   Lacking importance par creations:/   These three, bulk of the oeuvre which skill/   Plied. Fourth, poems worth the warmest word/   Of honest gratefulness from him,/   In volume depressingly slim.<br />Gjertrud's collection has few of Auden's first three classes. The best verse is the epitome of organizational skill in bringing together meaningful, moving elements into a whole greater than the sum of its parts that 'arrives', 'fulfills' and reaches the reader in a memorable way. Like all good poets, she attempts to amplify what she sees and experiences by probing for correspondences that relate dissimilarities. Through rhymed communication, she invites inquirers to share her discoveries and reveries. Poetic worth is never dependent on sheer quantity, contrary to what Stalin once said about the quality of his armed forces arrayed against Hitler ('quantity has a quality all its own'); Poetic value depends on importance,interest, stimulability, and depth of exploration.  Too much poetry published these days is a pretty pond a mile wide and an inch deep. Gjertrud invites us to probe the depths off shore while heading to the surface for appropriate breathing stops. The final merit of a body of poetry is: will it stand the test of time and be referred to again and again, still speaking fresh and anew to each generation as many of the above-mentioned masters. I would suggest that 'Supernatural Love', her most powerful poem to date, achieves the following standard: efficient and effective symbiosis between form, sound, imagery, theme, motion, emotion, thought, music, substance, color, tone, texture, connotatively rich rhyming and spiritual importance. In this magnificent masterpiece, all aspects of poetry cross-pollinate each other in a mysterious, indefinable perichoresis(mutual interpenetration and enhancement creating a whole greater than the mere sum of parts). They are inseparable and,as here displayed, prove that a good poem cannot be said in any other way in any other words.  Bravo! A tour de force to be welcomed on all new-formalist poetry shelves.	2000-11-18

Here is what former publisher Henry Holt had to say in 1945: &quot;In recent years, Stanley Kunitz has become recognized as one of the most original and thoughtful of our newer poets. His work is not simple, but mature, directly spoken and vigorous.&quot; The same could be said now 55 years later. Here is a morsel to whet the appetite:<br />An agitation of the air, A perturbation of the light<br />Admonished me the unloved year Would turn on its hinge that night.<br />I stood in the disenchanted field Amid the stubble and the stones Amazed, while a small worm lisped to me The song of my marrow-bones.<br />Blue poured into summer blue, A hawk broke from his cloudless tower, The roof of the silo blazed, and I knew That part of my life was over.<br />Already the iron door of the north Clangs open: birds, leaves, snows Order their populations forth, And a cruel wind blows.<br />Older than Thomas Hardy (87) or Robert Frost (88) when still writing and publishing quality poetry (now 95 and counting), this is over half a century of incredible textures, tones, colors,imagery, metaphor, soulful expression in stirring lines making what Yeats called &quot;words set to life's music&quot;.

Ironically, all the authors commit multiple Exegetical Fallacies (see D.A.Carson's illuminating book) due to 'out of control' Control Beliefs. 1)Open theism takes texts woodenly literal that historically, justifiably in context are anthropologic or metaphoric; 2)God is in the details, but only 'skeletally', not 'fleshed-out' due to the free ranging of demonic,angelic,<br />human free-exercise clause in God's contract with Earth's latitude/longitude (it almost seems the devil is in more details than God is allowed to be!); 3)Much of open theism seems overreaction to hypercalvinism,ultra-determinism,contrived caricature of 'Classical' theism as meticulously sovereign, fatalistic,decreeing/ordaining all reality exhaustively,etc. but substituting one extreme theism in lieu of another is equally problematic; 4)Omniscience must be redefined, or at least the nature of what God can know and when He can know it: 'certainly not the future free actions of moral beings as definite in advance'(thus not the present free actions either, since that would render them just as unfree as future ones); 5)The 'unknowable'in a finite/mortal sense (exhaustive, definite future free decisions/destinies in detail) is claimed to be just as unknowable in infinite/immortal sense, even to Omniscience;  6)Thus, God cannot be truly Omnipresent, for He cannot inhabit a non-existent future; God's presence, formerly omniwhere/when, omnithere/then, omnihere/now is likewise redefined as excluding the future(and any yet-to-be past i.e. present?); 7) Election, pre-determining,ordaining,fore-ascertaining passages are re-interpreted corporately, never individually (except Messianic) to preserve self-determination Control Belief; 8)Multiple passages are unduly labeled 'prophecy' when apparently,in context not so in the strict sense of irrevocable,unconditional  'must come to pass':Nineveh, Hezekiah, Jeremiah, etc. are most likely conditional warnings, proclamations,pronouncements depending on a response from the audience where consequences are revealed in advance, not the actual responses-to-be; 9)It is not possible for God to be caught off guard as it were, since He knows all future possibilities and their probabilities. But how can He know genuine possibilities before their antecedent decision sets or action triggers occur is beyond knowing: you can't truly predict/forecast tomorrow's weather without observing today's weather headed this way;likewise, how could God predict possible human decisions, like pond ripples, until all the real pebbles have been freely tossed into the relevant pond creating genuine forecastable possibilities? How can a chess grandmaster know which possibles he should bother preparing for until the mortal opponents actually initiate a real decision sequence of free moves creating possibilities to be countered? The list goes on as to Biblical, philosophical, logical, credible, statistical incoherence of open theism, all because of unproven,untenable Control Beliefs that don't square with Scripture's Control Beliefs.	2000-10-05

Books	5	0	3	N	N	God Created Man in His Image: Openness Returns Compliment	Cogent and persuasive refutation of 'free will'theism. Much food for thought for both sides of the issue. Makes excellent observation of Control Beliefs' determinant influence on presuppositions,regardless of contrary data. Openness premises in, openness out(no surprise there!) Of course the same could be said for Classical position. Granted. The point is: which presumptions are most plenarily biblical, not selectively (Is God tenseless, or tensed or somehow both? Is God timeless, bound by time or both? Is God transcendent, immanent, or both? What can God know about the future and when can He know it? Can God timelessly operate in time?) Which premises are most tenable and Scripturally demanded? Which do the authors of the Bible themselves presume or intend to convey to the interpreter?  Suggestion for future editions: a few more concrete citations from Scripture, such as Elijah's prophecy/Hazael's anointing (1Ki.19:15-17), Elisha's Tears re Hazael's anti-Israel destiny (2Ki.8:7-15; 10:32; 13:2-7; Hosea 13:16). God specifically tells Elijah to anoint Hazael as king of Aram to judge/punish Israel. Many years later, Elisha prophesies to Hazael about his master king Ben-Hadad's death in detail, then weeps as God reveals to him the evil Hazael will surely do to Israel's young men, infants, pregnant women in brutal conquest. The problem for open theism: how did the Lord know all this, plan for it, arrange for it to freely occur, predict and prophesy it and ascertain these definite future facts in advance to both Elijah and Elisha? Could God appoint and anoint Hazael to freely do what he was definitely foreknown to voluntarily carry out as God's certain instrument of judgment to lead Israel to repentance? Why anoint and declare as certain, surely, definitely, precisely if there was any 'openness','risk of unfulfillment','indefiniteness', 'partial unsettledness' about these detailed matters or if there was any chance for them not to occur just as God said they must? In fact, God got His two big prophets both involved in the anointing and prophecy as if to double-guarantee the outcome! Also, the fact Elisha was weeping seems to indicate a settled reality to quite a level of detail. Real tears reflect genuine,definite future reality/certainty, otherwise the show of emotion is premature overdramatics for only an 'open possibility' vs. a real, gut-wrenching reaction to a vivid, definite certainty. A plain, literal reading of these texts doesn't seem to allow for hypothetical, potential, possibility, maybe/maybe not, perhaps, 'one option among many' or worst case scenario forecast that may have turned out differently (Jesus' bloody sweat/tears in Gethsemane also reflect a settled knowledge/consent/will of God). Here is a certain, literal, definite, specific, foreknown future individual destiny/decision set prophesied and anointed by God many years in advance (first through Elijah, then years later thru Elisha) and precisely fulfilled in vivid, graphic detail which Elisha was given a foreglimpse of eliciting real tears of genuine grief over a definitely ascertainted future. More biblical examples like this would have strengthened this otherwise outstanding defense of Biblical Omnitheism, refuting the 'openness deity' of penultimacy,quasi-eternity,multi-presence, pseudo-omniscience posited by some.	2000-10-05

However, not much new news here. Any real progress in the debate will only come from full acknowledgement of Control Beliefs used to evaluate the evidence all have access to. Is Genesis 1-3 literal or not? Are six days of Creation literal or not? Was there really a worldwide flood or was it only a 'local, tranquil flood' in Mesopotamia? What insight does the book of Job, the Psalms and New Testament shed on the interpretation of Genesis? Equally important, in case of conflict between 'scientific conclusions' such as age of universe, big bang cosmology,evolutionary theories and a literal, plain sense Genesis, which controls? Is the Bible authoritative or 'science'? Once this epistemological issue is faced squarely about validity of presuppositions, and whether Genesis or Genetics is in the driver's seat for data interpretation, perhaps genuine progress can be made to properly evaluate the different views such as Special Creation in six 24 hour days, Progressive Creation, Gap Theory (Re-creation), Theistic Evolution, Darwinian Evolution, Punctuated Equilibrium, Panspermia, or other 'creative' combinations. Genesis seems to have the advantage of Divine Inspiration, while many of today's interpretations (Hugh Ross, et al) are Imaginative or Intellectual perhaps at the expense of being Holy Spirit-Illuminative. All the facts point to the greater need for much more faith in the Creator and His infallible account of when and how He did what He did.	2000-10-05

Those readers or reviewers who feel that the author should stop at Genesis in advocating the evidence for Intelligent Design fail to realize that Jesus Himself is that Intelligent Designer. The Hebrew God of Genesis, it turns out, has a Son named Immanuel. To omit reference to the Father&amp; Son universal design and construction team is to do injustice to what Francis Schaeffer called 'True Truth'. The Father's genius is the Son's genius; the Father's architecture is the Son's; the Father's handiwork is Jesus'. The Gospel of John, especially Chapter 1 and Revelation make that abundantly clear. Without the LOGOS, the WORD of God, Jesus Christ, there would be no Genesis, no Intelligent Design, no DNA, no mankind, those 'suspended between two infinities' (Pascal) of the microscope and telescope. Hebrews Ch.1 proclaims Jesus as the One Who holds all creation together with the Word of God's power. Christ - the Power of God and Wisdom of God! This book makes no apology for proclaiming Jesus as the Author of all existence Who rose from the dead and will return as Judge of His creation. In the meantime, acknowledging Him as LORD is the wisest and most logical, sensible, cogent course of action. Must reading for supernaturalists, naturalists and all in between! But don't just take Johnson's word for it. Check out the New Testament evidence for yourself. See Lee Strobel's compelling Case for Christ and Case for Faith to further your pilgrimage, where spiritual facts and faith and scientific facts and faith are integrated into LOGOSOPHY, the wisdom of the Word of the God Who spoke and worlds leapt into existence.	2000-10-05

The one strength of this book - exposing many of process thought's incoherences and unbiblical concepts (which can't help but make 'free-will theism' more palatable by comparison!) - is overshadowed by multiple deficiences of exegesis, theology, philosophy, logic, Control Beliefs(epistemology), Biblical adherence. The main problem seems to be an almost 'theistic evolution' concept: but the novelty is that instead of applying to creation, it here applies to no less than the Creator Himself! He too is evolving, progressing, in transition (changing as it becomes virtuous to do so), growing to be all He can be along with His evolving,in process creatures. This innovative conclusion arises from authors'Control Beliefs. These constitute interpretive grids, faith filters,believability indices, possibility parameters, internal discriminators, thought templates that are instinctively, involuntarily activated in the mind which generate values, paradigms, a priori presuppositions that adjudicate and arbitrate data gathering, processing, assimilation. They act as 'contact lenses' through which life is viewed and interpreted. Of course while wearing them, we don't see them; it's much easier to see what we perceive others are wearing. These non-objective (or partially at best) lenses inform us as to what is tenable or untenable; welcome or unwelcome; acceptable or not; tolerable, intolerable; logical/Biblical or not; friend or foe; true(as perceived) or untrue. With theological interpretation and formulation, Control Beliefs - our lenses - not only shape/shade what theories and beliefs we want to hold, but what evidence we will even be 'open' to in the first place; how much weight we attach to data; how we define terms and formulate conclusions; how we compare/contrast and analyze what is perceived to be Biblical,factual, logical, valid. (The old saying: 'We are entitled to our opinions, but no one has the right to be wrong with the facts.') All too often our Control Beliefs orbit around a few selective concepts integrated into our thinking patterns/grid from experiences, education,intellectual exposures, personality, influences (Holy Spirit, evil spirits, self-deceptive inner spirit).The authors' Control Beliefs are not documented,discussed, evaluated,compared for plausibility or correspondence with Biblical facts. It is tacitly assumed that their lenses are clear,20/20,unwarped, unfogged,uncolored,objective,correct universal prescription vis a vis opponents' lenses. Until this is addressed, no genuine dialogue seems possible with historically evangelical positions, since all the 'proof texting' or citation of witnesses or evidence will be automatically skewed or distorted by the sincere,but sincerely wrong undisclosed and unrecognized Control Beliefs, lenses 'seen through without being seen'. Neither  'process' nor 'openness' Control Beliefs align with the inspired divinely corrected lenses of the Biblical authors when all Scriptural data are considered in a balanced,plenary way. As long as process or openness Control Beliefs continue to control Biblical Control Beliefs (inaccurately and selectively drawn or eisegeted from 'friendly' texts), philosophy - whether Aristotle or Whitehead or Hartshorne or Hasker,et al; logic and extra-biblical lensing will retain a controlling and magisterial role viz.Scripture's controlled, ministerial role.

Lee Strobel's investigative and journalistic expertise are once again brought to bear in another outstanding book. The interview style is very engaging and makes the book leap to life with each chapter. He has definitely hit upon the 'hot buttons' of Christianity which have turned some away from following Christ, intimidated others from considering His merits, and led still others to dismiss the New Testament out of hand as either philosophically, intellectually or emotionally unsatisfying. This book does a masterful job of reaching out to all three in a winsome, cogent, thorough approach.  When read in conjunction with books such as D.James Kennedy's Bible Mysteries; Josh McDowell's Evidence That Demands a Verdict; C.S.Lewis Mere Christianity and recent volumes on Intelligent Design (Behe, et al), the Case for Faith in not only the God of Genesis but the God of the New Testament (In the beginning was the WORD) is established by a preponderance of the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt!

Just as there is tremendous opposition to  contrary views in the Darwinian community of non-theistic evolution, so  there seems to be strong intolerance among many who are convinced science  holds the key to interpreting/understanding Genesis. This welcome book  challenges the fossilized position of Billions of Years, Progressive  Creationism, Gap Theory, etc. held by Hugh Ross and others who look at  nature as the 67th book of the Bible. The author doesn't claims to have all  the answers, but posits some ideas to consider for further research that  allow science to be harmonized with Genesis rather than vice versa. No  matter your presuppositions(science proves. . . or Scripture proves. . .),  this book will hopefully compel re-examination of preconceived theories  about origins, starlight, apparent age, and add to the evidence for young  earth/solar system clocks or recent creation markers such as Gentry's work  with 'decay haloes', Steve Austin's Mt.St. Helen/Grand Canyon geologic  research, and the recent Ballard discoveries in the Black Sea of  antediluvian civilization as likely support for a 7,000 yr. old 'more than  merely local flood'.

Josh is one of this generation's foremost apologists for the Christian  faith, having begun his journey in college as a skeptic himself setting out  to disprove the Bible. To his amazement, the evidence was overwhelming and  'demanded a verdict'. The vast range of source material cited (and updated  for new audiences) from personal research and extensive Scriptural and soul  searching have produced a monumental one-volume arsenal to defend the faith  in a friendly but firmly factual way. This belongs in every church library  and should be read by every church member to re-examine the documentary  evidence for believing in Christ: there is no need to apologize for  accepting the Bible at face value, since it has never been disproven and  the preponderance of the evidence points to its truthfulness beyond a  reasonable doubt. Great companion books would be Lee Strobel's Case For  Christ; Case For Faith; C.S. Lewis Mere Christianity; Norman Geisler When  Critics Ask; D.James Kennedy Solving Bible Mysteries.

Anything he relates about his  50+ year walk of faith in Christ resonates with authenticity and stimulates  life change in all who encounter his sold-out discipleship.(See Campus  Crusade and Jesus Film websites for truly global impact of the influence of  this one obedient servant of the Lord Jesus). This book is a welcome  addition to re-establish the wonderful character of God from a Biblical  perpective in the minds/hearts of this and future generations. The  modern,minority movement to challenge the historical, evangelical  understanding of God's character/attributes needs this bracing reminder of  just Who this Majestic God really is. He is there; He has not changed; He  is not silent. He will not countenance theological speculators, like Job's  friends, to pontificate 'free-will/openness theism' theories. &quot;Your  friends have not spoken of Me what is right&quot;, God warned (Job 42:7).  In fact, a re-reading of Job 36-41 along with this volume will do wonders  to add the proper magnification factor to our day and age which makes a  deity too small while making the human too big, recreating a god in its  image. True logosophy (Wisdom of the Written/Incarnate Word) consists of  what may be called Omnitheism - allowing God to be all Scripture says He is  without finite, logical, mortal constraints. Biblical Theism - the Whole,  Scripturally revealed Triune God Who is All in All, greater than the mere  sum of His attributes, titles, names, character traits; Alpha and Omega, I  AM that I AM. The God of All Possibles and All Impossible within scriptural  bounds. What Omnitheism is NOT: pantheism (God is all, all is God;  one-to-one Creator to creature correlation); NOT panentheism (God is in  all, all is in God; one-to-one extension of identity/being or reality;  Creator contained within the creation); NOT process theism (God is  evolving, becoming all He can be - in process); NOT openness/free-will  theism (God is all He can logically, rationally,  finitely-reasoned,philosophically , possibly be; subject to, not sovereign  over, contingencies of created free will, a deity who changes when it is  virtuous to change and can add to his knowledge base what cannot be known  about future free events, etc.) All of these pseudo-theisms limit God and  His attributes and character. Deity is reduced to multi-present,  penultimate, finite, quasi-eternal, almost omniscient. This is what happens  when reason is exalted in formulation of Control Beliefs over Scripture;  exegesis unwittingly becomes eisegesis, and thus a distorted deity emerges.  Biblical omnitheism describes God as All He truly is and is able to be  finitely described to limited human understanding. We are bound by the  Scriptural dictate, &quot;Do not go beyond what is written&quot;. What is  genuine mystery must remain mystery. Omnitheism is NOT a God Who is  everything/anything anyone can ascribe to Him or imagine Him to conceivably  be. It's allowing Scripture to speak for Him and reveal just Who He is.  After all, the Bible is itself a limited, partial, excerptive portrayal of  an Unlimited, Complete, Transcriptive God. While He retains the right to  transcend or exceed Biblical description, we assume not in any  internally-contradictory, irrational, absurd,unGodlike way inconsistent  with His Personhood, Character and what limited Biblical witness we  possess. This excellent book belongs in the hands of every thoughtful  person, Christian or not.

One can't help but celebrate the reaching of a skeptical dad by a bold,  thoughtful son; that's what is so arresting about this book. But it also  seems to be a platform to espouse a clearly deficient, quasi-biblical view  called 'free-will' or 'open' theism.Just one illustration will show how  free 'free-will' is and how open or ajar the future is. If God cannot know  future free decisions as definite in advance without impinging on genuine  'free exercise clause' of human destinies, how can God know even Present  free decisions as definite as they are breaking, transpiring without the  same potential infringement? Even Present free destinies passing,  happening, occurring, opting, deciding cannot be definitely known until  they are already passed, happened, occurred, opted, decided, finalized,  over, done, in the record books, etched in the fixed Past where even God's  knowledge cannot affect them, since only at THAT time (done, past tense,  chosen, fully decided) will free agency not be negated. Since what God  definitely knows about any future destiny fixes that destiny, so too with  any present destiny until it is freely fixed by the decider as Past. Thus,  God cannot even know a yet-to-be-Past, i.e. Present, for all the Present is  is a membrane converting Future to Past. If genuine freedom of action is  the issue, then God's omniscience not only must exclude definite,  exhaustive individual FUTURE decisions, but PRESENT (not-yet-Past) as well.  Example: God cannot definitely know that Free Freda will drink from a blue,  8 oz. glass of ice water with 3 ice cubes at 9:07am PST next Wednesday. For  Him to do so means Freda is not truly free to do otherwise. Thus all He  'forecasts' is she may or may not possibly do so.By the same token, God  cannot definitely know that Freda will drink the same glass of icewater in  the next 60 seconds. He can see her thoughts and thirst and her going to  the kitchen, opening cupboard, pulling out the blue glass, opening freezerfor the ice cube tray. But since even Free Freda doesn't at this precise  moment know how many (or just which) ice cubes she will select; or maybe  will drop one; or maybe ice cube tray is empty; or how full she will fill  the glass; or how many times she will refill - even God cannot know (except  see inside the freezer the half-empty tray Freda can't see until she opens  the door) these breaking events until they are fully, finally completed.  Freda, to be fully free, must will, decide, choose, act completely (she  must be DONE) in her sequence, at her discretion, leisure, timing,  duration, pace BEFORE God can definitely know each/any step and the entire  sequence to preserve Freda's genuine self-determination, latitude of  destiny. As long as Freda IS DRINKING, God cannot know how things will turn  out until she is DONE DRINKING,past tense. Everything is still open  possibility, probabilities, part settled/part unsettled until Free Freda  eliminates all Open Future from her Open Present by creating a non-open,  settled Past. Then, and only then, can God know it as definite and leave  her open to create her own destiny freely. Until free-will theism can  resolve this internal incoherency (among multiple others too numerous to  mention here), it's best to look to Norman Geisler's Creating God in Man's  Image; Millard Erickson's God the Father Almighty; Paul Helm's Eternal God;  and excellent essays on BGC's 'Foreknowledge' website for more Biblically  plausible description of Omnitheism: God is All the Bible says He is; no  less; no reductionism; no quasi-omniscience, etc.	2000-09-14

Crosses are everywhere: Jewelry, Tattoos, Bumperstickers, church  ornamentation, artwork, etc. Almost so commonplace as to be trivialized.  This welcome book reminds us just what the Cross was all about: the awesome  price the Lord of Glory paid on our behalf to satisfy the justice of God.  It wasn't nails that held Jesus on the Cross, but His great love for us and  obedience to the Father. But the nails, the wounds, the bloodletting, the  scourging, the tortuous thirst, the splinters, the agonizing rejection, the  humiliation, the full attacks of Satan, the suffocation, the forsakenness -  all were part of a very human, very evil conspiracy, kangaroo court, mock  trial and miscarried justice: Murder in the Supreme Degree! Yet what evil  made into Wicked Friday, God turned Good: Sunday was coming! &quot;I will  rise again&quot;. This book is a solemn reminder of just how serious it is  to neglect, downplay, overlook,fail to appreciate, take for granted  Christ's work of redemption. A rereading of Hebrews would wonderfully  supplement this work, as well as Lee Strobel's Case For Christ, where  forensic medical interviews are conducted to detail the horrors of Roman  crucifixion. You will never be the same after reading this book -  prayerfully, reflectively, humbly, gratefully.	2000-09-10

The more I read Norman Geisler, the more I am impressed by his solid  scholarship, evangelical heart and thoughtful mind. He is an excellent  communicator and consistently produces books of high quality. This is no  exception. While not intended to be an exhaustive treatment of Bible  Difficulties, there is enough here to satisfy most students, skeptics,  scholars, seekers and sages.  My edition had a few minor areas of suggested  correction which future editions may consider:1) Gen.1:14 - 'the sun may  have existed from the first day'. Gen.1:16-18 indicate sun, moon and stars  were MADE on Day 4, not just 'became visible'. Perhaps a stronger argument  that God created disorganized light on Day 1 and confined it to its new  sources on Day 4. Or God Himself, Who lives in unapproachable Light may  have been the original light-source. To say sun/moon/stars existed from Day  1 seems contradictory to the Biblical record. 2)Gen 1:26 reference to  Trinity. Doesn't Gen.3:22 settle the matter 'like ONE OF US'? Clearly not  majestic plural like Queen Victoria saying 'we are not amused'. 3)Gen.2 -  how could trees created 'grow'? They were mature from the get-go, seed and  fruit-bearing from Day 3. God did not create seeds, saplings, but mature  adult trees ready to reproduce. There is also a peculiar reference to 'went  to sleep' twice, when Adam only slept once during Eve's creation. 4) The  bible doesn't say that when Cain killed Abel, that only Adam and Eve were  left. v.14-17 indicate 'whoever finds me', thus there were other  brothers/sisters/relatives around who might take vengeance. If Cain/Abel  were late teens or early 20's, would Eve be barren for that long having no  other offspring until Seth? Seth wasn't born until Adam was 130; presumably  Cain/Abel were born much earlier, plenty of time for lots of siblings, etc.  5) Gen.6:2 'sons of God' never used in Scripture of evil angels/demons.  They must either be good angels (not likely here) or good(believing,  God-fearing) people. 6) Gen.19:30-38 Noah is mentioned; should be Lot. 7)  Deut.1:6 'large number of women present'? Women were just as guilty as men  and also excluded by unbelief from Promised Land. Ex.14:1 'ALL the people  of the community', 'ALL the Israelites grumbled','WHOLE assembly', 'wicked  community' does not exclude women. Perhaps some were spared as Joshua/Caleb  or Rahab, etc. but no mention of 'large number of women'. 8) 2Sam.12:23  &quot;all infants go to heaven&quot;? Isn't this bordering on universalism  or 'innocent age of accountability' (cf.Ro.1,3,11:32)? Are  stillbirths/abortions, etc. automatic tickets to heaven? Scripture doesn't  say. We must trust God's mercy and righteousness. There is no biblical  'justification by death', only 'by faith in Christ'. We know God will do  the right thing with every unborn soul. 9) 2Ki.2:23-24 'Fifth, it was not  Elijah' should be Elisha. 10) 2Ki.20:11 when Hezekiah asks for the shadow  to go backwards on the staircase(the earth stops rotating on its axis and  actually reverses its rotation under God's miraculous suspension of the  laws of celestial mechanics without tidal, weather, catastrophic  cosmic/earthly consequences).That this wasn't some mere local phenomenon or  'smoke and mirrors or shadow tricks', see 2Chr.32:31 for worldwide effect  and Babylonian envoy sent to check things out direct from the source. These  will suffice as some of the minor issues that could use further addressing.  Otherwise, an outstanding addition to the apologetic arsenal.	2000-09-10

If you're looking for a finite,  multi-present, penultimate, quasi-eternal, reductionist deity, you've come  to the right place. No matter your position on process or openness or  free-will theism, as Clark Pinnock once said, 'theological novelty and a  high view of Biblical authority do not fit well together'. 'use of process  thought cannot be explained in terms of Biblical reflection, but in terms  of the influence of secular modernity.' What God hath been wrought?	2000-09-10

Clear, concise, compelling affirmation of just what constitutes saving  faith in Scripture. A powerful follow-up volume to Gospel According to  Jesus. Because of the rampant confusion in today's church/society regarding  the Gospel, this book is a welcome addition to the contra-easy-believism  arsenal.  In equation form, the book can be summarized: Faith=  Salvation+Works. Not to be confused with what some perceive:  Faith+Works=Salvation. Also defines the nature of what is included as a  precondition for true faith:Repentance. Not just a change of mind about Who  Jesus is; not just sorrow or remorse over sin or recognition of need, but  U-turn, 180 degree about face turning from sin and turning to Christ. Tony  Evans says it best: You're driving South on the interstate, going the wrong  way, away from God. Take the next exit/off-ramp - repentance!. Take the  overpass of grace and head for the next on-ramp going North -  restoration/recovery! Now, merge onto the interstate by the Holy Spirit's  power heading North as a disciple following Jesus to the Father. That's  Biblical Repentance, Saving Faith and Discipleship. If there is a Root,  there must be Fruit. No Fruit? No Root! Excellent resource for Sunday  School, Home Groups, personal study.	2000-09-10

Read in conjunction with Behe's Intelligent Design; C.S.  Lewis Mere Christianity; Ken Ham Answers In Genesis; Henry Morris Genesis  Flood; Hank Hanegraaf Farce of Evolution; Lee Strobel Case For Faith; James  Kennedy Solving Bible Mysteries - all will open the mind to other options  that can't help but lead to new personal insight and growth. This book does  a great service to challenge his audience to renewed vigor in critical  thinking skills and to examine all the evidence - religious, historical as  well as scientific. Metaphysics seems to hold the key to the validity of  evolution as a viable theory into the 21st Century. Let the research and  further investigation continue!	2000-09-09

There is sufficient evidence in DNA, cellular  structure, biochemistry, immunology, et al - all irrefutable, tacit  testimony to irreducible complexity in our universe on the macro and micro  scales that point to one verdict: Life is the result (and ongoing  testimony) to Genius-level design, architecture, engineering, manufacture,  quality control even to the level of molecular self-repair.  Death, decay,  aging, disease and entropy remain the enigmas they have always been,  forcing the thoughtful, reflective searcher to spiritual inquiry and  investigation, often leading to the Old and New Testaments, where plausible  answers are provided. This book, read in conjunction with Lee Strobel's  Case For Faith; James Kennedy's Solving Bible Mysteries and C.S. Lewis Mere  Christianity and Hank Hanegraaf's Farce of Evolution make a pretty  compelling bridge between Religious Faith and Scientific Faith, Religious  Fact and Scientific Fact.

The conclusion that keeps arising from these  diverse areas of inquiry is that the universe we inhabit seems to have been  prepared, designed, arranged for our habitation by something or Someone.  DNA can now stand for Design: Nature's Architecture. Architecture demands  Architect. The Hebrew God has a pretty convincing claim to the title that  has yet to be refuted archaeologically, historically, scientificly. There  are no other serious contenders to the role of Super-Genius Engineer based  on the growing evidence of irreducible complexity, meticulous  micro-organization of not just information, but living information. This  book read along with research of Answers in Genesis website (AIG) and Lee  Strobel's Case For Faith will expand the reader's horizons to new avenues  of satisfying truth.	2000-09-09

Continues the great tradition of helping Bible students,  seekers, skeptics, sages and saints wrestle with genuine and apparent Bible  mysteries that have puzzled thoughtful readers for centuries. This book  places Kennedy in the all-time great apologist list including C.S.Lewis,  Josh McDowell, John MacArthur, Hank Hanegraaf, Walter Martin, R.C. Sproul,  Norman Geisler and more recently Lee Strobel. Dr. Kennedy is wise to  maintain mystery where Scripture does not reveal complete information to  resolve; but where genuine progress can be made to understand apparent  contradictions, doctrinal dichotomy, paradox, antinomy, this resource  provides fresh material for resolution as far as humanly possible. Although  obviously a scholar with a penetrating intellect, Dr. Kennedy keeps the  conversation practical and down to earth for a wide audience. The goal is  not merely information for the mind, but transformation of the heart and  edification of the soul. This book achieves all three. It would make a  great gift for searching friends who have sincere doubts about the Bible,  but it also pulls no punches about the more troubling, difficult truths  that need to be faced squarely and reflectively.  Well done! Another  must-read addition to the personal library!	2000-09-09

A wake-up call for the Whole  Church to take the Whole Gospel to the Whole World. With razor-sharp  insight, 'carefrontational' style and vivid personal illustrations and  true-life stories, this book comes alive with every chapter, both  afflicting the comfortable and comforting the afflicted. A pervasive  undertone throughout the book seems to be echoes of Matt.25: &quot;I was  hungry, you gave me something to eat; thirsty, you gave me something to  drink; naked, you clothed me; stranger, you invited me in; sick, you  ministered to me; I was in prison, you visited me . . . Whatever you did  for the least of these brothers of mine, you did for Me.&quot; Christianity  that does not make a measurable, day-to-day, redemptive impact on  individuals in spiritual/physical need is not worthy of the name of Christ.  For society to be reclaimed,restored, renewed, individuals must be; for  that to happen, the church must be revived one pew, one pulpit at a time.  The challenge goes out to all churches and their leaders and members and  attenders: GET INVOLVED IN MERCY MINISTRY TODAY: MENTORING, ANGEL TREE,  PRISON VISITATION, VOLUNTEERING. Making a difference for eternity is truly  the only fulfilling pursuit of a Biblical Christian. Try it today and see  how God blesses your faithful delivery of Jesus' grace to a hurting planet.

You can't have one without the  other. Recent contemporary attempts to finitize or downgrade what God  supposedly can or can't do or know (such as open theism's deity who cannot  have meticulous, definite, exhaustive, in toto, micro/macro knowledge of  future free actions without rendering their decisions involuntary) need to  re-examine their processistic preconceptions and compare them with the  competition for inherent plausibility and faithfulness to the biblical  record. Also, downgrading one attribute of God such as Omniscience  automatically affects other attributes (Omnipotence, Omnipathy,  Omnipresence, Omniwisdom) and His Whole Person. 'Tweaking one tweaks all'.  This book, in conjunction with Millard Erickson's God the Father  Almighty,and Paul Helm's Eternal God, is a must read!	2000-09-08

The author  does a splendid job of keeping philosophy in its proper ministerial place  while allowing Scripture its rightful magisterial position in shaping  truth. True ideas have truthful consequences; false ideas also have  truthful consequences, which sometimes are like ideological gravity:  painful landings without a biblically informed parachute! Napoleon was  right: 'the pen is mightier than the sword',or as Solomon said: 'as a man  thinketh, so is he'.

Afflicts the comfortable and  comforts the afflicted. Many great points are made about not taking God  'cafeteria style', picking and choosing which attributes we like or prefer,  but taking the Whole God as He is and always will be. He is not just  Omni-love or Omnipotent or Omni-immanent; He is not just Omni-holy,  Omni-sovereign, Omni-transcendent. The Biblical God is a perfect synthesis  of all His attributes, infinitely greater than any human sum of His  qualities/character traits. He is, humanly speaking, Omni-Supreme Being -  Divine - Trinity - Holy - Love - Powerful - Wise - Merciful - Immanent -  Transcendent - Sovereign, ad infinitum. Any other God, especially the  recent open theism deity of 'limited foreknowledge, multi-present,  quasi-eternal,penultimate, finite-to-limits-of-logic', is not worthy of  worship.	2000-09-08

A powerful resource supporting literal reading/understanding of Genesis,  Special Creation, rendering all competing theories, especially theistic  evolution, quasi-creation views as on the verge of extinction Biblically,  coherently, logically, exegetically, even scientifically (note the recent  upsurge in Design, Irreducible Complexity, etc.) Fully endorsed by Dr.  Henry Morris, Dr. John Morris, Dr. Duane Gish of Institute of Creation  Research (see ICR website) and Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis (see AIG  website). Takes issue with compromisers and theistic evolutionists like  Hugh Ross of Reasons to Believe. While an otherwise sincere, evangelical  Christian ministry, this book gently but firmly recommends re-evaluation of  using finite scientific understanding to adjudicate Genesis issues (length  of Biblical days: 24 hours as historically, even Hebraicly understood, or  long periods/eons/evolutionary ages); warns against overdependence on  astrophysics, paleogeology, humanistic interpretation of fossil evidence;  embracing of local flood theory vs. literal, plain sense worldwide  cataclysm mentioned even by Jesus and Peter in New Testament. Author does  not attempt to dogmatically posit Young Earth, Recent Special Creation as  the only way to go: this is an 'in-house' debate needing more Biblical and  scientific (ICR,AIG) research. But it seems clear that letting Genesis be  defined by science vs. vice versa is dishonoring to Scripture and the  Creator.

A powerful, much needed book to help the Whole Church carry the Whole  Gospel to the Whole World. We are saved by 100% Grace and also 100% Faith.  Unbelieved grace, or believed pseudo-grace are equally deficient, both of  which are rampant in the church today. This helpful volume gets to the root  of the confusion and marshalls a full battery of Biblical ammo to attack  all humanistic competition to the true Gospel of Jesus. The true Gospel  must afflict the comfortable before it can comfort the afflicted.  Repentance is critical to saving faith, without which no one can inherit  the Kingdom. Mathematically, the Biblical formula is NOT:  Faith+Works=Salvation; rather it is: Faith=Salvation+Works. The Root of  Faith in Christ can't help but produce Fruit of Grace through Christ. No  Fruit?

Lewis)	More appropriately titled, 'Journey toward Newness/Novelty'. The main  strength of the book is to show how subtly, gradually and unwittingly a  journey away from evangelical core beliefs can be for anyone, no matter the  intellectual horsepower or academic credentials or sincerity.  Compare/contrast prior Pinnock quotes (1985 - How I Use the Bible in Doing  Theology) with his current position (still evolving, progressing,  'renewing', 'maturing'): &quot;theological novelty does not blend well with  a high view of Scripture&quot; &quot;adherence to the Bible means  acquiescence to all its teachings and a refusal to allow any rival to stand  above it, whether tradition, reason, culture, science, opinion&quot;  &quot;the theologian has no right to pick and choose between biblical  doctrines&quot; &quot;reductionism has no rightful role in theology, nor is  there a right to place in opposition one part of the Bible against another.  I simply presuppose its falsity on the grounds of my confidence in  scripture, the inspiration of which carries an assumption of its unity and  coherence&quot; &quot;each text must be read and understood in the  canonical context which resists an atomistic approach&quot; &quot;we must  not conform theology to our situation&quot; &quot;use of process thought  cannot be explained in terms of biblical reflection but must be explained  in terms of the influence of secular modernity&quot; &quot;What divine  revelation does not disclose cannot be incorporated into theology as truth.  Only what is taught in Scripture is binding on the conscience&quot;  &quot;the wise theologian accepts the tensions which are present in the  Bible and learns to resist the temptation from reason to tamper with them.  I cannot tamper with the data as regards sovereignty and human freedom just  because it would be easier if one were at liberty to do so&quot;  &quot;Reason is a God-given faculty which is of great usefulness in  theology; however, it must be kept in itsministerial role and not allowed  to rise to a magisterial role&quot;<br />&quot;tradition (the living faith of  the dead, as opposed to traditionalism, the dead faith of the living)  provides contexts in which Scriptural knowledge is pursued&quot;  &quot;Tradition in its servant role alerts theologians to heresy&quot;  Prooftexting is suspect because &quot;when the Bible is cited in support of  some proposal, it must be apt, intelligent and discerning. I do not want to  be sued by Scripture for exegetical malpractice&quot; In other words,  citing texts must be done in a way that is <br />illuminant, Spirit-friendly,  plenarily representative and canonically/contextually balanced. &quot;be  wary of twisting Scripture to serve one's own interests and preferred  views&quot; &quot;theology must not attempt to advance beyond the limits of  the Bible&quot; - do not go beyond what is written! &quot;We cannot go  beyond the evidence&quot;, especially if it is where no man has gone  before, or where even angels fear to tread. &quot;We cannot invent new data  or eliminate any. We may even have to accept antinomies which offend the  rational impulse&quot;(apparent contradiction; paradox; antilogy)  &quot;Scripture may not always satisfy human curiosity which presses for  answers in areas where sufficient evidence is not provided&quot; That is,  we have all we need to know, not all we need to want to know. The wise  theologian must be careful to find even what he may not be apt to seek,  rather than seek only what he is prone to find. &quot;tradition serves to  confront heretical teachers who advance their novelties in the name of some  lost-sight-of exegetical insights&quot; &quot;A high doctrine of Scripture  and theological novelty do not go well together&quot; &quot;we are not free  to pick and choose between biblical doctrines or to perform theological  reduction that marks the shift toward humanity in religious  liberalism&quot; &quot;The biblical writers do not seem tofeel that  (divine sovereignty and human agency) are mutually exclusive, but instead  they place the two ideas in juxtaposition at every turn and seem  indifferent to our intellectual dilemmas&quot; &quot;Reason is a faculty of  great usefulness to theology. Occasionally, it rises up to challenge  Scripture and when it does, we ought to put it in its place as  supportive,ministerial, non-legislative&quot; &quot;When confronting  heresies, novelties, 'lost-sight-of exegetical insights', the creeds of the  church, though not infallible, provide temporary respite by alerting to the  time-honored convictions and conventions of multitudes of believers before  our time and make one pause before accepting innovations&quot; Even the  most well-intentioned are &quot;quite prepared for and adept at twisting  Scripture to serve their own ends; no one is immune from doing the same  thing&quot;<br />Truer words were never spoken! This biography highlights the  importance of guarding against any violation of the above principles of  using Scripture in theology. Caveat Emptor!	2000-09-07

Premise and conclusions internally, fatally flawed. Just how free is 'free-will theism? God retains the right to unilaterally override,  orchestrate, intervene. On what basis? Some very gifted, ambitious,  tyrannical,devious, sincere humans destroy the free agency/autonomy/liberty  of millions of others. What about demonic free will? Doesn't it severely  curtail, interfere with the free exercise clause in God's arrangement with  autonomous humans to self-determine their own destinies? Also, aren't  humans their own worse enemies, apparently free to choose as they please,  but not necessarily to please as they would please, or will as it would be  better/best to will? We are pre-bent by fallen, sinful, fleshly nature and  must act in accord with that nature unless the Holy Spirit intervenes.  Combine God's overriding capability at His discretion; evil, powerful  humans restricting masses of others; demonic free will in spiritual and  physical dimensions infringing on human latitude even to possession;  internal warpage,proclivity to evil and sin by  nature/automatically/involuntarily and what sort of 'Free-will' is left? A  Biblical human capacity, which is severely restricted, limited and fallen,  sinfully free to 'choose'. For example, the Holocaust happened. But first,  it was fantasized, planned, discussed, prepared, started, expanded,  worsened, escalated until the Allies with God's help ended it after 6+  years. Why anywhere along the chain of events as they moved into present  knowability even for God was there no intervention, damage control? When  Hitler first devised his evil scheme (Mein Kampf, 1923); Nazi party  formed/elected,1930's;when other masterminds recruited to actualize -  Himmler, Borman, Goebbels; when demonic activity kicked in to inspire, fuel  the fire, influence - all of which God should have had omniscient awareness  of as they broke in His 'present'; when first architect asked to draw first  concentration camp blueprints; when first gas canisters ordered for  delivery; when first Juden arrested,sent to fresh-constructed camp before  the first Jew was used as guinea pig to test the chamber of horrors, WHERE  WAS GOD? 6 years of mass murder, pleas, prayers, awareness,etc. with no  intervention when clearly able is the ultimately fatal flaw in free-will  theism premise and conclusion attempting to absolve an 'unaware god' or one  who chose not to intervene? Why no Joshua-type miracle of making the  sun/moon stand still? Confound the enemies on the battlefield with  hailstones, weather, angelic power, etc.? Instead, God seemed to allow  WWII, the Holocaust, etc., but instead of blasting Berlin like Sodom, He  raised up Churchill, Ike, Bradley, Patton, USAF,Monty, Ultra codebreaking,  Allied forces, et al to defeat nazism. There is no other cogent explanation  but that God allowed what was to be to be. If God did not want a Holocaust,  or a severely shortened,benign one (dozens, hundreds, thousands of victims  instead of 6+ million), be sure He could/should have orchestrated it. Why  not? Openness has no answer.(What Stalin did in pogroms, gulags, Siberia,  from 1924-1953 makes Holocaust look like a picnic: his quote - 'one death  is a tragedy; millions of deaths is a statistic'). Where is openness'  loving sovereignty here? Was God surprised? Unaware? Bound by 'Prime  Directive of non-interference'? Not free to intervene? Free to not  intervene? Openness founders here. Biblical conclusions not freely  discussed in this volume: 1)That evil exists and flourishes is somehow  allowed for God's good reasons and His alone; we may never know/maybe  shouldn't ask. 2)Parable of Wheat&amp;Tares: God sows sons of the Kingdom  in the Field of the World. Enemy/Satan sows sons of Evil in the same Field,  side-by-side. Yet, don't root up the tares or you'll root up the Wheat with  them. Let both grow together until the Harvest. Then, separate and judge  and administer eternal, ultimate justice - rewards and punishments.  Short-term pain for Long-term gain/glory. 3)Evil is redeemable and  reworkable and recoverable by God 4)Evil is God's biblically described  instrument (one of many) as simultaneous judgment on evildoers and  purifying/perfecting agent for saints via suffering(seemingly  unjust/unfair), temptation, testing - heat and pressure makes coal into  diamonds. What finite minds can see only for evil or no purpose, God can  develop for double, seemingly contradictory purposes. 5)In all humility,  we're dealing with Mystery, Antinomy, Paradox, Dichotomy, Antilogy not  fully resolvable here/now 6)God's perfect motives and ends  authoritatively/justly/lovingly justify even evil means to accomplish His  purposes: Joseph's brothers vs. Joseph; Satan vs. Job; Pharaoh vs. Hebrews;  Judas,Pilate,Caiaphas,Herod,Satan,Jerusalem vs. Jesus. 7)A master mechanic  can use a broken,wretched,greasy,'evil' wrench to fix the carburetor;  genius violinist can use the ax murderer's violin formerly used to  seduce/trap victims to now delight millions;God takes a fanatical,  well-intentioned foe (Saul) and converts Him in sovereign love (severe  restriction of alleged autonomy/self-determination -see the Acts account  for yourself!) into the chief of apostles, Paul. 8)Here's the Super-Genius  of God: It's one thing to defeat an enemy overwhelmingly or narrowly; it's  masterstroke to arrange for the enemy to defeat himself or contribute to  his own downfall and then turn a curse into a blessing for the enemy's  targets/intended victims. Jesus says to Saul, &quot;turn them from darkness  to light, from power of Satan to God&quot;. God used a former tool of Satan  to be a re-tooled instrument to save Satan's bound captives and turn them  to God's children! Karate/Judo uses opponents'  skill/moves/attacks/momentum/ dangerous intentions against them. A chess  Grandmaster can use the opponent's own strategy/tactics to seal his own  fate. It takes a devil and devious human agency 'freely' acting to sow a  Good Friday. It takes an Omnipotent, Omniloving, Omniscient God to reap an  Easter from the devil/evil/sinners' diabolical plot to populate heaven and  empty hell of as many souls as possible! 9)We expect 'ex bono bonum', good  from good. We also expect  'ex nihilo bonum', good from nothing. What  finite minds can't handle/expect is 'ex malo profundo bonissimum', highest  good from lowest/deepest/depravest evil.  10) Challenge to all free-willers  to search all Scripture texts that have &quot;God&quot; in the same  breath/verse as &quot;evil&quot;,&quot;trouble&quot;,  &quot;disaster&quot;,&quot;woe&quot;, &quot;punishment&quot;,  &quot;testing&quot;, &quot;judgment&quot;,&quot;curse&quot;,  &quot;wrath&quot;,&quot;calamity&quot;,&quot;destruction&quot;,&quot;total  destruction&quot;,&quot;suffering&quot; and reconcile them  fairly,plainly,literally to their selective scripture citations/imaginative  interpretations.

This effort is another  exercise in taking finite reasoning to its predictibly finite limits. The  following Biblical/'Logosophical concepts are conveniently unaddressed (or  at best inadequately/superficially):<br />1)It is not demonstrated that God  actually 'comes to know' any knowable reality vs. just 'non-perceptually  knowing' true states of affairs<br />2)Omniscience, Omnipresence, non-internal  change, Omnipathy, Omni-eternity, Omni-infinity,  Omni-immanence/transcendence are all logically, Biblically, metaphysically,  philosophically intertwined and interdependent: modifying/tweaking one  modifies/tweaks all<br />3)God can possibly be Omni-immanent while  Omni-transcendent and if so, does not need to possess sequential/successive  thought processing as if an Infinite God would need to 'process'  data<br />4)Though God is Omnipathic, He retains a non-changing internal  character (changes only external in relation to free beings)<br />5)'God  changes as it becomes virtuous to change' sounds nice and prima facie  reasonable, but an Omniperfect God would see no reason to EVER change  (internally/character-wise), since virtue is inherent in being Omni-aware,  Omni-unimprovable, Omni-uninformable ('dependent' on finite beings for  relationship, not improvement/information/increased knowledge,thus  change)<br />6)If God 'comes to know'of certain possibilities of which He was  previously unaware, He could not previously have been Omniscient<br />7)God as  Knower of all events knows them 'intuitively' (not having sensory organs or  sequential/attenuated 'perception') without having 'come to know'  them<br />8)An Omni-infinite, Omni-immanent-while-transcendent Knower's  foreknowledge of events expresses a temporal/mortal/finite knower's  recognition that certain events were known timelessly before this  time.(This need not be merely analogical or anthropological, but literally  knowable knowledge, literally foreknowable foreknowledge yet not  'foreknowledge' for God as Omni-infinite,Omni-eternal,Theochronic  Knower)<br />9)Our 'now' may be regarded as an indexical reference to the  finite knower, not to God as Omni-infinite Knower. That is, to say that God  Infinitely/Eternally/Theochronically knows 'now' does not entail that what  He knows is likewise sequentially/serially indexed. What God  Theochronically/Eternally knows are true states of affairs which are not  exclusively about either our future, our present, our past, although we  might need to express them as such on our finite space/time plane or  dimension of reality.<br />10)The usefulness of ascribing time/space to an  Omni-infinite, Omni-eternal, Omni-immanent-while-transcendent God reflects  the inevitable fact that we who speak about these matters are trapped in  space/time, but does not reflect a correspondent fact that God Himself is  so 'trapped', demarcated, definitized thereby. That is, our ideation of God  being primarily tensed and spatialized does not warrant/prove that the  Omni-eternal, Omni-infinite God is also tensed or spatialized, being  Omnipresent as well (Omni-where/when, Omni-there/then,  Omni-here/now)<br />11)Granted that it is possible for God to be  instantaneously or simultaneously or theochronically outside/beyond  time/space while inside/within time/space in relation to free beings, then  the Bible would describe Him as accomodating Himself (as Christ did in the  Incarnation) to human time/space-bound modes of communication and relation  without Himself being bound thereby. After all, Incarnation of Second  Person of the Trinity was not the  cancelling/suspending/reduction/subtraction of Deity, but the addition of  humanity to His Person (not the Father's Person or the Holy Spirit's  Person). I would welcome a new Hasker volume addressing these concepts and  their interdependent relationships to 'Christosophy'.	2000-08-31
US	50780512	R1IKOGY22MHXQ3	0310212685	532194571	Four Views on Hell	Books	1	21	90	N	N	One View of Hell - Jesus  Christ's	Since God created hell for the devil and his angels, and Jesus spoke more about the horrible, unnecessary tragedy of most people choosing to go there  than any other subject to warn humanity of its all too real finality (Matt.  25): 'outer darkness', 'weeping and gnashing of teeth', 'eternal fire',  'lake of fire', 'second death', 'eternal condemnation', 'damnation',  'tormented day and night', 'gnawed tongues in agony', regardless of the  palatability or rationality of hell, Jesus' view is the only  credible/authoritative one. C.S. Lewis books Screwtape Letters, Mere  Christianity, et al are most helpful in digesting how hell can be true  given a loving  God Who sincerely yearns for all men to be saved and come  to a knowledge of the truth. Lewis said, &quot;The gates of hell are locked  from the inside&quot;; also, &quot;During this life, men say to God 'My  will be done'; on Judgment Day, God says to those who rejected Him 'Thy  will be done.'&quot;  If people are unwilling to spend time with God on  earth, why would they want to spend eternity with Him? Hell is the only  option - complete absence of God. Those in hell basically get what they  want since Jesus and all He had to offer was spurned. Heaven is by grace,  hell is by choice. There is just enough heaven and hell on earth to choose  wisely one's eternal destiny. If you're born only once, you die twice -  physically and eternally; if you're born twice(again), you die only once,  not eternally. Whether 'lake of fire', 'outer darkness', or other Biblical  descriptors are literal, the actual reality must be infinitely worse  (weeping, gnashing, agony, eternal, torment are inadequate words to  describe the true state of affairs) otherwise God would not have gone to  such extremes as sacrificing His innocent Son Jesus on the cross to save  us. If there were another way to rescue us, or if our state of judgment  before a Holy God were not so bad after all, such valiant, self-sacrificial  efforts of agonizing torture of crucifixion for Jesus would be unnecessary.  &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that  WHOEVER should believe in Him would not perish, but have eternal life. For  God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save  the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned; whoever  does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in  the Name of God's one and only Son.&quot; (John 3:16-18) Logically,  Biblically,exegetically, grammatically, metaphysically and philosophically,  hell must be the directly proportionate alternate/opposite to heaven. What  heaven is, hell is not, except eternal/consciously/body and soul  experienced. If heaven is all Light, hell is all Darkness; if heaven is  bliss, hell is torment; if heaven is God's full Presence, hell is God's  complete absence; if heaven is rejoicing/celebrating, hell is weeping,  regretting, gnashing teeth, gnawing tongues, agonizing. Any reductionism of  hell (annihilation, temporary, purgatorized, softened, lessened, eased,  emptied via universalism, figuratized, mythologized), so too must be the  corresponding effect on heaven. Tampering with one dimension of eternity  tampers with the other. You can't counterfeit one side of Eternity's Coin  without affecting the whole coin! Human nature would crave only good news  (God's Love, Gospel, Gentle Jesus) and ignore, downplay, dispense with the  bad news (God's wrath at sin/sinners, Holiness/Justice, Judgment Day,  Accountability, Judge Jesus). Once again, the Cross intuitively and  theologically shouts otherwise at humanity with Jesus' blood and tears.  Unfortunately this book does not emphasize Jesus' View of Hell.	2000-08-30

Our era is on the threshhold of  potentially unravelling the Biblical portrait of our Whole God (He is  greater than the sum of His attributes) into a 'Reader's Digest' abridged  version of a 'kinder, gentler, user friendly god made in man's image'. What  with process thought, free-will theists and other hybrid theories partially  or radically jettisoning the historical, evangelical exegesis approach to  systematic theology, we seem to have a 'free-will free-for-all'.  This  volume is an invaluable resource to marshal against unbiblical,  neo-evangelical encroachments on the Scriptural understanding of the Person  of God. While His many attributes can be distinguished, they cannot be  detached from each other or His Personhood. Any 'fresh rethinking' of any  one attribute, such as Omniscience (Can God know the future free actions of  created agents as anything but open possibilities?)has involuntary  unforeseen ripple/domino effects on each of the other attributes such as  Omnipresence, etc.  For example, if God cannot know a free-will future as  definite in advance in toto, micro, subatomic level, exhaustively, without  exception, then by definition, God cannot be truly Omnipresent in  space/time reality. God is not only Omniwhere, but Omniwhen; Omnithere and  Omnithen; Omnihere and Omninow. By ruling out God's exhaustive definite  foreknowledge of all future free-will activity, His Omnipresence is in  direct proportion downgraded to Multipresence, Penultimacy,  Quasi-Eternal,Finite. Thus, we have a 'whole new god', not the Bible's  Whole God. Sage, seeker, skeptic, saint - all will be challenged to  re-evaluate just what God is believed in by careful consideration of this  excellent volume.

The case  is powerfully made for the WHOLE church to take the WHOLE gospel to the  WHOLE world.  Pastors were never raised up by God to be personal chaplains  for lay people, but more like head coaches, trainers, equippers and  division commanders to recruit, build up and deploy God's people into the  field where real ministry takes place: outreach, community involvement,  mercy ministries, cultural change agents, etc. The church rises and falls  on leadership - and followership. Both are equal partners in the task God  has called His church to do, and both need to be fully and cooperatively  (not competitively or mutually exclusively) involved.  A great tool for  pastors to review the Biblical perspective and for lay leaders/members to  be mobilized and encouraged.	2000-08-07

It  definitely achieves its stated goal of making history user-friendly and  helps the reader see how life in the 21st Century fits into the complex  flow of Civilization. One comes away knowing The God of History is in  complete control, each ordinary member of Christ's Body can make a  difference and, despite worldwide persecution, Western Civilization's moral  free-fall, and many challenges and battle defeats, God will ensure that the  War will be won.   More Scripture references would have been helpful to  provide a sharper Biblical perspective of how History is His Story.

Carson's  overarching theme is what he calls COMPATIBILITY. When dealing with texts  seemingly mutually exclusive,using Scripture's own suppositions yields  mutual compatible sense where texts complement each other, not compete or  contradict. Mystery in Scripture is not meant to be resolved, but wise  exegetes try to elucidate the unknowns that most faithfully and plausibly  address counterarguments. When dealing with the Infinite God, multiple  truths can co-exist simultaneously on different planes (God's and ours).  Good vs. Evil, among other Biblical mysteries, cannot be fully, finitely  comprehended, let alone synthesized and exhaustively communicated  theologically, logically, metaphysically, philosophically or otherwise.  These are merely components of the Biblical 'givens' Scripture's authors  teach or assume. The interpreter's challenge is to locate the mystery in  the right place, define terms, remain anchored to Scripture's own  parameters and givens, ask the right preliminary questions before positing  answers and avoid eliminating the tension in mystery between planes (God's  and ours) so as not to do violence to either plane. Beware the all too  intuitive and natural eisegetical approach that makes absolute,  epistemologically precise, phenomenologically rigid, logically/literally  wooden reading of marshalled texts the sine qua non of pre-conceived  theological systems. This leads to massive misreadings of Scripture which  are 'too clever by half'which artificially justify unvalidated a priori's  that weave a grid unwittingly filtering out complementary data. Let  balanced exegesis taking all compatible(surface tension, depth resolution)  texts fairly and plainly and in unison 'stand in their naked power and  function without endless reductionism'. Amen!	2000-08-05

One  of the most prominent is an echo from his other writings(see essay in Still  Sovereign - Reflections on Assurance) which masterfully states: methodology  is the mother of meaning. Scripture presupposes or explicitly teaches  COMPATIBILISM, where apparently contradictory texts are instead mutually  compatible. Examples include: God is Sovereign and Man is responsible  agent;God loves the world yet only some are saved; Assurance is secure and  Christian Perseverence is necessary to endure;Future is settled(on God's  Divine, Infinite plane) and the Future is not closed (on Human, Finite  plane), etc. When COMPATIBILISM is neglected in Biblical interpretation,  incomplete methodologies are then applied to texts yielding asymmetrical,  polar distortion of Scriptural truth, theology and application. Such is the  fatal flaw in Postmodernism and its stepchildren neotheism, neo-Arminianism  and Process Thought(almost not worthy to be labeled 'theology'). This book  is must reading to keep current in contemporary theological dialog.	2000-08-05

Premise is made that acceptable theology must provide the most plausible,  Biblically inclusive rationale and motif embracing all Scriptural data, not  selective proof-texts in support or artificial exegesis of contrary texts.  Some excellent points in this book include: 1)Too much so-called  exegesis/Bible interpretation omits or dismisses attempts to discern how  Scripture fits together in toto(whole is greater than sum of its parts).  The Bible speaks a unified message/theology which perfectly encompasses all  the doctrines and sub-doctrines it contains, even if we can't sort them out  completely; 2)God's OMNIpresence includes both temporal and spatial  reality, not merely locational. He is not only &quot;OMNI-there&quot;, but  &quot;OMNI-then&quot;; &quot;OMNI-here and OMNI-now&quot;; 3)Many on both  sides of the issue of Sovereignty vs. Agency fall for the fallacy of the  excluded middle, not allowing both to be true in favor of either  Sovereignty or Agency; 4) Inordinate and often unwitting Eisegesis  substitutes for objective Exegesis in too much interpretation and textual  citation in defense of each position. Theological disposition interferes  with the natural, plain, main sense of texts and conclusions (bias in, bias  out); 5)There is full authenticity and reality of mortal participation in  God's purposes, just not in parity - God reserves the right to retain  ultimacy; 6) Framework verses, which reflect interpretive position and  predisposition, are necessary to set parameters for proper debate and  decision. Num.23:19 is posited as didactically controlling over less  definitive verses for internal harmonization of apparent conflicts, e.g.  God's repenting over pronouncements/decisions; 7)Scripture is seen as an  Oceanus Profundus - deep, vast ocean. Every text reveals something true of  God, but some are on the shore, some in tide pools, some in surf zone, some  off continental shelf, some in the blue depths, some in the Marianas  Trench. No passage takes the reader to the very infinite depths of the Mind  of God, but some clearly take us deeper than others. It is felt opponents  in this debate and others (God is Three and One; Jesus is God and Man;  Christian is Saint and Sinner; Jesus died for All and will surely save  some;Scripture is Divine and Human; God does not repent and, at times God  repents) often fail to sound the depths of verses marshalled in  support/refutation of positions. This results in misguided attempts to  reconcile or clarify the more profound in light of less profound, the more  rich and definitive in light of those less so, or to perceive all Scripture  as primarily of the same, uniform depth; 8) Concludes that 'divine  repentance in the Bible is meant to describe not some sort of existential  reaction in God to open, free events/wills but rather His perfectly just,  moral reciprocity' in language mortals can grasp (&quot;change of  mind&quot; is, after all, a metaphor in the human realm as well). Whatever  your position, this will stimulate theological juices.	2000-08-04

See also Millard Erickson's  &quot;Postmodernism&quot;; &quot;Evangelical Interpretation&quot;;  &quot;Evangelical Left&quot; for a fuller evaluation of philosophical,  theological and metaphysical systems that feebly try to go toe to toe with  an evangelical hermeneutic of the Bible and crash and burn every time.

Most appreciated is keeping Scripture in the magisterial role with  reason/logic in the ministerial role as all good exegetes should. The  author does an excellent, though brief, job of sketching the history of the  doctrine's development, metaphysical considerations, and outlines the  relevance of God as Triune to the Christian today. More helpful would be  analogies that help get a handle on 3 in 1: Egg=Shell+White+Yolk; Water is  H2O, 3 atoms in 1 molecule, as well as water existing simultaneously(like a  Minnesota cloud) as vapor,condensation,hail (solid, liquid, gas); not  1+1+1=3, but  1x1x1=1; volume=LxWxH; U.S. Gov't is Legislative, Executive,  Judicial branches; human is body, mind, spirit;Divine Family is Father and  Son and Holy Spirit. There is a careful balance maintaining the integrity  of God as three persons yet one essence or Being. Of animal beings, there  are trillions of members; of human beings there are billions of members; of  Supreme Being there are three members.  For a more comprehensive treatment,  read author's larger volume, God in Three Persons.	2000-08-02

What is needed for any theological/doctrinal  system that challenges evangelical/historical positions is a  declaration,discussion and defense of such presuppositions, how they  compare to the competition and why theirs are more plausible/tenable. Until  postmodernism and other movements such as neotheism can engage at this  fundamental level, any meaningful dialog with reality and Biblical truth is  futile. Recommended highly to stimulate further research in this  challenging arena.	2000-08-02

Faithful to Biblical text, logical, consise, contemporary, fairly evaluating interpretive options and honestly and humbly coming down on the side of views most persuasive to his research.   Hallmarked by clarity and completeness without sacrificing brevity.   Balanced and objective doing justice to the Scriptural witness without  compromising truth or conviction.  What is most admirable is how he  masterfully refuses to artificially resolve doctrinal/theological  paradoxes, but lets them stand in the hope that they may resolve into a  higher, complementary, whole-orbed truth unknowable here and now.  He  follows the Biblical injunction, &quot;Do not go beyond what is  written.&quot;  As Scripture is not beholden to any doctrinal camp or  denominational persuasion, so the author heroically strives to follow suit,  producing a truly Biblical theology summation, the finest I have seen of  late.  See D.A. Carson's Exegetical Fallacies and note how few (if any) are  repeated in this excellent volume.	2000-07-30

Not only young practitioners should heed this sage preacher's advice, but all who seek to communicate God's truth  should re-read this volume at least once a year to review the fundamentals,  re-focus on the hows and whys of basic hermeneutics, and abide by the  Biblical dictum, &quot;Do not go beyond what is written.&quot;  Variety at  the expense of verity is vanity.

Every theological framework, including neotheism, has a historical/philosophical  context with all the accompanying premises, stated or unstated, conscious  or unconscious.  The author irenically but repeatedly points out the  failure of neotheists to put their control belief cards on the table for  all to see, then honestly evaluate them in the light of Scripture, reason  and history/philosophy/logic for consistency, coherence, and  authentication.  Until this movement and its proponents are able/willing to  do this in a reasonably thorough way, it cannot hope to intelligibly or  meaningfully engage the historic Biblical position on God's infinite  foreknowledge, for example.  Assuming that even Almighty God cannot know a  future we humans have not created makes the god of neotheism in Phillips'  words, &quot;your god is too small&quot;, and thereby colors all relevant  texts examined in support of their theory.  Can't the Bible declare a God  Who knows all the future exhausively while simultaneously allowing humans  to unfold it making Him aware but them responsible?  The presupposition  that God knowing the future doesn't force humans to make it so should be  just as valid as the opposite premise.  Which is more plausible and  Biblical is a matter of examining all the relevant Scriptural material,not  selective anthropomorphic/anthropopathic verses, to see which  presupposition can account for all the Biblical data.  This book read in  conjunction with D.A.Carson's Exegetical Fallacies is a powerful rebuttal  to neotheism. See also Norman Geisler's Creating God in Man's Image.	2000-07-30

With all the recent attempts to re-evaluate and redefine the Biblical concepts of Who God is, this is a refreshing affirmation that  what Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, and all serious monothesists  have held is that God is Almighty, All-knowing, All-present without  exception. Many neo-theists ask, How can God know the unknowable, i.e. all  future events, words, thoughts of free moral agents who themselves have not  yet acted, thought, spoken?  Isn't the future open to some degree,  unavailable even to  God Himself?  Psalm 147:5 answers that question:  'Great is our LORD, and mighty in power; His understanding is  infinite.&quot;  Unless the Hebrew and English word for INFINITE has  changed over the years, honest exegetes are confronted with a mind beyond  finite human logic or comprehension.  See Erickson's excellent volume, The  Evangelical Left for the implications of a departure from an INFINITE vs.  finite understanding of God's foreknowledge.  This can only inevitably lead  to: God the Father(Almost) Almighty and a rewording of the Apostle's Creed,  updated to embrace neotheism. For to limit God's knowledge/wisdom is to  place human boundaries on His ability/power. Thankfully the author holds to  the Biblical concept of the God of ultimate, not penultimate  foreknowledge(Is.46:10, Jn.21:17, Job 38-39)	2000-07-30

Unknowingly almost  every interpreter of Scripture is doing eisegesis under the guise of  exegesis.  It is too easy and natural to seek what one is prone to find,  rather than just find what one may not be prone to seek. The author makes  the excellent observation that God discloses on the basis of our need to  know, not out need to want to know.  The Bible's purpose is to sanctify the  honest inquirer, not satisfy the curious.  Should be required reading for  all serious Bible students.  Hopefully a follow-up volume, updated over the  past ten years with many more contemporary examples, can be produced.	2000-07-30

Sounds like OMNISCIENCE on face  value plain sense. One item unknown by God would yield penultimate  knowledge.Shouldn't call ltd. foreknowledge omni.Rev.1:19 has Jesus  revealing 'the things which will take place after this' including multiple  free-will decisions by human and angelic agents in explicit detail as  absolute certainties, not conditional divine, best-guess prognostications  eg. Nostradamus, Jeane Dixon, etc. Is.55:8-9'My thoughts are not your  thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, says the LORD. For as the heavens are  higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My  thoughts than your thoughts.&quot;Jesus also quotes sheep and goats on  Judgment Day (Mt.25:37,44) and Mt.7:22&quot;Lord, Lord...&quot;, 2,000+  yrs. before they will be actually uttered. Now that's exhaustive  OMNIscience!&quot; Rev.6:15-16 quotes &quot;Fall on us and hide us from the  face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb...who  shall stand?&quot;cf Lk.23:30,Hos10:8 How would the Lord know what the  judged will specifically say in thousands of years in a contingent,  free-agent future unless that was not an issue for an OMNIscient God? These  and multiple other Bible texts will need to be closely examined  individually and corporately for the author to raise his finite thoughts a  bit higher to catch a clearer glimpse of infinite, exhaustive,  OMNIforeknowledge - Is. 46:10,Jn1:48,  Lk.22:10-12,Mk.11:2-6,Gal.1:15-16,Acts18:9-10,27:23-26,34;21:10-14. It's  also helpful to wonder why and how Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin,  Knox, Wesley, Edwards and other founding fathers of the faith could have  missed the Scriptures that limited God's omniscience about ALL future  events, thoughts, words, etc., only to be discovered recently by 'fresh  thought and modern insight'. Would God Almighty really want to wait until  20th/21st Centuries before His people began to get such an important  attribute of their Creator finally right!  I am unaware of any other  monotheistic scholarship (Jewish, Islamic, Roman Catholic, etc.) that  seriously puts forth such an openness of God theory in any convincing,  God-blessed way.	2000-07-27
