I think Palmer's personality descriptions are insightful and thought provoking.<br /><br />It is also the best starting point for anyone interested in personality types who wish to delve deeper on this subject.<br /><br />What I find most amazing is that you will never see this topic, ever discussed in any collegiate psychology department.  For them, ideas are like religion and they can never agree.<br /><br />The truth is this one book would put most of them out of business.  Or rather, there are more truths in this book than most others.<br /><br />These books as a class, describe what I'd call the unified theory of personality types.  It gives you a clear picture of who you are, why you act the way you do, and what you are likely to do under pressure or stress.  All of this applies others around you too.<br /><br />This is a must read book for anyone interested in finding out who they are.  I recommed it as a present to give it to any recent graduate because this is not taught in schools.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.	2004-12-12

My sister-in-law Pricilla, passed this book on to me, and I'm grateful.  It's the best book I've read this year, and hard to put down.<br /><br />This story tells a scary society that is not free.  Something to think about.<br /><br />**********************************************<br /><br />Slavomir Rawicz was a Polish Cavalry Officer in 1941 when Germany and Russia steamrolled over Poland. Guilty of nothing, Rawicz details how he was brain washed, tortured, beaten, drugged by the Russians, and finally sentenced to 25 years of hard labor in Siberia.  I was stunned by the brutality of the Russians, and the Nazi-like world they created.  The fatality rate due to the hardships encountered, I found, horrifying.<br /><br />Rawicz is young, 25, and toughed by the thousand mile winter march from the Trans-Siberian Railroad to the labor camp, and by the people dying around him.  He survives, builds his strength, and later escapes with a group of men who dared to walk 3000 miles at 20 miles a day.  The whole journey from Poland to Siberia including the 1000 mile winter march, and the 3000 mile walk from Siberia to India are compelling example, of grit, spirit, determination, and will-power.<br /><br />I'm compelled to search for still more information on these dark days.  This book shows a narrow slice, albeit in great detail, of the atrocities committed by the USSR in its formative years. This is a period of history that needs much wider dissemination, and discussion.<br /><br />Rawicz is still alive; living in England.  God bless him.<br /><br />Conrad Senior	2004-10-07

This new edition is my second book on this topic by him, and I highly recommend it.  It is a hand's on book, and something you want next to you when you try Tcl/Tk.<br />Perhaps the title should be Prac-Tcl Programming in Tcl and Tk, because Tcl, is pronounced tickle, and is an acronym for Tool Control Language.  Tk, short for Toolkit, is a multi-platform graphical user interface.  The two go hand in hand, but you can use Tcl without Tk.<br />What is so great about Tcl/Tk?  For one thing it is FREE for private and commercial use, and available on-line!  I've used Tcl on Sun Solaris systems, and played around with it on Windows, and it works also on Macintosh.  Tcl is a fun and useful scripting language, powerful enough to do anything you might want to do, from short simple scripts to large stand alone GUI applications that run on multiple platforms.<br />A CDROM is included with the book with recent versions.  See below for a copy of the CD-ROM index.<br />I've used ksh and csh in the past and found the former's syntax to be a pain in the butt, and the later's to lack the power I needed.  Tcl gave me the power I wanted, and was fun and exciting to use.  This prompted me to dig deeper into Tcl and now I love it.  Although I'm not an expert, I know enough to appreciate Tcl and chose it as an important part of my personal software \\"toolbox\\".<br />What is Tk?  Tk is a fast method of developing and changing the user interface via a script interface.<br />Here is why:<br />1) Development is fast because there are no long compilations.<br /><br />2) It takes just a handful of command to define a user interface.  Re-iteration of the process allows you to refine the user interface to make it perfect.<br />3) The application can be written in Tcl.  Following this the user interface development is fast and painless.<br />Normally, I include a copy of the index in my review.  Unfortunately that would have taken a week to type up, because of it's detail.  Included below is a copy of the HTML from the CD-ROM index for your information.<br />I'm sure you will find the book worth evey penny, and be grateful, as I am, that the authors put together just and outstanding reference for us.  This is the only Tcl reference I'd recommend at this time.  Enjoy.<br />CONRAD B. SENIOR<br />23 July 2003<br />*********************************<br />CD-ROM Includes:<br />-- The tcl8_3 and tcl8_4 directories contain the source distributions for recent Tcl versions. The latest on this CD-ROM is Tcl/Tk 8.4.2. There are Manual Pages for Tcl and Tk commands and C APIs.<br />-- The ActiveTcl directory contains pre-compiled binary distributions created by ActiveState. This includes the TclDevKit professional toolkit, which includes a debugger, syntax checker, and more. ActiveTcl is free, and the distribution comes with many extensions already configured. TclDevKit requires a license, and you can visit the ActiveState web site to obtain a trail license.<br />ActiveTcl is a trademark of ActiveState Corporation<br />-- The tclkit8.4.2 directory contains pre-compiled binaries for the Tclkit application, which is an extended Tcl/Tk shell used to create Starkits. You can also use Tclkit just like Wish or Tclsh, and it comes as a self-contained, single file that is quite convenient. The tclkit8.4.1 directory contains Tclkit builds for additional platforms, including Macintosh, that were not yet available for 8.4.2 when this CD was assembled. There are also complete sources and instructions for building Tclkit yourself.<br />-- The handheld directory contains Tcl variants that have been created for small handheld devices. These are fairly experimental, but I can recommend the Toucan development environment for creating Tcl apps on PalmOS.<br />Starkits<br />The sdarchive directory contains quite a lot of Starkits, which are packaged Tcl/Tk extensions or applications that are designed to work with Tclkit. Starkits are a great packaging and deployment technology for Tcl/Tk applications.

On the other hand I liked Monty Kennedy's sense of humor.<br />My advice for those who are interested in learning how to checker is this:<br />First, choose hard, fine grain wood to practice on.<br />Second, ensure the wood is as smooth as possible and all grain is filled with varnish--this makes the checkering process less error prone.  Uneven material surface and grain is likely to cause your tools to deviate from the your chosen path.<br />Third, don't use too fine a checker or the diamonds will break off.<br />Fourth, purchasing a decent set of tools.<br />Fifth, scribe your reference lines and trace your outline pattern and go at it.<br />Sixth, your best bet is to skip the book and practice on smoothly prepared sample material.<br />Seventh, don't get discouraged if your intitial results are not perfect, keep practicing, making smaller items like pistol or knife grips before tackling bigger projects.  Be sure the grips are entirely shaped, smoothed, and finished, with holes drilled before you start checkering.<br />The book is good for some sample pictures, but these can easily be duplicated by a visit to your local gun shops to study finely checkered stocks.  In fact you will get a better idea of what you like by studying many gun stocks.<br />The book is good for it's dry humor, which is sure to give you a few chuckles.  I liked the book but did not feel it was worth the price.  Invest your money in a set of tools.<br />Conrad B. Senior	2002-10-19

This is his best book and one of my all time favorite books.  It is about the armor people place around their souls and the armor they wear in battle.<br />Felix is a man who has lost his will to live.  He knows he is going to die, but has a core \\"Engine\\" inside of him that refuses to give up.  The \\"Engine\\" is Felix's armor against the world and gives him the ability to function in battle better than anyone else.<br />Felix begins his military life as a rookie in an assault drop on an alien race and he is the sole survivor.  Because of a computer glitch which assumed all of his group were killed, he gets dropped again and again into horrific battle, instead of getting rotated out for R&R.<br />The \\"Engine\\" inside of Felix fights on.  He is the sole survivor many times.  As the faces around him keep changing, he becomes the experienced survivor, admired by most, more and more of a loner, and finally begins to lose the ability to call on his Engine to survive.<br />Halfway through the book, the plot changes completely to a science station on a far off planet and a new character Jack Crow, nearly as tough as Felix, who teams with a brilliant scientist in replaying the recorder in Felix's battle armor.  Immersed in the horror, they pray for Felix's death to end the horror they are playing back.<br />The book ends with the reader wanting more.  Since there is no part II, you will find yourself rereading this book and picking up more detail and enjoying the subtle development of the book.<br />Outstanding book.  Buy two in case someone borrows it and keeps it.  Better yet, buy three and give a copy or two to you best friends.<br />One of the best and most engaging books you will ever read.	2002-04-22

Establishing latitude is relatively easy; one simply measures the angle the sun makes to the horizon.  The problem of longitude eluded mankind for ages.  In 1714, the British government posted a prize for the first man to develop an accurate and reliable means of establishing longitude at sea.  This started one of the most important technological races in history.  On one side were the astronomers who believed that the answer lay in the heavens.  On the other one man who felt he could develop an accurate timepiece.<br /><br />The author relates some of the horrify miscalculations that resulted in ships being unable to establish their positions accurately.  In one example, Admiral Sir Clowdisly Shovell's fleet of five ships were returning from Gibraltar when four of his five ships struck the rocks of the Scilly Islands with a loss of over two thousand men.  This was one of literally hundreds of horrifying instances, where ships were lost because they lacked information on their longitude.  Then need for a mean of establishing longitude was critical.<br /><br />Galileo found a method for determining longitude, using the Jovian moons that worked well on land, but not on the unsteady platform of a ship at sea.  He did however, pave the way for astronomers that followed.  These eventually found a way to find position based on the motions of the moon.  This method was extremely complicated and time-consuming.  The research for a means to find longitude using the Moon took longer than expected and ultimately proved to be impractical for use at sea.<br /><br />In the meantime, a genius of a man, John Harrison, refined the timepiece, a method out of favor politically, because Sir Isaac Newton and Edmund Halley dismissed this as a practical means.  Unfortunately, the astronomers that followed continued to support this view.<br /><br />Harrison single-handedly found a means of establishing Longitude by developing an accurate timepiece that could maintain it's accuracy and withstand the variations of temperature, humidity, and shock.  This book is primarily about Harrison and his efforts to develop an accurate timepiece, which ultimately proved successful.  Later other timepieces followed created by other men who perfected mass-production of these timepieces.<br /><br />The story of Harrison is a magnificent triumph of a single man who stubbornly held fast to his beliefs and succeeded in accomplishing his goal in a lifetime.<br /><br />If you are a navigator, and interested in celestial navigation this is a must read book.

Establishing latitude is relatively easy; one simply measures the angle the sun makes to the horizon.  The problem of longitude eluded mankind for ages.  In 1714, the British government posted a prize for the first man to develop an accurate and reliable means of establishing longitude at sea.  This started one of the most important technological races in history.  On one side were the astronomers who believed that the answer lay in the heavens.  On the other one man who felt he could develop an accurate timepiece.<br /><br />The author relates some of the horrify miscalculations that resulted in ships being unable to establish their positions accurately.  In one example, Admiral Sir Clowdisly Shovell's fleet of five ships were returning from Gibraltar when four of his five ships struck the rocks of the Scilly Islands with a loss of over two thousand men.  This was one of literally hundreds of horrifying instances, where ships were lost because they lacked information on their longitude.  Then need for a mean of establishing longitude was critical.<br /><br />Galileo found a method for determining longitude, using the Jovian moons that worked well on land, but not on the unsteady platform of a ship at sea.  He did however, pave the way for astronomers that followed.  These eventually found a way to find position based on the motions of the moon.  This method was extremely complicated and time-consuming.  The research for a means to find longitude using the Moon took longer than expected and ultimately proved to be impractical for use at sea.<br /><br />In the meantime, a genius of a man, John Harrison, refined the timepiece, a method out of favor politically, because Sir Isaac Newton and Edmund Halley dismissed this as a practical means.  Unfortunately, the astronomers that followed continued to support this view.<br /><br />Harrison single-handedly found a means of establishing Longitude by developing an accurate timepiece that could maintain it's accuracy and withstand the variations of temperature, humidity, and shock.  This book is primarily about Harrison and his efforts to develop an accurate timepiece, which ultimately proved successful.  Later other timepieces followed created by other men who perfected mass-production of these timepieces.<br /><br />The story of Harrison is a magnificent triumph of a single man who stubbornly held fast to his beliefs and succeeded in accomplishing his goal in a lifetime.<br /><br />If you are a navigator, and interested in celestial navigation this is a must read book.

In some cases the article are only interesting from the perspective that they were written long ago from a different point of view than today.  Others are simply excellent stories that convincingly describe past yachting history.<br />This is one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read.  The story of the original America's Cup race is facinating and different from other versions I've heard.  I believe it is an accurate description of the race and it debunks part of the myth of the America's Cup and puts it in perspective.  A later essay, on Capt. Charlie Barr, describes how the America's Cup became more famous.  Captain Barr was an outstanding seaman and leader and it was his skill and seamanship that won several of the America's Cup races.<br />This is a classic book and worthy of a place on your bookshelf.

The action is fast and furious.<br /><br />This is second in a series of historical fiction by Dudley Pope. All of these are fictional novels based on British Admiralty records of the Napoleonic era. Written in the best tradition of Forester and O'Brien, these books will capture your imagination.  And if you haven't read the Hornblower series by Forester, or the Aubrey/Maturin series by O'Brien, try them also. All of these are excellent books that you will treasure and reread. I particularly like these books by Pope. I recommend that you buy them all at once and read them in order. You will be glad you did.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading accurate descriptions of naval maneuvers in the age of sail, or simply a good adventure yarn, Dudley Pope delivers. Pope conveys how the best of the best, handle emergency situations. He portrays these situations with realism and authenticity.<br /><br />Review of this book:<br /><br />Ramage, in command of cutter Kathleen, is ordered to proceed to Gibralter to support Lord Nelson.  On the way, he manages to find a unique way to capture a dismasted Spanish frigate and untold other adventures, that I won't give away.<br /><br />This book describes Ramage's exicting activities immediately prior to and through the battle of Trafalgar where he plays a pivotal role.  The actual battle of Trafalgar, aside from a few liberites take with respect to our hero, is not surprisingly accurate in the account of battle.  The book is great fun and so is the next one!<br /><br />*************************************************	2001-04-04

Give people a questionaire to help them determine what personality type they are.<br /><br />WRONG!  It may help you do this, but the same goal can be accomplished by reading any of the other books. If you read about a personality type and it fits, you will know what type you are.<br /><br />So what is the point in buying this book?  I don't see any point.  Buy a better book and if you want to enlighten someone else, give them detail, not a bunch of questions.<br /><br />I found this book turned people off to the Enneagram.  That is the last thing you want to do.<br /><br />The Enneagram is enlightening.  Don't become jaded about it from reading this book.<br /><br />Don't buy this book unless you have read any of the other books by Riso or Palmer on the Enneagram.<br /><br />One final point.  I think Riso's other books are fabulous.<br /><br />*********************************************************	2001-02-16

Feelers, Thinkers, and Relators.  Each of these has three sub-types, and each of these sub-types has a healthy, average and unhealthy sub-sub-type.<br /><br />Additionally, your personality type varies depending on whether you are under stress, relaxed, or average (sometimes called childhood state).  The Enneagram is an ancient symbol that diagrams the relationship of the different personality types move to other types depending on your state of mind.<br /><br />It is not the whole answer to how people think, but a large part of it.  You will be amazed.<br /><br />Consider this.  If you read this book and determine what personality type a friend or relation is, you can then predict, with a high degree of accuracy, how they will react.  With time, you can get quite good at it.<br /><br />Some examples of the nine principal types:  Helpers-the type of people that give you many small gifts, but then look for the big payoff, Performers-who sacrifice feeling for gold stars and high grades, Observers-who fear the unknown, and have a sense of awareness of their environment and understanding or people that is almost supernatural, Leaders-who see only black and white, and never shades of gray, and the Flakes, who break plans if something else more interesting comes along.  There are nine of them.  Study them all.<br /><br />Find out what personality type you are.  Unless you are a type 7 you will find this very informative.  If you are a type 7 it probably won't do you any good.<br /><br />Any book an the Enneagram is a book that will open your eyes, your vision will be expanded.  Read it.<br /><br />*********************************************************	2001-02-16

I consider them to be two of the most important<br />books for sailors that are boat owners.<br /><br />One can take two routes with<br />boats, buying new and paying a fortune, or going the inexpensive route<br />and doing the work yourself.  There is something to be said for each.<br />I'm a sailor, I don't like working on boats.  I had my fill as a child<br />working on my Dad's boat.  Nevertheless, I'm presently engaged in<br />refitting an awesome older boat to modern standards.  I love every bit<br />of it.<br /><br />Casey's books are essential references for me.  I've managed<br />to pick things up from magazines and working on other boats over the<br />years, but I still found these books not only insightful and powerful<br />motivators for me.  One job that I have been reluctant to do, a deck<br />modification project has suddenly become do-able for me.  Reading his<br />book made it clear to me that these jobs are not as hard as they first<br />seem to be.  It is difficult to cut up a nice looking deck, but if you<br />plan the project right, you can transform your deck layout for<br />single-handed sailing, fix a de-lamination problem and a multitude of<br />deck leaks all at one time.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book and his<br />Sailboat Hull and Deck Repair.<br /><br />Buy these books.  Map out a strategy<br />and then focus on one project at a time. Good luck and smooth<br />sailing.	2000-11-10

The book also includes two CD ROM's with RedHat Linux, rpm's (to get you started fast), and documentation.<br />This book is primarily suitable for novice Linux users, who will find they can get up to speed very fast with this text.  If you are visually oriented, this book is what you want.  The screen snap shots allow you to pick things up amazingly fast.  His examples will lead you step by step through just about everything you might want or need to know.<br />I liked the sections on Apache (a free web server)  and GNOME in particular.  Both of these applications are free like Red Hat Linux.  Apache is considered to be the worlds premier web server--it is yours now.  If you are considering a job in the computer industry--Linux (Unix) and Apache will take you a long way.<br />So although the book is big, I found it a fast read.  The author leads you visually, with screen shots, through lots of common tasks that you need to know.  I can't imagine a faster way to pick up this material.  the graphics make it all much more interesting.  I found I read and retained more this way.  It was a lot more fun.  Good job Micheal!<br />Michael Bellomo is one of my favorite computer book authors.  If you read just one of his books you won't hesitate to buy another book by him.  Bellomo keeps things simple.  I think he must either have taken great notes as he went about learning this material, or else he has a natural flare for understanding what people want to know.<br />This book, Master RED HAT Visually, typifies that.  I remember the first time I dug into Linux.  Things that are relatively simple in MS Windows are more challenging in Linux.  Like how do you stop a program that will not respond to a kill command?  That can and will drive you nuts.<br />I had lots of trouble, especially with the graphical user interface (GUI).  I had a program lock up on me and I had to reboot to get it working again (OK, so I didn't know what else to do at the time!)  The point is you won't make mistakes like this if you read this book!<br />This book is a cheap investment in your sanity.  Bellomo will help you avoid such pitfalls and speed you on your way to the path of Linux enlightenment.<br />Finally, there are many GUI's for Linux.  I recommend you pick of the big ones like this one, GNOME, and stick with it until you know everything about it.<br />*********************************************<br />Conrad Seniorad lots of trouble, especially with the graphical user interface (GUI).

You will use the index in the back of this book, otherwise you  may find it difficult to return to your place if this hardbound edition  springs closed.  The book would seem to be comprehensive.  Still, I felt it  was a miss.<br /><br />When I ordered this book, I thought this would be a  valuable addition to my bookshelf.  I now feel I wasted my money.  This  is primarily because the presentation is poor, and secondarily because many  topics are stuffed in, often without adequate detail.  The author tries to  do too much and obviously cut out substance which should have been included  in the process.  I felt a lack of cohesiveness due to the avalanche of  information.<br /><br />With so many high quality books on sailing available, why  settle for a mediocre review of the subject.  Many important things were  included, but I felt that all of these could be found elsewhere in other  better texts.  Books should be easy to read.<br /><br />I think this book is good  enough that in the hands of a novice, he or she might feel is it everything  they need to know.  It is not.  There are many more subtleties to the  information presented.  For example, the author only gives brief mention to  the topic of broaching, its causes and prevention.  One paragraph does not  suffice for this topic.<br /><br />In some cases I felt that less is more.  For a  beginner, too much information is a bad idea.  Beginners need to know just  enough to get started and then more as time goes on.  So I felt that it  would be a bad reference for a beginner--there was just too much  information and I felt it would sink a novice sailor.  Or worse, make him  feel he knew everything he needed to know, by reading this book.  Each of  these topics could be explored in more depth, and should be, before moving  too quickly on to the next subject.<br /><br />For more experienced sailors much of  this information is readily available in better quality texts such as the  Annapolis Book of Seamanship--which has better illustrations, or Chapman's  which covers much more material, in greater depth and detail, with about  the same level of sleep inducement.  These two books cover most of what  you need to know.  From that point I would recommend studying more focused  books on the specific topic you are interested in expanding your  knowledge-racing, cruising, yacht repair, etc.<br /><br />I did like some of the  drawings, and the particular the depth in which docking was described.  This is a big problem area for most of my students.  I felt the diagrams  were too small and the eye was led to other diagrams before each could be  properly examined.  I found it difficult to focus on any one diagram.  Frankly, I couldn't study them all because the page was too busy to read  properly.<br /><br />This book does touch on the subject of mast bend-a topic often  ignored in other text-again I felt this topic deserved more attention-but  it was covered, unlike many other books.<br /><br />I think a classroom or on the  water is a better place to learn much of what is discussed in the  book.<br /><br />DANGER:  Readers should ignore the author's description of a man  over-board recovery suggestion and instead study the ASA or USS quick stop  methodology for a more practical, tested, and proven Man Over Board method.  I urge all sailors to practice this method until it is second nature.  The  author does a credible job of discussing actually getting the man back on  board but does not specifically mention the Life-Sling and its associated  block and tackle products, which were designed for this purpose.  I  recommend these products also.<br /><br />Buy this book if you are a dedicated  intermediate or advanced intermediate sailor searching to fill holes in  your knowledge.  You should be at least an intermediate sailor with an  inquiring mind.  Use it as a staring point to broaden your knowledge base,  and later focus more study effort into areas the interest you.  Use it like  an encyclopedia to begin research on a topic before moving on to more  focused books.<br /><br />Do not buy this book if you are a beginner.<br /><br />I do  recommend this book be used as a gift for a friend who sails, unless you  are trying to get rid of it like a white elephant.

Buy two copies.<br /><br />If you simply want to expand your  knowledge of seamanship-this book will give you some good ideas and is  worth the price.  I was particularly impressed with the emphasis on  commands, the descriptions of the chain of command-all principals that  should be applied to any vessel with a crew.<br /><br />Back Cover:<br /><br />Written for  cadets serving on the U.S. Coast Guard's famous training barque, Eagle, and  use by Tall Ship sailors around the world, this handy, pocket-sized manual  tells seamen all they need to know to sail a square rigger.  This new  edition, the first to appear in ten years, is easier than ever to follow,  and its simple step-by-step explanations of commands and procedures help  the reader through every important sailing maneuver.

So I was a little  disappointed at first.  I was only slightly interested in the interior  arrangements of the cabins.  BUT...<br /><br />After digging into it, I found lots of  cool stuff that could apply to handling any sailing vessel.  Like a good  way to scandalize (depower) a staysail when you don't have a furler.<br /><br />The  single piece of information I was most interested in was the layout of the  running rigging at the pin rails.  For a sailor to know the ropes-this  information must be committed to memory.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, and reread  in periodically to help keep the terminology fresh.<br /><br />Now, I'm trying to  figure out how to wrangle a passage on the Eagle-or at least a tour.d  in periodically to help keep the terminology fresh.

Books	5	9	9	N	N	*************  Amazing Stuff  READ THIS ******************	.<br /><br />I have not completed the book yet.  However I started on a high protein diet after seeing my buddy use it lose 50 lbs in 5 months.<br /><br />I was  suffering from all sorts of swings in my blood sugar that caused me to  sleep more, eat more, and feel fatigued all the  time--and crash every  afternoon 2 hours after lunch.<br /><br />GET THIS:  Just 3-4 days after starting  the diet I found myself full of energy, no 3pm crash, and I only need about  5-6 hours of sleep per night--amazing since I've always needed 9 hours of  sleep and STILL felt tired.  And, I find I'm not hungry and, since I have  energy, I don't crave sweets.  Read the book to find out more about how you  won't feel hungry and can watch others pig out on donuts while you don't  feel the slightest urge to have one.<br /><br />It is still early to tell.  I will  see what happens to my cholesterol levels in another month or so and report  back.<br /><br />I found my overall cholesterol levels went up and my ratio improved substantially.  The key to all this is to get plenty of exercise also.<br /><br />I am now on a diet of eggs white cooked over vegetables for breakfast--and this keeps me gong a long time and provides the carbs I need to keep my brain sharp.  It works to cut your appetite for carbs.  You won't crave sugar or starches.<br /><br />Overall, I rate the book worth a read, but you can get the same information online.	2000-08-16

Many of my students ask me how to get  invited out on boats more.  I tell them two things.  Sign on as crew on a  small boat in a one design fleet and, be prepared to not miss a race to  establish a reputation for reliability.  These things will do more to  improve your reputation and skills than anything else.<br /><br />This is the book I  now recommend to my students who want to learn about racing tactics without  being put to sleep.  I think it is the easiest to understand book on the  market for this subject.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the section on wakes on  pages 103-104.<br /><br />The book is strong on tactics, and weak on the finer  nuances of shifting gears for maximizing speed.  I recommend Buddy Melges  or Stuart Walker for more information on those topics--along with a GPS and  on-the-water experimentation.

Davis here charts an anecdotal, highly  personal course through our rich nautical history.  Written in a style both  entertaining and informal through which bubbles as genuine love of sailing  vessels and sea lore, American Sailing Ships evokes the very feel of salt  spray and rolling decks.<br />In nearly 140 photographs, prints and plans  (most drawn by the author, an accomplished marine architect), you'll find a  first-rate cross-section of a wide range of sailing ships from the  eighteenth through early twentieth centuries.  Here too is knowledgeable  discussion of ship size, design, proportion, rigging details and more.  Included are:<br />Block Islanders<br />Quoddy boats<br />Chebacco  Boats<br />Pinkys<br />Fishing Schooners<br />Clippers<br />Packet  Ships<br />Bugeyes<br />Oyster Luggers<br />Frigates<br />... and others<br />American  Sailing Ships offers lively discourse on shipbuilders such as 18th century  American designer Joshua Humphreys, whose frigates had no equal among the  sailing men-of-war of any other nation; illuminating insights regarding  crews, chains of command and life at sea; an account of how the  Gloucester-built chebacco boat Fame earned the right to that name as a  privateer during the War of 1812, outsailing and capturing vessels ten  times its weight; and much more.<br />Davis's classic work is sure to intrigue  sailing enthusiasts, historians, Americana buffs and model builders.  American Sailing Ships, here in its first popularly priced paperback  edition, promises the imaginative reader an unforgettable taste of  seafaring excitement.<br />---------------------------------------<br />Reviewers  comments:<br />Charles Davis wrote this book in 1929.  He especially loved  building models.  So much so, that he went to sea and sailed around Cape  Horn for the fun of it, and to learn more about these vessels.  Davis was a  man who knew the sea, knew boats, and loved them both.  His knowledge was  precious and I'm grateful he passed it on to us.<br />I would liken this book  to a modern book about fighter aircraft written today.  At the time he  wrote the book, the use of sailing craft for merchant purposes was passing  away.  The time was ripe for a book of this nature.<br />This book is 196 fact  filled pages.  Have you ever wondered how many men were on a gun crew of a  frigate?  What their positions and responsibilities were in battle?  This  book will tell you.<br />I was pleased with the drawings, which were  excellent.  They had nice detail.  I was suprised that I could not find  fault with any of them!  The photographs of ships in the water, on the  hard, and models were excellent and added perspective to the included line  drawings.  The book includes over 140 drawings and photographs.<br />Davis  included useful descriptions of the deck layout, and many rigging details,  weight of anchors, and information on the spars.<br />What I liked best were  his stories about the various ships like the then famous &quot;Black  Ball&quot; Line of packet ships, which were the first ever to sail  regularly on the 1st and 16 of every month between New York and Liverpool.  His descriptions of life aboard fascinating reading, written by a man knew  what he was talking about relating his personal experiences.  He brought  the times back to life!<br />He also included some fun stuff like sea  chanteys.  &quot;The words of each line of the song are made up by the  chanteyman with no sense whatever, so long as the last word of each couplet  harmonizes.\\" says Davis.  The Yo-o-o-o-o being drawled out with the  &quot;Ho&quot; sharp and crisp.<br />Solo:  Oh the cook he's mixing up his  bread!<br />Chorus:  Yo-o-o-o-o-ho, heave the man down!<br />Solo:  An when you  it eat it yo'll drop dead!<br />Chorus:  Yo-o-o-o-o-ho, heave the man  down!<br />Solo:  Oh the old man's a going for to shoot the sun.<br />Chorus:  Yo-o-o-o-o-ho, heave the man down!<br />Solo:  Ay' this here old topsail it  must weigh a ton.<br />Chorus:  Yo-o-o-o-o-ho, heave the man down!<br />I think  anyone would enjoy this book.  It has details for the model builder, lots  of great pictures, and fun stories for everyone.<br />If you have ever sailed  or wanted to sail on a ship rigged vessel.

Denny Moore and his wife  decided to break away and do something exciting--buy a boat and cruise.  They never planned to sail around the world--what started as a Caribbean  cruise turned into a round the world voyage--downwide most of the  way.<br />Denny and his wife Velda made every possible mistake on this trip,  but triumphed in achieving what few people have the guts to do. We can  learn by the mistakes the made and also by their bravery and courage.<br />I  really enjoyed this book and have read it twice and even traded some email  with Denny.  I'm pleased to have known him in this way.  Thanks Denny for a  great book.<br />This book would be a great gift idea for a nautical man.  It has some meat to it.  456 pages.  Nice illustrations and photos.<br />Here  is an excerpt to get your interest.<br />  &quot;Perhaps foolishly but  understandably, considering how long we had been at sea and how badly we  needed to see land and to replenish our stores, I was carrying the full  twelve hundred feet of sail in our fore-and-aft rig, trying to keep moving  against a northwest breeze and a stiff little chop that was developing.<br />  The boat hit a wave, bigger than others, which stopped her cold.  At the  same moment, we fell into a deep trough, and rolled violently to port.  It  was like a slow-motion demolition derby.<br />  I was listening to things  tumbling about in the galley, when suddenly I hear a splintering  SNAAAP-CRACKKK overhead and looked up in time to see the topmast fall  forward, pulled down by the jib topsail, now partly in the water.<br />  Velda  came running up the ladder and took the wheel in hurried response to my  started cry, trying to hold the bow into the weather, while Sylvia and I  went forward to drag the sail out of the water.  Almost immediately, we  stopped and were rolling in the trough.<br />  Some 12 feet of the topmast was  dangling upside down, suspended from its splintered stub by electrical  wires and bits of rigging.  The boat rolled heavily, and with each roll,  the broken mast swung out and back like a huge wooden flail, hammering the  complex rigging at the crosstrees 35 feet above our heads.  Bits of wood,  broken blocks and other debris fell with each blow.  I knew I had to go  aloft...&quot;<br />Good reading.ed stub by electrical  wires and bits of rigging.

Review and Index of the Book.	.<br />This is a comprehensive, useful book detailing all aspect of the new  Korn Shell.  The Korn shell is not just a UNIX shell, but also a  programming language that is powerful and well suited for a UNIX power  user.  If you are not computer or UNIX savy, you would be better off using  the csh (C-SHELL).<br />Since, the Korn shell is powerful and hence, more  complicated than typical UNIX shell programs.  The need for a good book on  the subject is mandatory for those who wish to master it.<br />It also  contains a good tutorial and, my favorite, a quick reference guide on the  back cover.  The quick reference is a very useful item worth photocopying  and pinning to the wall by your workstation.  Each entry is keyed to the  page with more detailed information on the command.  It is fast and  handy.<br />Anyone who reads this book will develop a better understanding of  shells in general.  The author explains many of the common shell tools such  as piping and redirection.<br />This book is an excellent text for the  subject.  I strong recommend it for those who are presently Korn shell  users or those who wish to master this shell.

All the books are skimpy fast reads.  I hope my opinion is  changed, but I'm unwilling to invest in any more of them to find out.<br />He  has a some of good advice for sailors at sea.  However, I have to say, that  like most of his books I take what he writes with a grain of salt.  And,  some of what he recommends, I doubt he ever did himself.<br />That is not to  say his advice is bad, just not practical in some cases.  I doubt many  seaman would follow all of his advice.<br />For example, he recommends that  single handed sailor drag a line behind the boat hooked up to a trip wire  arrangement to heave the boat to.  Great advice.  I doubt anyone follows it  or that Tristan Jones did so.  That doesn't mean it is not good advice.  This sort of thinking is smart thinking, planning ahead for an  emergency.<br />Likewise his advice for having a triangular patch of canvas  ready and rigged on the bow with control lines all set ready to cover a  hole below the waterline should the unlike event happen that one gets holed  below the waterline.  This is just something that would get in the way,  foul up something else on the boat and cause more trouble than it's worth.  I think a better idea is have one ready to go and practice rigging  it.<br />Perhaps these ideas may make sense when you are sitting at a  typewriter trying to put enough substance in a book so you can sell it to a  publisher.  This is my impression of Tristan Jones.<br />If you get  something out of a book like this, you got something that may give you an  idea that will save your boat or yourself.<br />I gave it 3 stars because I  felt it was like some of his other books, short books made in an attempt to  make money to fund his roving lifestyle as a wandering seaman.<br />Hey he  pulled it off.<br />Maybe you can too!

This in turn will make you feel more comfortable when you hire a surveyor to meet an  insurance requirement or to evaluate things you don't feel competent to do  yourself.<br />This book does a great job explaining how glass is laid up, the  different types of glass, mat, roving, etc, and where they should be used.  Common problems found in fiberglass boats such as blistering are discussed  with lots of surprising information.<br />I've found that my personal  experiences confirmed many of the points made by the author.  Like the myth  that fresh water boats are better than salt water.  Contrasted with fresh  water boats are more likely to have blister problems than saltwater.<br />Today, many people come to me with questions about boats.  As I write  this review, I realize that many of the answers I give out come out of  information I found in this book.<br />I don't believe you have to have a  survey on a boat to make an intelligent purchase decision.  In part,  because some of the surveyors are only interested in your money, and do not  look boats over thoroughly.  A properly educated individual can do most or  all of his, or her, own survey.<br />Some surveyors are very good, and some  are very bad.  How can you tell if someone is good or not?<br />To become a  surveyor some certifying organizations only require a couple of sample  copies of surveys done and that you have a few books on your bookshelf.  What a joke!<br />I personally know of a real case, which happened in 1999,  where an old survey was pulled up, the date changed and it was reused  without any a new survey being actually done.  This is a good reason to  choose your own surveyor and not the one recommended by the seller.<br />Going aloft and checking the rigging on a boat is not easy.  Is it not  surprising that important steps like these get skipped.<br />Some surveyor's  haven't read this book--so how good can they be?  Contrast this with  someone who has taken a 8 week course on surveying, holds a USCG license,  and grew up on boats.  This is the kind of person you want for a  surveyor.<br />It is up to you to be knowledgeable enough to make your own  decisions-including choosing a surveyor if you feel you need one.  This  book will help you do that.<br />Educate yourself.  Being able to look a boat  over to evaluate it for purchase is an important skill.  This book is a  good starting point.  It is cheap insurance and worth the price.ntrast this with  someone who has taken a 8 week course on surveying, holds a USCG license,  and grew up on boats.

The creation of a slick  of disturbed water, by use of a parachute type anchor, held just below the  surface, two wavelengths directly upwind of you, can do the same thing and  create a pocket of relatively undisturbed water, in which a boat can ride  out a violent storm safely.<br /><br />This being the case, the crew have only two  concerns.<br /><br />1)  Keeping the boat positioned so that the sea takes one  side of the bow more than another prevents oscillations and keeps the ride  smooth.  Keep the bow strait to the seas is actually rougher and not  desirable.  This offset can be made with a bridle.  And,<br /><br />2)  Preventing  chafe, which will part your rode and lose your para-anchor, and put you at  the mercy of the full fury of a storm.<br /><br />The Pardey's successfully used  these techniques to heave-to in storms and avoid loosing ground when the  winds became unfavorable, and then continued on when conditions moderated.  They did this with confidence.<br /><br />My only concern, is the Pardey's  experience was strictly small boat.  Small boats have an advantage in a  way, in that they can be easier to handle.<br /><br />The question remains.  How  well will these techniques work with larger boats.<br /><br />I would like to read  about the results of people using this technique in a larger boat in more  severe conditions.  For example: a 42-48 foot catamaran and/or a 45-50'  monohull in 100+ mph winds with large breaking seas.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW:  6-27-2008<br /><br />******************************************<br />Not only is this mandatory reading for those who sail offshore; it is as important to have this book on your vessel, as it is to have Chart 1.<br /><br />I don't know any one with a sailing library as big as mine.  I have so many books on the topic that I really need to get rid of some.  Of all these many books, I'd rate Lin and Larry Pardey's book on \\"Storm Tactics\\" as \\"the most important book in my collection.\\"  The reason for that is this book will save your life.  The information it contains is distilled down from the experiences of these two fine people, and presented to you in a convincing manner.  No one who reads this book will every doubt that their tactics are the correct choice to see you safely through the worst of \\"it\\".  Not only that, but if anyone else on your boat begins to panic, hand them this book.  Once they know that you really know what to do, and how one can create a zone of protection from breaking waves, they will loose their fear and panic.<br /><br />Years ago I read the first edition of this book and at that time, I felt the knowledge passed on to me, by these two legendary sailors, was about the most important information I could know.  Unfortunately, many sailors have gotten away from the traditional methods of heaving-to, or laying-to, and laying-to a parachute type sea-anchor.  Loose your racing mentality, that will get you killed, and adopt Lin and Larry tactics and you will survive.<br /><br />Through real life experimentation, and retelling of many real events, any reader will be convinced, as I was, of the importance of this tactic.  I've hove-to on the ocean, and was frankly stunned at how really well it works.  I tell everyone about it. You will too.  Try it, learn from it, and be absolutely sure you do not ignore their advice.  I've owned a Para-Anchor for years, but I have yet to test it out.  I will change that, because it is abundantly clear that practicing with this equipment is nearly as important as having it.<br /><br />Below is a list of the contents of the book.  I read it cover to cover, and by that I mean, I spent many hours reading each page carefully.  I could only find a few minor suggestions to add to it.  For example, if you are leaving your roller furled sail furled on your forestay or headstay, the Pardey's recommend removing this sail.  But if it is left up, they recommend wrapping your spinnaker halyard around the furled sail to ensure it stays secure.  I'd like to suggest that if you leave it up, take care to wrap the spinnaker halyard around this sail in the counter direction to the furl--I'm sure they meant to say this, but is it not specifically mentioned in the book. I also feel that a storm trysail should have it's only halyard, and that halyard should have an exit block at the place on the mast where the sail is fully hoisted. (i.e. it's own dedicated halyard).  This is to avoid halyard slap which drives me out of my mind.  Like the Pardey's I like a quiet boat--particularly at anchor, so when I hear halyard slapping, I know it is another boat swinging near me and it is time to get up and check to see if someone is swinging too close to me.<br /><br />I also wish they had discussed the mechanisms of Cape Horn's Williwaw's in more detail.  These are dense masses of cold air on top of plateaus at the higher latitudes, and are to trip and fall down the slopes, accelerating to creating sudden, intense, violent winds out onto the water at speeds of, I've read as much as 120 knots.  A sudden drop in temperature is your only warning, and chances are this will not give you enough time to react, before your boat is on the rocks.<br /><br />I no longer have concerns about how this technique will work on larger boats.  My feeling is the Pardey's discussion of sizing a Para-anchor to allow the boat to slip is a critical part of the tactic.  From what I've read it seems that a Para-Anchor about 1/3 the length of the boat is the right size.  They recommend not going overboard on size and I agree with there assessment--read the book and you will agree also.<br /><br />Here is the table of contents.  I added a few comments after some chapter heading, in parentheses.<br /><br />Storm Management<br />1.  Storms and Cruising<br />2. Some Cautionary Tales and Thoughts on Heavy Weather<br />3.

A friend recommended that I pick this up book, and also the next few  volumes. She said I'd get hooked on it and I was.  I bought 5 of the 17  volumes (now up to 19) and then went out a week later and bought the rest.  I spent the next few months fighting with my sister for each copy as we  each raced through the whole series.<br />Lucky Jack Aubrey is a bold naval  officer who befriends Steven Maturin, a physician and multilingual spy, in  their efforts to thwart Napoleon's ambitions for the British Empire.  The  two oddball friends provide an interesting contrast as Patrick O'Brien  takes us back 200 years and give us British Naval History more or less  intact with the exception that he places these two hero's on the scene.  Some explanation is given at the start of each story as to what is real and  what is fiction.<br />O'Brien's writing style uses turn of the century  terminology and language--which can be confusing at times, especially some  of the nautical maneuvers, but lends more authenticity to each volume.<br />My  only regret is that I purchased the paperbound version.  These books are  worth keeping and re-reading.  I recommend you purchase them in the hard  bound edition which will hold up as you re-read them in the future.	2000-08-03

I strongly  recommend the complete series, and the sailing program for any new sailor  who wishes to learn to sail using time proven methods developed by  experts.<br />The concept of US Sailing is to give you what you need to know  at each stage of learning associated with your practical on-the-water  experience.<br />Once you have mastered the basics of handling a keelboat,  in the Basic Keelboat course, you progress with this book, Basic Cruising,  into more advanced topics to refine the skills you have and learn new ones  such as anchoring and an introductory to piloting.<br />By the time you  complete this course and apply what you have learned on the water, you  should be ready to take a small boat out on your own and successfully  command a moderately experienced crew.  The associated certification will  allow you to present credentials that will allow you to charter small boats  worldwide.  Good luck and smooth sailing.	2000-07-31

He was rudely brushed off and told to figure it out for himself.  That event started his multi-year quest to document the facts of  rigging and handling &quot;ship rigged&quot; vessels.  He scientifically  studied the subject and the result is this book.<br />This is a book that  was studied by many of those that went to sea in the days of the tall ship.  Any books that follow mearly tread in the footsteps of this giant.<br />If  you have an interested in Square Rigged vessels, whether to sail them today  or to build models, you will need this book.<br />The only negative thing I  can say it that it is not up to modern standards on illustration, writing  style, and terminology.  I found some parts difficult to understand because  I was unfamiliar with some of the arcane terminology.  This, to me, makes  the book even more interesting.<br />Thanks to one rude sailor, who motivated  Darcy Lever, we have today this outstanding book written on this subject  that was and is the best reference of its kind.	2000-07-31

Five or six tests are required, one of  which requires a 90% or above, and the rest require a grade of 75% or  better.  Many people have difficulty passing these tests--even experienced  sailors often have to retake the first test.<br />Gondor explains the process  well and gives you a foundation for passing these tests.  Do not think that  simply reading his book will give you everything you need to know to pass.  You will want to make up flash cards and drill yourself on the meaning of  lights, day shapes, and sound signals. You will also want to visit a test  site and get familiar with the location of the referenced volumes available  for use during the test.<br />I consider this book to be an essential  foundation for preparation for the Coast Guard License listed above strong  recommend this book for anyone interested in pursuing a USCG OUPV or above  license.	2000-07-31

Understand Unix and want to dig deeper into Solaris Admin?  Then this is the book for you.  I love this book--it is my new bible and I study it every chance I get.  Well written. I had been using Unix for a long time  but was weak in Sys Admin.  Partly because I didn't have a good reference.  Without a knowledge of the boot process, diaganostic tools, I felt I had a  major weakness in this area.  I looked around for a book that would fill  this need and was very happy to find this book. I especially liked the  chapter on setting up an Internet site.<br />I listed the index below, since  it's one thing I like to read before purchasing a book.

But don't expect to read it in just a few evenings.<br />The 63rd Edition should tell you something.  This is a huge text that has been  revised and improved many times.  I have three different editions spanning  35 years--including a recent one which had been moderized especially in the  area of electronics.<br />Many people might be daunted by the amount of  information in this book.  It is presented by topic and not necessarily by  the order you should learn this material.  If you think of it as a  reference and take it one bite at a time, and work your way through the  book, you will be a better seaman for it.<br />The text is suitable for both  power boaters and sailors, who own or operate small to large  yachts.<br />Having trouble docking?  Confused about anchoring?  Buy this  book.  The explanations for the use of spring lines alone are worth the  price of the book, and will help you keep your vessel intact.

Brian Toss's book can teach a beginner sailor more in 15 minutes just scanning the pictures than they could learn in years just knocking  around on boats.  If you are like me and think traditional rigging and  splicing is cool stuff, then you will love this book.<br />The book includes  some important basic things like sweating a halyard and less well known  things like how to use a marlinspike and why your lifelines should be left  a little loose, and more.  I was pleased to see a drawing of what I called  a bowline with a tucked tail--a more secure version of the bowline that I  haven't seen in any other text.<br />Much of the material is just not  applicable to newer yachts, but there are many illustrations of innovative  techniques that a modern self-reliant yachtman could use to replace, or  repair, things that break.  Reading this book will help you find solutions  to problems you will face at sea.<br />I don't think I saw anything relating  to rod rigging or any discussion of modern fibers and rope.  If you are  trying to rig a modern sailing yacht, and think this book is your solution,  you will be disappointed.<br />I guarantee you won't regret buying the book.	2000-07-28

The book takes you from a point in Jones' life where just finished hauling his boat up to &quot;naval of the world&quot;, lake Titikaka--the highest lake in the world in Peru.  Jones wanted to set a record as being the first  man to ever sail upon this lake--he at least is the first to make this  claim. The book picks up just after this and tells of a time where he eeks  out a living in Brazil.  He attempts and finally finds success selling a  story that finances his return to England.  He runs into difficulty with  the authorities there and decides to sail to New York City were he manages  to &quot;shoe-horn&quot; his diminutive boat &quot;Sea Dart&quot; into the  elevator of Waldorf Astoria.  He does this by cutting the cabin top off his  boat.  All this just so he could display it when he speaks of his  adventures to the Explorer's Club.<br />It is not a book about sailing. I was  looking to purchase a book about Tristan Jones sailing adventures.  I  learned very little about sailing when reading this book, because it was  about a period of time where Tristan was barely surviving in South America  trying to raise money to head to sea again.  It is not a bad book, but it  is not his best.  This should not be your first Tristan Jones book.  Don't  buy this if you want a book on sailing.  DO BUY this book if you want  insight in how it is to be poor in South America.  He tell of all sorts of  horrifible atrocities taking place, like murder and genocide.  I enjoyed  the book but found some portions disturbing.  I have to question it's  accuracy, simply because he was a poor and desperate man at the time.  Could he have embellished it to make the story easier to sell?  My feeling  is yes.  I took it with a grain of salt, and because of the disturbing  images, I doubt I'll re-read it.	2000-07-27

Instead of getting bogged down with too much material, this textbook gives you what you need to know when you first start sailing, and  nothing else. I've taught sailing for 16 years at five different sailing  schools.  I have used this book for teaching and strongly reccomend this  book for those who are just beginning to sail. As you advance in skills,  more advanced textbooks are available to take you from beginner to advanced  in meticulously planned stages.  Even if you already of strong sailing  skills, you can find and fill in the holes of your knowledge with this  series of books.  The fastest way to learn is to learn from the pro's.	2000-07-26

Nothing builds credibility faster onboard a boat.  Long ago I  decided to be better at knots than anyone else I knew.  It paid big  dividends.  This was my first choice for a knot book.  It is the book I  recommend to every one of my sailing students.  You will need two 6' pieces  of rope, of different thicknesses, a 20' or longer section for practice  coiling line.  Practice knots in front of your TV set during commercials.  It won't take any time out of your life and you will improve.  I still  carry my original practice line--a 35' piece of 6 mm line, in my life  jacket, which is always useful onboard.  So, learn how to tie these knots  consistently, and quickly--even with your eyes closed.  While you do it  keep in mind anything you tie should be easy to untie. The only thing I did  not like was author's method for coiling and crowning line.  It is pretty,  but too cumbersome to untie.	2000-07-26

Despite this, there is no question that the material within is critically important for any sailor who ventures  offshore and worth reading.  I feel this topic has not been adequately  explored in the printed media.  There are only three good books on the  subject and this book leads the pack.  There is still a lot of research to  be done in area of heavy weather sailing.  Coles does a good job explaining  what to do in various situations he faced.  This book gives you a chance to  put yourself in his shoes.  This book is well worth the price.  It is cheap  insurance considering that what you learn could save your life.  Serious  yachtsman read this book.	2000-07-26

I rate this one the best of the lot for an intro book.  It got me up to speed and productive in a UNIX development  envirnoment quickly.  It covers all the basics commands plus the C-shell.  There was no information on ksh.  It gives an overview of vi which I hate,  but did not mention textedit which is my choice for a GUI script editor.

This book is actually written by and for model ship builders.  I gave it a 5 star rating because of the difficulty finding information of this nature.  It is somewhat dry reading, but the diagrams are for the most part clear.  Some of the whole ship detailed drawings, lost something in the reduction  and are difficult to read.  Much of the information here came from the  authors detailed study of the St George model as well as impossible to find  rare book references from the late 1600's.<br />I love every aspect of sailing  and I'm particularly interested in learning whatever I can about how ship-  rigged boats were actually rigged.  This book provides some great  information on the terminology of the complicated rigging of these vessels,  as well as some of the construction details of the spars.  In it you will  find information on spars, proportions of the same, standing rigging, and  running rigging, and the spirtsail topmast (which went out of use after  1720).  If you are interested in learning everything you can about  square-rigged ships, this is one of the few references still in print.  Buy  one while you still can. I am very happy with the book.  Because of the  rarity of the information presented here it will not be the sort of book I  would loan out.	2000-03-08

Admiralty law was actually developed to protect boat owners and it is quite different in unexpected ways from the civil and  criminal laws you may be familiar with.  This book shows you what the  limits of your liability are.  The subject is complicated, but the author  does a good job of explaining things in laymans terms.
