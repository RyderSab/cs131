This is more than a little shocking since this is a Microsoft Press book, since MS press editions are usually competently written exam guides. However, the actual test, four long and complex case studies from which you must pick out network design factors based on hints in interviews, existing designs, network diagrams and future plans, has little in common with the content presented by this guide.  <br /> <br />This book summarizes everything you need to know about setting up a Windows 2000 network, but doesn't say a thing about WHY to choose one type of design over another. Much of the exam is about choosing between alternative design factors, which this MS book does not mention one word of. It has hundreds of sub-topics entitled \\"making the decision\\" but those are in fact nothing but re-statements of the technical content and are not about decision making at all. It is highly unlike that anyone could pass the exam using this book, it is merely a summarization of the topics covered in the \\"core four\\" 70-210 through 70-217 MS exam guides. <br />	2004-08-07

The class instructor had not chosen it (the institution had) and was unable to teach from it as were my fellow students and I unable to pass the exam from it.  Heldman likens himself to a technician's story teller of some sort, chatting on and on about the company he works for and it's network requirments, and asking you to compare them to your company and your network requirements, and sandwiched somewhere between all the layers of literary muck there is, possibly, information to help you pass the exam, if you can ferret it out. <br /> <br />This almost 900 page book would probably be only 500 pages if Heldman cleaned out the worthless, self indulgent trips down network memory lane and just presented the material needed to pass the exam.  People trying to get an MCSE ticket don't have time to waste wading through all the \\"fluff and stuff\\" in this tome.	2004-08-07

It's OK, but in consideration of the renewed interest in all things Hobbit brought about by the new movie series, this is really a very disappointing and lack-luster work.  The maps are unicolor (all shades of brown or tan) and flat - no attempts at topological representation anywhere - and have the &quot;look and feel&quot; of maps drawns for a college project rather than professional cartography.  Most of the text is reprinted from various Middle Earth stories with a few original comments from the author, but not much is added to the overall commentary of the Middle Earth.  The multiple errors in the maps are discussed in other reviews of this book, so I won't repeat that.<br />It is not a bad collection of line drawings of the geological features of the Middle Earth, but given the computer graphical imagery available to any college student today, it is far, far short of what it should be.	2002-06-25

Other images must have been chosen from children's editions of the Tolkien books and look like something the kids brought home from school art class currently hanging on the front of the refridgerator.  I don't know what politically correct art chic caused the editors to feel that had to balance the beauty with the crud, but it created a truely unfortunate blend of imagery.  It's an OK coffee table book for the Tolkien fan, but it could have been so much better if the editors had used their power to create a book of outstanding illustrations, rather than a collection representing all illustrators, even the artistically challenged ones.	2002-06-25

It has a nice leather-ish (NOT leather, mind you, just leather-ish) cover, and a nice leather-ish slipcase.  It has some graphics from the story badly misplaced (the runes from the enterance to Moria badly mangled to look like cover hinges) on the cover in silver leaf.  It's red (those familiar with the Hobbit stories would know that any IMPORTANT book is bound in red).  The paper is higher quality than a paperback but is far from top grade rag paper.  In has a map glued in the back which is bigger and nicer than any of the maps in any of the paperback editions I've seen.<br />It contains the exact same text, including all appendices as the low cost paperbacks, no more, no less.  If you want a nice red leather-ish book for the bookcase, this is as good as any.	2002-06-25

I couldn't find it, maybe you can.  The author rants on about coffee shops and lakes of Minnesota, doing his best to be like Garrison Keillor telling the &quot;Tales of Lake Wobegon&quot;, which may be entertaining in a detached way, but has absolutely no place in a test prep manual.<br />He is also obsessed with a book written by Bill Gates, and works it into his presented lessons, when even Microsoft doesn't try to make the Gate's book into an MCSE issue.<br />Clearly the author has lost the sense of mission in this manual, which is to help you get through the test, not entertain you (actually, I'm not sure the author actually entertains anyone except himself).<br />If you want to pass the test, stick with the Microsoft dull, boring training manual which actually has the info you need to pass the test.<br />This book was just a waste of money to me, it's too big to even hold up the leg of a wobbley table well.	2002-04-14

I used a number of study guides for the MSCE core exams, those I purchased and those I borrowed.  After each exam I reviewed the materials agin to try to find out where those often obscure and arcane test questions came from only to discover that the answers were ALL in these books.  Either the questions were developed from these books, or the books were developed from the exams, but it is an exact one-to-one match.  Unfortunately, despite the MS Press laudable but incomplete attempt to be user friendly, these things are horrible to plow through and difficult to stay awake reading.  You must have a W2K network at your fingertips at all times to make sense of the exercises.  There is no warning of what among the immense volume of material is the more important (i.e., likely to show up on the exam).  Its all just shoveled out in the same dry, boring manner and left to the reader to sort out.  Hint - the more obscure, the more unimportant seeming, the smaller the detail, the more likely it is to be important to passing the exam.<BR>I rate these with 5 stars, not because they are good, but because they are necessary.	2001-09-06

I have enjoyed Tolkien books for years.  I have attempted to finish this one for years.  I cannot get through it.  It is an epic poem, and like most straight men, I simply cannot get excited about the epic poetry literary form.  There are great stories of the Middle Earth embedded in this thing, probably as good as if not better than &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, but it's like a gold coin in the middle of a snake infested swamp - highly valuable, but not worth the effort to recover.

It falls short of a 5 star rating due to organization. Presenting the W2K concepts in alphabetical order is confusing and counter productive. It would have been far better done if the concepts had been organized in a logical hierarchy leaving the referred-to tasks, procedures and utilities in alphabetical order.

When was the last time anyone changed a resistor in a PC other than at the component manufacturer site?

This book hits on the concepts necessary for a 50,000 foot view of the MCSE but lacks anything like the detail necessary to actually sit at the exam terminal.  I rate it as high as I do only because I had diminished expectations of it from the start - its only a tenth the size of any other MCSE study guide, so how could it possibly cover everything?  The answer is that it doesn't come close.  None the less, I found its high level coverage of the subject to be extremely useful when I was completely lost in the deep details of the full coverage texts and needed a guide to show me the big picture of what was to be accomplished by those details.  I would recommend getting this and read each exam topic here first before digging into the serious books that are going to get you through the exams. Other reviewers here have detailed the technical errors in the books so I won't, but they were less encumbering to me in the manner that I used the book (as a general rather than a specific reference).

Well hold tight to your Elvish sword and cloak - this one will make you wonder just where you are and what you are doing here and how do you get out fast.  This history of the first age of the Middle Earth is more the companion novel to &quot;War and Peace&quot; than to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.  It is tough reading in half poetic prose told in the manner of verbal tales of Elvish lore and myth (What's that - you aren't familiar with the style of Elvish myth?  Neither was anyone until this was published - unless they read &quot;The Lost Tales&quot; which this is based on) and the characters change names as often as characters in Russian novels, so you need a notepad to keep up with the action - and speaking of action, expect to get it in small amounts between long passages of descriptive landscape or genelogy narritive - and figure out just who is annoying and/or killing who.  However, if you put up with it and hang in there, the entire background of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the ring trilogy will make a good deal more sense and you will come away feeling a closer bond to the Middle Earth.	2001-07-26

Now that I have a copy (which I will be returning shortly) I can only guess that those reviews were written by friends of the author. This book is little more but a long and rambling antidotal collection of PC repair stories roughly organized into general failing areas.  No symptom analysis, no error code explanations, no organized flowcharts of logical procedures, no tables of settings and types.  Just paragraph after paragraph of &quot;if you notice this, try that&quot;.  In my mind this should be called something like the &quot;Jeff Foxworthy you might be a redneck PC repair tech manual&quot;. However, if you are new to PC repair and have no idea where to start looking for the resolution of a problem, this MIGHT be just the book you need - because you can sit and thumb through it and look like you are doing something useful while you await the arrival of the guy who knows what he's doing.  You might even stumble on an antidote that actually applies to the problem you are currently experiencing.	2001-07-20
US	51988793	R36X0CIBWRLJWZ	0735710880	391204771	A+ Certification Training Guide (3rd Edition)	Books	2	8	8	N	Y	Its OK, not great, has some serious errors	First of all, if you study this book and learn everything it has to say, you will pass the A-plus.  If you order and study ANY of the A-plus exam guides you will pass the A-plus.  You will not ACE the A-plus from this book.  As near as I can tell, there is no study guide that will help you ACE the A-plus.  If you want to do that you have to buy several study guides and study them all, as well as check out the assistance available on the web.  However, this is a big, heavy expensive book and I expected more of it. What it does do - it will teach you how a PC works, how to build one, what the options are, how to fix one.  As far as core hardware, this book is guilty of giving you far more information than you need for the exam.  Its good for a real world repair guide and reference, but it may overload the entry level technician with just too much information. What it doesn't do - It hasn't been updated for the Windows 2000 focus of the new A-plus exam.  It mentions Windows 2000 when it can, but clearly as last minute updates as it was going to press.  Its woefully inadequate about this operating system.  It is also out of date in many other areas of lesser importance but which still could cost test points (for example - it states that Novell NetWare does not support IP protocols - this information is about four years out of date).  It also makes statements about Windows 95/98/NT/2000 that are just incorrect, just wrong.  Its clear that the authors are less knowledgeable about operating system software than they are about PC hardware. The last disappointment is the self-testing CD included with the book.  The testing program has had the guts ripped out of it, but for a substantial fee you can obtain the secret code to restore it to full functionality.  Its of very little value and follows the technical errors made in the text. Again, the book does have enough correct information to get you through the A-plus exams with a passing grade.  But a number of other books found on Amazon do the same thing at lower cost.	2001-07-20
US	51988793	R25L9ETAVPBCEH	094133256X	545103180	Scuba Diving Explained: Questions and Answers on Physiology and Medical Aspects of Scuba Diving	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Clears up a lot of misinformation you learned in dive class.	My experience is that dive instructors, dive guides, dive shop owners, and all of the other dive professionals you trust your health to to some degree or another are generally clueless about the actual medical aspects of diving and dive medicine.  Generally they have formed opinions which often are based on erronous data and frequently contradict one another.  The only way to really understand the effects of diving on your body is from the writings of an expert with sufficient quantities of research behind him.  There may be other books that do this, but this is the only one I've found so far.  If you don't already own a good dive medicine guide, I would like to recommend this one to you.  It is not for doctors or paramedics, it is for divers who want to know what is really going on inside their bodies and the proper response for when something goes wrong.  Ever diver should have some good medical reference and should have all of the significant parts memorized, because if you cannot depend on yourself in a medical dive emergency, those jokers running the boat will kill you for sure.	2001-06-07
US	51988793	R1KRL7NQ5DLK2E	0394519140	142015284	The National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Butterflies	Books	5	30	30	N	Y	Up to the usual Audubon Society high standards	I use both Audubon Society and Petersons small wildlife identification guides and find that are quite good with their own plus and minuses.  Petersons is better for taking into the field for things that move (animals and insects) due to the layout which allows for quicker identification.  Audubon is better for things that can't get away (plants) and with animals and insects, for obtaining data about the creature's habitat.  This guide is as good as any other in their series, which is to say that it is very good.	2001-06-07
US	51988793	RWECFIS3OTWAN	0932248012	792300419	Scuba Equipment Care and Maintenance	Books	1	29	30	N	Y	What a disappointment.  Save your money.	When you bought your equipment at the dive shop, did you ask the sales clerk how to take care of it?  Well, unless you completely forgot the answer, this book adds nothing new.  Same old, same old, common sense gear care, things like rinse it off after a salt water soak, don't leave rubber in the sunlight.  If you were expecting any really interesting information, like the gauges needed to properly set the breathing pressure on a regulator, forget it, all you get is the tired old &quot;better left to factory trained representatives&quot; rhetoric.  This guy assumes that the average diver has never seen a screwdriver or wrench in their life and cannot possibly adjust or repair anything more challenging than a flashlight.  Unless you have two left thumbs and zero mechanical aptitude, you don't need this book.	2001-06-07
US	51988793	R2GJRJQQZW7TT9	0395911761	564418180	A Field Guide to the Birds: A Completely New Guide to All the Birds of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides(R))	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Among the best for identification	I use both Peterson and Audubon guides for identifying wildlife, and I find that while they are both quite good, Petersons are better for rapid identification of something that just went buy in a flash.  Peterson guides are much better at pointing out the key differences that distinguish one species from another, making it a better aid for rapid identification.  This book is as good as any other in the Peterson series, which is to say that it is very good.	2001-06-07
US	51988793	R2GXE27928XX2Y	0316341517	79911364	Mythology	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	An old classic that belongs on the reference shelf.	I bought this to answer questions and settle arguments about Greek and Roman mythology in various word-based game forums.  It is a classic and a standard reference.  It does little with any mythology of non-mediterranean people.	2001-06-06

If you haven't seen or didn't like the show, I can't imagine why you would want this.	2001-06-06
US	51988793	R3GLI7WSE2TQNO	015668568X	831494069	Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	A nice book for &quot;CATS&quot; fans.	I am not a poetry fan and therefore my purchases of poetry books are few and far between.  I purchased this after seeing the musical &quot;CATS&quot; and wanted to know the origin of the &quot;CATS&quot; story.  This book is that origin and I enjoyed it for that reason.  If you haven't seen or didn't like &quot;CATS&quot;, you probably won't like this.	2001-06-06

A number of the ideas and programs are extremely useful for adapting to the economic climite of the 21st century.  A very good read for anyone still trying to make their way in the economic jungle, which I suppose is everyone other than Bill Gates and Warren Buffet.  However, Pollard does make a mistake common to self-help authors by insisting that you must do EVERYTHING he recommends if you are to have any sucess with the program at all.  I don't believe this &quot;one size fits all&quot; philosphpy does the reader any kindness or any help.  I think it has a great selection of useful &quot;how to&quot; topics but one must pick and choose among them to find a system customized to your needs and desires.  Other than that, it is a very excellent work.	2001-06-06
US	51988793	R2KC098OO85ZRV	094133256X	545103180	Scuba Diving Explained: Questions and Answers on Physiology and Medical Aspects of Scuba Diving	Books	5	17	18	N	Y	Scuba Diving - Part 2 - After Open Water	This is an excellant and informative book for those who have completed their open water certification, or otherwise understand the basics of SCUBA diving, and quest for additional information on health and SCUBA diving.   In here you find the answers to many issues chatted about on boats and in  front of dive shops, and for which most beginning divers usually get the  incorrect information.  It is not for the uncertified masses as it assumes  a basic understanding of open water SCUBA and it is not for those  experienced divers who have kept current via magazines and speciality  courses, as most of the information within has been available in magazines  such as DAN's Alert Diver and UnderCurrent.  Well, maybe even experinced  divers who want single source for all that information rather than a file  folder of old articles.	1999-12-05
