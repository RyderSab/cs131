I am so excited about this book, it has taken my amature drawings to the look of professional, and all I had to do was devote 3 hours one night with the book and a photo.  Ms. Parks breaks drawing portraits down the way all other books have failed.  A few \\"secrets\\" and you can draw any face.  Think features are hard to draw and it's a matter of luck if you get it right?  (I did) Ms. Parks shows you how to measure a face and once you have that everything else falls into place.  Spend some time with this book and I promise you won't regret it and it makes no difference what your skill level is.  I wish all art books were like this one!  Bravo Ms. Parks!	2005-10-06

This book has a lot of history in it and being a history buff I found it really enjoyable.  I've learned a great deal about the subject and was really suprised to find how much we are actually exposed to poisons on a daily basis.  I was worried that perhaps this may be a rather dry book, but let me assure you it isn't.  I found it very entertaing and would recommed it to anyone who has an interest in history or reading about true crime.  Or even if you just want to make your boyfriend nervous!	2005-09-20

Not liking the pastels very much at first I decided to do a little work on my own.  This book was invaluable!  This is such a great book to start off with.  Not only does it teach you about the medium itself, it also goes into color theory and the reasons for choosing certain colored papers to convey the feeling of the painting.  Along the way I learned a great deal, but most importantly was not that I couldn't use the pastels, it was the pastels I was using were not very good, hence my frustration with them.  I went out and bought some good pastels and worked my way through this book.  I don't regret it.  This book really inspired me to do more.  I even took it to class and we did one of the lessons!  This book is well worth more than the price.	2005-09-11

This is a good book for anyone, at any stage in of learning, as eveything in the book will present itself eventually as you continue to learn drawing. It's not a wealth of info on one subject, but rather a page or two dedicated to explaining the process and then showing an example.  If you want to learn to draw reflections on water, or how to draw glass or just get an idea of what you can accomplish, this is a great place to start.	2005-08-31

Having worked with pastels and finding I didn't like them, I decided to explore colored pencil.  I don't think I could have found a better book!  However, the title although not misleading, but perhaps confusing.  If you are a beginner, in the sense that you have never picked up a pencil and want to learn to draw, and think this book will show you, it won't.  Put it on your wish list until you are ready for it, and check out some books on drawing.  I like Betty Edwards and Lee Hammond.  If you already have some drawing skill, even very basic, then this is a great book to get into the world of color.  This book is more of a technique than a how-to.  I've found it very inspiring.  However, no matter how good a book is, nothing can replace art lessons from a good teacher.  If you are truly a \\"serious beginner\\" sign up for a class and use this book as a supplement at home.	2005-08-12

The fact that the author spent 10 years dedicated to her subject and the effort she put into researching it really shows through.  It's a very enjoyable read, and a difficult subject to revamp (no pun intended).  How many vampire stories can one read without it being redundant?  This is an itellegent book.  If you want blood and guts, don't read it.  IF you want to enjoy a book at the same time learning a great deal about Vlad the Impaler and the whole history of his time, then this is a book you will enjoy.	2005-07-11

I loved the DaVinci Code, but after hearing all the issues the book had with the actual historical facts, I decided to find out the truth for myself.  This book was great introduction to the facts without being over my head.  As a matter of fact, I lent it to a friend who hadn't read the DaVinci Code, but after I told her about the book she wanted to read it anyway.  You don't have to read the DaVinci Code to get a great wealth of info from this book.  As a matter of fact, I wish I had read this book first.  Now that I have I am going to go back and re-read the DaVinci Code.  There are a great number of books out there about \\"the facts\\" and I have read many of them.  This is the first book I would recommend.	2005-07-09

Except one the dreaded broccoli.  Much to my chagrin, my boyfriend came home from the store one day (I will never let him go alone again) and proudly showed me the very LARGE head of broccoli he bought, because, yes ladies, you know, it was on sale.  After glaring at him and letting out a big sigh, I reached for Mark's book and found a recipe that I thought I could at least tolerate.  I took one bite out of it and was hooked, now I'm the one bringing home the broccoli, so to speak. So thank you Mark Bittman, you not only showed me broccoli can be good, you may have also saved my boyfriend's life.  Honestly, this book really does have everything in it.  Even recipes for cocktails.  Your kitchen isn't complete without it.	2004-11-14

Penman's Welsh Trilogy along with her other books are really quite superior to her mysteries.  With that said, the mysteries are a good read and written well, but if you are expecting it to grab you like her other books you will be disapointed.  Perhaps it's because they are shorter in length and you don't get quite as attachted to Justin as you can Richard III or Simon de Montfort or  either of the Llewelyns.  Maybe because Justin isn't based on a real person from history.  You will enjoy the book as long as you don't expect it to be like her other books.	2004-10-24

If you like Anne Perry you will enjoy this book. Henry Morton is very similar to William Monk.  However this book didn't quite have the \\"feeling of the era\\" like Perry's books do.  A good read, but a little short of what I was expecting.	2004-10-24

For once we are able to see him as human, not as the monster he's been so often portrayed as.  This book was spellbinding!  It is written so beautifully that as I came closer to the time of Richard's death, I found myself reading it slowly as I was dreading it.  I acutally felt an attachment to this Richard and felt remorse at losing him.  There are very few books that have moved me like this one did.	2004-03-17
