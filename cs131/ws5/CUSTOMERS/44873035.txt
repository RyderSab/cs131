But these reviews aren't like those in Roger Ebert's \\"The Great Movies\\", which have the advantage of hindsight. These 1,000 articles were written fresh off the openings of the movies and show initial, at the moment reactions. Of course, in the years and decades since their releases, people's opinions may vary from those presented here. But you have to praise the Times for having the guts to republish their reviews to praise their correctness and admit their mistakes (In my opinion). <br />The New York Times was the only newspaper I know of that praised \\"Citizen Kane\\" when it was first released in 1941. I like this because it showed that the most distinguished paper in the country wasn't going have their opinions decided by the Hearst Empire. They also knew \\"Casablanca\\" was something special when it premiered in 1942. There were also films, like \\"Gone With the Wind\\", \\"The Godfather\\", \\"West Side Story\\" and \\"Titanic\\" that the Times, along with much of the country, knew were instant classics. <br />But they seemed mixed on now classic films like \\"Double Indemnity\\", \\"Laura\\" and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". For the most part they found good things about them, but either didn't like the characters or, in the case of \\"2001\\", couldn't figure out what was going on. There was also a batch of films they were entertained by, but didn't think would be judged among the best movies in 2002. These include \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" and \\"The Third Man\\". And they were underwhelmed by \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" (Not so much underwhelmed as disturbed), \\"Psycho\\", \\"Paths of Glory\\", \\"Chinatown\\", \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" and even \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". While I don't exactly agree with them always, the critics argue their opinions well and one can see where they're coming from. After all, most of the country was shocked by \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" or \\"Psycho\\" upon their debuts. But if a small town critic like Roger Ebert saw \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" in a different light at the time, then why not a big town critic? And this shock must have eventually worn off, for they seemed to like \\"The Wild Bunch\\" just two years after \\"B &amp; C\\".  <br />About the only compliant I had was some of the times reviewers seemed to be uptight or expecting too much while reviewing movies (What critic isn't?). For example, Bosley Crowther was the one who disliked \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", yet was mesmerized by \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" five years earlier. This is understandable, since \\"Bridge\\" was almost impossible for any follow-up film by David Lean to have toppled. Yet, at the same time, many critics were bowled over by \\"Lawrence\\". Was Crowther the only one wrong or the only one right? His major complaint seems to be that we know little more about Lawrence at the end then we do at the beginning. But was Lean's point trying to be that Lawrence was a man that no one can ever fully know about or understand? If so, Crowther missed it. <br />Otherwise, this is an interesting read that will leave you with various feelings. Some of total agreement, some of absolute disagreement, but often a mix of both.	2002-07-07
US	44873035	R2BCX580JPTJBZ	076791032X	141760283	The Great Movies	Books	5	36	39	N	N	What makes a movie great?	As I was reading some of Roger Ebert's essays in this book, a thought occurred to me: All the movies in this book could have been failures for one reason or another. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was very costly and troubled and could have been easily ruined. \\"2001\\" might have been too different for audiences to handle. \\"Psycho\\" might have been too much for them to stomach. And some of these movies in the book were not as renowned upon their original release and seemed doomed for obscurity. And so on. Yet, after years of research and analyze by critics, all of these are now acclaimed films.<br /> The reason is not due to a memorable scene or a witty catchphrase (Which all the above-mentioned films have). It is because of the passion involved in making them. Many of the people working on these movies became so involved in them that they would die just to finish the film, and would drive others mad in the process. Many of them were also willing to try something new or not give in to peer pressure or criticism. And some, like the late Billy Wilder, said they only made films that they wanted to see. The involvement in the film extends beyond the director and into the actors. The actors have fun with their roles, trying out new techniques and becoming so involved with the character that they become him. Let's take for example a catchphrase, such as \\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\\". The line has entered largely into our lives so much that we take it for granted. Yet I am still moved whenever I hear it said by Marlon Brando. Yet, had it not been for the correct timing, tone of voice, rate of speech and pronunciation (All due to acting and direction), it could have been easily wasted. <br />Ebert never really states this in his book, but he seems to be making that point across just by glancing at any review. He shows that same involvement in his writing. Some critics when they write reviews only outline the film's plot and say things like \\"Good acting\\" or \\"Great music\\" and that's it. Many also have that star rating system. Ebert does away with that ridiculous system, thus leaving the films open to balanced reviews, and tells about more than the events. In some of his reviews, he points out about a certain method an actor is using on screen or about how this scene is lit or filmed or what the director is doing to us in here or how sound and music are used. It may seem like overkill, but it sure shows that he was really paying attention.  <br />The Great Movies does have two problems though, both of which have ups and downs. <br />1. Naturally, one would have disagreement with the selections. Ebert not only makes predictable and defined choices (Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Godfather) but also unexpected ones (Gates of Heaven, Night of the Hunter, My Life to Live). I must also say that I hadn't heard of many of these movies before getting this book. However, this also shows how more balanced the list is than say the AFI's Top 100 (Though I would have included films like \\"Touch of Evil\\" or \\"King Kong\\"). As explained above, the fact Ebert writes with enthusiasm would make people want to see them more.  <br />2. The reviews are very well written and accessible to the public and are arguably the best of Ebert's career. But they are not brand new. In fact, they can be obtained free off the Internet at the Ebert Page of the Chicago Time website, along with dozens of other reviews for the \\"Great Movies\\" series. Many of them have been available in this capacity for years. Certainly, Ebert could have written at least some reviews exclusive to the book to compensate for this. However, one must admit that it's easier to bring a book to the video store to look for movies than to haul your computer or laptop. Ebert also somewhat makes up for this by having a film still from each movie in his essays. There are also two introductions: One by Mr. Ebert and the other by Mary Corliss (Operator of the Film Stills Archive of the Department of Film and Media atthe Museum of Modern Art in New York). <br />Overall, with its wide variety of film genres, balance of contemporary and vintage films and the well written and easy to read reviews, this is a very good book.    ...	2002-04-20

The films examined in this book are his most well known and cover his various themes about humanity: \\"Fail Safe\\" machines going haywire (Dr. Strangelove), the dehumanization of men into machines and vice versa (2001, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket) and man in collision with destiny and the past (Barry Lyndon, The Shining). <br />To date, this is the only major book made with the cooperation of Kubrick himself. The photographs in each chapter are taken from still frames from the actual films. The author provides brief summaries for each photograph, showing its use of lighting, camera placement or relation to another Kubrick film (Slow Motion shots, light used is from the light source one would expect at the actual location). <br />According to the author, anything in Kubrick's movies has symbolism or some meaning to it, and this is where the book's only flaw is. Camera angles, lighting, set design and decoration even phrases numbers and placements of objects can be interpreted to have some meaning. He also has interesting ideas about the movies (One of my favorites is his belief that the soldiers in Full Metal Jacket's boot camp are lab mice being experimented and reconditioned on). However, this can also be very, very helpful to understand the films more. The author shows that each Kubrick film can have more depth than meets the eye (If you still think \\"2001\\" is only about boredom, you need this book). Just make sure you have seen the movies before reading for there are major plot spoilers.	2002-03-16

A Six-Engined monster, it was the first intercontinental bomber, being the only plane that could fly from allied bases to targets in Russia and back without refueling. While some books have been written about the plane, it can be said that Jacobsen has written the definitive account. <br />Early chapters detail the development of the plane, while later chapters discuss the aircraft's service life, including the controversies that it caused. There are also chapters devoted to spin-offs of the plane (The XC-99 transport, The YB-60 bomber), experimental versions, defensive armaments and to surviving aircraft or parts. There is even a chapter about the B-36's film career. <br />Dozens of former crewmen provided interviews on their experiences with the B-36, covering many parts of the plane and its use. There are also hundreds of photographs and illustrations throughout the book, many of them taken by the people who served on the plane. <br />This is only a basic coverage of what this book provides. You must read it for yourself. Just be sure you can afford the hefty price tag.	2002-03-07

There have been many books published on the legendary B-17 bomber. But most of them cover the combat history of the plane, devoting only a chapter or less to the post war use of the planes and to the surviving aircraft. \\"Final Cut\\", on the other hand, is different. The book focuses solely on the non-combat use of the fortress, in roles Boeing designers never imagined the aircraft would do. Uses of the planes in the military such as target drones, air sea rescue and experimental work are shown. Civil uses include fire bombers, air mapping and transports (One plane even served with the CIA). There is also coverage of the planes that weren't so lucky and even discussion of Hollywood movies featuring B-17s such as \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\" and \\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\". <br />But where this book really shines is in the survivors. There are a few pages devoted to each survivor, with text and photographs explaining about the individual plane. The text of each section details the plane's use during and after its military service and eventual concludes with its current whereabouts and condition. The photographs help cover the lives of planes such as \\"Memphis Belle\\", \\"Shoo Shoo Baby\\", \\"Sentimental Journey\\", \\"Nine O Nine\\" and \\"Fuddy Duddy\\". Overall, a great source for millitary and avation buffs alike.	2002-03-07

I bet that the author probably came up with this story as she was making a meal and wondered what happened if she never had to cook, but had someone else do it for her. She then created the tiny town of Chewandswallow, which is supplied its meals by the weather. At first, the town is happy and well supplied. But, ironically, mother nature shows who is boss and turns against the town, forcing the people to have to leave. One page after another is full of inspired creativity (The open roof restaurants, the sanitation department, the way people evacuate the city and so forth). Perfect for all ages.

It also shows that wars aren't fought only against the enemy, but against ourselves. They are fought on the bases against clashing egos and people with no sense and those with too much sense. A person who would enjoy this book doesn't have to be just a fan of war novels. A book like this can appeal to a vast number of persons because it is so fun to read. It can also appeal to those who like the unusual and thought provoking.   <br />Yossarian is a bombardier who seems to be the wrong person in the wrong squadron. When he censors letters, he cuts about everything out and signs the aliases `Irving Washington' or `Washington Irving'. When he presented with a medal, he marches down the ramp naked. But it seems every time Yossarian is close to completing his tour of duty, the mission number is raised by five. While many crews in other squads are going home at 50 missions, Yossarian's group is at 80 and counting. So Yossarian decides enough is enough and refuse to fly more missions. This creates quite a stir between him and his superiors. This creates chaos in the squadron with the threat others will soon refuse to fly. Yossarian offered a deal: He can return back to the states and no one would have known about this or, due to insubordination, desertion, cowardice in the face of the enemy and several other charges, he will be court-martialed. We see various colorful characters throughout the book, including General Dreedle, Colonel Korn, Colonel Cathcart, Lieutenant Scheisskopf, Nately, Hungry Joe, Major ------ de Coverley, Nately's whore kid sister and Major Major, among many others. Not many of these characters have importance to the text. However, some of them make the book more fun to read and others add to the backdrop.  <br />\\"The enemy,\\" retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, \\"is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.\\" <br />This quote (Which also appears in theamzon.com review above) is important in that it shows the two sides of which war is fought. For example, the number of missions is continually raised by the squadron's commanding officers, thus increasing the squadron's chances of getting killed. The quote also shows the meaningless of war. Why should you care about who wins if you are dead? Or who is really the enemy in war? <br />I wasn't sure as to what style Heller used. The book is not organized confusingly, but its tone changes throughout. We are presented with thrills, drama, horror and humor. Perhaps this is meant to show how well mixed our own lives are It can be called an anti-war novel, but unlike Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, Catch-22 is a satire. There are some audiences that may not like Catch-22. Like I said, it has varying changes of attitude plus has somewhat explicit content concerning sex and language. Also, the novel has rather large cast of people and not all of them have importance to the story line. Nevertheless, except for romance and possibly mystery, Catch-22 has enough elements to appeal to a wide audience. <br />I have tried to review Catch-22, but I think that no one review can fully comprehend Heller's work. I'm sure that there is some more depth in the novel than I have touched on in this analysis. The novel has to be read and read again and again before it is fully understood. But this is what good novels should do. Catch-22 I liked because I like war novels and because it leaves much to think about. If there is something to dislike about it, it seems to me that the book's end leaves an open gap, possibly for a sequel that never came. Also, at over 400 pages, this is a very long read and takes some getting into. But once you do, the book doesn't stop and delivers in whole. Thus, I recommend Catch-22 (And would give it ten stars if possible) for its anti-war message, its themes about humanity and for the fact it's just so fun.	2002-02-27
US	44873035	R3GG9MUPJCYYXC	0385303327	25497174	Alternate Oscars	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A revised opinion on Alternate Oscars	When I wrote my previous review for this book, I was writing from memory. I also was influenced by some opinions from other reviewers. But after reviewing the book, I have to say that it isn't that bad. It depends upon who is reading. <br />When they were originally founded in the late 1920's, the goal of the Academy Awards was to honor films and actors/actresses on the grounds of merit. This was difficult enough to achieve with a group of about a dozen voters, considering especially that they had power and influence. But overtime the academy grew to hundreds and even thousands of members. With such a large group of different people and personalities, it's safe to say that many have been influenced in their decisions by other reasons beside merit: Sentimentality, politics, consolation for a previous defeat and, most importantly, an obsession with prestige. In addition, silent movies were ignored during the transition to sound movies and certain film genres (Comedies and Westerns predominately), as well as independent and foreign films have been largely ignored over the years. If these factors did not exist in the minds of the academy voters, the results would be far different. <br />Author Danny Peary has realized this. As a result, he has gone back through Oscar history and rewritten the results, awarding Alternate Oscars to different winners, occasionally giving them to the actual academy choices. While some choices are the predictable ones (\\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"Casablanca\\"), Peary mostly tries to surprise us as much as possible in his selections, providing reasons for his choices and analyses of the films. In addition, so has to honor the contributions of others, \\"Award Worthy Runners Up\\" are included for every year (Although there are sometimes none). <br />Another area the book works at is in the disagreement with the decisions. For example, I like the much-acclaimed union drama \\"On the Waterfront\\". But Mr. Peary took away it's 1954 Best Picture Oscar and awardedit to \\"Salt of the Earth\\", another film about labor workers. While I may disagree, I have not seen \\"Salt of the Earth\\" and am now intrigued at watching it. If I hadn't read this book, that might not have happened.<br />There are a few complaints with the book, though minor. A few of your favorite stars (Burt Lancaster for example) might not have received Alternate Oscars. But the author apologizes for this at the book's introduction. Also, no Best Picture selection is made for 1963 (The author citing a lack of great films). Finally, the selections only go up to 1991. Hopefully, a second edition is in the works. It would be fascinating to see what Peary would have to say. Or who knows? Maybe another critic could share their two cents on the Academy. How about several critics on the same book? But one thing is for certain: for as long as the Academy continues to blunder, there will always be a place for critics like Danny Peary. Thank you very much. <br />(I would also like to make a correction on my previous review. Mr. Peary's selection as 1976's Best Picture was Woody Allen's \\"The Front\\", not \\"The Accused\\".)	2002-02-11

It was not a bad choice. This is a very extensive book on the making of Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi masterpiece. There are dozens of photographs in both color and black and white that show images from the movie as well as a look at the making of it. There are sketches of the spacecraft in the movie, which were drawn up from film stills, as well as pre-production sketches of some of the earlier design models. There is also an interesting introduction by Arthur C. Clarke, who wrote the novel and co-wrote the screenplay. Finally, the text is well detailed and informative. For those of you who do not want to know how the groundbreaking special effects were made, stay away from this book! Model work, live action and stunt work formed the key elements of most of the visual effects work. <br />The book also discusses about how it was like to work with Stanley Kubrick. Most cast and crew admit that it was difficult but rewarding because Kubrick pushed them to their limit and made them work better. Kubrick did get mad at them, but he rarely yelled at them. He also got respect because he knew what he wanted and would not stop until he got it. Kubrick was also a perfectionist; after his work on Spartacus, he was determined to have full creative control over his movies and worked over every aspect of his films, demanding the absolute best from the people who worked for him. Stressful no doubt. But this is what made Kubrick one of the best and acclaimed filmmakers of all time. His genius and ambition shows in 2001: A Space Odyssey and this book is a superb tribute	2001-11-13
US	44873035	R1TLEPZ20CIH4N	0449213943	15707610	All Quiet on the Western Front	Books	5	2	2	N	N	War. What is it good for?	On the first page of this novel is a message:<br />This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even thought they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.<br />A group of boys (Lead by Paul Baumer) has enlisted into the German army during the First World War. Believing that they will find glory and having the honor of serving the Fatherland (Germany in this case), the boys go to war. What they find however is no adventure, but rather a hell. Paul and his schoolboy friends are broken up on their first bombardment, as they find out that war will be far different from what their schoolmaster told them. But Paul is able to survive and get the strength to carry on from his friend \\"Kat\\" Katczinsky. Paul seems to look up at Kat as a role model. He is tough, hard-nosed and has been around for a long time. He and Paul are best of friends. We feel Paul's sorrow as he loses friend after friend in the trenches, with Kat being the last to go.<br />One of the book's best parts is when Paul is caught in a shell crater with a French Soldier. When the French soldier jumps in, Paul immediately stabs him. But, as the soldier lays dying, Paul is overcome with sorrow. He comforts the soldier and gives him water. He also begs for forgiveness for his killing of another brother. Sure, Paul was in a uniform different from the other man. But this doesn't mean he is different from the soldier he killed.<br />Another part deals when Paul goes on leave to home. He has become removed from the rest of civilization. He feels uncomfortable at his home with his mother and sister because they are so interested in the war. When Paul goes for a beer along with his father and friends, he is shown around as a tough warrior. He is also told to press on. Paul remarks at the end of this chapter \\"I should have never gone on leave\\". He realizes that the only place he feels comfortable at is the front, along with Kat and his other buddies.<br />A good point is brought up by a group of soldiers in the text. When one of them asks as to how wars begin, another replies \\"It occurs when one country offends another\\". One of the other soldiers then mentions \\"I don't feel offended\\". This shows that although they are supposed to be fighting for the Fatherland, they don't know why. This shows that although politicians generally start wars, it's common men like you and me who have to do the fighting. Often, we have no complaints with the other side. This could be linked with the recent World Trade Center bombing and with the events in Afghanistan. This is open for debate, but an excellent point has been made.<br />Paul is the protagonist. Through his experiences he learns to hate war, to hate the force of evil that makes men kill each other for no reason except that they're wearing different uniforms. Yet, the front destroys him mentally. He can no longer work as well around other people as he could have before the war. His new home is the front. Thus, we feel sympathy for him at how his life has been ruined by a meaningless war.<br />The book's antagonist, some might say, is war. Indeed, this would be an excellent choice. But how are wars caused? They don't just come out of nowhere. Some (Manufacturing, Generals, leaders) also benefit from wars. Thus, I think society is the antagonist in this story. The politicians and leaders create wars, but yet don't fight them by themselves, instead sending young boys to die and fight against an enemy they have no grudge with. On an ending note, one of the characters in the book suggests a good idea of how war should be fought. It should be a kind of sporting event, like a bullfight. In the arena, the ministers and generals of the two countries, dressed in bathing drawers and holding clubs, would have it out among themselves. The winning country is the one that survives.<br />If only our leaders were to listen.	2001-11-02

After seeing the excellent movies from Stanley Kubrick, I decided to read the novel, which it was based upon. Being out of print, it was difficult to locate. But I finally found a copy at a local library. It was worth searching.  <br />Paths of Glory was written by Humphrey Cobb and first published in 1935. Cobb, who had served in the Canadian Army during the First World War, wrote this novel as an anti-war statement. In my opinion, it's one of the best. Cobb shows an unpositive view of war. There are no heroes. Not even Regiment Commander Colonel Dax is the courageous man he was in Kubrick's film. He doesn't even have that big of a part.<br />French General Assolant is given orders by his Army Commander (Whose name is not revealed) to take an important German position called the Pimple. To take the \\"Pimple\\", Assolant calls the 181st regiment, which was supposed to be placed on leave. <br />We see the attack beforehand from the eyes of those on the battlefield. A patrol is sent out, where one of the men gets killed by the drunken commander due to a careless accident. The incident is covered up, but would play a part later.  <br />The next morning, the eargely anticipated attack on the Pimple is launched. It proves however to be impossible. The 181st is made up of a combination of battle weary vets and fresh new recruits to compensate for losses. Thus, casualties are high. The bombardment from artillery and machine guns also is so difficult to go through that many soldiers never even leave the trenches. Believing the men are mutinying, Assolant orders the battery commander to fire on the men. Fortunately, in what may be the only sensible act in the novel, the man refuses without a written order. Assolant then orders a court martial to preserved his dignity at the expense of others. <br />Four men are selected: One from each of the attacking sections. One section refuses to send a man but the other three select. The men are sent in front of a court-martial with a well-trained lawyer at their side. But it is really more of a Kangaroo Court. This is because the Indictment against the convicted is not read (\\"It basically states the accused are convicted of cowardice\\"), no Stenographic notes are kept of the trial, thus denying the convicted the possibility of a pardon, and the defense is not allowed to build its case. For example, when an attempt is made to call witnesses, it can only be \\"To prove that they made it to the enemy wire\\", which no one of the regiment did. And when the defense attempts to state the decorations one of the men has received (So it can be shown he isn't a coward) the president of the council says \\"The men are on trial for their current cowardice, not their former bravery\\" and that \\"Medals are no defense\\".  <br />What is most ludicrous is the line of questioning on the defendants. It is absurd in the way it forces the men to answer irrelevant questions. An example by the President of the council on the convicted Private Ferol:<br />President: Did you advance?<BR>Ferol: Yes, Sir. <BR>President: How far did you advance? <BR>Ferol: To about the middle of no man's land.<BR>President: Then what did you do?<BR>Ferol: Well, the Boche machine guns were like a hailstorm and I saw that-<BR>President: No. Answer my question. What did you do?<BR>Ferol: Well, sir, I saw that me and Meyer-<BR>President: I didn't ask you what you saw. I asked you what you did. <BR>Ferol: Yes, sir. <BR>President: Did you advance?<BR>Ferol: Not after I saw that me and Meyer-<BR>President: Did you turn round and go back?<BR>Ferol: Well, when I saw that-<BR>President: Attention! Answer my question. Did you turn round and go back? Yes or no?<BR>Ferol: Yes, sir. <br />This edition (Paperback, University of Georgia Press, 1987) includes a fascinating afterward by Stephen E. Tabachnick. He mentions about the book's placement of the chain of command and about themes from the book. <br />Sadly, Paths of Glory has become largely underrated over the years. My English teacher hadn't even heard of it. This book should be put back in publishing as soon as possible so more people can experience how great it is and should be recommended reading at schools so people can see how ridiculous war can be.	2001-10-23

They also believe The House on Mango Street is a masterpiece and a perfect example of Cisneros's talent. Having not read any of Cisneros other works, I can't make a judgment on her talent. I can say that my review title says it all. <br />Let me give you a little overview: Esperanza is a Hispanic girl who is unhappy with her life because she lives in a rundown house on a bad neighborhood. Now I would not know how it feels to live in a dilapidated house. But she should be grateful. It sure beats \\"The Cardboard Box on Mango Street\\". Esperanza also doesn't like her name. Now I admit that Esperanza might be a bad name (For her). But I think it is a great name. The other characters in the book think the same thing. The thing I liked about this plot line was how it reminded me of myself: I don't think I have a great name or that I'm good looking, but others seem to disagree. <br />The main reason I dislike this book is because it can get pretty tiresome talking about it for more than a month in English, analyzing it chapter by chapter, page by page, paragraph by paragraph. Most of the boys seem to dislike not because of the length (As far as books go, this is one of the shortest). Some might find more and more to appreciate as they delve into it, but some might just find only another stereotype of Hispanics. I didn't, but I can see how such a stereotype could be found.  <br />I don't mind the style the book is written in too much. Sure, there is no real structure and out of dozens of characters few have any importance or any major role. But there are a lot of movies and other books written this same way. In a way, this writing style reflects life, in how we pass by people every day that we are bound to never meet again. However, I can understand how this approach is disliked and even loathed by others. But, at the most, this book can only bore you. If my diary were published, people would have to get drunk after reading it and I would be recommended to a mental institute.  <br />So by all means read House on Mango Street. It has some good parts and is rather interesting because of the creative way it is written. Just don't believe all ghettos are populated by perverted males and females are always the innocent ones. Now, to read other Cisneros books to make a judgment on her talent.	2001-10-17

The six-month long battle for the island would be one of the definitive battles of the war. It was also one of the costliest. Thousands of Allied and Japanese soldiers died. And a channel north of the island had so many ships go down there that it was renamed Iron Bottom Sound. <br />It is possible that more men died in the waters off Guadalcanal then on the island itself. But for many years, most of the ships were out of reach to divers and eventually were all but forgotten. Then, in 1992, Oceanographer Robert Ballard, who had found the Titanic and the Bismarck, decided to explore the area using the latest in technology. It is quite an experience to see a past battlefield on land like Normandy, Pearl Harbor, Gettysburg or Guadalcanal itself. But the battlefields were obviously cleaned up afterward and don't look the way they did when the battle concluded. But time knows no boundaries in Iron Bottom Sound. The paintings by Ken Marshall and the photographs show many of the ships still upright on the ocean floor; Their guns and torpedo tubes still trained outward as if firing at a long gone enemy. But some of the ships are not so beautifully preserved. The Battleship Krishima, for example, lies upside down in two pieces on the ocean floor. And the Destroyer Barton is broken in half and lying on its side from two torpedoes. Nevertheless, most of the ships appear ready to rise up and continue fighting. <br />Lavishly illustrated and with a detailed text, The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal will make a welcome addition to the collection of any War, Naval or Shipwreck enthusiast (If you can find a copy that is).	2001-09-15

I have not read the book completely yet. But I have skimmed through it and some of the text is rather detailed. Ballard talks about the battle, the participants, and the outcome and, if anyone's been to them, what the \\"Graveyards\\" are like at the bottom of the Pacific. Ballard even describes as to what he thinks some of the graveyards yet to be found should look like. He also tells as to why he hasn't explored these \\"Graveyards\\" yet. <br />As usual, there are photographs of both past (The battle as it was when it happened) and present. As always, the photographs of the ships on the bottom of the sea are the book's best. <br />So where does this book fail? There is some artwork, but not much is of the shipwrecks. Also, the book has fewer wreck photos then Ballard's previous works. I especially wanted to see more photos of Guadalcanal, Truk Lagoon, and of Bikini Island. I also would have liked to have seen more photos of the ships as they appeared before they were sunk. <br />So people who liked how Dr. Ballard's previous works were populated with photographs might be disappointed by this recent work. But Graveyards of the Pacific is packed full of information and would make a great present for the Naval Historian in your home. Let's hope that Dr. Ballard next produces a book on his recent expedition to Pearl Harbor.	2001-06-09

So, finally, I bought it. <br />This has to be a great book on the 1998 blockbuster film. It contains information on all subjects from the film's genesis to final production. Hundreds of lavish photographs and drawing make it even better. It includes interviews with the cast and crew. <br />However, for people looking for a good book to read, ignore this. The information skips back and forth. One moment they are telling you about how the film began. Then they are telling you about how the special effects were made. Then they are telling about the genesis and so forth. But the lack of definite timeline does not at all hurt the story of the most overcritized film of all time.

Seeing has to how I am an aircraft nut (Mostly military), I got a kick out of the fact that all the pictures were color! And the photos are almost all of aircraft. Rare aircraft included are the XB-19, B-36,  RA-5C, C-133 and the NB-52E. The only problem is that just one photo of each of the above aircraft is in the book.    In addition, the book also has details about how the aircraft are preserved in storage and what uses they have at the yard. Not all are scrapped or salvaged of parts, but some go on to civilian lives as firebombers or transports and some are sold to warbird collectors. For example, The Pima Air-Space Museum has many aircraft that are on loan from D-M (Then again, it is very near the base). This has to be the best book ever on the place that is mistakenly called \\"The Boneyard\\".	2001-04-16

But, of all his novels, the most wondrous, the most well known, the most popular and the best is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.<br />The book's plot is pretty well known to the literature world: Captain Nemo has built an underwater ship called the Nautilus.  Three people land on the ship and are taken aboard: French Professor M. Aronnax, a famous French scientist, Conseil, his servant and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Some of the highlights of their incredible adventure include getting trapped under ice in the South Pole, battling giant squid, exploring lost shipwrecks as well as the lost city of Atlantis and encountering the undersea forests of Crespo.<br />What is most amazing is that Verne's predicted how subs would work years later. Also, the U.S.S Nautilus went under the South Pole almost a century after Verne's Nautilus. The book is however not problem proof. It takes a while to develop. The Nautilus is originally mistaken for a sea monster. So a few are spent looking for this \\"Sea Monster\\". But this is forgivable. For can you name one great book that doesn't spend time developing its plot?	2001-04-03

A very good book for the study of warplanes. My only problem is there's no F-117, F-22, or B-2 in this book. Then again, this book was published before those aircraft were declassified.

I had liked the books &quot;20,000 leagues under the sea&quot; and &quot;Around the world in 80 days&quot;. So I was expecting a good book. This book is magnificant. It takes a while before the team finally starts down to the center of the earth. But one good thing about this is the fact they don't use a drill to go down (They hike instead). Also, sorry to ruin the book, but they don't even make it to the center of earth. The book however is still enjoyable.

Nevertheless, this book contains excellent info on almost all the monsters that have co-starred with Godzilla over the years.

American Eagles is a history of the United States Air Force, the world's most powerful air arm, from the Wright Brothers to Desert Storm.

It does contain photographs of aircraft from the U.S. Air Force Musuem. But most of them are of sections of the aircraft. Only a few are shown complete in the pictures. The book also does contain a history of the musuem, but only a two page writing part and some pictures. For info on the Air Force musuem, don't get this.
