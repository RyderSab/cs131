This book makes the reader think it will contain some great revelation, but in the end i found it quite disappointing.  The author ignores all the work that has been done to show that evolution can occur in a test tube at a molecular level.  If you are going to attack the theory of natural selection, and the factual evidence of evolution, then really, biochemistry is precisely the worst place to try to do it, because the evidence in favor of the power of natural selection is simply so clear.  But none of this is cited in the book, quite conveniently for the author.  Perhaps most disappointing, the author ignores the obvious point that in many cases the current design of animals is NOT always optimal, suggesting that if they were designed, it was not done  in an intelligent way.  The \\"theory\\" presented here cannot pass its own test.	2005-03-15

By making each side of the argument clear, Berra makes it easy for the reader to see the difference between argument based on evidence, and argument based on a desire simply to oppose a theory that some find unpleasant.  Even people with a strong education in biology may sometimes find themselves taken by surprise by various carefully crafted arguments that creationists have devised, and so it is really useful for everyone to see exactly what the most commonly dredged-up creatinist arguments are.  Since many of these creationist arguments are based on incorrect or out of context information, one really needs to know about them in advance in order to be able to adequately respond to them.  <br />So, this book is extremely useful for anyone concerned about the idea of special interest groups trying to force their religious agenda onto the public education system, and I therefore recommend it not just to scientists, but to everyone!	2003-07-31

But it isn't just a matter of nitpicking exceptions, instead, Gould shows how the expanded view of evolutionary theory could solve the oldest question of them all: how does macroevolution occur.  Gould ties together a number of different themes, including (of course) punctuated equilibrium and the roles of structural constraints in shaping evolution.  He manages to integrate classical paleontological approaches with recent advances in evo-devo, one of the only books that does this as far as I can tell.  Definately necessary reading for anyone interested in evolution.<br />However, the book is extremely long, and it didn't have to be.  For one thing, the first introductory chapter is really rambling and kind of pointless, with lots of incredibly abstract ideas about the nature of theories in general, etc.  I almost stopped reading it early on, thinking &quot;this is a just bunch of philosophy B.S., not real science&quot; but I kept going and I'm glad I did.  Once you get past the introduction, and get to the meat of the book, its much much better.  Although I have to say, the whole book could have benefited from a little selective cutting.  I'm sure we're all very impressed that Gould knows how to use phrases like &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; and &quot;sensu latu&quot; but for those of us who don't go around speaking dead languages, this is just a silly distraction.  But on the other hand Gould's style of writing is interesting to read and a little bit different, so even if it is extra verbose and confusing, the effect is artistic, like a Pynchon novel, and once one gets used to it, it's quite enjoyable.  Another reason the book is so long is a huge section on history of evolutionary theory, similar to the historical part of &quot;ontogeny and phylogeny&quot;, but in both cases there is a point to the history, it isn'tjust for the sake of history, but for the sake of understanding the modern debate, that these old debates are discussed.  Do not skip this part!<br />I absolutely recommend this book to anyone with a basic background in biology.  It would help to read it in conjunction with one or more books on evo-devo.  Ontogeny and Phylogeny is also required reading before you start this book.  Also, one needs a big block of time.  It is dense enough that it has to be read fairly continuously, if one were to read a little, then put it down for a while, it would be easy to lose the thread of the discussion.	2002-08-05

It tells you how to do the basic procedures in a straightforward cookbook way, without alot of theoretical background.  Old-school purists may object to this, but just as you don't need to understand Fourier optics to use a microscope, you really don't need to understand how Laemmli gels work in order to be able to use them to resolve proteins.  This book just tells you how to do what you need to do, and for that purpose its really perfect.  Using this book, you can singlehandedly do each technique without needing to ask anyone or read anything else, it is entirely self-contained.  There aren't too many methods books that can compare with this one in terms of ease of use.  I have used this book and its earlier edition for years and I highly recommend it to everyone who is starting to work with proteins.	2002-02-21

Most biophsics books seem to get hung up on single molecules, but this one stands out by moving beyond the simplest building blocks and discussing higher order structures, self assembly, and cell motility.  The book is highly accessible and does not demand advanced prior knowledge of physics or math.	2002-02-21

This was used as the text in an undergrad class I took on protein crystallography and it was perfect for that purpose.  The main drawback of this book is that it is really concentrated on small molecule structure determination, and doesn't address the problems or specific techniques used for large protein structures.  So probably the best way to use this book would be in conjuction with a more protein-specific book.  But for the raw fundamentals of symmetry and diffraction, I don't think you can beat stout &amp; jensen.	2002-02-20

While it doesn't reallly go into modern developments, its certainly a great way to get started thinking about mass spectroscopy in general.  Probably most useful for an undergras course in spectroscopy, which is where I first came across it.  The nice thing is it has lots of exercises for the reader that are actually alot of fun.  Does not, unfortunately, address protein identification and sequencing by mass spec at al, so while I recommend this book as a starting point, a biologically oriented reader would best use this book in conjunction with a more protein-specific reference.	2002-02-20

It provides a really amazing view of what it was like to do science in those days, in particular about the various political maneuvering that was required to navigate the old spanish academic system.  It also provides interesting insight into the personality of one of the greatest pioneers of cell biology.  Unfortunately, part of his personality involves telling us all how great he was, so sometimes I found the book a little tiresome to read.  I was also kind of disappointed in that it took a long time before he got around to covering the time when he actually made his important contributions to science.  Still, for anyone interested in cell or neurobiology, or in the history of science, I would recommend this book fairly strongly as something they will enjoy.	2002-02-20

This book covers a wide range of methodologies that can be used to study cilia and flagella.  Like other books in this series, it is primarily a methods book and so any actual information about how cilia work or are assembled is only incidental.  So if someone wanted to start working in this field, this book wouldn't be enough.  However, for someone actually working on cilia or flagella, this book comes in very handy.  It is written and edited by essentially all the major leaders in the field, and every chapter is interesting and clearly written.	2002-02-20

It isn't exactly a how-to manual, more an overview of how the whole process works.  Thus, it is useful not only to someone who wants to learn how to do this, but also to those who might be interested in deciding if this technique would be useful to them.  And actually, the whole topic is sufficiently cool that I would recommend the book even to people who know they will never use this technique, just because its fun to read about it.  The book is clearly written and doesn't assume alot of prior knowledge.  A basic undergrad education in math would be enough to handle the equations.	2002-02-20

It is not really a general introduction to molecular biology or to computer science, and to make best use of this book a reader probably needs some prior exposure to both.  But, for someone who has had a basic course in say genetics, and a basic programming course that covers simple data structures and algorithms etc., this volume provides all they will need to understand what is really happening when they run a BLAST search, for instance.  A serious computer-science type person will probably not find the alogorithms described here very interesting, because they aren't meant to be elegant or interesting, just useful.  I think a reader would have to have some direct interest in bioinformatics per se in order to enjoy this book.  One thing that I find particularly nice is that the length of the chapters is just right so that you can read through a chapter in a single sitting, and because the chapters are largely independent of one another, its a handy book to have around and pick up when one has a little spare time.  I recommend it very strongly.	2002-02-20

It is written so that anyone who has taken some basic undergrad courses in biology should be able to pick it up and start learning.  Because it is more of an introduction than an in-depth review of the entire field, it is mostly useful for getting a general idea of what is known and not known in cell biology, without going into excessive detail.  The book is well written and fun to read, with tons of illustrations.	2002-02-19

This book fills this need remarkably well.  What impresses me most about this volume is its wide scope.  While it has a long and detailed (and very well written by the way) section on polarized growth and budding in yeast, it does not simply ignore the other cell biological systems that have been used to study cell polarity.  The quality of the chapters is uniformly excellent, and I recommend this book most highly to anyone interested in the subject.  The level of the writing would be appropriate for graduate students or even advanced undergrads, but it is certainly interesting and useful for postocs like me.	2002-02-19

Lawrence has managed to take the long history and complex details of genetic studies on drosophila development, and synthesize it all into an accessible summary that anyone can understand.  This is by far the most concise and straightforward summary of fly development, and should be considered a must-read for anyone who cares about developmental biology.  OK, full-time fly people will probably find it mostly too basic, but for the rest of us it's just right.  Sidebars on the different techniques provide useful details for those who care without interrupting the flow of the prose.  Defiantely recommended.  Plus, the cover picture is really cool.	2002-02-19

One strength of this book is that it is stand-along, you don't need to know anything about developmental biology to be able to read it.  Anyone with a general knowledge of genetics and molecular biology will have no problem.  Another great strength is the writing, it is not only clear but also somehow easy and enjoyable to read, it's the kind of book you can read even if you are tired from a hard day in the lab.  The only real flaw in this book is that by now its getting a bit dated, the last edition came out in 1992, which is why I only give it four stars.  Of course, the fundamentals haven't changed, so its still an excellent way to learn about the genetic approach to studying development, but it should not be viewed as necessarily the state of the art in terms of what is known.  I think we're all looking forward to the next edition!	2002-02-19

Nowadays nobody can ignore the cell cycle since everything in biology either feeds into the cell cycle, is controlled by the cell cycle, or, in most cases, both.  Because the cell cycle is so important, there has been a flood of information about its molecular components, but what this book does is take all that information and place it in context by laying out the overall computational logic of cell cycle control.  So, although the book does a great job summarizing the extant data at the time of its writing (which is now a little bit out of date unfortunately), its real value is in providing the conceptual hooks onto which the data can be hung.  In this regard, it is still just as effective as it was when it first came out in print, and it is still highly recommended for anyone interested in this subject.	2002-02-19

One  of the most important trends in cell biology in recent years is the study of mechanics at a single molecule level.  Since most of the really interesting processes in cell biology, such as division and motility, ultimately are carried out by molecules that convert energy into motion, the question of how these molecules actually move has very broad implications and impinged on everyone.  However, in order to understand this, one has to understand some basic physics which of course involves some math.  The biologist who is interested in this subject thus has two, and only two options.  one is to bury one's head in the sand and say its just too hard to understand, and the other is to read Joe Howard's book.  Although the mathematical content is readily apparent, only the basics are needed to get started.  The author has thoughtfully compiled detailed derivations at the end in an appendix, so that one can see the details without becoming enmired in them on first reading.  Considering the potential difficulties of taking a &quot;hard science&quot; approach to cell biology, the book is remarkably easy to read, which is a tribute to the thought the author has put into presenting the subject in the most logical possible way.  <BR>In addition to being an excellent entry point for biologists into this subject, this book would also be an excellent resource for engineers who become interested in cell biology (like myself) because it presents many of the current research frontiers in cell biology from an essentially engineering perspective and using quantitative reasoning.  Again, the author has taken great pains to present the subject in a logical way that does not require much prior knowledge about biology on the part of the reader.  Thus, either for biologists who want to learn about the quantitative/physical approach to cell biology, and for engineers or physicists who want to learn how they can apply their type of thinking to problems of cell biology, this book is highly recommended.	2002-02-19

It is really the first credible attempt to start taking a quantitative approach to biology, and despite the developments of the past century (molecular biology, etc), the problems raised in this book are just as pressing as they were when thompson wrote it.  Anyone working in cell biology nowadays will immediately see applications of the ideas in this book, for example to organelle morphogenesis.

It is specifically aimed at educating people in the basic facts of evolution as well as showing the reader some of the desperate tactics employed by creationists to mask their purely religious beliefs under the guise of creation-science. This was an enjoyable and entertaining book to read, although it was written at a very basic level, this is exactly what is called for.  I only had to criticisms.  First, the more recent &quot;rational design&quot; type creationist arguments are not addressed, which is a problem because this appears to be the most successful strategy that the religious fanatics have yet hit upon.  Second, he gets just a bit carried away with his attack on creationists, and ends up sounding very biased.  I think if he could have toned down the rhetoric, and let the simple facts speak for themselves, it would have made an even stronger case.  Nevertheless, i recomment this book to anyone interested in the subject.	2001-08-20

There are also too many different sides and  none of them are clearly good or evil. Maybe this is supposed to be some  deep philosophical message about the pointlessness of war, but it makes for  a pretty pointless story.  I regret the time I wasted trying to read  through this.  Even more, I regret the time that Harry Turtledove, probably  my favorite author, wasted writing it, time that could have been better  spent writing something interesting and exciting like the WorldWar series!	1999-08-08

Goes way beyond the usual listing of features often found in comparative zoology type books, and pulls out underlying themes. Moreover, it is written in a way that makes for relaxing reading. Even the obligatory section on \\"why we should care about taxonomy\\" was an interesting read, not the chore that it tends to be in books like this. Excellent illustrations, good enough to make it a coffee-table book, but also has clear explanations and a wealth of information. This book will be a classic.	1999-08-08

For those of us who are not full-time students, but who want to improve our chinese, this is probably the best book, because each chapter is just long enough that one can read through it and work the excercises in a  single sitting.  so even if you have a busy schedule you can fit in a  complete discrete study session.  the cartoons are a little bit hokey  though, everyone dresses like it is still the 70's.	1999-03-31
