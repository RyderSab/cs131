But the book is also infuriatingly inept: it's written in a tired melodramatic style, the characters are unbelievable (especially the love interest, Dominique), and worst of all it is way, way, WAY too long.  This last fault is particularly unfortunate because many of the book's most interesting passages come in the final 200 pages. <br /> <br />Having forced myself to wade through the entire thing, I have a recommendation for future readers.  I suggest that you begin by reading the speech made by the book's hero, Howard Roark, to the jury in a climactic trial scene.  (It takes up about 8 pages in Chapter 18 of Part 4.)  Although the speech is put in Roark's mouth, it's clearly unfiltered Rand, and it lays out her philosophy and the book's point.  The rest of the novel is simply an illustration of that speech.  Once you've read the speech, you can go back and speed through the rest of the book, seeing how Rand envisioned her ideas in practice. <br /> <br />The 2005 Centennial Edition of The Fountainhead contains as an appendix a useful small selection of Rand's notes for the novel (showing, for example, what she saw each character as representing).  A second appendix provides an introduction to Rand's belief system (Objectivism), but Roark's speech covers much of the same ground more entertainingly. <br /> <br />It should also be pointed out that the Centennial Edition is missing lines of text in at least two places (one being the end of Chapter 11 in Part 1).  I guess it's a sign of Rand's repetitiveness that even the copy editors -- folks who are paid to be bored -- stopped paying attention after a while.	2005-02-19

But those who are willing to give him a try will be rewarded by masterful storytelling, resourceful treatment of American themes, a truly sympathetic imagination, and (perhaps most importantly for poetry lovers) constant metrical experimentation.  Unlike, say, Tennyson, who arguably had a better ear, Longfellow was never really satisfied with blank verse and instead played with unusual (for the time) metrical forms.  Many people today forget that Longfellow was a highly educated man -- a professor of comparative literature at Harvard and a speaker of numerous languages -- whose broad reading led him to unusual forms and themes.<br />For those who think of Longfellow as just a schlockmeister, I recommend starting with &quot;The Cross of Snow&quot; (his very private meditation on his second wife's violent death) and &quot;The Slave's Dream.&quot;  For those interested in great stories in verse, try the selections here from &quot;Tales of a Wayside Inn&quot; (yes, it's a darn shame that more was not included) and &quot;Evangeline.&quot;  For those interested in Americana, try &quot;The Building of the Ship&quot; and &quot;The New England Tragedies&quot; (the latter being verse dramas on religious persecution and the witchcraft hysteria in Massachusetts).  And for those interested in formal experimentation, try &quot;My Lost Youth&quot; and &quot;The Saga of King Olaf.&quot;<br />Like all Library of America editions, this is a beautifully printed book, with helpful notes and a chronology of the author's life.  I just wish they had included more!	2004-07-05

In it, scholars Boyer and Nissenbaum take the then-standard Salem witchcraft narrative and subject it to reinterpretation on the basis of patterns and trends they see in the social history of Salem and Salem Village (now Danvers).  Essentially, they argue that the witchcraft accusations and prosecutions were an unconscious (or perhaps conscious) means by which the poorer and more agrarian segment of the Salem Village population got back at the wealthier and more worldly types.<br />As social history of Salem and Danvers in the 17th century, much of the book is fascinating and insightful.  However, as an explanation of the witchcraft crisis, the book is, in my opinion, implausible.  Too often, the authors seem to be reading into the data, finding evidence of discord where little or none exists.  As one example, they interpret the bare negotiating positions of Salem Village and Samuel Parris regarding the hiring of Parris as minister to evidence aggressive overreaching on Parris's part, without any comparison to the agreements typically reached by other towns and ministers.  More importantly, it's simply very hard to believe that, based on the types of disagreements the authors claim to have existed, people would hate their neighbors enough to throw about accusations of capital crimes on a vast scale.<br />Salem Possessed stands today as another in a long line of unsatisfying attempts to make sense of the witchcraft crisis.  Until the publication in 2002 of Mary Beth Norton's In the Devil's Snare (a work I found much more persuasive), Salem Possessed was perhaps the most influential scholarly interpretation of those events.  (For example, its theories formed the basis of the PBS series Three Sovereigns for Sarah.)  In my opinion, Salem Possessed has since been shown to be a wild goose chase.In my opinion, Salem Possessed has since been shown to be a wild goose chase.	2004-07-05

It is hard to imagine that Prof. Norton's narrative and analysis of the Salem witch crisis will be surpassed anytime soon.  This book re-examines an episode in American colonial history that many other historians have tried to tackle.  What makes Norton's book special is the care with which she has combed through the primary sources and the skill with which she sifts the data in arriving at what is, for my money, the best explanation of the Massachusetts tragedy.<br />As Norton points out, the Salem witchcraft episode involved many more people, and was much more intense, than any other such episode in America or England.  Her central explanation for Salem's &quot;uniqueness&quot; is that, in Massachusetts in 1692, there was a fatal concurrence of New Englanders' belief in witchery and the supernatural, renewed war against northern New England settlements by the French and the Wabanaki Indians, and a series of military disasters for Massachusetts (including the wiping out of several villages).  Although, as Norton readily acknowledges, this theory was advanced by other historians in scholarly articles in the 1980s, no one had previously attempted to flesh out the theory fully and examine the entire, sad series of events in light of it.<br />Not only does Norton do a fantastic job as a scholar, but she also is (contrary to what some Amazon reviewers have said) quite a good writer.  I only wish all scholarly works were written with Norton's careful craftsmanship and scorn for pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook.  The book also includes excellent and helpful maps, appendixes, and index.  It should be noted as well that Norton is amazingly generous in her acknowledgements (in her notes and elsewhere) to all the researchers and even graduate students who gave her ideas and data.  She sets a fine example for other historians.<br />I wouldn't think that this book would be beyond the capacity of anyone with a college education.  Some of the other reviews, unfortunately, show that my estimate of the reading public may be too high.  I suppose that, if you just want to be titillated and not have to think too hard, there are other books you should buy.  But, if you really want to understand an important and notorious series of events in American history, then this is the book to read.	2004-06-27

When he wrote it, Lewis set out to go beyond anything his predecessors and competitors had done in terms of shocking the reader.  In that respect, he definitely succeeded -- his book was notorious for over 100 years, and even by today's standards it's an eyebrow-raiser.  Illicit sex, torture, rape, murder, satanism (with one real-live demon, no less) are all here, described in \\"loving\\" detail.  <br />All this sounds more titillating that it really is.  Lewis's style is completely conventional, the characters are two-dimensional, and long stretches are quite dull.  \\"The Monk\\" is worth reading if you have a real interest in classic gothic literature, but otherwise it may be safely by-passed.	2004-06-13

In it, Robert Dunbar tackles the legend of the Jersey Devil -- the supposedly satanic half-man, half-beast that has terrorized residents of southern New Jersey since the 18th century.  Dunbar takes this legend, along with its Pine-Barrens setting, and runs with it.  The story revolves around a widowed young woman, her troubled son, her co-workers in a rural ambulance unit, and her cop boyfriend.  I don't want to give away anything, but I will say that Dunbar's re-working of the old legend is very imaginative and at times truly scary.  For example, he has a scene involving several young couples camping in the Pine Barrens that does a terrific job of playing on fears that anyone who has ever been alone in the woods at night has had.    UPDATE: Don't be frightened away by the handfull of negative reviews posted here.  This book is not hard to follow, but the care with which it is constructed may not be apparent on first reading.

The reality, however, is much less than the promise, especially coming from one of the world's best university presses.  The coverage is not especially broad or deep.  Instead, one finds a moderately full selection of moderately informative entries on the better-known aspects of Harvard.  It's also far from mistake-free (to give one small example, the protagonist in the movie &quot;With Honors&quot; did, contrary to what A to Z says, have a copy of his thesis on his computer, but his computer was fried).<br />All in all, this has the feel of something produced for the tourist trade.

Probably no resource has treated the Garden State so thoroughly since the WPA guide was published about 65 years ago.<br />The downside, unfortunately, is that the contents are disappointing.  Since the book has no index, or even a classified list of &quot;essay&quot; entries, there's no way to locate a topic unless you're able to hit upon the precise title under which it's discussed (assuming it's in there somewhere).  The scope of coverage is quirky: it seems that every hamlet in the state has its own entry, yet there is no general treatment of, for example, industry or commerce or dairying or corporations (all things that are or have been highly important to New Jersey).  Several of the general entries I have read so far are not exactly packed with information; the entries on industrial architecture and law, for instance, are as much about trends that apply to the whole nation as about anything specific to New Jersey.<br />Still, this work is certainly worth having, and Rutgers should be praised for making it possible.

The plot is totally implausible, and none of the characters is developed to any degree.  I felt as if all of the important action (with one major exception about halfway through) happened before the book began or offstage.  In addition, Cornwell seems to have got into the habit of suffusing every scene between two women with erotic tension.  Yet even that theme, if it is one, goes nowhere.<br />Cornwell was either under incredible time pressure when she wrote this or has become sick of her characters.

(A mass tort is a wrong committed against a very large group of people, such as the marketing of a defective product that injures a lot of its users.)  He describes first a fantasy system in which the wrongdoer uses a compliant plaintiffs' attorney to persuade victims to skip the courts and take temptingly large sums of money in exchange for signing releases and confidentiality agreements.  Next Grisham describes something more along the lines of what actually happens today, with the plaintiffs' attorneys uncovering defective (or possibly defective) products, gathering together large classes of plaintiffs (the victims), commencing class-action lawsuits against the wrongdoer, and then negotiating a settlement in which each of the plaintiffs receives a moderate amount while their attorneys take an unseemly, large cut.  Finally, Grisham describes &quot;the old-fashioned way,&quot; with the plaintiff's attorney bringing to trial a lawsuit on behalf of one victim of the mass tort.<br />Each of the approaches is shown to have its downside, and not one is presented as clearly the best.  Grisham's sympathies appear to lie with the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; approach, although the fantasy approach is the one that, in the novel, results in the largest payout to the largest group of victims.  <br />Grisham's presentation of the three hypothetical mass-tort systems is framed in a perfunctory story employing typical Grisham elements.  The protagonist is a young, cocky, underdog lawyer with a taste for leggy blondes and fast cars (a sort of cross between Atticus Finch and your basic frat boy); he has run-ins with stuffed shirts, slick big-firm lawyers, and bureaucrats; he struggles to find love with a &quot;good&quot; girl while alley-catting with a &quot;bad&quot; girl; he is alienated from his somewhat embarrassing father; etc., etc.  The conclusion is mercifully swift, with no effort to tie up the numerous loose ends that the reader doesn't care about anyway.<br />As fiction, this is poor stuff.  As journalism, it may be of interest, giving a painless but spotty introduction to certain aspects of the legal system.  But if that is the kind of information you are after, there are much better books available, such as the works of the scholar Lawrence Friedman.	2003-10-01

Mr. Good starts on the ground floor, so that no previous knowledge of grammar is needed.  At the same time, however, he does not talk down to the reader, nor does he shy away from many aspects of grammar that other books deem too complex for beginners.  Everything is explained here with perfect clarity, and nothing important is left out.  Moreover, beyond Mr. Good's superlative explanations of grammar, this book earns 10 stars because Mr. Good shows us how our knowledge of grammar can improve our writing.  He does this not with airy praise of grammatical education, but with concrete examples and advice that you can start using to improve your writing immediately.  This book is not short, and it's not full of jokes and cartoons.  But, if you really want to learn grammar and to write and speak  better, buy this book now and read it from cover to cover.

The book is written by an opera expert in a light but intelligent style, and it assumes that the reader comes to it with nothing more than a genuine desire to learn and some money to spend on recordings.  After a short intro chapter, Fred Plotkin begins with a 90-page history of opera that even seasoned opera-goers (of which I am one, I suppose) should find instructive.  Plotkin then provides an excellent chapter on opera singers and the nuts-and-bolts of attending an opera.  Almost all of the rest of the book is taken up with in-depth &quot;lessons&quot; on eleven key operas, each chosen to expand the reader's understanding in a certain direction.  Although each of these lessons is designed for you to use while studying a particular recording of each opera, they are highly instructive if you have a recording other than the one Plotkin recommends, or even if you have no recording available at all.  I would recommend this book to any serious beginner.	2003-04-14

Unfortunately, the final product does not do a very good job.

As its title says, this book is The Wall Street Journal's *style* guide and, to a lesser extent, a usage guide.  A style guide is something specific to the book-magazine-newspaper publishing world: a volume that tells the writers and editors for a given publisher how they should handle certain recurring situations.  (&quot;Style&quot; in this context refers to the mechanics of prose composition, not to a writer's individuality of expression.)  Any style guide's main purposes are to promote consistency and to save the time that would otherwise be wasted in continually rethinking issues that the house has already decided.  Whether the guide also promotes &quot;good usage&quot; in the sense of Strunk &amp; White or Fowler is almost irrelevant.  A style guide is thus a series of more or less arbitrary decrees from the boss -- don't use a serial comma, don't put a comma before &quot;Inc.,&quot; capitalize &quot;The&quot; in &quot;The Wall Street Journal,&quot; etc.  It's not the job of the typical style guide to explain why one usage is preferred over another or to give its user choices; rather, its job is to set forth the rules followed by a given publisher.<br />The Wall Street Journal Guide to Business Style and Usage is exactly what its title suggests and a bit more.  It tells you how The Wall Street Journal has answered the questions that, experience has shown, arise when writing about business.  It doesn't debate the wisdom of hyphenating fractions, for example, but simply tells you, &quot;This is how we do it at WSJ.&quot;<br />In addition, it contains helpful definitions of business terms and (much less frequently) of grammatical terms.  But, if you want a business dictionary or grammar book, then this should not be your first choice.  You should buy this book if you write, or edit writing, about business, and you want to know how the world's foremost business publication handles the same problems you face.	2002-07-23

As a classmate (and non-acquaintance) of Jaime Marquart at Harvard Law School, I found this book impossible to put down.  It is essentially an unblinking confession of how Marquart at Harvard, and Robert Byrnes at Stanford, achieved slightly-above-average grades in law school while not attending class, not studying until a day or two before their exams, and spending most of their time (apparently) gambling, drinking, taking drugs, and/or bouncing from woman to woman.  The disturbing but important lessons from this are (1) that it's not worth making an effort to pull ahead of the pack grade-wise at Harvard or Stanford law school; (2) that, if you go to Harvard or Stanford to learn law, rather than to prove something, you shouldn't be worried about being with the pack anyway; and (3) in all areas of life, you can't grind your way to stardom (assuming stardom is what you want).  For law students who do *not* attend Harvard or Stanford (or, I guess, Yale), this book should be approached with extreme caution.  Grades *are* important, and hard work *can* make a big difference, in your likelihood of success if you're getting a degree from any but the top handful of schools.  For more on this, see *Letters from Law School,* by Lawrence Dieker.  (One other point: the URL given in *Brush with the Law* for seeing copies of Byrnes's and Marquart's exams, outlines, etc., appears to be dead.)	2002-07-01

Since the book is only about 250 pages long, the coverage of any given topic is not deep, but the author does touch on the key concepts and explain them at a level appropriate for the literate novice.  The book divides the subject into 5 sections: macroeconomics, microeconomics, international trade and finance, personal finance and investing, and schools of economic thought.  The section on personal finance and investing will, I think, be particularly useful to the average reader, since it ties the broader economic concepts discussed in the rest of the book into the economic questions that most of us face every day.  This section is also the one that struck me as dated, in that it does not mention all the investment information (both good and bad) that is now readily available on the Internet.  However, that's a minor flaw in an otherwise very useful work.  Readers may also want to look at Sowell's *Basic Economics* -- Sowell gives a fuller discussion of microeconomics, but he's also much more tendentious than Buchholz, is not so good on international topics, and does not discuss personal finance or the history of economic theory.	2002-05-28

King's *On Writing* consists of 3 separate books that King himself appears to recognize are not integrated into a unified whole.  First he gives us his condensed life story, focusing on his work as a writer from his childhood through the success of *Carrie.*  Second he outlines what he considers to be the rudiments of good writing and how he goes about creating a story.  Third he describes in detail the recent accident in which, while taking his daily walk on a country road in Maine, he was almost killed by a reckless driver.  Although I have never been a King fan (quite the opposite, in fact), I found this volume to be diverting and surprisingly instructive.  In particular, his explanation of his &quot;situational&quot; technique of building a story (as opposed to the more structured technique of working from a plot outline, which King finds distasteful) was fascinating.  His methods have clearly succeeded for him.  One disappointment in *On Writing* was that, while he states early on that he wants to talk about &quot;the language,&quot; he actually says little about his use of language, aside from advice about cutting fluff that can be found in any number of writing manuals.  I wish he had delved into the significance (as he sees it) of his voice, combining as it does standard usage with post-60s crudity and a hint of blue-collar defensiveness.	2002-04-23

The problem is that too many people, especially people whose jobs require writing, think that Strunk &amp; White is the alpha and omega of good writing and never bother to learn from better, more thorough, and less dated works.  If you really want to improve your writing, rather than simply salve your conscience, I highly recommend *Style,* by Joseph M. Williams (available in paperback), and *The Reader over Your Shoulder,* by Robert Graves and Alan Hodge (reprinted in 1995 as *The Use and Abuse of the English Language,* yet inexplicably out of print under either title; it's at least as old as Strunk &amp; White but has held up much much better).  If a grammar refresher is what you want, then for my money the best resource is the 60-page section on grammar (including a glossary of grammatical terms) in *Words into Type.*  If you already grasp the basics of grammar and want to deepen your understanding, then Max Morenberg's *Doing Grammar* is an excellent choice.	2002-03-31

I first read this book when it appeared in the early '90s, when the Men's Movement was everywhere (how long ago that seems).  I have come back to the book many, many times for guidance and insight, finding relevance in different portions as I have aged, changed jobs, and faced new challenges.  There is a reason why this book remains in print: it's an intelligent, clear, and well-grounded examination of the primary facets of men's selves and how men can use this understanding to improve their lives.  The authors discuss each of the title's four archetypes in turn, explaining both the positive and negative aspects of each one, and how each can interact with the others.  A particular strength is the authors' ability to describe each archetype in a vivid, three-dimensional (yet concise) way that enables you to *see* the archetype at work in yourself and others.  I would recommend this book especially for readers who may be turned off by self-help works that are either too simplistic or too mystical.  And, as other reviewers have pointed out, much of it would appear to be of interest to women as well as men.	2002-03-10

As everyone in the world must know by now, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; basically tells how various good-hearted fantasy creatures strive to destroy a magic ring that, if acquired by the Enemy, would result in the end of decent society. Here the journey continues just as in the first volume, but Tolkien now moves much more slowly. He introduces us to fewer characters and &quot;wonders&quot; than in the first volume (most interesting, to me, were the Tree Shepherds, the revamped Gollum, and Boromir's brother), while filling many pages with tedious faux Arthurianism involving the Riders of Rohan, and with deadly landscape descriptions that are at once long-winded and vague. Nevertheless, the old excitement returns often enough -- particularly in the last few chapters -- and by the end my desire to find out what happens in the final volume was as fresh as ever.	2002-01-06

Steven Keeva (who is not a lawyer but has spent many years observing and writing about them) here provides an assortment of advice, tips, and real-life examples to help you become a better lawyer and a better person.  While I found much of the book to be old news, every 10 pages or so Keeva says something eye-opening, memorable, and truly instructive.  The chapters on listening and service were, for me, the real pay-off, and I know I will be going back to them frequently.  By contrast, his portrayal of litigators, trials, and especially corporate practice struck me as simplistic and a bit stereotyped.  In addition, those who are unreceptive to the touchy-feely approach to problem-solving should be warned that this book is nothing if not touchy-feely.  That said -- and notwithstanding my other qualifications -- this book is an *important* contribution to the literature of professionalism and lawyers' &quot;mental hygiene&quot; (as Prof. Stone of Harvard has called it).  Since this book is also a quick read, every lawyer and law student who even suspects it may be helpful should give it a try and then keep it close at hand.	2001-12-09

I bought this 3-disk set because, frankly, I couldn't imagine how anyone could pull off a reading of Proust's verbose and complex style.  I was more than pleasantly surprised:  Neville Jason does a fantastic job.  His voice is polished and not overly dramatic; his phrasing shows a real understanding of both Proust's meaning and how best to convey orally his long sentences with all their long interpolations.  The abridgment (which, according to the liner notes, was also done by Mr. Jason) is very sensitive to the original and retained far more of it than I thought was possible in a three-hour set.  Period music is included, briefly and effectively, in the background.  Since &quot;Swann in Love&quot; is more-or-less a self-contained novella within the great Recherche, this audio book would be an excellent way to get one's feet wet with Proust.  My only caveat is that, Proust being, to say the least, a dense writer, this is not the kind of audio book that one can fully comprehend while doing something else.  Just put your feet up and listen.	2001-12-02

In this, the fourth volume of Proust's &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;), the narrator is suddenly exposed to a new level of worldly knowledge, a knowledge that the previous volumes foreshadowed but never openly discussed.  The volume begins at the apex of society, more or less where the previous volume ends (i.e., a reception at one of the fashionable Guermantes).  We are then taken on a somewhat bumpy ride down from that peak, to the lesser salon of the Verdurins (previously seen through Swann's eyes in vol. 1) and the narrator's less-than-admirable conduct toward Albertine.  Along the way, as the narrator becomes more of an actor in, and less of an observer of, the world, Proust's style likewise becomes, at times, more traditionally novelistic.  Yet it retains the unique insight, precision, and vitality that make reading Proust a life-changing experience.	2001-12-02

I bought this short but dense book when I was in my third year of law school (3.5 years ago), and I have found its advice to be extremely useful.  It is aimed at the &quot;typical&quot; associate in the &quot;typical&quot; law firm, meaning one that draws most of its business from the surrounding community.  Nevertheless, much of what the book has to offer will be valuable for any new lawyer in any type of practice (including non-profit and government work).  The author not only gives homely advice (e.g., read the Wall Street Journal every day) but also helps you see the big picture -- long-term relationships with clients, continual self-education, giving back to the community, etc.  He also provides an excellent list of questions you should ask prospective employers (for those who are lucky enough to read this book before they have a job), plus helpful (and ambitious) to-do lists for each year that you are in practice as an associate.  This book will help you succeed in your law firm (if that is your workplace), and, more important, it will make you a better lawyer.	2001-11-23

It is difficult to imagine a better one-volume history of the Vietnam War.  Karnow provides not only a clear narrative of events, but also excellent background on Vietnamese history and culture, US and world politics, and the personalities involved, so that the reader comes away with a deep understanding of both what happened and why it happened (insofar as the &quot;why&quot; is knowable).  Karnow, a correspondent who covered Vietnam during the crucial period, smoothly weaves into the story his own experiences and interviews, without making himself the center of attention.  In addition, he writes much more fluidly than the typical journalist-turned-historian.  The book also contains numerous photos, maps (which could have used more detail), and a helpful chronology and short biographies of key figures.	2001-10-31

If you read the first few pages of this book after seeing all the glowing reviews on Amazon, you may wonder what we are so excited about.  However, you will be rewarded if you persevere.  In an ice-cold literary voice, Perec systematically describes the inhabitants and contents of a Paris apartment building.  His style is at first totally uninvolving, yet somehow, amazingly, his monotonous descriptions come together like the tiles of a mosaic (or, to use Perec's image, the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle) to create a living, exciting picture.  Even if you know nothing about the philosophical and aesthetic theories that gave this book its structure, you will find it enthralling.	2001-10-02

Why post yet another review of a book that already has 300+ Amazon reviews available?  Because too many readers come to *Brave New World* indoctrinated with the idea that it describes a &quot;horrifying&quot; future along the lines of Orwell's *1984.*  But what makes *Brave New World* so memorable is that the future Huxley describes is (when viewed objectively) quite nice.  People live in peace, society is prosperous, everyone is born loving his or her job and status, etc.  Unfortunately, most readers today have already heard so much about the book that they automatically reject the society it depicts.  This knee-jerk reaction never forces you to admit the many good aspects of Huxley's creation and to articulate why such a future is bad (if indeed you conclude that it is bad).  Coming to the book with an open mind will also enable you to see it as a work of art rather than a propaganda piece.	2001-10-02

This ambitious work tells the true story of one family's resistance to the wrong-headed efforts to quarantine victims of Hansen's disease (i.e., leprosy) on the Hawaiian islands.  The narrative itself is surprisingly involving, with three-dimensional characters, beautiful scene painting, and propulsive drama.  Merwin's poetry here takes a roughly anapestic form, somewhat similar in sound to Longfellow's &quot;Evangeline&quot; meter.  (And &quot;The Folding Cliffs&quot; has many other interesting parallels with that 19th-century classic.)  The language is at times too prosy for my taste, and Merwin's aversion to punctuation often gives the tale a breathless quality that fights against the narrative tempo.  Neverthless, this is a great artistic achievement that deserves to be read and (hopefully) imitated.	2001-10-01

This fictionalized version of a law student's second-year experience at Tulane Law School is must reading for law students, anyone considering law school, and lawyers who conduct job interviews of law students.  The story, told in diary and letter form, is a clear, readable, and sobering depiction of the all-too-common fate of students who are neither attending one of the top 2 or 3 law schools nor ranked in the top 10 (not top 10 per cent) of their law-school class.  While the lucky few may have no trouble finding a job, the great majority of law students face rejection after rejection in the effort to find a job practicing law, anywhere, in any specialty, for (almost) any salary.  Dieker provides a reality check for prospective law students, much-needed consolation for law students now seeking jobs, and a reminder for interviewers of what it's like to be on the other side of the table.	2001-10-01

Wilson, an accomplished novelist and biographer, here applies the tools of modern biography and history to one of the central figures in Western religion. Paul, unlike Jesus, has left us some of his own writings. Thoughtful and dense, these give us a window into the mind that to a large extent &quot;created&quot; Christian theology. Reading these letters with a novelist's sensitivity and a historian's knowledge, Wilson draws conclusions about Paul that more traditional scholars would be afraid to make. Wilson fills out his portrait with information drawn from other historians' works and from other early sources, including the Gospels and Acts, helping the reader see how different agendas may have motivated the very human writers of these works.<BR>This is a splendid, thought-provoking book that the &quot;intelligent layperson&quot; will devour. Like Wilson's biography of Jesus, it will be challenging -- perhaps upsetting -- to those with very rigid beliefs, but others should find in it a much-needed examination of a tremendously important individual.	2001-08-29

Even though this memoir was first published almost 25 years ago, it is still the best depiction of what law school is *really* like. When I went to Harvard Law School (starting in 1995, exactly 20 years after Turow), everyone told me &quot;It's not like One-L anymore.&quot; That's only half true -- One-L is overly dramatic, but the basic events and emotions he depicts rang true again and again. Of course, as the other reviews show, some law students are able to blow off the intensity, others (like Turow) become consumed by it, and the rest (like me) swing back and forth between panic and enjoyment. All in all, this is an excellent peek at the law school experience. Just don't use this as your only basis for deciding whether to go to law school and/or to Harvard.	2001-08-24

I bought this book before starting Harvard Law School in 1995 and followed the author's recommended system (more or less) throughout my three years there. Suffice it to say, I graduated cum laude (and just a few tenths of a point below magna -- darn!). The system Deaver specifies in this book (which is fairly ambitious) is excellent for anyone who is detail-oriented and has the discipline to stick with it. After your first semester, you may find that you can ease up on the regimen somewhat, but Deaver's way is the right way to start. My only qualification is that the book doesn't have much on the use of computers, which can make law-school life a whole lot easier (especially a lap-top). But I found Deaver's system easily adaptable. His single best piece of advice: when studying for exams, don't skim your outlines or memorize your outlines, but *read* them again and again to absorb their substance. It works (even for the bar exam)!	2001-08-24

As a lawyer, I did not expect that a book on movie trials, aimed at a popular audience, would have much substance. But I was very pleasantly suprised. The authors, two law professors, do an excellent job of pointing out the numerous errors Hollywood makes when it tries to depict a trial. (Most non-lawyers would be surprised, for example, to learn that *My Cousin Vinny* is much more realistic than *The Verdict.*) The authors' discussions go into real (but not tedious) depth about not only the errors in the way judges, lawyers, etc., behave on film, but also the mistakes scriptwriters make in creating tactics and legal theories for their characters. In addition, the authors helpfully explain what would (most likely) *really* happen in many filmed situations. Because the authors treat each movie at length, this is not an exhaustive filmography. However, all the biggies are here, and the book also contains usefully organized indexes. This would be a great selection for lawyers, film buffs, or anyone who has to serve on a jury.	2001-08-24

A bestseller in its day (the 1950s), this novel is of interest now mainly as a period piece and as the source for the celebrated Otto Preminger film.  &quot;Robert Traver&quot; was the pen name of a former prosecutor and judge who wanted to write a novel that showed what *really* happens in a murder trial.  He more or less succeeded in the accuracy department, but otherwise this novel is a fairly routine potboiler, with a touch of sex and violence, a wrongly slandered maiden whom only the hero appreciates, an alcoholic mentor who helps the hero behind the scenes, a scrappy secretary who never gets paid on time, etc.  <br />Readers looking for a novel about a trial that is both accurate and well written would be better off buying *The Just and the Unjust,* by James Gould Cozzens.  If you choose to read *Anatomy of a Murder* or to see the film, you would also benefit from reading the chapter on the film in *Reel Justice,* which points out some ways in which the story is less than accurate.	2001-08-23

Unlike many writing manuals, this book places emphasis where it is really needed: not on mechanics, but on the large structural tasks that can make or break a project.

I found the second half -- when the authors get beyond the &quot;gee-whiz&quot; phase -- far preferable to the first.  It is in the second half that they finally provide some informative descriptions -- of visits to high-end shops in Boston and New York, and of bidding at two auctions.  <br />However, throughout the book (and much more so in the first half), there runs a strain of naivete that I found, frankly, not credible, especially given the authors' apparent levels of education and their backgrounds as writers.  In the first chapter, for example, one of them describes her (his?) reaction when someone suggested buying a used book as a gift: &quot;'A *used* book?'  Buying a used book sounded worse than buying a paperback.&quot;  Likewise, in Chapter 13, the authors appear to be surprised and incensed that they needed to demonstrate a bona fide scholarly interest before they would be permitted to handle volumes from the rare book collection at the Boston Public Library.  Not only is it hard to believe that people with their credentials would not know this (or take the trouble to investigate in advance), but it is also irresponsible of them to ignore the library's duty to protect the rare and valuable holdings entrusted to it from over-handling by the curious.<br />For those who prefer a higher ratio of useful information to fluff, I would recommend (like another reviewer) Basbanes's *Gentle Madness,* which is also in paperback.  Nonetheless, the Goldstones' book does convey a genuine appreciation for literature and will probably do more good than harm to the complete novice.

If you've read Swann's Way and Within a Budding Grove, then you realize that this achievement is far more exciting than any summary can convey.  Here Proust also develops the narrator's friendships with Saint-Loup and Albertine, presents us with one of the most beautifully written death scenes in Western literature, dissects the salon culture, and introduces an unforgettable ...mentor.  This may sound irrelevant to life in the 2000s, but, as always, Proust's artistry captures the timeless human reality running through the daily details.	2001-08-12

I thus came to the book with almost no preconceptions.  It was, without exaggerration, one of the best reading experiences I have ever had.  Proust is unlike any other novelist, somehow looking at life with both incredible analytical detachment and, at the same time, a neurotic coloring that is all his own.  But, to fully appreciate this work, you have to take it at the right time.  That time, for me at least, is middle age, when you begin to accept your own neuroses, when your own life consists of 50% memories, and when you can appreciate the relentless dissecting of the immortal &quot;types&quot; who inhabit every society.  I have gone on to read the next two novels in Proust's series and now have to force myself not to consume the remainder too hastily.  Even if Proust turns you off the first time around, wait ten years and try again.	2001-08-10

His style is clean and understated; his plotting is as always complex yet tight; his observations of people are dead-on.  But what, in my opinion, really puts this novel above Cozzens's other works is its portrayal of the &quot;life&quot; of a modern complex organization (in this case, the U.S. Army during WWII).  American society's transformation from an individualistic focus to an organizational one, which reached completion during FDR's presidency, is one of the most significant developments during the past century and a quarter.  Yet almost no novelist has attempted to deal with this transformation artistically, and certainly none has done it as well as Cozzens does here.  This book's straightforward style conceals its immense importance.	2001-08-10

Le Guin takes you into a different world -- in which, among other others things, sexual identity is far from stable -- and almost imperceptibly has you thinking about gender differences and the role of sex (and the &quot;Other&quot;) in our lives and culture.  At the same time, the story and characters are fully involving, with the book's themes enriching rather than dulling the reader's experience.  The book well deserves the acclaim it has received.	2001-08-10

Even though many, if not most, of the details of practice have changed in the 60-odd years since this was written, the book still gives a wonderfully accurate sense of what it is like to be in trial, think through legal issues, and deal with other lawyers.  (It is hard to believe--but nonetheless true--that the author was not a lawyer.)  In addition, the depiction of a fairly ordinary murder trial is neatly interwoven with the story of how a somewhat arrogant young lawyer takes an important step or two toward maturity.	2001-08-09

Here, as in his other major works, Cozzens focuses on people's jobs -- how we make it through the day, dealing with the unattractive challenges life throws at us.  Admittedly, his outlook on many topics is old-fashioned (something he acknowledged), but he generally appears to be someone honestly trying to look at the world as objectively as he can.  (If one reads his major works in chronological order, it becomes clear how this striving for objectivity enabled him to grow beyond many of the prejudices of his class.)  A priceless view of one aspect of modern American life.	2001-08-09

He is by and large successful in this effort, pitching his discussion to the &quot;intelligent&quot; beginner.  By the end of the book, you have both observed philosophers at work and taken a crack at philosophy yourself.	2001-08-06

More importantly, it is also factually absurd.  The plot seems to be based on a high-school-level concept of how Wall Street works (or &quot;worked,&quot; since the book was written in the mid 1980s).  If you do decide to read this, keep in mind that the plot is pure fantasy.  Since Mr. Patterson has so many admirers today, I can only assume that his work has vastly improved since this first came out.	2001-08-01

A great choice for lay readers (especially those considering law school or those who are not inclined to read more scholarly works such as Coquillette's Anglo-American Legal Heritage or Friedman's History of American Law).  A few quibbles -- the chapter on binding precedent is unnecessarily confusing, the headquotes seem to have been pulled in haste from Bartlett's, the discussion of the Civil War amendments is oddly roundabout, and some of the history is contradicted (in minor ways) by the latest research.  However, at its best, the book conveys the grandeur of the law and its slow development over many centuries.  Also recommended as beach reading for lawyers.	2001-07-26

Here, only two of the essays stand out as particularly instructive -- David Wilkins's on whether a lawyer should subordinate his or her identity to (certain) professional ideals, and Koniak &amp; Cohan's on counterproductive incentives built into the class-action system.  Several other essays contain an interesting idea or two, but most often they are too impressionistic, and their recommendations too general, to be of any real use.<br />I also must mention one odd thing about this book: it almost appears that someone involved in its production bore a grudge against Wilkins, because his name is misspelled in the table of contents, his bio is strangely truncated, and there are...many egregious typos in his essay...	2001-07-18
