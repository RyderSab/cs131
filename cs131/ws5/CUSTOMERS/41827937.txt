There are some recipes, but the book is more about understanding the whole process.  The layout is nice- lots of color illustrations.  It is like taking a cooking class but more fun and a lot cheaper.  Topics covered include: searing, grilling, frying and braising. A thoroughly entertaining read for anyone who loves to cook.	2005-08-22

I have only tried a few of the recipes, and they have turned out with mixed results.  Some of the recipes just don't sound appetizing, and most of them take a long time to prepare and cook.  The layout of the book looks like a handwritten journal which looks very amateurish and makes it more difficult to read in my opinion.  Try a book by Peter Bearden or Deborah Madison instead.	2005-08-22

The beginning of the book has lots of basic information about various tools and workshop layouts.  There are plenty of photographs of the tools and diagrams of workshop layouts.  Helpful for a beginner.  There are lots of photographs of finished jewelry and processes throughout the rest of the book. Several projects are demonstrated as well.  I found these to require many expensive tools that the beginner would not have.  Likewise, the instructions would make sense for someone with experience, but if you have not done the technique before, the author frequently does not give enough information for you to correctly do it on your own.  I am not sure if this book is written for the beginner or intermediate jewelry maker.  Instead, I recommend Tim McCreight's books which are very similar, but easier to follow.	2005-08-15

However, I just can't stand the deckeled edges of the book.  Sure- it gives a quaint, rustic appeal to the book, but it makes flipping through the pages impossible.  The lack of photos and the layout of the pages takes away from an otherwise great cookbook.  If it were redesigned, I'd buy another copy in a heartbeat.	2005-07-11

The recipes include common vegetarian favorites as well as more creative dishes.  We have tried several recipes from this book, and they have all been good.  That being said, several of the recipes are very time consuming or involve steps that could be eliminated.  For example, a couple of recipes call for various veggies to be sauteed separately, then combined.  I'm sure there's a good reason for that, but I just don't have a lot of time to prepare dinner each evening. With some of the recipes, I have cut corners or made substitutions to save time and the results have been good.  Also, the book is lacking in photographs or illustrations, so if a process or dish is new to you, the instructions can be a bit confusing.  This cookbook is not for the beginning vegetarian cook, but does provide some inspiration for someone more experienced.	2005-07-08

The first chapter gives a good introduction to PMC, tools, a brief overview of techniques, firing and finishing the piece.  All essential information for a PMC novice, but if you have any experience with PMC you would already know this information.  This is followed by projects with specific instructions.  The instructions would be very clear for someone who has experience working with PMC, but I'm not sure how clear they would be to a beginner.  Most of the examples of the projects are not very attractive, but the author shows an interesting combo of techniques including fused glass and enamel with PMC. An experienced PMC artist would probably not do the projects as shown, but could get good ideas about incorporating the featured techniques into their own work. There are lots of beautiful photos by various artists for inspiration (without instructions)- and they show the wide variety of looks that can be achieved with PMC.  It would have been nice to have fewer specific projects and more information about how and why the different techniques work with PMC.	2005-06-20

While I wish he would have spend more time explaining life before the Permian extinction and the theories of that catastrophe, most of the book was dedicated to his quest for the answers.  He focuses on the laborious excavations in South Africa, tensions between various scientists, professional jealousy and the political climate and changes in South Africa.  After reading this, you will have a good idea about the extensive research that field scientists do and the various dangers they face, including bandits, weather, difficult terrain and inadequate rental cars.	2005-06-20

Books	4	8	8	N	N	A Good Resource	This book is a good resource for parents who want to know how to lovingly discipline their child.  Sal Severe explains developmental characteristics of the preschool child and how this affects their behavior.  Developmental factors include language acquisition, temperament, self esteem and motivation.  He also explains how parents can prevent misbehavior by understanding these characteristics, and when the child does misbehave, how to correct the behavior.  His suggestions include consistency, role modeling, redirection and time out.  One thing that I do like about this book is that he repeatedly says that discipline is a teaching process- we want to teach our children to do better.  I also like that he provides specific examples of problems and solutions.  He tends to repeat key points in almost every chapter, so if you are reading the entire book, it seems a bit much. But you could also skip to a particularly relevant chapter without missing important information.  Overall, a nice resource to add to your parenting collection.	2005-06-17

Many of the photos are extreme close-ups of the dishes, several of the photos are very blurry.  There are not that many recipes in this book I have wanted to try, but the ones I did were easy to make and turned out well.  In defense of the Coca Cola recipe- here in the south there is a great grilling marinade made from Coke, beer and Dale's seasoning.  However, I have not made her version of this.  The deep fried candy bars don't even sound appetizing.  There are really only about a handful of recipes that I will use from this book, but Nigella's writing style is entertaining enough to keep me fliping through the book.	2005-06-17

The recipes are divided into seasonal dishes that use whatever fresh ingredients are available at that time of year.  All of the recipes we have tried are easy to prepare and delicious.  Some have long lists of ingredients, but those are mostly spices that you would have on hand anyway.  And unlike some vegetarian cookbooks, these recipes are flavorful and healthy.  I've consulted this cookbook many times for dishes to make for company (and our non-vegetarian friends enjoy these meals too!)  But the recipes are so easy that I frequently use them in just everyday cooking. This is definately one of the best vegetarian cookbooks out there today.	2005-06-13

On one end of the spectrum, there are recipes that require that you prepare other recipes first, which would make sense if you are seriously into raw food- you could use leftovers. But for those of us who are new to raw foods, it comes across as a daunting prospect.  On the other end of the spectrum are the recipes for \\"cream cheese\\" which consists of raw avocado- yep, that's it- no other ingredients, and his recipe for \\"butter\\" which is olive oil and salt.

I highly recommend this book to both new teachers entering the workforce, and to those of us who have been around for a while.  With wit and insight, Ron Clark reminds us that if we really want to motivate the students to learn, we have to connect with them, get them to respect us, and excite them.  How do we do this? By modeling the exact behavior we expect, lots of praise and immediate consequences.  Many of the rules are simply good manners, some deal with maintaining order in the classroom. Along with each rule, he includes anecdotes from his own experience- often funny, sometimes poignant. The ideas Mr. Clark puts forth are sound and DO work!

This true crime story is actually divided into two \\"books\\" or chapters: The Crime and Justice.  The first \\"book\\" describes the events leading up to a couple's murder on a secluded tropical island.  Vincent Bugliosi describes in vivid detail the setting and characters.  Photos of the people involved and maps of the island make this an even more riveting read.  I was unable to put it down until I reached the second chapter: Justice.  At this point, I was dying to know how the couple was murdered, what evidence was found, etc.  But in this part of the book, the author describes the events leading up to the trial, his doubts about his clients innocence (even though he swears he just knew that she was innocent) and all of the wrangling he had to do with the judge and DA.  Details of the murders are revealed just a tidbit at a time as they come out in trial.  At this point I quickly began to lose interest.  If you enjoy learning about the prep work that a lawyer must do before trial, and enjoy understanding the thought process during the trial, then this would interest you.

After looking for books that feature ethnic jewelry from around the world, I came across this one.  The drawings are nice, and there is enough detail to get the basic idea of traditional costume and jewelry from many areas of the world, but since they are drawings, and many times the drawing is of a person wearing the jewelry, the fine detail is sorely lacking.  If you are interested in the specific motifs and designs used by a culture, it is nearly impossible to get a good idea from these drawings. The book is divided with the explanations of the drawings in the front of the book, and then drawings on the following pages- so you have to flip back and forth.  There would have been room for the short descriptions below the drawings. Finally, most of the descriptions give an explanation of the use of the jewelry/adornment in its cultural context- which is great, but many times he fails to mention the materials- so when looking at the drawings I wonder \\"is carnelian or is it coral?\\" This would be a good one to check out at your library before considering buying.  That being said, the book is a good basic survey of traditional jewelry and adornment, and it has piqued my interest in learning more.	2005-03-23

As an elementary school art teacher, I refer to this book frequently when I need new ideas.  It covers so many time periods and styles of art.  Each page features a famous artist a small blurb about that artist, and an art activity.  The difficulty of the projects range from easy to more challenging, and the prep time for the lessons range from a few minutes to more involved.  It is easy enough to modify the lessons for different age groups.  The back of the book has several cute art history games. I could even see this book being useful for scout leaders and after school programs.  The only drawback is that there are no color photos of the artist or their work, so a good art history book or other source of color photos is essential.	2005-03-23

Annabel Karmel gives helpful pointers for making and storing homemade baby food.  Many of the toddler recipes are simple to make, and something the whole family will eat.  She also includes cute ideas for children's parties or special holiday snacks/treats.  There is a lovely color border that runs through out the book, but few illustrations of the foods, and no photos.  Measurements for dry ingredients are given in ounces and grams, not by the cup or spoon, so it can be confusing if you don't have a scale- that's why this book gets 4 instead of 5 stars.	2005-03-21

Philippa Gregory has taken a well known story- about Henry VIII and his second wife Anne Boleyn- and created an enthralling read.  The story of the seduction of Henry VIII by Anne Boleyn is told through the eyes of her younger sister, who also has 2 children with the king.  Both sisters are pressured into pursuing the king by their family which is hungry for power.  The narration delves into the motives and mindset of the main characters.  This may be history, but it reads like a world class novel!	2005-03-02

The title is an example of this.  The law actually states that the fire hydrant should not be blocked by anything- so yes, it would be illegal to tie the alligator to the fire hydrant.  But is that really a dumb law?  Each page features one law and the authors comments.  Not much substance to this book.	2005-03-01

If you are into &quot;attachment parenting&quot;, don't bother even reading this book.  You would find nothing useful in this book.  However, if you do not want your children sleeping in your bed or waking up all night, then this book has some strategies that work.  We took only what we felt applied to our family from this book, and our breastfed son was sleeping through the night at two months.  He is now eight months old, sleeping through the night and does not cry when put down for bedtime or naptime.  He is well loved, healthy and happy.  What helped us most was establishing a routine and making sure he took a full meal at feedings instead of snacking.  Contrary to what some reviewers have said, I did not find anything dangerous, abusive or neglectful recommended in this book, but if you can't stand to ever hear your child cry, then this book is not for you. Likewise, if you plan to share a family bed or practice attachment parenting and feeding on demand, then you would be wasting your money and time on this book.  Just as with any book of parenting advice- you know what works best for your child.	2003-12-16

Easy to follow directions in the front section of the book are for the true beginner with little or no experience working with wire, and cover only the basics.  The photos of the work in the back of the book are truly inspiring, creative pieces- too advanced for the beginner to tackle, but a great resource for ideas for the experienced wire artist.  It would have been great to have more advanced technical advice for those of us already working in wire.	2003-12-16

Almost all of the recipes we have made are wonderful- the squash and tomatillo soup, the Indian curried potato wrap, the mushroom pecan burgers- all are great and easy to prepare.  Many of the recipes draw from world cuisine, some even combine ingredients from several cultures.  Sure, some of the combinations sound strange, but they manage to come out wonderfully.   This book is full of creative main and side dishes.	2003-12-16

But I stuck with it and listened to them before bedtime, and they really grew on me.  I found them to be so relaxing, especially with all the worries that come with pregnancy.  Her words are reassuring and the background music is divine.  By the end of my pregnancy, just a few minutes of the tape would have me melting into the bed.  I'll be using the tapes with the next baby!	2003-12-16

This collection has quite a variety of subject and spans many years.  Truly exquisite environmentally friendly nature art.  This is a great coffee table book that gets fought over by our artistic and non-artistic friends alike.	2003-12-16

My husband and I read this book, among others, as part of a Bradley natural childbirth class.  I have to agree with previous reviews that I found the information to be dated- particularly the hospital horrors he describes are simply no longer existant in our community.  And his take on painless childbirth didn't work for us.  I did go completely natural, it did hurt, but I don't regret it and will do the same for the next one.  I was a little put off by the way he makes it sounds like he invented the idea of drug-free childbirth.  There are other books that I felt better informed me of what to expect and what choices I would need to make- &quot;The Birth Partner&quot;, &quot;Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way&quot;, &quot;Active Birth : The New Approach to Giving Birth Naturally&quot;, or &quot;Good Birth, Safe Birth&quot;.  Good luck to all of you wanting to go natural- it's a beautiful experience!	2003-12-16

Although this is written for birth attendants instead of expectant mothers, I found unbiased information about all aspects of childbirth- potential problems with many possible solutions, procedures and risks.  It gave me the information I needed to choose what kind of birth experience I desired for my child and made me aware of options that I was not aware of.  Highly recommended reading for both future mom and her coach/birth attendant.	2003-12-16

The nice suggestions are sweet, and the naughty suggestions are fun without being kinky. Good for coming up with ideas for date night when we're just out of ideas.	2003-12-16

Insightful book on married life	Judith Viorst has articulated some profound insights on married life- why do we choose to get married, why do marriages fail, why do we stay married.  She addresses some of the problems marriages today face- infidelity, &quot;sibling rivalry&quot;, yet the book is a surprisingly uplifting celebration of married life and the value of sticking it out through the tough times.	2003-12-16
