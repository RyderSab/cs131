In particular, it will help those students lacking the ability to &quot;play&quot; with mathematics.  Much of the &quot;insight&quot; that others speak of is first acquired through countless hours of doing routine problems; after all, a complicated problem that requires insight is usually just a combination of routine problems rolled into one.  The people that usually have a beef with this book are the physics and engineering geeks--they think that the problems in this book are dumbed down; and that their brilliant techniques cannot be learned, but are instead acquired at birth, and developed by remaining virgins locked up in their rooms reading Feynman and Dirac.<br />Anyways, this book is meant to help those who lack the ambition to become unemployed high energy physicists.  This book will not only help you survive your first physics course, it well help you perform quite well.	2004-02-22

I saw this book at a local B&amp;N near my home, and I immediately saw how superior it was to Strichartz's.  This book keeps the beginner of analysis in mind, and the proofs of theorems are sharp and to the point.  Plenty of exercises and problems to reinforce the material.  The text includes a nice introduction to point-set topology and metric spaces.  A++	2003-10-20

What &quot;nice guy&quot; refers to are the docile, testosterone lacking whimps that become true friends with a girl and have dillusions that someday she'll see how much love he can offer her; the men that show themselves to be reliable companions in times of emotional crisis--like when a new guy f**** her and leaves her.  In short, to be a &quot;nice guy&quot; is to lack balls when it comes to women.  Of course this is book is a humorous look into the plight of a &quot;nice guy.&quot;  But the truth isn't far from reality.  Women don't want sensitive, neutered men; they want a man who takes command--a man that acts like a man.  Any woman that says otherwise is either a liar, has a chemical imbalance, or is a feminist(a filthy beast indeed).  For those that suffer from nice guy-itis, take this book literally--it'll save you a bunch of grief.	2003-10-11

I understand the author's desire to motivate definitions, but it sacrifices utility in the process.  Indeed, this is absolutely the worst book to have as a reference.  Some of the proofs say something to the effect of :  &quot;... as you can see by the diagram, 'such and such' will happen  QED.&quot;  <br />Strichartz, I think, believes he is some type of mathematical philosopher (as is evident by the title &quot;The Way&quot;), and he speaks to the reader in this way.  I, for one, feel that this style is not well suited for a math textbook.  He tries to awe the reader with the fine points of mathematics, and sacrifices true understanding in the process.  <br />I would recommend this book only as a supplement for someone learning analysis, and nothing more.	2003-10-07

The reader is guided through a personal rebirth.  Each day the authors dispense sage-like wisdom to let you move past your old, dead relationship and discover what love really should be. You will find that there is no need to grieve for several months over a relationship that most likely was unhealthy. You are forced to make steps toward recovery and self-improvement through various exercises(I found the tips on diet and exercise to be the most important for me).  Highly recommended for anyone suffering from heartbreak.	2003-09-03

This book is fantastic as an introduction to the deep theory involved with polynomials.  Covers things such as generating functions, quadratics, complex numbers, Cardan's method for cubics and Ferrari's and Descartes' method for quartics, elementary symmetric polys. in 2, 3, and 'n' variables, some number theory, Rings, Fields, applications of the calculus, a thorough chapter on factoring and zeros of a function, and much more including exercises and some very nice problems.  <BR>   Overall this is an outstanding book(like many of the other books in the Springer-Verlag Problem books series--though a bit pricey).  Highly recommended for anyone interested in extending their knowledge beyond what is required in high school or at the university level.  Students participating in competitions may also find this quite useful.	2001-12-30

This book and her ideas belong in the philosophical scrap heap.  Throughout her book she attacks Kant and how his philosophy is &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;man-hating,&quot; but she never explains how.  Regarding behaviorism, she attacks Skinner personally and never on the evidence of his findings.  She tries to destroy the ideas of the existentialists with simple hand waving generalizations without trying to explain why other philosophies are bad.<br />Objectivist philosophy is anything but philosophy.<BR>If your interested in a real introductory book on philosophy then I'd suggest &quot;Philosophy for Beginners&quot; or Bertrand Russels &quot;The Problems of Philosophy.&quot;<BR>But if you just want to hear irrational attacks on communism and altruism, then you'll like this book.	2001-12-15

This brilliantly crafted story is a fine achievment in literature.  As you have probably read from the other reviews, The Stranger is the story of a man, Mersault, who enjoys only the sensual pleasures of life, if only for brief moments.  He does not love his companion and is totally indifferent to the death of his mother; he doesn't even know when she died.  He commits a crime on the beach and stands trial, but is convicted solely because he is detached from society--he is a stranger.<BR>   I have nothing to add to the plot because many have done so much better than I ever could judging from the reviews I 've read already.  I only have a few comments and suggestions.  <BR>   If you've never read Camus before, then this is the book to start with; it gives you a glimpse into the mind of a brilliant thinker, writer, and artist.  If possible, you should read The Myth of Sisyphus alongside(or even after) The Stranger.  You will have a better feel as to what Camus is all about, though I doubt anyone will ever really understand him.<BR>   The Stranger will have many question the nature of their own existence.  This is how powerful Camus's writing is. Overall, The Stranger is a profoundly beautiful work and it is one of my favorites.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-15

Scott Connelly is a tremendously respected medical doctor, metabolic specialist, personal trainer, and nutritional engineer.  He was the first person to develop the now famous Meal Replacement Powder; it was, of course, Met-Rx.  Met-Rx revolutionized human nutrition, especially for those involved in athletic endeavors.  Its a potent high protein, moderate carb, and low fat super food.  Its design was based on research Dr. Connelly did with 'wasting' patients.  It was designed to give a person a flow of protiens and amino acids for a sustained period of time to prevent catabolism.  It has done its job well, and I've used the product with tremendous success.  <BR>     I was surprised that he did not push the product at all and only mentioned it by name a couple of times in the book, as opposed to another famous supplement &quot;guru&quot; who suggests three servings of his product everyday.  Dr.Connelly knows what he's talking about.  He's helped star athletes and average Joes get the body they've always wanted.  Body Rx offers new insights into human nutrition and how the body handles nutrients.  Dr. Connelly shows why the so called 'fat gene' is not the reason America is getting fatter; it's the processing of foods and the removal of vital fiber.  He shows the relation between fructose intake and increasing belt sizes.  He puts nutrition back where it should be; that is, as the main determinant as to how your body will look--significantly more important than exercise.  This has been known for a long time but other diet experts have pushed aerobics and high-carb diets as the way to lose fat.  Dr. Connelly explains lucidly why they are full of hot air, and why most of these so called experts would never want to be seen by others in a bathing suit.<BR>    The exercise aspect of the program is reasonable but still rigorous.  You work out 4 times a week --the right way!--for about an hour each time.  The workouts are intense, but not to the point where you'll burnout. It is the type of program I used to lose over 50 lbs(my program was actually from the Owner's Manual out of a package of Met-Rx).  The essence of the program is based on Dr. Connelly's extensive knowledge of the human body and nutrition.  It's based on one simple premise:  build muscle and give the bill to fat.  If you follow this program to its end, you will succeed!!!  By the way, you will never, ever, ever, be hungry on this program.  He gives a list of certain foods that you can eat until you are full and satisfied, and he never wants you to eat dull, tasteless meals.  His suggestions are fantastic.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.	2001-09-16

Alot of texts focus on the historical side of philosophy, but this book focuses on great ideas.  I did readings for class but also found myself reading more and more if simply for the sheer enjoyment and mind-blowing proufoundness.

Scattered about are wonderful problems in Geometry, Trig, Algebra and Analysis, Invariants, and Number Theory.  A truly delightful read that will have you working on some problems for hours.  Each section introduces the reader to the concept or technique needed to solve the problems in each section.  The problem sets start off with a few \\"warm-up\\" problems that quickly build up to some that require keen (some brilliant!) insight.

I prefer the lively works of great writers of literature and the beautiful, complex world of mathematics and physics. This is mostly because the history books that I have read have been extremely dry and pretentious.  My feelings towards the subject though have been altered significantly thanks to this wonderful book.  Many claim that this book is biased; unashamedly, this is quite true.  But it is no more biased than the history that is taught in the elementary, jr. high, and high schools throughout the country.  This is necessary; people have not been told the complete truth:  the oppression, the inhumanity, the viciousness involved in making America what it is today.  It's not the truth that hurts, it's finding out you've been lied to for so long.  This book is a gem. Highly Recommended.	2001-07-30

Geometry can be fun and engaging. Unfortunately it has taken a back seat in the high school curriculum.  This is unfortunate considering the beauty that the subject has to offer.  Many topics are covered in this book:  The extended law of cosines, Ptolemy's theorem, transformational geometry, conics, and many, many, many more.

When I read the reviews and the back cover on a web site which explicitly stated:  &quot;Reveals some of [Vakil's] most powerful problem solving strategies,&quot; -- Well, of course I bought it immediately.  Unfortunately most of the things in the book are quite elementary as far as problem solving goes.  It is meant as an exposure for people who haven't seen these things so far(particularly talented jr high /middle school and early high school).  Of course you will find some very interesting facts in here (and the rare mistakes-- Euler's Formula being called DeMoivre's Theorem) and will leave many young students in awe as Mr. Vakil shows off some beautiful mathematics.  It is a good book, but I gave it only 3 stars because I expected much more( much more &quot;powerful&quot; stuff as the backcover said).  If your a very experienced problem solver you will find many of the things in this book trivial(you will find some gems though), but if your a beginner with some talent, then you will love this book.	2001-07-15

While it is true that you should have a couple of seperate references to comprehend fully the mathematics the author uses, I'm sure it's because he assumes a working knowledge on much of the material (contrary to the preface that states that it is a transition from regular high school material---Well, this it is not!).  Many exercises and Olympiad questions covering the material presented in each chapter are given.  Hints and solutions to the exercises(but not Olympiad questions--whose answer you can find on many sites) are given.

It is an immense help in dealing with the frustration of problems that will not yield.  No solutions are given-- only outlines to the solutions(which you should only read part of if you get stuck, as the outlines will easily lead to a solution).

The emotions and thoughts that Antoine has very much mirrored the way I felt about life and existence.  As a few of the reviewers have pointed out, the whole story is depressing and grim.  This is the whole point of the story!!!  Life and existence, as the books name suggests, is nauseating and disgusting.  <br />The writing style of Jean Paul Sartre is nothing less than breath taking.  The anger, the depression, and the fear of existing is captured beautifully in Sartre's writing.  Highly recommended if you want to learn and get a feel of the main ideas of existentialism.<br />By the way, as to the question of &quot;If existence is meaningless, why not just kill yourself?&quot; Well, why do people climb mountains if they are just going to come back down? Some people create their own personal purpose and give meaning to their lives through some medium. So, why not kill myself?  I suppose it's the same reason Bertrand Russel didn't kill himself:  I wish to learn more Mathematics.  <br />Anyways, Albert Camus answers this very question with lucid prose in his book &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus.&quot;	2001-04-29

I have to admit that the book seemed awesome at first, but then I got to parts of the book that kept pushing &quot;God.&quot;  I was surprised at first and took a look at the section relating to the existence of God, and I must admit that I was stunned.  I looked at a few chapters before and after and saw the one sided argument all over the place.  Tom Morris goes as far as accusing the atheist position of being irrational.  He somehow believes that atheism and a happy life cannot go together.  I was severely dissappointed by a lot of his views on atheism--it took away from the great information this book had.  I returned the book the next day; I just couldn't stand his one sidedness.	2001-02-10

I read this book and I can't recommend it highly enough.  I would use this book in conjunction with Barron's &quot;Calculus The Easy Way.&quot;(Barron has some excellent problems); that's the way I did it and I am kicking @ss in my Calculus class.  The whole book is a riot and explains Calculus concepts in an incredibly fun way.  If you want an &quot;A&quot; in Calculus then get this book!	2001-01-27
