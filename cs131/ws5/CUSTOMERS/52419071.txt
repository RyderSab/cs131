Getting to the Good Part got off to a somewhat shaky start-- I didn't particularly care for the first couple of chapters and found the writing to be a bit too colloquial and sophmoric.  However, Ms. Files quickly turned  that around and before I knew it, I was completely enthralled. I can't wait  to read the next installment in the Misty/Reese saga.    In the meantime,  I'll definitely be adding Ms. Files to my &quot;favorite authors&quot;  list!	1999-08-04

Asha Bandele writes beautifully.  I was mesmerized by the poetic flow of her words from the very beginning.  However, I, like one of the other reviewers, believe  that Ms. Bandele was so focused on the poetry that she failed to tell a  complete story.  I kept waiting for the real story to begin.  I was looking  for descriptions of her day-to-day experiences, what she did to cope with  the lonliness, specific details of the beginnings of their relationship,  how they came to fall in love in the first place.  I wanted to truly  understand Asha and what led her to become &quot;The Prisoners Wife&quot;--  but the author never truly let us see her complete self.  While she shared  her painful past, the story seemed as if it had been written by an outside  observer-- not the person who'd actually experienced the pain firsthand.   As beautiful a story as it was, I think the soul of the story was missing.	1999-07-28

Zachary's Wings was such a beautifully written book, that I found myself wondering why Ms. Robotham had waited so long to grace us with her talent.  The story line was incredibly rich and  complex and the characters!--I felt as if Korie and Zach were members of my  own family.   I read quite a bit of fiction-- particularly works by Black  authors.  While I enjoy most of what I read, I find the plots to be  somewhat predictable and formulaic.  What I enjoyed most about Zachary's  Wings is that I had no idea what was coming from one page to the next.   Every time I thought I had the plot figured out, Robotham would take  another unanticipated (and greatly appreciated) turn. I can't recall the  last time Ive enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed Zacharys Wings.  <br />Thank  you!!	1999-07-23

Harris is a talented writer whose works I  enjoy immensely.  However, this one just didn't hold my attention.  Between Basil's anger-filled therapy sessions, Raymond's  confirmation and relationship woes and Yancy's trecherous scheming, I found  myself suffering from drama-overload.   The novel ended on a sappy and  completely implausible note with far too many questions left  unanswered.  When I finally finished Abide With Me, I couldn't help but  feel a bit disappointed.	1999-07-15

However, I must admit that this one was a bit more difficult to follow than her first novel.  I agree with the other reader who said that  Tamara seemed to stumble upon the answer to this mystery, rather than  relying on her detective skills to solve it.   Nonetheless, I enjoyed the  book and cannot wait to see what becomes of Tamara's relationship with  Basil!	1999-04-22

Unfortunately, early on, the storyline changed its course and my interest in it diminished significantly. Prior to the death of her  father, Della (the main character) appeared to be a fairly typical young  black woman growing up in the 60s.  We understood her thoughts, behaviors  and motivations.  After the death of her father, all of that changed.   Suddenly, we had no idea where Della was coming from. Several times I found  myself becoming so frustrated with her ridiculous behavior that i wanted to  put the book down. Why was she constantly letting men (first Gregory, then  Sam, then Ben, and then the cycle repeated itself)control her, why was she  so inferior to other women? why didnt she get her own apartment? why was  she unable to get herself together?  were we to believe that all of that  was related to the death of her father?  if so, the author never made it  clear how his death could have stripped Della of every ounce of  self-sufficiency and self-esteem she had.  I would have liked the book more  had the characters had more depth but aside from being incredibly  irritating, none of them evoked any feelings from the reader.  Despite the  interesting storyline, the characters were one dimensional (what made  Sam/Gregory/Claudia/Ruby/Ebony act as they did? The author never let us  know) and the story was flat. A huge disappointment.	1999-03-22

The cutesy title had led me to believe that it would be yet another title to add to the long list of sub-par &quot;sistah gurl&quot; novels being  churned out by the truckload.  And to be quite honest, I didn't know if I  was ready to plunk down another $12 only to be disappointed once again.   But my curiosity got the best of me and one day, in an airport, I decided  to take a chance.  Im so glad that I did!  Ms. Files is a talented writer  and her skills for telling a captivating, interesting and credible story  are laudable.  I loved the dynamic between Misty and Reesy and could see in  them traits of many people i know, including myself.  I am anxiously  looking forward to reading the sequel!	1999-03-09
US	52419071	R18VVK5C4I7WCS	0385487045	301454791	Wake of the Wind	Books	1	4	8	N	N	a true disappointment	I couldn't wait to read this book.  Family (also by Cooper) is one of, if not the best book I've ever read.  Because the subject matter was similar, I naturally assumed that this book would be just as good, if not better.   Suffice it to say, I was sadly mistaken.  Many reviewers have said that  Cooper's talent is her knack for telling a simple story.  This novel was so  simple, it lacked true substance.  I am very much interested in the  experiences of my slave ancestors and enjoy reading books on the topic  (e.g., Family and Octavia Butler's Kindred) so I can better understand  their struggles and what they had to endure to get me where I am today.   Despite my interest, I could not connect with the characters in Cooper's  book.  I felt nothing for Mor, Lifee and the rest of the  &quot;family&quot;.  Not only was the storyline a bit TOO simplistic but it  seemed a bit weak as well.  Though I may be wrong, some of the language  seemed anachronistic (did we say f*$k at that time?) and the situations a  bit glamorized.  To be fair, I didn't finish reading &quot;Wake&quot; so I  don't know if it improved in the end.  However, if it hadn't grabbed me by  page 190, I don't think it was going to at all.	1999-03-09

Tulchinsky had me laughing out loud!   I loved Nomi (she was like the dyke version of Holden Caulfield)Henry and the rest of the crew.   The author  was inclusive (dom, femme, straight, gay, black, white, Jewish) without  being preachy and informative (i learned so much about AIDS from this book)  without being &quot;heavy.&quot;  She achieved a nice mix of entertainment  and education--not just about AIDS but about the entire &quot;gay  expreience.&quot; <br />I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel-- she HAS to let us  know what happens with Nomi and Julie, Henry and Roger, her mom and Murray  and Albert's new fling. I will definitely be keeping my eye on this author.	1999-02-05

This novel was filled with homophobic rhetoric, gay stereotypes and a plethora of one-dimensional, predictable characters.  The entire time I was reading &quot;Fed up with the Fanny&quot; I found myself wondering where  the author was heading, and whether he was making the story up as he went  along.  It seemed as if each chapter started a new storyline and subplot,  with the end result being a series of disjointed vignettes rather than a  complete and cogent story.  This is one i definitely could have passed on.	1999-01-19

Unfortunately, Tyree didnt seem to know what to do with them.  The result was a flat,  boring and one dimensional story with a weak, naive and frankly, stupid  main character.  I hated Flyy Girl and thought that this book might change  my perceptions of the author and his work.  Unfortunately, it only served  to confirm what I already thought.

Dickey did a fantastic job of transitioning between Jordan and Kimberly and weaving both of their tales together to tell an engaging, original and unpredictable story.  His  &quot;Kimberly&quot; chapters were so realistic that I often found myself  forgetting that they had been written by a man! I applaud Dickey for moving  beyond the stereotypical images of black men (and women) white women and  interracial relationships that we so often see.  This is less a story about  interracial relationships than it is about love in all its different  manifestations.  Kudos to you, Mr. Dickey!  I look forward to the sequel!	1998-11-05

After reading the rest of the reviews, to be quite honest, I'm still not sure.  I liked the book  and found its premise interesting enough.  However, I wasn't  &quot;moved&quot; by it, as the rest of the readers seem to have been.  I  felt that in some, places the vivid descriptions detracted from the story.   Other parts were simply &quot;overwritten&quot;.  One reader wrote that  this was a novel that needs to be read twice in order to be fully  understood.  Perhaps that is the case.  I refuse to believe that my lack of  experience with West Indian culture made it impossible for me to understand  and connect with Waiting in Vain.  In fact, although I had mixed feelings  about the book, for some strange reason, everytime I attempted to give up  on it and start another novel, something called me back to it. But as much  as I tried, I never fully captured what Mr Channer was trying to convey.	1998-11-05

I would have given it more stars but it fell off  toward the end, leaving too many ends untied.  Earlier in the novel, the  reader was led to believe that the Good Reverend was abusing his grandson  but that issue was never fully addressed.  Ava experienced her first  AIDS-related symptom- and then what happened??   What happened with Imani?   Did Aretha get the scholarship?     I enjoyed the story but I felt that  Ava's character could have been fleshed out a bit more-  i knew her story  but i never felt like I truly knew HER and what made her do the things she  did.  I know Pearl's work and I think its fantastic.  This was good, too.   I just think it could have been a little better.	1998-10-22
