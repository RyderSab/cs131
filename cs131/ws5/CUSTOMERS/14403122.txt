(summary by South Texas Library System)<br /><br />I've heard it said that a library director should always have an \\"elevator speech\\" ready, so you don't miss that opportunity with a city commissioner trapped in an elevator with you for 2 minutes. This book expands on that for librarians needing to write or make presentations. After years of writing a library column and giving library talks to Rotary and other civic groups, I recommend that all librarians read a book like this.	2005-09-28

Bay's unease, at the cracks running through her marriage, rings true.  The waterside, flower-bedecked cover led me to expect a pleasant romance, so I was surprised by the mystery, the family trauma, the return of a long-forgotten love.  Well done!<br />The viewpoint shifts from Bay to her daughter Annie, to Tara, to Dan and also the emotionally-fragile Eliza.  The story unfolds through their eyes and at times I wanted it to hurry up a bit.  Mostly though, I savored the development of the characters and the flavor of the Connecticut seaside life.<br />If you like this author, I'd also recommend Wanda Ryder's Free To Go.	2005-09-16

This is not one of her best.  Although the plot is fairly standard for Neels, this time she misses infusing that spark into her heroine.  Lavinia wonders why a rich Dutch doctor wants to marry a rather non-descript girl like herself, and even the hero seems surprised by it.  The reader wonders this also, until finally Radmer comments that she has a gift for serenity.<br /><br />Usually the heroine shows initiative, industriousness, kindness and other qualities that catch the hero's eye even if she lacks glamour and model looks.<br /><br />Worth reading if you are a Betty Neels' fan.	2005-09-16

Some drug use, and plenty of sex...fairly graphic sex.  Many of the characters aren't very likeable and at times I wondered if there was a plot.  Take a peek into the lifestyles of NY models, South Beach's trendy set, and Miami's high society. Somehow it all pulls together at the end and there was a plot afterall.<br /><br />I could have skipped some of the descriptions of her \\"triangle of love\\" and rhapsodies about women's rumps, \\"her butt alone could make slaves of people.\\"<br /><br />The main character are a retired fashion model starting her own agency (Christa Kenwood), a top Hispanic super-model, a wealthy socialite fighting her age, her hunk of a tennis instructor, and a Pulitzer prize winning author.  Set up three overlapping, interlocking love-triangles and then take the rest of the book to sort it out.  To add some extra suspense, the former agency for Christa and the super-model wants revenge for their defection.<br /><br />Maybe fine for taking along to the beach or a trip to Miami for some local color.	2005-09-13

This book covers those and less known edibles like goatsbeard (cook the root like a potato) or honewort (cook the stems like asparagus, put the leaves in a salad).<br /><br />This excellent guide shows a sketch of each plant with its flowers or berries or nuts.  It gives the species, flowering dates, a description, habitat, location in the state, time to collect it, and its uses.<br /><br />Three or four paragraphs supplement that info with the author's own experience using the plant.  In some cases she gives specific amounts such as for making jam from ground cherry.  Other times she is brief such as \\"put the raw early leaves of hollyhock in a tossed salad.\\"<br /><br />Forty-seven plants get full color paintings by the author.  Seventeen plants are listed in a warning section as dangerous or poisonous (wild ginger, pokeweed, etc.).  A few recipes (soup, fritter, wild edible biscuits) are attached at the end.

This kind of trivia fascinates kids, especially boys.  I must admit that as an adult, I found it pretty intriguing too.<br /><br />Did you know that a woodpecker raps its beak against a tree 100 times a minute?  How about 6,000 lightning bolts flicker across the sky each minute (living in Florida, I can believe that one)?<br /><br />This has nature, history, and sociology all reduced to 60 second segments.  Sounds like a good way to get kids curious.<br /><br />To enhance the learning experience, it includes some games and activities that take 60 seconds (like timing the wags of your dog's tail).

The first blonde's story reads like chick lit with extra sex thrown in.  Janey parlays her looks, her 15-minutes-of-fame, and sexual favors to gain a male with a summer house in the Hamptons each year.  It's a peek into the world of NYC's rich and famous and the wannabes, like Janey, and titillating enough to keep one guiltily reading.<br /><br />The other stories feature a columnist disappointed in her husband's status, a socialite overwhelmed by the position she worked so hard to achieve, and a writer sampling London society and British men's sexual ability while researching an article.<br /><br />A thoroughly gossipy glimpse into high-powered big city lives.  Some of the endings wrap up too quickly, solving the blonde's problems rather simplistically with a sudden infusion of cash (or of a man with cash).  Fun reading anyway.	2005-08-15

The author is witty and able to spin an engaging mystery while using satire to expose the greed, shallowness and environmental degradation of Florida by developers.  Here a convention-goer, a retired widow, a chamber of commerce leader, and a beauty queen fall victim to a mysterious terrorist group.  The viewpoints shift skillfully from the individual victims to the terrorists (a rogue columnist, a radical Cuban, a disillusioned black ex-football hero, and a Florida Indian) and to the private eye trying to prevent the final outrage.  The pace is headlong from one murder to the next with plenty of odd happenings to keep the reader entertained.	2005-08-15

It was more work to slog through the legal section where he feuded with the police and his lawyers. His jail time was interesting, as was his family life, but ultimately I began to resent his attitude.<br /><br />The book celebrates his daring robberies of the rich (Armand Hammer, Phyllis Diller) and the remorse at the end of the books seems merely token. He's sorry he got caught, sorry it hurt his family, but his motivation for stealing irked me and detracted from the account. It was mostly the thrill of defeating the security and plotting it out, more than needing the money, that drove him. Fairly candid, somewhat insightful, and certainly readable.

I remember summer days turning up rocks in the creek to find crawdads, and wandering through woods and pastures under the hot Kansas sun.  Because of those experiences and my parent's interest and encouragement, I care about animals, plants and the state of the planet.<br /><br />Are today's children missing all that?  If their exposure to nature is television documentaries and carefully orchestrated trips to a petting zoo, will they bond with nature?  There's no question that electronic gadgets occupy too much of their time and has consequences beyond short attention spans and weight gain.<br /><br />I wish parents would read this book and take steps to unplug their child and provide regular outdoor time both structured and free time.	2005-07-30

The jacket of this beautifully illustrated book claims that it is \\"the definitive guide to choosing and keeping freshwater or marine fish, for aquariums and ponds.\\" In addition to a color photographic rendition of each fish, information is provided about origins, size, diet, water preferences, and temperament. For example, on page 272, we learn that the Shy Hamlet, a six-inch blue, green, and yellow fish native to the Caribbean region, needs \\"nooks and crannies in the aquarium where they can hide.\\" This fish obviously has an appropriate name!  (summary by South Texas Library System)<br /><br />At 400 pages, aquarium enthusiasts get a lot of information.  DK is known for their high quality, colorful books.  You can't go wrong with this one.	2005-07-30

The goal of these programs is to create and maintain in this age group an interest in books and reading that will last a lifetime.\\" (summary by South TX Library System)<br /><br />This fills a need for librarians trying to target this hard-to-reach audience.<br /><br />Why is it important?  Check out these dismal statistics:<br /><br />Boys are generally 1½ year behind girls in reading.<br /><br />Girls at the age of 15 read twice as much as boys.<br /><br />80% of high school dropouts are male.<br /><br />95% of hyperactive elementary students are male.<br /><br />85% of special education students are male.	2005-07-29

The books can stand on its own, with its rich details of intergenerational hurts and healing.  The reader discovers layers of Southern life through the memories of the Ya-Yas, a tightly bonded, priviledged but troublesome group of girls coming of age in the 1940s.<br /><br />The incidents unveiled through the scrapbook (the Divine Secrets) to Siddalee return her to childhood scenes and triggers even deeper revelations about her mother's childhood and even her grandmother's life.  Understanding even dimly some of these funny, sad, scandalous, risque, and life influencing relationships help Saddalee make a decision about her love life and about connecting with her mother.<br /><br />Entertaining, yet thought provoking.	2005-07-28

The author wants fathers to write legacy letters to loved ones giving them a tangible expression of love showing the appreciation a father feels for the children and spouse.  Wouldn't we all love to have something like that from our own parent.<br />I read in the Orlando paper about a church adopting this concept, planning to teach it using Vaughn's curriculum.  I don't think you need a group or to attach it to religion and it doesn't have to be just for fathers.  I need to do this for my parents, my bothers and sisters, and my friends.<br />Here's the question that moves this book: \\"If you died today, what would your children hold in their hands tomorrow that would let them know that they're the treasures of your life?\\"  Let this book help you provide that special letter to your loved ones.	2005-07-28

The instructions are detailed and straight forward, making this a great reference book.  The boxed sections give Smithsonian stories of rescuing artifacts and also \\"Don's Tips\\" to supplement the text.<br /><br />Browsing through this book, you'll find ways to take care of everything precious to you from your vintage comic books to Grandma's quilt to your tattered teddy bear.<br /><br />The book helps you decide which of your items are worth keeping, and how to decide what should be given away or just junked. It gives advice for saving photographs and films and how to save toys. It covers preservation of furniture, fine art, musical instruments, textiles, sports and political memorabilia, and coins and stamps. If it is books, comic books or newspapers you want to save, it gives advice for that as well.<br /><br />I find this topic fascinating and have created my own web page about saving World War II letters.	2005-07-28

Told in rhyme, it's also a counting book from one to ten and then back down: \\"Five vampires on the loose, gave the witch some fresh blood juice.\\"<br /><br />The mummies, scarecrows, ghosts and skeletons contributing to the stew are mostly a jolly sort illustrated in a variety of poses and suitably murky colors.  The tenth grouping of characters (werewolves) disturbed me a little with their oversized heads and sharp teeth.  I deducted one star for this.<br /><br />The story ends with all the characters partying and enjoying their stew.  The pacing and excellent illustrations make this a natural for reading to a group of preschoolers at Halloween.	2005-07-28

The whole story unfolds with poetic descriptions over a period of two nights after the death of his father.<br /><br />Christopher Snow unwittingly sets off a chain reaction when he stumbles upon the switching of his father's body for that of a bludgeoned vagrant. With his faithful dog, Orson, at his side, he seeks answers, flees unknown foes, sees a murder, plays hide and seek with spooky forces in a dark house and across the countryside, uncovers life threatening secrets, fights for his life (and Orson's), etc. Apparently the whole character of mankind is at stake here affecting the future of the US and eventually the world.<br /><br />In between all that, he plays it cool with his surfer buddy, spies on a funeral home, ponders in a graveyard, confronts a priest and romances his girlfriend. Busy guy!<br /><br />The overly detailed description of his every footfall, gleam of moonlight, and blood dripping from a corpse eventually loses its urgency. The reader just can't sustain a life-or-death interest for that long, especially when the main character seems pretty nonchalant about it at times.<br /><br />The revelations late in the book, seem too easily given, when early heroic efforts are made to conceal the information. The ending sets the scene for further mis-adventures in Moonlight Bay, but I won't pursue it further.	2005-07-21

His life is shaped by his Texas heroes, river rafting like Huck Finn, selling newspapers on a Houston street corner, listening to war news on the radio and being confined for months to bed by rheumatic fever.<br /><br />I'm surprised that Rather didn't apply his wordsmithing to this, but worked with a co-writer.  The result is not of the quality of Angela's Ashes; lacking compelling detail and life or death feelings.  Still, it helps define the character building influences of a figure familiar to Americans from their daily TV news.  It also gives a slice-of-life view of an era that feels like an old Saturday Evening Post cover by Norman Rockwell.	2005-07-21

Rule explores the characters' lives and unfolds the crime gradually to the reader.<br /><br />Cauffiel spends a lot of time meandering around following the erratic behavior of a drugged pimp trying to show his background and motivation.  Unfortunately with this account, it jumps rather aimlessly from the psychologist to the hooker to the pimp to the wife and through a misc. batch of police and street people. It ends up being confusing rather than coherently setting the scene and climate for a murder.<br /><br />Even after reading the whole book, it was hard to see why the psychologist so quickly fixated on the young streetwalker, spending thousands of dollars indulging her, to the point of endangering his practice and marriage.<br /><br />I think a little more detail on the victim's childhood, and his parents' behavior would have clarified this.	2005-07-01

Keeley throws herself into decorating an antebellum mansion so she can forget her cheating fiancee.  The story is spiced up with a conniving woman, small town personalities, a factory close to closing down, and a potential romance.<br /><br />I enjoyed following along as she tracks down the furniture for the house, fends off the repentant cad, and ignores the wealthy home/factory owner's charms.  The mystery blended well into the rest of the story but carried an aura of sadness that I'm not used to finding in my chick lit reading.<br /><br />Very readable, with a great southern flavor.	2005-06-23

She has a way with descriptions of places and people that truly starts one to hungering for the sounds and tastes of country life.  A number of recipes are sprinkled throughout the book, so the reader can try first-hand Paolo's Fennel Fritters or Sea Bass in a Salt Crust.<br />Besides the travel, people and food, the book details the restoration of the gardens in the centuries-old villa.

Marta Enos' day is ruined when the wind blows her papers out the window and the dogs chew her homework into trash; then she trips and breaks her glasses. Grandmother comforts Marta Enos, repairs the glasses, bakes her some warm tortillas, and tells her a traditional tale about how to deal with a problem. Sometimes it is good to be a tree and look all ways at once; sometimes it is best to be a rock or a fierce mountain lion; but Marta Enos chooses to be an eagle, who can fly high and see how small the problem is. Strongbow's watercolor  paintings set the story in wide desert landscapes as the sun sets and the full moon rises, and warm portraits show the loving bond across generations.

In less than 200 pages, and small pages at that, Carlson gives easy adjustments for people to make in their lives.  They may seem a bit simplistic at first, but that's what makes them work.  Don't divorce your wife, change your job or make other huge changes, then find out life is still a rat race and you are still unhappy.<br />Some of the changes involve attitudes.  Stop negative thinking.  Pause before making a decision to think, \\"Is this what I've always done or what I really want?\\"  Be kind to yourself.  Recognize your stress triggers.  Start a \\"rainy day\\" fund.  Make a small difference in someone's life everyday.<br />There are 39 of these recommended changes.  It seems to me that instituting even one or two would give immediate relief to someone overworked and stressed out.  Gradually adopting many of these behaviors and ways of thinking could be life altering.<br />Yes, they may seem simplistic, but what do you have to lose?

He is one of America's quintessential troubadours, logging almost 70,000 miles a year on the open road. The Tour is not only a collection of characters, consequences and experiences, it is - perhaps more importantly - an offering up of some of the wisdom gained from \\"a life between the lines.\\"<br /><br />The Tour is a book that will take you on two journeys, one past and one present. Each fall, Bill Staines leaves his home in New England and sets out on a five week tour of North America, playing his music for fans and friends, and covering almost 15,000 miles of open highway. On the twentieth anniversary of the tour, he began writing this narrative.<br /><br />Read these pages and you will journey with Bill and get to know some of the people and places that make his story worth telling.<br /><br />The Tour is also a chronicle of a life, from the time that Bill spent growing up in the Boston-Cambridge folk music scene in the early 1960's to the present, when he has come to be considered one of the most respected singer-songwriters on the folk music scene today.

This title intrigued me after reading about it in Life Magazine.  Ryan is a life coach who says you can teach yourself to look on the brighter side of life.  Sure your life may be complicated and sad things happen, but apparently you can train your brain to be more upbeat.<br />One exercise was to make a list of three good things from each day.  Maybe it's just something small, like \\"I'm glad that I didn't lose my temper when my boss reprimanded me.\\"  Maybe it's focusing on the beauty that is around us, like \\"Seeing the egret fly by was a treat.\\"<br />Eventually this attitude adjustment will become a routine part of our thinking.  Sure can't hurt to try.<br />I signed up for the daily e-mails (happiness boosters) from this author.  They're great and remind you to put into practice what you learned from reading the book.	2005-05-15

The activities do not require hard-to-find or expensive materials, and they are designed for all ages, from preschoolers, to after-schoolers (over six years old), and families.

She shows how to build a grassroots campaign, strengthen the library's connections in the community by forming powerful partnerships, become involved in policy making early, and promote the library's tangible assets. (summary by South TX Library System)<br /><br />Librarians need to work on these partnerships and not just assume everyone in the community values their library.  I personally have seen it pay off, when other agencies call and ask you to be a part of their grant project or want to give your library something.  The connection must be there in the first place or they won't think of the library for this.	2005-05-13

(summary by South Texas Library System)<br /><br />No library is free of these kinds of problems and there's no use trying to solve it single-handed.

Each program opens with a thumbnail overview, followed by combinations of poetry, picture books, chapter book excerpts, and short stories. Audience involvement includes word play, reader's theater, dramatics, writing, music, sports, or crafts. Reid also shows how these programs can be adapted for younger (preschool) or older (fifth and sixth grade) children. (summary by South TX Library System)<br /><br />My Children's Services staff is always on the look out for ideas like these.  Several years ago, they launched a pre-teen/early teen library club for after school.  It really changed the dynamics of our unruly afterschool crowd.  I strongly recommend that libraries work with (instead of against) this age group.	2005-05-13

Weezie's cooking and her boyfriend who's a chef add some mouthwatering descriptions to the southern scenario. The flavors of Savannah blend for a lively murder mystery that's fun and quirky.

This book collects together lots of goofy things people do.  Some of it is compulsive behavior, phobias, or just quirks.  It was fun looking though it to see if any were behaviors I have.<br /><br />I liked the one where the lady puts her hot iron in the refrigerator to avoid any possibility of a fire after finishing her ironing.  You can't help but smile at some of the ideas.  One woman shopped for food that starts with the same letter (carrots, cat food, corn).  Must have made life complicated.<br /><br />The behaviors are grouped so there's a chapter on food, clothing, money, sleep, germs, bathroom, and miscellaneous.	2005-05-09

You get the feeling that she couldn't find enough to build her usually thorough coverage and that's why they are collected together.  Without the other aspects, there is too much description of blood spattered crime scenes and the harrowing last minutes of the victims.<br /><br />All the crimes relate to the theme of love, albeit warped and murderous relationships or situations.  That does pull the vignettes together, but for the most part they are just too skimpy.<br /><br />\\"The Highway Accident\\" was maybe the best developed of the accounts in this collection.  It's an old case that parallels the more recent Mark and Lori Hacking case.<br /><br />The early part of the book puts closure to some old, cold cases through the use of DNA breakthoughs, but still it lacks the drama of her usual police work descriptions.	2005-05-06

I'd recommend starting with his Seven Layers of Decorating book first.  If You Can Dream It builds on that earlier book.<br /><br />This is not just a collection of pretty room photos.  It really makes you think about how decorating relates to your inner feelings and dreams.  He gives the reader a great tool in the Dream Questionnaire, then explains how your answers can be applied to home decorating.<br /><br />His own questionnaire reveals his love for things tropical/water/organic/bamboo, etc.  That explains the dramatic rooms pictured in the book which may be overly theatrical for some people.  The martini lounge and the retro room put me off, but I fell in love with his down-by-the-sea bedroom and some of the others.<br /><br />Sandwiched in are projects (usually 2 pages each).  These include making a circular pouf, a saucer fountain, a bookshelf room divider, an ottoman, modular bookshelves, a nautical bedside table, deco sconces, a bed/storage combo, refacing kitchen cabinets, and finally a car bed for a kid's room.<br /><br />Well, worth a look.	2005-05-06

This cookbook presents recipes appropriate for the different periods in St. Augustine's 500 year time span.  The history for each period is painlessly woven into each section.  It even includes likely recipes (roasted bear, raccoon and venison) from the Timucua Indians.<br /><br />The book quickly moves into the Spanish period with recipes like oyster stew and avocado salad.  Other periods include the British, the Minorcans, return of the Spanish, early American territory, the Gilded Age and finally the present era of restoration.<br /><br />From those different influences the book includes recipes like coconut shrimp, mincemeat cookies, smoked salmon tarts, and key lime pie.  A few recipes are too novel for the average cook of today (alligator tail, wild and spicy hog feet, bull frog legs or bootstrap jerky).  Most recipes are appealing and manageable.<br /><br />This book makes a wonderful souvenir for anyone who visits historic St. Augustine, or a useful book for anyone who likes heritage recipes or any cook looking for diverse recipes.<br /><br />The book is further enhanced by drawings of historic buildings, vintage kitchen utensils and foods.	2005-04-25

The story follows the MacIvey family from 1863 through three generations to the present.  As they scratch out a hardscrabble living, the reader follows their experiences during the Civil War, and through Florida's pioneer days.<br /><br />Immerse yourself in their struggle to build a home, drive cattle to market, start orchards, deal with rustlers, wild animals, life and death in Central Florida.<br /><br />You learn so much about Florida's early landscape and the damage done by settlement, as well as the effect on the Native Americans.  Some of the homespun life reminds me of Rawling's classic, The Yearling.  I highly recommend it, not just for Floridians, but for everyone to know more about their country's development in this unique region.  The story is compelling.	2005-04-25

Over 100 questions are answered in the book.  Most people will find a good number that apply to different situations in their lives.<br /><br />A number of double-page spreads explain basic feng shui tools (mirrors, plants, sounds, patterns/shapes, colors, building materials, dimensions) or principles (eight directions, nine ki astrology, five elements, yin/yang, chi energy).<br /><br />The use of color and layout enhance the appeal of the book.	2005-04-25

Dimmick, an avocational archeologist, discovered an Army site plus artifacts discarded in the mud that had been unknown to history more than 150  years.  He is a medical doctor, a pediatrician with the South Texas Medical Clinics in Wharton, Tex.<br /><br />  Eight years of historical research, in which he learned Spanish to study documents from Mexico, resulted in the Texas State Historical Association in Austin publishing his unique book. \\"Sea of Mud\\" finds the truth of what happened before, during and after the battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836.  The 400-page book, illustrated and with maps, throws fresh light on one of world history's most decisive battles.<br /><br />  Both published and unpublished documents from the defeated army tell what really happened, and why.  Several Spanish documents are printed in English for the first time in Dimmick's book.<br /><br />  The author did his undergraduate work at Texas A&M University and received his M.D. in 1977 from the University of Nebraska Medical School.  Born and raised in Wyoming, he admits he \\"knew next to nothing about Texas history\\" before working eight years on a military classic.	2005-04-22

Almost everyone has some motive or opportunity, so you second-guess, trying to weed out the too obvious.  Still the author pulls a final surprise ending.<br />I look forward to her next novel, but now have to catch up on my sleep after a late night of reading to the very end.

Disaster lurks with the coming stock market crash, Jade's fore knowledge of Duncan's death, and Megan's attempts to cope with modern life.<br /><br />Many questions keep the reader engaged until the very end.	2005-03-31

Catherine achieves in business (flower shop), and in love (somewhat delayed).  The wealthy family that disowned her eventually becomes dependent on her in a reversal of fortunes.<br /><br />Catherine is not very likable as a rebellious teen, but grows on the reader as she develops and takes initiative.  Throughout the book she remains jealous of her family and unable to let go of old baggage despite her successes.<br /><br />The author pens some nice descriptions and builds a credible story.	2005-03-31

In the first pages, it recounts the crime several ways without shedding much further light on it.<br /><br />It looks like the second crime here was how poorly the police handled the evidence.  The third crime was attempting to make a book out of the whole mess.<br /><br />I hate to admit that I couldn't finish it.  After reading many true crime books, I have high expectations from Ann Rule's masterly handling of character development, description of the scene and coverage of the trial.  Henderson's writing fell far short of her standard.	2005-03-31

Here she builds the suspense while detailing the seemingly ordinary lives of a pair of physicians and their children.  Gradually she unveils the fatal flaws running through their lives.<br /><br />You see a high achieving young woman turn poisonous as later her life stalls.  She attacks herself, her husband, and finally her children when she can't have what she wants.<br /><br />The author investigates the early lives, the careers, family interactions, the crime, and finally the trial.  Through it all, the horror unfolds, keeping the reader captivated.	2005-03-30

Books	4	14	17	N	N	An Illustrated Memoir	The cover and cute illustrations might lure a reader looking for humor.  It has some humor, but mostly it's a very personal account of a year in the life of Suzy Becker (author, illustrator, lesbian, AIDS activist, and impatient patient).<br />The energy in the book is often angry, sometimes frustrated, frightened, and lonely as she goes through seizures, brain surgery, and recovery.  Through it all, the author comes to terms with what is important in her life and gradually builds back the structure she craves.  This memoir chronicles that and shows her achievement in overcoming the initial loss of memory, humor, and other abilities.<br />The writing might feel depressing, but the humor in the sketches counterbalances that.  A word of caution: some readers may find the interactions with the author's lover more frank than they would wish.	2005-03-30

Maybe a hardcore collector could keep up with this account.<br />I gave it up after 118 pages.  I love books and was interested in the Australian descriptions, but became discouraged by the disjointedness of the book.	2005-03-15

There she tries reviving a romance from her teen years while following the advice of some gay friends.<br /><br />They recommend using dog training techniques on the boyfriend and Liv has some success with it. The story gets complicated by her girlfriend's romance(s), the start up of a fledgling business, the reappearance of the former fiancee and Liv's own self-doubt.<br /><br />It's well paced and unpredictable. I enjoyed it more than the author's Catching Alice which was set in L.A.	2005-03-15

Gradually I realized he was just the lead into the world of orchids, orchid lovers, Florida lore, Seminole life, swamps, more orchids, and the odd people and places that are Florida.<br /><br />The book isn't a biography, isn't a travelogue, isn't a plant book.  It's easier to say what it isn't than what it is.  It draws you into the world of orchids through the eyes of the author, who is very present in the story.  You slog through mucky swamps with her as she seeks the story behind the elusive ghost orchid.<br /><br />It's an odd assortment of people and places, but somehow it catches your attention and holds it.  As a new resident of Florida, it gave me a better understanding of South Florida and what it means to different segments of society.	2005-03-15
US	14403122	RDBGSQKVCMMCA	0911977015	484529506	Florida's Fabulous Flowers	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Stunning Flower Photos	The large pages, with 2 or 3 photos per page, really show off Florida's lush flowers.  Many of the flowers come from South America or Africa originally and the book tells the origin of each.<br /><br />A description accompanies each photo telling tidbits about the flower.  Example: Night Blooming Jasmine (berries and sap are poisonous), Lantana (is a pest in Hawaii), Pelican Flower (traps insects)...  Unfortunately the information is somewhat random, reducing the book's value as a reference source. You will need to look elsewhere for growing information.<br /><br />It is wonderful for browsing and familiarizing yourself with tropical flowers.  The photos are large and clear and even include the occasional butterfly or frog.	2005-03-15

On those two pages, the drawing goes through 5 to 9 steps detailing how to draw the different textures of the animal using hatching, cross-hatching, line and stippling.  The last sections include drawing flowers (arrowhead, pond lily, etc.), trees (melaleuca, pine tree) and landscapes (sloughs and Everglades).<br /><br />Pluses of the book: directions are clear, each example ends with an outline figure for the reader to practice on, wide variety of animals (songbirds, waterbirds, raptors, reptiles, mammels, even birds' nests).<br /><br />Drawbacks: finished work is somewhat stiff.<br /><br />Overall, it's a useful book to get someone started drawing wildlife.	2005-03-15

I'm impressed that the author promotes informal play.  Children often are overscheduled today or plugged into the TV/gameboy/computer.

The book is much more; an analysis of Boston slums, account of school integration, and an indictment of the failed social systems and courts.<br /><br />Brace yourself for some tough scenes.  The author is rather blase about the fights that were necessary to establish them in the neighborhood.  After awhile, I found it hard to read the litany of mayhem, suicides, broken lives and broken families.  It was hard to keep track of the names and relationships.  The book is very wearing emotionally as one sees the downward spiral of the people living in Southie.<br /><br />The author tries to maintain that family and neighborhood ties outweigh the detrimental effects of drugs, shoplifting, drink, truancy, and other horrors.  It's a sad tale that he tells.	2005-03-13

Perhaps it's the epic nature of their undertaking and the growth they experience in the process. In this account, the house is in Ireland and the restorers are New Yorkers (with Irish roots). Pleasant enough reading, but nothing super-special about it.<br /><br />The book includes tidbits about Broadway celebs, Fire Island and AIDs, and slight peeks into the Irish way of life.<br /><br />Other books on home restoration or home building experiences that might interest you are Under the Tuscan Sun (Italy) or A Family Place (Nova Scotia). One I can't recommend is Turn Left at the Black Cow (Ireland).	2005-03-13
US	14403122	R3N6JR6WVN9UOR	1573222410	933828152	Almost There	Books	4	5	6	N	N	More Irish Memoirs	After reading Are You Somebody?, readers have high expectations of O'Faolain's continued memoirs.  Much of this book focuses on the changes in her life brought by the success of the first book.  She describes the travel, the attention, the money, and the first glimmers of contentment.<br />The six years covered in this book were less inspiring to me than her first one.  I can relate to her struggle to shed the family baggage and find satisfaction in life.  I can empathize with her fears and reconciliation with growing older.  Her descriptions of places and people and her inner thoughts resonate with me.  Still overall it feels more forced, less fluid and ultimately less satisfying than Are You Somebody?.  When her next book is published, I'll want to read it to see how her struggle with life, love and family and loneliness evolves.	2005-03-10

The intertwining lives of the two families through their summers sharing a house in Nantucket becomes the focus of the story.<br /><br />Although the issues of infidelity and a child's serious illness may seem like a TV drama, the writing rises above that.  It involves you in Lucy's thoughts and feelings through the ups and downs of their lives.  A miscarriage, a spouse's depression, and other difficulties are touchingly woven into the story.<br /><br />One glitch in the book is the blurting out of secrets that rends the families apart.  It's hard to imagine, even under stress, that Lucy would make that revelation so baldly and with such poor timing.  The repercussions from that incident reverberate through the final 100 pages of the book.<br /><br />I found the relationships meaningful and certainly will look for more Nancy Thayer' novels to read.  Particularly enjoyable are her descriptions of small town life, of children and of Nantucket.  She also has a very natural way with conversations and a character's thought process.	2005-03-01

I wanted it to be better, but finally settled for the humor and quirky story that it is.  What you get is a pretty ordinary London girl escaping to L.A. with her old school chum running interference for her.  As Alice blunders through Hollywood seeking solace after a lost boyfriend, she encounters and comments on California oddities from the British viewpoint.<br /><br />Her misunderstandings of the west coast way of life is entertaining.  At times, the British slang descriptions or ways of thinking that the average American doesn't recognize hampers the story.<br /><br />Somewhat funny, somewhat romantic, not very realistic, but generally fun to read for chick lit fans.  I'll try more Naylor books, but eagerly await more Kinsella's which I prefer.	2005-03-01
