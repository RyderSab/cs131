There were a number of scenarios that depicted life in the baptist church as I know it today.  I feel that she developed the characters quite well.  Also, the book flowed well.  This book had everything.	2004-11-13

I found it to be a pageturner.  The characters were well defined and the references to Houston were great (I am a native Houstonian).  Although, Tracey was portrayed as a dumb, low self esteem idiot, I believe what Cydney did Hosutowith the Lauren character was great.  Lauren showed a lot of maturity and common sense.  I am anxiously awaiting Cydney's next book.  Keep up the good work.	2004-07-18

It seems as though Calvin is getting his just rewards.  Even though his son is angry that he was cheated out of the &quot;good life&quot; as his younger brother had experienced, he is still able to show Calvin some mercy.  I loved the fact that he was willing to walk away from the street life and try to make a better life for Khalil.  Keep up the good work!	2004-07-18

While this was a good read - it incorporated too much of the first book, God Don't Like Ugly, and not enough new information.  I did like how the author brought Annette and her biracial siblings together.  It was also good to see her reunited with her father. The central theme was Forgiveness, and it was illustrated quite well.	2004-03-28

From the very beginning I honestly felt that Trent was getting it on with his sister in law - the setting was described perfectly, sounds and expressions were totally appropriate.  Mr. Weber has the awesome ability to put you right in the room!  Keep on writing - can't wait until next year.	2004-03-28

After reading Casting The First Stone - I did not think anyone could be so bad - but he is even worse than before!  Kimberla - you did it again!  This man is despicable and has a way of justifying every one of his sinful actions.  He is so bold - has enough nerve to go back and play on the same sisters - Is he bad or what! Unfortunately - he has not learned his lesson yet!	2004-03-28

The storylines were entertaining and well written.  Carl and LaJill's story was heartwarming, Angel's story was a dream come true, and Mr. Joseph's story - oh well! - it has the makings of a Hollywood movie. There was something for everybody in this book.  Carl is doing a great job in bringing these young proteges along.  Kudos to Carl and his Group!!!!!!!!	2003-10-12

I loved the twists and turns.  I found it to be a very fast read - maybe because I just had to know what was going to happen to Darius and his entourage or the need to know whether soul mates really dissipated.

While I appreciated the description of each of their backgrounds, I don't think the characters were fully developed.  I think there were some unrealistic actions, i.e., the early breakup with Anthony - he was way too agreeable, the dealings with Jeff - he was a bum and should have been dumped very early,  the STD was taken a bit too lightly - She was so willing to forgive and go on - not believable.  Over all - I think it was a good starter -	2003-06-03

It offered insight into how so many of our young people are lured into difficult situations with seemingly \\"no possible solutions\\".
