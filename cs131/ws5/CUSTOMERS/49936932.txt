This book is far better then it's sequel.  This book shows the beginning of Riker's  and Troi's relationship and how it began (prepared to be surprised).  The  book focuses on Troi' death and how Riker handles it, over forty years.   Special guest star, the Guardian of Forever.  If you want more details on  Riker's and Troi's relationship, then you must read this book.	2000-06-26

All ten stories were so detailed that they may make you feel like you're right there part of the action.<br />The Captain Israel Daniel Dickenson story is by Diane Carey, is set during the  American Revolution, and is the prescective of his brother-in-law, Adam  Ghent.  Also there is an appearence of General Benedict Arnold, and the  story ends with a letter written by Arnold shortly before his death in  1801.<br />The Captain Osborne B. Hardison story is also by Diane Carey, is  set during WWII.  It involves a friend of the captain's from the past.  In  the introduction Carey provides a key of all the navy abbreviations.  A  nice touch to this story is that the formant of this story is all  dialouge.<br />The Captain Robert April story is by Greg Cox, but initially  Diane Carey was going to do this captain because she has written two  previous April stories (Final Frontier and Best Destiny).  However, Carey  wanted to do the two historical stories more because Gene Roddenberry was  inspired by these two ships.  This story is set in 2246 and has guest  appearences of Kor and Kruge, and sets a background story on the Tarsus IV  incident (The Conscience of the King).<br />The Captain Pike story is by Jerry  Oltion, who has already written a Pike book (Captain's Table book 6, Where  Sea Meets Sky, also a good book), and explores the crew a little more.   Here, Number One is given a name, which was also mentioned in the Captain's  book.  In this story, we see a new race with empathic problems.<br />The James  T. Kirk story is written by Michael Jan Friedman and is focused on a murder  investigation.  I'm not usually a Kirk fan, but some how Friedman wrote  Kirk in a way that I like.  We see here yet another ex-flame of  Kirk's.<br />The Captain Will Decker story is by Diane Duane, and is set prior  the first Star Trek movie.  Duane gets a bit of hand with the details but  the story is good nonetheless.<br />The Captain Spock story is byA.C.  Crispin, the longest standing author of the Star Trek book universe.  The  story is set prior to Wrath of Khan.  Here we developments of the  Spock-Saavik relationship that is explored more in Vulcan's  Heart.<br />Warning to readers!:<br />Don't read the following story if you  intend to read The Captain's Daughter by Peter David, because the story is  given away.  I should know because now the story is blown away for  me.<br />The Captain John Harriman story is by the wonderful Peter David, who  has already written a story partially about him, the Captain's Daughter.   This story focuses on an encounter with a Romulan examiner.<br />The Captain  Rachel Garret story is by Robert Greenberger, who also wrote the  Introduction of this book.  The story is focused on an unexpected first  contact experience.  Here, we are reintroduced to Richard Castillo.<br />The  Captain Jean-Luc Picard story is by John Vornholt, and is set in the  Captain's Table.  Picard tells the story of being on Andorian Homeworld  trying desparately to stop a civil war.<br />If you enjoy the Enterprise  legacy, then this book is a must.	2000-06-19

Also in this book is more on the  situation of Dr. Selar, which, in turn, brings in more light of Calhoun's  past.	2000-06-16

In this  book, Peter David brought in three characters from Next Generation (Cmdr.  Shelby, Dr. Selar, and Lt. Lefler), and there characters from the first  three books of his own of the Starfleet Academy series about Worf (Lts.  McHenry, Soleta, and Keborn) Originally created for this series are Captain  Calhoun, who knows Captain Picard from several encounters, and Lt.  Burygoyne, a hermat (a species who have both male and female reproduction  organs!).<br />These four books focuses on the collapse of the Thallonian  Empire (newly introduced in this series and brings in one more character,  Si Cwan), and the U.S.S. Excalibur is sent to offer any needed help.  On  the way, they run into a whole bunch of trouble involving Calhoun's and Si  Cwan's own past.<br />This series I strongly recommend especially if you're  already a Peter David fan.  For those who don't usually read Star Trek  books, I think you should give this series a chance.	2000-06-16

Actually in my opinion, I think it works better as a recording than as a book.  Once more Leonard Nimoy portrays the ever-so logical Spock, and John De Lancie plays the  omnipotent Q.  Filled with plenty of jokes and riddles as Q attempts  (unsuccesfully) to outsmart Spock, and inadverdantly gets himself  outsmarted by Spock.  For any trekkie, or Nimoy or De Lancie for that  matter, this is a must.	2000-06-14

However, I think that Jerry Oltion could've done a lot better with it.	2000-06-10

Diane Carey is one of my favorite authors and I think she's done well  again.	2000-06-10

With backgrounds setup for Thomas Riker, Chatokay, and Torres, it is definatly a page turner.	2000-06-10

Exalibur and its crew.  There is so much going around in the book, that you'll have the time of your life.  Plus, there's an incredible suprise at  the ending that is concluded in book number eight, Dark Allies.  If you  enjoy the New Frontier series, then this is an absolute must.	2000-06-09

Andrew J. Robinson got into the head of his own character and revealed amazing details of this complex character's history and mind.  And all at the same  time, Andrew brought in backgrounds of so many already established  Cardassian characters from Star Trek.  If your a Garak fan, then this is a  must.	2000-06-09

With many different authors, some Star Trek veterans, and others new to the show (so to speak), this book has amazing details to it.  Almost every story has at  least one familar name in it.  If you like Dax in general, or of its hosts,  then this incredible book is a must.	2000-06-09

Written by two incredible people, John De Lancie (actor who plays Q), and Peter David (who has already written two other Q classic adventures).  If enjoy Q  in any way, then is a must.	2000-06-09

Michael Jan Friedman has outdone himself, again!  I love the ties from the Original Series into the Next Generation. I especially liked finally have heard the  details of how and why Picard suddenly became captain.	2000-05-05

When I first read Sphere, it took me only a day to read.  Every character is so well defined and described.  Being in  Norman's mind an incredible experience in itself alone.	2000-03-13
