Its a very interesting book and I'm glad Neile wrote it.  She married Steve McQueen before he was Steve McQueen movie star.  Neile was actually more successful than Steve when they married.  She was the breadwinner for a while after they married.  No one can accuse her of marrying for money or fame.  After they married, she basically became his supporter and helper to climb that ladder of success and fame.  She did a great job too.  Steve always trusted her judgment, even after they divorced. <br /> <br />Neile takes us from their humble beginnings to the heights of Steve's fame.  She got to enjoy Steve's success for a few years with him before it really started to go to his head and poison their relationship, along with the drugs and women. <br /> <br />Anyone who is interested in the life of Steve McQueen and his career can't ignore this book.  Neile was Steve's first wife and longest marriage (15.5 years together) and the mother of his two children.  She shares so many interesting stories of their times together.  She tells of a cross-country car drive she and Steve made early in their marriage.  Steve wanted her to see the US.  Once they arrived in New York from California, Neile told Steve she finally knew what America looked like - a blur.  Steve loved speed - as in fast cars and motorcycles.  Later he came to love another kind of speed. <br /> <br />There are so many interesting stories about so many interesting people - Frank Sinatra, Yul Brenner, Robert Vaughn, James Garner, Paul Newman.  Also, Natalee Wood, Lee Remick, Faye Dunaway, Jacqueline Bisset, Suzanne Pleshette, all Steve's co-stars at one time or another.  And of course, Ali MacGraw, his co-star in \\"The Getaway\\" who married Steve after his divorce from Neile.  She was not the reason for the divorce and Neile always liked her and still does.  She didn't know his third wife, Barbara Minty, very well, but thought Barbara looked like she could be Ali's daughter. <br /> <br />Neile covers Steve's life all the way to the end when he died of cancer at age 50.  I remember when he died in 1980.  I was 23 and thought he was getting on up there.  Now I realize how many more years he should have had and that he died young. <br />	2005-09-27

The first time I saw it I laughed out loud.  Its a play on the title of that runaway bestseller \\"The Purpose Driven Life.\\"  I expected to like this book and wanted to like it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book like I hoped I would.  I enjoyed the introduction, chapter 1, chapter 2, the part about purses and their role in our lives (very true).  By chapter 3, it was getting on my nerves.  Have you ever been around someone who cracked jokes constantly, alot of bad jokes, who just wouldn't shut up?  Its like they are very witty and funny to begin with, but after awhile - enough already.  That's how this book affected me.  This book is just one joke or one-liner after another.  And some of the things she jokes about are, in my opinion - I hate to say it - just plain stupid. <br /> <br />I couldn't finish reading this book, but I still love the title. <br />	2005-05-21

Books	4	7	12	N	N	They Felt Betrayed	This book was written by three former bodyguards of Elvis Presley who got fired by Elvis in early 1976.  One of them, Red West, had been friends with and took up for Elvis since high school, when Elvis was nothing but a pimply-faced nobody who got picked on.  His cousin, Sonny West, and Dave Hebler are the other contributors to this book.  They told their story to Steve Dunleavy - and that's how this book came into being. <br /> <br />I did not think this book was a total trash Elvis book.  They told the truth as they knew it.  Red West was very hurt and shocked to be fired.  He loved Elvis like a brother and he thought Elvis loved him. <br /> <br />It turns out Elvis loved his drugs more than anybody.  Anyone who tried to talk Elvis into drying out, getting off the stuff, he would get furious and tell them he was going to do what he wanted to do.  These guys hated to see how drugs had changed Elvis's personality. <br /> <br />I can forgive the occasional dig they take at Elvis - digs that seem more spiteful than constructive criticism, because they were still smarting from being fired.  Anyone who has ever been fired can understand how angry it can make you, especially if you got fired by someone you gave half your life to protecting and taking care of - ouch.  That would hurt. <br /> <br />The whole book is interesting, but I especially liked the section on Priscilla and how her affair with Mike Stone started up.  Elvis had no one to blame but himself. <br /> <br />	2005-04-12

Anne Bird's description of her last trip to visit Scott in jail (before San Quentin) was depressing and disturbing.  Her description of Scott in that strange bulky outfit given to prisoners who might be a suicide risk, and how he was telling her everything would be all right once he got to the appeals process, left me with a sinking feeling.  I felt sorry that her long lost half-brother turned out to be a killer.  Anne had loved him so much and felt a bond with him at first.  I felt depressed that such a good-looking, charming young man who should have had the world at his fingers, threw it all away because he felt trapped with a pregnant wife. <br /> <br />The woman who wrote this book is not the plain blonde we would see on TV speaking on behalf of the Petersons.  That girl is married to Scott's older brother.  The author of this book, Anne Bird, is the baby girl Jackie Peterson gave up for adoption back in the 60s.  Anne was raised in a loving home along with 3 other siblings.  She also has a biological brother who Jackie also gave up for adoption.  Jackie and her family came back into Anne's life in 1997. <br /> <br />I found this book fascinating to read, and I read it pretty quickly.  Scott spent alot of time at Anne's home after Laci disappeared and before his arrest.  Its terrible that Scott hanging around, and Anne's initial defense of him, caused such problems in her marriage.  I wish Anne and her husband the very best. <br /> <br />	2005-04-04

When she shot her second husband, Russ Stager, while he slept, there were too many people who suspected her, and who knew Russ had feared what Barbara might do to him. <br /> <br />I also agree with another reviewer that Barbara is evil for how she brain-washed her two young sons against their paternal grandparents.  Not only did she murder their father, she wanted to deprive his parents access to their biological grandchildren.  The fact that the Fords handled it as well as they did shows what truly decent, moral people they were/are. <br /> <br />Barbara was originally given a death sentence - and rightly so.  Later, she was re-sentenced to life by a new jury.  A woman who could plan and commit the murder of two husbands should never see the light of day again.  Because she was given a new sentence of life, she will be eligible for parole. <br />   <br />I wish I could give this book 4.5 stars.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I feel the book got bogged down in one small section after Barbara's arrest, and during her trial for killing her second husband, Russ Stager.  Its the part about Barbara's creative check writing, hot checks, forged checks, etc.  Other than that, I give the book 5 stars. <br />	2005-03-07

She didn't even have an affair with Laci's husband - at least she didn't think she was with a married man.  She thought he was available.  But when she started to get suspicious he might be married, and asked a cop friend to check him out, the cop called her in the wee hours and told her to contact the Modesto Police Department, and the rest is history, and a nightmare for Amber. <br /> <br />I don't know Amber, never met her.  But she did not ask to be thrust into the national spotlight.  She did not get involved with Scott thinking or knowing he was married.  She was looking for Mr. Right, and wound up with Mr. Sociopath wife-and-baby-killer.  I think Amber deserves every penny she makes off this book.  If some psycho jerk forced me into the Hell she was forced into, I would want to squeeze more than money out of him. <br /> <br />I don't think Laci's picture on the front is insulting to Laci or her family.  Everyone knows Amber was not the reason Scott killed Laci.  He didn't want to be a father or a husband anymore.  I think Amber should be given a medal by Laci's friends and family.  She got the guy convicted.  If not for Amber being brave enough to tape their phone calls, and risk being harmed herself, Scott Peterson would have gotten off because of \\"reasonable doubt.\\" <br /> <br />Amber, you ignore the haters, and go cash those checks.  You deserve it!	2005-01-18

I bought this calendar because I think it has better pictures of James Dean than other calendars.  But that is just my opinion. <br /> <br />Each month has a big picture of James Dean, and in smaller letters and numbers, the month preceding and the month after the current month are listed next to the BIG current month.  There is also a smaller picture of James Dean (different from the BIG picture for that month) at the bottom with a quote by James Dean. <br /> <br />I could have put this calendar up in September 2004 because it has the last 4 months of last year in it.  I'm very happy with this calendar.  I've never had a James Dean calendar, but I'll enjoy looking at that gorgeous face and reading his thoughtful quotes this year. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  I bought this calendar for the pictures, but the quotes are a nice touch. <br />	2005-01-17

I heard him do a bit on it, in one of his many routines.  He said if God really exists, then God can kill him, there, on the spot - or something close to that.  In this book, Carlin says he is poking fun at all religions - I've heard him say he is trying to offend ALL religions, Jews, Christians, Muslims, not just one.  In my opinion, Carlin has a real problem with Christians in particular, and God in general.  I've listened to Carlin get more and more cynical over the years.  I don't enjoy his routines as much as I used to. <br /> <br />Notice that the title of this book is not \\"When will God bring the Pork Chops,\\" or \\"When will Moses bring the Pork Chops,\\" or, \\"When will Mohammad bring the Pork Chops, or \\"When will Buddha bring the Pork Chops?\\"  The title is \\"When will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?\\"  And of course, Carlin is supposedly sitting at the \\"Last Supper\\" table. <br /> <br />I picked this book up at the book store and read a few sections here and there - enough to know I didn't find any of it funny, or interesting.  I'm sorry trees had to die to print this. <br /> <br />	2004-10-30

I had heard so much about it, and read reviews here.  Anyone who trashes this book, and says it takes us back to the 1950s, or its only good for comical relief, or written tongue in cheek, or its not to be taken seriously, etc., - they are either involved with a married man (a big No-No in this book) or they have convinced themselves that guys who are worth having won't mind girls calling them for dates, that guys are really complicated, and some guy they want is giving them a hard time and they don't want to hear what this book says. <br /> <br />This is a very no-nonsense book, plain and simple, about how guys really are and how to read them.  Its not hard.  Don't listen to what he says.  Watch what he does.  If what a guy says is different from what he does - believe his actions, not his words.  Its like what Mammy told Scarlett in \\"Gone With The Wind.\\"  \\"What a man says, and what he thinks are two different things.  And I haven't noticed Mr. Ashley asking for to marry you.\\" <br /> <br />Every young girl and single woman should read this book.  Do you want to get married?  Do you want to waste your time dating a guy who only comes back to you when he can't find anything better?  Do you want to date and marry a man who really cares about you, or do you want heartbreak, misery and uncertainty?  Its up to you.  You can rail against this book all you want, but it won't change the fact that it tells the truth. <br /> <br />I just want to add that I read a review here where the girl says just listen to your mother to get the simple advice in this book.  That is what is so sad.  So many girls are not getting good advice from their mothers or fathers.  They are not being led through the mine-field of youth by caring adults, so they wind up as young women without a clue.  This book will give you a \\"clue.\\" <br />	2004-10-27

When people start dying trying to get OUT (like the old Soviet Union), then I will think we have a problem. <br /> <br />Its interesting how Leftists think Christianity is one of our problems.  Since an atheist managed to get prayer taken out of our public schools, we have seen a slow, but steady decline in everything good and decent, and guns and violence replaced prayer in our schools.  Put God back where he belongs, and back where our founders had Him.  Sometimes its not so complicated folks.  Sometimes its so simple it goes over your head. <br /> <br />And I have one question for those who hate this country:  If this country is so evil and so racist, WHY do you stay here?  If we are bad, then you must have an idea of a country that is good.  Go there.  I love my country. <br /> <br />	2004-10-21

I am half-way through reading it, and these veterans have plenty to say about John Kerry.  Veterans normally don't criticize other veterans, so that is reason enough to pay attention to this book.  These guys are veterans! <br /> <br />John O'Neill, co-author of this book is a Democrat who voted for Al Gore in 2000, and said he was ready to support John Edwards if he got the nomination.  When Kerry became the front-runner, everything changed.  He and his fellow veterans wanted this country to know and be reminded what kind of person John Kerry really is. <br /> <br />John O'Neill debated Kerry in 1971 on Dick Cavett.  I watched it on CSPAN a few weeks ago. No one can accuse O'Neill of being a lying Republican.  O'Neill's animosity for Kerry goes back to at least 1971 when he heard Kerry publicly accuse Vietnam soldiers of atrocities before the US Senate in 1971.  Due in part to Kerry's blanket indictment of his fellow \\"brothers,\\" Vietnam veterans were shunned, called baby-killers, and were even spit upon after they came home.  His words and the words of others were used against our POWS. <br /> <br />From reading other reviews I gather that Fox News did a story on Amazon lifting their normal policies on reviews and letting this be a \\"free-for-all.\\"  I remember leaving a one-star review for Michael Moore's movie \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" and a couple days later it was removed.  I wrote another review that was finally left there (I think).  If Amazon is going to consider this book a free-for-all during this election season, they should do it with all political books and movies. <br /> <br />	2004-09-04

Due largely to Kerry's blanket indictment of his fellow veterans, Vietnam veterans were shunned, called baby-killers, and were spit upon after they came home.  Also, his words and the words of others were used against our POWs being held in North Vietnam.  <br />  <br />From reading other reviews here, its obvious that Fox News did a story on how Amazon has declared this book a \\"free-for-all\\" due to the election year.  All I will say is that I left a one-star review a while back for Michael Moore's Bush smearing movie \\"Fahrenheit 9/11,\\" and it got deleted a day or two later.  Why weren't reviews for Michael Moore's movie, during an election year, considered a free-for-all?

I live a couple of hundred miles north of Liberty, but I am in East Texas nonetheless.  A TV movie about Price and Vickie Daniel prompted me to read this book and I found it to be an easy, interesting read. <br /> <br />I'm glad that Vickie Daniel had secret sympathizers who wanted to help her beat the \\"good ole boy\\" system that was firmly behind the prominent Daniel family.  Price, Jr., was obviously a spoiled, abusive jerk who would have been painted as a saint if his sister, father et al had had their way.  Thankfully, Houston big shot attorney Racehorse Haynes was brought in to level the karma. <br /> <br />I'm not saying Price Daniel, Jr. deserved to be shot and killed.  But Vickie Daniel did not deserve to be railroaded if the shooting was truly an accident.  And how stupid was it of the Daniel family to try and get custody of Vickie's kids before she had even been tried for murder?  Maybe the words for that is stupid arrogance. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-17

I wanted to read the whole book before I posted a review. Along the way I have read other reviews, and I know without a doubt that some of these one-star reviewers haven't read this book. One reviewer stated this book is satire, and not very good satire. This book is NOT satirical. The men who wrote this book really did their homework and research, with pages of sources in the back that any of us can look up. <br />  <br /> I agree with a couple other reviewers who have said the title of this book is very misleading as to the contents of the book. I understand why they named it &quot;Michael Moore is a big, fat stupid white man.&quot; It is a combination of Al Franken's early 1990s book title about Rush Limbaugh, and Michael Moore's &quot;Stupid White Men&quot;. There is a bit of humor here and there. At the beginning of the book the authors give us a time line between 1989 through the present of Michael Moore words and actions, and how we can know what will happen by what Moore says. Whatever he says - the opposite will happen. <br />  <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know much about Moore and his background. I didn't, and I learned alot - from his first so-called documentary &quot;Roger and Me,&quot; (GM president Roger Smith) up to his latest propaganda piece. &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; had not been released at the time this book went to press, but the authors accurately hit the nail on the head telling the reader what will be in it, just by knowing Moore's history and how predictable he is. <br />  <br /> I found this book to be so informative I began to keep a pencil handy to underline and check certain passages so I could refer back to them later. One thing that really struck me is how often Moore contradicts himself, and how when anything doesn't go his way, he starts screaming about there being a conspiracy against him. Or, he will fabricate a conspiracy ifit will help him make a few more bucks. Example: Moore publicly accused Disney and Miramax of censoring him by not distributing &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11.&quot; But the authors state &quot;later, Moore lets it slip on CNN that he'd been told nearly a year before that Miramax would not be his American distributor-which means that unless he'd somehow forgotten for all that time that he didn't have a distributor, all had been arranged in advance.&quot; <br />  <br /> Don't let the title of this book fool you. It is not a light-weight, mindless attack on Michael Moore. These authors did pain-staking research on Moore. This is a serious book chocked full of statistics and facts, and unlike Moore, I bet they will let the chips fall where they may. <br />	2004-08-06

I have never heard of anyone going to an anesthesiologist for a mental problem, unless they beg to be euthanized and put out of their misery.  The reviewer from London, UK also says maybe Betty's attempts to escape Iran was the cause of her husband's anger and abuse.  Well, since her husband had promised they were only going for a 2-week visit to Iran to visit his family, and then held her against her will there, I think she had the right to be very angry herself.  Too bad she couldn't give back some of the beatings he gave her.  Also, Betty said they bathed every two months, not once a year.  <br />I marvel at Betty's determination and courage.

Pistone	Books	5	2	10	N	N	Good Non-fiction	I just finished reading this book and it was worth it.  I love non-fiction, and this is a great true story of an FBI agent who successfully infiltrated the Mob for 6 years in the late 1970s to early 1980s.  Joseph Pistone aka Donnie Brasco, took his time, and slowly but surely, got to know characters in organized crime and moved up in the hierarchy.  He had some close calls along the way, and it amazes me that he never got whacked (mob term).  Pistone even took the mobsters on a nice boat ride on a boat owned by the FBI - his partner Lefty later found out about the boat - and yet Pistone/Brasco was able to talk his way out of it!  Amazing.  This guy was so quick on his feet.  Talk about guts - this guy was something else.  But also, Lefty and Sonny Black, another mobster, really liked Donnie Brasco.  Reading this book showed me that being well liked by at least two influential mobsters could go a long way to save you from being whacked.<br />Even though I know what these guys were, thieves, liars, killers, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Sonny when he tells Donnie Brasco how much he trusts him - trust him more than anyone in his crew - how much he liked him.  The reader knows Brasco is the last person Sonny can trust.  Maybe I shouldn't care, but if you really trust and like someone, it hurts so much to be betrayed.  And Sonny, who Pistone/Brasco really liked in spite of everything, doesn't have a pretty ending.<br />As a woman, I couldn't help but notice that Pistone never talks about women he saw or dated.  In reality, he was married with children, but he was pretending to be a swinging bachelor.  Lefty even accused him of wanting to lie on a beach and be a playboy. Hello!  Playboy - that's a red flag word if I ever heard it.  From what I can see of him in pictures, he was not a bad looking man, but from his book, you would think the mobsters never saw him (except here and there at first) with another woman.  He would just say he was going to New Jersey to seehis girl.  I can understand keeping anything about other women out of the book since he was/is a married man, and his wife read this book I'm sure.  But do I think he went six years without getting involved with another woman - and Lefty calls him a playboy?  Oh well, if he pretended to be a mobster, I guess he could just pretend to be a playboy.	2004-05-30

Deirdre Imus would have been smart to actually make this a cookbook for kids and cowboys, not for vegans.<br />Don Imus needs to stand up to his wife and eat some meat.  I saw Imus and his wife on Larry King the other night and he looked like a dead man propped up - pale and pasty.  I tape the Imus shows in the mornings to watch later.  It seems like he and his wife get sick alot.  Deirdre is still reasonably young and can get away with eating this wacky diet.  But Don, please, for heaven's sake, eat some steak!	2004-05-10

If I had read this book first, I would not have wanted to read more about James Dean.  I agree with another reviewer that this book focuses on his sexuality too much for my liking.  There are some details I don't want, or need to know, whether its same sex, or opposite sex.<br />The author of \\"Little Boy Lost,\\" Joe Hyams, knew James Dean, and he does give SOME information and details you may not get from a more objective person (too much information sometimes).  I did pick up details, extra bits about Dean from this book, and I'm glad I read it, but I'm also glad I'm through with it.  I did not feel that way when I finished \\"Rebel.\\"  I did not want that book to end.<br />To anyone who has never read a book about James Dean, doesn't know much about him, and want a good book to read, I would recommend reading Donald Spoto's book, \\"Rebel,\\" first.  I thought it was a well-rounded, informative, insightful book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  I would recommend reading this book by Joe Hyams, only if you want to read further about Dean after finishing the other book.	2004-03-23

Its even nicer than I thought it would be.  This is NOT just a picture book.  There is a foreword by Mel Gibson, and throughout the book, along with photography from the movie, is the story of \\"The Passion,\\" with Bible scriptures - book, chapter, and verse, noted to back up the story.  The pages are thick, with a rich feel and look.  It has a very nice dust jacket with a scene of Jesus being forced to carry his cross that extends from the front of the jacket to the back.  Take the dust jacket off, and the hardback cover has the same picture front to back.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who don't want to see the movie because they are afraid of the violence.  This is a great book.  It tells the Easter story and shows the story.	2004-03-12

I had never read any other James Dean books and I thought this was a very good book, very informative.  I didn't get bored or bogged down once.  I enjoyed every part of it - Jimmy's early life, life in New York, and his short, but brilliant Hollywood career.  I would get totally absorbed in reading it, sometimes staying up way too late just because I couldn't put it down.<br />I have read other reviews that consider this book &quot;generic&quot; or more detached, but since I am not a James Dean expert, and have never read a book on him before, I can only give my perspective and opinions.  I thought this was a very well-written and researched book.  I am now reading &quot;James Dean, little boy lost,&quot; by Joe Hyams, which I bought through an Amazon Marketplace buyer.	2004-03-02

She uses poems and journals by Ms. Plath to help her with writing her tale, but this is fiction, and listed under fiction.  Truman Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is a non-fiction book about the very real brutal murders of a family (the Clutters) in Kansas in the late 1950s, their killers, their capture and subsequent execution.  Capote used techniques of writing fiction to tell the true story of the Clutter murders, but he did not use fiction to tell his story.  He wanted to make it an interesting story, not just a journalistic report.  Truman Capote had access to most of the actual people involved in the Kansas murders.  But &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is a non-fiction/true story with no fiction in it.<br />&quot;Wintering&quot; cannot be compared to &quot;In Cold Blood,&quot; anymore than it can be compared to &quot;Fatal Vision,&quot; another non-fiction true crime book.  This &quot;novel&quot; about Sylvia Plath is an attempt to tell the last month's of Sylvia Plath's life.  You cannot compare a non-fiction true crime book to a novel about Plath's last months on earth.	2004-01-01

Yes, \\"Arrogance\\" is about bias in the media, but its more about the arrogance behind it - the refusal of the media elites to turn a critical eye on themselves.  Bernard Goldberg states in this book how, after \\"Bias\\" came out, the liberals came up with the argument that there is no liberal bias in the media.  There is a conservative bias!  Say what?!  For years Americans have had news presented to them with a leftist slant from ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, PBS, and MSNBC (MSNBC is getting better), and only Fox News and talk radio offered a voice for other minded people, and some of these elites can say there is a conservative bias with a straight face?  What a hoot.<br />This book offers new material about the New York Times, Frank Rich, and how many liberals today have become \\"illiberal.\\"  Goldberg states that anything having to do with Gay issues draws name calling \\"at the drop of a hat to shore up their own close-mindedness and orthodoxy.  They don't give credence to the \\"other side,\\" because deep down, I suspect, they don't think there is another side.\\"   Another quote from the book: \\"In Rich's work, the vicious accusation \\"homophobic,\\" \\"homophobia,\\" or \\"homophobe\\" turns up so often (forty times as of this writing!) its almost laughable.\\"  There is also a quote in the book where Dan Rather calls Juanita Broaddrick's rape accusation against Bill Clinton as \\"something to do with somebody's private sex life...\\"   Unbelievable!  What would Dan Rather have called it if Juanita had accused a Republican of rape?<br />There are interviews with Tim Russert and Bob Costas who Goldberg considers fair and balanced journalists (I agree).  He discusses specials Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer have done on gay adoption that have a clear message that if, by the end of the program, you don't think gay adoption is good, you are a bad, badperson.<br />I agree with other reviewers who say Mr. Goldberg's writing often takes on an angry, or even bitter tone at times, but I don't hold that against him.  What he is trying to do is a good thing, and all he is getting from the media elites is scorn or worse.  I would be angry too.  But Mr. Goldberg should take heart that he is a hero to millions of Americans.<br />I have one bone to pick with Goldberg.  In my opinion, he should have stayed with Regnery publishing and not gone over to Warner Books.  Regnery published \\"Bias\\" when no one else would.  I think they deserved his loyalty.  His switching to Warner Books may not attract all the extra readers he had hoped for.  I understand why he did it though.	2003-12-27

The forensic evidence and analysis all points to Oswald.  Even Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (who I am not particularly fond of) say all of their attempts to discredit the Warren Commission report have failed.  Reluctantly they concede that the case is closed - Oswald did it.  Dan Rather said something close to &quot;I always have an open mind, but basically, the case is closed.&quot;<br />As for the French assassin being deported-did he have &quot;French Assassin&quot; stamped on his passport as his occupation? Give me a break.  Hearsay, hearsay, hearsay.<br />The evidence speaks for itself.  It is just too unbelievable to some people that a loser who craved attention could climb six floors and shoot the president.  Deal with it.  It happened.  The forensic evidence points to the loser Oswald.	2003-12-01

Would you want to read what any eyewitness to the shooting that night had to say?  If you want a first hand account of what a beautiful day November 22, 1963, started out to be, and how horribly wrong it went, you will want this book.<br />Nellie Connally, wife of Texas Governor John Connally, was sitting directly in front of Jackie Kennedy in THAT car on THAT day, November 22, 1963.  She turned in time to see President Kennedy's hands fly up to his throat, saw the shocked look in his eyes, saw him slump in the seat.  Mrs. Connally then made a snap decision that she later learned saved her husband's life.<br />Also, Publisher's Weekly states that her description of her family's security needs afterwards and her accepting of the Warren Commission's findings &quot;are not of broad interest.&quot;  I wonder if the Publisher's Weekly reviewer saw any of the programs this past week where every one of these shows came to the conclusion Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone?  This was after painstaking analysis of forensic evidence, and looking into every crackpot theory imaginable.  I also found it very interesting to read about the fears and nightmares Mrs. Connally and her husband endured after that tragic day.  I can't believe anyone would consider that of no interest to the public.<br />I want to thank Nellie Connally for writing this book, and not only sharing this story with her grandchildren, but with all of us.  Mrs. Connally is truly a &quot;steel magnolia.&quot;  She has made a great contribution to the telling of the history of the 20th century, and that tragic day in November.	2003-11-24

Jazzy was only 3 years old and died from a mysterious, deadly ailment while spending the weekend in the country.<BR> <BR>Reading about Jazzy's death and Ms. Adam's sorrow and anger moved me deeply.

I had to stop and think about what I had read before I could continue.  I have read many, many self-help books in my life, but this is one of a very few books that hit right between the eyes, and grabbed my heart.<br />Sometimes people are unhappy, but don't really want to know what they are unhappy about, or what caused their unhappiness or depression.  They think they want to know, but if the truth starts to get too close, up go the defenses and denial.  Read this book only if you are ready to face the truth, whatever the truth may be.  This book states that only after you can face and accept realities about your childhood and upbringing, mourn for your losses and lost childhood, and how some needs can never be fulfilled because the time for them being met are long gone, can you really begin to live.<br />It would be nice if all therapists would read this book and others by Alice Miller.

There is a very sad story as she and George the elder visit President Reagan in his office after his diagnosis with Alzheimer's, and Mrs. Bush feels he has no idea who they are, but is his usual friendly, polite self.  They visited for a few minutes, then left.  She also tells how at her son's inauguration, all she could think about was how Al Gore must feel.  She said she didn't think Gore won the election, but was sure he thought he did.  Mrs. Bush states Gore was very cordial and came over to meet George and Laura's twin daughters.

I want to have a feel for the surroundings, but this was like eating too much rich cake.  Please, no more.  I stopped feeling like I was reading a book about Sylvia Plath, and began to feel like I was in an English literature or grammar class reading descriptive narrative for whatever benefit.<br />Maybe I'll go back to this book later and have a whole new perspective.

George Jacobs was Frank Sinatra's valet (cook, gofer, butler, girlfriend baby-sitter, you name it) from 1953 to 1968.  If you can name famous people who Frank Sinatra knew or associated with, they are probably mentioned in this book.  Jacobs grew to love Sinatra and he thought Sinatra cared about him too.  Then he had the curtain dropped on him just like many others before him.  Its obvious that Jacobs did have affection for his boss and was very loyal to him.<br />I saw Mr. Jacobs on \\"Hannity & Cohms\\" a while back and I thought they were too hard on him.  This is not a \\"trash Frank Sinatra\\" book.  Its told with great affection but Jacobs is honest about what he saw and experienced.

If the book bores you, the movie will not. This movie came out 1954-55.  Dean's portrayal of Cal Trask is powerful and moving. I could identify with his feelings as a young person who desperately wants his father's love and approval, but is not the favorite child, and can never please his father. The role of the stern father is played by Raymond Massey.  The TV movie \\"East of Eden\\" with Jane Seymour was good too, and covers more of the book, but I prefer the original movie for obvious reasons (James Dean).	2003-07-20

There are some very moving stories about the twilight years of Mickey's career and the respect and reverence felt for him by opposing teams.  One act of respect - no bunting on Mickey because of his bad knees.  And one opposing team pitcher deliberately threw Mickey a home run pitch just to see him hit it out of the park.<br />This book goes back to Mickey's childhood, and how his father would come home after working all day in the mines, go out back with Mickey and neighborhood friends and play baseball until dark.  Mickey was right-handed, but his father would make him hit left-handed to teach him how to be a switch hitter (which Mickey hated having to do at the time).<br />This book is full of interesting stories and antedotes about Mickey's life.  One thing this book did not answer for me that I have questions about: Mickey lived with another woman the last 10 years of his life, but never divorced Merlyn, his first and only wife.  Why did he never divorce and remarry this woman?  Why did he stay married to Merlyn?  What were the reasons that Merlyn never left, or Mickey didn't?<br />All in all, a great book if you are wanting to learn more about Mickey Mantle.	2003-07-02

I have been reading up on Mickey Mantle since seeing the movie 61*, about the Mantle/Maris race to beat Babe Ruth's single season home run record.  I checked this book out of the library to see why there was so much hostility towards Jim Bouton, and why he was never invited to NY Yankee Old Timer's Days after writing this book.  He always thought it was Mickey Mantle who was keeping him from attending.  After Mantle died in 1995, he still didn't get invited - so that shoots that one down.  Bouton learned a lesson.  People actually LIKED Mickey Mantle and felt offended by what Bouton said about him in \\"Ball Four.\\"<br />He starts out talking about how nice Mickey was to him, different things he did that were touching, kind.  But then he proceeds to tell us how he had mixed feelings for Mickey because he saw Mickey shut a bus window on a group of kids wanting autographs.  And he refused to sign balls in the clubhouse one time.  Jim Bouton was never Mickey Mantle, and its too bad he never knew what it was to be hounded day and night and never have a minute of privacy.  So Mantle shut a bus window on some kids once.  Knowing what I do about the fame Mantle created and endured during his ball playing days, I can't understand why Bouton even found that important enough to write about.<br />Oh, that's right.  Money.  He made alot of money writing this book to trash his fellow baseball players.  Otherwise, would any of us remember Jim Bouton for anything else?	2003-06-24

This book was so much more than I initially thought it would be.  The title sounds like it will be a blind love letter to Ronald Reagan, with a book full of \\"he's so great,\\" \\"I love him.\\"  Blind Reagan haters see the title and go into venom-spewing convulsions.  If I had to describe this book in a nutshell, I would say this book describes Ronald Reagan, what shaped him, what changed him, and how fighting communism and big government became his missions in life.<br />Reagan was a \\"New Deal\\" liberal democrat in the 1930s and 40s. He spoke against neofascism and all its evils.  (Hitler was a fascist) One evening, after speaking to another group, a minister told him he should also say something against communism.  Reagan had never had a concern about communism.  That was across the ocean in the Soviet Union, not in the United States.  And Reagan was a Democrat.  He thought anti-communism was something Republicans worried about.  At his next speaking engagement he got rounds of applause throughout, until the end.  To quote the book:  \\"He said that though there is a continuing threat of fascism in the new world following the war, there is \\"another ism.\\"  It is communism, and \\"if I ever find evidence that communism represents a threat to all that we believe in and stand for, I'll speak out just as harshly against communism as I have fascism.\\"  He walked off the stage to something he wasn't used to hearing: silence.  He remembered it as shattering, an actual shock.\\"<br />Thus began Reagan's awakening to the sinister, under-the-radar movement of the Communist Party.  Olivia de Havilland, William Holden, Jimmy Roosevelt (FDR's son) and others set out to expose and disable the communist plot to take over the movie industry.  Leading the charge was Ronald Reagan.  I found this part of the book one of the most interesting to read.  Ms. Noonan could have written a book about Reagan's successful effort to thwart the communist take-over of Hollywood.  I think it would be a best-seller and a real page-turner (Peggy, think about it).  Ms. Noonan writes that the actor Sterling Hayden, who had joined the Communist Party, only to renounce it shortly afterwards, said the reason the communists did not take over the industry was because of Reagan.  From the book:  \\"Hayden said they ran into 'a one-man battalion of opposition' named Ronald Reagan.\\"<br />The other part that especially interested me was the so-called \\"arms for hostages\\" deal.  I had never completely understood what went on during this period, and Ms. Noonan describes it in detail and with great clarity.  Considering what happened to us on Sept 11, 2001, this section carried even more weight with me, and showed we were being duped and back-stabbed even then.  Trust me, this section alone makes the book worth reading.<br />Ms. Noonan also lists promises Reagan made and kept: Cut the inflation rate, cut taxes, get the economy going again, decontrol oil prices, reduce unemployment, lower interest rates, cut the budget, name the first woman to the US Supreme Court, and promised he would not knuckle under to the Soviet Union, \\"and vowed to speak truthfully both of it and to it.\\"<br />The only criticism I have of the book is the way it begins.  The coming together of old Reagan White House staff and workers for the christening of the aircraft carrier \\"Ronald Reagan,\\" was like reading about someone's boring family reunion.  This should have been mentioned, but towards the end, and spare us the boring details.  I couldn't wait to get past this part and get into the meat of Ronald Reagan's life.  Reagan wasn't there, so do I need to know that Don Regan considers himself a great painter now, and that he and Nancy spoke?  Who cares.  Thankfully, this section passes quickly and we're off to the races.	2002-08-01

Leslie was at the LaBianca house, not the Tate house.  She did not kill Mrs. LaBianca, Krenwinkle did.  But, Charles Manson had told Tex to make sure everyone got their hands dirty, so Tex told Leslie to go do something.  Leslie stabbed Mrs. LaBianca AFTER she was dead.<br />Sure, Leslie was unrepentent at first.  But for years now, she has seen the error of her ways, turned her back on Manson and his followers, and been completely rehabilitated.  Sure they were horrible crimes, but ask yourself this:  If Leslie were not associated with someone named Charles Manson, do you think she would have been paroled by now?<br />I hope Leslie makes parole one of these days, but she is the only one of the Manson \\"killers\\" I want to get out.

Anyone who read the Bernard Goldberg book, \\"Bias,\\" and enjoyed it would love this book.  The author, Tammy Bruce, was the president of the LA chapter of NOW in the early nineties.  She is an openly Gay feminist, she thought NOW was a feminist organization, and looked forward to furthering feminist causes.  She got a rude awakening.  NOW seemed to be nothing more than a front for Leftist/communist causes.  During the OJ Simpson murder trial, Tammy Bruce repeatedly tried to keep the emphasis on domestic violence, while national NOW saw it as a civil rights issue.  To quote from her book, \\"Photographs of Nicole Brown Simpson's bruised face and recordings of her desperate 911 calls horrified the nation.  But they apparently did not horrify National NOW.  The silence from the feminist establishment was deafening.\\"<br />She also tells how the OJ debacle and her fight against domestic violence during that period changed her views of conservatives.  Many conservatives wanted to contribute to her domestic violence cause.  To quote from the book, \\"Religious, pro-life, and other conservatives who wrote a check to Los Angeles NOW because it was the right thing to do changed me.  It was then I realized, although we disagreed on many issues, there were fundamental questions about values that truly separated conservatives from postmodern liberals.  For me, that finally exposed by counterpoint the soullessness of the Left.\\"  <br />This book is chocked full of statistics, examples, and Tammy speaks as an insider who has been there, and done that.  She discusses how the Left has become what, in the 1960s, it supposedly was fighting.  She discusses hypocrisy in the Gay community, \\"the Misery Merchants,\\" concerning the black civil rights activists, multiculturalism and how un-American and/or anti-American it really is, the thought police in entertainment and news, and the leftist agenda in academia.<br />If you can handlethe truth, this book is for you.	2002-03-01

US	52159798	RTOZJP6ELDY05	0060957611	772222820	Understanding Thomas Jefferson	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A Different Perspective	Emphasis on the slave girl/woman Sally Hemings is woven throughout the book.  If you are not interested in her, don't read this book.  The author is a good writer as far as making his subject interesting, and maybe he thinks a book was needed with an emphasis on Hemings.<br />This is not the first I have read on Thomas Jefferson, and I'm glad of that because I do think the emphasis on Sally Hemings makes this book something to read AFTER you have already studied Thomas Jefferson from a historical point of view on his importance to the creation of The United States of America.<br />On the importance of Sally Hemings here is what I glean from all of this.  Thomas Jefferson was married once to Martha Wayles Skelton, widow of Bathurst Skelton, daughter of John Wayles.  By all accounts, Jefferson was completely and utterly faithful to Martha.  He adored her and loved her passionately.  John Wayles fathered Sally Hemings, making Sally, Martha's half-sister.  After 10 years of marriage Martha died leaving Jefferson devastated.  They say he could not even bear to discuss her his pain was so great.  He never remarried.  But at some point he did begin a long affair with Sally Hemings.  The fact that Hemings was Martha's half-sister is very revealing to me and makes me feel great sympathy for Jefferson, not contempt.<br />Overall though, the Sally Hemings angle is not important to the founding of our great nation, or Thomas Jefferson, other than to explain why he had any bond with her at all.  It all goes back to his beloved wife Martha, who died way too soon.	2002-02-23

I cherish this book.  There are a few rules that are dated, but they are entertaining.  The rest is pure gold and timeless.<br />A few examples:<br />5.  If you cough, sneeze, sigh, or yawn, do it not loud but privately; and speak not in your yawning, but put your hankerchief or hand before your face and turn aside.<br />65.  Speak not injurious words neither in jest nor earnest; scoff at none although they give occasion.<br />82.  Undertake not what you cannot perform but be careful to keep your promise.<br />If you can't figure out what to give that new graduate who already has everything, I highly recommend this book.

US	52159798	R37LDZQZMBDDOY	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Independence Forever!	I'm so glad I read this book.  I learned alot about John and Abigail Adams, along with other figures from those history-making revolutionary times.  This is a very well-researched, painstakingly so, tome.<br />I do have one complaint.  In my opinion, the author always tried to justify John Adams, even when he was being criticized by those around him for some action or behavior, and, in my opinion, he usually drew negative connotations from Thomas Jefferson's actions and behavior.  I came away from finishing the book with the impression the author truly disliked Jefferson.  Say what you will, Jefferson was a two-term president while Adams was a one termer.  Jefferson was tremendously popular during his time and not for no reason.  I also wonder if the part of the country Adams and the author are both from affected the author's attitude towards Jefferson, a Virginian, and a Southerner.<br />The author also talks about how Adams was not a rich man.  At his death he was worth $100,000.  In 1826, that was not small potatoes.  Whether Adams lived frugally or not, for his time he was considered wealthy.<br />The first half of the book was harder for me to read than the second half.  Parts would be tedious, then be very interesting, then might be very painful to read.  Adams time in Europe, especially Holland was not easy reading for me.  It was depressing and painful.  I don't know how Abigail survived the separations she had to endure.  Her letters to John sometimes took two months to reach him, and vice versa.<br />The second half of the book was about the birth of our nation and all the growing pains that went with it.  When we first started electing presidents, whoever got the second most votes got to be Vice President.  Also, as our second President, John Adams kept George Washington's cabinet.  Big mistake.  It was fascinating to me to read how our founding fathers had to learn painful lessons from experience.<br />Its also sad how the Adams's oldest son, John Quincy, was such a success, but their two youngest sons struggled, one of them becoming an alcoholic and dying young.  This is barely touched upon in the book, but enough to make the reader think about how and why.<br />I recommend this book to those who love to read history, and who have a burning desire to learn more about our founding fathers,  the Revolutionary War period, and the birth of our government.  As John Adams said, \\"Independence forever!\\"	2002-02-01

Its one of those books that completely draws you in.  By the time I finished it, I was convinced without a shadow of a doubt that Anna Anderson was indeed Anastasia.  I was so convinced that when DNA tests were done in the early 90s and experts declared that Ms. Anderson was not Anastasia, I thought it had to be a mistake. I still find it hard to believe that it was not her.  She knew things that only someone inside the Romanov family inner circle would know.  If Anna was not Anastasia she even managed to fool an old childhood friend of Anastasia.<br />The woman was either psychic, lucky and an incredible actress, or she was the real deal and the DNA tests were a crock.	2001-11-10

I will be reading along and suddenly laugh out loud over something he has said just because it is so plain-spokenly blunt.  Of course I would hate for that bluntness to be used against me.<br />Curtis is kind towards his first wife Janet Leigh.  Maybe that is because she has been kind towards him.  It seems that he doesn't have much to do with his other ex-wives. At the time this book was published he was married to a girl named Lisa.<br />Curtis also was/is very sensitive about his being Jewish and how he was picked on as a kid, and as an adult (the stuffed, taped tail-pipe in Germany-read the book to find out what that is about).<br />Curtis was always a very good-looking man and he knew it, and he's honest about knowing it.  His idol was Cary Grant.  He wanted to make movies with Marilyn Monroe and Mae West so he could say he and Grant were the only actors to make movies with both.  Curtis' tale about filming &quot;Sextette&quot; with Mae West is hilarious.<br />I love his honesty, but there is alot of anger in him.  Too bad he couldn't get therapy to work that out.  It probably contributed to the break-down of his marriages, and his drug habits in the past.  You have to give him credit for surviving though.<br />I have to say that his performance in &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; is one of my very favorites.  He and Natalie Wood had such a strong on-screen chemistry.	2001-09-02

He thinks Ross Perot is great.  He read it in three days.<br />It is truly astounding that Mr. Perot pulled off this daring rescue.

Amazing.

I find it very interesting that Frances studied drama at the University of Washington, went to Hollywood to become an actress/star, but oh, she hated all that glamour movie star business.  She wanted to be a communist, share and share alike.  Yeah right.  If she hated Hollywood and all it stood for, why did she go there to begin with?  Please don't make me laugh and tell me she didn't know how Hollywood was.  Hollywood was the dream factory in the 1930s.  Stars were worshipped.  That was the &quot;golden era&quot; of Hollywood.  <br />Frances had a real rebellious streak.  She was born too early.  She should have been young in the 1960s.

The liberal professor picked out four books we had to read and discuss, and this was one of them. Some of us in the class decided he had no idea this book would be so pro-religion because he wouldn't even discuss the book at the end of the semester like he did the other books.  Many of us were laughing up our sleeves. lol  This book is excellent in discussing and exposing how religion has been shoved out of public life, and some of the absurdities that go on in our classrooms today.  For example, refusing to allow the Bible to be in a grade school classroom bookshelf, but allowing books on the occult and ancient indian religions.  I mentioned this to my professor and he said &quot;Well, they would try to influence you (meaning the Bible and whoever put it there).&quot;  Excuse me??  Its ok for the occult to influence our children, but not the Bible?  This book and that professor's remark shows the insanity of what liberals are trying to do to this country today. If you are interested in the culture war raging in the U.S., this book is for you.	2001-01-15

Sometimes I get it out and re-read parts of the book.  Its too bad that someone couldn't help Dennis help himself, or force him to help himself.  But how do you force someone to save themselves?  You can only keep them locked up for so long (like Robert Downey, Jr.).  If someone wants to kill themselves, is there any way to stop it?<br />After reading and studying Dennis, I see a talented, restless young man who never really believed in himself at his core.  He had movie star good looks with the requisite charisma.  Dennis probably could have had a successful acting career if he had wanted it, but he was too restless, maybe too unsure of himself. Dennis was a California golden boy, a ray of sunshine, the epitomy of reckless youth, with a heart of gold underneath his bravado.  If only Dennis could have loved himself as much as others loved him.  We miss you Denny.	2000-12-30

Its &quot;Step-Mommie Dearest.&quot;  I have nothing but sympathy for Tina and how she describes her father's fourth and last wife, Barbara.  Tina also talks in her book how she became good friends with Sinatra's third wife, Mia Farrow (who was only a few years older than Tina), and their friendship lasts to this day.  She said she never felt threatened by Mia. <br />Tina's love for her father comes across in every page, and also the ache in her heart that never went away.  A daughter who always longed for a deeper relationship with her father, felt threatened by a woman (Barbara) who she felt only wanted to push his three children farther and farther away.  Tina, you go girl!	2000-12-11

Only in the last 6 months have I been interested in learning about the group as individuals, etc.  I read &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; by Steven Gaines first. I found the book  very informative, with no sugar coating.  Next I got this book to read.<br />I  can't tell you how disappointing this book was to me.  Do I care to read  about the grandparents and their lives in Kansas, and how they migrated to  Southern California?  The furthest back I want to go is to Murry and  Audrey, maybe a brief summary of their upbringings, how they met, married,  bore their three talented sons - and then off we go from there.  I don't  care about a long, detailed description of the vegetation and climate of  Kansas OR California.  Just give me the feel of the place, ok?<br />I tried to  read this book page for page, but I could not do it.  I found myself  turning the pages until I saw at least one of the Beach Boys names, and  read whatever it said about them.  Also I was very disappointed that this  book concentrated so much on Brian and pushed Carl and Dennis into the  background.  Of course Brian was the songwriting brains behind the group,   but without the help of his brothers (especially the inspiration Dennis  provided for the writing of surfing songs and the Southern California  myth), and the other members, Brian probably would have been just another  &quot;genius&quot; songwriter who never got his recognition. I also felt  that Mr. White went into long needless detours with characters whose impact  on the Beach Boys was minimal, if at all. <br />I would give this book two  stars, but I cannot do it for one main reason.  Towards the end of the book  (page 339 of the hardback copy to be exact) Mr. White writes that Dennis  Wilson is &quot;the youngest Wilson brother&quot;...  This man wrote a book  about the Beach Boys and didn't even bother to find out that Brian is the  oldest son, Dennis the middle, and Carl the youngest?   Noexcuses.	2000-06-24

Suicide always helps to enhance a person's worth in the art and literary world.  Does that sound harsh or cynical?  I  bet Ms. Plath would agree.  Her suicide was a great career move.<br />I just  recently read this book and it is well written and interesting.  I heard  &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was semi-autobiographical even though it is listed  under fiction and called a novel.  I mostly wanted to read it because I too  have suffered from depression and wanted to see if I could identify with  anything Sylvia Plath wrote.  Yes I did, with many things.  I especially  identified with Esther not wanting to bathe and how it seemed a waste of  time. I never went three weeks without bathing like she did, but I did get  where I considered showering and washing my hair a waste of time, like she  said, because we would just have to do it again.  That's only one example  from the book.  <br />I would like to read a good biography of Sylvia Plath  now to see if I could get some insight into things that &quot;The Bell  Jar&quot; left dangling for me, such as why she/Esther disliked her mother  so much.	2000-05-21

It doesn't white-wash them either, but I think Steven Gaines mostly wanted to tell it like it was.  Only once or twice did I think Gaines  seemed alittle hostile towards one or more of the group members. <br />The  book starts out with Dennis Wilson and the last month of his life.  I  remember hearing about Dennis drowning but never knew much of the details,  only that he had been diving where his boat had been docked.  I think it  was very smart to start the book out this way because I was hooked from  then on.  Gaines ties up any loose ends about the day Dennis died towards  the end of the book.  Of course this book is not current with regard to  Carl Wilson's death since it was published in the mid-1980s.<br />What really  gives this book credibility is all the people closely associated with the  Beach Boys who talked with the author, even the Beach Boys themselves.   After finishing the book, I have wondered if any of them regretted it.  Its  no tip-toe through the tulips.  I gave this book 5 stars because I didn't  get bored once while reading it.  Its interesting from beginning to end.	2000-04-26

If you have never thought much about being wheelchair-bound, you will experience being in a wheelchair through him.  You may  even have a new appreciation for  handicapped parking spaces and wheelchair accessible bathroom stalls.  I  know I do.  <br />This is the story of a young man who was normal in every way  until he was 19 years old.  Then a terrible car accident made him a  paraplegic and instead of hiding in his bedroom the rest of his life, he  went out and got a life.  John Hockenberry has done more as a paraplegic  than  most people who are fully functional.	2000-02-25

I just finished reading this book the other day.  Being a patient will never be the same again.  To read how the medical community either covered up for Michael Swango, or just didn't want to believe a doctor could be  capable of poisoning patients, is unsettling to say the least.  Nurses,  hospital workers, and patients were all discounted by some physicians as  just &quot;gossips.&quot;  Even a conviction of trying to poison co-workers  wasn't enough to stop Swango from getting employment.  There were some who  knew Michael Swango was bad news even in medical school, but their concerns  went unheeded.  Its frightening.  Every person, whether in the medical  field or not, should read this book.  <br />And to think that this guy is  about to get out of prison!	1999-12-17

Between the two I found this book very interesting about Mr. Kazan's career in the theatre and movies.  He knew many big names, and worked with alot of them.   I rented the video &quot;On the Waterfront,&quot; for the first time while  reading this book.  Mr. Kazan said &quot;Waterfront&quot; was his movie,  his statement on how he felt about  testifying before the Un-American  Activities Committee in Washington, D.C.  Personally, I applaud Mr. Kazan  for his courage in naming names. Communism was a real threat to our  country.  Elia Kazan should know.  He was one of them at one time.	1999-10-13

The mother wouldn't even let the girls  go in the water on the beach!  Obviously, they had no idea how vulnerable  they would be on a boat surrounded by water.  If the Death Penalty was made  for one person, its Oba Chandler.  He should die the way his victims did.   They ought to go out on the ocean, tie and gag him, molest him, and then  throw him overboard with a 40 lb. cement block tied to his neck.

If I tried to explain all the reasons I love this book, it would take up too much space.  &quot;Harpo Speaks&quot; is interesting from the  first page to the last.  Its funny, and Harpo's deep down decency and  goodness comes through the whole book.  I felt sorry for him sometimes, but  he never felt sorry for himself.  He saw the humor in almost everything.   He never lost his child-like sense of wonder or mischief.  I dare anyone to  read this book and come away without deep admiration for the  &quot;silent&quot; Marx brother.	1999-10-10

The argument that Marilyn was murdered is very strong, and this book came out at a time when the murder/cover-up conspiracy argument was still considered  alittle far-fetched.<br />More information has come out since this book was  published, such as her housekeeper admitting that Robert Kennedy HAD been  to Marilyn's house the last day of her life.  When Slatzer's book came out,  the housekeeper was still denying it.  But Slatzer had an eye witness  account from a neighbor of Marilyn's who had seen Kennedy there that day.<br />Time has only proven that Robert Slatzer was on the right path, as far  as there being a cover-up. As for Marilyn being murdered, you be the judge.	1999-09-06

Artie Shaw was the handsome big band leader during the 1940s, and  early 1950s, who played a mean clarinet.  His band leader days were over by  the time they married though.  It should have made Ava Gardner feel better  to know that Artie Shaw was a jerk to every woman he was married to, not  just her.<br />The rest of the book is interesting also.  Her first husband  committed suicide when she left him, and she said she never left another  man again.  She made them leave her.  And the marriage to John Huston -  they got married on a whim, but it was more her whim than his.  I'm  surprised it lasted as long as it did.  Through Huston, she knew and liked  Bogie and Bacall, she adored Paulette Goddard, resented Vivien Leigh in  later years when she felt Leigh still treated her like a &quot;bit  player.&quot;  Good dish.	1999-09-04

Her childlike sense  of fun, her love of animals, her loyalty to friends, just to name a few.   Her loyalty and devotion to &quot;WR&quot; would stand out at a time when  he was in dire financial straits.  Also, this book is interesting in that  it gives us a glimpse of the golden era of Hollywood.  There are serious  moments in the book, but overall it is light-hearted and amusing. She  wasn't really shallow or an air-head.  The girl just liked to have fun!	1999-09-01

Old Joe Kennedy cared about one thing:  his pocketbook and how fat he could get it.  And power, of course, but money is power, right?  A more ruthless, cut-throat man has never lived.   He used people and discarded them without blinking an eye.  Some  pie-in-the-sky Kennedy fans want to think the Kennedys went into politics,  I mean public service, for virtuous reasons.  When Joe Kennedy Jr. died  over the English Channel, Joe Sr. turned to &quot;Jack&quot; Kennedy and  handed him the responsibility of becoming president.  It wasn't a choice,  it was a demand.  Why did Jack make Bobby his attorney general after he  became President, even though Bobby didn't have the experience for the job?   The old man demanded it.  Jack, as a grown man, and already a Senator, had  to ask his father for money to go out with a girlfriend.  He controlled his  children by controlling their access to his money.<br />That's just the tip of  the iceberg.  After you read this book, you'll know that the title is very  appropriate.	1999-08-04

One reason, simply, is because its easy to read.  As a woman who is studying Catholicism myself, I identified with Kimberly Hahn's emotional  struggle.  Anyone who thinks she is being melodramatic, hasn't been raised  in a devout Protestant (anti-Catholic) home.  It is a roller coaster of  emotions.  This is the first Catholic conversion book I've read where I  didn't get alittle bored before I got through with it.  I highly recommend  &quot;Rome Sweet Home&quot; to anyone looking into the Catholic Church.	1999-07-18

Boy was I disappointed.  I was around during the Watergate era (in high school) and watched quite a  bit of the hearings on T.V.  But I found the book very hard to read.  To me  it was almost like reading the geneology sections in the Bible where  so-and-so beget so-and-so, one name after another.  Boring.  Too many names  thrown at me in too short a span.  I kept expecting it to kick in and I'd  be hooked.  After maybe 20 pages of the book I said &quot;enough&quot; and  watched the movie again.	1999-07-12

Well, I made the mistake of watching it one night on cable and couldn't stop crying.  No joke.  I was still crying the  next day.  It upset me.  So I got the book &quot;Born Free,&quot; and read  it in just two or three days.  I felt better after reading the book,  because in the movie, Elsa, the lion, being left alone to fend for herself  in the wild seemed very cruel to me.  I got angry at Joy Adamson.  The book  shows that Elsa wasn't just thrown out into the wild all of a sudden.  It  was more gradual.  I still felt sorry for Elsa though.  I think Elsa should  have been sent to the zoo (in Holland I think) with her sisters.  She died  way too young.  Joy was very selfish in keeping Elsa and then forcing her  to learn how to live in the wild when she had been so domesticated and  pampered as a house pet.  She really wasn't thinking of Elsa, only of  herself.	1999-06-01

For saying bad things about somebody.  It wasn't worded that way, (I think it was called disseminating untrue or scandalous information  about someone) but that basically is what it was.  I was shocked!  Colson  could have avoided prison altogether, IF he would admit he knew about the  Watergate break-in beforehand.  He didn't know about it, and he wouldn't  lie and say he did.  So he went to prison.  Explain that one to me....no,  never mind,  I know what it was.  POLITICS.  A form of lynching if you ask  me.  So Colson went to prison for something that wouldn't normally send a  person to prison.  Reading &quot;Born Again&quot; was a real eye opener.   &quot;They&quot; were determined to send him to prison for something.   Anyway, changing gears.....<br />This book involves politics and a great  conversion story.  I couldn't stop the tears from flowing.  I cried me a  river while reading &quot;Born Again.&quot;  Not since reading  &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; when I was a little girl have I cried so much.   I came away with a great respect for Charles Colson.  He may have been a  cut throat politician in many ways, but I also saw a great loyalty to his  friends that I found endearing.  Even after it was all said and done,  Mr.  Colson still had affection for  President Nixon.  I can only admire him for  that.<br />This is a great book, a great story.  God Bless Charles Colson.	1999-05-31
