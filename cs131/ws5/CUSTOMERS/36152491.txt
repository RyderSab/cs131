When I heard this book was written by the same author as \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" I expected nothing more than a sheer girlish book..(Which isn't bad from time to time.) The result was near surprising. I was literally HOOKED on this book from the first page on. When I reached about chapter 2, I claimed the book to be one of the best young adult books I've ever read.<br />Jessica M was an average girl. She wasn't a popular girl..the only real friend she had is Ruth. When Ruth gets insulted by a fellow class mate about her weight, she feels walking home during a storm would help. She dragged Jess to come along, and Jess followed..only to be met up with lightning on the way. They took cover under some METAL bleachers and Jessica held on for dear life. Next thing she knows, she is being bolted by the lightning. She wakes up to Ruth's pleas and she knows where some missing children are. Surely, this stirred up alot of trouble, causing the FBI and tons of news reporters to follow her. What ever can this one average girl Jessica do?<br />I can easily say this is one of the best books I've read. I, an average teenager, found this book to be very interesting. When I read on, continuing the series, I grew quite dissapointed, because none were as good as the first. I really reccomend this book to anyone. Jessica pulls you into her life and doesn't let go until the very end. Jenny Carroll leaves you wanting more. You surely won't be dissapointed with this great read.	2002-12-23

Jenny's second addition to \\"1-800-Where-R-You\\" isn't as good as the first, but still offers the readers a second Jess adventure that has been anticipated since the first. When I read \\"When Lightning Strikes\\" I knew I would have to read \\"Code Name Cassandra\\".<br />Jess isn't an average girl anymore..she's developed an ability to track down missing people in her head, when, after walking home with her friend Ruth, gets struck by lightning. She thinks everything is alright, since well now she's been denying her powers. But how long can she hide the truth? Jess' best friend convinces Jess to join a summer camp for musically gifted children. There, she must guide a group of hyper young boys. When an upset father comes pleading Jessica to find his missing daughter, she has no hope but to help him. All this results in an angry step father plotting to kill Jess..and a boy, who wasn't so special to Jess at first, become to the most important thing in Jess' life. Here she must enter a cave to save him and of course, hide from the angry step father..<br />This second book to the series will not be a dissapointment. This book gets very suspenseful near the end, when the step father is following her in the cave. The story is a little complicated for younger readers, but is enjoyable none the less. You won't be dissapointed with Jenny Carroll's second edition to \\"1-800-Where-R-You\\".	2002-12-23

Although, not best in the series	Princess Diaries volume III, Princess In Love, revolves around Mia's love life. She's finally got a boyfriend, but, she didn't expect it to be Kenny, and 'average' boy. She was leaning towards Michael, her best friend's older brother. So she is with him, what next? Nothing, she doesn't even like him. Throughout this book, Mia explores true love, and at the end, recieves a big surprise.<br />This book is awesome, but not the best in the series. It is better than book 2, but it can't top book 1. I recommend this book to Princess Diaries fan, and the Angus Thongs Full Frontal Snogging fan. Basically anyone who enjoys a book about teenagers, and their lives, will enjoy Princess In Love.	2002-10-06

Jessica, the main character, is an average girl in high school, that is, until her best friend (who is a bit over-weight) Ruth decides to take a walk from school to home. <br />As they are walking, a storm begins and they must find cover, for lightening begins to take charge in the sky. Jessica and Ruth are so desperate for cover, they go under a metal set of bleachers. Jessica clings onto it, and then, gets struck by lighting. From then on, Jessica isn't the same Jessica that decided to walk home with her best friend...<br />This is an awesome book that had me hooked from page one all the way until the back. Jenny Carroll/Meggin Cabot is an awesome author, and being a big Princess Diaries fan, I was happy to see she was not only a good author in that series, but overall.	2002-09-29

It teaches the values and importance of people of other countries, nations, and colors. Not only is it set for reading of any ages, it is interesting to the older audience as well. I think Vicki Grove did a tremendous job on this book.<br />Frannie is an average white girl entering the 8th grade school year. She has friends and family that all care about her, and her life is running smoothly, until the day she sees young Celeste in a black car. Celeste is like no other in the city, she is African-American. At first, Frannie ignores Celeste in school, and doesn't care about her, but it's impossible to ignore her forever, in chorus she is the best singer around. They quickyl socialize a bit and become fast friends. The name \\"The Star Place\\" came from the place Frannie and Celeste practice every night, it soon becomes a second home, and a second life to the culture of the city Quiver.<br />This book is awesome and is a must read for people of all skin colors. There really isnt a special age you have to be to read this book. I first read it in 3rd grade, and have re-read it over the years. This book definetly deserves all the credit it gets.	2002-09-19

The author promised to go through with Alice through all her years in highschool and a book that highlights Alice through age 18-60. Here is starts off as Alice's first year in highschool kicks off. At first everything is perfect, her boyfriend Patrick, schools going smoothly, and she's even having a coed sleepover at her house! But things start going downhill from there.

And as Alice struggles, she has to handle some news about her dad's fiancee. Alice learns what trusts all about, and having confidence in yourself and in others is the most important thing of all.<br />I recomend this book to anyone in middle to anyone in high. The Alice series is truly tremendous and knows what she's doing. She's woven up all the characters and put them in a story of love, and self discovery. Truly a great read...	2002-08-15

It starts of early with her and continues on until college. At first she knows something is up, but depression never came to mind. As time goes on, she realizes her problem and goes through the struggle of being someone else, a deppression patient. Life goes on for her and this book has a great climax to it. I haven't read the first book by this author, but reading this book makes me want to. <br />Any teen or adult should pick up this book, it's very interesting and not to medical. It flows through and makes you want to read more and more. You'll be sad that it ended! Well, have fun reading.	2002-08-07

In this tale of horror and romance, Amelia gives to you Jessica, an average teen with a problem. No one wants to be her friend, everyone is taken aback from her. The day Caryn Smoke moves to her class, is the day her life changes forever. Caryn attempts being her friend, but fails, too scared from Jessica's rudeness to her.<br />Soon 'Alex' moves into her class, and is quite similar to a character in a book she wrote; 'Tiger, Tiger'. As time goes on she finds out that all the fiction she wrote in her books, are actually true, and it's a threat to her life. She must face a decision that will change her life forever.<br />This is my favorite book by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and my favorite character is Aubrey, the vampire. If it's a picture of him on the cover, he's cute too. Well, I think ever teen horror fan should read this. It's really a worthy read!	2002-07-31

If you are looking for a book like &quot;Angus Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging&quot;-than this book is for you! I was reading some reviews of this book before I read it, and I was hestitant to read it because many people made it seem boring. When I finally picked it up and decided to read a page, I was hooked!<br />Bridget has spunk and wits more than anyone I've known. Her diary begins the day her weirdo mom invites her to a New Year's bash at the neighbors house, and she's forced to go. Life doesn't get easier for the British punk girl, as she faces her the fact that her mother has become a chat-show hostess. Bridget lives her life, makes mistakes, makes someone happy, and you begin to feel that she is real, only to be disapointed by remembering she is a fictional character.<br />Bridget's character and problems in life is what pulls you in the book. I think, that if the main character in a book isn't enjoyable from the start, there is no point to reading it. Bridget Jones' Diary is an extremely good read for teens. I must end this now- going to begin sequel!	2002-07-29

When I first picked up this book it seemed like a &quot;comedy&quot; book, but I was wrong. This book is an absolute page-turner that makes you really think.<br />A boy named Grayer really wants love, atention, and affection from his parents, but sadly he doesn't get any. Grayer trys to get it from the nannies his parents hire, but sooner or later, they are fired and replaced. It makes me sad to see someone like Grayer, although the story is fiction, there are many out there just like him, and that's what really upsets me. This story goes on to a surprise at the end, with a twist. <br />Hopefully not many kids can relate to Grayer, and I pray to God that no one ends up with parents like that! If you think I am overreacting, you must read this book at see what I mean. I highly recomend this book, it's so heartwarming and touching. I know I am going to be checking it out from my library again! have fun reading it!	2002-07-22

I know I am going to reread it over and over again. The plot is well developed and has only minor flaws. The main character, which is the author, Susanna Kaysen, gives to you her story, detailed and honest. It's basically about her problems and troubles dealing with mentail hospitals. She enters a hospital called &quot;McLean Hospital.&quot; She puts it in a very humorous way, showing the world what life is like inside the white walls of a hospital. She meets many people there, freinds and enemies, and deals with new experiences.<br />Susanna Kaysen is a very brave person to print millions of copies of her own experiences. She is a highly educated and should write more books! I highly recomend this over the movie, although the movie isn't bad...This book should be read by everyone, and should gain as much popularity as &quot;Go Ask Alice..&quot; Girl, Interrupted is easily a favorite for me, and after you read it, you'll love it!

This is her first novel, so there are some minor flaws but it doesn't take away from the quality of this book. Basically, this story is about Risika, a 300 year old vampire who struggles battles between human manners/morals and vampire ways. Soon, as the story continues you meet Aubrey, an even older vampire, who threatens Risika and her tiger Tora. The story has a alternating sequence from 1701 to the present.

Summer Sisters is truly one in which I am going to go back to, and reread alot. In this book, Vix and Caitlin meet at a young age. Caitlin invited Vix to spend the summer with her and her rich family, and it turns out she would be spending more than one summer! I really liked the relationhip with Vix and Bru, that's probably why I liked the book so much. I didn't really like the side-characters that much, because they weren't in the plot too much and had bad development as the story proceeded.<br />Summer Sisters is a great read for teens and adults. I don't know why Judy decided this to be an adult book...it fits better decribition as a teen book. I highly recomend this to anyone that's mature, because there is some sexual content. This is an awesome read and I know you'll be rereading too!...	2002-07-10

Her only problem is, she isn't maturing as quickly as her friends...and she wants to catch up. To sum it up in about a sentence : It's Margaret experiencing changes going on in her life, and her body. I wouldn't recomend this to someone younger than 5th...it's pretty pointless to them. Maybe to a middle schooler. I do recomend it think it's good for girls. Judy Blume's books are well-written, but now, I am beggining to enjoy her adult books.

This book is a book that'll have you at the edge of your seat. Let's give this author some MAJOR credit. She wrote her first book at my age! Age 13!! Other books you should read by this amazing author : In the Forest of the Night, Shattered Mirror, and Night Predator. READ ALL HER BOOKS!	2002-07-04

I'm not saying this book is bad, it's really interesting, and the girl deals with sexual abuse by her teacher, an unusual topic. But oviously Dr. Sparks edited this diary alittle TOO much, come on...even one of the best writers don't write that good! It makes the diary seem fake...but the important thing it, the story-line is still the same...this truly is someone's diary, except reworded. That is what interests me in Spark's edited diaries by anonymous. Read this one, you won't be able to put it down...very very haunting and reality isn't always easy!	2002-07-01

Ok, first of all...the people who make bad comments of about this book, and the people who are being sexist, better back off. Also, the people who are making rude comments about the author better check themselves b/c if this was such as bad book why is there over 600 good reviews for this book huh? And why did this book recieve over ten awards? Answer me that! <BR>       Basically, this is a book about a girl named Ella. Since birth she was cursed to obey all her commands ( sure it gets annoyinghow she cant say NO, but thats just the way it is..) She falls in love with the handsome Prince Char, but before she can marry him, she must find Lucinda and end the curse...I HIGHLY recoment this book to anybody, any age...Lemme just say ages 7-100..haha.

The plot was very weak and I kept waiting for something to happen, and knowing that it couldn't just end that way. \\"Charlie\\" is really annoying, and the author is trying to make it seem as if he is writing and sending the letters to the reader, but the whole thing really isn't working.

I love Caroline's writing, but this one was lacking her excitement, and the passion of wanting to continue and find out the ending. I found I was forcing myself to continue. Although this book isnt as bad as I'm portraying. It has a good storyline, and the characters are really realistic. I like all the books by Cooney, but this one isnt compared to any I've read. If you want a good one by her, check out Flight #116 is down. This is really scary and interesting, makes you feel as if it really happened!

It lacks the speciatly. Some of this book [made me mad], b/c the characters just zoom in and then zoom out of the story. I like the friendship between Violet and Claire, but in the beggining it only seemed that Vilet was Claire's friend because she needed someone for her movie. The ending of the book was ok, it never tells you if Violet & Claire become famous or not, so it just leaves you hanging. But now to the good part. The friendship between them is really great, and is what made me wanna finish it. Also the scenarios, with Peter, or Poetry teacher was really interesting. If you are a Block fan, this book is for you....(but it is not her best)	2002-06-20

I am Block fan, and Echo being my first block book, followed by I was a teenage fairy, I didnt find this book as well written. It cuts off major details and I finished it in about an hour. The book ends too fast, and they leave you guessing about her boyfriend Jack, and her other friend (cant remember name)...I think it should have been atleaset 30 pages longer. I found myself thinking that this girl is crazy for not eating. Its more \\"Dark\\" then Block's other books, but it was overall good.<BR>         I reccomend this book to Block fans, and fans of dark books. I was going to stop in the middle of this book b/c it got quite boring, but i finished it for the sake of finishing it! I am glad i finished it. And being a 13 year old, I know what I like.

Will she stay true to herself?<br />I think this is definetly a raed for all ages, and is a good \\"light read..\\" if you want to put it like that. I am not a big fan of Jerry Speneli, but this book was probably his best in my opinion.
