But since I gave only two stars, there must be some criticism: the description of the various characters is extreamly different, Strickland seems to be of an unreal cruelty, much too strong expression of  only one part of his character while the rest is left untold. Instead the characters of some other characters (e.g. the women ) aren't reported sufficently, only superficially. And then, another thing I was missing, is Maugham's  lack of  knowledge of real culture, or at least the lack of the influence from the Tahitian customs and live style (which is quite different from the English) on Strickland's life.  The novel concentrates too much on Strickland's problems and thoughts till it's almost unbearable.	2001-07-02

Strickland seems inhuman, nevertheless he can be a model for everybody  even today because he does what he wants - he just goes his way straight in his later years and he doesn't care about other people's opinions. I can't accept some statements made by the author about women though. Probably Maugham wants to provoke or to make people think about them, but I think that's not the right way to do it. I liked Maugh's style of narration because he mostly uses simple sentences, which often contain a lot of interesting ideas. Maugham writes a lot of dialogues, and they aren't superficial. On the contrary, they are very unusual because of the Strickland's way of always speaking his mind even if it hurts people around him.	2001-07-02

When we decided to read this novel in class, and we were told that it was inspired by the life of Gauguin I was a bit prejudiced against it, because I didn't like most of the pictures that Gaugin had painted. On the other hand I liked  Somerset Maugham's style of writing So it was a bit a &quot;to-and-fro&quot; for me at the beginning. The 4 stars I gave the story make clear that Maugham  has &quot;won&quot;. In fact the story is inspired by Gauguin, there are parallels, but it's not the real story of Gauguin's life anyway Maugham's descriptions are absolutely convincing, and the end of the novel is... just great! I mean, a man who tells the others before what a great time he had at the front then quotes the Bible, which is so conrary to the main message of the book, which is NOT revenge: Do what you are called to do, live your life according to your inner voice, don't care about society and what people might say and think about your work of art whatever that may be. One piece of advice: I recommend to every reader to study the Maugham biography while reading the novel. You will discover a lot of parallels, similarities and projections (e.g. between Maugham and Strickland).	2001-07-02

His descriptions about women are absolutely disgusting, and his pigeon-holing them into mother figures or bad women I think, is really too shallow, onesided and crude. Another thing is that this book for me is again a story about a suffering, inhuman person, who  wants to live only for art's sake. I think there are  too many  stories about that same topic,which are recommended by so many so-called well educated readers. Or it's possible that I had to read too much about almost the same topic in the last few years so that  I would have given more stars to that book if I had read it some time ago.  A good thing is that the story has various settings  like  London, Paris, Tahiti, which make it interesting, above all the scenes on Tahiti.	2001-07-02

In fact his main character, Charles Strickland, is exactly like Maugham would like to be because he sacrifies everyone and everything just to follow his inner vision, which is to paint. He doesnt care about society  he doesnt care about material things, he just lives for ideas and is indifferent to everything else. Thats according to some philosophers, the true and only way to be an artist and I think that it is also Maugham's opinion about it. Therefore he created a figure who is nothing  but his ideal picture of himself, as he did not have the courage and the force to live it in reality, probably due to his constant fear of losing all social relations. It's a really good book which could give you, the reader, the force to realize yourself  and to do only what you really like and give up everything else to reach your aim.	2001-07-02

Maugham  is one of the best describers of situations, characters and environments. That makes the novel interesting but sometimes hard to read. Even the speciality of the characters doesn't really help the reader to feel with Maugham's main figures. What Maugham is well known for  is the fact  that he always makes the personalities in his novels experience a crisis in their lives and that has drastic consequences for their customary life style. In particaular that means that the evil and despicable characters are changed into good ones at the end or vice versa. The main topic of this novel is Strickland's obsession with art. Nothing but art really counts in his life. He doesn't care about anyone and anything, not even about his personal life and death. And that's also what Maugham wants to tell us: follow your path and don't let yourself be  irritated by anything and anybody. If you have a bit of time to spare I can only recommend this novel.	2001-07-02

It is for once not the story of a detective finding a murderer or several murderers, but of two people, their characteristics, and how they commit a murder one for each other. The interesting thing about it is, that one of them, Bruno, really wants these murders done and doesn't know anything like remorse or so, and that the other one, Guy, almost gets crazy because his conscience tortures him after committing the murder, a deed done against his actual will. I found very interesting how the story was made up, how the influence of Bruno on Guy develops, gets bigger so that in the end Guy is in a conflict between fear/ fascination of Bruno and his own strong moral ideas and finally murders. The dynamic that comes up between those two people is a very interesting thing, and the story lives by that which makes it very captivating.	2001-06-22

It was exciting to start reading a new book, a new story that  may open a new horrizen to me. Who knows? Pretty soon, I soon got bored,  was not that curious about what was going to happen. Laura will always be  the shy girl, the girl, that has no self-esteem, no self-confidence. Laura  is different, sure. Her thoughts always turn around her glass menagerie,  the collection of little glass figureens. Amanda (Laura's mother) is the  one that has the total control of laura. only that fact makes her to a kind  of tyrann. she constantely talks about her youth, about how beautiful she  was, tells again and again how many gentlemen-callers she had. by the time  you read to the middle of the book, you are bored by that lady.  Tom  (Laura's brother) on the other hand is an interesting character. hH is just  trying to figure out what he actually want, what he and others stand for.  It is amazing to see his change from the beginning of the play to the  end.

I don't like the  hysterical character of Amanda. I don't understand how she treats her  children. Anywhere I've read that she treats her children like this because  she loves and needs them.

Tom Ripley gets the opportunity to travel to Europe for free. His contribution to his so called job is to persuade the son of Mr Greenleaf, a rich industrial, to come back  to the States to work in his father`s business and to see his mother who is  very ill. After finding Dickie Greenleaf and his female friend Marge, an  american writer, in a small village near Naples, Italy, called Mongibello,  he soon becomes a true admirer of the good looking and laid-back Dickie,  who leads a life full of amusement and pleasure. Soon the reader discovers  many talents in Tom Ripley, e.g. his extraordinary capability of observing  and imitating other people. Not before long Dickie finds Tom in his room  dressed in Dickie`s best suit. That`s the point when Dickie`s confidence in  Tom takes a U-turn and Marge developpes the theory of Tom beeing a queer  fellow. The relationship between Marge and Dickie becomes more and more  profound, which makes Tom feels alienated and jealous.  It would take me  too much time to resume the whole story here, so I`ll just give my personal  opinion: I think P. Highsmith really succeeded in opening a very complex  character to the reader just by telling him about this character`s thoughts  and feeling and his crimes off course. Reading the novell I somethimes  caught myself feeling pity or even sympathy for a murderer, a rude and  brutal murderer who kills of a rather surprising motivation: he kills  people because he loves and adores them, he wants to be as close as  possible to them. In fact he kills to be somebody. because before killing  Dickie he is a real nobody!	2000-06-14

Tom changed his identity, but he never  lost the identity of Tom. He had to &quot;jump&quot; from one to the other  persons, and he was very talented in doing that. Patricia Highsmith didn't  forget a single detail in this game of lies and imitations.

Reading the book was very strenuous because we could not get involved in the story a  long time. It seemed you couldn't step ahead reading. There are several  sub-actions that seem very long sometimes because of the amount of the  details; the main action is hesitated. The author describes the characters  very detailed, their feelings and thoughts are shown. The reader can feel  that tension in the book appears several times, i.e. Tom Ripley takes the  identity of his admired friend Dickie and gets confronted with Marge and  Fausto, who know that he isn't the person he pretends to be, so the  situation becomes very dangerous. Ripley's character is almost  indescribable: He appears as a friend and a gentleman at the beginning, but  during the story you can see that he is very egostic and cruel, if the  situation forces him to act a cruel way. He is very genius in his role,  that means he can handle situations very cool and smart, and if it was good  luck he always acts the right way, so nobody notices what's going on.  Sometimes the reader has to reflect and make a stop to be able to  understand the development. It is very hard, because Ripley changes his  identity several times, that's perhaps why the story becomes so complex at  times. I dare say his character is schizophrenic and almost like a  parasite. He lives an easy life in Italy grace of the money of Mr.  Greenleaf and he even reaches to destroy the developing relationship of  Dickie and Marge.	2000-06-07

Already from the first page there is a certain tension that never disappears again.  The most fascinating or rather frightening fact is that  you really can identify with a murderer. This is because of the very  exactly description of Tom Ripley, his behaviour, thoughts and feelings.  Therefore he gets a very honest character at the beginning and you also  feel pity for him (i.g. the way he passed his childhood). After the first  murder it's almost impossible for the reader to hate him and so in a way  you are guilty, too, `cause you're sympathising with a killer.

The topics he writes about are problems nowadays, especially this brain thing in William &amp; Mary. But the end is disappointing and his morbid  humour disgusting. <br />William &amp; Mary: an understandable, topical,  fairly realistic story. The end is less unexpected than it is in the other  stories. The argument can be followed. The characters are not really fixed,  one has to build his own opinion, because both, William and Mary, are in  their own ways enjoyable. Their actions are comprehensible. The end is  somewhat too hard for William, he's not as bad as Mary thinks and he hasn't  earned such a treating. It was the best story.<br />The wish: a relatively  realistic story, too, but totally exaggerated and stupid. You always expect  more than there is in the end.<br />Pig: Beginning okay, but the longer it  lasts the more stupid it becomes, the end is too cruel, unrealistic and  simply macabre. <br />In general we think that these are no stories for  children.

I found the stories in &quot;Three Tales of the Unexpected&quot; in a way interesting. I saw what the intention of Roald Dahl was, which means I found the morbid humour in the stories. Nevertheless I missed something in  the stories. I cannot really say what exactly it was, I think it was not  tension which the stories lacked, but I found no full sense in the stories.  I must say that I liked &quot;William and Mary&quot; very much, and that  its sense was quite clear to me. The idea of Mary having the power over her  husband, being in fact only a piece of meat respectively brain. I didn't  dislike the stories, but as I said I am not sooooo delighted by them.  Anyway, I think i should find out something more about the circumstances  that Roald Dahl lived in, and what made him write the stories the way he  did. Moreover I think I should read one of his longer books like &quot;The  Gremlins&quot;...  <br />I rather play Ninetendo. I didn't like three tales of  the unexpected,  not one of the stories. Well, the second was the best even  though it wasn't very thrilling. Everybody knows and has, as a child, done  games like this one. The others were very absurd and senseless and that's  why I didn't like them at all.  I can't explain exacly why but I don't like  Dahl's writing style. Reading this book is an absolutely waste of time so  you'd rather read a book of John Irving (&quot;The Water-Method Man&quot;  is absolutely genial) or play with your nintendo.	2000-05-11

Like he does! All of the three stories have a foolish and  pessimistic end, which you would never expect. The first story tells about  a couple, where the husband died. He wanted to live on and so he followed  the instructions of the doctor and allowed, that the surgeon takes out his  brain of his head as soon as  he died. The joke about this story is, that  his wife who was always against this idea and she  wanted at the end even  take the brain home. And Dahl uses so many medical expressions, that you  nearly fall asleep by reading it. The second story we don't even remember,  what it was  about!   The third story is even more macabre than the first one and we would never  recommend it to people who are still a little bit normal! <br />Olivia &amp;  Fabienne         <br />If you want to tell us your opinion write to:  bianco@mails.ch	2000-05-11

The story was very predictable, especially when you read (like me) first the last sentence of the book. I have to mention that I didn't like the end because it was too clear for me.  I like endings where you have to imagine yourself what's going to happen  now, but in &quot;lies of silence&quot; there is nothing what is worth to  imagine. The minds of the characters aren't well shown. You get to know  them only superficially and that's a great pitty.

It doesn't extenuate the contemporary situation: The Catholics and the Protestants, both of them are extremely  narrow minded. Unfortunately they can't deal without weapons, there are no  compromises. Moore doesn't want to describe the natural landscape, but he  tells a story (that might be true and that contains many of the actual  issues in Ireland) in a very thrilling way. He also talks about love and  marriage which were important to him in his life. I could identify myself  with the different persons and characters in this masterpiece and I'm sure  that you'll feel and understand the uncertainty that rules Ireland after  you read this great book. But to get the maximum rating, the book lacks  particularity, it's too common. georgesschmid@hotmail.com	2000-03-02

Beneath this they have their own problems in  their relationship. I think Brian Moore showed this quite well. More and  more the personal problems are left, or better mixed up with political  moral questions (well, first moral questions are found at the beginning  already). Questions must be asked, for example about going back to Ireland  and testify about the kidnapping (it's a question about priorities,  &quot;shall I put us in danger and help a little to solve the problems of  northern Ireland or shan't I?&quot;). I find the story really well done,  but I missed a bit the tension in it. Markus	2000-03-02

His goal is it to  be well-like and to have lots of people coming to his funeral. He's hard  working his whole life but still doesn't get this good reputation. he wants  his two sons to be well-liked and well-know also. also the mother, who  seems not to have a back role in the play, is pretty important because she  is the one who tries to be real and see things how they are. but she tries  to cheer people up, thus she wants her family to be happy. she wants  everybody to get along in the family while her husband doesn't really care  what's happening in the family itself but he wants other people to have  good thoughts about his family.	2000-01-17

She reads a lot of books and with the help of her professor Frank she is also able to understand them. She becomes  independent, she leaves her husband and changes her life completely. At the  end she doesn't need her teacher any longer and they go separate ways. The  tragic point of the play is that Rita can't really improve her life inspite  of all education. She can't go back to her former life, but she hasn't  a  new one yet. Frank is going to Australia, after loosing his job, because he  is an alcoholic.<br />The play is interesting, but there are a lot of authors  mentioned who make the whole text a bit difficult to read. It has been  written in dialogues and threw the whole play there are only Rita and Frank  talking to each other. We can recommend the book.<br />(two students) Aarau,  Switzerland	2000-01-17

But I admire the variety of the vocabulary that Shaffer made use of. He handled a couple of topics, which are very  interesting: I.e. the existence of god, different cultures and their  organisation, religion and a motive that goes through the whole story: The  word. Shaffer encourages the reader to make his own opinion about questions  like: «Is it justified to break the word if you act in consciousness and  for the good of your crew?»<br />Pizarro's problem as an illegitimate son and  his existential questions are not discussed. Something that makes this play  very special is the fact that Old Martin occurs time after time and tells  about his experiences and the happenings, when he had been in Peru.<br />In  short: + Interesting play with a demanding vocabulary   - Hard to get  in	2000-01-17

Thornton Wilder is expressing the  athmosphere in this town with humor and warmth. He wants to tell us, that  there's no need in looking back. You should always look forward into the  future.  The mean idea of the play is the question about eternal life.  Wilder is explaining this question in the third act.	2000-01-17

But the point is that they don't really talk about old times. Everyone tells things that happened in the past and no one knows if they are true. Those things have no  context. They are a lot of sexual  hints by Deeley. Also strange is that  Deeley didn't tell his wife that he already knows Anna. We don't recommend  this book because we didn't understand well the sense of the story. In this  story you have to read between the lines, and it could happen that even  then you are not able to understand the play.	2000-01-17

The Fathers keep doing their job because of a vocation by God and not for the sake of the lepers. Querry first doesn't have any motives  until he feels needed by the lepers. He acts out of his empathy which he  found again in Africa. That's the reason why he's much more honest compared  to the Fathers who want to satisfy themselves by helping there. This fact  shouldn't be the motive of Christian Love. Without the aim of becoming  Christian, he developed Christian characteristics. Graham Greene might have  used this plot to criticise those who are sure of their Christian behaviour  towards God and the society.	2000-01-12

But its not only the line of time and the characters that are fascinating:  London at the time of war is the perfect place for the story of a love  affair the author has presumingly not just imagined. Thus, the plot is very  lively. The often occuring philosophical thoughts aren't just ornaments,  they were a real input for me to discuss again our world and aspects like  the possible existence of a higher being.	2000-01-12
