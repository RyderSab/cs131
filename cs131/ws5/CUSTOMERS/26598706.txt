She is now 16 and has been sent back to England to stay with her aunt and cousins. On the journey there, she becomes engaged to Hugo Rothschild, the ninth earl of Malfrey. The young captain, Jacob Carstairs, has been annoying Victoria the whole trip, and now that they're in England, he's been trying to break up her engagement, telling her that Hugo is a rogue and isnt an honerable man. She doesnt listen to him because why should she listen to someone who is such an \\"insufferable man\\" who has very un-stylishly low collar points. Despite her hatrid for Jacob, she starts to fall for him and once she finds out the truth about Hugo, she has to do something about it and give in to her stubborn feelings and admit to herself what she really wants. This book is really good and so are Meg Cabot's other books, so i would reccomend reading them all!	2005-07-07

Im sure you know what it is about but im going to summariize it anyways. The Montague and Capalet families have been enemies for generations. The current generations dont exactly know why, but they still stay enimies with each other. Romeo Montague finds out about a party hosted by the Capulet's (Juliet's family) and he intends to go there to see a girl, Juliet's cousin. Since the party is a costume party, he manages to get in without anyone knowing he is a Montague. Juliet's parents have found a suitor for her, Count Paris. They make a deal with her that at the party, she will look at him and see if she likes him but if she doesnt, they can't force her to marry him (when you read it the line about that is something like \\"i'll look to like if looking liking...\\"). While at the party she meets Romeo and they pretty much fall in love at first sight. She finds out he is a Montague and he finds out she is a Capulet so they keep their relationship secret. Meanwhile, they secretly get married and plan on telling their families, hoping it will bring them to a truce. But then Romeo does something that causes him to be banished from Verona and so he and Juliet come up with a plan for them to be together. You probably know that it doesnt work out and the ending is not a happy one. Thats why this is called a tragedy... Anyways, its actually pretty good, even though its hard to follow somethimes and is so old fashioned.	2005-07-07

I had to read this book in school and it was pretty good for an educational book. It had many adventures and exciting parts in it. It is about a woman named Scout who is in her thirties. She is narrarating her memories from when she was 6-10 years old. Some memories she talks about include how she and her brother Jem would always walk by the Radley house. They would sometimes find small presents in the knothole of the tree outside and they knew Boo (Arthur) Radley would come out a night to put them there. His brother Nathan wasn't supposed to let him out of the house and Boo had been locked up for the past 15 or so years (ever since he was 16). Another event that takes place is that Atticus, Scout and Jem's dad, is the lawyer representing a black man who has been accused of rape. Many people in the town are racist and don't think he should represent the case but he has to, to keep his moral value. This book takes place in the 1930's. The only reason why I didn't give this book five stars was that it isn't my type of genre, I don't really like historical fiction type stories, but other wise this book was very good!!	2005-02-12

I had to read this book for school and I thought it wouldn't be good because the title isn't that appealing to me but it was really good!!! It is about a boy named Matt and he is a clone of El Patron, a really important guy who is 143 years old and basically controls everyone. Most clones get their brains damaged so they aren't like normal people but Matt didn't so he is basically a normal kid but he was never allowed to go outside of his tiny cottage near the Alacran Mansion. One day, while Celia, his \\"mom\\" type person, is out working as a maid at the mansion, Matt sees the Alacran kids outside, so he breaks the window open and jumps outside to play with them. He cuts his bare foot on some of the glass so the kids take him to their house. Then Rosa, another maid, sees the tattoo on his foot that proves he is a clone and she locks him up. Throughout the book Matt learns more about clones and about how evil El Patron really is. Even though El P might seem nice to Matt in the beginning, he is just using Matt. If you want to know if Matt escapes from the prison Rosa put him in, why he wasn't brain damaged and why El Patron had a clone made (and how he lived to be 143)...then read this awesome book!! It is very exciting and the things that happen to Matt are really interesting. It's so good you won't want to put it down.	2005-02-12
