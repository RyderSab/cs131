While his own experience is mainly in fencing, he also incorporates the work of other sports photographers in his book, which according to the introduction, is aimed at every photographer except full time professional sports photographers.  The book is divided into four main parts. Understanding digital sports photography includes a general introduction, a section about workflow and a discussion of equipment and techniques.  Shooting sports on location groups the approach to different sports depending on their venue.  Working in the digital studio discusses the requirements for digital processing and processing techniques.  A section on presentation talks about everything from printing through earning money from your photographs to legal issues.<br /><br />I found the section on shooting sports on location the most useful.  For example you can turn to the chapter on indoor competition sports and find a number of hints that may prove useful in such a venue.<br /><br />Unfortunately, other parts of the book are less useful.  While the author is undoubtedly a good photographer, his organizational skills as a writer are weak.  He will repeat the same advice over and over.  For example on a single page he will ask \\"[W]hat if you inadvertently click the wrong setting and delete all the photos..?\\" and then a few sentences later say \\"Don't be in a hurry.  More than one photographer has deleted a card without meaning to....\\"<br /><br />He often gives wrong advice.  For example, he states that you cannot upgrade from Photoshop Elements to the full blown Photoshop.  Yet for some time now, and as of the date of this writing, Adobe has given a $100 discount to Photoshop Elements owners on the purchase of Photoshop.  He also gives contradictory advice.  On one page he recommends establishing a digital darkroom with \\"a good-quality monitor, preferably the CRT kind, not an LCD display.\\"  A few pages later he says \\"a good quality LCD will be perfectly sufficient.\\"<br /><br />His discussion of digital processing could have been limited to a discussion of some of the possibilities of Photoshop.  Instead he provides just enough instruction to confuse any would-be user.<br /><br />But the biggest problem is that he leaves out the discussion of factors that are important to new digital photographers.  For example, one of the tools that separates film from digital in the control of exposure is the in-camera histogram.  Yet there is no mention of the facility until the chapter on darkroom processing and then it is given short shrift.<br /><br />For another example, digital cameras shoot in various formats like Raw and JPEG, which is not as flexible for post-processing as Raw but creates smaller picture files.  Digital cameras store picture files in a buffer before they write the data to a memory card.  When the buffer is full, the camera will not take a photograph.  For this reason sports photographers, who often shoot in long bursts, prefer JPEG so that they can store more pictures in the buffer.  Timacheff does not even suggest that this might be a reason for selecting JPEG over Raw.<br /><br />If you purchase this book for the tips on shooting in sports locations, you may find it useful.  Otherwise, you will probably be disappointed.ality LCD will be perfectly sufficient.\\"    His discussion of digital processing could have been limited to a discussion of some of the possibilities of Photoshop.

Get the full range of light, from the blackest blacks to the clearest whites.  Adams also helped establish the rules to achieve that goal.  Control the process every inch of the way, from picking your equipment until the final print, to capture your vision.<br /><br />The modern digital photographer can achieve that control by using all the features of his camera and the software available to him for processing.  The leading software is Adobe Photoshop.  Manufacturers have adopted a format called Raw that captures the most data so that the photographer can exercise the most control in processing.  Adobe has responded with Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) which helps photographers squeeze that data from the file to allow digital photographers to meet the Adams standard.<br /><br />Rob Sheppard has produced a book on using ACR that always keeps in mind that the purpose of ACR is to help the photographer produce an image that embodies his vision.  There are several books available about using ACR that describe how to use the sliders and what the effects are.  Sheppard's book covers the same ground, but he also relates the technique to the artistic purpose.  For example, he tells you how the shadows slider works to change the black point in a picture.  But he tells you that you should not just extend it to some arbitrary limit that insures the image has the greatest range.  He discusses the fact that varying the black point helps to give snap to some pictures and that increasing areas with no shadow detail may actually help to achieve the photographer's vision.<br /><br />The author recognizes that the process begins with taking the image and, after a discussion of the Raw format itself, tells you how to use the in-camera histogram that comes with many higher end cameras, to bring the best possible image to ACR.  Then he selects a number of specific images, with a full range of differing processing requirements, to illustrate the use of the ACR tools to achieve the photograph that reflects the photographer's vision.  The book is profusely illustrated with step by step images that remove any doubt one might have about what to do.  And thankfully, for my eyes, the illustrations were large enough to see clearly without a magnifying glass.<br /><br />I particularly liked the chapter \\"The Noise Problem No One Talks About\\" which was a problem that I've never been able to find enough help in solving.  There was also a chapter on compact digital camera Raw processing which recognized that not all photographers are shooting digital single lens reflex cameras.<br /><br />Sheppard recognizes that sometimes even ACR cannot capture all the data available in a single conversion and includes a chapter on combining separately adjusted files of the same image in Photoshop to extend range even more.  He includes a chapter discussing other Raw converters that are available.<br /><br />This book is aimed at slightly more experienced photographers then another favorite of mine, \\"Raw 101\\" by Jon Canfield.  Moreover, it doesn't cover the post ACR process in Photoshop, for which I would recommend Tim Grey's \\"Photoshop CS2 Workflow\\".  Finally, there is no hands-on work here.  If you learn better that way, you may want to read Barry Haynes' \\"Photoshop CS Artistry\\", which includes extensive tutorials, although at least in prior versions, gave ACR short shrift.<br /><br />For me, Sheppard's book seemed the perfect explanation of ACR.ffering processing requirements, to illustrate the use of the ACR tools to achieve the photograph that reflects the photographer's vision.

It covers all of the bases that one would expect and hope for.  The author particularly emphasizes the use of digital equipment in getting pictures of animals.  For example in his discussion of exposure, he explains the use of histograms (a graph showing the distribution of light values) and the highlights screen (an optional screen on a digital camera's LCD display that blinks in areas of the picture that are overexposed.)  Although this is one of the features of advanced digital cameras that makes digital exposures easier, it is rarely explained in any detail in many of the books that purport to discuss digital photography.<br /><br />The book starts out with the usual basic equipment discussion but as one reads through the book other equipment which will prove useful to the wildlife photographer is introduced.  The book progresses from simple photography, through composition, to more complex techniques, like the use of flash and action photography.  The final chapter of the book is devoted to digital post processing with a discussion of simple Photoshop techniques, like setting levels and cropping.  Sprinkled throughout the book are \\"Wild Files\\" where the author deals with specific animal species, like the lion, discussing where and when to photograph the animal, the shots to look out for and any special equipment needed.<br /><br />I have said that the book is a useful introduction.  It is, however, also a rather light once over that covers all the essential points, but doesn't go into the depth an experienced wildlife photographer might need.  After reading this book, the new wildlife photographer will soon want to go on to other books with more depth like the late Bill Silliker's \\"Master Guide for Wildlife Photographers\\" or Moose Peterson's \\"Guide to Wildlife Photography\\".  Those expecting to spend any time in the digital darkroom will want to read Ellen Anon and Tim Grey's \\"Photoshop for Nature Photographers\\".<br /><br />I should also warn new wildlife photographers to be careful in looking at Weston's pictures.  It's obvious, from reading the technical data on many of the pictures that the photographer was extremely close to the animal when the picture was taken.  As they say, don't try this at home!  While the captions do not identify when the pictures were taken in controlled situations (as recommended by the North American Nature Photographers Association), it seemed clear to me that many were.  (In fact I'm sure I recognized a badger I had photographed at the Triple D Game Farm.)  There's nothing wrong with this, since that may be the only way to get the shot needed, but readers and photographers should be aware that they should not endanger either themselves or wildlife just to get a picture.shop for Nature Photographers\\". <br /> <br />I should also warn new wildlife photographers to be careful in looking at Weston's pictures.

Unfortunately, the feature by feature presentation doesn't do much to show you how to use the camera to take good pictures.  This book aims at that target for the Nikon D70 digital camera.<br /><br />The book provides a quick start up guide and then a more detailed list of the D70's features that is something like the presentation in the manual, i.e., descriptive without being too functional unless you know what you want to achieve.  But once the introduction is over, there is information on photography basics like exposure, depth of field, the use of artificial light, focusing modes and lens selection.<br /><br />The second half of the book discusses photo subjects, like architectural photography, flower and plant photography, and street life photography.  Each of these sections offers some general ideas on the subject and presents a picture taken by the author.  The author discusses his consideration of setup, lighting, lens, etc. in taking the picture.<br /><br />This book aims at people who are converting from a point-and-shoot camera to a D70, and I suppose it may do as an introductory text.  But no one should think that this book is going to make him or her a very competent digital photographer.  This is because the discussion of the D70's features is superficial at best.  For example the discussion of focusing indicates there are two autofocus modes, single servo and continuous servo, but never really explains when the photographer might select one over the other.<br /><br />Similarly when the author describes the menu preferences, he never really tells you when each of the preferences might be useful.  Moreover, he doesn't even discuss some of the critical menu items.  While the D70 is not Nikon's most expensive camera it still is not inexpensive.  Someone buying this camera will want to know how to get the most out of it.  For example, most serious digital camera users will probably want to use the raw format occasionally.  I expected a comparison of the raw format to the JPEG format.  There was none.  I also expected some discussion of the settings for sharpness, color mode, and similar settings available under the \\"optimize image\\" setting.  Again there was none.<br /><br />Occasionally I was confused by references by the author like \\"Adobe Elements 4.0\\".  Busch is way ahead of Adobe on this one, since they are only selling Elements 3.0<br /><br />If you are one of those photographers making the transition from a point and shoot camera to a D70, the book may help you ease the transition.  But to really use the capabilities of this camera you will have to do a lot of other research.most serious digital camera users will probably want to use the raw format occasionally.

Using the techniques of the tool, \\"Photoshop for Nature Photographers\\" covers the digital photography process from the moment of setting the defaults in a digital camera to the final production of a digital output, whether to a printer or a monitor.  It presents basic concepts that will prove useful to the digital beginner, but also includes tips that may be new to the experienced Photoshop user.  It also provides an excellent refresher to the individual upgrading from an earlier version of Photoshop to Photoshop CS2.  Although the examples are drawn from nature photography, the book should be of use to all digital photographers.<br /><br />It spends its earliest pages discussing some fundamental concepts applicable to the time of capture that will effect the ultimate product, like RAW versus JPEG, white balance and histograms.  Because Photoshop offers a number of setup preferences that will effect the use of the software, the authors recommend particular selections.  They then explain the basic tools of Photoshop, like Adobe Bridge (although strangely there is no mention of using Bridge to import files from your memory card to your computer), Camera Raw and cropping and move on to exposure and color adjustments.  All of this is easily understandable and can help the new user learn how to process digital images and can suggest ways to improve the workflow of the more experienced user.<br /><br />The experienced user will probably find something useful in the chapter on composites where the authors discuss how to create panoramas, expanding dynamic range and depth of field and combining elements from several pictures.  It was here that I discovered several techniques, like a \\"cookbook\\" approach to expanding latitude that I had never encountered before.<br /><br />The end of the book includes a discussion of creative techniques like montage, outputs and the Photoshop facilities for mass processing: actions and batch processing.<br /><br />The workbook aspect of the text takes the form of a CD full of images that are specially selected to let the user practice a technique.  While a photographer could use his own images as well, taking the offered images and following the step by step procedure described by the authors will prove useful where the reader doesn't quite comprehend the process presented.<br /><br />Photoshop often offers several different approaches to manipulating a picture and occasionally the author's preferences vary and each presents his and her approach.<br /><br />Although the book was quite comprehensive, and indeed offered techniques I had never encountered before, it was not all encompassing.  As an example Grey, in another book, \\"Color Confidence\\" provides a method of setting target black and white values, to ensure that shadow details can be seen.  He has not included the procedure in this book.<br /><br />If you want to learn to use Photoshop in a linear fashion, with understandable instruction, presented in a logical workflow, this is as fine a text as you will find.  On the other hand, if you like tutorials that start with a single image and develop that image using many tools and require you to actually manipulate the image, and then use other images the same way, to make different points, then I would recommend Barry Hanes \\"Photoshop Artistry\\" which is updated for each new version of Photoshop.<br /><br />If you know Photoshop, you probably will learn something new if you go through the book.

One part is a collection of Ward's landscape photographs.  The other is a philosophical examination of creativity and vision in landscape photography.  It is this series of essays that I find most intriguing.<br /><br />The author initially discusses the nature of photographs; that they are not real and that they capture time.  He suggest that while most landscape photographers are interested in the grand vistas, most might be better served by concentrating on the intimate landscape because there are more opportunities there for discovery.  He also suggest that one of the best procedures one can follow in landscape photography is to go slowly and delay taking the photograph as long as possible to let your vision crystallize.  Eventually the author takes a semiotic approach to landscape photography.  (Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols as means of communication.)  Ward notes the importance of realizing both the connotation and denotation of photographs as signs or symbols.  Along the way, Ward provides a history of landscape photography, with particular emphasis on developments relating to creativity and vision.<br /><br />One of the main problems of Ward's essays is that they never do reveal to us what the nature of photographic vision and creativity is.  That may be because this is something unknowable and ineffable.  Yet thinking around the edges of these profound ideas may help the photographer to develop them, and that makes this book worth reading.<br /><br />It's a sign of the difficulty of the subject that I often felt Ward had not made the right choices in the design of his book such as leaving the discussion of how we perceive things to the last rather then presenting it in the beginning of the book.<br /><br />Turning to Ward's pictures, which are scattered throughout the book, they are terrific.  They demonstrate a vision and beauty we could all emulate.  I have said elsewhere that editors feel that books of great pictures do not sell, and so they ask great photographers to write \\"how to\\" books.  That conclusion was too focused.  Books of great pictures do sell, provided that the pictures tell a story, or that there is a synergistic effect in the way that the pictures are presented.  But Ward seems to reject that approach.  Although quotes from the text appear alongside his pictures, the pictures do not illustrate the text, except in the broadest possible way.  And Ward refuses to provide technical data on his pictures, saying this is a \\"why book\\", not a \\"how to book\\".  He seems to be challenging the reader to construct his or her own book!<br /><br />The bottom line on this book is that there seems to be no silver bullet for creativity and vision.

After thinking about this book for some time, I think I can be fair.<br /><br />Engh's basic point is that a photographer who wants to make money with his photographs will sell from stock to markets that are not competitive.  He then tells the aspiring stock photographer how to determine what those markets are, how to find the photo buyers in those markets and how to deal with those buyers to get your stock photographs sold.  Although I'm not a stock photographer most of the steps he advises have a ring of truth to them and agree with what the stock photographers I know tell me.<br /><br />But if you are interested in \\"landscapes, birds, scenics, insects, plants, wildflowers, major pro sports, silhouettes, experimental photography, artistic subjects, (such as the \\"art\\" photography in photography magazines), abstracts (such as those seen in photo-art magazines and salons), popular travel spots, monuments, landmarks, historic sites, [and] cute animals\\" Engh says forget about them.  Well, maybe that's too strong.  He says when you put those areas on the back burner, \\"you'll stop wasting time, film, postage, and materials.\\"  When I came to this advice, I almost put the book down, because it was clear that Engh wasn't talking to me.  Most people take photographs because they are interested in some subject matter or approach and not just to make money.<br /><br />I also was disturbed by how often in the book the author shilled for his company and web-site, where, he says, useful information is available.  It may be, but it appears it's always for a price.<br /><br />In summary, if all you want to do is make money with your camera, without joy or pleasure, this book may be for you.	2005-08-21

The latter book was designed to help professional photographers with the business aspects of their careers (but I found it omitted reference to many important business questions).  I was wrong.<br /><br />This book purports to be aimed at people who are interested in becoming professional freelance photographers and it starts out simply in the first part with a broad overview, including comparisons of the advantages of attending a photography school and apprenticing to a professional photographer and selecting equipment.  It was simple stuff to be sure but I'm told many people entering the career need this type of information.<br /><br />But when Part II came, there was more meat.  It was a first for me to encounter a photography business book that actually talked about where the new professional was going to get his startup cash: family, friends, a working wife, or even (highly unlikely) a bank loan.  The short chapter on location and leases even referred to things like zoning and subletting.  There was even a section that talked about the collection of sales taxes and resale certificates for tax exemption.  The chapter on insurance covered a topic you never hear even experienced photographers talk about although you know they all need it.<br /><br />Part IV on negotiating contracts and prices even had a pricing model that looked at the costs of creating photographs and suggested that if the photographer could not set his prices high enough to cover his costs (including his own draw) he should not enter the business.<br /><br />Part V called \\"Photography and the Law\\" discussed copyright, privacy and hiring an attorney.  It even had a section on income taxes with suggestions on how to keep the books, which combined with an earlier reference to the software Quicken, talked about an issue that the new photographer usually doesn't even think about facing.<br /><br />You may have noted that I haven't discussed Part III on marketing, which I found the weakest part of the book.  It was disjointed and not comprehensive, although most photographers would probably benefit from reading the short but well written chapter called \\"The Web Site as Marketing Tool.\\"  If you want to understand what's involved in marketing I would suggest Scott Bourne's little book \\"88 Secrets to Selling & Publishing Your Photography.\\"<br /><br />This is not to suggest that this is the only business text a freelance photographer will ever need.  Far from it.  With the exception of the chapters on copyright and privacy and releases (which I think covered the fields very well) every one of the issues raised by the book will require more extensive study.  But the book will highlight areas of the business of photography of which the beginning freelancer would never think until a major problem exploded in his face.

That dichotomy is emphasized in the contents of this book.<br /><br />It's important to understand that \\"Photoshop CS2 Bible, Professional Edition\\" is not the same book as \\"Photoshop CS2 Bible\\".  And it's not just the hard cover.  This is a somewhat shorter book, with more color graphics and aimed at more experienced users of Photoshop than \\"Photoshop CS2 Bible\\", with emphasis on advanced techniques.<br /><br />The book is divided into chapters, each of which covers a group of related tools and functions, like painting and brushes; blend modes and knockouts; and pixelate, distort and render.  Each of the chapters goes into these functions in great detail, telling you how to use the function.  For example, in the chapter on shapes and styles, one section is devoted to the 8 steps of creating a new shape layer.  These explanations are accompanied by excellent color illustrations that show you the procedure.  The explanations themselves are clear and concise.  I had no trouble learning about the use of functions that I had never used before.<br /><br />The book appears to be aimed at the graphic artist rather than the photographer.  Even the design of the book itself, with lots of colorful illustrations, excellent typography and high-quality paper, seems to be aimed at graphic artists.  For example, the chapter on brushes spends time explaining the scattering option, which spreads the positions of spots of color around brush strokes.  I can't begin to picture when a photographer might apply such a sophisticated technique.  This level of explanation is found throughout the book.  On the other hand the book will not lead you through an entire process from creating a new image to saving it for printing.  Often it does not give a practical example of how a particular tool might be used.  It will be up to the graphic artist to figure that out.  This is not the book for someone to learn how to use Photoshop.<br /><br />Moreover, I found that what the authors consider advanced techniques was rather idiosyncratic.  For example, there is no discussion at all of the extraction tool, which the authors say is covered in the basic edition.  On the other hand, the discussion of quick mask seemed to me to be quite elementary.  The chapter on web graphics discussed the creation of animations but not rollovers.  The chapter on Adobe Camera Raw had a simplistic discussion of the use of the raw converter.  And there was not even a mention of Adobe Bridge's ability to be used to import images from cameras.<br /><br />Even though this book is well written and provides a great deal of information on some of the tools and processes hidden in Photoshop, it will probably appeal to a limited audience.

US	53044678	R1MHVMFD36XE06	0782144322	782684865	Raw 101: Better Images with Photoshop Elements  and Photoshop	Books	5	51	54	N	N	A Simple, Straightforward Explanation	More and more advanced digital cameras offer a number of file formats for capturing the digital image, including JPG, TIF and RAW.  None of these formats, because of the limitations of the camera mechanism, captures as much information about the scene being photographed as the human eye.  For example, a photograph that shows detail in bright light will usually show less detail in shadows than the human eye would see.  Some of these file formats actually delete some of the data.  Serious photographers agree that the RAW format captures the most data from the scene.<br /><br />When the Adobe Company first came out with Adobe Camera Raw (ACR), the software aimed at extracting the maximum data from the RAW file, there was little information about how to use it.  But since Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, which are the most widely used digital imaging programs, both include ACR as part of the package, the knowledge base has continued to increase.<br /><br />\\"Camera Raw 101\\" is a manual, aimed at the relatively inexperienced ACR user, that covers its use in both Photoshop CS2 (the current version of Photoshop) and Photoshop Elements 3 (the reduced capability, but much cheaper version of Photoshop.).  After describing the techniques for getting images from the camera to the computer, Canfield describes each of the functions offered in ACR and then tells how to use those functions to get pictures that contain as much information in possible.  He finishes up by summarizing the steps that should be taken in Photoshop and Elements after RAW processing.  His instructions are simple, clear and easy to follow.<br /><br />ACR includes several functions that are also available in the main body of Photoshop and Elements.  Canfield believes there are functions to usually apply in ACR and others after ACR conversion, but also describes situations where one might process in the opposite fashion.<br /><br />This is by no means a description of the entire process of moving a picture from camera to print.  The emphasis is on the use of ACR.  The book's publisher, Sybex, offers several other books that focus on other aspects of image processing like \\"Photoshop CS2 Workflow\\" by Tim Grey and \\"Photo Finish\\" by Canfield and Grey.<br /><br />Although the book is aimed at ACR novices, experienced users may still find information about the capability of ACR with which they were not acquainted.  I know I did.  At the very least, it would provide a useful review of the process.<br /><br />This book will appeal to those who learn best by lecture.  Photographers who like tutorials might want to consider the \\"Photoshop Artistry\\" series by Barry Haynes.<br /><br />I have one complaint about the book.  Many of the illustrations are screen grabs from the computer monitor.  Unfortunately they are printed so that the size of the image itself is only about 2 and one-half inches square.  In the illustrations of digital noise I was unable to see the noise pattern, even with the use of a magnifying glass.<br /><br />In summary, this is excellent instruction in the use of ACR.

It is so obviously well intentioned and aims at filling a real need.  After all, digital media does offer tools to landscape and other photographers and has limitations that film doesn't have.<br /><br />Moreover, the publishers, in this and other books in their photography series, have come up with a different approach to teaching photography.  The usual approach has been to have a narrative about some aspect of photography and then to provide examples, with each part building on the material previously presented.  The AVA books instead start with a picture and then try to show the decisions and processes that the photographer used to get the final product.  But they've gone even further imposing a strict graphic format for each subject.  They start with a relevant quotation from the photographer.  Then across a two-page spread, that includes the photograph, they give general tips, Down the left hand of the spread a flow chart of the photographer's actions is provided from capturing the image to creating an ink jet print.  The author divides the brief discussion of the picture into three sections entitled shoot, enhance and enjoy.<br /><br />The problem for me was that the digital process was not developed coherently.  Rather, the entire process was set forth again and again and again.  But as it was set forth it never described the steps taken in anything but the most general way.  If one is an advanced photographer and already knows what is involved, the picture and spread might serve as an idea book.  But if that was the author's purpose, it might have helped to discuss where the photographer's ideas came from.<br /><br />In addition, many of the pictures were composites or involved extreme manipulation of the image, such as by twisting it around.  My guess is that the average landscape photographer is not interested in surrealism but wants to know how he can make a picture that he took look more like what he envisioned at the time of capture.<br /><br />This book also gave me the impression that it was designed to provide its audience with small bits and pieces, as if that audience would be unable to grasp some larger, more comprehensive view.<br /><br />For some one interested in learning about digital photography, this book is not the place to start.  Instead I would suggest something like \\"Photoshop CS2 Workflow\\" by Tim Grey, or if one wanted a tutorial approach, Barry Haynes' \\"Photoshop Artistry\\" book.nvisioned at the time of capture. <br /> <br />This book also gave me the impression that it was designed to provide its audience with small bits and pieces, as if that audience would be unable to grasp some larger, more comprehensive view. <br /> <br />For some one interested in learning about digital photography, this book is not the place to start.

One doesn't want to bog the beginning photographer down with so much technical detail that he or she just gives up on the effort.  At the same time there are some critical tasks in photography that require a good insight into what technical things are happening in the camera if the beginning photographer is to take something more than snapshots.  This question came into my mind while reading this book.<br /><br />The editors of this and a whole series of photography books by AVA seem to have given serious consideration to graphic design and have created a handsome looking book.  The illustrative pictures are quite attractive.  The format presents brief instructional text under a subject heading like \\"Adding Light\\" and then a few one- or two-word pointers like \\"ringflash\\", \\"reflector\\" and \\"bounced light\\".  The editors are so committed to this format that the book starts with a section entitled \\"How to get the most out of this book\\".  I congratulate AVA on trying this approach, but I'm not sure it's effective.<br /><br />For example, for the serious beginner it's important to understand the relationship between the amount of light in the scene and the camera's aperture and shutter speed and the film or digital media's sensitivity.  The information is in the book, but in just a few very brief paragraphs.  I felt that this section could have been expanded significantly.<br /><br />On the other hand, more than half of the book is devoted to a section called \\"What to shoot\\".  Here are subdivisions like buildings and gardens, children, and landscapes.  Undoubtedly, it's important to provide the beginner with a broad overview of the opportunities for photographs and there are a lot of useful tips in each section, but some of the sections seem overdone.  There are six pages devoted to underwater photography.  This is a branch of photography that is so specialized that no one should think of undertaking it based on six pages of a beginners manual.  At the same time devoting so much space to underwater photography means that some other subject, like exposure, had to be scanted.<br /><br />Another opportunity that was missed was the discussion of digital photography.  Given that more than half of new cameras sold are now digital, this should have been an important emphasis in the book.  Yet I don't recall that there was a single mention of histograms (a display of the distribution of light values in a picture) which are one of the most significant advantages of digital cameras.  (I couldn't look up histograms in the index because there was none; a serious omission in a reference book!)  Four pages were devoted to film itself but not a page was devoted to digital capture media.<br /><br />There is a section on digital processing but I expect that only the experienced user of PhotoShop, clearly not the audience for this book, would understand it.<br /><br />Each of the many photographs in the book includes a discussion of the circumstances under which it was taken with some shooting data.  Some readers will undoubtedly find this feature useful if they give the material thoughtful analysis.<br /><br />Some of the information in the book is wrong or misleading.  For example the author suggests that longer focal length lenses have shallower depth of field.  But for a given image size on the media and the same aperture, depth of field is the same regardless of focal length.  The author also suggests that digital media don't suffer reciprocity failure during long exposures.  That is true, but she doesn't mention that there is usually increased electronic noise.<br /><br />In summary this is a beautiful book, aimed at the beginning photographer that tries a different graphic design approach to instruction.

This book aims at remedying that condition.  It has chapters on assignment and stock photography; pricing and estimating; negotiating fees and agreements; rights and value; formalizing agreements; copyright; electronic technology, business and marketing strategies; book publishing; and professional services.  Unfortunately, like a camel, which is a horse built by a committee, this book varies widely in its usefulness for the business of photography.  Among other reasons, this is because the chapters, and sometimes parts of chapters, are written by different authors, so that the work is not integrated and some important business areas are omitted.<br /><br />The first two chapters which deal generally with the nature of stock photography versus assignment photography are quite good and will be helpful to anyone making the transition from one type to another.<br /><br />Some chapters are first rate.  The chapter on pricing and estimating takes an economic approach rather then asking, \\"what are my competitors charging?\\"  It asks the question what price does the photographer need to establish in order to support himself and his business.  Unfortunately, the book is not blunt enough to say that, if you don't expect to get the resulting price, you shouldn't be in the market.<br /><br />At the other end of the scale is the chapter on marketing.  Apparently six different authors each contributed their own uncoordinated efforts.  There's some good advice here, but my litmus test was whether the book contained some discussion of how a fine arts photographer finds and approaches galleries.  There wasn't much help here.<br /><br />One area that many photographers encounter trouble with is keeping the books and paying income taxes.  Unfortunately there were no references to these subjects.  Even if all the book did were refer to a basic text or software, like Quicken or Quick Books and Turbo Tax, which were readily available at the time of publication, it would have been helpful.<br /><br />This book is a useful guide for the professional photographer to keep on his shelf for a quick answer to many questions he may encounter in business.  But for detailed answers, professional photographers will require more help in running their business.ok did were refer to a basic text or software, like Quicken or Quick Books and Turbo Tax, which were readily available at the time of publication, it would have been helpful. <br /> <br />This book is a useful guide for the professional photographer to keep on his shelf for a quick answer to many questions he may encounter in business.

In 1999, Lee Frost wrote an excellent book describing the techniques to be used to overcome the problems of photography under difficult lighting conditions.  Unfortunately the book, which makes scant reference to digital cameras and digital processing, is aimed at a rapidly diminishing audience, the users of film.<br /><br />Frost makes it clear that the way to deal with difficult lighting conditions is by controlling exposure.  In addition to the traditional camera trio of film sensitivity, aperture and shutter speed he also talks about the way to control the source of the problems of low-light shooting, that is, light itself.<br /><br />The book starts out with a description of equipment features and explains which ones are important to low-light photography.  After explaining the nature of light, he discusses the use of exposure meters.  The meat of the book is his instruction on taking pictures in various low-light situations, like action shots, landscapes, and street life.  His tips are usually simple and practical, although sometimes he appears to have gone further than most people would expect, as when he suggests putting a moon into a landscape by using a slide duplicator.  But for the most part, he gives good tips, and sometimes, as when he discusses balancing daylight, tungsten and florescent sources, he says forget about it.<br /><br />Frost concentrates on technique, and not on composition, although he often suggest how to make the most of low-light situations.<br /><br />I don't want to scant film.  But digital cameras make up more than half of today's camera sales, and digital dominates the market for cameras with controls.  Digital photography is rapidly changing the nature of low-light photography.  Why experiment with bracketing when a quick check of a histogram will give you the best exposure?  Putting the moon into a landscape has become easy with PhotoShop.<br /><br />So who wants to read this book.  Well, certainly not someone using a point-and-shoot camera.  To use Frost's techniques you need a full set of aperture and shutter controls so that probably means someone with a camera that has these controls.  I wouldn't rule the book out for digital shooters.  Frost's explanations really make clear the relationship between light, media sensitivity, aperture and shutter.  The photographer using film and the photographer willing to make the translation to digital will find the book useful.  On the other hand, there is a lot of material on film that a digital photographer may not want to wade through.e using a point-and-shoot camera.

US	53044678	R3BAE1R7IQ95S	0345464028	579397011	Iron Council	Books	4	3	6	N	Y	Anarchism Lives	Let me start out by saying that I am not an anarchist or even a very serious student of political philosophy.  Yet it's wonderful to see, in this day and age, that there are still anarchists around, even if they have only dim hopes of the philosophy's success.  By anarchism, I don't mean the philosophy advocating the overthrow of government with no purpose of establishing another system of order, but rather, the political ideal that favors the cooperative and voluntary association of individuals and groups as the method of organizing society, rather than direct or coercive government.  It is this philosophy that Mieville seems to ultimately support in the book \\"Iron Council\\".<br /><br />Although set in a world of imaginative literature where intelligent species mingle and where phenomena that appear inconsistent with the current rules of science exist, this setting is designed to illuminate the nature of an anarchist society.  It is the story of the work of its hero in creating that society, helping to lead that society to its survival and ultimately calling for it to save the even larger society from which it comes.  It starts out raising many questions for us like what is the Iron Council and who is the hero Judah Low, and then through flashback, answering these questions.  Much of the action is followed through the eyes of individuals not central to the action with their own agenda, so that we are not certain of how accurate the reporting of events is.  Those familiar with anarchist tenets will know that it pictures the disenfranchised being held down by the forces of government and economic power.  Moreover, while supporting one form of anarchy, the author examines other approaches with their strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Despite the appeal of its political argument, what most impressed me was the author's use of language to express ideas.  He twists the language out of its present conventions in a way that readers might find startling and yet it helps him to make his point.  Similes and metaphors run wild.  Consider the following example, selected at random:<br /><br />\\"There is a stretched-out tent town.  Carts are carried by mules Remade to swamp things, amphibian.  Judah walks the raised road.  Stumps stubble the ground, and beyond them the fingers of the swamp move.  Pumps howl and drain the waterways, make them mudflats, and then these mudflats become beds for new stones.  There are gangs of cactus-people, their muscles moving hugely beneath spined skins.\\"<br /><br />More than five hundred pages of this kind of language can overcome the reader, and I must confess that while there were times when I couldn't bear to put the book down, there were also times when I could hardly find the energy to continue reading.  I sometimes wished for the writing of a William Trevor or Alice Munro where the melodramatic language did not almost obscure the points being made.<br /><br />Yet here's a book that's worth the effort.  The author illuminates an almost-forgotten political philosophy that makes us examine the philosophy anew.  This is no dungeons and dragons exercise, but rather an inquiry into political philosophy in the guise of a fantastic adventure.s him to make his point.  Similes and metaphors run wild.

And that means not just as a method of creating montages of things that never were, but more importantly, as a tool to make the final photograph, be it print or electronic transmission, reflect the vision of the photographer.  But this capability comes at a cost in complexity.  Moreover, many of the tools are of little concern to the photographer.<br /><br />Tim Grey is a leading guru in the PhotoShop educational field.  He has written several top-notch books about specialized aspects of the software, as well as articles, and he teaches around the country.  Now he's come up with a book that's a step by step approach to processing digital photographs from the second they are transferred into a computer until they are saved ready for printing.  At first that sounds like something that should be simple and shouldn't require any great knowledge once the picture is taken.<br /><br />For people who are satisfied with a quick snapshot for their memory book, that will be true.  But an underlying assumption of the great photographers like Ansel Adams, and the creators of PhotoShop, is that media, whether film or digital, just doesn't have the range of the human eye.  Serious photographers have been trying to extend the range of the capturing media for many years.  That's what PhotoShop is capable of and that's what Tim Grey is teaching.<br /><br />Grey's approach is simple, methodical and almost boring.  He leads you step by step along the way with practical instructions and suggestions.  He starts out by explaining how to use the PhotoShop Raw converter, a part of the program that takes those information loaded files that are an optional format for many cameras, to recover all of the data that a camera can capture.  (The JPG format, while easy to use, losses a lot of this information.)  Grey even tells you what controls not to use because there will be better opportunities later in the process.<br /><br />Grey then gets progressively more complex.  He tells you about basic adjustments like cropping, tone and color controls and cleanup.  Many users will find that his suggestions in this area will help them to utilize the software far more effectively then they've been doing.  But then he goes on to discuss more advanced adjustments, including the targeting of adjustments to specific areas of the picture.  He finishes up with help on file saving and the automation features of PhotoShop that make repetitive tasks easy.<br /><br />The book will appeal to beginners in PhotoShop because of the simplicity and directness of its approach.  But even experienced users will glean something of use.  I've been a user of PhotoShop for several years, and I picked up a few techniques that I didn't know that have already led to an improvement in my photography.<br /><br />Grey also tailors his instruction to the users of PhotoShop Elements, the slimmed down version of the software that some photographers use.<br /><br />This book should be in the library of every PhotoShop user.  But it is not the only book one needs.  Grey's writing is instructive, and there are loads of examples, but I've found that a person needs practical exercises to master the program.  I've found the tutorials in the \\"PhotoShop Artistry\\" series by Barry Haynes to be extremely helpful in mastering PhotoShop.  Haynes doesn't provide the clear explanations for his procedures that Grey does, but his hands-on tutorials are amongst the best around.<br /><br />I do have one bone to pick.  The screen shots of selections were so small that I couldn't see the \\"marching ants\\" without a magnifying glass.

I also enjoy a story about a future society that by its changes from our present society reveals the human condition and human behavior by showing us how people behave in the new society.  If you add the hero on a quest who discovers himself because of the nature of the quest, I'm really happy.  If all an author does is update an old genre, like cowboys and Indians to spacemen and aliens, the update better be clever and original.  All of this is by way of saying that while I did not particularly care for Iron Sunrise, some readers might enjoy it.<br /><br />The McGuffin (a word that Alfred Hitchcock used to describe a plot device that misleads the audience to believe that it is what the work is about) is the inducement of a super nova in a star that destroys one world and threatens the destruction of several others, directly or indirectly.  But basically, this is a classic espionage novel.  A craft travels from stop to stop and at each destination a diplomat is killed.  A counterespionage agent, who becomes a guide to a non-professional, is assigned to catch the killers, and after a few missteps, the villains are caught.  In the spy novels set in the 20th century the craft was a ship or train, but here it's a space ship.  Instead of pistols the folks use various kinds of high-tech zappers.  Otherwise the story is unchanged.<br /><br />The civilian hero swept up into the story is a Goth girl, who sounds like the nightmare of most parents.  Unfortunately, although she saves the day, she doesn't seem to be any further along the road to self discovery at the end of the novel than she was at the beginning.<br /><br />The villains of the piece do everything but wear jackboots, and they are proud to call themselves \\"Ubermensch\\".

I mean, what could an automobile club teach me about photography?  Then I saw that the author was Tom Fitzharris, a noted nature photographer, so I decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The book starts out with a chapter on photographic equipment and technique , and then proceeds with separate chapters on 22 of the major national parks.  The book claims that it is aimed at both beginners and experts, but I'm always skeptical of such claims.  Once again, I was wrong.<br /><br />Consider the first chapter on Photography Essentials.  The techniques described are indeed essential if one expects to take better than average pictures in the national parks.  The beginner may indeed be a little awed by what the author considers essential, but he will learn where there are holes in his knowledge.  I would recommend reading John Shaw's \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\" if you want to get a better understanding of technique.  More advanced photographers will use the first chapter as a checklist.<br /><br />The author recognizes that many of the shots are classic shots that appear on calendars and postcards but says that the individual photographer's variations will make the pictures worth taking.  He also suggests that the reader study the author's photographs for ideas on how to handle different subjects and I think that's good advice.<br /><br />I was very interested in  the chapters on parks where I had photographed.  I found that not only was Fitzharris quite comprehensive, but he even suggested some places to go to that I had not visited, and some approaches I had not tried, even in parks I thought I knew well.  I wish I had had this book before visiting some of those parks.  I also know I may visit a few parks because they are in Fitzharris' book.<br /><br />I have a few minor quibbles.  Fitzharris suggested visiting Yosemite before June and shooting early in the morning and late in the afternoon to avoid crowds.  It's good advice but the last time I was there in May at 6:30 PM at Tunnel View, there were fourteen tripods set up with crossed legs by photographers making an homage to Ansel Adams.  I suppose that's better than it would be at 3:00 PM on a July day, but some of the hot spots suggested by the author will always be crowded.<br /><br />The author makes no reference to digital photography, but I don't consider that much of a problem.  The book is aimed at getting you to the best spots in the major national parks, and creating the best composition.  That doesn't change very much with digital photography.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this book was that it only covers 22 of the national parks.  I wanted more coverage.to avoid crowds.

This volume presents 450 color photographs of more than 200 species taken around the globe.  Each of the pictures is technically perfect and worth an admiring glance.  And yet there is something missing from the book.<br /><br />It's not as if these were not exciting shots.  Some of the pictures are quite spectacular.  For example, the photographs of a huge herd of wildebeests crossing the Mara River in Africa, where they are attacked by crocodile, are absolutely arresting.  But the problem is that there is nothing that distinguishes these shots from those of the other great wildlife photographers.  Indeed, I remember seeing a similar series by Joe and Mary Ann McDonald.<br /><br />One of the side effects of readily available high-tech equipment and relatively cheap travel to anywhere around the globe is that the bar has been raised for nature photographers.  Because we are all familiar with really good nature photography, even if we have only seen it in a travel advertisement, we've come to expect more.  It's not enough to have a good wildlife photograph; it has to be a great photograph.  As Cathy and Gordon Illg say in their book \\"Dynamic Wildlife Photography\\", a wildlife photograph must be beyond documentary; or as Moose Peterson says, it has to \\"pop\\".  Unfortunately most of Iwago's pictures don't go beyond documentary.  All one has to do is compare the pictures in this book to something like those in Art Wolfe's \\"The Living Wild\\" to see what I mean.<br /><br />It's not that Iwago can't make those pictures with something extra.  He includes a picture of a New Zealand takahes in a grassy field with a lake, mountains and a cloud-filled sky beyond the bird.  This picture tells you something about where this bird lives.  But opposite is a standard portrait of the bird that is mere reporting.<br /><br />Perhaps it's just too much to expect that, in a book of so many photographs, all will find that something extra.  On the other hand there are a number of pictures that must have been taken in the middle of the day, or with a film without much latitude, where the black shadows seriously detract from the image.<br /><br />At the end of the book, there are listings by class (e.g., mammals) that provide more information on the pictured animals.  Unfortunately the order of arrangement is indiscernible, which reduces the helpfulness of these notes.  I also found the captions for the photographs were not very helpful, and in some cases, incorrect.there are a number of pictures that must have been taken in the middle of the day, or with a film without much latitude, where the black shadows seriously detract from the image.

The author, Stephen Dalton, is a world famous nature photographer.  His specialty seems to be insects, and he captures them in ways we cannot see with the human eye, by using electronic flash.<br /><br />The book looks at the way that insects, birds and men fly, with separate chapters devoted to aerodynamics, insects, birds and manned flight.  It's clear that certain principles apply to all of these types of aerialists, like the use of lift to overcome gravity, and one can find a common thread throughout.  However, the modes of flight between self-propelled animals and men are so different that they scarcely seem to belong between the same covers.<br /><br />This is made even more evident by Dalton's work, for despite being a scientist, he must be considered first and foremost a photographer.  The pictures of insects and birds in flight are astonishing because he captures the animals doing things with their wings and bodies that we would never guess occurred.  Combined with the excellent illustrations in the book, one can really develop a detailed understanding of how animals fly.<br /><br />The chapters on manned flight are a different thing altogether.  Most of the text is devoted to a history of the failures of manned flight, particularly by those who tried to imitate insects and birds.  The pictures of manned flight are way below the standards of the pictures of animal flight.  In fact you can probably see pictures of the same quality by picking up an airline's magazine out of the pocket on the seat in front of you while you're on a flight.<br /><br />Still the chapters on insect and bird flight are quite good.  I've read a few basic ornithology texts and never gotten as many details as this on the mechanics of bird flight.  And I did learn how it is that an insect that was once said to be scientifically incapable of flight can actually get airborne.<br /><br />I think I would have been happier with this book if Dalton had provided more pictures of insect and bird flight and forgotten about manned flight.with this book if Dalton had provided more pictures of insect and bird flight and forgotten about manned flight.	2005-05-02

I can't remember how many I drew in kindergarten.  In later years when I was an aspiring artist, I loved to do pastels of unpainted barns because of the wide range of colors in individual boards.  So it has come as a surprise to me that some photographers have decided that their artistic record of the vanishing American barn should be preserved in monochromatic tones.  Perhaps the photographers think that black and white is more artistic than color and that these barns deserve artistry.  (Most people familiar with the works of today's color photographers would feel that color can be just as artistic.)<br /><br />David Plowden's book is a collection of such black and white pictures taken of barns across the Northern United States from New Hampshire to Montana, with a few stops in Canada.  The pictures are simple shots of barns, both inside and outside.  Neither human nor animal appears in any of them.  The photographer states that his purpose is to capture these structures before they vanish from the American scene.  The pictures are direct and almost confrontational.<br /><br />Given Americans' long-standing belief that we are an agrarian society, these pictures should appeal to some ineffable feeling in our souls.  Clearly this book tells us that it is meant to be art.  It's sized for the coffee table, has plenty of white space in the text and often has a blank page opposite a photograph.  And yet this book seems curiously lacking in soul, and static.  It seems merely a record.<br /><br />The reason why is quite simple.  The range of light in almost every one of the pictures is strangely constricted, as if the pictures were always taken on a cloudy day.  Perhaps we've just been taught that black and white photography should cover the full range of light from the deepest blacks to the clearest whites.  This is the tradition of fine arts photography passed down to us from the likes of Ansel Adams.  Plowden seems to have taken a different path, and it doesn't contribute to his stated goal.<br /><br />For someone interested in artistic pictures of America's barns that elicit a feeling of loss for the past, I would instead recommend \\"Harker's Barns\\", an unassuming soft cover book by Michael Harker, published by the University of Iowa Press.  Unlike Plowden's book, this is an undiscovered treasure.  And unlike Plowden's work, the pictures have a strong subtext of love for the subject.l Adams.

This book made me reconsider some of my fundamental feelings about art and photography.  For example it made me consider the distinction between non-representational and abstract art.  I realized that non-representational art has no counterpart in the world.  Abstract art might have such a counterpart, but it is more concerned with line, form, color and other indicia as such than with the subject itself.  I also realized that just because a photograph must start with something in the real world doesn't mean that it can't be abstract and concern itself with indicia rather than the subject.<br /><br />All of this is by way of saying that \\"Fine Art Flower Photography\\" is a book of abstract art that starts with real flowers, but which has as its subject line, form and color.  And it is a terrific and inspiring book.<br /><br />By using a variety of photographic techniques, Sweet is able to divorce line, form and color from their subject and present them in a pure manner that delights the eye.  In fact Sweet was so effective in doing this that he transformed my vision of other abstract art and its value.<br /><br />Sweet accomplishes this task by manipulating depth of field, multiple exposures and camera movement to present us with a view of flowers that we would never see with the unaided eye.  And these views are surprisingly striking, evoking deep, non-rational responses in the viewer.  I have never believed that aesthetics was simply the province of the beautiful, but these pictures certainly can be used to support such an argument.<br /><br />I've long had a feeling that manipulating a photograph in the camera in a way that one could not see in a peek through the viewfinder was somehow not real art.  Sweet makes it clear though that he starts with a visualization of his final image and then takes the steps to make that vision come true, which of course is exactly what all the great photographers have done, and which is certainly a process that leads to art.<br /><br />This book could stand on its own, as a set of beautiful images, but expert photographers will also find valuable lessons here.  Sweet's comments are pithy, but for a person who understands the photographic process, they can suggest the technical steps that will allow the photographer to follow in Sweet's footsteps.  My question is whether Sweet has set the bar so high that no one can exceed him.  But perhaps these same techniques can be applied to other forms of photography to make different statements that are as beautiful.<br /><br />Although Sweet has used film as his medium, digital photographers will be inspired to apply his same techniques, either in camera or in post processing.<br /><br />Bravo.<br /> <br />This book could stand on its own, as a set of beautiful images, but expert photographers will also find valuable lessons here.

In the first, which I call narrative, the author tells you about the topic and provides pictures to illustrate the teaching points.  In the second, which I call exemplary, the author provides a picture and then tells you what considerations went into the choices that he made in taking the picture.<br /><br />When I first read this book, I thought that I was dissatisfied with it because it followed the exemplary style.  Then I looked at two of my favorite books that use the exemplary style: Art Wolfe's \\"The Art of Photographing Nature\\" and Tony Sweet's \\"Fine Art Nature Photography.\\"  Wolfe's book uses examples but presents them in a well developed, logical order, from fundamental to complex issues.  Sweet's book, on the other hand, does not provide this structure but is aimed at photographers who know how take pictures but want to go further in their art; his pictures are truly magnificent and his explanations of his goals in taking the pictures are insightful.<br /><br />Kahn on the other hand appears to have taken whatever photographs he had in his files on water, without regard to quality, mixed them up so there was no logical order of presentation, and then written inane comments.<br /><br />As I read the book, I felt that it was aimed at inexperienced photographers, but failed to develop the subject logically.  For example, in photographing moving water one of the first choices to be made is whether to shoot at a fast or a slow shutter speed.  Fast speeds freeze the water while slow speeds create a silken blur.  This isn't even mentioned by Kahn until late in the book.<br /><br />But there are many more weaknesses.  For example, he has several pictures where the sky is overexposed because the water he was photographing was in a dark area.  One way to deal with this is by using a graduated neutral density filter.  Kahn doesn't mention this anywhere in his book.  He also excludes any reference to full neutral density filters which are used by water photographers to lengthen exposure time to achieve water blur.<br /><br />People interested in photographing water would be better served by Heather Angel's book, \\"How to Photograph Water.\\"  Aside from a more logical, comprehensive presentation and better photographs, Angel also deals with water in all its forms, like fog and snow, which Kahn ignores.  Neither book mentions digital photography, but I believe that a competent digital photographer will be able to apply the material presented in either book.any reference to full neutral density filters which are used by water photographers to lengthen exposure time to achieve water blur. <br /> <br />People interested in photographing water would be better served by Heather Angel's book, \\"How to Photograph Water.\\"  Aside from a more logical, comprehensive presentation and better photographs, Angel also deals with water in all its forms, like fog and snow, which Kahn ignores.

It tells you how to sell photographs.<br /><br />It doesn't tell you anything about equipment, or picture taking, or processing, or even how to run a photography business.  It doesn't even take a comprehensive approach to marketing.  Instead it provides useful tips on marketing photography, period.  Moreover, Bourne doesn't just limit himself to one market, like stock photography.  He covers all the markets and if one secret isn't applicable to you, the next one may be right up your alley.<br /><br />Calling it \\"88 Secrets\\" is a misnomer, because many of the ideas contained are simple common sense that someone interested in selling pictures could figure out for him or herself.  Secondly, there are far more than 88 secrets because many of sections called secrets contain more than one idea for marketing.<br /><br />The reader will sometimes say, I knew that, sometimes say, I should have known that, and sometimes say, I never thought of that.  But if you read the book and you follow some of the tips, you will increase sales of your pictures.  Although the book is quite short, it's also inexpensive and the person willing to follow Bourne's advice will soon amortize the cost of the book.  It probably won't put you in direct competition with Art Wolfe, but it will increase your photographic income if you have the will power to follow the tips.<br /><br />For example, the author discusses a traditional subject, query letters to editors to whom one hopes to sell pictures.  He tells you what has to go into a letter if you want to get the editor's attention.  He even provides a sample letter.<br /><br />In the very next paragraph, Bourne discusses something relatively new, e-books and how to go about publishing them.  He even suggests software that will ease the work, and even how to structure an e-book.  He says photography e-books are most popular if they take a how-to, travel, or adventure approach.  \\"It will be easier to sell an e-book that features pictures of Yellowstone National Park if it is written as a travelogue rather than an attractive Yellowstone picture book.\\"<br /><br />I've read a few books on marketing pictures and sometimes find reasonable marketing advice buried in the verbiage.

And of course, take a reasonably good picture.o, travel, or adventure approach.  \\"It will be easier to sell an e-book that features pictures of Yellowstone National Park if it is written as a travelogue rather than an attractive Yellowstone picture book.\\" <br /> <br />I've read a few books on marketing pictures and sometimes find reasonable marketing advice buried in the verbiage.

He's back on track with \\"The Golden Transcendence\\".<br /><br />This is the third book chronicling the adventures of Phaethon in his journey from a society with a computer-integrated mind to the stars.  But this is not a book for someone looking for quick action.  Instead this book will appeal to readers who can enjoy almost endless debates about the best way to use a virus to attack a self-deluding computer, or the objectivity of morality, or the inevitability of the ultimate entropy.  Wright masterfully describes these arguments but one must enjoy logical disputation in a computerized world to stay with the material.<br /><br />On the other hand the first one hundred pages includes an exciting confrontation that proceeds microsecond by microsecond.<br /><br />As in previous volumes, the author brings us long lists of things and activities like the heroine's description of the hero as \\"a clod who does not have the sense to see what's right in front of his nose, who keeps running off, getting in trouble, getting lost, getting shot at, losing and finding bits and pieces of his memory he cannot keep straight, ruining parties, building starships, starting wars, upsetting everybody, and keeps saying I'm not his wife whenever he's losing any arguments with me, which he does all the time.\\"  Apparently Wright's word processor can't identify run-on sentences.<br /><br />It's clear that the author believes that even though computers will be smarter than men in the future, men will benefit from the association.  Less clear is whether Wright has libertarian political views that are buried within the novel.<br /><br />Also intriguing and irritating are the throwaway ideas, hidden in techno-bable.  For example one character wonders how differing engineering system philosophies can result in different outcomes to end events.  Maybe this idea is old hat to engineers, but it stopped me in my tracks and made me wish there was more discussion of this point.<br /><br />Like the previous books, nothing is what it seems at first, and the plot has as many twists, turns, red herrings and surprises as any mystery.  And like the previous books the hero seems as much of a naïve prig as before.<br /><br />Yet, even with all these complaints, the Golden Transcendence is a fitting close to the Golden Age trilogy.in my tracks and made me wish there was more discussion of this point. <br /> <br />Like the previous books, nothing is what it seems at first, and the plot has as many twists, turns, red herrings and surprises as any mystery.

Rather than attempt to cover the entire range of nature photography, Angel focuses on just one aspect of the environment, water, but she views it in all its forms and she looks at other subject matter that interacts with water.<br /><br />She starts the book with a rather general discussion of the photography of water, including equipment, films, lighting and exposure.  The reader who is already a nature photographer will probably find that the equipment he or she already owns is just fine for the task at hand, although there are a few things the author suggests adding to the water photographer's tool box that one might not have considered.<br /><br />Next the author provides a gallery of her own work that is both inspirational and instructive.  This is followed by chapters on water in its various forms: calm water, moving water, frozen water and water vapor.  These chapters are chock full of useful tips.  However they come at you so fast that you probably won't remember them all.  Instead, the photographer would be wise to review an applicable chapter before going out and shooting in one of these environments.<br /><br />Finally she mentions several kinds of photography that couldn't be neatly categorized into a prior chapter, like water and wildlife, water abstracts and close-ups.<br /><br />The book is illustrated with the author's excellent pictures, and in each case she tells you what influenced her to approach the subject in a particular way.  She does not dwell on questions like exposure.  Instead the book is aimed primarily at intermediate to advanced photographers who do not expect a quick solution to problems but are happy to accept a few suggestions.<br /><br />Unfortunately the book, published in 1999, makes no reference to digital photography.  In fact, a good deal of material deals with the problems of film.  While a competent digital photographer can make the translation to the digital world, much of the film talk will just be excess material to digital camera owners.  I look forward to a digital edition of this book.<br /><br />I was interested in this book because I've noticed that certain of my pictures of water needed improving.

Readily available modern camera equipment makes it easy for anyone who cares to make a technically perfect picture of an animal.  Advances in travel allow photographers to go anywhere to photograph even the rarest of animals.  As a result viewers have become accustomed to seeing good wildlife pictures.  As a further result, to get viewers' attentions, photographers have to go beyond merely documenting an animal.<br /><br />The authors suggest ways to accomplish this.  Among other things they advise using unusual lighting and eye-catching composition, capturing behavior, and learning and using whatever is special about your subject.  They advise incorporating weather into the your pictures and capturing the moods of animals, even at the risk of anthropomorphizing them.  This book is all about composition.<br /><br />It's all good advice, but I have to confess, other than so clearly articulating the premise, there's nothing that hasn't appeared in other books on wildlife photography.  Like the documentary pictures described by the authors, nothing separates this book from the crowd.  I certainly had more fun reading Moose Peterson's \\"Guide to Wildlife Photography: Conventional and Digital Techniques\\" where his discussion of making pictures \\"pop\\" was similar to the Illg's ideas.  I wondered if this book was meant primarily as a showcase for the authors' photographs.  And while these pictures are attractive and interesting, I'm not sure that they all reached the level to which the authors aspire.<br /><br />There is no discussion of technique in this book, except to the extent that it impacts upon composition.  That's not necessarily bad, but it means that the book is limited in what it discusses.  Experienced wildlife photographers who are looking to take their work to the next level may find something here to think about.  People new to wildlife photography will be better served by a book like the late Bill Silliker, Jr.'s \\"The Master Guide for Wildlife Photographers\\".l Silliker, Jr.'s \\"The Master Guide for Wildlife Photographers\\".	2005-02-10

Each page contains text and photographs or diagrams.  The layout resulted in beautiful typography but almost seemed to interfere with a coherent development of any subject because of the desire to shoehorn the material into the two-page format, when clearly some subjects required extensive development that couldn't be so limited.<br /><br />Moreover the level of detail was not enough to help a beginning close-up photographer in the basic tasks or an experienced photographer in complex tasks.  Instead the book was most useful as an idea book about what is possible in close-up photography.<br /><br />Often the author offered opinions without any substantiation.  For example, he regularly indicated that single lens reflex cameras were best for close up work, but never explained that that was due to the difficulty of framing a close subject due to parallax errors with a camera whose viewfinder is not on the lens axis.<br /><br />There is also a lot of bad information here.  For example at one point he suggests manually calculating exposure for a flash picture.  I found this incredible given that fact that most digital cameras provide for some sort of automatic, through-the-lens, metering of electronic flash.<br /><br />But then I should not have been surprised.  Undoubtedly every publisher now wants photography manuals pitched at digital photographers.  Indeed the title of this book is \\"Digital Photography Expert Close-up Photography\\", and the cover states that it is the \\"definitive guide for serious digital photographers\\".  And yet there is not a single mention of what I consider to be the most useful tool offered by digital cameras, a histogram of light values to aid you in calculating exposure.<br /><br />Finally, much of this book is devoted to something other than close-up photography.  For example, the discussion of rocks and stone features pictures of a slot canyons and petroglyphs all of which appear to be at least 10 feet distant from the camera.<br /><br />I don't want to suggest that this book is totally without merit.  Scattered throughout the book are tips that a close-up photographer might find useful.  For example the author suggests it may be possible to achieve depth of field by compositing several pictures of a small object in editing software, each with a different focus point, to create the appearance of sharpness where a single image would not succeed.  But for someone looking for a well-conceived, total approach to the art of close-up photography, using a digital camera, this book is not a help.s, a histogram of light values to aid you in calculating exposure. <br /> <br />Finally, much of this book is devoted to something other than close-up photography.

This book doesn't do that.<br /><br />It has a few good points.  The typography is excellent with plenty of white space and clean layout.  The pictures are good.  And several times the author uses a series of pictures to build up to the best picture of a subject, just as a photographer in the field might develop his vision of a subject.<br /><br />Now the bad points.  The book is thrown together by mixing a lot of different learning points without relationship to each other and treating them in a superficial manner.  It's as if no one ever told the author about making an outline of his teaching points before starting to actually write.<br /><br />Then there is the approach to digital, or rather a lack of it.  One would expect that this book would suggest a way that the digital aspects of photography could be used to enhance the taking of nature and landscape photographs.  Instead the author completely ignores the nature of digital cameras.  For example one of the most important devices a digital camera may contain is a histogram to allow you to adjust exposure.  (A histogram is graphic representation showing the distribution of light values in a picture.)  A good book would tell you how to use the histogram.  The author's only reference to a histogram is to tell you that shots of the sea can be tricky and one should check the histogram.  In the glossary, the author does explain what a histogram is in language similar to the parenthetical expression used a few sentences earlier in this paragraph but he never tells you how to use the histogram.<br /><br />But wait.  There's more.  Often he perpetuates myths that are just wrong, or at least require more information to be useful.  For example he says that telephoto lenses have less depth of field then wide angle lenses, which is not true if the image size of a subject on the sensor is the same, or that split neutral density filters don't work with telephoto lenses.  And the essential nature photography skills he leaves out are legion.  There is no mention of the use of flash or any of the so-called \\"rules\\" of composition.<br /><br />I can't suggest a single book that will provide you detailed information on both landscape and nature photography and digital photography.  However for a comprehensive, well-organized approach to nature photography nothing beats John Shaw's \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\" even though he doesn't mention digital.  To see how to capitalize on digital cameras' characteristics I recommend \\"Shooting Digital\\" by Mikkel Aaland.

He has published many books showing wild animals but \\"Eye to Eye\\" is certainly one of his most famous.  It consists of dramatically close-up photographs of animals, always concentrating on the eyes of the subject.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts: \\"One on One\\" shows photographs of single animals, often so close that the frame is filled completely with just the animal's eyes.  \\"Two by Two\\" usually shows pairs of animals, although there are occasional shots of larger groups.  Often the pictures are of mother and child, or mates, but a few shots show conflict.  \\"All in All\\" shows shots of larger groups of animals.  The book also contains a two page section called \\"Behind the Camera\\" in which Lanting discusses his photographic philosophy but provides few hints that will allow others to copy his style.  Finally, perhaps because the text of the main sessions is limited to species name, there is a section of thumbnails with a brief statement concerning the picture.  I found this section to be particularly inadequate since I often said to myself \\"How did he do that?\\" but got no help in finding an answer.<br /><br />These are amazing pictures, primarily because Lanting has managed to get so close to his subjects.  In a few pictures we can see that that is a result of enlarging and cropping, but in most cases the pictures are sharp enough so that so that we realize he was really close to the animals.  Moreover, with a few exceptions, these are not captive animals.  I for one would not like to take a picture of a wild lion at a distance of twenty feet.  At least one critic has suggested that this book raised the bar for all wildlife photographers, forcing them to get closer to their subjects, and placing more stress upon photographers and subject.<br /><br />There are moments of great intimacy, particularly in the \\"Two by Two\\" section, where the pictures of parent and child tug at our heartstrings.  It's hard not to see human characteristics in these photos.  The book also benefits from its layout, grouping its subjects by actions.  Thus there are pictures of a huge flock of butterflies followed by pictures of ibises, penguins, snow geese, zebras and elephants all purposefully on the move to some destination.  I also particularly enjoyed facing pictures of a lion and a leopard, moving toward the centerfold in mirror image.<br /><br />These are great photographs because the photographer got so close to his subjects.  But they are also mostly documentary.  Few of the pictures rise to the level where the form rather than the subject makes them art, although I was particularly struck by a picture of Oryxes carefully treading their way across the Namibian sand dunes.  But when I compare Lanting's photographs to the work of other wildlife photographers like Art Wolfe, I can see the difference.  The pictures in Wolfe's \\"The Living Wild\\" show each animal in its environment, where Wolfe was better able to concentrate on the composition of his subjects to create a more artful picture.<br /><br />Not withstanding this quibble, \\"Eye to Eye\\" is a great book, and readers are unlikely to soon forget these close encounters with the other living inhabitants of our planet.heartstrings.

They undertake the publication of books, not because they expect them to be profitable, but because the books need to be published.  \\"Harker's Barns\\" is such a book.  It will never make a profit.  It would probably have been too expensive for its creators to have self-published.  And yet it deserves to be published, not just for what it tells us about barns or a vanishing agrarian society or even about the ways of photography, but for what it tells us about love.<br /><br />The book consists of seventy-five black and white pictures of barns and other farm buildings.  Those who care about black and white photography will admire the edge between peeling paint and dry wood and the texture of sun and wind bleached wood.  They will also admire the sense of time hidden in some of the pictures.  I am thinking of a photograph of a barn, obviously taken at the smallest possible f/stop, to get the depth of field needed to have the barn etched sharply from front to rear.  And yet as a result of the long exposure necessary with this small opening, the weeds in front of the barn, blown about by a passing wind, are ablur.<br /><br />This is a book about love, make no mistake.  It is about the love of the photographer for his subject and what it represents in his mind, and it is about the death of a loved one.  And it's about the love that many of the people who helped in the project must have felt for the subject, and perhaps for the vision of the photographer.  And of course, it is about the love, perhaps unspoken and unacknowledged, of the farmer for his farm.<br /><br />The photographer laments the gradual loss of the small family farm and expresses his hope that this book can somehow preserve it.  And yet the photographer must know that this is a fatal economic disease from which there is no hope of recovery.  The small Iowa farm that the author loves makes little economic sense in a modern society that requires efficiency in everything it consumes.  Who of us will pay twice as much for a tomato from a merchant who tells us that such a price will support the farmer who continues to till the land in a way that makes no sense in an industrial society, but does so because that farmer wants to follow his heart rather than his reason?<br /><br />Normally the text that accompanies a book of photographs is an unnecessary garnish, designed to fill space.  But Jim Heynen is a poet, and his words are short and pithy and help us to look at the subject from a slightly different viewpoint.  For example, he says \\"Windows in a round barn follow the light of the seasons, thus giving a sense of agreement with nature.\\"<br /><br />Even if you don't like black and white photography, even if you don't like farms, the very idea of this book may appeal to you.  For it is clearly a work of love, and perhaps the reader can learn to love like the photographer.fficiency in everything it consumes.

After the success of his first novel, \\"Altered Carbon\\", it would have been a difficult task for Morgan to come up with an equal.  Unfortunately, he has not.<br /><br />One of the problems of a science fiction series is that the introduction to the series presents us with a new world.  Our enjoyment often comes from seeing how psychological and social functions alter to fit the new society, and in turn, how that illuminates the psychological and social functions in the readers' lives.  Besides updating the detective novel of Hammett and Chandler, \\"Altered Carbon\\" allowed us to understand the effects of portable personality on individuals and society.  There's not much more room for this development in this novel.<br /><br />We still have the same hard-boiled Takeshi Kovacs as a hero, (assuming we can use that word to describe a highly skilled winner with no principles) but now he is a military adventurer who will work for the highest bidder.  He undertakes the task of opening a gate to a long dead society for an evil corporate giant.  His comrades are a squad of hardened professional soldiers and an attractive archeologist.  His opponents include a corporate suit, and a general.  Once again he engages in battle with assassins, soldiers and high technology killing machines.  He continues to have enough attraction for several of the female characters to provide a few explicit sex scenes.<br /><br />But there is little new in the character.  His experiences do not transform him, or us.  The final shot-out could have been in almost any space-cowboys opera.<br /><br />Moreover, I felt that there was a long sequence near the end of the book designed to appeal to our sadistic tendencies, or at least our anger at large groups.  There is a painful torture and then a massacre that adds little to the story but perhaps may satisfy the reader's need for aggressive behavior.<br /><br />The author has the annoying habit of showing us that a speaker is pausing between words by using a period and capitalization between words, as in \\"they were.  Screaming.\\"  Apparently Morgan finds the punctuation devised in English to show pauses inadequate.  It's.  Annoying.<br /><br />Without giving away major points, many of the environments and situations presented are reminiscent of other science fiction works.  In \\"Altered Carbon\\" that worked to illuminate the hard-boiled detective genre.  Here it just seems to reflect a lazy imagination.<br /><br />It's time for Morgan to scrap Kovacs and invent a new society if he wants to keep writing science fiction.  We should read this book without great expectations.ds, as in \\"they were.  Screaming.\\"  Apparently Morgan finds the punctuation devised in English to show pauses inadequate.  It's.  Annoying.

The book is a collection of screen shots of fifty different homepages with a description of the purpose of each web site and a chart showing the allocation of screen real estate amongst topics like navigation, content and advertising.  Most of the authors' real estate is used for number-coded comments about each homepage.  In addition, based on their analysis of what does and does not work on the sites, the authors provide a list of guidelines for homepage designers.<br /><br />This useful book calls attention to common mistakes that have been made in the design of homepages by major companies, many of them in the Fortune 500, like Microsoft and Ford.  Indeed, one complaint I had is that none of the web sites analyzed were sites for individuals and small companies.  Given that, after seeing half the pages, one already has a pretty big dose of knowledge about large company mistakes, it might have been pleasant and useful to look at how to improve the web sites of small timers.<br /><br />One of the things that the authors urge is consistency in the design of homepages so that users will be able to find their way around homepages more easily.  For example they urge that any search box be placed in the upper right or left hand corner.  They also weigh in against animation on a homepage.  One of the dangers of hewing to the authors' consensus rules is that homepages may develop such a sameness that users won't differentiate between them.<br /><br />One problem with the book is that although the authors are concerned about easing the way around the homepage for users, they haven't eased the reader's way around their comments.  The numbered circles keyed to the comments are organized right to left and top to bottom on the page.  But readers will look at one area and then another on the page with the screen shot and will have a hard time coordinating the instincts of their eyes with the numbered comments.<br /><br />There are also some curious appendixes.  I suppose it might be useful for comparison to have all of the logos laid out on a two page spread, but what is one to make of an appendix called \\"Smiling Ladies\\" with a selection of graphics from the homepages, not all of which are smiling ladies.<br /><br />This is a good reference book for professional designers of big web sites.  The homegrown webmaster will probably find something like \\"The Non-Designer's Web Book\\" by Robin Williams, (the third edition of which is planned to be published in February of 2005) more useful.will look at one area and then another on the page with the screen shot and will have a hard time coordinating the instincts of their eyes with the numbered comments.

Is a four-year old book about one of the most rapidly changing phenomena in the modern world worth reading?  Well, it all depends what you already know.<br /><br />\\"Guru\\" is a word often attached to Veen who is known in the Internet community as a consultant and lecturer.  In this book he offers his views on what was, at the time of publication, cutting edge issues in web design.  After providing a review of the growth of the Web, he urges consistency in construction and a clear articulation of structure in the design of web sites.  He feels that the building of top quality websites requires a deep understanding of technique, well beyond simple coding.  He explains the real problems of the \\"browser wars\\" for designers and users, and the importance of speed in downloading websites.  Veen suggests that advertising can be more effectively integrated into Websites and finally suggests a process to allow the creation of websites on-the-fly that will allow the designer to keep up with an ever-increasing pace of use.<br /><br />Most of the time Veen tries to take a long view of web design, dealing more with what the web should be doing rather then telling the reader \\"how-to\\".  But when necessary to make his point, Veen can get into code, as he does when describing how to make liquid page layouts or construct a dynamic Web site.<br /><br />Veen's writing is direct and simple and I always was surprised when I reached the end of a chapter at how quickly it had come.  The technical aspects are not overwhelming, even to non-coders, although some knowledge of HTML and script writing, while not essential, will make it easier to comprehend.<br /><br />A lot of what Veen talks about has already become standard practice.  He urges the use of Cascading Style Sheets, which at the time of writing, were the cutting edge.  Dreamweaver MX 2004, the most popular full featured program for building web sites not only uses Cascading Style Sheets but also sometimes has to be told when not to use them.  And Dreamweaver also has the interfaces for the quick construction of dynamic web sites.<br /><br />On the other hand, given some of the big commercial web sites that I've seen, a lot of web designers still need to understand the importance of consistency, speed and concern for the user that Veen urges.<br /><br />If you are a heavy-duty programmer, most of the techniques that Veen promotes will be old hat (or should be) but his philosophical approach to the web might still be useful to you.  On the other hand, if you are out there building your own web site, to support some other activity that is your main concern, the goals that Veen suggests for your website are unlikely to have been emphasized in your effort to learn technique.  Moreover, learning about some of the more advanced approaches might help you to build a site that's special.not to use them.

We follow his adventures in a society made up of other exiles and see an example of the one-eyed man being a king in the land of the blind.  We also remeet Daphne Tercius, an iteration of Phaeton's wife, Daphne and follow the couple in a joint adventure.<br /><br />Literary critics often suggest that nothing should be in a story that does not contribute to the ultimate story line.  However, most of this book seems to be a diversion from the story of Phaeton's effort to take the Phoenix Exultant into deep space.  However, given the author's penchant for surprises, deception and red herrings, it may be that what appears to be a diversion will be essential to the story.  But certainly as a stand-alone novel, the diversion seems unnecessary.  But that is just one of the many literary elements that preclude consideration of this volume as a stand-alone book.<br /><br />Part of the excitement of the original book was the discovery of the nature of the society that the hero lived in.  There are few additional surprises about the societal organization in this book.<br /><br />The relationship between Phaeton and Daphne is fleshed out in this volume.  Unfortunately, it reminded me of the bantering Nick and Nora Charles from the old Thin Man movies.  Even though humor is always appreciated in a novel, most of the attempts here fall flat.<br /><br />The surprise revealed near the end of the novel reminded me of the finding that an entire season of the TV show Dallas was merely a dream.  Any hints of where the story was going, something that readers might expect from an author who is dealing with them fairly, were too subtle for me.<br /><br />Finally, Phaeton reveals himself as even more of a pompous, naïve bore than he seemed in \\"The Golden Age\\".  It's hard to get excited about a hero who the reader does not care about.<br /><br />In summary, if \\"The Golden Age\\" delighted you, you will probably need to read this book, and the third in the trilogy, \\"The Golden Transcendence\\".

What gives \\"The Golden Age\\" its special excitement is that it takes place far in the future, when men and computers have melded in a variety of different ways that provide not only immortality but also the ability to perceive the actual world as a virtual reality.<br /><br />When a person first starts reading this novel, there is a moment of disorientation because the full dimensions of the world in which the hero, Phaeton, lives are not clear.  Although solution of the core mystery will intrigue readers, it is the thrill of discovering and understanding this world that may provide science fiction fans with the most delight.  But even as the reader tries to get the hang of what's going on, he or she must also pay attention to every small detail, for something presented quickly, without fanfare, will later return as a major factor in the development of the story.  Even though the author has provided the reader with a Dramatis Personae briefly describing the key characters, one will also have to attach actions to their roles to avoid confusion.<br /><br />Certain stylistic aspects of the story may seem slightly repetitious.  Why there are two courtroom scenes that have many of the incongruities of an old Thorne Smith screwball comedy is questionable.  Also, the author has a tendency to run through a long list of nouns and verbs in a row when he wishes the reader to see that things are complex.  This technique wears thin after the second or third use.<br /><br />That the hero speaks like a 19th century Victorian while the house computer often appears as a virtual penguin seems to be an effort at giving the complex plot an unnecessary comic twist.<br /><br />Yet the search through a virtual reality, which may not reflect a true reality, where the world is infested with viruses that make it impossible to know if one can accept the testimony of the hero's electronic senses makes for compelling reading.<br /><br />By the way, before you start this book, you should know that its curious mysteries will not be solved in this volume, but require you to read two more books.

But the computer and its software can't apply good design principles.  That's up to the user, who often has no design training.  This little book teaches basic design and typographic skills.<br /><br />This book is quite amazing.  The individual untrained in design can read the whole book in several hours and learn enough to provide a major improvement in graphic output.  Williams explains four basic principles of design that are simple and straightforward and can be applied to every graphic design project.  The author then shows how to apply these principles to specific kinds of projects.  Finally, she discusses typefaces, or fonts, and the way they should be used, in a way that's so clear that I wonder why it ever took me so long to learn the differences.<br /><br />And that's the book.

I've been to the Mojave and to Death Valley and I don't remember them looking so beautiful.<br /><br />Dykinga's style reminded me of the work of Eliot Porter, with modern film stock.  Most of his pictures have the same subtle quality, created by the use of analogous colors, that is, colors near each other on the color wheel, and varying only by tint or small changes in hue.  A Dykinga picture almost always has one dominant hue like brown or tan or blue, and the hue rarely feels intense, even if it's a field of California Poppies.<br /><br />It's obvious that Dykinga's work utilizes a large format camera.  Everything is in sharp focus from foreground to distant mountains, thanks to small apertures and the ability to twist the light through his camera.  This means that the picture is not going to immediately draw your attention to one aspect of the scene by controlled focus.  More likely, the viewer will have to work his way through the picture, discovering things along the way.<br /><br />The layout of the book seems to be well considered.  Quite often two plates with similar subject matter will face each other and there is a synergistic effect from the comparison.  For example, I delighted in examining two facing pictures of desert sunflowers.  In both cases the yellow orange flowers have a hilly background, but one group of flowers is pushing up through dried-out, cracked clay, while in the other picture the flowers are growing from a small body of water collected for a brief time from rainfall.  The mud and the water are both magenta in color but the textures are completely different.  The thoughts that arose from the juxtaposition were not only about the variety of the desert but also about the nature of color and vision.<br /><br />I suppose one reason that I never saw the dessert the photographer portrays is because most of the pictures were taken at the golden hours of sunrise and sunset.  To have been that many places in the desert at just those times would have taken me months and months.  At the very least, I can be a philistine and thank Dykinga for saving me a lot of time.<br /><br />As to the text in the book, my feeling is that it probably has to be included for marketing purposes.  Janice Bowers' essays seemed poetic and show that she loves the desert, but like most such commentaries, they do little to illuminate the photographer's work.  I suppose the essays are worth reading once.  The pictures on the other hand can bear many, many viewings and add something to the sense of the place each time.<br /><br />I finally concluded that I was looking at the desert through Jack Dykinga's eyes when I viewed this book.  I resolved to return to the actual desert again and see if I could continue to see it through his eyes.use most of the pictures were taken at the golden hours of sunrise and sunset.

Well this one isn't, and if one keeps a few concepts in mind, is almost as good as anything one can find on the subject of close-ups of insects.<br /><br />After a brief introduction, the author promptly launches into a discussion of the equipment that one needs to take insect close-ups.  Luckily, TTL flash, one of the boons of modern technology, was already on the scene, so the equipment discussion, whether of macro lenses, close-up diopters or tripods, is still applicable.  The only thing that has changed is the availability of digital media.  As long as one remembers that digital photographers have the ability to change the ISO speed of the media with each shot, and that exposure may be easily checked with histograms and \\"blinkies\\" there is no cause for concern here.<br /><br />Although the author's excellent pictures are used throughout the book, the second section is a portfolio of the author's insect and spider pictures, where he describes the circumstances surrounding the taking of each picture in detail.<br /><br />In the third part of the book the author discusses what he calls \\"Photographics\\", that is, the techniques to be applied for the use of the equipment which he previously discussed.  He dwells on exposure and tonality and talks about the differing requirements for using three types of light: natural light, fill flash and total flash.<br /><br />Finally West talks about finding subjects, including the ethics involved in photographing insects.<br /><br />The author's words are simple, clear and concise and if you follow his instructions you should be able to take good pictures of insects.  I have only a few quibbles.<br /><br />I believe that his discussion of total flash photography could have emphasized the importance of making sure that the flash was far stronger than any ambient light to prevent blurred images.  Thus, even though all of the pictures in the book of the author taking photographs in the field show his flash on a mount that places the flash as far forward as the front of the camera lens, he did not make it clear that this was to help overcome the ambient light or tell you in the text that this position was desirable.  Similarly he could have suggested that using a low ISO with flash also helps to reach this same objective.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that there was no significant discussion of taking pictures of flying insects, since this is far more difficult than taking pictures of stationary insects, and yields far more exciting pictures.<br /><br />John Shaw, in his \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\" covers the same ground as this book, although with less emphasis on insects and more instruction on other aspects of outdoor photography.  If you really want to see terrific insect macrophotography, see John Brackenbury's \\"Close Up\\".  There's not much instruction there, but lots of inspiration.<br /><br />West's book is a fine guide for insect macrophotography, with excellent pictures to serve as an example.sh was far stronger than any ambient light to prevent blurred images.

A great outdoor photographer sets for himself the task to taking one, but only one, photograph each and every day for an entire season.<br /><br />One can see all kinds of implications.  Once the photographer finds a subject he must get it right the first time because he isn't allowed a second chance.  Exposure, focus, composition - everything must be right and as good as he can get it.  Moreover he is continually in peril.  Should he pass by a good shot in the morning in expectation of a better shot in the afternoon?  And what happens when no better shot is in the camera as sunset approaches?  We can easily believe Jim Brandenburg when he says that the exercise was a transforming experience.<br /><br />But the question for viewers of this book is whether the pictures are a transforming experience for us.  Unfortunately, they were not for me.<br /><br />I understand that some of the pictures were bound to be underexposed or out of focus.  Plants blow in the wind; animals move.  But while I examined the photographs in this book, I also looked at other work by Brandenburg.  These other collections were always quite impressive, providing new ways of looking at the world.  Many of the pictures in \\"Chased by the Light\\" showed a keen sensibility for the light.  The silhouettes of loons and a small island with trees against the backlight of a clouded dawn were breathtaking.  The photograph of a raven's feather against a lichen background with a few beaded drops of water on the feather caught my eye.<br /><br />But for every great photograph, there was one that was pedestrian and one that was discardable.  I certainly didn't need to see an out-of-focus mink or trees in the forest with no true subject.<br /><br />To be fair to Brandenburg, this project was apparently not undertaken for publication but rather as an exercise for his own development.  It was his editor who wanted to publish after seeing the photographs.  To the editor's eye, at least, the pictures were enlightening and well worth the effort.<br /><br />The greatest value of this book was not in the photographs but in the speculation in which I engaged about why this book was not outstanding.  Is photography a stochastic process with each photograph taken possibly leading to an even greater photograph?  Did forcing himself to elect when to take his daily picture cause Brandenburg to sacrifice opportunities, or even limit his willingness to take risks.  Does the order of presentation of photographs have synergistic effects, which were lost, because this book almost demanded only chronological order?  Does forcing the viewer to look at pictures that would otherwise be discards detract from the impact of good pictures?<br /><br />For me this book was conceptual art.

In North America there are less than 900 species of birds.  While some may be only 3 or four inches long, others are measured in feet.  New birding guides are issued every year.  And while a few species, like the empidonax flycatchers may be difficult to tell apart, all of the species are illustrated in most guides, and 90% are identifiable if the birder gets a good look at them.<br /><br />Now consider the amateur entomologist.  There are over 80,000 species of insects in North America.  Most insects are relatively small.  Telling the difference between species may require examining the vein pattern in wings.  The field guides to insects illustrate at most 700 insects.  No wonder there are more bird watchers than insect watchers.  And no wonder there hasn't been a major insect field guide published since 1981!<br /><br />A field guide to insects then probably can't help you identify most specific species.  The authors feel they have done their job if they can help you identify the family.<br /><br />Unfortunately most, including this Audubon Guide, may not even do that.<br /><br />To test insect guides I took a series of photographs of each of three insects and then tried to identify them with the help of the guides.  They were pictures of a butterfly-like insect, a bee and a fly.  To find an insect in Audubon one first looks through an index of over 100 different insect and spider silhouettes.  Located next to the silhouettes are the pages in the guide where insects resembling the silhouette are grouped.  One can also use a thumb tab located on the page edge of each set of plates to find the desired silhouette.  Next one goes through the individual plates adjacent to the silhouette to find the picture of an insect resembling one's target.  The text page relating to each insect shown is listed under its picture.  The text provides a description of the insect family and behavior but no illustrations.  The plates are ordered by color and shape and not by insect order to make it easy to identify an insect without knowing anything about its taxa.  However, because of the literal nature of a photograph, one may not be able to identify the family of an insect not pictured.<br /><br />In the case of my butterfly-like insect I was not able to identify it, although because I knew from other research that it was a Brown Skipper, I did find the picture of a different looking skipper.  For my bee and my fly, I saw several similar insects but was unable to identify either as to family.<br /><br />Unlike the other insect guides, the Audubon includes a section on spiders, which are not in the insect family.  Since one is likely to encounter arachnids while searching for insecta, this may be convenient.<br /><br />The Audubon has one of the easiest to use methods of finding an insect of any of the insect guides.  However, if the guide doesn't include a picture of your insect in its 627 plates (it also has 63 spider plates), one may be unlikely to identify a specimen or its family.  This may leave you as frustrated as any of the other insect guides.<br /><br />Users who prefer drawings to photographs might want to examine the Peterson Field Guide, \\"Insects\\" by Donald Borror and Richard White.

With Dreamweaver one can create complex web-sites more easily than if one were writing in hypertext markup language (HTML).  (My son who does this for a living says he can create sites just as quickly by writing HTML directly, but his old man certainly can't.) But this is not a simple program to use.  The slim green volume that accompanies the software merely scratches the surface and it is unlikely that anyone could put together anything more than the most rudimentary site with only the instructions that come in the manual.<br /><br />Instead one needs a book like \\"Dreamweaver 2004: the Missing Manual\\" to begin to tap the potential of the program.  This book is part of a series by Pogue Press aimed at supplementing software vendors' instructions.  McFarland, using straight forward simple language, takes you through the steps to basic competency with the program, using several tutorials that one can download from the publisher's own website.<br /><br />But don't think this will be a simple task.  If you are not familiar with HTML you will have to get at least 200 pages into this volume of more than 800 pages to comfortably create a site.  But you shouldn't stop there.  Even if you skip to only the most essential chapters, you'll want to go back and consider how to integrate your website with programs like Flash and Shockwave.  And if you expect to spend any time building or developing websites you'll also want to learn how to use the Dreamweaver power tools like snippets and templates.  Advanced users can even learn how to create dynamic web sites tied to databases.  The author covers it all.  Unfortunately the software is powerful but not very intuitive.  As a result, as I used the program to revise my own website, I found myself frequently looking in the book's index to find help.  Most of the time I found it easily.<br /><br />And the dirtiest secret of all is that eventually, if you want to build complex websites, you are going to have to learn some HTML.  Oh, not a lot of tags, but at least the structure of the language, so you can go into the code and make changes.  I found myself occasionally lousing up a page so badly that I couldn't figure out how to use the Dreamweaver design tools and had to go into the program's code view to straighten things out.  Of course, this wasn't the author's fault - he gave me everything he could, but it's a complex program.  Still I don't see how anyone who's serious about building a website would want to be without Dreamweaver, and how anyone who's not an experienced programmer (and perhaps even some who are) would want to be without this book.book's index to find help.

But professional photographers also have to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to market photos, because without sales there is no profession.  One of the tools professional photographers use is a \\"book\\".  A book is a portfolio of the photographer's pictures used to get clients to hire him or her.<br /><br />Now it might seem that a photographer's pictures could stand by themselves and not need any special method of presentation.  The author, who is a consultant to photographers in the preparation of their books, disagrees.  She believes that everything from the drafting of a positioning statement about the photographer's work (which will guide the selection and display of pictures in the book) to the texture of the slip case for a book is critical for the photographer to get the edge over competing photographers.  After you finish this book you may agree with her.<br /><br />The author gives simple straightforward advice.  Indeed it is so simple that most of the text in this volume could probably be contained in a short brochure.  What fills most of the book is the pictures taken by the author's clients, which illustrate the points she makes along the way.  If you pay attention to Oppenheim you probably do stand a better chance of catching an art buyer's or art director's eye.  On the other hand, unless you already feel comfortable with the economics of marketing, you may gulp when she tells you to spend $125 for what is essentially a loose-leaf binder.<br /><br />Most of the message contained in this volume, and the photographs included, seem to be directed at assignment photographers, that is, those who must sell a buyer on purchasing his or her skills, rather than selling existing photographs.  Yet other photographers from stock to fine arts also probably need a book.  While those photographers seem largely ignored by the author, they can benefit from the advice contained here.<br /><br />I must confess that I'm a little resistant to an assumption underlying the approach of this book, i.e., that photography buyers and directors are willing to form an opinion, at least initially, from form rather than substance.  But then again, photographers deal in form, not substance (I don't mean that negatively), so I suppose a nice looking book is important.  I wish there was a little more meat in this book, but I suppose even a few words that can show the error of marketing common sense, and the importance of following a path that works, are worth the time and cost of this volume.advice contained here. <br /> <br />I must confess that I'm a little resistant to an assumption underlying the approach of this book, i.e., that photography buyers and directors are willing to form an opinion, at least initially, from form rather than substance.

Anyone else looking to get into the photography business or improve photography business skills should probably look elsewhere.<br /><br />The author's approach is to offer a topic related to the business of photography and to raise issues, but she seldom provides answers, and when she does, they are seldom of use to most photographers.  For example, the author has a chapter on lawyers.  In it she indicates the legal problems that a photographer might face, from copyright to leases.  Instead of telling the reader anything about these subjects, she says to hire a good lawyer.  As my kids say, duhh...!  Similarly she says there are several different forms of ownership that a photographer can use.  Therefore... consult a lawyer.<br /><br />And when she does give advice, it is often wrong and dangerous.  For example, she says that in determining whether a person is a contractor or an employee, one should look at whether a person does the same job for several different people.  Actually, the government regulations provide 14 separate points that have to be considered with no one-point controlling.  Several judicial nominees have learned how important this issue can be.<br /><br />But where the author really misses the boat is on the issue of marketing.  For any businessperson, including a photographer, marketing is perhaps the most important function.  If you don't have income, you don't stay in business.  But the tips the author gives only apply to studio photographers.  Marketing is different for a stock photographer and an editorial photographer, and for all the specialties in between, but Orenstein seems to ignore this.<br /><br />I don't understand why this book needed photographs, unless it was to meet the requirement for 320 pages.  But if one is going to include pictures in a book aimed at photographers, they'd better be good.  The pictures in this book are muddy black and white pictures on paper with a low reproduction quality.<br /><br />Perhaps it's impossible to write a book about the photography business that applies to all the specialties in the game.  I know that it is possible to write a useful book aimed at a specialist, because I have the example of John Shaw's \\"Business of Nature Photography\\".  Even though a little dated, it is probably more helpful generally to someone getting into the photography business than Orenstein's book is.are muddy black and white pictures on paper with a low reproduction quality. <br /> <br />Perhaps it's impossible to write a book about the photography business that applies to all the specialties in the game.

This book is full of pictures of loons, with some supporting discussion, and a CD of loon calls.<br /><br />The book describes and defines loons, including how to find them, their family life, their calls, how to photograph them and loon conservation.  The pictures in the book were taken by the late Bill Silliker, Jr., who was a famous wildlife photographer, and the book is clearly a vehicle for his work.  Many of Silliker's pictures are first rate and quite striking, especially considering the difficulties of photographing a bird whose colors range from the brightest whites to dark, matte black.  Sometimes, however, he shoots into the light when trying to record some element of loon behavior (not a deliberate silhouette) and these photographs are less successful.  I must also confess that after 100 pages, even though I love loons, the pictures had developed a certain sameness.<br /><br />The narrative provided was more of the \\"aren't loons great\\" type then being very useful.  The book told me little more about loons then several pages in Kenn Kaufman's \\"Lives of North American Birds\\" or David Allen Sibley's \\"Guide to Bird Life and Behavior\\", although it did make clear to me that the reason loons nest on the water's edge is because they find it impossible to walk on land.  Although the book notes that there are 5 species of loons in North America, it is devoted only to the common loon.  Serious birders may well have to wait for the Oxford University Press to get to the loons in their series on Bird Families of the World for really detailed information.<br /><br />I was particularly disappointed by the book's discussion of photographing loons.  It's clear that most, if not all, of the pictures in this book were taken from a boat.  Having done a little bit of avian photography from a kayak, I know that this type of photography requires some different techniques than shooting from terra firma.  I would have liked to see some discussion of how to follow the bird photographer's rule about getting close to the ground when you are on water.<br /><br />Although its clear that the CD of loon calls was an afterthought, (there is no reference to it in the text about the calls of loons,) listening to it is (pardon the pun) a hoot.  While I doubt that anyone would ever mistake any loon call for the sound of another animal, filling your den with the call of these ancient birds is thrilling.<br /><br />In summary, this looks like a good gift book for someone who likes loons and good pictures of them.  It certainly is not a thorough reference book.han shooting from terra firma.

Fortunately Grey, who also publishes the daily on-line newsletter, DDQ (Digital Darkroom Questions), writes clearly and succinctly.  The publisher has apparently decided to launch a series of books that deal at a micro-level with digital photography.  For example one of Grey's other recent books is \\"Color Confidence, which tells the digital photographer how to match up the tones, tints and hues of his camera, monitor and printer.<br /><br />Perhaps a better title would have been the Output Book, since the book is concerned with the output of the digital photography process: printed images; on-line displays; and slideshows.  The book is a strange potpourri of information, some of it easily available elsewhere and other information harder to find.  For example, the authors tell you how to use outside print services, either in the form of a local lab or an on-line service.  Most of this information is readily available by walking into a lab or going to an on-line printing site.  On the other hand, some of the information on setting up a web site was completely new to me.  Oh, I knew a little bit about coding, but I certainly didn't know that search engines were more likely to index your site if you included alternative text in the HTML \\"img\\" tag.<br /><br />If your eyes glazed over after that last sentence, don't worry.  The authors don't advocate HTML coding for most people.  Instead they recommend programs like Dreamweaver and Front Page for the development of full-blown websites and even provide a little instruction, although no one should think that they could use these programs without some more study.  But they don't ignore PhotoShop's Web Photo Gallery facility that can turn out a professional web site with very little effort.<br /><br />There is a companion website to the book, where one may examine more detailed examples and even download some templates.<br /><br />Even though the book's subtitle says it is about selling images, that section of the book is very limited.  It really only talks about finding galleries to show your work, and selling on the Internet.  There is no mention of stock sales.  Given that John Shaw's \\"The Business of Nature Photography\\", which is probably the premier book in this field, was published in 1996, there certainly is a need for a volume that goes into more details on marketing in the digital age.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book on preparing your photos digitally for output, Barry Haynes' \\"PhotoShop Artistry\\" series is one of the best, although it may require augmentation by books like Mikkel Aaland's \\"Shooting Digital\\", or Bruce Fraser's \\"Camera Raw with Adobe PhotoShop CS\\" and even Grey's \\"Color Confidence\\".

Anyone without specialized equipment and skills who has ever tried to take a picture of a butterfly, will realize the need for this book, which covers all the bases.<br /><br />The author explores this field in a methodical way, starting with chapters on equipment (he favors medium-format cameras) and moving on to subjects like exposure, magnification and depth of field, ways to increase magnification, working with flash and natural light, composition and design and operating in the field. The author assumes you know something about these areas in general photography and emphasizes the special skills for insect photography. In the second part of the book he discusses subject matter, including dragonflies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars and other insect groups, again from the point of view of photographing these insects. He also briefly discusses managing your photographic collection, marketing and selling your work and photographing abroad. The book is profusely illustrated with the author's pictures of insects, with a brief description of his considerations in taking each picture.<br /><br />If close-ups of insects are your interest, this book will tell you how to do it. Unfortunately much of the material is repetitious, which you may appreciate if you want to know that the same techniques apply to shooting dragonflies and moths. The technical skills are covered more concisely in one chapter in John Shaw's \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\", although the emphasis is not on insects.<br /><br />Moreover most of the pictures are record shots of standing insects, with no flight shots, although the vivid colors in some pictures are quite striking. However, there are certainly none of the magnificent and awesome photographs contained in John Brackenbury's \\"Close Up\\" (although that book is disappointing as a guide to technique).<br /><br />The insect descriptions are general rather than species specific, although the author does provide a good list of references. Most of these will be of more help to photographers in the British Isles than other places, although the author is always careful to include at least one U.S. reference.<br /><br />I don't quite know what to make of the chapters on managing a collection, marketing, and photographing abroad. They are really too generalized to be of much use.<br /><br />Still if you want to learn the specifics of insect photography in more detail than Shaw provides, this book will prove useful.pecific, although the author does provide a good list of references.

One would be as a book on macrophotography techniques.  I would give that book one star.  The other would be as a book of close-up photographs.  I would give this book five stars.  The thrills I encountered in this book led me to the second choice.<br /><br />John Brackenbury is a zoologist who has developed a distinctive style of macrophotography.  He has developed special equipment that allows him not only to shot sharp, large pictures of insects, but also his own style of shooting which he calls panoramic close-up photography.  His technique tries to place the camera in the position of an insect to view the world as an insect sees it.  This means that not only are the photographed insects and plants tack-sharp but also the distant backgrounds like trees and buildings.  He has conquered the problems of depth of field with a specialized camera that he built that can close down its aperture to f/256!  He uses huge banks of special lights to provide illumination for this unusual camera.<br /><br />What pictures he takes!  As I write, I'm looking at a large picture of a locust in mid-flight from a leaf and both the leaf and the locust are in absolute focus.  You can count the hairs on the locust's legs and see each sharply etched vein in its wing.  I flip to another page and look at a chrysopa in flight, framed by the sharp foreground wings of another chrysopa.  The only problem with these pictures is that the insects are so sharp, and the surroundings equally sharp that the pictures seem almost fake, because this is sharper than we can see with the human eye.<br /><br />Moreover these pictures are not just technically superior.  The author has captured a strange beauty that no human can see with the naked eye.<br /><br />The author has also captured some pictures that are not of insects or plants that use the same techniques, like that of a huge pair of earrings in the foreground with a much smaller woman wrapped in a shawl in the distant background, both in full focus.  While these pictures exploit the technique, they leave me wondering just what is going on.<br /><br />The other side of the coin is that although the book is subtitled \\"Creative Techniques for Successful Macrophotography\\", I learned nothing that I could use in my own work.  Even if I thought I could build a camera like Brackenbury's, there certainly isn't enough of an explanation to begin to point me in the right direction.  Most photographers will learn more about close-ups of the natural world by reading the 27 pages on the subject contained in John Shaw's \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\".<br /><br />And yet the pictures are so magnificent that even if I haven't learned a single thing about how I might replicate his technique, I was inspired to try to improve my own macrophotography.d in a shawl in the distant background, both in full focus.

One of the most important and difficult things is learning what to take a picture of, and then designing an image that expresses something about its subject. Many authors of photography books talk about teaching the photographer to see. I think of that as being the process of selecting a subject and then deciding how it should look to capture the photographer's vision of it. Bryan Patterson promises to teach that in the revised edition of \\"Learning to See Creatively\\". Unfortunately, he doesn't keep his promise.<br /><br />It's not that this is a poor book. The author talks about the elements of photographic design like line, shape, form, texture, pattern and color. Unfortunately he doesn't link these elements to the photographer's vision. It's as if one knew nothing about tools, had a plumbing problem, and was presented with a wrench. It would be nice to be told how to use the wrench to solve the problem. If you know how to relate the tools to the problem, you don't need this book.<br /><br />He also talks about composition and guidelines like the rule of thirds, or frame within a frame. But even here, he doesn't make the connection to vision. Even the chapter called \\"Expanding Your Vision\\" turns out to be a discussion of the characteristics of lenses of different focal lengths.<br /><br />There are chapters on digital photography and photographic careers but they look like they were added on to the work because somebody thought that was what would help the book sell.<br /><br />Peterson's photographs are good. When he explains why he made the design and composition choices for a particular picture you can see some relationship of technique to vision. It's also interesting to occasionally see a comparison of the same subject handled two different ways. But unfortunately the author doesn't take the opportunity to relate similar pictures to photographic vision.<br /><br />This might be a good enough book for the intermediate photographer who isn't really ready to work on his or her vision, although I much prefer Brenda Tharp's \\"Creative Nature & Outdoor Photography\\" which covers the same ground in a more concise way.<br /><br />One might think that you can't teach someone to see creatively. That may be true, but Freeman Patterson's old standby, \\"Photography & the art of seeing\\" comes a lot closer than this volume. And books like those by Galen Rowell or Tony Sweet do a much better job of relating technique to the visions of their authors.gh book for the intermediate photographer who isn't really ready to work on his or her vision, although I much prefer Brenda Tharp's \\"Creative Nature & Outdoor Photography\\" which covers the same ground in a more concise way.<br /><br />One might think that you can't teach someone to see creatively.

I love the histogram and blinkies on my DSLR, and naturally I shoot in camera raw so that I can control processing even more.  I've used the camera raw plug-in for PhotoShop ever since it came out.  But I;ve been unhappy with the information I?ve been able to find about camera raw in the various books and magazines I've read.  Oh, everything you need to know is in the off-line and on-line documentation, but I've always found you have to know what you are looking for to find some of the features.  A typical example for me was sharpening.  I knew that I wanted to sharpen my images after I got done with all of my adjustments so I set sharpness at zero in the camera raw plug-in, but sometimes that meant that I had to make adjustments in camera raw on fuzzy images.  I never knew that you could set the preferences for camera raw so that there was sharpening of the preview but not of the image exported to PS.  It was in the manual but I never found it.<br /><br />All that's changed since reading \\"Real World Camera Raw\\".  It's all in there along with lots of information about the File Browser, metadata and automation.  And it's in a readable form!  You can start on page 1 and go through to the end on page 218 in a day without too much trouble.  Of course, you'll have to return to individual paragraphs when you go to apply what you learn, but you will know the power of these features.<br /><br />This book is not about art, or what adjustments you should actually make to get the output you want.  For that, I still recommend Barry Haynes' \\"PhotoShop Artistry\\" series, with its extensive tutorials.  This book is about procedures.  For example because the gamma of the raw image is linear, so that much more data is concentrated in the highlight end of the scale, the last adjustment that you should make in the plug-in is normally shadows.<br /><br />Much of this book is aimed at heavy-duty users.  I doubt that I will ever need to process hundreds of images a day so that I will need to use most of the automation functions described by Fraser.  But there are a few I will try.<br /><br />Obviously this book is for the serious PhotoShop user.  But if you fall into the category, I can't see how you will not benefit by reading this bookrs.

There are many spectacular, and some astounding, pictures of the raptors.  That Vezo was able to get so close to birds catching their prey; eating their prey; with their young; and feeding their prey to their young, is beyond my imagination.  The title page shows a kestrel perched atop a cactus with a lizard in its claw; the next page a prairie falcon crying defiance over a just-killed dove in an arid western landscape, and the book goes on from there.  Two to four pages are devoted to each bird.  But this is not a birding guide.  This is a book of photographs.<br />This is not to suggest that every photograph is a wonderful shot.  There are many record shots of hawks gliding against a blue sky.  While these are not as impressive as most of the pictures, I suppose they were necessary for a book dedicated to presenting views of all of the avian raptors of the American West.<br />One of the questions that this book raised for me is whether these photographs were art.  There is certainly not the well-developed sense of line and color that the great bird photographer Arthur Morris presents in his pictures.  But looking at Morris' work, I also notice that none of his raptor pictures are as arty (no pun intended) as his other work.  Vezo has set himself a difficult task.  These birds are handsome, not pretty, and their chicks are sometimes downright ugly.  Most of them seem to be glaring at us with hostility.  They don't have long sinuous necks whose curves can be emphasized.  And yet as I looked at a picture of a perched zone-tailed hawk, against the blue western sky, with its tail feathers displayed, I certainly felt a sense of admiration for these birds, which appear to be so much more in control of their world than we mere human beings.<br />A brief narrative by Glinski accompanies each set of pictures of a particular species.  The writing is romanticized and filled with varying amounts of information on the birds.  No one would ever buy this book for the text, although it seems customary to provide this sort of thing.  Instead what they would want is the striking pictures, and anyone looking at them will not be disappointed.uld ever buy this book for the text, although it seems customary to provide this sort of thing.

The pictures in this book all have impact.<br />This is not a book about techniques.  The author presumes that you know how to take a competent photograph.  What Mackie says he wants the reader to do is to learn how to see.  He says that he will try to explain what he saw, and how he formed that vision, when he took a photograph that had impact, with the hope that the reader will be helped to find his own unique compositions.  His chapters deal with light, designing the image, color and form, and enhancing the image, with a brief coda on the equipment he uses.  He is quite comprehensive in his discussion of each of these topics, and if the reader studies each paragraph closely, he may learn something about composition.  For example Mackie almost always uses polarizing filters to intensify colors and urges the reader to do the same.  He is also not afraid to use other color filters to achieve his goal, and the reader may become convinced that there is no truth in a photograph, so one should always do what it takes to make an exciting picture.<br />My problem is that while the pictures have impact, Mackie's writing doesn't.  The text just didn't hold my attention, although perhaps as I go back over the pictures, I?ll start to extract some new directions for my own work.<br />There is no doubt that the most difficult thing to teach any photographer is how to develop vision.  Amongst recent books though, I've found Brenda Tharp's &quot;Creative Nature &amp; Outdoor Photography&quot; to embody better instructional material.  Tony Sweet's &quot;Fine Art Nature Photography&quot; with Sweet's dramatic pictures and brief comments about what he was trying to achieve and the tools that he used to reach his goal are quite instructive because of their pithiness.  Niall Benvie's &quot;Creative Landscape Photography&quot; can force one to examine some of the underlying assumptions about the subject matter itself that effect the ultimate picture, and Freeman Patterson's hoary &quot;Photography &amp; the Art of Seeing&quot; can still provide exercises for the unselfconscious to find their inner vision.<br />With company like that, Mackie would have to do more than present his own photos with impact to create a first class instructional manual.  He would have to spend as much time thinking about teaching as he does about taking pictures.tools that he used to reach his goal are quite instructive because of their pithiness.

The author of the volume, Terry Hope writes regularly about photography.<br /><br />The book devotes between two and six pages to the photographs of each of the 38 photographers selected.  Besides the photographs, there is a statement of several paragraphs from each artist that may explain how he or she came to landscape photography or what techniques are used.  Then, each picture is also supported by a few sentences that explain how the photographer came to take the particular picture or select his or her technique.<br /><br />The quality of the printing is good, although interestingly, when I compared pictures in this book with the same photos in books presented under the aegis of the individual photographers, there were sometimes significant differences in hue.<br /><br />There is no doubt that each of the pictures is world class.  One could quibble with the selection of photographers but the pictures themselves are great landscapes that will appeal to those who love this genre.  The problem with the collection is that there are not enough pictures by any individual photographer to really develop an appreciation of his or her art.  Moreover, because the pictures are organized by artist, it's difficult to develop a sense of the different approaches that photographers take to subject matter or technique.  That doesn't mean it is impossible, but it will take a lot of work on the part of the reader without any help from the author.<br /><br />For example one could compare the picture taken by Jack Dykinga of a boulder in Joshua Tree National Park with one taken of the very same stone by Michael Fatali.  The slight variations in angle and light in the sky present different pictures that can tell you something about the individual photographer and his approach to landscape.  In fact, close reading of all the work can help the reader to understand that these pictures are not merely recording physical phenomena.  Instead they are showing how the great photographers bring their own vision of the world to the subject matter and, indeed, impress that vision upon the subject matter.  The close reading may actually lead one to ask, what is the truth of a photograph if the photographer can so alter what he sees without changing the form of the subject?<br /><br />The book is most useful as a tool to introduce the reader to photographers of whom he may never have heard and then lead the reader to further acquaint himself with those he likes.

Others complain if there is the least deviation in color between what they remember seeing and what gets printed up.  It is at this latter group that &quot;Color Confidence&quot; is aimed.<br />Tim Grey, the author, is a respected teacher of Photoshop techniques and is known to many for the Digital Darkroom Questions mailing list, which many digital photographers read on a daily basis.<br />This book is aimed at a single issue in digital photography: how to make the output of the digital photography process, be it individual print, world-wide web, or printing press, match the color that the photographer visualized when he took a picture.  Several years ago, when photographers were less sophisticated and happy with the ease of getting digital output, this was scarcely a question, but as digital photographers became more experienced (and as affordable techniques became available) more and more photographers began to ask why the output of their printers didn't look like their monitors.  The field of color management was born.<br />With a minimum of technical jargon, the author explains the nature of color.  He then tells you how to establish color profiles for input devices, like cameras and scanners, processing devices like computers, and output devices like ink-jet printers, so that all of the devices in the digital darkroom pass on information about the digital photograph that will insure consistency.  For computer software, Grey assumes the use of the industry standard, Photoshop.  If you use some other image processing software, you will have to interpolate from Photoshop, or find some other source of color management information.<br />If you read every word in this book, Grey might appear pedantic, because when he discusses using several different devices for a particular purpose, he will repeat many of the same instructions, word for word.  But if you later pick up the book, while you are sitting at your computer, you know that what you are reading will be the whole story for the operation and tool that you are using, and that some important hint is not hidden elsewhere.<br />I?ve long considered myself to be relatively savvy when it comes to color management.  However, I picked up a few tips about along the way that clearly made the book worthwhile for me.  For example, I understood the function of &quot;soft-proofing&quot; but never really developed a regular work process dealing with this technique.  Then I read Grey's discussion and a light bulb went on.<br />This is not exciting reading, but the author is clear and direct and moves the subject along quickly.

It includes the winning pictures from the BG Wildlife Photographer of the Year Competition, which is sponsored by the Natural History Museum (of London), BBC Wildlife Magazine and BG Group.<br />Thousands of photographs are submitted by wildlife photographers from all over the world, from which a panel of distinguished judges selects winners, runners-up and commended pictures, as well as one overall winner.  The categories include various classes like animal behavior, composition and form, and animal portraits.  Those familiar with nature photographers will recognize many of the competitors' names, like Thomas Mangelsen, Arthur Morris, Patricio Robles Gil and Norbert Wu.<br />Each photographer includes a short comment about the circumstances of the picture's capture.  Photographer-readers will like the fact that technical data is provided for each photo.  Almost every one of the pictures is quite beautiful and some are quite astounding.  Although I was quite familiar with Joe McDonald's picture of a lion killing a buffalo, I still shuddered when I saw the lion's death grip and the terror in the buffalo's eyes.  Andy Rouse's picture of a roe deer buck peering at us from a field of chest high red flowers is lovely.<br />Each of the pictures in the volume can stand by itself as a worthy photo.  My problem is that the pictures, by the nature of the contest, don't hang together as a book.  Photographs in a book on a single subject or by a single photographer have a synergistic effect.  We learn more about the animal or the photographer's vision than any one picture can convey.  That is totally lacking in this book, with the exception of the short portfolio by Vincent Munier that won the award for photographers aged 26 years or under.<br />People who love wildlife pictures will not be disappointed by this book.  On the other hand, they may want to consider subscribing to a magazine like &quot;Nature's Best&quot;, published quarterly by the Nature's Best Foundation.  There is a contest issue with pictures by many of the same photographers as enter the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, AND the three other issues contain extensive portfolios by a individual photographers, usually on a single subject.re's Best&quot;, published quarterly by the Nature's Best Foundation.

For almost seven years I've had a 20 by 30-inch print by him hanging on my wall.  It shows a herd of bison moving up an S-shaped creek bed in Yellowstone Park in a snowstorm.  The colors are muted and condensed into a narrow range of light that provides a subtle contrast to the huge beasts.  A similar picture appears on the cover of Holdsworth?s portfolio of pictures of the wildlife of Yellowstone and Grand Teton.<br />The pictures in the book cover the full range of animals that dwell in the two parks and surrounding area.  Although most of the pictures show the dominant wildlife forms like buffalo, moose and elk, there are also pictures of other less frequently seen animals like grosbeaks and mountain lions.  And apparently, in those few cases where Holdsworth did not have an image that satisfied his vision, he included the pictures of other photographers.<br />Holdsworth is not afraid to put principal players into a subordinate position in a picture to tell a story.  I was particularly impressed by his treatment of wolves.  There are some good close-ups, but I really found the picture of a bull elk in the fog with the vague outlines of five wolves at a greater distance, just barely visible in the thick grass and fog, to be quite an effective story teller.  Another picture of a line of wolves making their way through the snow and pines of the Lamar Valley tells a dramatic story even though there is no prey in sight.<br />Holdsworth loves to take pictures under difficult conditions.  Many of the pictures show animals in the steam that erupts from inside the earth in Yellowstone, but the photographer also captures foggy, misty days and animals surviving in a snowy landscape.  In many of these pictures the range of light is greatly subdued.<br />Unfortunately this style may also be Holdsworth's greatest weakness, for commercial purposes.  The current trend in outdoor photography is highly saturated pictures with the full range of tones from the most impenetrable blacks to eye-dazzling whites.  Some of this is the legacy of Ansel Adams, and modern-day photographers like Art Wolfe.  Some of this is the result of the ability to manipulate the image in digital programs, like Photoshop.  But Holdsworth seems to have rejected this style to follow his own path.  At first I thought that this was a result of the printers' lack of art.  However, the few pictures in the book that are more in keeping with current sensibilities convinced me that this limited range of light was a conscious style decision that the photographer had reached.  Whether you like it or not depends on your own aesthetic.<br />Even if this is not your style, the animal pictures are wonderful enough in form that nature lovers will appreciate this book.  And lovers of Yellowstone and Grand Teton will treasure this book.tones from the most impenetrable blacks to eye-dazzling whites.

There is nothing in this book about photography techniques (although Shaw has written plenty of excellent books that do just that.)  This book is crammed with practical business advice, from broad guidance like what subjects to shot for the most sales, to nitty-gritty advice like how to package your photos for mailing.  He answers questions that other photography marketing books don?t begin to address: why is nature photography different from other commercial photography (nature sales are mostly from an existing stock of shots); what is the minimum-sized library needed to go into the business (at least 1000 first-class bread and butter photos of a variety of subjects); and similar questions.<br />Shaw's writing is direct and simple.  Some of what he says I certainly know to be true from my own very brief experience in a commercial photography market and other things he says, of which I have no experience, have the true ring  of advice of which I would never have thought on my own.<br />Shaw includes many of his own beautiful nature photographs in the book.  And he at least makes some attempt to tie the pictures to what he is talking about.  I?m not too concerned that the connections are sometimes tenuous.  After all, how do you illustrate the advice to consider having your contract with a stock agency include the obligation to provide you with tearsheets?<br />So what's wrong with this book?  Well, it's eight years too late.  This book was published in 1996.  Since that time the development of electronics has changed the photography field.  Shaw's description of filing systems was written before some of today?s excellent computer-based storage and tracking systems were available.  Most importantly, digital imaging was just a blip on the radar that only merited mention in a three-page appendix.  When published, editors would only consider color slides for use.  Today, more and more of the people who buy (or really, lease, as Shaw makes clear) photography are willing to consider digital images.  And I suspect that the presentation of those images to prospective purchasers and the preparation of those images by the photographer for use have greatly changed the procedures suggested by Shaw.<br />It is a shame because this book is so clearly and usefully written.  No other book on the business of nature photography has been so helpful in the past.  Even more of a shame is that I have heard Shaw say he has no present plans to update this book.<br />So, if you are a nature photographer who wants to learn how to go into business, get this book.  But buy yourself of subscription to the magazine Digital Photo Pro.  And stay tuned for further updates.a blip on the radar that only merited mention in a three-page appendix.

It is not concerned with photography techniques (for the most part) but rather with the logistics of earning a living as a nature photographer.  The approach is a logical one, first giving the reader an overview of the nature photography &quot;industry&quot;, and then telling one how to find clients.  Hicks discusses such things as legal rights, photo libraries and even self-publishing.<br />The author writes about traveling for photography and how to prepare for it.  He acknowledges that one of the biggest problems that the professional photographer will face is loneliness, and suggests ways of dealing with it.  He talks about managing the office and buying equipment, both photographic and otherwise.  In a chapter on &quot;special skills&quot;, he provides a concise statement of nature photography techniques that can serve well as a short course in the subject.<br />I particularly enjoyed his chapter on professional issues.  I had never considered the ethics of photographing in a &quot;disreputable&quot; zoo, and thereby supporting its work.<br />The book is profusely illustrated with Hicks' nature photographs, which are of high quality, but bear no relationship to the text.  Moreover, the text itself mostly suggests what I found to be self-evident.  The details are not emphasized.  For example, the author says that it may be possible to barter with hotels and airlines while working for other clients.  I would have liked to know which functionary in an organization was best to approach to initiate such a deal.  But that level of detail was never provided.  One thing of which the book convinced me is that breaking into nature photography is one tough job.<br />I found that even though it was not aimed at showing you how to become a professional photographer, the biographies contained in &quot;The World?s Top Photographers: Wildlife&quot;, by Terry Hope, provided more clues about routes into a professional photography career while showing a world-class collection of pictures.  And John Shaw's &quot;Business of Nature Photography&quot; still seems a better guide to making a living in this field.uot;, by Terry Hope, provided more clues about routes into a professional photography career while showing a world-class collection of pictures.

The book consists mostly of photographs of birds with the sparest of remarks about each picture.  As a pleasant surprise there are none of the usual essays preaching the virtues of conservation.  The author lets the pictures speak for themselves.<br />Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico is on everyone's list of the ten best birdwatching sites in North America.  Every year hundreds of thousands of Snow Geese and Sandhill Cranes make Bosque their winter home, and thousands of bird photographers flock there for the chance to capture exciting photographs.<br />Most of Jamieson's pictures were taken in the early-morning and late-afternoon reddish light that photographers call the magic hours.  Jamieson fills the frame with pictures of individual birds and presents crowds of flying geese that seem to spill over into the margins.  Many pictures are of birds silhouetted against the morning or evening light.<br />Twenty years ago, this book would have been awesome, but photographers like Arthur Morris and his friends have raised the bar in recent years.  Today's bird photographers emphasize the importance of separating the subject from the background so that the bird really stands out.  They do this by a variety of techniques, like reducing depth of field, getting low to the subject and making sure the birds are not close to the background.  In many of Jamieson's pictures, particularly of side and front-lit Sandhill cranes, the birds blend into the background, particularly in the magic hours light when everything is bathed by the low sun in the same ruddy glow.  The better bird photographers saturate their pictures with color.  This book's range of light seems particularly small.  Moreover, even though there are exceptions to the rule, bird pictures look more attractive when the natural light reveals a bird's face, rather than lighting its rump and leaving its face in shadow.<br />Another problem with the book is the sameness of the pictures.  After a dozen shots of front-lit snow geese or back-lit cranes, the pictures get repetitious.  Although the book presents about a dozen different bird species, Bosque has dozens on hand that the author has not presented to us.<br />Perhaps some of these problems are due to the equipment that the photographer used, although no technical data is presented to help us know.  Or maybe the problem is that the author only allowed himself four days to photograph a place that other photographers return to time and again, to explore its full potentialities.<br />As a souvenir of a great bird-watching hot spot, this book has a useful place, but it falls short of being an example of the vision that great bird photography can present.ump and leaving its face in shadow.<br />Another problem with the book is the sameness of the pictures.

It covers the period from 1959 to 1973, the years of manufacture of the camera that changed the way pictures were made. Volume 1 deals with the Nikon F in great detail, describing each part of the camera body and the way that the camera evolved over the period of manufacture. The second volume deals with the lenses that were made during this same period for the Nikon F, and the third volume with the accessories that were available for the camera.<br />As I read through the first book, with its listing of the years that variations to the basic camera were introduced, with related serial numbers, I recalled that up on the top shelf of a closet, my original Nikon F, purchased in 1961, was packed away. I stopped reading and pulled down the box from the shelf. There it was, Serial Number 6420249, manufactured, according to the author, Uli Koch, in the summer of 1960. I read through the sections on the frame counter, and the shutter speed indicator and the film rewind, carefully checking each description against my shiny old chrome-plated friend. At last I understood the cryptic marking &quot;EP&quot; on the rewind knob that meant the camera had been produced for sale in the Post Exchange, where I had purchased the camera.<br />When I got to the section on lenses, not only did I find the production data on my 50mm, 28mm and 135mm lenses, but I also found the description of the 85-250mm zoom, the lens that my heart had ached for, but that I could never afford. And there was the 300mm lens that I had bought second hand when a stroke of good fortune in my career brought me a sum of money that I didn't have to carefully budget for the uses of my young family.<br />When I got to the section on the clip-on external selenium exposure meter that I bought for my camera, the one that had broken and never been replaced, I found how difficult it was to remember the layout of the parts from more than 40 years ago, so that I could not recall if it had been a Model 1 or a Model 3. The description of the FTN Photomic finder, that introduced through-the-lens metering, reminded me of the break-through that I had with a difficult boss. Somehow, we talked about our cameras and learned that we both owned F's. He told me how wonderful through-the-lens metering was; I bought the FTN and found new joy in photography; and I found a new friend with whom I could share that joy.<br />Undoubtedly, these books are aimed at serious collectors of a single model of a camera, and they will relish the small details that are contained in these books, including stories about how Nikon developed certain equipment for the Tokyo Olympics and of the battles of Nippon Kogako in Germany that forced the company to market its products in that country with the Nikkor label instead of the Nikon label. One may wonder if the author finds it so incredible that a company in the only country to have had not one but two atomic bombs dropped on it should call a metering system &quot;Photomic&quot;,so that, he suggests, the derivation is from the combination of photo and automatic. One can laugh good naturedly at the sometimes-awkward translation of the text from its original German to English.<br />On the other hand, some can look upon these volumes as a chance to become reacquainted with a friend of more than forty years. When I finished reading the book, I pulled out the old carousels of my first Nikon years, and ran the projector, and wondered what had happened to so many of the people whose images I'd saved on film and in the recesses of my mind. As I read the books I vowed to find batteries for the FTN finder and take my Nikon F out one more time. At the same time, I knew that the day when I would have something to photograph and would forgo the chance of getting the kind of picture that my current cameras can capture so surely and easily would probably never come.<br />And yet, as I looked at what was perhaps the first picture I ever shot with a camera labeled Nikon, I thought of those almost-lost years fondly and appreciated Koch's work.obably never come.<br />And yet, as I looked at what was perhaps the first picture I ever shot with a camera labeled Nikon, I thought of those almost-lost years fondly and appreciated Koch's work.	2004-03-10

In a word, yes.  But the larger question inevitably raised by this book is, do you need SilverFast software?<br />SilverFast AI is software that allows photos digitized with a variety of different scanners, including flat bed scanners and negative scanners, to be manipulated as to their color content in the scanning process.  The software may either come installed with your machine or provided by the manufacturer or may be purchased separately as an after-market item.  The software allows for color correction while scanning a picture in a manner similar to that provided by the standard program for manipulation of digital images, PhotoShop, for images that have already been digitized.  SilverFast allows for setting levels, adjusting tone curves and changing hue and saturation in a manner that parallels PhotoShop.  It is designed to pass the corrected image on to PhotoShop in a machine-readable form.<br />Unfortunately the documentation that comes with SilverFast is presented as a computer file that could most charitably be called difficult to follow.  Tally provides a clear, narrative description of the process for using SilverFast AI, as well as several related products, that embodies the current digital photography buzzword, workflow.  Follow his clearly written instructions and you will proceed in an orderly manner to color correct your photographs, either for individual pictures or for batch processing.  This is not to say that Tally's instructions are comprehensive.  For example, although the SilverFast software that I use with my scanner provides for three different methods for focusing, Tally gives no guidance regarding focusing.<br />The publication itself doesn't consider reader convenience.  All of the color plates are located together on some central pages while black and white illustrations are located with the text about the operation being described.  This leads to a lot of page flipping that seems particularly inappropriate for a text, one of whose main purposes is to describe color correction.  But if you want to use SilverFast, this is as good as it gets.<br />Do you need SilverFast?  Tally says yes, because doing color correction in the scanning process results in the least loss of information in the image.  Another expert suggests that significant manipulation in scanning is impossible because of the low grade of the pre-scan.  My own belief is that with certain difficult scans (say, a white swan against a dark background) pre-scanning manipulation will capture some data that otherwise might be lost.  However, in this day, when the current version of PhotoShop provides far more data depth than most printers can use, this is probably less important.<br />So, do you need SilverFast?  Well, if your scanner came with it, or some other software that allows pre-scanning manipulation, of course you should use it.  I'm not certain most photographers will benefit from paying extra hundreds of dollars to purchase it.<br />On the other hand, if you have SilverFast, you must have this book.

In this book, Art Wolfe once again proves that Adams was wrong.<br />Wolfe presents us with landscapes from all over the world, from places where few us will ever travel, that are spectacular.  Many of the pictures, particularly those of rugged mountains, will leave the reader in awe of the natural landscape.<br />But Wolfe is not just concerned with the subject matter.  He never forgets the qualities of light and color.  Most of his shots are from the &quot;magic hours&quot; of sunrise and sunset when the sky is diffused with the range of colors from intense blues to bright reds.  Yet,while the mountains that form the backdrop for the lighting effects bask in the red glow, the foregrounds are frequently plunged into darkness, creating feelings of both repose and mystery.<br />The pictures are arranged into five chapters called Desert, Ocean, Mountain, Forest and Polar, but these subjects often creep from one chapter into another.  What is more interesting is when Wolfe presents a series of pictures, often on facing pages, that look at the same subject in different light, or different subjects in the same light.  This allows us to explore the subtle differences between the pictures and come to a deeper understanding of Wolfe?s art and the subject.<br />Technical data and Wolfe's commentary on the circumstances of the taking of each picture are in the back of the book, where they do not detract from the optical feast, but are available to those who may be interested in these details.<br />Beginning each chapter is a short essay by Art Davidson that is well written and has some relationship to the subsequent photographs.  Such essays have become mandatory but, like the ones in this book, they often seem to have a life of their own that does not really illuminate the pictures.  Perhaps I?m asking too much, but I have the example of photographer Galen Rowell?s book &quot;Alaska: Images of the Country&quot; in which Rowell quoted selected passages from author John McPhee?s book &quot;Coming into the Country&quot; to give us a strong but intimate view of that place.<br />Speaking of Rowell, one of his most famous books was &quot;Mountain Light&quot; where he showed photographers how to capture mountains in their distinctive illunination.  I don?t know if Wolfe studied Rowell, but if he did, he has surpassed his teacher.<br />One of the book's strong points may also be its weakness for some readers.  Wolfe often shows a photograph of a mountain backdrop bathed in magic-hours light, with a body of water in the foreground reflecting the mountains and concealed in shadow.  While some viewers will take the opportunity to compare these similar pictures to explore Wolfe's style and subject, others will find them too repetitious.<br />I also have to say a word about environmentalism, and here I know some people may react to my criticism apart from the book.  Wolfe has said that he put this book together to underscore the importance of preserving the wild places he has photographed.  Introductions by Robert Redford and John Adams, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, reemphasize the point.  Then Davidson's strident essays speak almost exclusively of man's efforts to dismember the landscape.  These photographs are so eloquent that I see no necessity for adding a stream of text to distract us from the pictures, each of which is truly worth 10,000 words.<br />Despite these criticisms I do not believe anyone who looks into the book will be unmoved or feel that they could better have spent their time.ch essays have become mandatory but, like the ones in this book, they often seem to have a life of their own that does not really illuminate the pictures.

US	53044678	R3S2CTAXX1LLM5	1584281146	639979156	The Master Guide for Wildlife Photographers	Books	5	34	34	N	N	A Good Introduction to Wildlife Photography	The late Bill Silliker, who wrote this book, was famous for his pictures of moose and loons.  In fact he loved to be called the Mooseman.  The Mooseman?s last book is an introduction to wildlife photography, aimed primarily at the beginning and intermediate photographer, although there are a few discussions that may cause the advanced wildlife photographer to reconsider his techniques.<br />The book, written in simple, direct, clear style, describes the fundamentals to be applied to get good wildlife pictures.  After the required discussion of equipment (Silliker prefers 35mm single-lens reflex cameras, long telephotos, autofocus and sturdy tripods), he spends a quarter of the book discussing metering and focussing techniques for wildlife in clear, comprehensive language.  The length of this discussion surprised me, but it is all relevant.  He then goes on to consider how to get close enough to animals to get pictures with impact, and composition.  I was delighted by his no-nonsense approach.  Stories about his own exploits are told only when essential to make a point.  There is no excess verbiage here.<br />My only complaint about the book is that I wanted a little more.  (Having read the author?s magazine columns, I know that he was a thoughtful photographer.)  For example, he believes that the limited depth of field of telephoto lenses is something that a photographer has to live with and he suggests ways to compensate for the fact.  I would have liked to hear some further discussion of the role that faster ISO media can play in getting greater depth of field, or the fact that for a particular image size and aperture depth of field will always be the same, regardless of lens length.  But, of course, that would have been a different book.<br />Silliker also does not dwell upon the use of digital imagery, although he acknowledges it and suggests several other books for the reader who wants to pursue that direction.<br />If you are just getting into wildlife photography, you won?t find a better guide than this.  The more advanced photographer may find his thinking stimulated by some of the discussions, but will probably want to explore other works to develop his skills.  There are many such works aimed at more advanced photographers, but I would certainly recommend the work of Art Morris and Art Wolfe, both of whom have turned wildlife photography into an art (pun intended but very true.)aphy, you won?t find a better guide than this.

Peterson, a famous wildlife photographer, expresses his opinions on what it takes to get good and great wildlife pictures.<br /><br />The first third of the book is dedicated to explaining what equipment is necessary for taking wildlife pictures.  It is clear that the author considers a camera capable of accepting a wide variety of lenses,  and some really long (and expensive) lenses, essential for this purpose.<br /><br />The next chapter of the book is devoted to techniques he considers necessary to make a picture \\"pop\\", i.e., attract a viewer's attention.  He discusses lighting, color, exposure and backgrounds.  The third section of the book talks about getting close to wildlife subjects and the fourth chapter looks at ten pictures of birds and describes the circumstances surrounding their taking, and the fifth chapter does the same with pictures of mammals.<br /><br />I imagine that reading this book would be much like sitting around with Moose in a bull session and talking about wildlife photography, with all the advantages and disadvantages that might include.  For a written work this book needed a good editor, not only to correct grammatical errors and typos, but also to correct all the repetitions, contradictory advice and non-sequiturs.  Also, notwithstanding statements to the contrary, Peterson is clearly biased in favor of digital photography with Nikon cameras.  For example, the title suggests that the book is applicable to both digital and film, but Moose spends 8 pages laying out why he believes digital photography is better than film,  He also spends a page describing why he prefers a particular Nikon lens over others, even though the features on which he bases his preference are only available from Nikon.  On the other hand, in discussing the advantages of digital he makes no mention of the use of the histogram, a feature that several other wildlife photographers consider to be the most important benefit of digital cameras.<br /><br />At the same time some of the material isn't presented by any other author in this detail.  The twenty-nine pages devoted to getting close to the quarry are singular.  While the chapters on the author's pictures may contain a lot of details that will be of little use to most folks, they do convey the importance of planning and patience in wildlife photography.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that will teach you fundamentals, like the nature of exposure, look at something else, like John Shaw's \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\" or Art Morris' \\"the Art of Bird Photography\\".  But if you are an experienced photographer, looking to glean a few tips about wildlife photography that you may not have heard before, and willing to put up with a rough and ready but expert photographer, you will probably enjoy this book.a feature that several other wildlife photographers consider to be the most important benefit of digital cameras.

The author covers the process from taking the picture to manipulating the image in the computer.  More advanced photographers should look elsewhere.<br />The book is divided into chapters first dealing with photography principles, like light and color, and then into chapters dealing with specific subjects, like sunrise and sunset.  Each chapter is then broken up into subheadings, each of which gets a page or two.  The author has tried to keep the information and guidance general so that it can be helpful to all digital camera users.  The material is easily read.  Unfortunately, his approach often creates broad generalizations that are of little use.<br />Unlike film, where, after taking a picture, the medium can be brought to a photofinisher who will finish the job of creating a paper image or slide, digital media usually require some sort of downloading from the camera to a computer, and then a printer.  While this process can be very simple for the user, (it's possible to download your pictures right to a printer, although to get the most from the digital process, some manipulation is usually desirable).  The author recognizes this by showing a couple of before and after images that he has manipulated with Photoshop software.  Unfortunately, in this chapter, he goes into a level of technical detail far beyond that contained elsewhere in the volume that only someone trained in Photoshop will understand. .  In addition, I think the author may leave the impression that Photoshop's main use is altering reality.  While that is one use, I consider the program to be designed to allow you to make a photograph look the way you envisioned it at the time you took the picture.<br />A problem with the approach Cox takes is that anyone interested in the control that digital photography provides over the image will be unsatisfied.  For example, many digital cameras provide histograms of the picture taken.  (Histograms are graphic representations of the distribution of light values in a picture.)  The histogram is perhaps the single most potent tool offered by the digital photography, allowing photographers to insure they got the best exposure possible for their vision.  Yet there is not one reference to histograms in the entire volume<br />In summary, if you are a beginner, interested in taking digital nature pictures, but not ready to immerse yourself too deeply in the technology, this will be a fine book for you.<br />For those who want to delve more deeply, I can't recommend a single book.  On the general topic of nature photography, John Shaw's \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\" is outstanding, although there is no consideration of digital procedures.  To examine what makes digital photography different from film photography and how to capitalize on the differences, I recommend \\"Shooting Digital: Pro Tips for Taking Great Pictures with Your Digital Camera\\" by Mikkel Aaland (although I'm sure there are even better volumes out there with which I'm not familiar).  Finally, for learning Photoshop I recommend \\"Photoshop Artistry\\" by Barry Haynes.  This last provides a series of tutorials on Photoshop aimed specifically at photographers.  It will take a while to work through but there's really no quick way to learn this most important piece of software for the digital photographer.meras provide histograms of the picture taken.

If you find a recipe that fills a need that you have, the book will be a good investment.  But if you are looking for an overall approach to using Photoshop this is not the book for you.<br />Right from the first chapter, with his discussion of ways to use the Photoshop browser, you make pick up another way of dealing with a Photoshop function that you didn't know about.  On the other hand, some of the material will be old hat to an experienced Photoshop user.<br />Some of the techniques, like color correction of digital images, will appeal to almost any Photoshop user.  Those who have philosophical questions about what I call montage may not be interested in chapters on removing the wrinkles in an elderly person's portrait or removing the love handles from a slightly overgrown physique.  On the other hand, these certainly are bread and butter issues to some photographers.<br />Kelby's method of holding your attention is by making a number of breezy wise cracks as you go through the book.  For example he says in the chapter on masking techniques \\"If I were elected President, one of my first priorities would be to sign an executive order requiring all registered voters to carry with them a white seamless role at all times\\"  He then goes on to speculate how easy this would make Photoshop selection.  That stylistic gadget may make you laugh the first time you encounter it, but after the 50th encounter you want to tell the author to take a break.<br />The title of this book might lead you to believe that this book would start at the beginning of the photographic process, when an image is being captured in a digital camera.  If the book didn't intend to cover this, why say it's for \\"digital photographers\\"?  After all, every picture manipulated in Photoshop is digital - it has to be to get into Photoshop - but it could have come from a photo-cd or a scanner.  But this book starts when the photo is already in the camera.<br />I got very interested when I saw that there was a section of the book on Photoshop's Camera RAW plug-in.  But all Kelby gives you is a rehash of the information that Adobe provides you with the RAW software with a lower level of detail.  You get no help on how to use that software to make a better picture.<br />I occasionally think Kelby takes a more complex approach to a problem than one needs.  His section on \\"Color Correcting Digital Images\\" advises setting the tonal highlight, shadow and midpoint with the curves function, but most users would probably find it easier to do this with the levels function<br />There is no magic bullet that will help someone learn the fundamentals of Photoshop.  The new user is best served by sitting down with a book of tutorials, either like those provided by Adobe or like Photoshop 7 Artistry by Barry Haynes, and working through the exercises.  After that you can come back to this book and get a few tips in using the Photoshop functions that you know.digital - it has to be to get into Photoshop - but it could have come from a photo-cd or a scanner.

The authors start out with what they call the \\"basics\\": cameras, lenses, composition, light, exposure and other building blocks of good pictures.  They then present a \\"World of Subjects\\", that is, a look at pictures by content.  After talking about \\"Making Pictures under Pressure\\", they finish up with a brief section on computers and photography.<br />The chapters on the basics are both highly simplified and boringly detailed.  At the same time they leave out critical information about the basics.  For example, in the chapter on film, they spend a few pages discussing the difference between \\"pro\\" films and amateur films without saying very much except that there may be a difference.  For the average photographer, who may be unable to find pro films in his local outlet, this certainly doesn't merit the lengthy discussion.  However, the comparison of slide films and print films leaves out any mention of the wider exposure latitude of print films.  The fact that print films can take in a greater range of light, so that bright tones are not burnt out, while shadows show detail, is an important consideration for many serious photographers.<br />I suppose the discussions of subject matters might prove helpful for an inexperienced photographer going out to shot a new kind of subject, but many of the specialty books dealing with subject matter will prove far more helpful.<br />This book advertises itself on the cover as \\"Revised &amp; Updated with the latest in digital technology\\" but there is no mention of digital cameras until almost the last thirty pages of the book.  Given that digital cameras now make up close to half of all camera sales, this is ludicrous.  It feels like the chapter was added when someone suggested that something had to be said about digital photography.  My litmus test for whether a book deals adequately with serious digital photography is the handling of white balance.  This book makes no mention of it.<br />But my biggest complaint about this book is that after discussing the details and the subjects, the authors never really tell you how to make the transition from equipment and technique to taking pictures.  Serious photography involves capturing a photographer's vision (which can be as simple as recording how cheery Aunt Tillie is or as weighty as considering the destruction of the environment).  All the technique must be tied to this goal.  The authors never get there.<br />As a general introduction to serious photography, this volume falls short in several areas.  On the other hand, it might prove an occasional useful reference.  I haven't read many comprehensive introductory photography guides lately.

For any camera more complex than a point and shoot, a photographer will have to learn about a host of technical differences that effect the ultimate photograph, like white balance, histograms and file formats.  Yet these same challenges also offer opportunities for new and creative uses that film doesn't provide.<br />Aaland aims his book at new converts to digital by explaining how digital differs from film.  After a brief introduction to the subject, and the differences between the media, he offers individual chapters on shooting situations that explain how to shot pictures digitally.  Chapters deal with portraiture, action and landscapes, among other genres.  He uses case studies of particular photographs to show how the photographers adjusted their shooting technique to fit the requirements of digital cameras.  I found these examples to be particularly helpful for understanding how I would have to change my shooting habits for digital.  There is necessarily some overlap with the general techniques of photography, as when the author discusses lighting techniques for digital portraits.  It's comforting to know that there is not much difference in this area between film and digital.  On the other hand some of the advice is remarkably banal, as when he describes the &quot;rule of thirds&quot; and then tells you that you should develop composition skills on your own.<br />There are a few chapters in this book that are so peripheral to the theme of the book, but written about with such detail, that they seemed to me to be added as filler.  For example, Aaland includes ten pages on object movies that seemed of little use to the average photographer.  (Object movies are a series of digital photographs of an object, stitched together so that they can be presented on a computer as if one was circling the object.  Their primary use is in advertising.)<br />Yet despite these failings, this book certainly eased the transition from film to digital for me.  I wish that the author had spent more time using more genres as examples of the shifts required for the change but the book did the job I expected it to do,for me.

Davies offers his ideas and pictures in a series of two page spreads.  Some of these deal with particular families of flowers and environments and others with particular techniques applicable to flower photography.  The book is profusely illustrated with the author's photos.<br />There is probably a great deal of useful information here but its presentation is rather haphazard.  The headings of each section don't give much help since they don't appear to have any organizing principle.  Then, useful information may be buried deep within a paragraph dealing with an unlikely topic.  There is a technical appendix that contains short, concise discussions of technical issues, but makes no reference to any photos.  There is also a section on image manipulation that covers digital processing, with emphasis on the use of Photoshop, but this section is too brief to be of any practical use.<br />I prefer a more organized approach to a subject.  This helps the photographer to form a checklist in his own mind.  For example most books on a genre of photography include a section on composition.  Davies sprinkles little composition rules throughout the book but in a manner that does not contribute to a comprehensive approach to composition.<br />Sometimes the author gives apparently contradictory advice, often within the same paragraph.  For example in a discussion of berries he suggests using both a mid-range zoom lens and a wide-angle lens for photos, offering instances where each would be appropriate.  But the photos he includes to illustrate the different length lenses appear to be much the same.<br />Another weakness is that he doesn't deal at all with some major problems of flower photography.  For example, one of the major problems of photographing flowers in a natural environment is movement created by the wind.  There are methods that can be used to deal with this factor, but none of them are covered by the author.<br />Although not aimed exclusively at flower photographers, I found John Shaw's \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\" to be far more useful.  In a dozen pages on close up photography Shaw covers more ground than this entire book.<br />If you are prepared to go through this book slowly, perhaps making notes as you go, and carefully studying the many flower pictures offered by Davies, you may find this book useful.

Names like Iwago, Lanting, Mangelsen, Morris and Wolfe will be quite familiar to people interested in this genre.<br />Each artist gets four pages for some biographical data and several pictures.  Every one of the photos is world class.<br />While the biographies are generally too short to provide much insight into the individual artists, one can discern a couple of trends in their lives.  A good many started life in some other career and after a while decided to make the risky jump to professional wildlife photography.  Others were interested in nature all of their life and the photography grew out of this love.  No one started life as a commercial or fashion photographer and then made the switch to wildlife.  Occasionally a photographer will offer a surprising statement about the commercial nature of wildlife photography, like the photographer who notes that the books he has published don't make financial sense, but do help to drum up other business.<br />As I've perused a number of wildlife photography books over the years, I've noticed that a good book is like a good piece of music.  As you proceed through it, you notice both the repetition and the variation of elements so that by the end of the book you have not just looked at pictures, but also come to understand something about the photographer and the way he relates to the animals he photographs.  This book is more like a CD my son owns, called &quot;50 Great Classical Hits&quot; (or something like that).  The CD plays just the most dramatic points from a number of symphonies.  While that can be interesting, it certainly doesn't provide the same experience as listening to a single full symphony.<br />This book has the same effect.  Many of the pictures are obviously well composed and striking but when one turns the page the picture one just looked at disappears from the mind as the reader tries to come to grips with a completely different subject and style.  Ultimately I found this beautiful book unsatisfying.<br />But, it does serve the very useful purpose of introducing you to wildlife photographers you may not have yet encountered.

It does this by describing a number of different techniques less commonly used by photographers that can be applied to photographic images.<br />The techniques explored range from the traditional like multiple exposure and toning to what some might consider more avant-garde, like photograms, which are images made on photo-sensitive media without a camera, and distressed images, that is, those deliberately subjected to destructive forces.  The authors recognize that the mechanics of photography are in flux and so refer to both chemical darkrooms and digital manipulation.<br />This is more of an idea book than a how-to book.  The descriptions of most of the techniques are cursory.  If one wanted to use a technique in connection with one's photography, one would probably have to do additional research.  In addition, the number of examples provided in the book is necessarily limited to about a half dozen for each technique.  For me, with the exception of some approaches of which I had already been thinking, that was not enough for me to see how I could apply the procedures to my own photography.<br />Of course, that may be a major problem with a catalogue of unusual procedures.  It is difficult, or perhaps impossible, to explain how to extend one's vision so that these techniques will prove useful.  I suspect that one must already have both a full understanding of, and a deep dissatisfaction with, the traditional techniques of photography as a method of expressing one's vision.  If that is true of a photographer, he or she is probably already thinking about how to change the form to express his or her vision.  In that case, this volume might provide a few useful ideas.	2003-08-12

Freeman Patterson has always been an important teacher who talks about the role of the photographer, rather than equipment, in creating photographic art.  Unfortunately, this book doesn't deliver on its premise or promise.<br />This book seems to have been made by joining together smaller pieces.  There are two short books here under one cover, one called &quot;Photo Impressionism&quot; and the other &quot;the Subjective Image&quot;.  Then each of these books is made up of relatively unrelated chapters, like the first which discusses the creating of multiple images of the same subject on the same frame of film by making multiple exposures and the second which discusses creating images by sandwiching two or more pieces of film together.  That the chapters are unrelated is made obvious by the fact that they are written by each author individually with no collaboration between the authors.<br />What one learns are a couple of techniques. One involves randomness in the creation of pictures that makes a mockery of the description of photo impressionism as a &quot;depiction...intended to achieve...a vividness or effectiveness....&quot;  Ansel Adams' teachings about the role of vision in photography have guided fine photography for many years.  Perhaps that has been an error in the conventional wisdom, but most serious photographers would deny any error.  Randomness is the antithesis of intention and vision.<br />Other than that, the book is a collection of trite advice like the fact that exposure and film are important to good photography!  A description of an author's trip to Morocco provides little guidance about photo-impressionism, and advice that a &quot;long chin or nose will appear shorter if you lower your camera position&quot; sounds very conventional.  What is amazingly lacking in a book released in the 21st century is any reference to the manipulation of images digitally.<br />However, the photographs in the book are beautiful, and one can see how the authors have tried to speak to our emotions.  At the same time many of even the best images appear to be quite conventional in approach.<br />Photography needs a good book on this subject that can tell serious camera wielders how to &quot;achieve a vividness or effectiveness more by invoking subjective and sensory impressions than by re-creating an objective reality&quot; (to quote the authors' paraphrase of the dictionary).  How can one look at a subject and see the potential for its image to be adjusted in a way that will tell the viewer something that could not be said if a mere record was made?  This book doesn't tell us that.  In fact Patterson's earlier &quot;Photography and the Art of Seeing&quot; does a better job.  Someone interested in seeing how one practitioner does this, along with the photographer's thoughts on individual pictures, would probably benefit more by reading Tony Sweet's &quot;Fine Art Nature Photography: Advanced Techniques and the Creative Process&quot;<br />In summary, nice pictures and weak words.s any reference to the manipulation of images digitally.<br />However, the photographs in the book are beautiful, and one can see how the authors have tried to speak to our emotions.

This book was displayed on the floor of Congress by a debating Senator who agreed with Banerjee.  Shortly thereafter the Smithsonian, which had scheduled a showing of Banerjee's pictures in the museum's main hall, moved the pictures to a far less desirable location and cut the captions to almost nothing.  Accusations of political tampering have been flying fast and furious since then.<br />There is little doubt that this is a book of advocacy.  From the introduction by President Jimmy Carter to essays by the Pulitzer Prize winning nature writer Peter Matheson and bird artist Allen Sibley, among others, the book makes a plea for preservation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, with particular note of strong attacks on the refuge by forces supporting the petroleum industry.<br />The various essays describing travels in the refuge will be of interest to those who enjoy reading about trips through the great outdoors, although you have to be ready for a big dose of anti-oil rhetoric.  However, I expect that no one who reads this book will be a strong supporter of the energy industry, so that much of the writing will be preaching to the converted.<br />I can be counted as supporting preservation of the refuge, and I'd love to give this book a high rating, but I thought there were far too many pages of essays and not enough pictures.  And, ultimately I think this book must be judged by the author's photographs.  Unfortunately the photos are of only of so-so quality.<br />Some of Banerjee's shots are spectacular, like those of herds of oxen against the midnight sun.  Others are as subtle as the textures of the refuge itself, like the pictures of lichens growing on rocks.  But most of the pictures are straight forward record shots with little sophistication.  They provide information but not inspiration.  Banerjee is not a great photographic artist.  If that's what you want get Art Wofe's book of highly saturated, incredibly composed photographs, \\"Alaska\\".  Wolfe's picture of a single Dall Sheep looks majestic.  Banerjee's looks, well, moth-eaten.  Banerjee's shot of a herd of Dall Sheep is a bunch of sheep in a green field.  Wolfe's is an environmental photo of a herd amongst precipitous mountains.<br />If you want a book dedicated exclusively to the refuge, and you want to show support for the refuge, and it's not important that you have great pictures to inspire you, you may want this book.

But if you are expecting a normal picture book about Alaska, this isn't it.  Instead this is a look at a place that is full of ambiguity.<br />The book is structured around John McPhee's book &quot;Coming into the Country&quot;.  In that book McPhee gives an insightful description of Alaska as a place, and its inhabitants.  The Alaskans seem torn between preserving the wilderness and developing it and the extracts contained in this volume capture that spirit.  For example, McPhee provides admiring character studies of a number of people who came to Alaska because they just didn't fit in back in the lower 48 states.  Even his descriptions of travels in the wilderness have an overlay of the politics of the state, where the federal government, which once owned most of the land, is distrusted by most citizens.<br />Rowell decided that he wanted to take McPhee's writing and illustrate it with his own pictures.  The preface makes clear that McPhee didn't offer a lot of cooperation.  In fact he warned Rowell not to overprint his verbal pictures with Rowell's.  The text selection was made by Rowell and the pictures included are not directly related to the words but have a close connection to their spirit.<br />As I noted, this is not any ordinary Rowell book (if there is such a thing).  There are far more pictures of human beings and their artifacts then one usually finds in such a book, and I sometimes felt that the pictures were gritty and dark.  At first I thought that this was a shortcoming of the photographs but then I realized that Rowell had specifically selected these pictures because he believed that they reflected the spirit of McPhee's words.  Oh, there are some grand landscapes like a picture of snow-covered Mount McKinley across isolated Nugget Pond, but there is also a picture of the same snow-covered peak taken across a dark, intruding asphalt highway into the wilderness.<br />The final pages capture the essence of this book.  McPhee describes the role of the 55 gallon steel drum in the Alaskan landscape, and tells how his view has gone from considering them ugly to finding them almost blooming.  Opposite these words Rowell has placed a picture of a long line of rusty drums curving sinuously out of the frame into the Arctic Ocean.<br />This book is more than 20 years old and the McPhee book almost 40 years old.  Alaska may have changed since then, although everything I've read about it recently makes me believe that the same forces are still at work out on this frontier.  But for a person interested in Alaska this book provides a feeling for the place and its people that has the ring of authenticity.<br />If you want to see Alaska as a work of art, then I would recommend Art Wolfe's recent book of photographs &quot;Alaska&quot;.

Seldom is there a discussion of the psychological and physiological aspects of the photographer and the viewer in the process of creating and looking at pictures.  This book attempts to fill that gap for photographers and other graphic artists with the aim of giving more impact to pictures created by those artists.<br /> The contents are wide ranging, with everything from a discussion of Gestalt psychology field grouping to a discussion of the meaning of the &quot;Kilroy was here&quot; signs that proliferated during and after the Second World War.<br /> Some of the material may be immediately useful to a photographer such as the discussion of figure and ground.  Thinking in these terms may make it easier for the photographer to decide how, or even if, he wants to provide separation to his subject.<br /> Other material will require a major mental engagement that could ultimately prove useful.  For example there is a lengthy discussion of the use of rhetoric in photography.  This will be a new concept for most photographers.  Zakia suggests that rhetoric deals with structuring the photograph to alter its message in a certain direction.  For example, the photographer can use the rhetorical device of identity to strengthen a picture through repetition.  That device should be easily understandable to most photographers.  On the other hand using dubitation for opposition (sic!) may leave the photographer wondering what the author is talking about.  However, a close reading might reveal that considering this approach may lead to a stronger picture.<br /> Finally there is material like the discussion of synesthesia, a situation where one experiences a sensual stimulus, like a sound, in another mode, like vision.  While interesting, I failed to see the relevance of this information to the practical photographer.<br /> And that is a major shortcoming of this book.  The author frequently fails to make a connection between a phenomenon that he is describing and photography.  To compound this shortcoming, when he offers a connection to a visual work as an illustration, he does not usually include the work in the book, but rather describes it in writing.  For a book on imaging, the failure to include images is shocking.<br /> I suppose there are photographers who are so skilled and so intellectual that they could benefit from this material.

Somewhere along the line between beginner and expert most photographers decide that they want to be more creative.  It is to this audience that Brenda Tharp had addressed her work.  But one question this book raises is whether you can teach someone to be creative.  The author believes the answer is yes, although she acknowledges that it takes a lot of work on the part of the photographer.<br />Tharp begins and ends the book by telling you that the secret to creativity is learning to see.  But as you go through the book some of the chapters on subjects like light and composition and perspective sound remarkably similar to a lot of other photography books that are concerned with technique rather than creativity.  Tharp's method is to give you a rule like &quot;simplify&quot; and then to tell you how to simplify.  She does this well and the pictures that she uses certainly show her creativity, but it's hard to make the connection between these rules and developing our creativity.<br />I wish she had spent more time on telling us how to see because I think she is on the right trail here.  But if you speed down the highway too quickly you might miss it, which would be a shame.  Assuming you can teach creativity, Tharp makes a decent try of it, providing the reader is willing to work at making the connections to seeing.<br />There are many approaches to teaching how to be photographically creative.  In &quot;Fine Art Nature Photography: Advanced Techniques and the Creative Process&quot; Tony Sweet presents us with a series of pictures and a narrative for each that explains what he was trying to achieve with the photograph and what techniques he used to achieve it.  In &quot;Creative Landscape Photography&quot;, Niall Benvie talks about the different subject matter one may encounter, like wilderness, and then talks about what that subject means to him and what techniques he uses to translate what he sees and feels into a photograph.  And my favorite photography book, &quot;Photography and the Art of Seeing&quot; by Freeman Paterson, in a very touchy-feely work, provides a number of unusual exercises that are designed to teach a photographer how to see.<br />None of these books actually teaches creativity (although for me, Paterson comes closest.)  Instead they show creative work and the considerations that the authors had in creating that work.  Whether any method works in developing creativity is an open question.  If it can be developed, which authors' approach will work best will depend on the individual reader.  A serious photographer will want to try them all until he or she finds one that works for him or her.  Tharp's book is certainly one that ought to be examined in this difficult search.;Photography and the Art of Seeing&quot; by Freeman Paterson, in a very touchy-feely work, provides a number of unusual exercises that are designed to teach a photographer how to see.<br />None of these books actually teaches creativity (although for me, Paterson comes closest.)

At first glance this looks like an ideal book for someone who is moving from the point-and-shoot stage of photography to something beyond snapshots.  Everything most people want to know about photography from the relationships of f-stops, shutter speed and film speed all the way to underwater photography is in this book.  Unfortunately the book throws the information at you so quickly and with so little discussion and few examples of applications that you may miss some very important concepts and confuse others.<br />It would be nice to think that a person could improve his or her photography without a lot of effort, but that just isn't so.  It's not enough to have a new rule thrown at you.  Most people need photography principles to be explained, usually in several different ways, with plenty of examples.  You'd expect lots of pictures to be used to illustrate points.  After all, this is about photography.  But that is not the approach taken by this book.  The principles are stated, and later in the book, restated, but not illustrated well.<br />It's really a shame, because this book is small enough to carry with you in case you want to check on something in the field.  Art Wolfe, whose pictures appear throughout the book, is one of the great outdoor photographers (Gardner's pictures also appear to a lesser extent, but they aren't in the same league as Wolfe's.).  Unfortunately the pictures aren't tied to the teaching points very strongly.  That's a shame because stronger ties to Wolfe's pictures could really teach one about outdoor photography.<br />The book gives a nod to incorporating digital photography, but only in the most rudimentary fashion.  For example, I consider an understanding of \\"white balance\\" to be essential for a serious digital photographer, but this book just barely acknowledges that there is such a thing.<br />There are several mistakes in this book.  A chart on page 83 suggesting exposure guidelines for low-light photography captions a column ISO 50 (film speed) when it means ISO 400.  Follow these guidelines and your picture will be hopelessly underexposed.<br />The author discusses pushing film.  This process involves setting your camera as if the film you are using is more sensitive than it really is and then asking your lab to develop the film in a way that will make it that sensitive.  The author says that pushed film is less grainy then film with a higher rating shot and developed normally.  It's not true.  If it were, all we'd ever need is one speed of film.<br />If I absolutely needed a guide that would fit in my pocket in the field I'd consider this book.  Otherwise I'd buy a book like John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide.  It's physically bigger, but will be more effective in improving your outdoor photography.ISO 50 (film speed) when it means ISO 400.

But having finished it, I'm planning my trip!<br />But I can say this is a great book of photographs of nature.  Anyone who loves to look at photographs will love this book.  Wolfe demonstrates that he is one of the greatest living outdoor photographers.  His sense of light and composition is unexcelled.  Almost every picture has a strong sense of line, either vertical, horizontal or diagonal.  And the range of light is exceptional, often including in the same picture the darkest blacks and the brightest whites.<br />The handling of sky is as sublime as that of any of the 19th century American landscape painters.  I'm certain that there must be plain blue skies in Alaska but every one of Wolfe's skies has clouds that are fleecy, or glowering, or mysterious.  And the light that falls on the landscapes illuminates them with a strange beauty whether casting deep, hard-edged shadows that make a rugged peak look even more majestic; or soft shadows that fall across a brush-covered hillside and create a subtle modulation of green; or the red rays of the magic hours of dawn and dusk.<br />Occasionally his pictures take on a strange abstraction that requires a careful examination to discover what one is looking at, like the pictures of white ice floes on the surface of an inky-black river or the network of crevasses on a glacier with a few spots of emerald blue in the white field, where the snow has melted into a pond reflecting the sky.<br />Wolfe is a master of color field photography.  Consider the brownish, grayish web of fine lines with several smears of white across it that resolves into a portrait of musk oxen with white horns and muzzles.  Or the white arctic foxes in the snow with a bare hint of orange on their undersides.  Or the receding green hillsides distinguished only by differing textures with a tiny browsing caribou in the foreground.<br />The text by Nick Jans is sometimes overly poetic and almost unnecessary given the photographs although explaining just what it is that makes tundra tundra has some interest.  However when I turn the page to see just the top halves of the heads of two fierce little owls peeking at me with yellow eyes hidden amongst a row of wildflowers in the Arctic Wild Life Refuge, words disappear from my mind.<br />Most people agree that Alaska is one of the last great wildernesses and that we are unlikely to see anything more exciting in our lives.  Art Wolfe has captured the excitement of Alaska.  He has also captured the excitement of great photography.oreground.<br />The text by Nick Jans is sometimes overly poetic and almost unnecessary given the photographs although explaining just what it is that makes tundra tundra has some interest.

Each picture is accompanied by a description of the circumstances under which the picture was taken.  There is also a smaller picture taken of the same subject or at the same time that is contrasted with the larger photograph.<br />The photographer is clearly concerned with light in the landscape.  Many pictures show the red glow of \\"magic hours\\" or reflections of water, or cloudy skies.  Cornish's photographs are lovely, but there is nothing outstanding about them.  Once upon a time this book might have been at the cutting edge.  But we now live in a world where first-class landscapes are offered to us in every automobile advertisement so that to capture our eye, an image must be exceptional.<br />Nor is there any common theme among the landscapes that might lead you to look at them because you have an interest in the subject matter.  I would have felt proud to have taken any of these pictures.  However, I wouldn't expect many people to lay out good money for such a book when there are so many other outstanding works by world class photographers, unless they already owned everything by Ansel Adams or Galen Rowell or Art Wolfe.<br />I must confess that this book was not what I expected.  The publisher, Amphoto Books, usually puts out \\"how-to\\" books, and I expected something like Galen Rowell's \\"Mountain Light\\" that would deal with using light to create better pictures while at the same time presenting a great portfolio.  I am certain most serious landscape photographers would be highly interested in a new book on this subject.  But the only way you are going to learn anything from this book is by analyzing each picture yourself at great length, and extracting some photographic principle from your analysis.  To be fair, technical information is provided on each picture and the accompanying discussions occasionally present a few of the considerations in using light in landscapes, like the effect of long exposures and the special results of early morning and late day light.  Unfortunately I don't find this information very educational for either the beginner or the more experienced photographer.  For the beginner, I would recommend either John Shaw's \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\" or his \\"Landscape Photography\\" (the former was recently printed and reflects the changes in technology of the last few years, but does not have quite as much detail about landscapes).  The more experienced photographer will be more interested in \\"Fine Art Nature Photography: Advanced Techniques and the Creative Process\\" by Tony Sweet.

Many of us decide at that time that we want to use ready-made frames and mats, even though a custom frame or mat might enhance the presentation of the art even more.  A few folks then take the big step of buying a mat knife and straight edge and cutting their own mats.<br />This book is aimed at people who want to go a step beyond cutting simple mats, although enough tips are offered on that subject so that even experienced mat cutters can learn something new.  The book is designed to appeal to a wide audience from beginners to those who are considering constructing their own frames from scratch.  It does it by simple, direct explanation, and you probably will find it sitting on your work table, like a recipe book, while you frame pictures.  There's little art here.  For example, the discussion of mat color selection makes it clear that this is a matter that is very personal, and about which the author can only provide the most general guidance.<br />On the other hand there's plenty of craft.  For example, he discusses the variety of tools available and suggests which are worth investing in for the work that one contemplates.  He suggested at least one tool that I did not know existed to deal with a problem I regularly encountered.<br />A typical example of the more complex tasks covered is the preparation of a double mat, that is, two mats stacked together so that the overmat has a larger window than the undermat.  Trying to cut the windows separately will almost always lead to an uneven looking window.  Logan tells you how to manipulate the two mats together so that the mats will nest evenly.  Not brain surgery, but a useful technique.<br />Logan also spends some time debunking myths, like the supposed danger of using non-museum quality mats.  He points out that not only have ordinary matboards improved with regard to the effects of acid content, but that it also makes no economic sense to use materials that will last longer than the framed object.<br />The book has a few weaknesses.

Douglas Allen Box provides a good, serviceable manual that should improve the quality of the average photographer's portraits.<br />The author's approach is to present a portrait and then explain the photographic considerations that went into it. Usually he provides an overhead diagram showing the relationship of camera, subject and light.  With each picture a short description of lighting, photography and background is usually included.  Some portraits have been selected because they presented special situations or techniques. For these, besides the trio mentioned, he offers a short discussion of the problem and how he solved it. For example a portrait featuring &quot;head tilt&quot; discussed what Box calls the C pose and the relationship of a tilted head to lighting.<br />When you've finished this book you will know how to look for that soft, indirect lighting that usually makes for attractive portraits.  That may not sound like much, but it is probably the most important single factor for a good portrait.  You will also have encountered a number of tips that will make your portraits better looking that you might not encounter elsewhere.  For example, I had never read that having people in a group portrait dress in similar clothing would create of feeling of unity.  And yet putting both members of a couple in white shirts and khaki pants can achieve that goal.<br />I have some nits to pick with the author. Box is a medium format guy and doesn't mention auto-exposure. Since most photographers are now using 35mm cameras with auto exposure, a little tailoring could have helped, but this shortcoming is not fatal.  And he preserves a few photography myths, like the suggestion that a longer focal length lens creates a shorter depth of field. Optical science is clear that for the same image size on a negative, the only way to change the depth of field around a subject is by changing aperture.<br />Reading this book and following the author's advice will not make you into a Karsh or Avedon.  Not only did those photographers create their portraits in the studio with special lights, but they also had some of the most photogenic faces in the world to work with, as well as a degree of talent that was (and is) exceptional.  This book is aimed at the majority of us who will take our cameras outdoors to photograph friends and family and who will be happy if the result is a picture that will lead others to say &quot;Doesn't Jim (or Jane) look great in this picture.epth of field around a subject is by changing aperture.<br />Reading this book and following the author's advice will not make you into a Karsh or Avedon.

But even after going through the arcane tricks of &quot;levels&quot; and &quot;curves&quot; they sometimes have difficulty transforming what they see on their monitor to what comes out of their printer.  Even more committed digital photographers wonder if there are alternate ways to use the technology to create art.  This book is aimed at the audience of advanced Photoshop users.<br />This is not a tutorial for photographers to learn Photoshop.  For that I recommend &quot;Photoshop 7 Artistry by Barry Haynes&quot;.  Instead, this book is aimed at what happens when a file manipulated in Photoshop gets sent to the printer.<br />The section that I believe will be of most interest deals with printer color management.  Photoshop users want to insure that what they see on their monitor will be what they get on their printer.  Most Photoshop books discuss using Adobe Gamma to adjust a monitor but few give the details of calibrating a printer.  In just 8 pages Daly tells exactly how to set up a profile for your printer so that your monitor and printer will match up.  That alone makes this book worth the price.<br />For photographers interested in going beyond sending the command to print a photo, this book will offer a number of ideas.  Some will be quite practical, like a discussion of monochrome printing techniques, or instructions on how to make a CD cover for the CDR on which you might save a photo file.  Some will be of interest to the photographer looking to push his work into a more artful stage, like a discussion of how to create a rough-edged negative border around a print.  And some will serve to remind us of just how far we can push our photographic art, like discussions of overprinting old manuscripts or creating a hand-bound book of photographs.<br />The book is not without fault.  The discussion of custom printing modes is much too cursory.  And even though printed in 2002, the book only refers to the 6.0 version of Photoshop.  On the other hand, given the general nature of the discussions, in most cases, this is not a serious limitation.<br />If you are not interested in tinkering with your computer to get a better digital photograph, this book isn't for you.  But for the Photoshop user who wants to get more out of his or her printer, this book focuses on that task more clearly and concisely than any other I've encountered.ting modes is much too cursory.

Ang's \\"Tao of Photography\\" is apparently aimed at such a photographer.  Unfortunately his aim isn't very good.<br />The title of this book suggests that by examining the ancient Asian philosophy, Tao (often translated as \\"the Way\\"), and incorporating it into one's photographic approach, one will open new doorways to creativity.  The suggestion is not unreasonable since many of the great photographers of the world have suggested adopting photographic approaches that sound remarkably like the Tao.<br />Unfortunately Ang never really explores many facets of Taoism other then Yin and Yang, a principle that suggests that there are two possible approaches to almost everything in life and that the wise person threads his way between to follow the Way.  And even when he refers to this dualism, it is only to suggest that it exists.  I would have hoped that he would show us sign posts for the Way.  For example he notes that there is a relationship between film speed and film grain, i.e., faster films are usually grainier.  But how we are to transform that knowledge into creativity is not suggested, or at least, not usefully.<br />Moreover, the book doesn't seem to be well organized or sure of its audience.  Ideas and sections appear thrown together randomly, as if from a stream of consciousness.  And the ideas may apply to a beginning photographer or an advanced photographer.  For example a comparison of range finder cameras to single lens reflexes would be old hat to an advanced photographer, while a discussion of the curves function in Photoshop seems designed to scare the beginner.<br />I found particularly disturbing a number of sections of the book that Ang calls workshops.  I expected some kind of exercises here but instead encountered a few more hackneyed aphorisms like \\"The Tao photographer sees opportunities but does not force results\\" and \\"The Tao photographer understands that being awake means knowing when to sleep\\".<br />The Tao is not about technique, it is about philosophy.  If you want a book that suggests how the Tao can be incorporated into your photography read \\"The Tao of Photography: Seeing beyond Seeing\\" by Philippe L. Gross and S.I. Shapiro.  On the other hand if you don't want to consider changing your way of living but want to work on your creativity read \\"Photography and the Art of Seeing\\" by Freeman Patterson.  For outdoor photographers, I would suggest you look at Galen Rowell's \\"The Inner Game of Outdoor Photography.\\"ms like \\"The Tao photographer sees opportunities but does not force results\\" and \\"The Tao photographer understands that being awake means knowing when to sleep\\".<br />The Tao is not about technique, it is about philosophy.

The Tao of Photography is not aimed at individuals interested in improving their technical photography skills.  Rather it is aimed at the photographer who will be willing to consider reorienting the way that he or she views the world to improve his or her photography and to find opportunities for personal growth through photography.<br />The book does this by outlining some of the principles of Taoism, an ancient Asian philosophy of life, and then drawing parallels to the teachings of great photographers, like Minor White, Henri Cartier Bresson, and Ansel Adams.  Taoist philosophy states that, to be a sage (and, by extension, a creative photographer), a person must harmonize Great Understanding and Little Understanding, that is, the open mind and the discriminatory or constricted mind.  What the photographer must do is live in the moment and open his mind to the possibilities in the world. One should escape from the state of constricted awareness.  Technique is seen as a possible barrier to better photography.<br />It has been said that the most important tool of a photographer is the mind.  One's philosophical approach to the world may indeed affect the quality of the images that one captures.  If, as I believe, this is so, a book that suggests an adjustment of that approach is worth consideration by the serious photographer.<br />This book convinced me that adopting a Taoist view of the world might improve the quality of the pictures I take.  However, my complaint with the book is that having created a desire to explore Taoist doctrine, there were no guide posts as to how to incorporate those principles into my photography or my life.  The book did suggest several exercises, most of them derived from Freeman Patterson's \\"Photography and the Art of Seeing\\", but I've tried them and they didn't lead to the major refocusing that the book suggests.  In fact the book even quoted Alan Watts, a commentator on Asian philosophy, who says \\"there is no way ...to come into accord with the Tao...because...every method implies a goal. And we cannot make the Tao a goal.\\"<br />So this book got my attention and created a need, and offered no help in satisfying it.  Yet it did cause me to examine my own photographic philosophy.  Any book that can get a serious photographer to reconsider his fundamental approach to life and its effect on his work is certainly worth reading.<br />The book itself is quite beautiful.  The photographs, by a number of great camera artists as well as author Gross, are all in black and white, as if abstracting color would simplify the world and make it easier to come to grips with.  The design is excellent and generous, with plenty of white space, perhaps designed to reflect the serenity of the Way.ord with the Tao...because...every method implies a goal.

This book will not do that.  At most, it might give you a few tips that could make your pictures more attractive.  However I really can't recommend this book to anyone.<br />Some photography instruction books set out a few key principles and then develop techniques from them.  This lets you form a picture in your mind of what you want and then manipulate the environment and your photographic tools to create that picture.  Unfortunately this author doesn't develop the kind of approach to posing that would help you pre-visualize a portrait and then adjust the sitter's pose to fit that concept.  Instead Wacker bombards you with a number of small rules that you may have to keep reviewing regularly unless you have great recall.  He says &quot;don't keep people on flat feet; don't show women's knuckles; turn the body plane away from the camera for a thinner look&quot;.  At the other end of the scale the author frequently reminded me to be imaginative, involved and open to learning.<br />The book is organized into three parts: the psychology of posing; the mechanics of posing and posing in practice.  The psychology section seemed rather elementary but adequate, emphasizing points like building confidence and getting to know the subject.  What should have been the meat was contained in the mechanics section.  For example, there's a chapter on posing tools, in which the author discusses such items as adjustable stools, stepladders, carpet pads and posing tables.  But I didn't learn anything about how to use these tools or when one might be more appropriate than another.<br />I found the section on posing in practice very frustrating.  This part is organized into chapters on children, high school seniors, men, women, etc.  Most of these chapters offered advice that didn't help me.  For example the chapter on women admonished me to pay attention to details they (presumably the author means women) find important, be sensitive, place the body to emphasize gracefulness and femininity, and build excitement.<br />Some photographers might pick up a point or two from Wacker that will improve their portraits, but I'm certain the average photographer would learn more about posing from any good general portraiture book.  I certainly found that I learned a lot more about posing from the book &quot;Professional Secrets of Natural Light Portrait Photography&quot; by Douglas Allen Box, which doesn't even purport to be a posing guide.  Unless you really need a book with just posing tips, look elsewhere to become a better portrait photographer.r example the chapter on women admonished me to pay attention to details they (presumably the author means women) find important, be sensitive, place the body to emphasize gracefulness and femininity, and build excitement.<br />Some photographers might pick up a point or two from Wacker that will improve their portraits, but I'm certain the average photographer would learn more about posing from any good general portraiture book.

From the title this looks like just the book for someone who wants to shoot good portraits without setting up a studio.  However, once you start reading you'll realize that this book is aimed at the professional portrait photographer who has to crank out pictures for a living, rather than for someone interested in capturing the soul of a person on film.  It's not that there isn't a place for such a book but I think the publisher has an obligation to give us fair warning.  Discovering more than half-way through a photography book that the main theme is \\"Art is Determined by the Eye of the Buyer\\" might leave a reader with a bad taste in his or her mouth.<br />The title might lead you to think that this book was a comprehensive approach to the subject, and that it would deal with lighting, posing, the relationship of foreground, subject and background, and the use of props, among other items critical to good portraiture.  Well, the first half of the book does deal with lighting and from the author's presentation, with a little thought, one might be able to derive some comprehensive approach to using light.  He certainly hammers home the theme that outdoor portrait photographers don't want direct lighting.  Smith also advocates shooting early and late in the day and using reflectors for fill light.  But then he lapses into broad generalities.  He tells us make sure the background is right but never makes it really clear how one is to do that.<br />Unfortunately, he spends more of the book telling you that if you want to make money, you've got to work fast and be a step ahead of everyone into the next fad.  Certainly chapters entitled \\"Maximizing Profit\\" and \\"Marketing Outdoor Photographs\\" have little to do with photography itself.<br />I'm certain there are many better books on portrait photography around.  Although by no means comprehensive, the same publisher offers \\"Professional Secrets of Natural Light Portrait Photography\\" by Douglas Allen Box.  The Box book covers many more aspects of the subject, offers a comprehensive approach to outdoor photography and, even though it includes the word \\"professional\\", does not dwell on portrait photography as a money-making enterprise.rs many more aspects of the subject, offers a comprehensive approach to outdoor photography and, even though it includes the word \\"professional\\", does not dwell on portrait photography as a money-making enterprise.	2002-09-04

One way to analyze any piece of art is from the point of view of form and content.  Photography usually seems more concerned with content.  Music, on the other hand, having fewer formal counterparts in the real world, seems to place greater emphasis on form.  Thus, it came as no surprise to me that the work of Tony Sweet should be a lot more about form than other photographs, because Sweet is a former musician.<br />Sweet's pictures are wonderful.  They are rich in color arranged in ways that you rarely encounter in photography.  He loves to play with early-morning and late-day light, and mist seems to call him to his camera.  His subject is outdoor photography but that just seems to be a carrier for color.  Occasionally you will have to look at a picture for a while before you distinguish the content, but while you are looking you will probably be absorbed by the intense tones.  You may even look at a picture and say &quot;I never realized the world looked like that!&quot;<br />Each picture is accompanied by a little blurb that tells you what Sweet was trying to capture and the tools that he used to accomplish it.  Not all of these tools worked for me.  I didn't particularly like the photographs made by making multiple exposures on a single frame and moving the camera slightly between each exposure.  On the other hand the greens and blues reflected from a long exposure of falling water made me realize that I ought to be concentrating more on the color in the world around me.<br />If you buy this book hoping it will make you a more creative photographer, then a lot of work will be required.  This book notes what the photographer was looking for in his pictures but does not tell you how he got there.  You will have to examine the pictures and extract the principles on your own.  If you want to develop your creative instincts you will probably be happier with something like Freeman Patterson's &quot;Photography and the Art of Seeing&quot;<br />In today's world there is a tremendous amount of argument about the manipulation of photographs in computer programs.  Well, these photographs have been manipulated just as much, but in the camera, through the use of long exposures, light-enhancing filters, and selective focus.  If you disapprove of such manipulation, then you may not be interested in these pictures.  If on the other hand, you believe with Picasso that &quot;Art is lies that tell us the truth&quot;, then you will enjoy this unusual exploration of the visual world.s a tremendous amount of argument about the manipulation of photographs in computer programs.

This book concentrates on how to position yourself to take good bird pictures, with lengthy discussions of such things as composition and the building and use of blinds (or, as the English prefer, hides).  This may reflect its author's European orientation where it appears getting close to birds may be much harder than in the U.S.  Many of the top American bird photographers, like Arthur Morris and Moose Peterson seem to prefer the unconcealed approach.  On the other hand, that unconcealed approach leads these same photographers to suggest that 600 mm lenses with 2X teleconverters are essential to good pictures.  The bird photographer without $10,000 to spend on big glass may prefer to consider Gomersall's techniques.  And even the owners of extra-long telephoto lenses may find the techniques suggested by Gomersall useful to get that really difficult bird.<br />After his discussion of field craft, the author discusses several different assignments that he's had and how he approached them.  While interesting, this just supplements the meat that he's provided earlier in the book.  Finally Gomersall discusses post-production problems like cataloging and marketing.<br />Throughout the book there are cameos by other bird photographers like Niall Benvie, but these seem more like interesting garnish than helpful hints.  If you are interested in hints from Benvie you'd be better off reading his \\"The Art of Nature Photography\\", a good work in its own right.<br />I'd be remiss if I didn't compare this book to the bible of bird photographers, Arthur Morris' \\"The Art of Bird Photography\\".  The Morris book devotes more of its pages to the technical aspects of bird photography like film and exposure compensation.  And while Gomersall's pictures are excellent, Morris' pictures are breathtaking.  But both books are tops in what they teach.<br />This book may discourage you from bird photography, or at least help you in a realistic appraisal of success.  The author talks of arriving in his hide before dawn and leaving after dusk, and of spending days without what he considered a successful picture.  These tales of endurance led me to spend several hours in a hide, and I must confess that the pictures I captured were better than my run-of-the-mill shots.  But I'm not certain my devotion runs to fourteen hours in a small cramped tent.<br />But as a bird photographer, I would not want to be without either of these books.you in a realistic appraisal of success.

For people interested in the fourth edition, please read my review which appears under the title of \\"Getting Better.\\"<br /><br />A look at the subtitle to this book, \\"An Introduction to Understanding Images\\", might lead one to believe that it is about photographs and what makes them good or bad (or if there are such things as \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" photographs).  But instead it is about photographic criticism, primarily written.  And even then it really doesn't tell you very much about how to write criticism yourself, or how to interpret what you read, or how to develop patterns of thought that would enable you to criticize in a useful fashion.  Instead most of the book is concerned with the pigeon holes into which different kinds of photographic criticism can be put.<br /><br />An unstated thesis of this book seems to be that the criticism of photographs is an art form itself.  Certainly anyone who has read something like Walter Benjamin's \\"the Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\" might agree.  But if it is an art, then it has both form and content, and any book claiming to teach one about the art (I almost said craft) had better address those points.  To know that there are theoretical schools like Postmodernism or Feminist Theory is useful to those trying to organize photographic criticism and may be helpful to the photographic critic who is trying to decide what his own approach is, but knowing that these schools exist does not help a critic as much as a knowledge of how to look at a picture and organize a written commentary.<br /><br />Fortunately, the book has a number of examples of written criticism, including several examples of different critics addressing the same picture.  Unfortunately most of the criticism addresses the content of the photograph without considering how the form relates to the content or how, as Mark Schorer has said, technique leads to discovery.  For example, Ansel Adams' photographs rely upon the range of light from the whitest whites to the blackest blacks to make their statements about the grandeur of the American wilderness.  Unfortunately, nothing in this book considers photographic technique for the critic, although there are plenty of opportunities.  For example, there is an ambiguous picture by Robert Doisneau taken in a Paris Caf&eacute; showing a younger women and an older man.  The picture is grainy and the depth of field shows the women more sharply then the man.  Both of these techniques should contribute to the possible interpretation of this photograph, and yet they are not mentioned.<br /><br />I think the photo critic who wants to improve his art would be far better served by learning something about photography, and then reading actual criticism, like John Szarkowski's \\"Looking at Photographs\\".  \\"Criticizing Photographs\\" should only be considered as a supplement to such studies.horer has said, technique leads to discovery.

Usually the instructions that come with the camera tell you some of the mechanics of using the flash, including something called through-the-lens flash, but leave you in the dark (pun intended) about when and how to use them.  If you feel that you want to get something more from a flash than a little light in a dark room, you may be looking for expert help.  Well, Susan McCartney may be of a little help but not much more.  On the other hand, since this seems to be the only fairly recent book on the subject in the catalog, maybe this is as good as it gets.<br />McCartney's book is divided into four parts.  The basic flash section deals with cameras with built in flash with an emphasis on point and shoot cameras.  The second part deals with detachable flash.  The author calls the third part advanced flash (which is a collection of hints).  The fourth part deals with specialized and professional flash, which includes those larger units with their own power sources that the pros haul around.  The author tells you how to use your electronic flash on your camera and off, both as a main light and as fill flash (or as she insists upon calling it, flash fill.)  However, she is so repetitive that you wonder if this couldn't have been a sixteen-page pamphlet.  I personally found more help in reading the forty pages on flash in Bob Krist's \\"Secrets of Lighting on Location\\".  And at least Krist's pictures are exciting while most of McCartney's are pedestrian.<br />The biggest problem that every flash photographer has to overcome is the Inverse Square Law, which explains that light from a point source falls off dramatically the further you get from the source.  That is why flash pictures often have well lit foregrounds with dark backgrounds.  A good flash book should deal with this problem extensively, but \\"Mastering Flash Photography\\" gives only a page to the subject.  McCartney scarcely mentions that the easiest way to deal with this problem is to keep all the important elements in the picture at about the same distance from the flash.  In fact many of her illustrations demonstrate the dreaded \\"hot spot\\" that poorly managed flash creates.<br />I was also disappointed by the fact that the author did not discuss when flash was the appropriate tool to use.  I know from my own experience that there are times when it's better to take a long exposure than to use flash, and other times when just a touch of fill flash can change the whole nature of a picture.

Less heralded is the revolution in electronic flash.  Thanks to through-the- lens metering many cameras now have the ability to automatically turn flash on and off to get the just the right amount of light on a subject.  Today's flash offers opportunities for improved picture taking even on a sunny day.<br />This book is aimed at the owners of Nikon speedlights and cameras with built-in flash who want to get better pictures than just a simple flash shot. It takes the few short pages contained in the Nikon instruction manuals and expands them so that the Nikon owner can really understand how to can increase photographic opportunities by knowing what's really going on in slow synch, rear synch and red-eye reduction modes, amongst other things.  It is probably the most comprehensive and up-to-date material that one can find, and can be updated at the author's website.<br />The book has short sections on every Nikon speedlight since the 1969 SB1 and Nikon cameras from the FM2 to the N80.  Of course this means that, unless you have an unusually varied collection of equipment, two-thirds of the book will go unused. On the other hand, if the information that you glean from the pages you do use help you to be a better photographer, you will probably feel it's worth the cost.<br />This book makes no pretense at being more than a technical guide.  But not only will it tell you how to best use the available modes on your camera and speedlight, it will also tell you how to set up for multiple flash and even how to store your speedlight batteries!<br />One thing that this book will not do is tell you how to use speedlights to convert your vision into reality.  On the other hand, if you already understand the principles of good photography, you should be able to take what you learn here and combine it with those principles to improve your pictures.<br /><br />I searched the web to see if there were similar books specifically for the owners of Canons, Minoltas or other brands, without success.  I didn't find any, although my reading revealed sections of other books, like \\"John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide\\" and \\"Mastering Flash Photography\\" by Susan McCartney that covered the same ground, but without so much depth.  Too bad, Canoneers, the Nikonians may be able to get a lead on you.<BR>  <BR>I searched the web to see if there were similar books specifically for the owners of Canons, Minoltas or other brands, without success.

If you fall into that category I suggest you read John Shaw's Landscape Photography or, if you want something a little more up-to-date and covering almost the same ground, Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide.  Benvie presumes you know about technique and tries to develop your creative side so that you can put your opinions, beliefs and experiences into your landscape pictures.  He believes that while great pictures can be found, many others must be intended.<br />The first things he examines are some of the concepts that are critical to understanding what can be influenced to convey your vision: exposure, space, light and darkness.  For example in his discussion of light he talks about the nature of fog and some of its different forms and how this can be used by the photographer in creating his image.<br />He next examines the environments of landscape: wilderness, land dominated by people, city and garden and what he calls the intimate landscape, that is, the detailed view or close-ups.  In discussing the city he talks about both iconic scenes and the incongruous.  His views of each of these environments in terms of photographic vision reflect his feeling about man's relationship to the landscape.  Benvie say &quot;I have merely recounted my own response to environments and suggested that we should think about what we are looking at, rather than taking it at face value.&quot;<br />Benvie discusses the hardware that he uses for landscape photography in a chapter that seemed to say, &quot;my editor said I have to talk about equipment&quot;.  Although I'm sure, for a committed professional, a one-yard square softbox may be essential, most readers will not be inspired to make such an investment.<br />A chapter I particularly liked was devoted to digital finishing.  Few photography authors acknowledge that the digital darkroom is rapidly replacing its chemical predecessor.  Benvie takes several photographs and shows how he adjusted them in Photoshop.  This in no way constitutes Photoshop instruction (for that, I'd recommend Barry Haynes' Photoshop 6 Artistry to both novice and experienced photographers).  But it is interesting to see how a particular artist approaches his work and uses his photographic intentions to select digital tools.<br />This book operates in the overlap between photography and philosophy.  Ultimately the question the reading photographer must ask is whether he (or she) is at the stage where he needs to develop his photographic vision.  If one is, there is no clear or easy path to that development.  Benvie may or may not work for you.  You might benefit from Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography.  Or you might need to look afield to something like Simon Schama's Landscape and Memory.  I believe that this is the most difficult step for a committed photographer and that it takes a combination of many different tools to develop vision.

This book does not teach you what its title purports.<br />Once a photographer has learned how to manipulate the controls on his camera for proper exposure and focus, he wants to know how to capture the world around him with a camera in a way that will convey it to others in the way that he comprehends it in his mind.  This process requires the photographer first to see in his mind's eye what it is he wants to photograph, be it object, relationship or emotion.  Next the photographer arranges the elements onto film or charge coupled device.  Most people can learn how to make an exposure that people will recognize as part of the world.  The quality of previsualization (to use the great photographer Ansel Adams' word) and composition is what makes the difference between a snapshot and art.<br />The title of this book suggests that it will help you improve the quality of your photography.  However, most of the language in this book is vague generalities that defy the reader to extract a useful lesson.<br />Oh, there are some almost useful sections.  The chapter \\"Look before You See\\" suggests a number of photographic exercises that could be useful.  For example Smith advises that you shot a roll of film on a single subject.  \\"Vary the camera angle, the lens, the distance from the subject, and the focus....\\"  But then what.  It would appear that we will automatically extract something from what is on film that will help us learn.  But he doesn't tell us how varying the camera angle will effect the photograph.  We apparently must figure out the results ourselves.  Without a little more guidance, we could well end up with 36 shots of nothing satisfactory.  I wondered if Smith was saying that a person can't be taught composition but can only learn by trial and error.  If that's so, why buy a book?<br />I'm not suggesting that the exercise approach is not one way to learn to be a better photographer, but it needs more explanation.  If you're interested in a book that takes this approach, I'd suggest Freeman Patterson's \\"Photography and the Art of Seeing\\".<br />But most of the book is even less useful.  In the section on lens selection, Smith tells us the choice of lens is determined by subject, use of the photograph, the effect required and physical space limitations.  But he doesn't tell us which lens is best for which subjects.  Instead he tells us \\"learn and test the limitations and capabilities of each lens.\\"<br />Smith gives us a photographic history of his development as an artist that I might have found interesting if he had used it to instruct rather than say, \\"I began a career as a corporate photographer\\".<br />He finishes his book by with a chapter called \\"Applied Design\\" which is supposed to give us insights into specific kind of shooting.  The seven pages devoted to interiors look like a real estate sales brochure.  He makes five learning points like \\"Decide whether to style the room\\" and \\"Choose your camera format\\".  But he doesn't tell us what choice of format is appropriate for what situation.<br />When I review a book that I can't recommend, I usually recommend another that I think is good.  However since most of my work is in landscape and nature photography, I don't have a general composition book to recommend.

And I do mean look, because that?s the way this book teaches.<br />This is a book about photographic composition, which is something a photographer must know well to make pictures that are more than snapshots.  Technique is referred to, but if you want a how-to book get John Shaw?s ?Nature Photography Field Guide?<br />Although Hill claims the writing credits and Wolfe the photography credits, this is somewhat misleading.  The form the book takes is to show a picture taken by Wolfe, or more often two, and then have both comment on the compositional choices.  Since Wolfe is one of the greatest living nature photographers and since Hill is the former picture editor of Audubon Magazine, their commentary is illuminating.  I found the comparison between two pictures of the same or similar subject matter, including why they found one better than the other, to be particularly insightful.  It also adds to the discussion that each of them brings a slightly different sensibility to the pictures.  There are even a few sets where the two disagree as to the better picture.<br />As I said before, this is not a technique book, but technique is examined as a way to enhance the composition.  For example, in the section called ?Reading the Light?, the authors talk about how to find 18% gray, to get a standard exposure from a light meter.  But than they talk about how to use that information to make pictures lighter or darker to enhance the subject.<br />There are various methods of teaching.  Some teachers provide principals and then give examples.  Others present the example and then derive lessons from the example.  Most of us benefit by a combination of both approaches.  Usually photography books take the former approach.  Hill and Wolfe use the latter and this book does it as well as any nature photography book I?ve seen.<br />P.S.

The emphasis throughout the discussion here and later is strictly in terms of landscape photography.  He moves on to the effects of light, composition and a pot pourri of special problems and solutions.<br />Shaw is clear, direct and succinct.  There is no room for confusion about the points he is making, and he makes all the essential points.  No writer gives better instruction.  His photographs have been selected not so much to dazzle you with their brilliance as to support his teaching points, although his pictures are beautiful.<br />So what makes my recommendation conditional?<br />Well, this book was published in 1994 and there have been several technological changes in photography since then.  However, most of what Shaw says here still holds true for landscape photography.  What's changed even more is that in 2000 Shaw's book \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\" was published.  This later book goes over much of the same material as the landscape book, while taking into account the latest technology.  It even uses some of the exact same anecdotes to illustrate points.<br />The difference between the two books is that one looks at just landscape photography while the other looks at the more encompassing class of nature photography.  The Field Guide contains a long chapter on close up photography which may not interest the landscape photographer, while the landscape book aims each chapter exclusively at landscape with slightly more detail.<br />Most of us aren't exclusively committed to landscape so the Field Guide seems like a better choice if you insist on only one book.  But if you're like me, you'll get both books.  If you're serious about landscapes the slant of the earlier book might just give you that slight edge to make a better landscape photograph.slant of the earlier book might just give you that slight edge to make a better landscape photograph.	2001-10-30

For the beginning and intermediate nature photographer this is a complete course under one cover.  But even the expert can derive something from the refresher course this book provides.<br />Shaw begins with fundamentals, with a discussion of the bedrock of photography, exposure.  He makes clear in simple steps the relationship between shutter speed, aperture and film speed.  Even in this day of high tech cameras that handle all of this information if you let them, anyone who really wants to master photography must understand this relationship so they can lie to the camera.  (If you don't know what I mean, you need to<br />read this book.)  At the very least you'll learn when to select aperture, shutter or program mode.<br />Shaw then goes on to discuss equipment and film, lenses, composition, closeups and working in the field.  He even provides a seasonal guide to shooting locations, mostly in the United States.<br />The book is profusely illustrated with Shaw's photos.  How does someone whose prose is so straightforward and concise take such poetic pictures?<br />At first I was surprised at the amount of space devoted to closeups.  I knew that these were a Shaw specialty but I felt that most of the audience for this book would not be that interested in the subject.  Then I realized that I felt this way because I didn't know how to do this well in nature.  After<br />reading this chapter I was inspired to journey into the yard to take a Shaw-instructed closeup of a day lily.  I was so pleased with what I had learned and applied that the picture now hangs on my wall.<br />I have a few minor quibbles with some of Shaw's advice.  For example he urges the reader to use slide film and gives good reasons.  But, particularly in this day of digital imaging, the greater range of color negative film has its uses.  I think Shaw could have acknowledged this.<br />But my quibbles are minor.  This book belongs in every nature<br />photographer's library, even if it is the only one.r.

It just doesn't have enough on fundamental techniques, although there are good tips sprinkled throughout the book.  For a book that starts with fundamentals, like the whys and wherefores of exposure, and covers the gamut to photographic vision, one need to go to a book like John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide.  But this book makes an excellent supplement to a book like Shaw's.  When Benvie discusses exposure control he assumes that you know how light meters work and how exposures are calculated.  He discusses when he uses spot, center weighted or matrix metering for a picture, and exposure compensation.<br />Benvie's pictures are beautiful.  He concentrates a little more on wildlife then landscape but addresses both areas.  Sometimes he tells you a little more than you can probably use.  He gives a lengthy description of how to construct a floating hide (that's a blind for us Yanks) that I read with interest although I was certain I would never build such a contraption.  Then when I looked at the pictures taken from his hide, I began to reconsider.<br />The most significant thing about this book for me is that it is the first one to address the connection between picture taking and digital picture making.  Increasingly I find that even the best custom developers and printers cannot turn my shot into my vision as well as I can in the digital darkroom.  As more and more photographers who are more than just snap-shooters learn this, given the prevalence of computers, digital cameras and the availability of photographic adjustment software at all skill levels, this link will be more important.<br />Not that Benvie teaches how to transform a picture into our vision digitally.  For that you need a lot more detail.  (I recommend &quot;PhotoShop 6 Artistry: Mastering the Digital Image&quot; by Barry Haynes.)  But he tells you enough to give a toehold for further exploration.  I also found his description of how he handled specific photographs in PhotoShop to be very useful for planning my own work.<br />If you've got the fundamentals down, and want to improve your nature photography, this book should be a great help.exploration.

Under each of these headings he shows several of his pictures with a brief statement.  The pictures and the statement often do not relate to his chosen concept.  They rarely relate to his three-step process.  Often he omits really significant information that should be covered.  For example, in his chapter on perspective he does not point out that using different focal length lenses, with different angles of vision, while keeping the image the same size, will change the amount of background included in a shot.<br />Sometimes he is just plain wrong.  In several places he suggests that if he had used a different focal length lens for a subject, changed his distance but kept the exposure and image size the same, he would have gotten a different depth of field.  It's an optical fact that if the image size and exposure are the same with different focal length lenses, the depth of field around the image will still be the same.<br />I also can't walk away from the publication itself.  The book was printed on a semi-coated stock rather than the usual coated stock of photography books.  The color gamut of such paper is less than coated stock and many vibrant colors appear slightly toned down.  Too bad.  Some of Zuckerman's photos are good.<br />In summery this book is a collection of random tips rather than an organized approach to the subject.  And I was frustrated.	2001-10-01

The advanced photographer is searching for something in a photography book different from the novice's search. The advanced photographer understands exposure, focus perspective and the fundamentals and can tie them together to create a sharp, properly exposed image. What he or she wants to know is how to form a vision of the world that he sees and translate it into what Galen Rowell call's a visionary image.<br />\\"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography\\" is not a how-to book. There is no progressive review of the fundamentals. Instead it is a collection of Rowell's essays that have appeared in Outdoor Photographer magazine over the years, revised for the book and placed in a sort of order that ties subjects and ideas together, rather then in the random fashion that they appeared in the magazine. The book is divided into four parts. The first discusses photographic visualization; the second a few advanced techniques that the photographer can use; the third Rowell's own travels and the way he transformed his visions into photos;and the last, a collection of miscellaneous thoughts related to photography ranging from digital manipulation to what's really wrong in the Galapagos.<br />It may be that we cannot be taught how to make the leap from snapshot to visionary image. But perhaps the teacher can open up those recesses in our own mind where our creativity lurks. I know that after reading these essays and thinking about them, I've found my own approach to photography has changed for the better.<br />Even though the book swept me away, I have to confess to one complaint. At the top of each essay is a reference to relevant photographs contained elsewhere in the book. Several photos are referenced by more than one article. In their original magazine format, the photos conveniently appeared at the start of the essay. Here you will have to keep flipping back and forth. There probably is no economical way to provide these links, but it does break up the continuity a bit.<br />Although I'm pretty closely aligned with Rowell's political philosopy, which creeps in throughout the essays, especially in the final section, there's still enough appropriately provocative material here from which a photographer with a different philosophy can benefit.<br />Although you may feel driven to devour this volume as quickly as possible once you get a hint of its goals, I think you will keep it on hand, to occasionally dip into an essay or two to stir up your own photographic creativity.bit.<br />Although I'm pretty closely aligned with Rowell's political philosopy, which creeps in throughout the essays, especially in the final section, there's still enough appropriately provocative material here from which a photographer with a different philosophy can benefit.<br />Although you may feel driven to devour this volume as quickly as possible once you get a hint of its goals, I think you will keep it on hand, to occasionally dip into an essay or two to stir up your own photographic creativity.	2001-09-25

Norton's Outdoor Photography: Techniques for the Advance Amateur and Professional sounded like just the book for me.  I didn't want another how to.  I know how to manipulate the camera and what happens when light hits film.  That's for the beginning photographer.  What I wanted was something that went beyond technique to the point where technique becomes discovery.  What I wanted, to quote Norton, was &quot;a more methodical, precise approach to capturing the essence of scene or subject.<br />Norton's first chapter got me really excited.  He talked about making the technical choices that bring order out of chaos.  For example, he suggested that this involved &quot;the tough process of isolating and arranging the picture elements.&quot;  That certainly sounded like he was on the right track.<br />But then the book went down hill.  I got the usual discussion of light metering, the differences between lens lengths, the elements of composition - in short the usual set of instructions for just beyond beginning photographers.  Oh, the instructions were accurate and beautifully illustrated.  But they didn't tell me how one could take the elements of composition beyond a list of elements and into &quot;art&quot;.<br />Now maybe I expected to much.  After all, if creating art was easy enough to put into a 152 page book, Art Wolfe wouldn't have a job.  But I blame Norton (or his publishers.)  They put on the catchline &quot;Techniques for the Advanced Amateur and Professional&quot;.  And then they gave me the same stuff as many another photography book writer.  For my money, I would take John Shaw over Norton any day.  At least he makes no bones about what he's teaching.<br />In summary, as a manual for photographers who know how to properly expose film, this is as good a book as any.  But for the advanced amateur and professional who wants help in creating art, look elsewhere.	2001-09-19

Mastering the technology is one thing, but selecting the part of the world to put a frame around is another.<br />When someone in an outdoor photography newsgroup recommended &quot;Seeing Landscapes: the Creative Process Behind Great Photographs&quot; by Charlie Waite, I got very excited.  The title reminded me of one of my old favorites &quot;Photography &amp; the Art of Seeing&quot; by Freeman Patterson.  The title made me hope that this book would zero in on our way of looking at landscapes, on deciding what we should put the frame around.<br />I was disappointed.  &quot;Seeing Landscapes&quot; is a great collection of Waite's work.  If you are the kind of person who can learn by just studying another's work, this book will do the trick.  Otherwise the brief narrative that accompanies each picture will not help you develop a cohesive way of seeing landscapes.  Oh, you will find a few &quot;rules&quot;: be patient; look for strong lines; capitalize on color differences; don't let the near shore cut off a reflection in a body of water.  But don't expect to come to the landscape with a new vision.  Hopefully, that's in someone else's book.	2001-07-09

It certainly debunked many of the myths that have grown up around this composer, particularly those relating to his relationship with his wife.  None of the other works of comparable length did as well.  On the other hand his discussion of the composer's music was more of the awe-struck fan variety and would provide no new insights into what, for most people, is the most important aspect of his life.  As to Carr's writing, it is light and easy reading.  At the same time, it does seem occasionally to reach too far to speculate on some aspect of Mahler's life that, as a good researcher, he admits, can not be documented.  Every Mahler fan will have to read this book, but none will feel that it can begin to compare with Mitchell or de la Grange.  Others, looking for a light gossipy life of Mahler will enjoy a few hours with Carr.	1998-03-03
