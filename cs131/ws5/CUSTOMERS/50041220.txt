This book was released in England on the 1st of September and since I couldn't wait until it was released here in the U.S., I ordered.  <br /> <br />I was not dissappointed and neither will you be. <br /> <br />David Gemmell fans know that this British author is most famous for writing in the fantasy genre. He is a master of creating a world and then peopling it with characters that are more human than any writer I have encountered. Though \\"Lord of the Silver Bow\\" is the first part in a trilogy about the Trojan War, Gemmell still writes like it were his own world. In fact, if the reader didn't know better, he would think that David Gemmell had been in ancient Greece scribing the events as they happened.  <br /> <br />Historically, Lord of the Silver Bow is probably not accurate as it is peopled with real historical figures as well as figures from Gemmell's fertile imagination. Whatever historical \\"truths\\" that Gemmell misses are more than made up for by his deep insight into the minds of his characters. As in all of his novels the characters contain within them the whole range of human strengths and weaknesses; David Gemmell seems to suggest that a strength and weakness can be one and the same thing.  <br /> <br />The story follows Helikaeon a sailor, warrior (and possible King) as he deals with love, death, loss and gain. Odyseuss is a homely, story telling, king that adds wisdom and humor to a world that for the most part is pretty grim.  <br /> <br />\\"Lord of the Silver Bow\\" is a wonderful beginning to what could quite possibly be the greatest work of an already brilliant writer.  <br /> <br />I for one can hardly wait for the rest of the trilogy to unfold.	2005-09-20

US	50041220	R3KEWGZMR0JDCF	0741423200	323184872	American Warrior	Books	5	62	63	N	N	Darkly satisfying	\\"American Warrior\\" is not a \\"feel good\\" sort of book nor does it neatly fit into any particular genre. However, it is a wonderfully written book. James Snyder writes the book in the present tense and completely through the eyes of his main character Paul Brett. Brett is \\"poor, white, trash\\" growing up in the late 50', early 60's of California. From his early childhood Brett is taught about suffering and pain at the hands of his father. He is rescued from a beating by some rough Philipino kids by a reclusive Indonesian/ Dutchman haunted by his own past. the old man teaches the boy Penjak Silat (an Indonesian martial art) that helps Paul Brett transcend his difficult life situation.  <br /> <br />The book follows Paul through his childhood and into his early adult years, where he becomes a Green Beret and later a SOG team member. The book handles growing up in poverty and the frustrations of young soldiers whose government has tied their hands, in an adroitly compassionate manner.  <br /> <br />This book is not for the squeamish or for readers looking for a pure action yarn. There is plenty of action and violence, but the book does not glorify it. Rather, \\"American Warrior\\" is about what it means to be human and about what it means to overcome circumstances dictated by an uncaring world.  <br /> <br />This is a wonderful piece of literature.	2005-08-22

This book is short and to the point. \\"Martial arts made me do it\\".<br /><br />The life story of Tonie Gatlin is a sad one filled with abuse and self-loathing. However, Tonie Gatlin's continuous blaming of martial arts for her pain has little or no value to her path of healing, and in fact is a stumbling block to continued growth. This is a book filled mumbo-jumbo about \\"Satan\\" being responsible. Until one can take complete responsibility for ones action, one is destined to repeat them.<br /><br />The fundimentalist philosophy espoused by this book is exactly the reason that so many people have become disenchanted with the Christian Church. The idea that all other beliefs are evil and satanic just does not resonate with a majority of people. It is this very belief that \\"my religion\\" is the only true one that has brought the world to a place where men will fly planes into buildings in order to kill complete strangers or shoot a doctor at an abortion clinic...these people after all are not of the \\"true\\" faith and therefore they are less than human. Fundimentalist beliefs are all the same...they all claim to \\"Know\\" the true way.<br /><br />Gatlin's real issues come from a sad abusive home life as a child. Her inability to deal with her justifiable rage is the real \\"demon\\" in her story, not martial arts, or lesbianism, or feminism. It is simply that she was a sad child with little or not support and was not taught early on to make healthy choices.<br /><br />Linda Nathan has done a pretty good job of researching martial arts and it's history, however, it is her conclusions that are questionable. Her understanding of \\"eastern religions\\" (guess what folks, Christianity is an Eastern religion, although badly interpreted by western minds) is superficial at best. She goes into great detail explaining how the dragon and the serpent are important to eastern religions (they represent wisdom) and that they are really cleverly hidden symbols for Satan.<br /><br />Linda Nathan rights with the typical arrogance of Christian Fundimentalist: Their way is the only way.<br /><br />I'm glad that Tonie Gatlin has found peace in her life, but saddened that she felt a need to endorse a book filled with so much religious intolerance.Linda Nathan rights with the typical arrogance of Christian Fundimentalist: Their way is the only way.  <br /> <br />I'm glad that Tonie Gatlin has found peace in her life, but saddened that she felt a need to endorse a book filled with so much religious intolerance.	2005-08-17

The plot is put together nicely and characters, for the most part, are believable and interesting.  <br /> <br />My only criticism (and it is not of the author) is that this book is seriously in need of an editor, or if it had one, the editor needs to be gently slapped. There are quite a few errors in the book; it is an awful lot like a first draft of a novel but good none the less. If not for the typo's and sentence errors, I would have given this novel 5 stars. <br /> <br />Now that the criticism is out of the way; E.C. Dearing is a good solid writer with an extremely open minded view of the martial arts. Martial artists tend to fall into two camps: Traditionalists and Non-traditionalists. Dearing seems able to see the value in all of the approaches and seems to appreciate that each has its strengths and weaknesses.  <br /> <br />If you are a martial artist or if you are at all interested in martial arts, you will definitely enjoy Te Waza. I highly recommend it.	2005-08-04

Dr. Clayton manages to adroitly slip the veil of martial arts pseudo-history/legend (a herculean task for those raised on the legends) and writes an extremely well researched exposition of why Karate (particularly Shuri-te) is the way it is.  <br /> <br />Karate has been long espoused as a \\"Civil\\" art rather than a martial art. In other words, an art that was developed by peasants for defense against Samurai. Dr. Clayton, proves that in fact Shuri-te was developed by amazing warriors, willing to face guns, knives and swords with nothing but their bare hands. Shuri-te was not designe for \\"self\\"-defense or for fighting one opponent, but as a brutally devastating form of hand to hand combat, designed to defeat multiple, armed warriors from obducting, harming or killing their King. In truth, Clayton makes the claim that it was a bodyguard art.  <br /> <br />His description of what he calls \\"The Shuri Crucible\\" is fascinating and extremely well documented. Not only does it explain the development of the style, but also explains why a Karate Dojo is as it is.   <br /> <br />This book is a wonderful piece of well reasoned, researched history for anyone interested in the origins of Karate or anyone interested in understanding how any martial develops.	2005-08-01

However, John Twelve Hawks (most likely a pen name) does really give people something to think about. The author's world is our world, and the message he gives about mankind being barely aware of the deeper realities that are going on around them is a good and true one.  <br /> <br />In my view, this is a novel about consciousness. Although the premise of the Brethren (A \\"Big-Brotherish\\" organization that dominates the consciousness of the world) is a bit simple and smacks of conspiracy theory; the metaphor of what we (particularly western civilization) sees is a good one. If one reads this book with an eye for the metaphor and archetypes a lot of truth about how we see the world (or don't see the world) can be found and in that, the greatest value of this book lies.  <br /> <br />I recommend reading the Travelor and will definitely read the follow up novels. This is a great first effort and with time and confidence, the authors writing style will improve quickly...he/she has a healthy writing style that just needs time and confidence.	2005-07-25
US	50041220	R2R641IN2GITWE	0345466780	791773328	The Sunset Warrior	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Original Fantasy	Eric Van Lustbader writes a great fantasy novel!  <br /> <br />The premise of \\"the Sunset Warrior\\" (and the trilogy in general) is based on the idea that some great ecological disaster has taken place. People have been driven underground, but so long ago that those that are left have lost the history and reason why they have left the face of the planet. The technology that has supported the peoples of the \\"freehold\\" is beginning to shut down and the people have split into a feudal, caste system similar to 16th century Japan. There are none left that completely understand how their technology works (not far from where we are today).  <br /> <br />Enter Ronin, a highly skilled warrior and free thinker and he begins to ask questions.  <br /> <br />This novel is so very human: it questions the mores and attitudes that most of us just accept as reality. It is about the sacrifice that each of us must make in order to \\"fit in\\" and in contrast, the sacrifices that we make to be genuinely ourselves. \\"Sunset Warrior\\" is a wonderful metaphor for questioning the \\"machine\\" that we all live in today. <br /> <br />An orginal fantasy that is definitely worth reading.	2005-07-22

If you enjoy Robert B. Parkers Spenser series, you can't help but enjoy Black's work.  <br /> <br />Ron Shade is definitely a work in progress. Although an adult, this character often seems to make some juvenile decisions and the reader may occasionally have a tough time suspending his/her disbelief. Having said that, Black is definitely developing as a writer. His dialogue is excellent and his stories believable and light. <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable detective novel made all the more real due to Black's real life descriptions of Chicago and the greater Chicago area.	2005-06-20

Initially, her narrative style put me off a bit. I'm used to a lot on dialogue that describes the situations rather than a lot of narration telling me what is happening. HOWEVER, within a couple of chapters, I was completely pulled into the story by Isabel Allende's tremendous ability to invite her reader into the world that she so adroitly creates. I found myself smiling as each piece of the puzzle that makes up the story I know so well fell into place. Allende allows her readers to observe young Diego De La Vega as each of his skills, personality traits and burning desires snap neatly into place. None of the characters motivations are left to chance, which makes for wonderful story telling. <br /> <br />Her detailed descriptions of early California, Barcelona and Panama make the reader believe that Alende actually has seen and experienced the 18th century world that she describes.  Also, she pulls no punches when it comes to her description of the indians and their mistreatment by early European aristocrats. The deep rifts between the upper class and lower class that is currently still in place in Mexico is made clear.  <br /> <br />Although the world of 18th century California is detailed, this story is character driven. Diego De La Vega (Zorro) is an extremely three dimensional character that runs the gamit of human emotion and Allende allows her readers to see his flaws as well as his attributes (as is so often true, the two are one and the same). Bernardo, who in previous incarnations of the Zorro story is a typical \\"sidekick\\", is anything but a \\"sidekick\\" in this novel. Bernardo is a complex, spiritual young man that in many ways is the moral superior of Diego. He is a brother, but also a wise guide, keeping the brash young man on his life's path. Rather than serving Diego because he is of \\"higher\\" caste, Bernardo serves out of love and a deep sense of destiny. In Yogic terms, these two men have found their darma, their purpose in life. <br /> <br />\\"Zorro\\" is an interesting look at the legend as well as a wonderful, non-judgmental description of a world of the near past. \\"Zorro\\" is fiction, but Allende fills this story with historical fact as well clever analysis of the ramifications of many of the political decisions made at the time. Every dollar you spend on this one is an investment in thought and entertainment.	2005-05-23

Having said that, both do have one thing in common: they are either really \\"on\\" or really \\"off\\". In the case of The Bourne Legacy, Eric Lustbader I am sorrowful to say, is \\"off\\". It may have been that he was attempting to copy Ludlum's \\"workman\\" style of writing and in so doing lost his own voice. Whatever the case, THe Bourne Legacy did not do it for me.      In the original Bourne trilogy, Jason Bourne is a powerful and in control figure even in the face of insurmountable odds. Though the character is confused about his past and how it connects to his present and future, he still decides strongly and takes action. In Legacy, Lustbader draws him as a bumbling, two dimensional character barely able to hold his own and disconnected from his feelings, while occasionally catapulting his abilities to superhuman levels. This left me unable to suspend my disbelief and find a \\"place\\" for Jason Bourne in my psyche. Bourne seems plastic to me in this book as do the other characters and I never really empathyze enough with them to care about them.     I suspect that Lustbader works best in his own worlds and should possibly stay away from \\"playing\\" in another writers sandbox.      Whatever the case, I am sad to say that I had a really hard time finishing this novel. It left me empty and dissappointed. I will of course give Eric Van Lustbader another read as some of his books have been brilliant, but I will avoid any more of his Bourne novels and re-read the old Ludlum classics.	2005-05-10

If one reads any of Stover's other novels (Star Wars or other) you know that Stover himself must have spent large quantities of time deep within the \\"dark side\\". This story will add tremendous depth to the original trilogy and most definitely encourage even those that have seen the first three movies many times to watch them with new eyes.  <br /> <br />Anakin Skywalker's \\"fall\\" is very real and mirrors what all of us experience within our lives at one point or the other. Evil is often times in the eye of the beholder. Stover reinforces the idea that attachment always leads to suffering. This is a belief espoused by most religions and philospies, but is  particularly important in the Vedic and Buddhist traditions of India and China. <br /> <br />Star Wars is an archetypal story that has become the myth of the 20th and 21st century. Read the book and enjoy it...it will add a whole new depth to the new film as well as adding a new twist to the previous five.	2005-05-05

The story itself is once again a relatively simple mystery. What makes \\"Deshi\\" so satisfying though is John Donohue's maturing of the characters. Connor Burke seems to be moving more and more from his College Prof. role into a martial arts master. In \\"Sensei\\", Yamashita Sensei is definitely the master and Burke the student. However, in \\"Deshi\\" Donohue does an admirable job of maturing the relationship. Partly due the events depicted in \\"Sensei\\" Burke and Yamashita are beginning to see each other as peers and Burke's projections of Yamashita's invincibility are beginning to desolve and the view of his own skills are beginning to strengthen.  <br /> <br />\\"Deshi\\" definitely has a spiritual component and does a great job of comparing and contrasting true martial spirituality with the kind peddled by con artists and fakirs.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend \\"Deshi\\" to martial artists, spiritual seekers, or just fans of action/adventure in the Robert B.

Although the couples views on Ahimsa (non-harming) are controversial (and to many readers somewhat extreme), they most certainly make one think.    I have had the pleasure of practicing Jivamukti Yoga (not with Sharon and David, but with their students) and find it to be an energetic and well integrated style of Yoga. Like all yoga, Jivamukti's asanas and philosphy will not be for everyone. Yoga is a personal path and each of us that embark upon that path must invariably find their own way.     What I enjoyed most about the book was that it is a detailed description of two people that clearly have found their path. Many find their path extreme, but that is for the reader and individual Yogi to decide. Ultimately you will recieve from the book what you need and put aside that which does not serve you.     I definitely recommend that yogis read this book in order to clarify their own path.	2005-01-03

I always wonder how it is that guys like Mike Evans can lambast others for interpreting the bible as something other than literal, while at the same time interpreting biblical prophecy to suit their own brand of facism. Literal interpretations of the bible are still interpretations. The whole message of Jesus was about forgiveness, gentleness and non-violence; not once did he encourage any to destroy those that didn't agree with them. How sad that the beautiful teachings of Christ can be turned into more reasons to hate and kill each other. God is not an angry and jealous God. Christ came to tell us that he is a loving father. I suspect Christ would weep after reading something like this that justifies the anger, hatred and death that we pile on our brothers. <br />	2004-08-25

The aspect of Lowry's writing that is so important is that he demystifies the martial arts while at the same time allowing them to keep their special flavor.<br />Autumn Lightening gives the reader a glimpse into Dave Lowry's personal journey as a martial artist and into the interesting history and mythology surrounding his Kenjutsu Ryu.<br />A wonderful, quick read that should be required for all American martial artists.	2004-07-19

However, it is well written, the characters are very three dimensional and real. <br />The story begins with a &quot;monk&quot; who has mummified himself in seiza in the mountains of Japan. He's left a manuscript written by hand and that manuscript makes up the bulk of the story. This is an extremely spiritual story about the lives of three men and two women. How the threads of their lives intertwine to create an amazing tapestry of interwoven destinies. This book is about martial arts, buddhism, enlightenment, greed and avirice. The author contends that all actions have a higher purpose, even if the individuals involved cannot see it and the darkest actions often lead to the greatest realizations.<br />I was pleasently surprised by &quot;WAZA&quot; and recommend this book to any serious martial artist and/or spiritual seeker.	2004-07-19
US	50041220	R11T80BRAEL5ZX	0812548078	638220146	Blood Brothers	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Great mixture of action and mysticism	This was a great read! As so many of Barnes' novels, Blood Brothers tackles a series of human issues. The story essentially centers around two men who could not be more different: A black former computer hacker; divorced and still dealing the the pain of his split family. And a white, former special forces/martial artist serving a life sentence for the murder of his family...oh, and he is involved with the Aryan Nation in prison. <br />What makes this story so interesting is not how different these men are, but how truly similar they are. The two are forced to work together to unravel a mystery that is over a hundred years old. As always Barnes does a masterful job of getting his reader to 'become' each of the characters. In my opinion, great writing is about people, not about deep storylines, and Barnes pulls the reader in from the first page, making them truly empathize and care about all the characters. <br />A great read with lots of twists and turns.	2004-05-13

All of Gemmell's books are formulaic; however, that does not take away from the power of his message. Gemmell is the master of the archetypal, heroes journey story, and his characterizations and deep insight into the human condition always make his books memorable and lead the reader to examine the nature of evil, heroism, and the dark and light sides within their own being.<br />Skilgannon has been resurrected after 1,000 years. We learn that he has been fighting demons in the void (similar to the Catholic Purgatory). He has returned to fulfill a prophecy that he will destroy the Eternal...an old foe/lover from a thousand years ago.<br />As always, Gemmell's characters are never one thing; never one dimensional. The truly evil are capable of the highest good, and those that appear without flaw are shown to be anything but.<br />For Gemmell fans, there are no big surprises in &quot;Swords of Night and Day&quot;, but both new readers and lifelong fans will come away entertained and as always somewhat enlightened concerning the nature of man and his place in the Universe.<br />This book is worth every dime.	2004-04-13

As much as I enjoyed his orginal Drizzt stories, the later ones have been done to death. There is nothing left to write that hasn't been written about the dark elf and I would recommend that Salvatore move on. Having said this, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the Highwayman. There is nothing new in this story, there are no deep revelations or Universe expanding messages. This book is just good, clean, swashbuckling fun. It follows the life of Bransen (the Highwayman) and his parents as they struggle with racial bigotry, bigotry towards the handicapped, and religious xenophobia. You will find no surprises in this novel, but you will cheer for a small handicapped boy as he learns to release the hero within, and see himself the way God sees him.<br />I had a great time and can't wait until Salvatore dishes up another helping of the Highwayman!	2004-03-23

My interest in Martial arts and all things Eastern had drawn me to it. I really enjoyed it and hoped that La Plante would write a sequel (it was really set up for one). Finally I found it. It had only been published in Europe so it was not easy to find. It has a totally different feel from the first novel and frankly really stretches one's ability to suspend disbelief. However, having said that, that book really grew on my...it took two readings, but I really enjoyed the action sequences and the interesting twists that La Plante used in the novel. <br />If you enjoyed the first, take the time to read the second. You won't be dissappointed.	2004-03-17

But if you just want to relax and be thoroughly entertained read 'Deathstalker Legacy'. This is Space Opera at its' finest and just plain fun. It's filled with larger than life characters and as in all of the 'Deathstalker' books a threat that is completely impossible to overcome. <BR>As long as you don't expect some deep meaning or a treatise on religion and politics, you will enjoy 'Deathstalker Legacy'. <BR>Can't wait for the next installment Mr. Green!	2003-11-25

Those that have studied the Ramayana will enjoy their favorite characters as they come to life and take on dimensions that the poem could never touch. However, no particular knowledge of Indian history and culture is needed to enjoy this book. Mr. Banker has written this story to be enjoyed with little or no background knowledge of its' history.<br />The Prince of Ayodhya is fantasy and high adventure set in a world that most westerners have never experienced. If you love fantasy, adventure and historical fiction, you'll love this book. <br />A new and original voice has stepped into the world of fantasy and adventure! Bravo Mr. Banker, I can hardly wait for the next installment!	2003-09-05

If you don't want anything to heavy and are into the Robert B. Parker style of gumshoe, you will definitely enjoy Michael Blacks' introdcution to Ron Shade, detective and martial artist. <br />The story, like all good detective novels, is written in the first person. Ron Shade is a former SWAT team member and martial artist, currently attempting to win the world heavyweight kickboxing title. The story is simple and fairly straight forward (Really just a missing person case) and therefore highly believable. Black's understanding of police procedure and his in depth knowledge of the feelings that a fighter has while he trains are very entertaining. There is a nice romance underlying the main story that keeps the reader caring about the characters. Also, the descriptions of Chicago and the surrounding suburbs are right on the nut.<br />This book was definitely worth the money spent. Hopefully we haven't seen the last of Michael Black.	2003-08-18

Shatterpoint may be the first Star Wars book that actually is written for someone older then fourteen. <br />This is another great Matthew Stover novel. Finally a Star Wars book that is gritty and dark; that faces the multiple aspects that make up the human psyche. Shatterpoint not only investigates the dark side of the force, but it investigates the dark side of human nature. <br />As in all of Stover's novels, there is no hard line between good and evil, an important lesson especially in times of war (like now) when it's easy to slip into an 'us and them' mentality.<br />Stover has obviously taken a page (or several) from Heart of Darkness. Mace Windu travels deep into a forest like none on this earth. As he travels deeper and deeper in an attempt to 'save' his one time Padawan, Windu is forced to investigate all of his values. Values that had seemed so hard and fast, but turn out to be useless in a world outside the Jedi Temple. Shades of gray abound and often it is difficult if not impossible to decide who is right and who is wrong.<br />If you are interested in a Star Wars book that goes beyond black and white, droids and wookies; a novel that is about the moral puzzles that each of us are forced to confront and solve every day, read Shatterpoint. You won't be dissappointed.	2003-06-26

Although marketed as a Druss novel, Druss is a secondary character in this morality play. Skilgannon is the real star of this novel; a deadly young warrior with a twisted past. As in all of the David Gemmell novels, Skilgannon is a damaged and in many ways morally corrupt individual reminiscent of the early Clint Eastwood, 'Man with No Name' characters.<br />As is all of Gemmell's work, the writing is sharp and the dialogue clean and clear. Gemmell's real gift however, lies in his utterly human, 3-dimensional characters. Interestingly, the author explains (via his characters dialogue) how a warrior must think in black and white terms; wrong and a right; good and evil. Gemmell's characters are none of those things. They are all wonderfully filled with shades of gray, just like all of us.<br />'White Wolf' and all of it's new characters are a wonderful addition to the continuing Drenai saga. I for one would like to see more of Skilgannon. Although complete in and of itself, this novel begs to be followed with more stories of Skilgannon.	2003-04-14

Steven Barnes has created a world in which the roles of African's and European's circa 1800 America have switched places. This book like Lion's Blood, really gets to the heart of slavery and racism. In both of these books, it's power that is the real culprit. Like our own history, it is economic expedience that helps the power elite justify their views on other races; justification for seeing a fellow human as somehow sub-human.  <br />The book is the continuing story of Aiden and Kai, a former slave and his former master that continue their relationship well into adulthood. The book not only further develops the two friends relationship with each other, it also delves into the difficulties of being powerless and powerful. Both have their pitfalls in Zulu Heart, just like they do in real life.<br />Even the language used in the book is interesting. Negative thoughts are described as: 'Pale' as apposed to 'Dark'. Barnes seems to suggest that the very language that we use today is subtely racist. I am not schooled enough in the history of the language to know if that's true or not, but it does make for an interesting read and it makes the reader really think.<br />Barnes is a master story teller that continues to develop and flesh out his characters from the previous book. He's done a wonderful job of maturing both Kai and Aiden as well as adding some new exciting characters. As always, Barnes descriptions of Martial Arts and training are second to none. He has blended an interesting amalgam of Indonesian martial arts, African knife fighting and Fillipino Kali with a smattering of Sufi philosophy. Wow. <br />This is certainly a series that he could continue for some time and still remain fresh and exciting to readers. ...	2003-04-03

This was Bruce Holmes first novel (I assume it's the only one he's written). 'Anvil of the Heart' is one of those rare novels that is entertaining and really ABOUT something. It was written some time ago, but delves into the idea of creating super children and people that are 'perfect' . Holmes suggests (and I believe him) that our flaws are what makes us human, and only by embracing those flaws do we realize our magnificence.<br />This book is about what it means to be human. Read and enjoy this one, it's well worth your time.	2003-04-03

It's very clear that Donohue has a great deal of first hand knowledge about the martial arts that he features in 'Sensei'. Readers who are interested will gain a great deal of insight into the mind of traditional japanese martial artists and martial arts masters. I also really enjoyed the inside look that Donohue gives concerning the psychology and methods of modern police work.<br />I will be on the lookout for more of this man's work.<br />Congratulation Mr. Donohue.	2003-03-25

Andrew Harvey is an extremely passionate and learned man. His insights into the subject of Jesus, both Historical and biblical are fascinating. I would definately recommend this book if you are interested in a different viewpoint on Jesus. <br />Having said that that though, I did find, (as some of the other reviewers did as well) that Andrew Harvey's view of the story was simply another form of fundamentalism; albeit fundamentalism from a mystical stand point. Harvey continually points out that the feminine aspect of the Christ consciousness are completely dismissed by the traditional view of the Church. I agree. However, Harvey completely dismisses the Masculine aspect of the Divine and in fact Harvey goes as far as suggesting that all evil and darkness are in fact masculine. He makes the claim that without bonding to the feminine, that the masculine is just chaos and darkness. Again, I agree with him on this point, however if that in fact is true then the converse of that must also be true. The feminine would be incomplete and chaotic without it's polar opposite. Andrew Harvey may agree with me on that topic but there is no evidence within his writings to suggest that he does. He tirades against patriarchal society and the suppression of women as a divine force. I think he's right. Conventional religion has long denied that the feminine energy of the Divine was equally important as the masculine. Harvey seems to suggest that a matriarchy would be flawless and without the same problems as a patriarchy.<br />The book is really worth reading for it's refreshing and interesting view of the traditional story of Christ. But Harvey is as intolerant of the masculine as the traditionalists are of the feminine.<br />This is just another vew of the story. It should be read with an open mind and with the understanding that it is as bias as the traditional version.	2003-01-07

However in \\"Lion's Blood\\", Barnes has created his masterpiece. The story centers around two young men, Aidin and Kai, each about the same age and each from different cultures. In this Alternate history Whites are slaves, and Blacks are the masters. One of the themes that you will see when reading Barnes solo novels (and also in some of his joint efforts) is the development of trust between people of different races. They learn to find the commonalities between them instead of focusing on the differences. <BR>     Barnes manages to decry slavery and point out the inherent evil of it without condemning those on either side as completely evil, or completely good. <BR>     Bravo Mr. Barnes.<BR>     It's been a long time since Steven has published a solo novel. This extremely well written and well researched novel is well worth the wait.	2002-02-18

I wasn't dissappointed.      &quot;Blade of Tyshalle&quot; is an exciting book filled with Stover's trademark violence and anti-establishment sentiments. However this one is very different from the first; it is far darker (if that's possible)and delves more into the minds of the other characters. The first book was for the most part told from Hari/Caine's point of view; &quot;Blade&quot; gives the reader the chance to see through the eyes of Stover's other characters, as well as Hari Michaelson's tortured vision of the world.      Warning: if you're not ready to visualize some pretty horrible imagery don't read this one; however, if you can get past that (it is not gratuitous, but necessary to the story in my opinion)you will learn a lot about yourself, especially if you have a somewhat Libertarian view of the world. You'll also have great time while doing it.   I will be reading everything this guy has written, and anxiously await all his future work.	2001-07-19
