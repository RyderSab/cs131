US	52793955	R2LB8KX56UBPYZ	1584180218	558798483	Disciple & Master	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Gives Insights into Witkin's Thought Processes (Note: Not for the Squeamish)	This book, whose \\"original French edition\\" was \\"Joel-Peter Witkin, disciple et matre\\" published in Paris by Marval in 2000, is valuable for two reasons.  First, it \\"unites Witkin's photographs\\" with previous photos that inspired Witkin; in contrast, to understand some of Witkin's famous photographs based on paintings*, you often need to scurry around to find reproductions of the paintings.  Second, similar to Ansel Adams's book \\"Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs\\" (1989), this book gives insights into the artist's thought processes that led to the creation of his photos. <br /> <br />This book starts with an essay, \\"Joel-Peter Witkin, Disciple and Master\\" by Pierre Borhan.  It rambles a bit, but is overall informative. <br /> <br />The central part of the book is \\"Becoming a Camera\\" with \\"texts by\\" and \\"selection of images\\" by Witkin, and \\"with the collaboration of Eugenia Parry.\\"  Here are the names of the photographers who inspired Witkin, and the titles of Witkin's resulting works:  Mayer & Pierson -> \\"The Prince Imperial, New Mexico, 1981\\"; Weegee -> \\"Fetishist, San Francisco, 1981\\"; Jacques Henri Lartigue -> \\"Collector of Fluids, New Mexico, 1982\\"; Wilhelm von Gloeden -> \\"Von Gloeden in Asien, New York, 1984\\"; unidentified -> \\"Amour, New Mexico, 1987\\"; Lewis Carroll -> \\"Apollonia and Dominatrix Creating Pain in the Art of the West, New York City, 1988\\"; Carl Lumholz -> \\"Nude with Mask, Los Angeles, 1988\\"; Brassai -> \\"Woman with Appendage, New Mexico, 1988\\"; Charles Negre -> \\"Negre's Fetishist, Paris, 1990\\"; Man Ray -> \\"Woman Once a Bird, Los Angeles, 1990\\"; Walker Evans -> \\"Feast of Fools, Mexico City, 1990\\"; Diane Arbus -> \\"Man with Dog, Mexico, 1990\\"; Jean-Baptiste Sabatier-Blot -> \\"Satiro, Mexico, 1992\\"; Felix Nadar and Adrien Tournachon -> \\"Dog on a Pillow, Marseille 1994\\"; Charles Winter -> \\"Studio de Winter, Paris, 1996\\"; Roger Fenton -> \\"Who Naked Is, Paris, 1996\\"; Henri Cartier-Bresson -> \\"The Shepherd's Sunday, Rome, 1996\\"; Disfarmer -> \\"Black Man, Rome, 1996\\"; Kimura Kenichi -> \\"The Eggs of My Amnesia, Rome, 1996\\"; unidentified -> \\"Abundance, Prague, 1997\\"; Roger Fenton -> \\"Still Life with Mirror, 1998\\"; Etienne-Jules Marey -> \\"Beauty has Three Nipples, Berlin, 1998\\"; unidentified -> \\"Anna Akhmatova, Paris, 1998\\"; F. Holland Day -> \\"Crucified Horse, New Mexico, 1998\\"; Henri Manuel -> \\"Shoe-F__ker, Paris, 1998\\"; and Horst P. Horst -> \\"Humor and Fear, New Mexico, 1998.\\" <br /> <br />A one-page epilogue by Witkin (stating, among other things, \\"I know that I will be remembered as a Christian artist\\" and \\"I believe that my work will make a contribution to history\\") and credits conclude the book.  Buy this and other books by and about Witkin** at Amazon.com! <br /> <br />Note: This book is not for the squeamish.  As is common in Witkin's work, the book shows plenty of nudity, body parts, S&M, a dead baby, a dead fetus, etc.  And the \\"Nude with Mask\\" is a four-year-old girl. <br /> <br />* Among which are:  \\"Las Meninas, New Mexico\\" (1987) which was inspired by \\"The Family of Philip IV or 'Las Meninas' \\" (1656) by Diego Velzquez de Silva; \\"Gods of Earth and Heaven\\" (1988) which was inspired by \\"The Birth of Venus\\" (1485) by Botticelli; and \\"Studio of the Painter (Courbet), Paris\\" (1990) which was inspired by \\"The Artist's Studio: a Real Allegory of a Seven-Year Phase in My Artistic and Moral Life\\" (1855) by Gustave Courbet. <br /> <br />** Such as: \\"Joel-Peter Witkin: Forty Photographs\\" (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1985 & 1992); \\"Joel-Peter Witkin\\" (Twelvetrees Press, 1985); \\"Gods of Earth and Heaven\\" (Twelvetrees Press, 1989 & 1991); \\"Harms Way: Lust & Madness, Murder & Mayhem: A Book Of Photographs\\" (Twin Palms, 2nd ed., 1994); \\"Witkin\\" (with text by Germano Celant, Scalo, 1995); \\"The Bone House\\" (Twin Palms, 1998); and \\"Joel-Peter Witkin\\" (by Eugenia Parry, Phaidon, 2001).	2005-09-15

This book, one of the earliest by/about him*, may help you decide.  It complements a 1995-1996 exhibition which traveled from Museum Boijmans** van Beuningen (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) to capc Muse d'art contemporain (Bordeaux, France) and Kunsthalle Bern (Switzerland). Barney was involved in designing both the exhibition \\"of ten related [c.1990-1995] projects\\" and this book. <br />  <br />It does not resemble any exhibition catalog I've seen.  Starting from the outside, there is a translucent somewhat-stiff 16cm-high plastic wrap-around band with the title in a bold italic silvery font on both the front and back.  The book itself is paperback, 24cm by 17cm.  The front cover shows a photograph of a gynecologic speculum embedded in a tapered bar of what appears to be frozen Vaseline petroleum jelly (but may be plastic or wax).  The back cover shows the same photo as the front, but upside down, and with ISBN 90-6918-148-7 and UPC at lower right. The spine says \\"Matthew Barney PACE CAR for the HUBRIS PILL.\\" <br /> <br />The endpapers both have the same photo of what appears to be a flag with the Oakland Raiders football team logo on the left and \\"COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE\\" on the right.  The front and rear free endpapers would be pages \\"1\\" and \\"92\\" if they had been numbered. <br /> <br />Pages 5-8 have Acknowledgements; pages 9-19, an untitled essay by Neville Wakefield (which is on the obscure side, e.g., \\"...the hubris pill is offered as the intermediary or transporting agent to the bio-sculptural space the other side of hypertrophy\\"); and pages 21-35, an essay \\"Notes on Digestion and Film\\" by Richard Flood. Each of these texts is first given in Dutch*** then English. <br /> <br />Between pages 35 and 82 are unnumbered pages with uncaptioned images from CREMASTER 1, facility of INCLINE, OTTOshaft, facility of DECLINE, CREMASTER 4, and DRAWING RESTRAINT 7.  Here's where the going gets rough, in that these pages are difficult to appreciate without the essay \\"Only the Perverse Fantasy Can Still Save Us\\" by Nancy Spector on pages 3-91 of the book \\"Matthew Barney: The Cremaster Cycle\\" (which I'll call \\"CC\\") published by Guggenheim in 2002. I'll touch on the Cremaster sections only briefly (see CC for more details).  For the non-Cremaster sections, I'll give page numbers in the Spector essay as \\"CC14\\" etc. <br /> <br />\\"CREMASTER 1\\" (1995):  9 pages of photos.  The main feature is a black-and-white production photograph of Goodyear (i.e., Marti Domination) on a gatefold which opens to a large photo of the Goodyear chorus girls in Bronco stadium with photos of the air hostesses on the sides. <br /> <br />\\"facility of INCLINE\\" (1991): 3 pages.  Sternal retractor and hole close-up (aka \\"REPRESSIA, 1991 [detail]\\" per CC14), Jim Otto (aka \\"HYPOTHERMAL PENETRATOR, 1991\\" per CC11), and woman (aka \\"DELAY OF GAME [manual A], 1991 [detail]\\" per CC15). CC14 says that \\"INCLINE\\" took place in Los Angeles, and that in this version of the TRANSEXUALIS project, the Character of Positive Restraint wears \\"a West Coast... poolside number\\" as \\"camouflage to hide from Otto.\\" <br /> <br />\\"OTTOshaft\\" (1992):  3 full and 2 half pages. The main feature is a gatefold of Jayne Mansfield (?) on the left and Jim Otto with Super Bowl trophies on the right.  This opens up to a picture of someone walking down a curved hallway with the Otto character. Separate photos of \\"bagpipers\\" are on the sides. CC17 says about the OTTOshaft video:  \\"Otto and the Character of Positive Restraint plot to hijack the hubris pill... they impel the pill to travel from glucose... to pure sucrose.  After passing through petroleum jelly, it moves on to the starches -- tapioca -- and then meringue. If they are able to make it reach the state of pound cake... the bagpipe will play 'Amazing Grace' and thereby communicate with God.\\"  The \\"shaft\\" part of \\"OTTOshaft\\" refers to \\"various elevator shafts... [like the] drones of an enormous bagpipe.\\" <br /> <br />\\"facility of DECLINE\\" (1991): 3 pages.  Detail of \\"TRANSEXUALIS (decline), 1991\\" with silicon gel pectoral form, Otto character with mat, and woman (aka \\"Production photo from RADIAL DRILL, 1991\\" per CC15).   CC15 says that \\"DECLINE\\" took place in New York, and that the Character of Positive Restraint \\"undergoes similar transformations\\" to that in \\"facility of INCLINE,\\" but \\"here she disguises herself in elegant evening wear....\\" <br /> <br />\\"CREMASTER 4\\" (1994): 11 pages. The main feature is a gatefold of two settings of the Manx triskelion opening to a photo of Loughton Candidate flanked by photos of the Hacks. <br /> <br />\\"DRAWING RESTRAINT 7\\" (1993): 5 pages. Limousine interior, four satyr photos (2 color, 2 B&W). CC22 says the video shows two satyrs wrestling in a limousine \\"which is driving at night across and through the bridges the tunnels connecting Manhattan to the lands surrounding it.\\" (See also a separate out-of-print book on this video published in 1995 by Cantz.) <br /> <br />Pages 82 to 84 give a list of exhibits, which include some not illustrated by name in the book:  \\"Unit Bolus, 1989\\" (see CC6); \\"Anabol (A): Pace Car for the Hubris Pill, 1991\\" (despite the book's title!)****; \\"Drill Team: screw Bolus, 1991\\"; and \\"VERTICAL GAME, 1995\\". Pages 85 to \\"91\\" have the artist's exhibitions, a bibliography, credits, etc.  As the other reviewer here states, the book is unfortunately out of print (the edition was limited to 2500 copies).  Click the \\"Order it used\\" button at top right, and maybe a copy of this fascinating book will show up again on Amazon.com for you! <br /> <br />* \\"Matthew Barney: New Work, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art...\\" (1991) appears to be the first. <br />** Spelled \\"Boymans\\" in the book. <br />*** The WorldCat (OCLC) record says that the text is in \\"German and English,\\" which is incorrect. <br />**** The sculpture consists of \\"internally lubricated plastic,\\"\\"cast glucose capsule,\\" etc. and is apparently pictured on the right of the top figure of CC14.	2005-09-13
US	52793955	R359XXQSHWUP7B	3791330357	263411706	Sophie Calle: Did You See Me?	Books	5	20	20	N	Y	Great Overview of Her Work, Leaving You Wanting to Know More	Published to accompany a 2003-2004 Pompidou Centre retrospective, this is a wonderful overview of the artist's 1978-2003 work. The book is chock-full of photos and text, and is divided into front matter, \\"shadows, investigations, vanishings\\", \\"hotel rooms, sleepless nights and other true stories\\", \\"games and ceremonies\\", \\"journeys\\", \\"absence\\", \\"Unfinished, 2003\\", and appendices. <br /> <br />The front matter includes a brief foreword and preface, a thoughtful essay \\"The author issue...\\" by Christine Macel, and a rather haphazard essay \\"The paper tigress\\" by Yve-Alain Bois.  There are also 15 pages of excerpts (mainly in French) from Calle's 1978-1992 diaries. <br /> <br />The body of the book gives excerpts from about 30 of Calle's projects that take you on an emotional roller coaster ride. \\"Shadows, investigations, vanishings\\" starts with \\"Paris shadows, 1978-1979\\" in which Calle \\"followed strangers on the street.\\" Then there's a \\"Biographical interview with Sophie Calle\\" by Christine Macel.  \\"Suite venitienne, 1980\\" documents an intense following of a man visiting Venice. Calle contacted people listed in \\"The address book, 1983\\" that she found. \\"The shadow, 1981\\" and \\"Twenty years later, 2001\\" concern detective work. \\"A woman vanishes, 2003\\" is about the mysterious disappearance of a museum guard. \\"Beet, alfalfa, etc.\\" by Oliver Rolin concludes this section. <br /> <br />\\"Hotel rooms, sleepless nights and other true stories\\" includes:  \\"The sleepers, 1979\\" (people slept in her bed); \\"The hotel, 1981\\" (as a chambermaid, she photographed guests' belongings); \\"Bedroom, 2003,\\" \\"True stories, 1988-2003,\\" and \\"Appointment with Sigmund Freud, 1998\\" (\\"autobiographies\\" and associated places and objects); \\"Journey to California, 2003\\" (she sent her bed from France so a man could sleep in it); \\"Room with a view, 2002\\" (she spent a night in the Eiffel Tower listening to people's stories); and \\"Psychological assessment, 2003\\" (her mother, her friend, and she filled out forms which were given to a neuropsychologist and a psychiatrist to interpret). <br /> <br />The first two projects in \\"Games and ceremonies\\" are \\"The graves, 1990\\" (which consists of large photos of \\"plots\\" and made-up headstones) and \\"The striptease, 1979.\\" While those are perhaps depressing, the rest of this section is mostly delightful: \\"The birthday ceremony, 1980-1993\\" (she photographed all the presents she received on her birthdays), \\"Gotham handbook, 1994\\" (she \\"prettied up\\" a phone booth in New York), \\"The chromatic diet, 1997\\" (she ate foods of a single color each day), and \\"Days under the sign of B, C & W, 1998\\" (she spent time as a Big-time Blonde Bimbo, in the Cemetery, and on a Weekend in Wallonia). <br /> <br />\\"Journeys\\" consists of \\"The Bronx, 1980\\" (an exhibit covered in graffiti); \\"Anatoli, 1984\\" (train ride with a Russian man); \\"Los Angeles, 1984\\" (Calle asked people in L.A. \\"where are the angels?\\"); \\"No sex last night, 1992\\" (movie about a road trip with a male artist); \\"The Eruv of Jerusalem, 1996\\" (public spaces that have private meanings); \\"The detachment, 1996\\" (people's memories of East German symbols removed from Berlin); and \\"Exquisite pain, 1984-2003\\" (Calle asked people about the worst times of their lives). <br /> <br />\\"Absence\\" deals with the loss of sight or the loss of art. \\"The blind, 1986\\" and \\"Color blind, 1991\\" asked what is beautiful for blind people, or what they can see.  \\"Ghosts, 1989-1991\\" and \\"Last seen, 1991\\" asked for recollections of artwork loaned or stolen from museums. <br /> <br />The final project \\"Unfinished, 2003\\" is a sort of attempt to work through \\"writer's block.\\" Calle documents her struggles to make something artistic from a 1988 series of video surveillance tapes from an American bank. <br /> <br />Appendices include a list of Calle's works, exhibitions, books, articles, etc.  In addition, in the body of the book are notes as to where to find more info on projects if available; for example, \\"The striptease, 1979\\" was published with more material in \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\" (Fille du Docteur) of 1991, \\"Les Panoplies\\" of 1998, and \\"Double Game\\" of 1999.  It's nice to have such references, because the snippets of projects in this book make you want to read more about them.  But many of the projects in this book were previously unpublished, which adds to this book's unique value.  Get hold of it from Amazon.com! <br /> <br />BTW #1, here's a note on the book's title, which varies across bookstores and libraries.  The photographically illustrated front cover (showing Calle with her hand over her left eye) says only (on three lines in a box to the right) \\"SO / PHIE / CALLE\\".  The spine says the same.  The back cover (whose photo is a mirror image of the front cover) contains in a box to the left \\"M'AS-TU VUE / M'AS-TU VU(E) ?: / Did you see me? / ... Vain person. (fam.) show-off. ...\\".  The half-title page (just before the copyright page) has the same box of text as on the back cover.  The box on the title page (just after the copyright page) has five lines: \\"SO / PHIE / CALLE / M'AS-TU / VUE\\".  I therefore conclude that the title of this book, whose ISBN is given on the back cover and on the copyright page as 3-7913-3035-7, is best rendered as \\"Sophie Calle: M'as-tu Vue\\".  Although the book itself is mostly in English, this French phrase preserves the double meaning intended. <br /> <br />BTW #2, the paper types and sizes used in the book vary considerably, which adds to its charm.  The endpapers are salmon; the front matter is slightly gray; the diary pages are cream-colored; the section dividers (like \\"journeys\\") are pink; etc.  Some of the pages with photos are glossy, but others are matte.  Scattered between pages 84 and 281 are various pages attached to the spine but cut smaller than the 16.5x23.5 cm page size for the rest of the book.  Examples include a postcard after page 122, and a number of installation views such as \\"Gotham Handbook, 1994\\" before page 273.	2005-05-20
US	52793955	R1O9GP56EG9W9D	3822878669	702182275	One	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Interesting Concept; Don't Lose the Dust Jacket	This book, ISBN 3-8228-7866-9, is softcover (not \\"hardcover,\\" as Amazon would have it).  It's fairly big and heavy, at 27x22x4 cm and 2 kg. <br /> <br />What a concept, what a work of art!  The photos inside the book are all similar to the photo on the cover (the bottom part of which is obscured by a removable \\"obi band\\" in the Amazon picture above).  I'd guess there are 500 unnumbered pages, although I didn't count exactly.  The black and white, medium-high-contrast, grainy but sharp photos extend to the edges of the pages. Due to cropping, you see only the mouth, nose, eyes, and eyebrows (plus half of the forehead and sometimes a little hair hanging down over the forehead) of each person, meaning that the faces are magnified about four times life size. Judging from the flash reflections in the eyes and the fact that the facial features are in almost the same position on each page, I'd say the same photographic setup was used for all the pix.  Young, old; black, white, inbetween; oily, dry; female, male, indeterminate; almost-symmetric, fairly-asymmetric; blemished, clear --- the faces are diverse yet the same (hence the title \\"One\\"). It's somewhat like Bernhard and Hilla Becher's 1970 book Anonyme Skulpturen (Anonymous Sculptures) but with close-up people instead of far-away buildings. <br /> <br />The only words inside are \\"I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to all those who cooperated in this project. April 1st 1970 KEN OHARA\\" on the upper left of the inside front cover, as well as a box with copyright info superimposed on someone's nose on the inside back cover.  When you leaf through the book, you are alternately bored (due to the repetition), amazed (at the similarities and differences among the photos), and curious (about what the people might have been thinking and feeling, since their expressions are all fairly neutral, although some have a slight smile).  Get this thought-provoking book from Amazon.com! <br /> <br />BTW #1, although the outside of thedust jacket is similar to the cover of the book, the 19 cm wide flaps of the d.j. are important for understanding the book's contents. The front flap has text by Eric Kroll in English, German, and French: \\"There is an expression that if one were to stand at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 57th Street in Manhattan, everyone you know would eventually pass by. Ken Ohara's 'ONE' follows that concept. Shot in the mid 1960s on the streets of New York, it is a compelling visual meditation on mankind. Ohara's full bled images study those small things that make mankind unique. Stripped down to essentials, each page is eyes, nose, mouth, ears, or hair. Each page shows both the human mask and what lies beneath it. What is expressed in the mouth? What are the eyes saying? Each page is a visual equation and a riddle to which you will consistently return.  Originally published in a very limited edition in 1970, it is now available through Taschen to everyone. I tried to find the original edition and couldn't. Finally, I found one for over $ 300.  Taschen's edition can be bought for the price of a good mirror.\\" <br /> <br />The rear d.j. flap is two-sided.  The normally-visible side of the rear d.j. flap has four paragraph-length comments on the book by Hidemasa Hosoe (\\"A truly frightening book...\\"), Kenzo Nakajima (\\"... we feel that we have learned something about these people ...\\"), Kishin Shinoyama (\\"... Ohara would prefer not have [sic] this book described as a photographic volume; rather it is a New York telephone book of faces\\"), and Hiro (\\"... the faces merge and what arises is form, abstracted, dehumanized ...\\").  Lift up the rear d.j. flap, and the side not normally visible contains info about Ken Ohara (biography, exhibitions, publications, etc.).  I do not know if the 1970 original had a similar d.j., but I advise you not to lose the d.j. of the 1997 version! <br /> <br />BTW #2, as further evidence of its quality, the 1970 version is discussed in both \\"The Photobook:A History, Volume I\\" by Parr & Badger (2004) and \\"Open Book\\" of the Hasselblad Center and Arctic Paper (2004).	2005-04-23

In contrast, this book by Daido Moriyama shows what a great artist can do with photography. Furthermore, the book design is remarkable. <br /> <br />About 23x15x5 cm and 1.4 kg, '71-NY (not \\"1971/NY\\" as Amazon would have it) arrives in a corrugated brown cardboard slipcase. A black dust jacket has one small elliptical hole revealing blue underneath and one small circular hole revealing white underneath.  The soft cover of the book has horizontal blue and white stripes. It's over 400 pages in length (not \\"150\\" as Amazon would have it). <br /> <br />All the text in Japanese is translated into English and vice versa; the English versions are printed in landscape orientation in a typewriter-like font. The first three pages contain a letter from Moriyama to publisher and co-designer Andrew Roth.  Eighteen pages toward the end contain an excerpt from \\"Another Country\\" by James Baldwin, an interview with Moriyama, and an essay by Neville Wakefield. <br /> <br />Almost all the black-and-white photos shot in 1971 bleed to the edges of the pages. Most occupy entire two-page spreads, but some are only one page in size, and a few take up 1/2 or 1/3 of a page. All the photos are grainy, and many are blurry and/or not level. <br /> <br />Flipping through the book is like taking a wild ride through the big city.  We see buildings, people on the street, indoor self-portraits, television screen shots, etc.  I especially like the sequences of different shots of the same subject.  For example, there are four two-page spreads taken from the same vantage point showing the twin towers of the World Trade Center (still not yet fully occupied as of 1971) in the background.  Two half-page images and a two-page spread explore the same scene full of movie marquees with their bright lights.  Based on markings on the 14 sample pages of contact prints at the end, Moriyama chose carefully among his many negatives. <br /> <br />In the U.S., Moriyama is known through books that take his photos out of context, such as \\"Black Sun: the Eyes of Four: Roots and Innovation in Japanese Photography\\" by Holborn (1986), \\"Daido Moriyama: Stray Dog\\" by Phillips (1999), and \\"Daido Moriyama\\" by Nishii (2001, Phaidon 55 series).  Since most of his other great books such as \\"Bye, Bye, Photography, Dear\\" (Shashin Yo Sayonara) and \\"Japan: A Photo Theater\\" (Nippon Gejiko Shashincho) are out of print and quite expensive on the used market, this book provides an affordable opportunity to own a complete work by Moriyama. Don't wait until the limited edition of 3000 copies is sold out - buy '71-NY today from Amazon.com! <br /> <br />BTW, as further evidence of its quality, this book is discussed in both \\"The Photobook: A History, Volume I\\" by Parr & Badger (2004) and \\"Open Book\\" of the Hasselblad Center and Arctic Paper (2004).	2005-04-02
US	52793955	R1CA0Q7NP95HGM	0500203806	204152773	The Photograph as Contemporary Art (World of Art)	Books	4	57	65	N	Y	Info-Packed and Insightful (the 2nd [2009] Ed. Having 24 More Pages Than the 1st [2004] Ed.), With Only Minor Imperfections	UPDATE JANUARY 2010:  My review of the [[ASIN:0500203806 first (2004) edition]] is given verbatim below.  In the next paragraph I compare the first edition and the [[ASIN:0500204012 second (2009) edition]].    The first 217 pages of the 2nd ed. are different in only minor ways from the first 217 pages of the 1st ed.* However, pages 218-241 in the 2nd ed. contain a new final chapter 8, \\"Physical and Mental,\\" discussing photographic works for which \\"the very nature of the medium is part of the narrative of the work.\\" Among other topics, chapter 8 covers appropriation (e.g., rephotographing photographs); analog versus digital photography; and photographs in sculptures, collages, multimedia installations, books, and Web sites. Artists discussed in this chapter include James Welling, Isa Genzken, Walead Beshty, Zoe Leonard, An-My Le, Ed Ruscha, Rinko Kawauchi, and others. The writing style is similar to the first seven chapters, and is again of high quality.  The \\"Further Reading\\" list on pages 242-243 in the 2nd ed. has references as recent as 2009. In conclusion, if you own the 1st ed., you MAY wish to replace it with the 2nd ed., but it's not an absolute must.     * In specific, p.10 has a new paragraph summarizing the new final chapter, material on Sherrie Levine has been moved from p.214 to the new final chapter, and the paragraph on Vibeke Tandberg on p.217 is slightly reworded.    --- DECEMBER 14, 2004, REVIEW OF FIRST (2004) EDITION FOLLOWS ---    This information-packed paperback, which is relatively small for an art book, has an Introduction and seven chapters.  The Intro specifies that the book is a \\"the kind of overview you might experience if you visited exhibitions in a range of venues.\\"  After summarizing the chapters, the Intro concludes with descriptions of photographers who are \\"figureheads\\" or \\"cornerstones\\" of contemporary artistic photography:  Eggleston, Shore, the Bechers, Keita, Goldblatt, and Meatyard.    Chapter 1, \\"If This Is Art,\\" covers photos for which the artist has created an event prior to the shutter's being released.  Among the artists discussed are Philip-Lorca diCorcia and Erwin Wurm.  As a small problem, three of the photographs are reproduced at a rather small size (<15 square cm).    In Chapter 2, \\"Once Upon a Time,\\" the author writes of photography in which \\"narrative is loaded into a single frame,\\" which the author also calls \\"tableau photography.\\" The prototypic artist here is Jeff Wall.    The next two chapters are my least favorite in the book.  Chapter 3, \\"Deadpan,\\" concerns a \\"cool, detached and keenly sharp type of photography.\\"  Many of the \\"deadpan\\" photographers, such as Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth, were influenced by the Bechers and use large photos to convey their points.  Chapter 4, \\"Something and Nothing,\\" discusses still lifes, architecture, and nature shots that \\"push[] the boundaries of what might be considered a credible visual subject.\\"  Maybe I'm missing the point, but I fail to understand how many of the photos (e.g., of car panels in a doorway, a globe in a window, and a pink fabric bow) are artful.    Chapter 5's theme, \\"Intimate Life,\\" encompasses work by photographers such as Larry Clark, Nan Goldin, and Wolfgang Tillmans. Chapter 6's theme, \\"Moments in History,\\" does not relate to photojournalism, but rather to \\"aftermath photography\\" and the documentation of various groups of people in an almost anthropological fashion.  If Chapter 3 suffers from the book's inability to show the photos close to their full size, Chapters 5 and 6 suffer from the book's inability to show sequences of photos by each artist.    Chapter 7, \\"Revived and Remade,\\" is my favorite.  This concentrates on photographs that \\"exploit[] our pre-existing knowledge of imagery.\\"  Works by Joan Fontcuberta, Thomas Ruff, Cindy Sherman, Gillian Wearing, and others make one think hard about the nature of photography.    The back pages give references for further reading, a list of the over 200 photos(giving dimensions of the originals etc.), and an index of photographers (who hail from many countries).  Overall the book is well-written and insightful.  Don't miss this book at Amazon.com!	2004-12-15
US	52793955	R3D15HFGMEVVLR	1564661172	579841726	Subjective Realities	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	Book Design and Virtually All Photos Quite Interesting	The Refco Group is a financial services company whose collection of recent (i.e., mainly 1970s-2002) artistic photographs is highlighted in this catalog.  The book's overall design by \\"studio blue\\" is unique.  The clear plastic dust jacket contains the title and subtitle on the front and spine.  This partially encloses the stiff paper cover which extends only 2/3rds of the way to the edge and which consists only of a detail of a photo by Oliver Boberg, \\"Himmel [Sky] IV,\\" picturing \\"clouds\\" actually made of cotton.  The next layer visible through the dust jacket has the last names of the 96 artists; if you open the front or back cover, you see their first names.  The first 10 pages and last 10 pages are five sets of two-page spreads showing enlarged details of selected photos in the book. The main sections, separated by 2/3rd-width stiff papers, are: Wild Cards (7-page essay by Dave Hickey), Photography in the Refco Collection (10-page essay by Judith Russi Kirshner), Selected Works (arranged alphabetically by artist), and Checklist (including works in the collection but not in the book).  The essays in the front are illustrated with a half-dozen photos showing how some of the photographs in the collection are displayed in Refco's offices. <br /> <br />Some of the 115 photos did not impress me.  Despite three paragraphs of explanation, the photo of the back of a woman's head and neck by Jeanne Dunning seemed banal.  The significance of the luthier's window by Patrick Faigenbaum eluded me.  Rodney Graham's photo of a tree, other than being upside-down, was not special.  The portrait of a woman by Jitka Hanzlova did not communicate any meaning. The headshots by David Robbins are not inherently worthy of note unless one is familiar with the artists portrayed (like Ashley Bickerton or Robbins himself).  I couldn't connect with Thomas Schutte's image of a small sculpture of a man's head, nor with Beverly Semmes's image of a mysterious red figure in a boat.  Seton Smith'sblurry photos of a room as reflected in two mirrors reminded me of Uta Barth, but without her aesthetic sense.  I'm not very familiar with any of these photographers' bodies of work, so perhaps I would have appreciated the photographers more if the book contained other examples of their photographs. <br /> <br />However, virtually all the other photos in the book are quite interesting from a conceptual viewpoint in that they \\"call the ethics and veracity of the photograph into question.\\"  Besides the artists listed in the Editorial Review, the following are noteworthy: Marina Abramovic, Vanessa Beecroft, James Casebere, Maurizio Cattelan, Thomas Joshua Cooper, Thomas Demand, Elger Esser, Seiichi Furuya, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Louise Lawler, Tracey Moffatt, Shirin Neshat, Walter Niedermayr, Gabriel Orozco, Sigmar Polke, Michal Rovner, Sam Taylor-Wood, Gillian Wearing, and James Welling.

The photographers include Ansel Adams, Diane Arbus, Eugne Atget, Mathew Brady, Brassa, Julia Margaret Cameron, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Imogen Cunningham, Roy DeCarava, Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, Ralph Gibson, Lewis Hine, Andr Kertsz, William Klein, Dorothea Lange, Ralph Meatyard, Lisette Model, Lszl Moholy-Nagy, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, Irving Penn, Man Ray, Jacob Riis, Alexander Rodchenko, August Sander, Cindy Sherman, Aaron Siskind, Edward Steichen, Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Josef Sudek, William Henry Fox Talbot, Edward Weston, and Garry Winogrand. <br /> <br />The photos are nicely reproduced, better than in many exhibition catalogs. A handful of the plates are in color, and the rest are duotone black & white.  The nationality, birth date, and death date of each photographer are given, which is helpful.  I would have liked to see more text for each work (besides the title, date, medium, and dimensions), since the 14 pages of text specifically mention only one-third of the plates. It would also have been nice for the photos to be reproduced in sizes \\"more or less proportionate to those of the prints\\" as in \\"Ansel Adams at 100\\" of 2001. Instead, some small prints in reality are large in the book, and vice versa. Finally, the photos were made from 1843 to 1994, but the order of the photos in the book is 1850, 1848, 1843, 1854, 1850, ... , 1994, 1975, 1990, 1983, 1976, 1984, 1989, 1987, 1991, 1984, 1979, and 1991-1992.  I did not see a strong reason to vary from a strict chronological order, although it was interesting that some photos facing each other were visually related (e.g., \\"strong background light,\\" \\"shadow over part of photo\\") or thematically related (e.g., \\"children playing,\\" \\"men with hats\\"). <br /> <br />Overall, the book provides a good exploration of the history of photography.

The 17 artists in the first section of photos are presented in apparently random order.  The complete set of 32 artists - Vito Acconci,  Vincenzo Agnetti, John Baldessari, Robert Barry, Joseph Beuys, Heiner Blum, Victor Burgin, Willie Doherty, Bernard Faucon, Hamish Fulton, Jochen Gerz, Gilbert & George, Jenny Holzer, Douglas Huebler, Peter Hutchinson, On Kawara, Karen Knorr, Joseph Kosuth, Barbara Kruger, Ketty La Rocca, Marie-Jo Lafontaine, Louise Lawler, Jean Le Gac, Ken Lum, Urs Lthi, Duane Michals, Maurizio Nannucci, Shirin Neshat, Laura Padgett, Giulio Paolini, Olivier Richon, and Klaus Staeck - in the second section of photos are in alphabetical sequence.  I don't see why the all photos couldn't have been in chronological or alphabetical order, or grouped by some sort of themes. <br /> <br />Second, some photographers using words in their works have been omitted.  I'm thinking of John Hilliard's \\"Cause of Death,\\" Carrie Mae Weems's \\"Sea Island Series,\\" David Wojnarowicz's \\"[One day this kid...]\\", etc.  Of course, the curators had to make choices in selecting the works, and mostly their choices were sound. <br /> <br />A 3rd problem is that some of the text in the photos is difficult to understand. In many works (e.g., on pages 27, 30, 41, 63-64, 86, 88, 94-95, 107-109, and 115-119) the text is not translated from Farsi, French, German, Greek, and Italian. In some works (e.g., on pages 16, 61, and 91) the text is too small. <br /> <br />Finally, some of the artists' statements (e.g., on pages 127-129, 131-132, 135-138, and 140-143) are untranslated.  The preface and the two essays were apparently translated from German by John S. Southard; one would think that the publisher could have paid for a translation of the artists' statements as well. <br /> <br />Despite the problems mentioned above, however, the book occupies a unique niche in that I am unaware of other books that deal specifically with the use of words in photography.

It is the catalog of an exhibition (the first in a planned series of triennials) held September-November 2003.  The curators \\"realized that many artists were leaving the studio and going out into public to engage people who were unknown to them as part of their art-making activity\\" and hence titled the exhibition \\"Strangers.\\" The exhibition was \\"largely planned and carried out in the period following September 11, 2001, when the issue of fear and trust among people in public spaces seemed unavoidable.\\"<br /><br />The 40 artists (not 50 as stated in the Synopsis and Product Description above) are Francis Alÿs, Olivo Barbieri, Yto Barrada, Chien-Chi Chang, Leif Claesson, Nancy Davenport, Luc Delahaye, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Rineke Dijkstra, Harun Farocki, Coco Fusco, David Goldblatt, Ren&eacute;e Green, Julie Henry, Bill Henson, Ben Judd, Justine Kurland, Jana Leo, Liu Zheng, Tim Maul, Susan Meiselas, Zwelethu Mthethwa, Matthias M&uuml;ller, Shirin Neshat, Yoshua Okon, Richard Renaldi, Julika Rudelius, John Schabel, Collier Schorr, Zineb Sedira, Kiki Seror, Bruno Serralongue, Efrat Shvily, Eyal Sivan, Joel Sternfeld, Beat Streuli, Fiona Tan, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Sharon Yaari, and Shizuku Yokomizo. They were born between 1930 and 1979 with an \\"average\\" of 1959.  It's an international group, with 15 born in Europe, 14 in North America, and the others in Australia, China, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, South Africa and Taiwan.<br /><br />The 248 pages (not 288 as stated in the Product Details above) alternate between essays (pages 12-18, 60-63, 105-136 [older writings on strangers printed on yellow-green background], 178-184, 226-230) and \\"artist pages\\" (20-59, 64-103, 138-177, 186-225).  For each artist, one page is devoted to a review of his/her recent work and a description of the works in the exhibition; three pages are devoted to reproductions of the works themselves.  Between the well-chosen images and the well-written text, I felt I had a pretty good idea of the artists' works. The medium for each work is given in the back, as are a list of exhibitions and a bibliography for each photographer or video artist.<br /><br />Some of the works stretch the theme of the exhibition; for example, Davenport's and Shvily's architectural shots do not show any people in them, so it's a leap to say that they concern \\"strangers.\\"  Nevertheless, the book is attractively designed and fascinating, and makes me interested in seeing the next International Center of Photography triennial in 2006.

Photography Overview, But Title Is Problematic	This paperback accompanies an exhibition that was held at the Museum of New Mexico between October 2002 and January 2003.  It's too bad that this museum is not as well known as (say) the Whitney or the Guggenheim in New York, and that the editors (Steve Yates and Siegfried Halus) are not as famous as (say) John Szarkowski, because the book is a must for people who are interested in artistic photography.<br /><br />The core of the book consists of almost 100 pages of 1905-1999 color and black & white photographs, collages, and montages categorized under the headings \\"Early to Late Modernism\\" and \\"After Modernism.\\" Under \\"Early to Late Modernism\\" (pp.16-91) we find the thematic groups \\"Proto-Modern Photography,\\" \\"Limitations of the Medium,\\" \\"Modern Form in Architecture, Landscape & Portraiture,\\" \\"Photogram Aesthetic,\\" \\"Constructed to Be Photographed,\\" \\"Self as Subject and Simulacra,\\" \\"Beyond Realism,\\" \\"Cultural Landscape,\\" and \\"Postmodern Appropriation.\\" Under \\"After Modernism\\" (pp.92-115) we find the thematic groups \\"From the Avant-Garde,\\" \\"Beyond the Medium,\\" and \\"Feminism as Ethos.\\" The works are from Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe, the Princeton University Art Museum, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.  There is a note that \\"not all images in the exhibition appear in this catalog.\\"<br /><br />The photographers (or artists using photography) include Berenice Abbott, Ansel Adams, Robert Adams, Max Alpert, Eleanor Antin, Dieter Appelt, Karl Baden, Lewis Baltz, Rudolph Baranik, Thomas Barrow, Irene Bayer-Hecht, Bernd Becher, Hilla Becher, Michael Berman, Mieczyclaw Berman, Jayne Hinds Bidaut, Ilse Bing, Christian Boltanski, Margaret Bourke-White, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Marilyn Bridges, Francis Brugui&egrave;re, Vladimir Brylyakov, Harry Callahan, John Candelario, Paul Caponigro, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Walter Chappell, Sarah Charlesworth, Natasha Cherkashin, Valery Cherkashin, Larry Clark, William Clift, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Van Deren Coke, John Collier Jr.,Linda Connor, Robert H.

White, Minor White, Joel-Peter Witkin, and Georgii Zelma.<br /><br />The book has 14 pages of front matter, including 4- and 2-page essays by the editors.  Some 36 pages in the back contain the media and dimensions of each work, and a one-paragraph biography and bibliography for each artist written by students.  The book is valuable as an overview of 20th century photography, and provides higher resolution for the photos than the exhibition's Web site.  I would have liked to see more text giving a context for each work; for example, in the back matter someone could have mentioned that Witkin's \\"Las Meninas\\" relates to the Velasquez painting of the same name.<br /><br />In my mind, the book's biggest problem is its title.  I'm failing to see what \\"idea\\" has to do with the book or its contents.  Is there any photography that does not deal with ideas in some way?  And if \\"After Modernism\\" is part of the title, why does the vast majority of the book deal with \\"Early to Late Modernism\\"?  Finally, what is modernism to the editors, anyway?  They fail to define the term as they see it.<br /><br />Despite the puzzle of the title, buy this book from Amazon.com!	2004-10-23

The photographic image is central to contemporary art and the debates that surround it, yet it took most of the last century for it to acquire this status. Despite the extensive exploration of photography as an independent art in the Modernist era, it was not until the late twentieth century that artists, museums and galleries began to explore its social roles as a medium of representation. This volume provides a comprehensive survey of photography's place in recent art history, further contextualized in the Documents section by original artists' statements and interviews, together with critical and theoretical reflections on the photographic and the art of the photograph.\\" <br /> <br />Does the book live up to this hype?  I think it does.  It's a handsome 304-page tome, with the first two-thirds printed on white semiglossy paper (for the \\"Survey\\" and \\"Works\\") and the last third on cream-colored uncoated paper (for the \\"Documents,\\" biographies, bibliography, and index). <br /> <br />The \\"Survey,\\" \\"Works,\\" and \\"Documents\\" parts are arranged into the same eight sections: \\"Memories and Archives\\" on \\"public and private histories\\"; \\"Objective Objects\\" on photos' \\"apparently direct relation to the world\\"; \\"Traces of Traces\\" on \\"photography as a record of the real and its effects\\"; \\"The Urban and the Everyday\\" on \\"contemporary city life\\"; \\"The Studio Image\\" on \\"fine art's traditional space of making\\"; \\"The Arts of Reproduction\\" on \\"works that reflect upon the way mass culture is experienced as fragments\\"; \\" 'Just' Looking\\" on \\"the social structures of vision and the place of the gaze in the formation of our identity\\"; and \\"The Cultures of Nature\\" on \\"how the current understandings of the natural are formed and reflected through contemporary representation.\\" This organization is unique to my knowledge; most books on art are arranged chronologically or by artist. <br /> <br />The \\"Survey\\" essay by David Campany places the Works and Documents into historical context and explains in some detail the eight categories.  It's illustrated with small reproductions of art and photos.  I found it enlightening. <br /> <br />Within each of the eight sections of \\"Works,\\" from pages 46 to 205, the photos are presented in more or less chronological order, with the earliest works dating from the 1960s.  Of the dozens of photographers, the ones who have more than one photo (from different series) reproduced in the book are John Baldessari, Victor Burgin, Gregory Crewdson, John Divola, John Hilliard, Joel Meyerowitz, Gabriel Orozco, Richard Prince, Gerhard Richter, Martha Rosler, Thomas Ruff, Allan Sekula, Cindy Sherman, Thomas Struth, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Larry Sultan, Jeff Wall, Andy Warhol, Gillian Wearing, and William Wegman.  I detect no significant errors of omission or commission in the choice of artists.  The specifications of media (e.g., \\"tinted black and white photographs\\") and dimensions, and the lengthy captions, are valuable. <br /> <br />\\"Documents\\" contains excerpts of writings by photographers (including ones with only a single photograph in \\"Works,\\" e.g., Yve Lomax and Robert Smithson) and non-photographers (e.g., Roland Barthes, Jacque Derrida, Craig Owens, Marcel Proust), as well as interviews with photographers.  These \\"mostly left-brain\\" texts complement the \\"half-left-brain, half-right-brain\\" Works. <br /> <br />If I had to improve anything, I would say to editor Campany and publisher Phaidon only \\"Lay off the fancy typography, like the 'decreasing font size' effect from page 14 to page 17, and the full-page treatment of brief quotations on pages 221, 226, 235, and 283!  While it makes the book visually attractive, it distracts from the book's main messages and wastes space.\\"  Buy this excellent book from Amazon.com!	2004-10-02

In Czech and English, it contains an Introduction; an OK essay \\"Photography at the Beginning of a New Epoch...\\"; an overly-detailed \\"Chronology of Czech Photography 1990-1998\\"; and an informative essay \\"Certainty and Searching in Contemporary Czech Photography.\\"  These are followed by almost 150 pages containing a brief biography of and reproductions of several works by each of the 33 featured photographers. Most of the photographs are in black and white, but about a dozen are in color, and all are well reproduced and striking.  I would characterize three quarters of the photos as \\"artistic\\" and one quarter as \\"documentary,\\" although there is some overlap between the two categories.  The book concludes with a bibliography and notes on the curators (only in Czech). <br /> <br />I found the book a little frustrating because the English translations are somewhat difficult to read and because there is no table of contents or index. Here are the page numbers for the bios and works of the featured photographers: Pavel Banka 182-187; Jaroslav Barta 192-195; Michaela Brachtlova 152-155; Veronika Bromova 138-141; Karel Cudlin 90-93; Jiri David 116-119; Jiri Hanke 120-123; Pavel Hecko 106-109; Bohdan Holomicek 66-69; Lukas Jasansky and Martin Polak 172-175; Vaclav Jirasek 162-165; Viktor Kolar 80-85; Josef Koudelka 59-65; Antonin Kratochvil 94-97; Jaroslav Kucera 70-73; Ales Kunes 180-183; Zdenek Lhotak 124-127; Michal Macku 156-161; Pavel Mara 142-145; Tomki Nemec 98-101; Ivan Pinkava 110-115; Vaclav Podesat 86-89; Jan Pohribny 128-131; Rudo Prekop 188-191; Jaroslav Rajzik 200-203; Jan Reich 196-199; Jan Saudek 132-137; Robert Silverio 176-179; Tono Stano 146-151; Igor Sefr 102-105; Jindrich Streit 74-79; and Miro Svolik 166-171. <br /> <br />Some 1990s \\"thumbnail\\" photos accompanying the essays at the beginning ofthe book seemed artistically fascinating, especially those by Roman Sejkot (pp.10, 51), Tomas Pospech (p.34), Jaroslav Malik (p.37), Petr Weigl (p.48), and Jan Splichal (p.56).  It's unfortunate that the book could not devote more space to these five artists. <br /> <br />Despite the glitches mentioned above, the book gives a glimpse into the work of many great contemporary Czech photographers.

It's similar to the book \\"Focus on Rashomon\\" published in 1972 by Prentice-Hall and also edited by Donald Richie.  Both contain a 20+ page essay by Richie originally from \\"The Films of Akira Kurosawa,\\" as well as the short stories by Akutagawa (\\"Rashomon\\" and \\"In a Grove\\") that form the basis of the film.  Also in both books are various reviews and commentaries, including \\"Rashomon and the Japanese Cinema\\" by Curtis Harrington; \\"Rashomon and the Fifth Witness\\" by George Barbarow; \\"Rashomon as Modern Art\\" by Parker Tyler; \\"Memory of Defeat in Japan: a  Reappraisal of Rashomon\\" by James Davidson; and \\"Rashomon\\" by Tadao Sato.  (Some reviews and commentaries - by Farber, Gadi, Ghelli, Iwasaki, Mercier, Time Magazine, Young, and Zunser- are in the 1972 book but not this one.  I didn't feel that any of these were crucial.) <br /> <br />Improving upon the 1972 compilation, however, this 1987 Rutgers volume contains:  (1) An essay by Audie Bock, \\"Kurosawa: His Life and Art.\\"  (2) A 57-page continuity script. This is similar to pages 11-169 of the book \\"Rashomon; a film by Akira Kurosawa from the filmscript by Akira Kurosawa and Shinobu Hashimoto\\" published in 1969 by Grove Press, except that there are fewer stills and the duration of each of the 407 shots is not given.

I count 142 different species or subspecies.  The last panel has 22 \\"birding hotspots and sanctuaries\\" on 4 islands.  It's not intended for serious birding, but birdwatchers may wish to carry it to show non-birders what they are supposed to be seeing.<br />If I could advise the author and Waterford Press, I would suggest: (1) Update the common names and species according to the \\"Checklist of the Birds of Hawaii - 2002\\" that is available on the Hawaii Audubon Society Web site. For example: \\"Warbling Silverbill (Lonchura malabarica) has been changed to African Silverbill (Lonchura cantans).\\"  (2) Add more native Hawaiian names for the birds.  (3) Delete birds that are fairly common all over the U.S. (e.g., mallards, rock doves [pigeons], and house sparrows).  (4) Add a note or code to indicate which of the remaining species are endangered or threatened.*  For example, Hawaiian Goose (Nene), Hawaiian Duck (Koloa), Hawaii Petrel ('Ua'u), Newell's Shearwater ('A'o), Hawaiian Coot ('Alae Ke'oke'o), Black-Necked Stilt (the subspecies listed is the Hawaiian Stilt, A'eo), Peregrine Falcon, Hawaiian Hawk ('Io), Hawaiian Crow ('Alala), 'Oloma'o, Kama'o, Puaiohi, Kauai 'O'o, 'O'u, Palila, Maui Parrotbill, Nukupu'u, 'Akepa, Hawaii Creeper, Oahu Creeper, 'Akohekohe, and Po'ouli are endemic birds that fall into this category.  (5) Add the 'Oma'o (Hawai'i Thrush, Myadestes obscurus) and 'Akikiki (Kauai Creeper, Oreomystis bairdi), which are non-threatened endemic* Hawaiian birds found on the Big Island and Kauai respectively. Also add the endemic 'Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis), whose Hawai'i and Kaua'i subspecies are not threatened.<br />Buy this from Amazon.com!<br />* BTW, it's sad that so few Hawaiian birds that are endemic (i.e., that evolved and breed in Hawaii but nowhere else) are neither threatened nor endangered.  Besides the 'Oma'o, 'Akikiki, and 'Elepaio mentioned above, the ones on the card are: Hawaiian Noddy (Anous minutus melanogenys, native name Noio, a subspecies of Black Noddy); Hawaiian Owl (Pueo); 'Anianiau; various 'Amakihi's; Maui 'Alauahio (Paroreomyza montana newtoni, a.k.a. Maui Creeper); 'Akeke'e; 'I'iwi; and 'Apapane.  The other birds neither threatened nor endangered are human-introduced &quot;aliens,&quot; indigenous (i.e., arrived and established themselves on their own), or just visitors.Chasiempis sandwichensis), whose Hawai'i and Kaua'i subspecies are not threatened.<br />Buy this from Amazon.com!<br />* BTW, it's sad that so few Hawaiian birds that are endemic (i.e., that evolved and breed in Hawaii but nowhere else) are neither threatened nor endangered.

US	52793955	R2W0BTA29T4KV3	013184105X	985027347	History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Photography (5th Edition)	Books	4	97	98	N	Y	Needs More &amp; Better Color; Not Really Improved Over 4th Ed.	I borrowed the 1998 4th edition, which got generally excellent reviews here at Amazon and elsewhere, for comparison.  Like the previous edition, this fifth edition is big (9&quot;x12&quot;x2&quot;) and heavy (9 pounds). The chapters, bibliography, glossary, index, and credits take up 832 pages, about the same as the previous edition. Arnason died in 1986; for this edition, Peter Kalb is given as the &quot;revising author,&quot; although the preface states that Michael Bird revised chapters 1-24.  I couldn't find either Kalb's or Bird's institutional affiliation listed on the book or the dust jacket, which is odd since the 4th edition had a photo of and a paragraph about revising author Marla F. Prather on its jacket.<br />The chapter titles are largely unchanged: 1 The Sources (was &quot;Prehistory&quot;) of Modern Painting; 2 Realism, Impressionism, and Early Photography; 3 Post-Impressionism; 4 The Origins of Modern Architecture and Design; 5 Art Nouveau and the Beginnings of Expressionism (was just &quot;Art Nouveau&quot;); 6 The Origins of Modern Sculpture; 7 Fauvism; 8 Expressionism in Germany; 9 The Figurative Tradition in Early Twentieth-Century Sculpture; 10 Cubism; 11 Futurism, Abstraction in Russia, and de Stijl (was &quot;Towards Abstraction&quot;); 12 Early Twentieth-Century Architecture; 13 From Fantasy to Dada and the New Objectivity; 14 The School of Paris After World War I (was &quot;...Between the Wars&quot;); 15 Surrealism; 16 Modern Architecture Between the Wars; 17 International Abstraction Between the Wars; 18 American Art Before World War II; 19 Abstract Expressionism and the New American Sculpture; 20 Postwar European Art; 21 Pop Art and Europe's New Realism; 22 Sixties Abstraction; 23 The Second Wave of International Style Architecture; 24 The Pluralistic Seventies; 25 Postmodernism in Architecture; 26 The Retrospective Eighties (25 &amp; 26 were swapped); 27 Resistance and Resolution (was &quot;Epilogue&quot;).<br />As pluses, I have been unable to find any other book of this scope from the 1800s to the present, and the text is perhaps somewhat easier to read than in the previous edition.  As minuses:  (1) There is little discussion of artists with heavy non-Western influences, with some exceptions (such as Cai Guoqiang [China], Ghada Amer [Egypt], Shirin Neshat [Iran], Mariko Mori [Japan], Yinka Shonibare [Nigeria], Shazia Sikander [Pakistan], Mona Hatoum [Lebanon], and Yasumasa Morimura [Japan], the last two having been in the previous edition).  (2) The 4th edition had color plates on pages separate from the black-and-white plates, with two distinct types of paper.  All pages of the current book are on the same type of paper, obviating the need for separate color plates; however, many of the plates that were B&amp;W in the 4th ed. are still B&amp;W, which leads to an odd effect. What is the purpose of having two Matisses in color and one B&amp;W on page 274; one work by Jasper Johns in color and one B&amp;W on page 486; etc.?  I would have liked to see less B&amp;W.  (3) Although the paintings are reproduced well, the quality of some color photographs is pathetic.  Case in point: Jeff Wall's &quot;A Sudden Gust of Wind (After Hokusai) on page 760, which looks pretty much the same in the previous edition.  It's as though someone deliberately underexposed the photo and gave it a green color cast, compared with reproductions in other books.  Other bad examples of color correction (guys, use some Photoshop!) can be found on pages 98, 341, 451, 490, 543, 544, 564, 614, and 633.<br />(4) Finally, I don't see a definite improvement in coverage over the 4th edition.  Let's take chapter 26 (&quot;The Retrospective Eighties&quot;) as an example.  Compared with the corresponding chapter in the 4th edition, the following artists were deleted:  Arneson, Burton, Greenblat, Hodgkin, Hunt, Kapoor, Otterness, Saar, Snyder, and Wilmarth.  The following artists are still in the chapter, but with fewer works of art reproduced: Arnajani, Baselitz, Bleckner, Chia, Clemente, Cragg, Cucchi, Fischl, Haring, Holzer, Levine, Lipski, Lupertz, Murray, Penck, Pfaff, Puryear, Scharf, Scully, Sherman, and Spero.  The following artists have been added:  Antoni, Bickerton, Fleury, McCollum, Osorio, Prince, Steinbach, Taaffe, and Wong.  So although this edition is &quot;different,&quot; it's not necessarily &quot;better.&quot; If you already have the 4th, you don't necessarily need the 5th ed.<br />But if you have only the 3rd edition, or have never had a previous edition, buy the book from Amazon.com!<br />BTW, it's unclear whether the Prentice-Hall people have read their own book.  Their Web site says the book uses &quot;full color throughout,&quot; that chapter 27 on Resistance and Resolution &quot;includes a section on Feminism,&quot; and that the &quot;Section in Chapter 24 on Art and Politics brings the story of modern art up to the year 2000.&quot;  None of these statements is entirely true.  The first I've already discussed; feminist art is largely covered on pages 599-604 in chapter 24, with only one feminist artist (Amer) in chapter 27; and pages 683-684 in chapter 25 cover post-9/11 work from 2002, with the sections on politics in chapters 24 and 27 dealing with the 70's and 90's respectively.	2004-03-27

It begins with 30 pages of essays: &quot;Introduction,&quot; &quot;Picturing Movement, Past and Present,&quot; and &quot;Art Photography after Photography.&quot; These essays do an excellent job of placing the exhibition in context.  In addition, they mention works in a smaller 2002-2003 version of the exhibition in New York, which included some artists (e.g., Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman, Nam June Paik, and Robert Smithson) not represented in the Bilbao exhibition.<br />The body of the book (&quot;Catalogue Entries&quot;) consists of text about and photographs or video stills by 50 artists in alphabetical order (Marina Abramovic through Jane and Louise Wilson). Each of the artists is given up to one page of text.  For most of the artists there is only one page of images, but Francis Alys, Matthew Barney, Miles Coolidge, Gregory Crewdson, Rineke Dijkstra, Olafur Eliasson, Peter Fischli / David Weiss, Anna Gaskell, Nan Goldin, Douglas Gordon, Andreas Gursky, Ann Hamilton, Inigo Manglano-Ovalle, Mariko Mori, Aika Noguchi, Catherine Opie, Gabriel Orozco, Pipilotte Rist, Michal Rovner, Thomas Struth, Sam Taylor-Wood, Wolfgang Tillmans, and Kara Walker have at least three pages. Some works by Dijkstra, Gaskell, Goldin, Gursky, Anthony Hernandez, Manglano-Ovalle, Mori, Orozco, Rovner, Thomas Ruff, Taylor-Wood, and Tillmans are not reproduced in the book but were in the exhibition (per the list on pages 205-216).  Virtually all of the works are dated 1990-2002; some images of Goldin's were taken in the 1970s and 1980s but were published later.  For each artist, 2-4 &quot;selected readings&quot; are listed in the back of the book.<br />The photography is mostly great, but the book does not really do the videos justice for a couple reasons.  First, there are not enough stills to give the reader a good idea of the course of each video.  I would have preferred a larger number of smaller-sized stills.  Second, the one-page-of-text limit for each video artist gives the same amount of space for the massive Cremaster series by Barney as for a three-minute video by Patty Chang.  You'll have to travel to Spain to fully appreciate the videos, but meanwhile buy the book from Amazon.com!Second, the one-page-of-text limit for each video artist gives the same amount of space for the massive Cremaster series by Barney as for a three-minute video by Patty Chang.

US	52793955	R4K7VGRALQQ5P	1886212198	938012637	American Photography 19	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Photo Lover�s Delight - If You Can Tolerate the Book Design	Like the previous books in the American Photography series, this one presents the winners in an open juried competition.  The photos had to have been published or taken in 2002.  Only those \\"selected\\" photos with a majority vote of the six-person panel were reproduced in the book; those \\"chosen\\" with two votes are only on a Web site.<br />I am not fond of several aspects of this book. First, the designers have apparently decreed that there shall be no unused space on any of the pages. Therefore, you see on the right side of some pages a duplicate of the left side of the photograph on the next page, and you see on the left side of some pages a duplicate of the right side of the photograph on the preceding page. I find this distracting rather than artful. Second, many of the photos are turned sideways. This causes you to have to frequently rotate the 6-pound, 9\\"x12\\"x1\\" book 90 degrees to no good purpose.  Third, the placement of the (sideways) captions in a section after the plates requires you to flip back and rotate to discover the significance of some scenes. A good example is the set of Sicilian mummies by Paolo Ventura which is confusing without the caption.  I would have preferred captions next to the images.  Fourth, two jury members (Harris, Ryan) were editors for some of the photos in the book, and one jury member (Crewdson) shot some of the photos in the book.  It's not clear that they recused themselves from voting on their own work.  Finally, I do not like the inclusion of obvious digital photo illustrations or of video captures (as in \\"key frame[] from the video... of people reacting to Ground Zero World Trade Center site\\" on the book's cover).  To me these are not really still photography.<br />Nevertheless, this book has a number of extraordinary photographs, all reproduced in a large format.  Besides the 9/11-related pictures, among the most remarkable are the following.  In photo 63 by Henrik Knudsen (\\"Pool\\") we see the back of a man standing in the water with a woman's hands around his back (it's ambiguous whether he is loving or killing her).  Hans Neleman in photo 110 (from a \\"Body Transformed\\" project that apparently has yet to be published) shows a nude woman who has burns on her shoulder and some markings on her back and who is lying in a chair; it's reminiscent of an oil painting.  Photo 147 of Fredrik Broden depicts two chairs in a \\"suggestive pose.\\" Rodney Smith's photo 232 has a woman doing a painting on a canvas of her own back (\\"even the blind people can draw\\").  Beach volleyball has a completely new look in photo 238 by Claudio Edinger. The portrait of the really strong young boy with a samurai sword by Danielle Levitt (which Amazon has chosen for the graphic on this page) is found large and sideways as photo 311, but is not on the cover.<br />You'll find a lot to like about the book.  Buy it at Amazon.com!<br />BTW Number 1, here's a quick rundown of the previous four years of American Photography.<br />#18 (2002, cow saying \\"cheese\\" on the cover, but Amazon graphic is a painted portrait of a Taliban soldier with sunglasses): The best design of the bunch. Photos grouped into sections such as \\"sexxx,\\" \\"2by2\\" (animals), and \\"911\\"; interesting juxtapositions of work by different photogs on facing pages. Don't have to rotate the book to read captions.<br />#17 (2001, ketchup packet on the cover, but Amazon graphic is a computer classroom): Notable for some photos whose meanings are quite obscure, sometimes due to inadequate captions (e.g., per a Web site #297 by Ron Haviv is a photo of a photo of a Muslim family that was methodically defaced presumably by Serbs, but this is not stated in the book).  Captions are sideways.<br />#16 (2000, toy car on stove burner on the cover, but Amazon graphic is two children at a pool): Great photographs by Gilles Peress, Larry Sultan, and others, but I'm not sure why Ariko Inaoka got eight pages. Don't have to rotate the book to read captions.<br />#15 (1999, multi-colored vertical stripe on the cover, but Amazon graphic is a baseball player):  Some attention-grabbing abstract, conceptual, and experimental shots. Captions are sideways.<br />BTW Number 2, some photogs get published in AP year after year.  Here's my list of those who had \\"selected\\" photos in #17 of 2001, #18 of 2002, and #19 of 2003: Josef Astor, Nelson Bakerman, Chris Buck, Craig Cutler, Jim Erickson, Larry Fink, Katy Grannan, Lauren Greenfield, Kyoko Hamada, Mark Heithoff, Antonin Kratochvil, Hugh Kretschmer, Catherine Ledner, Robbie McClaran, Greg Miller, Frank W.

The first two deal with Brassaï and Kertész, who were active in the early part of the twentieth century. The next two concern the parallel between creativity in mathematics and in photography, and the importance of narrative in photography. The author concludes by musing on late photographs (or sets of photos) from three outstanding photographers: \\"Point Lobos\\" by Edward Weston (1944), the \\"Equivalents\\" series of clouds by Stieglitz (1920s - early 1930s), and \\"Fall in Movement\\" by Strand (1973).  Some 10 pages of notes follow the 162 pages of text.<br />I found the book thought-provoking, and many of the photographs were new to me, but the book could have been improved in the following ways. First, an index would have enabled the reader to find specific passages or artworks of interest. For example, one might like to see again the paragraphs on Poincaré on pages 74-75, or the photos by Sternfeld on pages 80 and 85. Second, it would have been nice to know the dimensions of the original photographs. A work that is only a few square inches in size will have a different impact than one that covers an entire wall. Third, virtually the entire book discusses creations by white men; it would have been nice to introduce some diversity in race and gender. Finally, while the off-white matte 6\\"x8.5\\" paper is lovely for the text, it does not allow high-quality reproduction of the photographs. Pure white semi-glossy paper in a larger format would have been better.<br />Buy this book from Amazon.com!	2004-01-13

They did not have digital techniques, but nevertheless produced wonderful art (as suggested by the original title of the exhibition, &quot;Modern Beauty: Czech Photographic Avant-Garde 1918-1948&quot;).  I had heard of Frantisek Drtikol, Jaromir Funke, and Josef Sudek, but I had never seen a good sampling of their images before reading this book.  New to me were artists such as Jindrich Heisler, Jaroslav Rossler, Karel Teige, and Eugen Wiskovsky. The authors must have carefully chosen the photographs published in the book from collections in Prague and elsewhere. Most of the photos are in black and white, but some are in color, and all are well reproduced.  The text is illuminating, with discussion of the relationship of the Czech photographers' work to that of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Alexander Rodchenko, Man Ray, and other contemporaries. The chapters on &quot;optical words,&quot; &quot;hidden sources&quot; (e.g., collages), and surrealism were the most interesting to me.  Toward the back of the book, the chronologies, biographies, bibliography, and index are useful for future reference.  I hope you purchase it!	2002-10-17
US	52793955	RJHP5A0ET0GZ2	1858941253	669099581	Futurism and Photography	Books	4	21	21	N	N	Extremely Stimulating and Worth Purchasing, But Not Flawless	I have probably read over a hundred books on artistic photography, and this is the most inspiring in terms of my personal development as a photographer.  Still, it has some imperfections.  Here are the pluses and minuses.<br />Pluses:  First, the book (which accompanied a 2001 exhibition at the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art in London) packs a lot of good information.  The core chapters include \\"The Image of Self,\\" \\"Photodynamism,\\" \\"Photo-Performance,\\" \\"The Twenties,\\" and \\"The Thirties.\\"  Toward the end of the book are biographies and a bibliography. The extensive coverage of Anton Giulio Bragaglia and Arturo Bragaglia was appropriate since the brothers were important in the history of photography.  I had never heard of Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni), but he was clearly a major talent.<br />Second, the book is striking in design.  The black-and-white photographs from 1909-1939 are beautifully reproduced.  Each chapter begins with jumbled typography (even more radical than the cover) that matches the overall modernity of Futurists.  Even the front and back covers and flaps of this signature-bound book are stylish.<br />Minuses:  First, although the author is well known as an expert on Futurism, his text is abstruse.  Consider this sentence on page 10: \\"By translating the infrasensorial and metaperceptive dimensions for the first time... photography seemed to penetrate the very mystery of life.\\"  I am not certain if the problem is the original text or the translation from the Italian.<br />Second, I felt there was too much emphasis on Fortunato Depero.  He was certainly an important Futurist figure, and his self-portraits seem to be precursors of works by photographers such as Cindy Sherman and Nikki S. Lee.  Nevertheless, I do not feel that the inclusion of 14 photographs/details by him (including self-portraits) and 18 other photographs OF him was a good use of space.  I would have liked to see more works by artists such as Maggiorino Gramaglia, Edmund Kesting,and Wanda Wulz, whose photos are more visually intriguing than Depero's.<br />Finally, although the author puts the Futurist photographers in the broader context of Italian Futurists such as Marinetti and Azari, the book would have been stronger if he had compared in more detail Futurist photographers with contemporaries such as Alvin Langdon Coburn, John Heartfield, Man Ray, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and Alexander Rodchenko.  Another set of comparisons could have involved \\"avant-garde\\" photographers who came before and after the Futurists.  Perhaps a couple pages of text and images could have been devoted to the relationships of non-Futurist and Futurist photographers.<br />All things taken into consideration, I have put this book in a prominent place in my library and will be referring to it frequently.

The verbatim replies and brief commentaries are arranged by respondent; a bibliography lists the respondents who cited each book.  A special page is devoted to &quot;The Americans&quot; by Robert Frank, and another special page to the 10 other top vote getters.  Some of the choices were idiosyncratic (e.g., some authors touted their own work which no one else mentioned), but overall this book is indispensable.  I especially liked the selection of books ABOUT photography (as opposed to BY photographers), such as  &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; by Barthes.  Although I would agree with the other reviewer below that books on non-artistic genres (e.g., news, sports, nature) are underrepresented, that's not an important issue for me.	2002-04-28

The &quot;questions&quot; of the title are (without the question marks): What is/are beauty, the universe, magic, trust, language, luck, happiness, pleasure, consciousness, the mystery of the Sphinx, dreams, memory, youth, old age, time, humor, grief, desire, love, music, God, life, death, nothing? and Who am I?. In the middle of these is a section on &quot;the seven ages of man.&quot;  Each concept is explored with black &amp; white photograph(s) and poetry.  For example, for &quot;grief&quot; there is a series of six photos showing a man reading a letter, looking at a picture, and then holding his head in his hands, and the sentence &quot;grief is the unconsolable melancholy of loss.&quot;  I do not feel that the photography is Michal's best, and the poetry sometimes borders on bathetic.  Nevertheless, I recommend this book as a strong example of one of the most original artists of our time.	2001-12-14

I did not feel that the book was &quot;tremendously useful,&quot; &quot;profound and practical,&quot; &quot;a brilliant job,&quot; &quot;thought-provoking,&quot; &quot;absolutely breakthrough,&quot; etc.  Inspired by the 2 June 2001 and 9 May 2000 reviews here, I compared the book side-by-side with &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot; (&quot;TFD&quot;) by Peter M. Senge.  TFD outshines &quot;The Path of Least Resistance for Managers&quot; in the following ways:  (1) &quot;Path&quot; presents basically a single idea about &quot;oscillations&quot; repeatedly; TFD contains numerous great ideas.  (2) TFD gives examples of companies that did (e.g., Royal Dutch/Shell) and did not (e.g., People Express) follow TFD's advice; it is not proven that the ideas in &quot;Path&quot; will actually improve a company.  (3) &quot;Path&quot; oversimplifies the complexities of companies, while TFD analyzes these complexities and suggests management techniques that address them.  In summary, don't waste your time and money on this two-star book, buy TFD instead.	2001-10-27

I found chapter 2 on graphic controls (e.g., lines, shapes, patterns) quite valuable and not covered in much detail in the other two books.  For example, the discussion of &quot;lines and their meanings&quot; on p.31 is thought-provoking.  The technical data (e.g., camera, lens, exposure, film, and darkroom techniques) on pp.137-141 were also useful.

For example, just changing time of day (pp.130-137) can make a big difference in the quality of light in a photo. (I disagree with the November 12, 1999, review here; many shots were improved by methods other than &quot;another lens.&quot;  I also disagree with the November 23, 2000, review, in that Peterson tells you exactly what is wrong with the &quot;bad&quot; photos.)

I am not as enthusiastic about the book as the 8/98-4/01 reviewers are.  There is a certain similarity to almost all of Patterson's photos, which tend to have &quot;muted colours&quot; and a &quot;very limited range of hues&quot; (p.151).  The vast majority could be characterized as &quot;nature&quot; or &quot;abstract nature&quot; photos; only a few include man-made structures (e.g., p.20) and only a few others have people with recognizable faces in them (e.g., p.76).  Another problem is that this book does not give photographic examples of what the author considers &quot;bad&quot; composition.  OTOH, the text is perhaps the best of the three books, concentrating not on technique but on fundamental principles of observing, imagining, and expressing.

I have  not seen multiple Polaroids showing the effects of changes in lighting (pp.  46-133) in any other book.  Freeman's &quot;...Studio Manual&quot; has only  a few pages devoted to lighting.  My only complaints about &quot;Lighting  Secrets...&quot; are: (A) The title should have the word  &quot;studio,&quot; since the book does not cover natural lighting.  (B)  Chapter Two (pp.17-43) on the &quot;Whys of Lighting&quot; shows only a  single lighting diagram and a single photo from each shoot.  (C) The images  on pages 109 and 125, manipulated using 1990 computer technology, are not  very attractive.  (D) The photo on p. 113 (identical to the cover) should  be swapped with the photos on p. 115.  (E) It would have been nice to know  the film, camera, and lens for each shoot.	2000-06-20

I went to the library and compared the &quot;NEW &amp; IMPROVED&quot; (as the red 8-pointed star on the cover  proclaims) 1999 edition with the old.  The new edition is a lot better.   First, some photos that did not have much impact for me (e.g., a shot of  adults kissing on Halloween) have been deleted.  Second, 18 pages of color  photos (some of which have the gaudy color combinations typical of the  1970s) and a number of B&amp;W photos were added.  Third, the order of  photos is more meaningful; for example, &quot;I believe in women's  liberation&quot; was the second photo in the old edition but is on page 21  in the new edition (opposite a depiction of two chairs and a TV).  Fourth,  Owen's editor Shimshak has added captions for photos that previously had  none (e.g., on pages 16-17).  Finally, there is a new introduction by  journalist David Halberstam.	2000-04-16

About the book &quot;cover[ing] too much material in too little detail,&quot; I  disagree.  All of the photographs have either a detailed verbal description  of how the lighting was set up, or a verbal description and a diagram.   About the book requiring a &quot;lot of gear and equipment,&quot; the back  cover says that the author &quot;begin[s] with an inventory of ingredients  found in a well-stocked commercial studio,&quot; which is fair warning for  the buyer.  With some imagination, as another reviewer wrote below, an  amateur photographer can make do with not-too-expensive equipment (e.g.,  for the first &quot;recipe&quot; on pages 24-26 the reflector can be a  shiny collapsible auto windshield sun reflector that costs $5 at Wal-Mart).   I liked Bidner's describing the different styles and lighting techniques  used by six professional photographers (Bean, Branman, Farkas, Lane, Thien,  Wegner).  I don't think I'll ever spend as much money or time (e.g., 10-11  hours photographing a small crystal sailboat, pages 117-119) on photos as  the six photographers, but nevertheless this book gave me some great ideas.	2000-04-13

The strength of this book is the outstanding collection of photos.  Although only 6 of 79 photos are in color, 50 are 3/4 to a full page in size  (allowing me to appreciate the details), and virtually all were beautiful  (except one on p.62 in which the bride looks too washed-out for my taste).   I found the lighting diagrams helpful (I counted only 24 of them, although  the back cover says &quot;over 50 lighting diagrams&quot;).  There's a good  index in the back.  On the other hand, some of Ferro's advice seems overly  prescriptive (e.g., &quot;...when shooting a ceremony... never [shoot] with  flash,&quot; &quot;we try to discourage couples from having a receiving  line&quot;).  The advice in Wedding Photographer's Handbook by Hurth and  Hurth (e.g., &quot;talk with the official&quot; about flash etc.,  &quot;photographically speaking, the receiving line is not... useful&quot;)  is more appropriate.	2000-04-02

The Hurth and Hurth book has over 100 photos of weddings, many of them classy, but I think the photos have two problems.  First, many are too small to  show important details.  Second, less than a third of the photos are in  color, and the color is not reproduced very vividly. On the other hand, I  liked the extensive text, especially the grey &quot;Shooter's Log&quot;s  with anecdotes about things that go wrong at weddings, and the grey  &quot;Reader's Note&quot;s in the sidebars with helpful hints.	2000-04-02

I agree with other reviews on this Web page about this overall excellent book, so I'll try not to repeat opinions in those reviews.  Unlike other books on  wedding photography I looked at, the example photos in Sint's book are  nearly all in color, which is nice.  The comparison of different types of  cameras (e.g., TLR, rangefinder, SLR) on pages 98-112 (e.g., regarding  interchangeability of film magazines and lenses, viewfinder and time  parallax, and noise) made me think hard about what equipment I'll need.  I  wish the book had an index (e.g., if you're trying to find info on filters,  you have to look under &quot;Lens Accessories&quot; in the table of  contents), but this is a small omission in an otherwise great book.	2000-04-02

The  advantages of this dictionary over the other two are: (1) some words and  phrases are in this book but not the other two (e.g., &quot;love bug,&quot;  &quot;love me, love my dog&quot;); (2) it gives specific quotations and  sources (e.g., &quot;Had Feldstein deliberately low-balled the original  numbers? - Newsweek&quot;); (3) it indicates what sort of people originated  or might use the word/phrase (e.g. &quot;lot louse... [used in the]  circus&quot;); and (4) thorough cross-references are integrated into the  body of the dictionary (e.g., &quot;love, see CALF LOVE, FOR THE LOVE OF  PETE, PUPPY LOVE&quot;).  It has 617 pages and claims to have 19,000  entries, which is between the other two books.  On the other hand, the  Cassell Dictionary contains a large percentage of the entries in this book  as well as many more entries, and it's the oldest of the three  dictionaries.  Still, if you had to buy only one of the three, this is  probably the one to get.	2000-02-27
