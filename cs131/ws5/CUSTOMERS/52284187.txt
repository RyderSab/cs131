The book is a quality follow-up to Lencioni's exceptional business novel \\"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team\\".  It focuses on conducting meetings with unfiltered conflict and a passionate debate of ideas. He contends that the same elements of conflict that engage us in a movie are the keys to an interesting and productive meeting.<br /><br />\\"Death by Meeting\\" is easy to read, entertaining, practical, and helpful.  I found the characters interesting and the story enjoyable.  If you lead an organization where meetings are seen as a necessary evil, you should invest in \\"Death by Meeting.\\"  A great resource for learning the model and implementing the book can be found at Lencioni's company website - [...]	2005-06-29

The book centers on five leadership concepts.<br /><br />1. Competence - Focus your time and energy in your areas of strength.<br /><br />2. Courage - The leader is the one willing to take the lead.<br /><br />3. Clarity - Be clear even if you are uncertain.<br /><br />4. Coaching - It takes a coach to bring out your full potential.<br /><br />5. Character - Character makes you a leader worth following and it provides you with moral authority.<br /><br />In Augustinian terms, Stanley has plundered the Egyptians, by borrowing many concepts from authors of business books and translating them into the vernacular of the minister and the world of the church.  He does this with numerous examples of characters in the Bible and from his own personal life and ministry.<br /><br />\\"The Next Generation Leader\\" is a short, interesting, and thoughtful book designed for those beginning their leadership journey.  It should also provide reminders and challenges to those who have served as leaders for some time.  I highly recommend the book for emerging Christian leaders.  If you are looking for a more comprehensive study of church leadership from a similar perspective I would recommend \\"Courageous Leadership\\" by Bill Hybels or \\"The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership\\" by John Maxwell.	2005-05-21

Through the use of an appealing story, Blanchard and Cathy challenge their readers to leave behind the capitalistic corporate model of materialism, that encourages greed and hording. Their recommended alternative is not a socialistic governmental model of regulation, redistribution and dependence, but the Biblical stewardship pathway of earning, giving and empowering. This encompasses more than treasure but includes time, talent, and touch. The authors refer to this as \\"The Generosity Factor\\" and they see it as the path to contentment, fulfillment and positive social change.<br /><br />For this work Blanchard seems to raise his writing skills as a novelist. His characters are still stereotypical and his ending idyllic (which he admits) but there is a better dialogue flow between the personalities. The values of \\"The Generosity Factor\\" so counters our current cultural flow that they can't be ignored and their promise of a greater way of life dare us to embrace them. This book is good for the soul. I'm planning to order a case of these books to give away to others!	2005-05-20

Through the life of the books characters you'll see these principles lived out.  Blanchard's found an ingenious formula for sharing keys to effective leadership, management and life.  It is a great method of getting the non-technical person to read a business book.  \\"The Secret\\" is another quality offering by Ken Blanchard.	2005-05-20

It depicts a journey from the pre-Willow (Son City) days continuing through the mega-church mid-1990's, to the movement known as the Willow Creek Association. It tells the story of people fervently pursuing their vision of God's dream for the church.<br /><br />The second half of the book, written by Senior Pastor Bill Hybels, uncovers the mission, philosophy and methods employed by the church.

Ellis portrays the first US President as a man of paradoxical greatness.  Washington is seen as passionate yet tremendously self-controlled, ambitious yet frequently reluctant, and aloof yet inwardly tender.  The author dispels much of the Washington mythology but confirms the reality of a man worthy of respect.<br /><br />\\"His Excellency\\" is filled with facts and hard evidence but Ellis' interpretations of events leads to much speculation as to Washington motives, purposes and convictions.  In so doing I felt the author downplayed the spiritual dimension of Washington's character, which was an important part of the American ethos, clearly expressed in the President's first inaugural address.<br /><br />One of the most inspiring aspects of the book was found in observing the maturing of Washington's character and worldview.  His changing perspective on the issue of slavery was just one example of this personal evolution.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to any discerning reader wanting greater insight into the life of one of America's most significant leaders.	2005-05-10

At the time I enjoyed the book more for its interesting stories than for its relationship principles.  Recently I listened to the audio book version and was extremely impressed by these proven methods of dealing with people.  It made me regret not applying more of what I read the first time around.<br /><br />Overall I find the book to provide a very good basis for dealing with people.  Since listening to the audio book, I have found myself in relational situations where I recall and apply one of Carnegie's principles.  Often they work with amazing results.  Here is list of some of Carnegie's simple but effective maxims.<br /><br />1. Don't criticize, condemn or complain.<br />2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.<br />3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.<br />4. Become genuinely interested in other people.<br />5. Smile.<br />6. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.<br />7. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.<br />8. Talk in terms of the other person's interests.<br />9. Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.<br /><br />Having read other books on human relations, I still believe \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" (first published while Herbert Hoover was in the Whitehouse) is the best.  The audio book version has received some updating.  In the midst of stories from a different era, an example from the life of Stevie Wonder is thrown into the mix.  Regardless of what time the stories come from, the principles of How to Win Friends and Influence People are still as valuable and applicable today as they were the day the book was originally released.	2005-05-07

As such his book \\"The Holy Spirit in the Third Millennium\\" was of great interest to me.<br /><br />The book is not primarily a study of the person and the work of the Holy Spirit.  Rather the focus is on the subjects of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and glossalia (speaking in other tongues).  Linzey argues that the Baptism of the Holy Spirit occurs at salvation and it is not an event subsequent to salvation.  He sees the gift of tongues as a manifestation any believer can release by faith.<br /><br />I found the greatest value of the book was in his explanation of how he leads people into an experience of \\"manifesting the Spirit\\" (speaking in tongues).  Regardless of your understanding of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, Linzey gives some valuable practical direction for Pentecostals and Charismatics desiring to lead people into receiving or \\"manifesting\\" the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />Though I do not agree with his understanding of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, I did find his explanation interesting.  The book was easy to read and Linzey's insights are worth considering.	2005-01-30

The experience was powerful for our congregation and the book aided in challenging our church members to spiritual cleansing and consecration.  Frizzell has written the book primarily to be used for church-wide times of seeking God but it would also be beneficial to individuals.<br /><br />\\"Returning to Holiness\\" is a hard hitting and convicting work that strongly calls believers to a life of personal holiness and consecration.  It covers every area of sin and impurity imaginable.  For the mature and grounded Christian it is a clarion call to a God-honoring life-style.  I'd caution those who are subject to self-condemnation and spiritual insecurity that this book needs to be read with heavy doses of encouragement and grace.  We are all a work in progress.  For the individual I'd give it four stars but as a devotional during a congregational Sacred Assembly, I know of no better resource. As such I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Church leaders will find helpful instructions on conducting a special time of church-wide spiritual emphasis.  I'd recommend a pastor carefully read through the book before taking a congregation through it.  If you are planning to buy an individual copy AMAZON.COM is a good place to order from.  Should you plan to buy copies to distribute to a large group of people, I'd recommend contacting Dr. Frizzell's office directly.  They are able to provide the books in bulk at an exceptional price.	2004-12-30

His seven steps are a plan for carrying out a meaningful time of fasting and prayer.

As he predicted, the wave has hit and has left many casualties in its wake.  The church body count continues to rise, while wise leaders who prepared for it are thriving.<br />The book serves as an introduction to ministry in a Post Modern culture.  At times he seems to be an apologist for Post Modernity.  You probably won't always agree with the writer but he will give you a look into the mind of the culture.  His presentation of the current ministry realities makes this a significant book and certainly worth the read.<br />Sweet is a chaotic, quirky, witty, and sometimes annoying writer.

In \\"Rediscovering Pastoral Ministry\\" you will find a condensed version of the pastoral theology curriculum of Master's Seminary.  The book looks at the role of the pastor, the qualifications of a pastor, the personal and public sides of the pastors life, and the major areas of church ministry.  While the Bible seems to provide principles and guidelines in which individual churches are allowed to express their unique ministries, I found MacArthur and his team to be very opinionated and dogmatic about the way church should be done.  Many of his methods and concepts would be both impractical and ineffective for the majority of the church world.  The Bible sets the bar high when it comes to qualifying for the pastoral office.  I found MacArthur sets the qualifications even higher than that which Scripture requires.  Portions of the book provide valuable teaching for all evangelical pastors and churches.  The author's high view of Scripture and Biblical authority is refreshing.  Despite my cautions about the book, it is a valuable contribution to pastoral literature.  If your views are the same as MacArthur or you're willing to wade through his dogma on disputable issues, you'll be enriched by the book.	2003-07-08

Based on Luke 5:37-39, Snyder sees the wine as the message of the gospel, which is essential and primary.  He sees the wine skins as the way in which the church touches the culture with the gospel, which is secondary though necessary and useful.  The problem comes when we take the ever-new gospel and try to contain it within the old wineskins of \\"outmoded traditions, obsolete philosophies, creaking institutions, and old habits.\\"  When we do, the powerful and life-changing gospel is constricted and must burst free.  Snyder believes it is time for the church to update her wineskins.  To remedy the problem, Dr. Snyder recommends a cataclysm that explodes the current church structures and creates new wineskins.<br />Some of the concepts investigated by \\"Radical Renewal\\" include the significance of ministry to the poor, the de-emphasizing of church buildings, the dynamic of Christian community, a Biblical church model, and small groups as the church's basic unit.  His chapter devoted to \\"The Gospel to the Poor\\" was my favorite and was the most compelling portion of the book.  Some of his concepts are presented in a radical and even an absurd way and then they are brought back to a practical and applicable balance.  Other \\"radical\\" concepts (such as the acknowledging and releasing of spiritual gifts) have become accepted practice in many churches since the original release of the work.  The year of its release, \\"Radical Renewal\\" would have been ahead of its time.  It still contains insights and concepts that are of significant value to today's church.	2003-01-25

There is a brief introduction and history of the subject, followed by a practical guide to historical-cultural-contextual, lexical-syntactical, theological, and literary analysis.  Finally, there is a section on how to apply the text after it is interpreted. You can practice your hermeneutical skills using \\"BT's\\" (Brain Teasers) that are included at the end of each chapter.  The book includes a helpful and concise outline of all the most important principles taught.  I highly recommend this much needed resource.	2002-07-10

When I first read the book in 1991, it had a positive influence on me and on the direction of my church.  Looking back through the book I realize that I would have been more effective in my past decade of ministry if I had regularly used Logan's book as my reference guide.  Beyond Church Growth contains ten key principles: The value of faith and prayer, becoming an effective pastoral leader, developing a culturally relevant philosophy of ministry, holistic disciple making, expanding a network of cell groups, developing and equipping leaders, mobilizing believer's according to spiritual gifts, appropriate and productive programming, and starting churches that reproduce.  Some of the trends and current realities have changed but Beyond Church Growth is still an excellent resource for church leaders desiring to build prevailing churches.	2002-05-24

This book is a condensed practical, pragmatic, and easy-to-follow church management guide. I first read the book in 1989 but recently reviewed it again and was reminded of its valuable suggestions, ideas, and principles.  \\"Leading and Managing Your Church\\" would be an exceptional book for those lacking quality training or effective habits in practical self-organization and church administration.  It also serves as a good reminder and encourager for efficient church veterans desiring to enhance or expand their skills.<br />The self-descriptive chapter titles include: Leadership and Church Growth, Using Spiritual Gifts to Focus Ministry, Managing Time More Effectively, Goal Setting and Project Planning, Skills for Effective Ministry Management, Building a Leadership Team, Developing People Through Delegation, Using the Pastor's Planning Workbooks, Obtaining Goal Ownership, The Berry-Bucket Theory (George's theory on pastor/member control), and Faith Can Be Learned.  The 192-page book includes an appendix filled with examples of management worksheets, charts, forms and tools for the teachable and enthusiastic church leader. Many of these items are now more easily designed and utilized with common computer technology.	2002-05-15

Greek Study Tools	\\"Do It Yourself Hebrew and Greek\\" is just what the name implies.  This is a \\"do it yourself\\" course on original Biblical languages.  In the book, Goodrick has done a quality job of explaining basic Greek grammar in summary form.  The book includes many common sense rules and guidelines for the interpretation of Scripture.  You'll find the majority of the book is devoted to teaching the student how to use language tools (concordances, commentaries, analyticals, lexicons, and interlinears) and how to conduct word studies.  The text includes twenty lessons, self-graded worksheets, and answer keys that are quite helpful.  There are many warnings along the way regarding the limitations to this \\"low road\\" method of studying the original languages.  Goodrick has provided a practical and helpful guide for those desiring to better understand the Bible's message in its original tongue without the necessity of making the enormous investment necessary to become proficient in the languages.	2002-03-09

As a former Dallas Seminary professor, Deere is uniquely qualified to argue his cause with a thorough knowledge of, and sincere empathy for, the cessationist view.  I particularly appreciated his adept handling of B.B. Warfield's cessationist arguments.  Deere also brings Scriptural insight and Biblical balance to Pentecostal and Charismatic views.  His blend of confessional storytelling, along with sound theology, is a wonderful mix resulting in a great literary contribution.	2002-03-03

Bounds' primary target is the minister of the Gospel.  His aim is sure and his words will certainly penetrate any sincere but prayerless preacher's heart.  E.M. Bounds was a tireless man of prayer, whose words ring with authenticity, passion, and conviction.  I have the entire series of Bounds' eight short books on the subject of prayer. \\"Power Through Prayer\\" is by far my favorite and a book I regularly go back to when my own prayer life is losing its fire.  For a dose of prayer motivation, inspiration, and passion there is no better book than this classic 128-page work, \\"Power Through Prayer.\\"	2002-03-01

The primary areas the tapes cover include empowering people effectively, running meetings efficiently, and delegating projects productively. In listening to the tapes I realized deficiencies in my own management skills and was given practical ways to improve. Unlike some audio books narrators, Michael Podolinsky does an outstanding job of keeping the material interesting and of keeping your mind engaged in what he's discussing. The program also comes complete with a handy pocket guide. If you're looking for stimulation and information to improve your management skills I recommend \\"Smart Leadership.\\"	2002-02-20

Erickson is obviously well studied in a vast array of theological issues from various schools of thought.  Typically he will present common viewpoints on a subject and then make an argument for his own position.  Most of Erickson's positions seem clearly Calvinistic, but he treats other views with fairness, appreciation, and respect.  Though I come from a dissimilar denominational background and some of my personal views are very different than his, I never felt my beliefs were under an unfair scrutiny or malicious attack.  The book was so engaging and interesting that I actually found it hard to put down.  I highly recommend the book to anyone desiring to study Christian theology at a seminary level.	2002-02-15

Nehemiah's vision for rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem is used as a classic example of the things God wants to accomplish in the lives of everyday Godly dreamers. The subject of vision is masterfully defined while practical<br />steps for vision formulation and achievement are carefully explained and clearly illustrated. The book makes for enjoyable, inspiring, and empowering reading. Visionaries waiting for the fulfillment of their dreams can draw good counsel and encouragement from this book. I highly recommend &quot;Visioneering&quot; to anyone who dares to dream.  I would also encourage the serious Christian visionary to read &quot;The Power of Vision&quot; by George Barna. The two works bring balance, clarity, and fullness to each other.	2002-02-07

In some cases the criticism is well deserved because of public invitations that attempt to manipulate spiritual seekers.  As such, many evangelists have retreated from calling people to a public commitment to Christ.  \\"The Effective Invitation\\" by Dr. R. Alan Streett provides a powerful apologetic and a practical guide for a return to the public invitation.  In this 252-page volume, the gospel message is clearly outlined, and an outstanding explanation of repentance and saving faith is provided.<br /><br />The author presents the Biblical and historic precedents for the public invitation, followed by a fascinating chapter chronicling Billy Graham's use of the invitation. Streett answers the critics and presents the pertinent reasons for extending an evangelistic call. Finally, he examines the \\"how to's\\" of preparing and delivering an authentic and effective public invitation. This includes an assessment of the various models used to invite people to make a decision. The book concludes with sections on the use of music (somewhat dated) during the invitation and insights into the particular sensitivities required when inviting children to Christ.<br /><br />\\"The Effective Invitation\\" is concise, persuasive, and practical. I'm aware of no better book on the subject. I highly recommend it to any pastor or evangelist who desires to see people come to Christ through the public invitation.	2002-01-30

He challenges Christians to refocus their attention to evangelizing their world, committing themselves to God's Word, loving others, praying with power and worshiping in spirit and in truth.<br />Laurie's writing style is humble, down to earth, well illustrated, relevant, and enjoyable. The testimony of his personal ministry calling and the launching of Harvest Church are interesting and God honoring. This isn't a book of techniques or methods but rather a back-to-the-basics model of Biblical mandates and challenges presented by one of the most effective evangelists and pastors of our generation.	2001-12-19

As such, the book is co-authored by an academician and a pastor. Its purpose is to give practical help to the local church pastor who has the responsibility of preaching weekly. It is designed to champion an expository approach to preaching while being sensitive to the nuances of weekly pastoral preaching. The goal of the authors is to close the gap between classroom theory and what actually works in a pastor's weekly preparation.<br /><br />The book is divided into the three parts, those being preparation, process, and presentation of exposition. \\"Power in the Pulpit\\" is a comprehensive, thorough, and exhaustive study of the art and science of expository preaching. Theological and philosophical foundations are examined, detailed descriptions of the process are explored, and practical suggestions for implementation are encouraged. The book is written in language a novice can understand with principles that the seasoned preaching veteran will find helpful. At the time of this writing, if I could recommend only one volume on expository preaching, this would be it.	2001-12-19

He emphasizes that when comparing world religions one must base his conclusions on truth, not on prevailing moods. Zacharias examines how Jesus handled some of life's critical questions compared to the answers offered by the world religions (primarily Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam). Essentially he compares Christianity to other belief systems and concludes that there is no comparison.  Despite popular sentiment to the contrary, all religions are not basically the same.  Faith in Christ is the only one that stands the test.<br />Though Zacharias' personal testimony is fascinating and his philosophical, theological, and historical arguments are persuasive, the book did not meet my expectations.  I was expecting a more thorough evaluation of Christianity compared to world religions.  Instead I found a fair apologetic with only cursory analysis of and comparisons with other belief systems (including atheistic humanism).  \\"Jesus Among Other Gods\\" is neither a complete apologetic nor a thorough study of comparative religion.  It is, however, an interesting and enlightening study from a thoughtful and knowledgeable author that is well worth investing in.	2001-12-14

The volume is designed to be a condensed version of the seminary's expository preaching program.  It is divided into five parts and nineteen chapters.  The first section is essentially an apologetic for the necessity of expository preaching.  Section two deals with the preacher as a man of God, a man of prayer and a man of the Word.  The third section covers hermeneutics, exegesis, grammatical analysis, study tools, and study methods.  Section four examines the preparation of the expository message.  The final section looks at effectively delivering the message.<br /><br />\\"Rediscovering Expository Preaching\\" is well written, thorough, challenging, inspiring, and instructional.  Only those students proficient in Biblical languages would be capable of fully utilizing the book's instructions; Yet, any Christian hoping to improve his ability at interpreting and expounding Scriptural truth could benefit from this work.  The authors guide you through the entire process of preparation to presentation of expository messages.  Along the way you are given principles, guidelines, suggestions, motivations, and examples.  You derive from this writing the highest regard for God's Word and a great sense of responsibility to proclaim it authentically, accurately and boldly.  The authors present the material authoritatively, even on disputable matters.  It isn't the first book I'd recommend on the subject of preaching but it is an outstanding presentation of the discipline and art of expository preaching.	2001-12-03

First, \\"The Walk to Pursue\\" concerns the preacher's life, emphasizing that God is more concerned with what we are than what we do.  He investigates the preacher's relationship to God's Word, his need for the spirit-filled life, and the requirements of being a man of God.  He also investigates the preacher's work in the context of the pastoral ministry.  Second, \\"The Work to Perform\\" examines the method of preaching.  Here you learn the \\"how to's\\" of expository preaching.  I found this the most helpful and the strongest segment of the book.  Clear instruction is given on the methodology of preparing an expository message from beginning to end.  Third, \\"The Word to Proclaim\\" looks at the message that is to be proclaimed.  Emphasis is placed on the preacher's need for God's anointing to carry out his calling.  You will also learn how to apply the sermon to your audience, how to effectively present an invitation, and methods of conserving the evangelistic harvest.<br />The greatest value of the book is as an encyclopedia of information detailing the process of expository sermon composition and delivery.  The authors' passion for the subject is clearly sensed and the organization of the text makes it a quality resource manual.  Portions of the book read much like a sermon.  Perusal of this work provides a lesson on effective alliteration.  It does have somewhat of an \\"old time\\" feel to it, as if you are reading something written in another generation.  The 396-page book includes an appendix and extensive endnotes. \\"Anointed Expository Preaching\\" is a valuable resource for anyone desiring to improve his understanding of expository preaching and skill as an expository preacher.old time\\" feel to it, as if you are reading something written in another generation.

The book is a partisan overview of the key events and most significant personalities that contributed to this century-long religious phenomenon.  Synan provides outstanding coverage of the enormous contributions of African Americans, and Hispanics, as well as females within the movement.  Among other subjects, many pages are devoted to Pentecostalism's holiness roots, charismatic renewal among both Roman Catholics and the mainline Protestant denominations, along with a chapter devoted to faith healers and televangelists.<br />The book does contain weaknesses. Despite Gary McGee's excellent chapter on global expansion, Synan fails to include a full global prospective, which is actually the most impressive aspect of Pentecostalism.  Though I appreciate much of the work of David Barrett in the final chapter, I found his statistical evaluation too inclusive and some of his futuristic predictions a bit bizarre.<br />This 492-page hardcover work contains an abundance of photographs, vignettes, and a colorful pullout timeline of key events.  In addition to Synan, there are nine exceptional guest authors who contribute to the book.  This is a well-done presentation that should be on the shelf of every enthusiast of Pentecostal and Charismatic history.	2001-11-16

Through extensive research and superior storytelling, he demonstrates how these religious pioneers brought together the clashing impulses of the \\"primitive\\" and the \\"pragmatic\\" to \\"capture lightening in a bottle\\" and launch an explosive movement.  Potential readers need to be warned in advance that the author is a social historian and academician. If you are looking for stories of romanticized heroes of the faith or glowing partisan historiography, you'll be disappointed. What you will get is a consistently fair, sometimes surprising, and always interesting account of the early Pentecostals.<br />In the book's fifteen chapters we get a glimpse into the character, temperament, and daily lives of these adventurous and hearty souls.  You'll discover the keys to their effectiveness and the areas where they stumbled.  Included among many subjects covered are the movement's leaders, the theology and practicality behind the prominence of women, their changing views on war, the persecutions they faced, and even the \\"gift of tongues\\" that helped make their faith distinctive.  The stereotype of the poor, illiterate, and disinherited Pentecostals is dismantled.  Instead you will meet a representative slice of early 20th century America.  They were a people genuinely sincere, deeply committed to their beliefs, and fully convinced that they were instruments in the hands of Almighty God, empowered by the Holy Spirit for the purpose of fulfilling the Great Commission of Jesus Christ.<br />\\"Heaven Below\\" is made up of 269 pages of fascinating reading, followed by an appendix, and 82 pages of footnotes.  It also includes a valuable index.  I had some difference of opinion with Wacker's conclusions and occasional qualms with his assumptions, but as a social history, I highly recommend \\"Heaven Below.\\" Grant Wacker is Associate Professor of the History of Religion in America, Duke University.ofessor of the History of Religion in America, Duke University.	2001-11-14

To my surprise, information about Azusa was not the focus of the book.  It could have better been titled \\"The Adventures, Trials, and Opinions of Frank Bartleman.\\"  The book is essentially a journal of Bartleman's experiences in the early Pentecostal movement from 1904 to 1910, inclusive of his involvement in the Azusa Street Mission. Vinson Synan's introduction is informative and helpful in setting a framework for the rest of the book.<br />The book is an opportunity to view the life and mindset of this early 20th Century Pentecostal preacher.  His life was not easy but it was greatly dependent upon God.  Bartleman is a fascinating character.  He is extremely opinionated, often critical and fanatical in his stands. At the same time his passion for the ministry, his simple yet unwavering faith, and his deep hunger for God are inspiring.  I was moved by the sacrifice paid by this forerunner and challenged by his teaching on \\"death to the self-life.\\"  I recommend \\"Azusa Street\\" to those desiring a look inside early Pentecostalism.	2001-10-22

The 560-page volume gives the reader an overview of the people, events, movements, doctrines, and cultures that sometimes shaped the church and that the church often shaped.  The author shares little known details (Charlemagne was 7 foot tall), while presenting the broad-brush stroke of two thousand years of history.<br />The book was written from a conservative, nondenominational perspective.  Though the author is from the Reformed tradition, I thought the book was thoughtful, fair, and balanced.  It is easy to read and contains an abundance of pictures, photographs, maps and charts.  Christianity Through the Centuries is an outstanding introductory presentation of Church history that I would heartily recommend.<br />Earle E.

The first part involved a homogenous group and had divine healing as its primary emphasis. The second phase had a diverse cultural mix and included a greater emphasis on a variety of spiritual gifts. David Harrell writes as a researcher or journalist who tells the story of the events and people as an outsider.<br />Almost all of the major personalities of the time are examined.  Harrell focuses on the \\"two giants,\\" William Branham and Oral Roberts.  You will also learn about people like Jack Coe, A. A. Allen, Gordon Lindsay, T. L. Osborn, Kathryn Kuhlman and many others.  If someone is looking for an inspiring devotional book or a glowing biography, they may be disappointed. You will read about the good, the bad, the spectacular, and the ridiculous.  Many reported testimonies appear exaggerated or fabricated. Yet, when you examine the avalanche of evidence it is hard to doubt the authenticity of miraculous happenings.  Many of these leaders were capable and gifted individuals, yet the book clearly testifies to the fact that God uses \\"earthen vessels\\" and \\"the foolish things to confound the wise.\\"<br />For Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians of the era it will bring back memories.  Modern day members of the movement can learn valuable lessons, be warned about excesses and abuses, but also be stirred in their faith.  The curious outsider can gain knowledge about a fascinating slice of American history.  The 304-page book includes a section of photographs, a helpful index, an extensive bibliography, and reference notes.

He makes you take a long hard look at your own leadership. Miller has not written a \\"how to\\" manual for \\"would be\\" leaders but he has written words to awaken the leadership potential of those already called to lead.  The author tells us, \\"Whatever leadership is, it is not a hankering after success.  Leadership lies in a hunger to understand and make the world a better place.\\"<br />King David is the example.  Thought his life you will learn ten valuable keys to the life of a servant leader, which include: fostering an honest servant image; learning the art of self-perception; networking; vision; decision making; defining, structuring, and motivating; the politics of grace and the abuse of power; and coping with difficult people.

It all began on January 1 of 1901 with one young woman in Topeka, Kansas, who began \\"speaking in tongues\\" and claiming her experience was evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. One hundred years later 500 million Pentecostal and Charismatic believers span the globe.  The Topeka Outpouring, shares valuable documentation that tells the story of the movements beginnings.<br />Martin gives us a brief biographical sketch of the controversial and notorious father of Pentecostalism, Charles Parham.  Then numerous first hand accounts are given by members of the Bethel Healing School, where the revival was birthed.  They include reports from Charles Parham, Sarah Parham, Lillian Thislethwaite, along with several from Agnes Ozman (the first to receive the experience).  Accounts of other observers are provided, as well as antagonists of the Pentecostal experience.  Finally, Martin includes several newspaper articles reporting on these early 20th century events.<br />For the curious inquirer or for the serious student of Pentecostal history, The Topeka Outpouring is a gold mine of information.  Many of the accounts are redundant and some of the material is of limited significance but the book is an important collection of original documentation relating to the origins of the Pentecostal branch of Christianity.	2001-09-12

It is for anyone looking for literature that opens a window into the Post-Apostolic Early Church.  The epistles included are The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians; The Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, Smyrnaeans, and to Polycarp; The Epistles of Polycarp to the Philippians; along with the Epistles to Diognetus and Barnabas.  The book also includes the Didache and the martyrdom of Polycarp.  For some reason Louth did not include the Shepherd of Hermas and the fragments of Papias, though he does mention them as being part of Cotelier's collection of writings by the Church Fathers.<br />If you are interested in the writings of the Church Fathers, and have never read such a collection, you can have some enjoyable and moving reading ahead of you.  In reference to his pending martyrdom Ignatius writes, \\"I am His (God's) wheat, ground fine by the lions' teeth to be made purest bread for Christ\\" (Romans 4).  He also says, \\"To die in Jesus Christ is better than to be monarch of earth's widest bounds.  He who dies for us is all I seek; He who rose again for us is my whole desire\\" (Romans 6). The Epistle to Diognetus contains a vivid and compelling description of the early Christians. The second half of the Didache is full of interesting guidelines and instructions to the early believers on such things as baptism and fasting.  Louth includes some good commentary about the fascinating account of the martyrdom of Polycarp.<br />The translation by Staniforth is very readable.  The introductions by Louth are interesting, helpful, and well written.  The notes following each book provide the author's commentary of the passage, assistance on difficult passages, insight into the mindset of the writer, important historical information, and other resources for further study.  These early church writings are available on the Internet but I have not found any Internet sources that provide as good a presentation of the writings as Early Christian Writings.  The inclusion of The Shepherd of Hermas and the fragments of Papias would have made it a more comprehensive collection.

This is because the greatest contribution of the Irish came in what Cahill calls the hinges or transitions of history.  According to the author the Irish Celts and Catholics made a contribution that European civilization depended on.  The book is a brief study of Europe's transition from the Roman to the medieval age, and the role of the Irish in this hinge point.  His thesis contends that without the monks and scribes of Ireland, this critical transition would have been impossible.  Cahill convincingly demonstrates, through fascinating historical narrative, that the Irish contribution has significantly shaped the history of the world.<br /><br />The author begins with the fall of the Roman Empire and its ramifications.  He then goes back to investigate the early history of Ireland through the transforming work of St. Patrick.  Next, he looks at the Irish priests, monks, scribes, and missionaries who build on the foundation of Patrick to lay their own foundation for future generations.  Finally, he shows how these holy men and women's contributions provided the avenue for western civilization to develop.  Cahill concludes by giving the reader his own interpretation of lessons to be learned for the day in which we find ourselves.  Along the way, we meet many interesting characters, hear numerous tales of various sorts, and gain insight into western history and western civilization.<br /><br />Thomas Cahill has contributed a valuable link to the world of St. Patrick and the Irish.  He writes with an intriguing, exciting, and captivating style.  The reader must leave behind any notions of history being boring.  Often he slips into the historical event being reported in order to demonstrate through his characters what it would have been like to be a part of the event.  Midway through the book, I was tempted to begin reading with an Irish accent!  I had never read a book that tackled this particular subject and few that approach history in such a playful way.  A general knowledge of history and western civilization would be helpful, but the book is designed to appeal to a wide audience. The sexual references and imagery could be offensive to some reader sensibilities.<br /><br />I can't help but notice all of the negative critiques of the book. I'm sure the work has its flaws but I thoroughly enjoyed it.d a book that tackled this particular subject and few that approach history in such a playful way.

On January 5, of 2001 he was the recipient of a lifetime Award for Scholarly Distinction from the American Historical Association.  The citation begins, \\"Ramsay MacMullen is the greatest historian of the Roman Empire alive today.\\" Obviously the author is eminently qualified for his research for this work.<br /><br /> Christianity grew dramatically from the day of Pentecost to the year 400 through mass conversations. At the end of the first century, the church held a minimal significance in Roman society.  It simply \\"did not count.\\"  Within three centuries it included ten percent of the population and had displaced the other religions of the empire.  In Christianizing the Roman Empire MacMullen addresses the factors for this amazing growth.  The author demonstrates that these mass conversions first came through the power of miracles and later through the social advantage of becoming a Christian.  As such, MacMullen is diminishing the value of Christian piety and the testimony of martyrs as reasons for the mass evangelization.<br /><br /> The book is divided into two sections, which are the times prior to 312 and after 312 (Constantine's \\"conversion\\" in 312 and the Edict of Milan in 313).  He first examines what Pagans of the culture believed.  Then he looks at what Christians presented to the Pagans about this new faith, and how they presented it.  The influence of Constantine is examined, as are the non-religious factors that led to conversions.  MacMullen then looks at evangelical campaigns after 312, including the conversion of intellectuals.  Finally he looks at the quality of the conversions and those that were won through coercion.<br /><br />I found MacMullen's research and use of sources of the highest quality.  The book contains forty-three pages of endnotes and commentary by the author about the endnotes.  In addition, the biography is extensive and would be of great value for those desiring to do additional research on the subject.  He uses many sources to verify his thesis that Christian miracles during the early years and favored advantage in the former years, rather than Christian love, piety, and courage in martyrdom, resulted in the dramatic growth of the church. MacMullen's research confirmed that Christianity becoming the Roman State religion strongly diluted the spiritual nature of the church.<br /><br />Christianizing the Roman Empire is an outstanding work of research by an eminently qualified authority.  I found the material fascinating.  Some of it attacked my pre-conceived notions, while other aspects of the book confirmed my reasoned suspicions.  The book is written for those who already have some knowledge and study in church history during this era in Rome.  Though MacMullen obviously is writing this book to an educated audience, the writing style is not nearly as high quality as his research.  The first two chapters may cause some sincere readers to give up on the book before they have an opportunity to enjoy its valuable contribution.  Despite its shortcomings, I would highly recommend Christianizing the Roman Empire to those with a high interest in learning more about this period of Roman and church history.and would be of great value for those desiring to do additional research on the subject.

The author selects twelve defining moments in church history and uses them as entry points into the sweeping and potentially overwhelming events of the two-thousand-year history of the Christian Church.  He hopes this method will bring order into a massively complicated subject, provide an opportunity to highlight moments that constitute the actual history of the church, and provide an opportunity to interpret why certain events may have marked an important fork in the road for the outworking of Christian history.<br />Turning Points was written for lay people and introductory students rather than for scholars.  The style of writing is interesting, easy to read, and to the point.  As such, it makes a great book for his audience. Though Noll is a Protestant evangelical, he is careful to avoid bias as he attempts to present Christianity as a worldwide religion.  The book is a survey of church history but the thesis revolves around the importance of twelve defining moments within the two-thousand-year span.  His selection of \\"turning points\\" include the Fall of Jerusalem (70), the Council of Nicaea (325), Benedict's monasticism (530), the coronation of Charlemagne (800), the schism of East and West (1054), the Reformation (1521), the English Reformation (1534), the founding of the Jesuits (1540), the conversion of the Wesleys (1738), the French Revolution (1789) and the Edinburgh Missionary Conference (1910).  The book is chronologically arranged around each of these events.  Conspicuously and intentionally Noll leaves off major events of the twentieth century, to be evaluated for significance from the preferred perspective of future generations. The author believes that book will have been successful if it \\"inspires others to think about why the turning points found here are not as important as other possibilities.\\"  There are many other possibilities that come to mind but Noll's list of most significant turning points is hard to dispute.  Each chapter begins with a hymn and ends with a prayer from the era being addressed.  This add an interesting flavor that sets the tone for the history Noll unfolds and then leaves you with a glimpse into the spiritual life of a contemporary to the event being studied.<br /> There are obvious pros and cons to this style of writing history.  When you are through reading \\"Turning Points\\" you feel like you've moved through the most significance events in the history of the church and some of the most momentous in human history.  Such a whirlwind journey gives you a good feel for the chronology and sequence of each defining event.  Because of Noll's ability to keep you moving along the plot line of the stories, the trip through history is an enjoyable journey.  Along the way Noll shares interesting commentary from history itself.  His historical exposition agrees with other church history work but without personal judgment or clearly biased commentary.  He uses reliable evidence to demonstrate his observations, without stretching it to accomplish his agenda or prove his point.<br />Examining two thousand years of Church history by investigating the twelve most significant turning points in that history is a valuable method of covering such a large body of information in a condensed form.  I highly recommend Turning Points as a thoughtful, engaging, and inspiring treatment of church history.  The reader should realize the book is not meant to be comprehensive or by any means an exhaustive treatment of the subject.  The book will give the novice a good overview of the history of Christianity and should provoke the curious student to further study.ortant as other possibilities.\\"  There are many other possibilities that come to mind but Noll's list of most significant turning points is hard to dispute.

This is the fourth edition and includes the latest scholarship in the field of Christian history.  The book is the major text for many seminary and university courses on the subject and with good reason, it includes quality research and scholarship. If you are a serious student of the subject you will enjoy the book and find it helpful in your own research.  If you are a novice or casual inquirer, I recommend you look elsewhere. It does not offer a smooth flow through history like other texts of this nature. On the spectrum of Christian scholarship, the text is on the liberal end.  The reading is more difficult than most introductory texts.  Also, the book does not seem to give equal print to subjects of equal value to the history of the world wide Church. Yet, for the serious student of church history, it is an outstanding resource.	2001-08-03

The SPC Model is described as a brief, structured counseling approach that is explicitly Christian and that appropriates the insights of contemporary counseling theory without sacrificing the resources of pastoral ministry.  It is designed to meet the needs of pastors for a counseling model.  The book examines the subject of pastoral counseling and then introduces the SPC Model.  Finally there is a case study that depicts how the model works.  All that the pastor is able to accomplish in the five-session case study seems exaggerated but the case study is effective at portraying SPC in action.  I would recommend this book to pastors looking for a realistic counseling model for church ministry or desire input for improving their current model or creating a new model.  Below I have briefly outlined the SPC model.<br />There are six characteristics of Strategic Pastoral Counseling (SPC).  1. It is brief and time-limited, working within a suggested maximum of five sessions.  Both the pastor and the parishioner are forced to work continuously at maintaining focus and direction.  To accomplish this objective the counselor must be active and directive.  The counseling relationship must be a partnership and concentrate on one central and specific problem.  Also the time limitation must be maintained.  2. The use of written materials is at the heart of SPC.  The Bible as well as a variety of other devotional, inspirational, and practical books are assigned to the client.  The literature should be integrated within the counseling session, not simply offered as a supplement to them.  The books must be compatible with the pastor's counseling philosophy and integral to the work with the parishioner.  It should serve as a support and extension of the counseling. 3. Short-term counseling should be wholistic.  It must be responsive to the behavioral (action), cognitive (thought), and affective (feeling) elements of personal functioning. 4. Fourth, short-term counseling is generally more structured.  Each of the sessions has a clear focus and each builds upon the previous ones in contributing to the accomplishment of the overall goals.  The structure is responsive to the tasks of conducting an initial assessment, developing a general understanding of the problem and of the person's major needs, and selecting and delivering interventions and resources that will bring help.  5. SPC is spiritually focused.  The Counselor listens to and enters into the experience of the parishioner as the parishioner relates his or her struggles and hear the story of the persons spiritual response to the experience.  6. SPC is Explicitly Christian.  It begins with a focus on spiritual matters understood broadly, but its master goal is to facilitate the person's awareness of and response to the call of God to surrender and service.  Ultimate wholeness cannot be found apart from a restored relationship with God through Jesus Christ. SPC utilizes Christian theological language, images, and concepts and the religious resources of prayer, Scripture, and the sacraments.  It also encourages reliance on the Holy Spirit.  Recognizing that all healing and growth are ultimately of God, the pastor can relax in the work of pastoral counseling.  The ultimate responsibility for the person lies with God.<br />Strategic Pastoral Counseling involves three stages.  1. The encounter stage, where boundaries are set, the central concerns and history are explored, a pastoral diagnosis is conducted, and a mutually agreeable focus is achieved. 2. The engagement stage, where the problem is explored wholistically and resources are identified for coping or change.  3. The disengagement stage, where progress is evaluated, concerns are accessed, referrals are arranged, and counseling is terminated.feeling) elements of personal functioning. 4.

The authors explain that all counseling operates from either a Christian or an alternative spiritual worldview.  The belief that it is possible to treat persons psychologically in a values-neutral manner is a myth.  No therapist is values neutral.  Values are the very lifeblood of all counselors do with their clients.  Patient-therapist similarity with regard to religious values may be one of the best predictors of a successful outcome.  The authors examine, compare, and contrast the four primary worldviews currently in psychology which are humanism, utopianism, new age, and Biblical.  They agree that Christian therapists in nonprivate domains have the right and obligation to counsel Christian clients from a biblical perspective.<br />They explain that the evangelical Christian community is defined by several nonnegotiable core beliefs but beyond that there are diverse strategies in Christian counseling that the authors examine.  They range from secular psychology by Christian practitioners to \\"Bible only\\" methods that reject all psychology.  The authors then attempt to find a balanced integration of theology and psychology.  It centers on helping a client to realize his new identity in Christ.  The authors present a Biblical strategy for Christian counseling that involves three levels of conflict and seven steps to freedom. The seven \\"Steps to Freedom in Christ\\" is process that the counselor assists the client in working through where a person takes a moral inventory and makes a commitment to truth.<br />In order for a counselor to be effective he must be growing himself.  Several recommendations are for growth are given. The subject of assessing client's spiritual condition is examined.  The obstacles in counseling in the marketplace are discussed and an explanation of how to present the Gospel in that setting.  Issues involving the reality of managed care are also considered.  A large section of the book is given to the subject of counseling tools.  A summary is given concerning each of these tools.  They include cognitive-behavioral therapy, theophostics, and a therapy plan for the following issues: bonding; early recollections; eating disorders; grief and loss; physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; parenting issues; anxiety disorders; depression; boundaries; dissociative identity disorder; marriage communication; sexual addiction; and chemical addictions.<br />The book examines the issue of the professional Christian therapy and the church community as a collaborative partnership.  A model for the interrelationship between the church and the Christian counselor is given.  This includes how to establish a freedom ministry in the local church and the logistics and related issues in organizing such a ministry.  Finally there is an extensive appendix that includes forms to be used in counseling ministry within the local church.<br />At the center of the book is Neil Anderson's 7 steps to freedom.  This treatment plan is both Biblical and practical.  I am confident that in many cases the 7 steps have brought individuals into new levels of freedom and wholeness.  Yet the authors seem to promote the 7 steps as a panacea for nearly every mental health disorder.  In my opinion this may be too simplistic and unrealistic.  I also feel the book falls short in being a definitive integration of psychology and theology.  This is unquestionably a Herculean task that was valiantly engaged but I felt the book fell short of fully satisfying this objective.<br />Despite its shortcomings, Christ Centered Therapy is a valuable work that should prove to be a wonderful resource for pastoral counselors and Christian mental health professionals as well as a quality textbook for seminaries and Christian colleges.  The authors do a good job of exposing the anti-Christian bias in psychology and of explainingthe different views of counseling in the Christian community.  They have a great respect for the power of God's Word and the work of the Holy Spirit in counseling.

Wilkerson does an outstanding job of bringing the passage to life while challenging the reader to apply its truths.  Over the years I've prayed the prayer of Jabez over my own life and shared its truth with others, seeing supernatural results.  I was excited to see that someone had written a book about the prayer.

They are supernatural power, worship, prayer, leadership, fellowship, vision, evangelistic passion and discipleship.  The book is written from the perspective of a Southern Baptist church consultant who combines the experience of both a practitioner and a consultant.

Strobel was an atheist who went through this same investigative journey that led to faith in Christ.  By comparing this spiritual investigation to actual investigative journalism, Strobel makes his apologetic exciting and interesting for the average reader.  Methodically and meticulously the evidence is investigated:  Can the biographies of Jesus be trusted? Do they stand up to scrutiny? Have they been reliably preserved? Is there credible evidence for Jesus outside the biographies? Does archaeology confirm or contradict the biographies? Is the Jesus of history the same as the Jesus of faith? Was Jesus really convinced that He was the Son of God? Was Jesus crazy when He claimed to be the Son of God? Did Jesus fulfil the attributes of deity?  Did He match the identity of Israel's Messiah? Was Jesus' death a sham and His resurrection a hoax? Was Jesus' body really absent from the tomb? Was Jesus seen alive after His death on the cross? Are there any supporting facts that point to the resurrection? What does the evidence establish and what does it matter?<br />These questions are answered through interviews with leading conservative scholars, theologian and philosophers.  The book is compelling and should be read by any person seriously seeking for the truth about the claims of Christ.	2000-10-24

It is not a powerful apologetic or a theological masterpiece but it is a great introduction into the study of who Jesus Christ really is.  The foundation of the book is based on the three primary possibilities for who Christ is; Lord, liar or lunatic.  This is backed up with a defense of the reliability of the Scriptures, an argument from changed lives over history and an argument for Christ's resurrection.  I highly recommend the book to those wanting an introduction to who Jesus really is.  The book will probably not convinced the hardened skeptic, but for many, it will be an opportunity for God to open their hearts and minds to the truth, that when received by faith, can transform their lives.  If you are looking for apologetics, I recommend Ravi Zacharias, J.P Moreland or Norman Geisler.  For a deeper examination of the claims of Christ from another skeptic turned Christian, you may want to check \\"The Case for Christ,\\" by Lee Stroble.	2000-10-13

Raising up truly indigenous churches, the role of culture and the dynamic of spiritual warfare are among the topics of study.  I found the work to be filled with balanced and relevant insights from some of the finest missiologists and theologian in the world.  Authors include John Stott, Johannes Verkuyl, Walter Kaiser, Don Richardson, Donald McGavarn, Peter Wagner and many others.  The book is actually a condensed research library on the subject of world missions.  I highly recommend Worldwide Perspectives to missionaries, pastors, church leaders and all those interested in world missions today.	2000-10-01

John Maxwell has done a superb job of summarizing the subject of leadership into one interesting, practical, and fairly comprehensive 233-page book. The book is simple enough for a high school freshman to study and significant enough for a business executive to ponder.  Maxwell is an expert at finding the best material in the field and re-packaging it with his own master touch. He has undoubtedly become the top expert on leadership in the church and may prove to be the top teacher of leadership in the secular arena as well.  In the 21 Laws, he looks at the invaluable necessity of leadership, how leadership is influence, how it involves a process and the way to create a leadership legacy.  Maxwell discusses leadership qualities like vision, trust, respect and sacrifice.  He also examines the skills of team building, communication, empowerment, intuition, time management and mentoring.  Each of the 21 laws includes an interesting real life historical example.  From the rookie youth pastor to the Fortune 500 exec, I highly recommend The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.	2000-09-26

It could serve as a textbook on church administration but it reads  like a novel.  The book is ideal for a novice Christian Education Director  but is a good refresher for any administrator.  It is full of textbook type  lists but the story line keeps your interest.  Grenz examines planning,  goal setting, decision-making, team building, motivation, conflict  management, time management, delegation and communication.

Instead, Bob Russell relates  ten basic principles for healthy church growth that have been tried and  proven extremely effective in the laboratory of the local church.  Southeast Christian Church is a church Christ is using to make a big  difference in their community and one other churches should learn from.  Though Bob argues for his personal preference in worship style and church  government, the emphasis of the book is a presentation of universal  principles for effective church ministry.  Within the ranks of  Bible-believing Christians, &quot;When God Builds A Church&quot; is very  inclusive and non-sectarian.  The book is vision inspiring, faith  challenging and \\"real life\\" practical.  The best thing about the book is  that it leaves you believing if God can do something great through Bob, He  can do something great through me.  I highly recommend the book to all  pastors and church members wanting to grow a healthy and effective church.	2000-08-01

Three men worked together on the book but they needed a fourth, a novelist.  The story was poorly  written, boring and couldn't keep my interest.  I expected so much more  from Hybels and Blanchard.  At the same time, if you get passed the poor  writing and boring story line, the content is exceptional.  My  recommendation is for the reader to skip to the checkpoints beginning on  page 171.  They are valuable and worth the cost of the book.  Servant  leadership is greatly needed and seldom understood.  This book will help  define it, explain it and assist you in putting it into action.	1999-11-26

Our position in Christ is one of  sitting, our life in the world is one of walking and our attitude toward  Satan is one of standing.  The Christian's entire life is to be founded and  lived out from the finished work of Jesus. In it's 78 pages the book  concisely sums up a massive amount of Biblical theology and applies it to  the believer's every day life.  Watchman Nee takes the grand theological  treatise of Ephesians and breaks it down into simple, memorable and  practical statements.  \\"Christianity begins not with the big DO, but with a  big DONE\\" (pg. 14).  \\"The all important rule is not to \\"try\\" but to  \\"trust,\\" not to depend upon our own strength but upon His\\" (pg. 38).  \\"Our  task is one of holding, not of attacking.  We do not fight for victory, we  fight from victory\\" (pg. 55).  This is only a sampling of many profound  statements, which have launched hundreds of sermons.  The spiritual truths  outlined in Sit, Walk, Stand are simple but profound, critical but often  forgotten.  The book is a great source for reminding us of these truths.  Most of the works of Watchman Nee are wonderful.  I recommend the novice to  his writings start with this one.  It is easy and quick to read yet covers  the key understandings further explained in his larger volumes.	1999-10-23

In Victory over the Darkness, Neil Anderson provides a guide for healing of past wounds and for experiencing future victory. In Victory over the Darkness Dr. Anderson doesn't suggest change through behavior modification  or external rules and regulation.  Instead he gets to the issue of living  according to our identity in Christ.  His sections on healing past wounds  and how to continue on the journey of spiritual maturity were very good.  I  appreciate that this book on emotional health was based on theology and not  psychology.  I believe it is a good, practical tool for the pastor and for  the Christian mental health professional. While the book was strong in  emphasizing our new identity in Christ, I felt it was weak in exposing the  depravity of self.  I've found that until a person abandons all hope in the  self-life they will have difficulty rejecting it for their new life in  Christ.  This book would be a good book to read in tandem with  Christ-Esteem by Don Matzat.  I see them as being an effective balance for  each other.	1999-10-16

He explains that the majority of churches are archaic in style, irrelevant to the culture and impotent to impact society.  With the  nation in dire moral straits, it needs the church to rise up to be salt and  light.  Barna charges the church to take up this mantel and then gives a  prescription of necessary changes. Barna does a fine job of explaining the  problems and challenges facing the America church.  He also lists her  shortcomings.  His assessment and indictments were blunt and fairly  accurate.  I felt his comment about America that we have done a  \\"repositioning of religion as a commodity that we consume, rather than one  in which we invest ourselves\\" was accurate and inditing.  I also felt his  list of solutions were viable and worth embracing.  Barna's passion comes  across in the pages of the book. I recommend the book to anyone interested  in a new church reformation.	1999-10-13

Foster examines the inner disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting and study.  Then he looks at the outward disciplines of simplicity, solitude,  submission, and service.  He gives many illustrations for practical  application. Celebration of Discipline can serve as a textbook for a  journey into the spiritual disciplines.  Though I've been a longtime  practitioner of these disciplines, I was instructed, encouraged and  motivated by the book.  In an age of style over substance, Celebration of  Discipline is penicillin for our superficiality. At times I felt Foster  left teaching principles and practice, to indulge in preferences.  Foster's  own personal convictions on simplicity must not be understood as absolutes  but as opinions.  I also disagreed with his encouragement on page 28 to  \\"ponder a picture of Lord.\\"  It is my belief, and that of many other  believers, that such a practice can lead to a violation of the second  commandment. That aside, I highly recommend the book.	1999-09-04

The Turn-Around church is a study of declining churches who made a comeback from the jaws of death. Barna tell us \\"This book is a modest attempt to provide a systematic study of why churches fail and how some of  these dying ministries were revived and brought back to a glorious state of  health.\\" The book examines the cycles of growth and decline that face any  ministry and the symptoms of decline.  Eleven factors are identified that  were present when a dying church was restored to wholeness.  The type of  pastor who turns-around a declining church is examined.  Strategies for  growth and ways to avoid a decline are also presented.  The book would be a  terrific resource for a dying church who wanted to reverse the cycle. Also  for a pastor who is considering assuming the role of a turn-around leader.  I also thought much of the insight applied to pastors wanting to transition  a church before decline sets in.  I like reading Barna but didn't consider  this one of his better books.  Much of the material seemed like a repeat.  But it would be invaluable to those considering a turn-around.	1999-09-04

It could be called a \\"how to\\" book on revival.  Among numerous issues concerning revival, the book looks at the invaluable necessity of prayer for revival,  how to pray for revival, how to promote revival, how to preach for a  revival and the hindrances to revival. The strength of the book is the  authority of the author.  It is one thing for theological academia to muse  about the nature of revival, it is quite another when the leader of  national revival shares from genuine experience.  The book contains much  concerning the practical aspects of revival. Personally, I found his  teaching on prayer for revival to be the most helpful.  It included  powerful personal testimonies and real life examples. The book comes from a  strong Armenian viewpoint.  I thought many of Finney's insights did not  align with Biblical truth.  Some of his applications, like the problem of  barking dogs and chewing tobacco in church are no longer relevant for most  American churches. Despite that, this book is mandatory reading for any  serious student of revival and valuable reading for anyone desiring to  experience it.	1999-08-14

But by the end, you thoroughly understand the concepts  he presents.  This book was an important key to my growth as a Christian.  In my opinion, it should be a must read for every person serious about  living a God honoring life.	1999-06-05

Beginning of the End is a very enjoyable read. Obviously he comes from a Pre-Millennial, Pre-Tribulational viewpoint. Sometimes the book reads more like a novel than a study on eschatology. I feel Rev. Hagee's  interpretation is often more isogetical (based on current events) than  exegetical (based on the Scripture). Yet, his writing style is enjoyable  and his speculations are interesting. I recommend the book but would  encourage people to also investigate other authors on the subject  (Pentecost, Ice, Walvoord).	1999-06-04

It is scholarly, yet written for the average reader.  The charts included in the book are both simple and helpful.  Ice's teaching on the  pre-tribulation rapture is a sensational piece of work.  The greatest flaw  of the book is occasional contradictions.  This may come from different  authors presenting their theories.  I also found a couple of significant  misprints.  In my opinion the strongest part of the book is in the  beginning, it falls off a little toward the end.  Not nearly as  comprehensive as Things To Come by Pentecost but I enjoyed it more.  I  highly recommend it for anyone studying prophecy.	1999-05-31

Though some of the extensive input from other sources used archaic and technical language. I found reading the  entire book enriching but it could also serve as a reference book on  eschatological issues. Personally I prefer the writings of Thomas Ice on  this subject but I do not believe Ice has ever written a book this  exhaustive.  Many consider Pentecost's work the definitive textbook on the  subject. Among pre-mill, pre-trib student of the Bible, this book is a  classic. I highly recommend it.	1999-05-17

Ryrie is essentially an apologetic for dispensationalism.  It is both an exposition and a defense of the dispensational system of Biblical interpretation.  The book was  written to correct some misconceptions about dispensationalism and to give  a positive presentation of normative dispensational teaching.  Ryrie's  arguments are cogent, consistent and pertinent. The book is very readable  and does not require extensive theological training to understand. I  especially appreciated the considerate and loving spirit Ryrie had  throughout his work.  He defended his case and exposed weaknesses he saw in  other viewpoints without a spirit of arrogance or divisiveness.  All of my  questions about and struggles with dispensationalism were not answered, but  the book gave me a clear understanding of the position.  It would be an  important read for anyone investigating this subject.	1999-05-13

Instead of finding our value through possessions,  performance and other people's opinions of us, we can base our value on our  intrinsic worth through creation and redemption.
