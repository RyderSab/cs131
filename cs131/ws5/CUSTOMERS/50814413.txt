Okay, I am relatively new to the quilting scene and in the process of this exciting new hobby, I have accumulated a lot of quilting books.  I'm not real interested in the \\"block\\" designs and applique seems to appeal to me more. This book has wonderful, fresh, cottage look and feel designs and the applique designs of course can be interchanged.  I just used the applique design and kind of winged a border and it turned out awesome!  The color schemes are like I said, fresh! However what made this book a \\"keeper\\" in my eyes is the instructions for binding.  I had a friend show me the ropes when it came to binding, but I remained freaked out and dreaded this final step.  Every quilt book I get I instantly check out the binding directions to see if, along with my friends instructions, will make it all seem less daunting.  Well, these are the BEST instructions I've found.  I have actually recommended this book for some other beginner quilter, if only for the binding instructions.  Great book and like I said, A KEEPER FOR A QUILT BOOK COLLECTION!	2005-05-06

The book was just very boring.  The characters were boring, there was really no plot except for maybe Ayla being pregnant, which of course lasts the entire book.  There was no tension; nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat.  In ten to twenty years whent the last book in the series comes out, I think I'll wait for it in paperback.	2002-05-21

Maybe some new ideas, some new way of teaching or explaining concepts.  However, sadly, it didn't happen.  I've casually looked through the book and that is probably as far as it will go.  If you are considering this book; and you have other instructional painting and drawing books, save your money, because all the information in your other books is in this one.	2002-05-08

JoAnn Ross is really one of my favorite authors, however this book just did not really do it for me.  I thought it was totally predictable.  Another reviewer stated that it was a tear-jerker........where was that?  That must have been the parts I skimmed or skipped. I will read the other two novels, however I do hope they improve a bit.	2002-05-08
US	50814413	R7J2VAVRGKVD1	0812565401	232773215	Mystic Dreamers	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Pretty good read!	Rosanne Bittner is one of my favorites so it wasn't hard to jump right in and start reading.  This I consider a good start to a trilogy that follows with two more books. I thought it interesting that elements of Magical Realism, more often found in Latin American literature, were found in this novel.  It actually surprised me..........though it was appropriate and added so much to the novel. Without it, the novel would really be just like any other American Indian story.  Good Read.	2002-05-08

Unfortunately, I purchased this book looking for detailed instructions on how to keep score.  While there is a section for this, it's very brief and did not suit my needs.  4 stars however, for the informative history of scorekeeping.  Very interesting and entertaining to read.	2002-05-02

I enjoyed Chocolat and Blackberry Wine so much, I couldn't wait for the paperback of Five Quarters of the Orange to come out in June, so I went to the UK site and ordered it.  I couldn't wait to receive it and get started.  Sadly, I was disappointed. There really were no characters in this novel you really &quot;cared&quot; about. I found myself admiring 9 year old Framboise' grit, but just didn't &quot;care&quot; for her much. France itself seemed such a vital part of the novels, Chocolat and Blackberry Wine, yet this novel lacked the charm which appealed to me in those novels. I also bought Coastliners at the same time I ordered this one and I'm actually filled with more trepidation than excitement to begin reading it.  I still enjoy Joanne Harris, and will continue to read her novels, but this was just not one I would recommend to my friends or choose to read again.	2002-03-25

I bought two of the books in the 3 book series. The writing is excellent, however, what good is a &quot;field guide&quot; if illustrations are not included for all of the featured plants and animals? If the publisher is ever going to consider a new edition, perhaps this could be taken into consideration.  I will keep these books, however still look for a &quot;Field Guide&quot; that offers more reference material.	2002-02-11

This was a fascinating historical novel, that I could not put down!  Anna, the main character, I found to be a bit predictable, but the Rector - wow, what a complicated character!  Reading to the end of the novel, it was his character that left me really thinking about everything that had transpired throughout the story.  I won't give it away here, but Mr. Mompellion is not as he seems...........If you enjoyed &quot;The Dress Lodger,&quot; you will truly enjoy this book as well.	2001-09-18

My friends love to receive mail from me and the post office has even commented on how cool my &quot;mail&quot; is!  This book is a must have, it's one of the best books I own.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. Laugh at loud funny and a real page turner.  The main character, Althea is so likable you find yourself really cheering her on.  I would have liked to have read about Patrick's life a bit more. I felt there were aspects of his character that could have been explored further, but it doesn't take away from the story at all. I'm definately going to read some more of this author's books.	2001-06-17

Unwrapping the packaging with anticipation, I was greeted with a beautiful looking book. However, upon opening it and reading it, I became so depressed!  This book, like the earlier reviewer claims, appears to be a &quot;thrown-together book&quot; with old, unfresh ideas. The publisher and author are trying to jump on the current trend of sketchbook journaling.  How unfortunate. I'm returning my copy.	2001-06-10

Ughhhhhhhh, after reading the back of the book, it sounded so good, but I cannot get past the loving God, and Lord, and Savior............blah, blah, blah..Don't get me wrong, I'm a Christian, but this is like being in a room with one too many Born Again Christians breathing down your neck.  I finally could only make it to page 29..........&quot;Hilda had known Jesus as her Savior for a long time, and He had been a faithful friend.  She clearly remembered the wonderful day she came to truly know and love Him as if it were yesterday.&quot; (29)  I'm sorry but if I want to be preached to and beat over the head about God's love, I can go to church.	2001-05-15

This is one of those books not designed to rush through to get to the end, the end doesn't matter.

I actually am a lover of Paris and photography, and of course who can resist a dog, let alone two?  I really hope the authors make this into a series, maybe London, Florence, Venice?  The book reads like a childrens book, but the target audience does seem to be aimed at adults.  Whomever reads this book, it's enjoyable and one of my favorites!	2001-01-08

This book may be to simple for some of those &quot;pro&quot; photographers, but it was just what I needed. Usually I buy books like this and read them like a magazine, looking at the pictures, and sometimes reading a caption or two.  Well, I decided to actually &quot;read&quot; this one, like a &quot;real book,&quot; and I'm so glad I did.  I learned a lot!  Some of the simple ideas for capturing the &quot;essence&quot; of a city were tips I certainly could have used on my trip to Europe last summer.  I think what I like best about this book however, is how Bob Krist turns typically boring technical tips into easily understood ideas that I can &quot;use.&quot;  Of course the photo's are beautiful too.  I highly suggest reading this book before you go anywhere with your camera!	2000-12-31

Though this was a good book, (as in entertaining, easy, quick read), I had a hard time &quot;liking&quot; the weak woman Amanda.  I could not feel much sympathy for her.  I realize she was an example of the times and she responded to her situation how probably most women would in 1919, however I wanted her to be more &quot;likable.&quot;  Ruth on the other hand was a strong woman, overcoming obstacles placed in her path resulting from the lies and secrets of her Aunt.  I did find myself caught up in the &quot;mystery&quot; of the story, and didn't really predict the outcome as early as some other reviewers seem to have.  Good book, an entertaining read for a rainy day.	2000-10-29

This was a snoozorama to say the least.  I guess I can  only hope for improvement in the 3rd novel.

My only complaint was that it was rather slow at first.  I just wanted them to get to the dang island.  It took too long to get to the &quot;good&quot; part.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I wish Roberts would have explored the reasons behind Tory's fathers rage and history of abuse.  I just felt that was never really  explored;  Or even the relationship between her two parents.

Friar Felix is an entertaining, well  developed character, while others I kept asking myself, why are they here?  The images of the 15th century, created by Holman with her vivid  descriptions of vomit, pus, ooze and any other vile concoction is effective  and had me wrinkling my nose at all the appropriate times.	2000-02-27
