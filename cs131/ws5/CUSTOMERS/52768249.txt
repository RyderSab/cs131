Our protagonist, Billy, gets a promotion, her husband's complete devotion, and the affections of a co-worker all after getting a jade frog from her therapist.  Overnight, her life is changed.<br /><br />Uh, hello?<br /><br />I'm not opposed to this particular plot, but it's carried out to the extreme.  When Billy tries to get rid of the lucky charm, it keeps reappearing in her room.  I like the fact that she confronts her past demons, but doing so through the help of a therapist's charm is just too much.<br /><br />I enjoy the Red Dress Ink series, but this one is a bit over the top- even for the most \\"escapist\\" of readers.	2005-09-02

Gehrman has created a wealth of interesting characters in an off-beat and quirky book.  Like the free spirited setting of Santa Cruz, so is our main character, Claudia Bloom.  The inner workings of Claudia's past, present, and future all come together beautifully, but not without the requisite twists and turns, including a tumultuous childhood, unstable family members, and the love of her life- who just happens to be married.<br /><br />This is a great read and another unique addition to the RDI series.	2005-08-02

I read this after having it recommended to me by several coaches who work in my school.  Typical.  This book is written for those who read a book maybe once a year.  The dialogue is ridiculous, the story line trite, and the characters are so stereotypical, it's insulting.<br /><br />Save yourself the trouble!	2005-06-08

Dalton Moss is a typical events planning assistant- She's selfish, materialistic, and does what she wants with little regard to others.  However, through the course of the novel, she begins to understand how her actions and affections affect those around her.  In Amanda Hill's novel, Love Like That, we see what happens when 25 year old \\"Doll\\" tries to have it all.<br /><br />The book is oddly compelling, especially since we aren't sympathetic to Dalton at first.  As the plot moves along, we begin to appreciate her naivete and the way she learns about love and life and everything in between.<br /><br />Looking into the life of Dalton Moss is sometimes like watching a car accident, but rest assured that there is redemption in the end. This is a good afternoon read!	2005-04-15

There are \\"vital stats\\" placed within the novel, but not for all characters; so this can't be described as a character study.  The characters are attempting to be single, independent career women, yet they all rely on the men in their lives for even the most basic of necessities.  Platonic relationships are explored, though none remain so, (with the exception of the gratuitous gay friend) which gets a bit tiresome towards the end of the novel.  Finally, the whole \\"sleeping over\\" theme just gets ridiculous after a while.<br /><br />Technically, the narrators jump all over the place and the point of view gets confusing.  There is little consistency and little plot.  Overall, I had a hard time figuring out what these characters are all about and where they're headed.  Ballis gives us no reason to care about them.<br /><br />It's too bad, though.  I always look forward to my new RDI novels, but this is one that could have been missed.	2005-04-09

While I thought the characters were a bit implausible, the plot worked for me.  This book reads like a softer, gentler episode of \\"The Sopranos\\".  I found myself caught up in the overall motion of the story and I enjoyed reading about Henry and Grace's cross-country adventure.  The secondary characters were entertaining, as well.<br /><br />I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book.  True, if you're looking for highbrow fiction, then this isn't the novel for you.  However, if you're looking for a unique story that's not too terribly taxing on the brain cells, then Sweet and Vicious will deliver.	2005-04-04

I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found the character of Samantha to be humorous and delightful.  I enjoyed getting an insider's view of what life is really like on the Hill and how rivalries are formed and how \\"unifiers are unificated.\\"  Samantha's BlackBerry adventures are a nice twist on the \\"e-relationship\\" theme and her neuroses are somewhat endearing.  (However, the fish stuff gets a little ridiculous!)<br /><br />If you are a fan of The Nanny Diaries or The Devil Wears Prada, then you will certainly enjoy this novel.  It's smart, fun, and one you won't want to put down.	2005-03-16

Elise Juska's novels are just never what I quite expect them to be.  Looking for a light read, I picked up The Hazards of Sleeping Alone.  Little did I know that my reading lamp would burn late into the night with this heartwarming and surprisingly complex novel.<br /><br />Charlotte is a divorcee who has left her family home for the \\"simpler\\" condo life.  Her \\"master of many causes\\" daughter lives with her boyfriend in New Hampshire, so she is left alone with her memories and her fears.  Throughout the story, we see her complicated relationship with Emily (her daughter) progress and we see Charlotte begin to learn more about herself and her many neuroses.<br /><br />This novel is actually a rather in-depth character study of Charlotte. We learn enough about her past and present to truly understand her and care about what happens to her.  As the novel evolves, we begin to care more and more about the secondary characters, as well.<br /><br />I loved this book.  It was touching, biting at times, but ultimately, it was true.  I highly recommend this one!	2005-03-08

In Marian Keyes' latest novel, we see the lives of three women whose lives are intertwined.  What I like about Keyes' style is the way she carefully connects the stories without them seeming forced or unbelieveable.<br /><br />The three women, Lily, Gemma, and JoJo, are all modern women who are going through some very real circumstances.  Lily is coping with new motherhood and writer's block, Gemma is trying to help her mother and herself cope after her father leaves for a younger woman, and JoJo is trying to remain successful and feminine in a world not especially conducive to both.<br /><br />Keyes' prose is beautifully written and she smacks of truth.  (\\"All men are cowards\\" for example!)  You will get caught up in the story almost immediately and won't want to put the book down even for a second.<br /><br />I've read all of Keyes' books and this one is a sure-fire winner: a great book by a great author.	2005-02-05

In this latest offering from Red Dress Ink, we read about Declan's rise to fame, Kyra's \\"crash\\" and how they both cope with tabloids, paparazzi, and instant fame.<br /><br />This book is highly entertaining and gives, what appears to be, an \\"authentic\\" insight into the life of a Hollywood celeb.  The plot is interesting, the characters likeable, and I was rooting for Kyra and Dec throughout the entire novel.  You'll never look at a tabloid magazine in the same way again!  This is a fun and enjoyable read.	2005-01-28
US	52768249	RG4U6LGU39DAE	1400051452	50839627	Wedding Season	Books	3	9	15	N	N	17 weddings and a funeral	So, there isn't technically a funeral in the novel.  The funeral, in my opinion, should be held for the plot of this ho-hum novel.  The protagonist, Joy Silverman, is not the marrying kind.  Despite this fact, she has to endure seventeen weddings of her family and friends.  Sounds like the makings for a great social comedy, right?  Well, this one falls a bit short.<br /><br />Joy's cynical personality gets annoying at times, and while some of her friends' characters have so much personality, they end up as ridiculous stereotypes for the most part.<br /><br />While this book has a different take on the concept of modern marriage, its lackluster plot was ultimately a disappointment to this avid reader.	2005-01-13

Rachel Benjamin isn't too thrilled about her friend's choice of groom, but she's going to be in the wedding anyway.  But how happy can she be when he ends up dead the night before the wedding?  In this mystery/romance, Jennifer Sturman proves that she is the modern girl's answer to Agatha Christie.<br /><br />Rachel attempts to investigate the crime, mostly for her own purposes, but also because she cares for her friend, too.  The result is a funny and ultimately satisfying mystery!  This is a nice change of pace from the usual RDI novel.  You'll like it!	2005-01-11

Jennifer Weiner's books are so far beyond the typical \\"boy meets girl\\" formula that she has basically developed her own genre.  Each of her novels just keeps getting better.<br /><br />In her latest novel, Little Earthquakes, we see four women and the changes that motherhood brings.  There's no sugar-coating here, as Weiner's characters attempt to have it all- success, happy marriages, beautiful children, and careers.  Her characters are realistic and the story lines well-written.  Her writing is empowering as well as entertaining.<br /><br />If you are looking for quality \\"chick lit\\" or for a novel with more substance than the norm, then read this book.  You will laugh and cry right along with Rebecca, Ayinde, Kelly, and Lia as they find themselves in the most challenging and beautiful moments of their lives.	2005-01-11

While the second book is entertaining, it is certainly not the showstopper that the first one was.<br /><br />Girl is a fairly typical 20-something trying to live the single girl life.  Her adventures through modern HR are very humorous at times, as any recent college grad can attest.  However, the characters seem a bit dull (particularly her \\"boyfriend\\") and not all that memorable.  There is no real synthesis and the book, as many other reviewers have pointed out, seems a bit disjointed in places.<br /><br />Overall, the book is funny and an entertaining weekend read.  Just don't get your hopes up too high.	2005-01-11

After the election, after all of the \\"what ifs\\" have been hashed to pieces, it's nice to sit back and read something intelligent and funny about the state of U.S. politics.  The writers of The Daily Show have proven themselves as first rate satirists with this book.  \\"America\\" is smart, sassy, and an absolute riot.  Juvenile humor is carefully placed and the historical material is dead on.  My only complaint is that I can't use this in my high school classroom-- The Supreme Court pictures keep that from happening.  But then, I have to wonder...which should be kept from young and impressionable minds?  Material about the current state of lobbyists and their interests or naked pictures of the Supreme Court?  Ah, a question the writers of this book no doubt intended for readers to ponder!  Read it, enjoy it, and laugh again and again.	2004-11-07

Ladies, if you have been wondering if he loves you/loves you not, here's your foolproof chance to find out.  Handy checklists, his and her opinions, and real-life scenarios make this book a fun as well as insightful read.  You'll find yourself thinking, \\"Hey!

This book has lots of action and isn't a typical \\"boy meets girl\\" story.

Topics of true love and infidelity are sources for wonderful drama and plot twists, but Matthews' venture into the above themes falls a bit short.<br /><br />Teri Carter trips and falls on the train platform, and yes, her dream man saves her.  Of course, her dream man (Jamie) is also someone else's dream man, and Teri is crushed.  This doesn't stop her from pursuing the affair and kicking her best friend (who left her cheating husband) out of her house.  I found it difficult to really empathize with either character, as much of the dialogue is trite and seems forced at times.  The story's ending is equally simplistic and leaves the reader hanging as to the future of the star-crossed lovers' relationship.<br /><br />This makes for a fast Sunday afternoon read, but there are other Red Dress Ink titles that are far more interesting and captivating.  Leave this one on the platform after reading.	2004-10-25

Think of Anastasia Krupnik all grown up and you'll get Phoebe Fine.<br /><br />Phoebe's life is going nowhere in the Big Apple, so she returns to suburban New Jersey and its shopping center landscape to put the pieces back together.  Her mother has cancer, their house is falling apart, and even her \\"perfect\\" sister Emily seems to be losing some of her polish.<br /><br />Throw in some fake Eastern Europeans, a broken viola, an old elementary school crush, and a really lousy first date, and this novel somehow comes together.  I think my favorite character might actually be Jorge, Emily's South American Jewish lawyer husband and his awkward English.<br /><br />Rosenfeld's prose isn't always pretty, but her characters are unique and a blast to read.

Anna Medina is a lost, confused, and utterly depressed 25 year old SF data entry clerk.  With the help of her friends, she goes in search of her dead father's long lost luthier friend.  Her mission?  To learn a trade and to help her father die another death.  She meets some wayward locals and through her experiences with them, her icy emotions begin to melt and she emerges a new and fresher creature.<br /><br />This is not a typical \\"boy-meets-girl\\" kind of story.  Anna is broken, as are the people around her.  Gehrman adds enough hippie references to keep the story interesting but doesn't overkill and make the plot cheesy.  We sympathize with Anna and admire her willingness to help herself and help those around her.  This is a great story--not sappy, not over the top, but one that will touch your heart as you long for a gin and tonic.	2004-10-07

At first, the idea of a celebrity moving in (temporarily) with the prez of his fan club in middle of nowhere West Virginia seems kind of corny, right?  But Cochran's Mean Season is so much more than what first meets the reader's eye.<br /><br />We see a protagonist, Leanne, who is struggling to find herself within a dysfunctional family. Her life is as real as it gets--and she doesn't live in L.A. or NYC and doesn't work in publishing.  We see the price of fame and fortune and \\"worldly\\" success in her houseguest, Josh, who has struggled to overcome similar small-town roots.  We see the consequences of small-town life and its positives and negatives.

Heather attempts to find herself, her roots, and a little romance in between filming a live Seder for the Food Network with her more than dysfunctional family.  The book is fast paced and full of information about Jewish dietary laws and practices.  But don't let that fool you...there is lots of story packed in, as well.<br />I applaud Shapiro for creating a great summer read that educates as well as delights.	2004-07-07

This book will answer your questions as to why one struggles with crazy bosses, unreasonable working conditions, and industry madness all while being at the bottom of the corporate food chain.<br />Elizabeth Miller leaves the static world of D.C. politics for Hollywood to work for The Agency, the hottest talent agency in the business.  As a second assistant she quickly learns that appearances are everything and nothing is what it seems.  We follow her through her dating and work related faux pas and successes, and meet some rather interesting characters along the way.<br />What I liked best about this book is that it isn't sugar coated or completely over the top.  Elizabeth and her co-workers are brilliantly written and the scenes from The Agency feel like a reality TV show all their own.  The book is fast paced, funny, and a great summer read.  So, if you've been looking for a break from the usual &quot;chick lit&quot; read, (I know, I'm tired of that label, too.) get a hold of The Second Assistant.  You'll have a ball.	2004-06-11

The characters and plot are as colorful as the city itself.  We see Georgia blossom not only as a blues singer but also as a woman in love.  The subplots are interesting, and though the ending is somewhat predictable, the action and dialogue will keep you reading and wanting more.  I found this to be a nice change from the NYC set, girls in publishing routine.  Orloff's writing, style, and characters definitely have an edge and make for fun summer reading, as well as a fabulous addition to the RDI series.  Read and enjoy!	2004-06-01

This is a wonderfully accessible book for those who want to learn more about punctuation but who were afraid to ask.

The story is fast-paced and a different take on the life of the single girl in the city that readers can't seem to get enough of these days.<br />Tallulah West is an aspiring designer whose father is well-known in the field.  However, she doesn't want to use her father's connections because of the anger she feels towards him over the way he handled her mother's death.  There is much to be resolved here, and Tallulah must face this personal issue before she can muster the courage to go out and make it on her own, career-wise.  The secondary characters, Nick and Hannah, also add to the action.  Both are well-meaning, and if weren't for the two of them, Tallulah would likely be stuck as someone's assistant forever.<br />The story is somewhat predictable, but so what.  It's fun and refreshing and a great springtime read.  If you are a fan of the series or if this is your first Red Dress Ink read, you'll enjoy your visit to Tallulahland.	2004-03-09

For a while, even Sunny herself believes the expense account, salons, and celeb status are worth it, too.  But, like any self-respecting chick book, Sunny realizes what she has before she loses it all.<br />Mlynowski introduces some interesting twists in this book--all involving women's issues.  Some are developed, while others are not.

Typical of the genre, Lucy is young and free and trying to find her place in the world.  The title indicates where her place will be, but the plot takes too long in getting us there.<br />Lucy's brother Dirk is constantly threatening her, but this is never fully developed or resolved.  Lucy falls in love with her brother's caseworker, and this character (Sam) suffers the same fate.

Hannity's running theme throughout this book is that &quot;evil exists&quot; and that it means to harm us.  I don't think anyone in the country would deny this assertion.  This statement is not inherently about politics or government or any of it, and this is my main disagreement with this book.  Hannity uses generalities to support his own, incredibly narrow view of politics in this country.  His broad generalizations about &quot;what liberals think&quot; are absurd and completely unfounded.  Given the tone and scope of this book, I don't think Hannity would give an admitted liberal the time of day, much less sit down for a cup of coffee to have an intelligent discussion about political theory.  It is not unpatriotic to be critical of one's leader or state of government, nor is it evil.  This kind of thinking is the true evil.<br />I read this book in order to learn more about what and how modern conservatives think. If Hannity is the poster boy, then we are all in trouble, conservatives and liberals alike!	2004-02-21

It's hard to muster much sympathy for Sarah Giles, a woman with a caring boyfriend, an exciting lover and the world at her feet.  Sarah is engaged to a Catholic banker named Paul, who is repressed in more ways than one.  At the same time, she embarks on an affair with notorious womanizer, John Wayne, who is never quite developed.  We see most of Sarah's relationships develop via text messaging, and if this is realistic, the state of romance today is in peril.<br />The title itself focuses on the fact that Sarah is engaged to be married, although the details of the actual event are sketchy.  Sarah's wedding comes and goes with little fanfare or drama, and the love triangle is poorly developed.  Perhaps this is indicative of Sarah's character?  I can't be sure.<br />I found the story to be slow and annoying at times.  There are several issues that could have been developed that would have made this story more poignant, but the plot falls a bit short.  There are much better books in the Red Dress Ink series.	2004-02-17

Topics ranging from AIDS to depression to coming of age, one would be hard pressed not to be moved, if not changed, by reading Haslett's prose.  Those looking for a light read need not apply.  Mental illness and suicide are themes that ooze through the stories like a morning fog; however, if this keeps you from reading You Are Not a Stranger Here, you will miss out on some of the most original and thought-provoking short fiction that has been published in recent years.	2004-01-08

Laura Caldwell's latest novel leaves readers with the resounding question, &quot;If you were starting over with no memory of the past, what would you do?&quot;  Ok, so maybe that's not a question that most of us ponder, but this novel elicits this as well as some other very interesting conundrums.<br />Kelly McGraw is a successful retail analyst with a great townhouse and a soon-to-be fiance.  The book opens with Kelly going around to her old haunts, and guess what?  Her keys don't fit and her boyfriend tells her to get lost.  So what has happened?  At this point I was afraid this book was going to resemble a bad Beverly Hills 90210 plot, but Caldwell instead assembles a story about love, friendship, depression, loss, and finding one's true calling.<br />This is a fast read and a thought-provoking one, too.  Enjoy this latest Red Dress Ink book and maybe you, too, will have a better idea of who you are, just as Kelly does.	2003-12-23

I respect and admire Groneberg's tenacity and will to become part of the West and to write this book.  The book takes us through Tom Groneberg's experiences as a horse trail guide, ranch hand, and ranch manager.  Gone are the perfectly dirtied cowboy hats that today's country &quot;musicians&quot; wear...Groneberg learns that life in the West is hard, cold, and unforgiving.<br />Groneberg wants so desperately to be a part of this culture, but he never fully explains why.  Perhaps this is part of the mystery of this region, the allure.  This book reminds me of a modern-day My Antonia in parts--especially his descriptions of the harsh winters he and his wife endure in Montana.<br />What I come away with after reading this memoir is that it's difficult to be a man today--especially when you're a man drawn to a hard life.  Ranching is not as simple and pastoral as it seems.  Growing up on a farm allowed me to empathize with Groneberg in parts and allowed me to predict outcomes in others.  I would encourage those who haven't had much experience with the &quot;cowboy way&quot; to read this memoir and leave the country music videos on mute.  Groneberg paints a realistic picture of what the life of a cowboy is like in the modern age.	2003-12-17

The quote on the front of the book claims that I will be reaching for the tissue box.  Well, I did.  This story was so sappy-sweet that my eyes watered up due to sugar shock.<br />I had to remind myself that I wasn't reading Bridges of Madison County, the story lines were so similar.  The characters, Paul and Adrienne, are likeable enough, but the plot is just too predictable.  From the first chapter, this book's plot can be perfectly mapped.  There are no sudden twists or turns or anything all that compelling, really.<br />I have had so many people recommend Nicholas Sparks' novels to me, and now, I have to wonder why.  I like a good romance as much as the next person, but I also would like a little plot.  I give the book two stars because I did enjoy the characters and some of the dialogue; however, most of this novel lacked &quot;sparks.&quot;	2003-12-17

The story begins with four roommates in early 1960s New York City.  Vanessa is a gorgeous flight attendant, Leigh is an aspiring casting agent, Cady is a teacher, and Susan is the misfit who annoys and aggravates the other three.  All four of these young women are attempting to find their places in the world and are adapting to a changing society.<br />This in itself would have made a great novel.  However, Jaffe takes us through these women's lives beyond the time spent in  their rented brownstone. The decades fly by and there are so many unanswered questions that it's difficult to sympathize or really grasp what has happened in the lives of the characters.  I would have liked to have known more about the intricacies and less about the broad pictures that Jaffe chooses to present.<br />There are pages and pages of seemingly unimportant information, and then...poof!  Readers are hit at the end with a startling revelation that isn't really resolved, but is instead hurried into an ending.<br />All in all, this was a disappointment for me.  However, I always enjoy Jaffe's perspective on changing women's roles, especially the sociological aspects of the early years of feminism.  This novel would have been better had she stuck to this idea.	2003-12-09

Readers are taken through a whirlwind plot that is chock full of information about Christianity, symbolism, and the Grail.  I picked up this book to see for myself as to whether or not it &quot;debunks&quot; Christianity as so many have claimed.<br />The important idea to remember while reading this book is that it is a work of fiction.  The book is well-researched and is a great mystery.  While some of the facts that Brown includes are true, the story itself is fiction.  Simple as that.  I feel that those who are critical of the novel are afraid...afraid of what they themselves do not know or understand.  I appreciate any work of fiction that compels me to go out and learn MORE--The DaVinci Code does this.  Being secure in your own beliefs is also important in truly enjoying and appreciating this book.<br />Sure, there are some holes in the plot and the &quot;truth&quot; about Sophie's family didn't come as much of a surprise.  I still enjoyed the story because Brown does a wonderful job of describing the historical structures and figures, from DaVinci to Alexander Pope and from the Louvre to Westminster Abbey.<br />So read The DaVinci Code...Enjoy it for what it is--a fascinating and exciting work of fiction that will keep you reading long into the night.	2003-12-04

His dry, biting, and intricate style is always dead-on.  What makes Martin such a great writer is that he is such a keen observer of human nature and most importantly, of human flaws.  His latest book takes this idea to a new level.<br />Daniel Pecan Cambridge is certainly flawed.  Through humor, we see what it's like to be virtually crippled by OCD and paranoia.  Although the ending is a wee bit simplistic, I believe it is probably necessary for the novella form to really work.  Martin captures so wonderfully the loneliness of Southern California life, and getting inside the mind of Daniel is a treat.  I'm glad that Martin uses this first-person style of narration.<br />Steve Martin is creative, interesting, and downright hilarious as a comedian.  As a writer, he proves with this second novella that he is all of these things and more.	2003-11-26

His stats are astounding, and Moore's humorous approach makes this otherwise technical rant truly readable and enjoyable.  I especially like the way Moore is prone to self-deprication and how this contributes to his credibility as &quot;just yer average guy.&quot;  Of course we all know Moore is much more than that- He is educated, aware, and ready to take action.<br />If you are curious as to just what the Bush administration has been up to, then by all means, READ this book.  Read it now!  It will inspire and motivate you to get involved in politics no matter what side you happen to be on.  Also included in this book is a handy guide on how to get politically involved at the local level.  This is perfect for those who feel the passion for politics and justice but do not know where to begin.  Moore's grassroots approach is what America is all about, and Dude, Where's My Country? shows us this.	2003-11-20

This book proves to be a refreshing voice in the sea of dumbed down conglomerate media. I appreciate the fact that &quot;Team Franken&quot; breaks down so much of what is happening in modern politics for those of us who have little access and limited time to debunk most of what the media feeds us.<br />Parts of the book seemed unnecessary, like the cartoons and the fictional story involving Vietnam, but all in all, the facts are there in black and white and those are what matter most.  Sure Franken can be abrasive, but that's what kept me reading.  I only wish he would have used more of his signature sarcastic humor and fewer gimmicks.  All in all, this is a great read for anyone truly wanting the FACTS about the current state of affairs in this country.	2003-11-12

Since Mark Salzman is one of my favorite writers, I couldn't wait to read his new work of non-fiction.  Lost In Place made me laugh so hard in some parts that I cried, but in True Notebooks, I cried for different reasons.<br />This book chronicles Salzman's experiences as a volunteer writing instructor in L.A.'s Central Juvenile Hall.  This could have easily been one of those memoirs where readers are taken down a &quot;feel good-I'm such a noble guy&quot; journey.  We have all seen Hollywood renditions of such situations, but Salzman doesn't portray himself as a hero.  Instead, he reveals his doubts, fears, and insecurities right along with those of the juvenile offenders he works with.<br />Without intending to, this book makes a powerful political statement as to why juveniles should not be tried as adults and how the justice system fails too many poor and minority youth.  I was moved by the writing that these young men produced, and you will be, too.  As an English teacher, I only dream of getting such work turned in to me.<br />As expected in a book such as this, there is no happy ending.  But, Salzman has truly given these young men a voice by helping each find his own through the written word.	2003-10-27

Her husband, we learn, is a pampered, ego-driven novelist who depends on his wife for support that goes beyond the call of &quot;wifely&quot; duty.  The scene is Helsinki, where Joe is going to receive the prestigious Helsinki Prize.  As always, Joan is accompanying him and through their trans-Atlantic journey, we journey through the marriage that is Joan and Joe.<br />Their marriage is filled with typical ups and downs, but so much is never explained.  As expected, Joe is a philanderer and makes no apologies for it.  Joan isn't outraged--She is hurt, but that's as much as we know.  So much is missing here that sometimes the character seems too distant.  Still, Wolitzer's prose is incredibly brilliant and a wonderful departure from the adolescent sounding narratives that have flooded bookstores as of late.<br />Of course, the &quot;surprise&quot; ending didn't surprise me at all.  I have to admit that I was a bit angered after putting the book down.  Without wanting to give too much away, my opinion of Joan was taken down a notch.  I don't feel she was redeemed at all.  But perhaps this is what life is really like.  Whatever your opinion of the events of the plot, this is a 4 star book.  Wolitzer's simple, straightforward style appeals to me.  I will definitely read her next novel.	2003-10-24

I have been a devout reader of Douglas Coupland's work and have been disappointed with basically everything since Microserfs.  Hey Nostradamus! has changed all of that.  Hey! is a critical look into modern fanatacism and the consequences of being a teenager in a world filled with guns, God, and video games.<br />The novel is divided into four parts each narrated by a different character.  The connections between the characters are at first, not obvious.  Coupland threads these misfits into a disjointed narrative that works. The first part is narrated by Cheryl, who has been killed in a Columbine-style massacre in a Vancouver high school in 1988.  Cheryl's account reminds me of Susie Salmon's in The Lovely Bones--She is telling the story from a &quot;space&quot; not heaven, not hell, not earth.  As macabre as the plot is, the style works.  Her husband's (Jason's) account is not as seamless, but his disillusionment shows well through the narrative.<br />I would have liked to have read more about Reg, Jason's religious fanatic father, but his portion of the book was cut short, I felt.  There is no obvious resolution here, but in today's world, there seldom is.  This, I believe, is Coupland's intent, or part of it, anyway.<br />For those looking for critical insight into post-Columbine, post-9/11 North America, Douglas Coupland's latest novel does not disappoint.	2003-10-15

As a teacher who spent her first years teaching in inner city schools, I was curious and excited to read Educating Esme.  I was disappointed that there was less introspection and too much self-promotion.  I would be angry if I had been another teacher at this school because by &quot;Madame&quot; Esme's accounts, she is the only one who is working there.  Her approach to teaching works for her, and I admire this and enjoyed reading about it.  She is inventive and creative and helped her students a great deal.  But, just because other teachers and administrators did not praise her every second and did not agree with all of her methodology, I felt she labeled them &quot;bad,&quot; and this is not always the case.<br />Looking in is always an enlightening experience.  I enjoyed looking into Esme's classroom and came away with many great teaching ideas.  Where this book falls short is looking at the long-term effects and their fundamental causes.  Maybe I'm just a big picture type of person, but I thought Esme came across as very self-absorbed.  A fast read, I think the title is misleading--Esme seems to believe that she has all of the education she needs.	2003-10-06

Jane Green's latest take into the &quot;chick&quot; genre ventures where very few do--right into Babyville.  The concept of this book is entertaining--different sections highlighting the three main women in the novel.  What I found most disappointing was that just when I was really sympathizing and caring about the character...poof!  We were on to the next section of the book.<br />The novel begins with Julia, who is desperate to have a baby with her partner, Mark.  This story line touches on some serious topics- infertility, abortion, marriage- but as stated earlier, once Julia leaves for New York and her &quot;time&quot; is up, that's really the last we see of her.  The story moves on to Maeve, the fiery redhead who takes Julia's place and then some, and finally to Sam, who is the most realistic of the characters.  Sam's struggle with post-partum depression is a true eye opener, but again, I felt that she was sold short being at the end of the novel when things find a way to nicely fit together.<br />This is a step up from Green's last two novels, and I recommend it.  She takes on the topic of self-concept and creates characters readers can truly understand and learn from.	2003-10-02

Trading Up picks up where Four Blondes left off in the life of Janey Wilcox, &quot;Actress/Model/Whatever.&quot;  I can't decide whether to hate Janey or admire her tenacity and ability to play the high society game, but either way, the adventures of Janey will keep you reading and wanting more.<br />This novel has much more depth than Four Blondes.  One can't help but wonder if certain names and titles are thinly veiled references to power players in the entertainment biz, and this puzzle makes the book only that much more entertaining.  And just when you think Janey is going to lose it all, she somehow manages to know the right person to get her out of trouble.  Hers is a vicious cycle that is complicated by a plethora of characters and posh surroundings.<br />It's always entertaining to read about how the other half lives, and Trading Up does not disappoint in that arena.  Added to this is a great story about an unforgettable character straight out of the tabloid mold.	2003-08-21

In this particular novel, we meet Dr. Alice Thrift, a serious and smart intern who needs some help in the social department.  She is wooed by a fudge salesman named Ray Russo, who doesn't quite sweet her off of her feet.  But...she marries him anyway.  Her tale is witty and engaging, and the other characters in the novel all do their best to help Alice become a &quot;normal&quot; woman.  Her roommate Leo and neighbor Sylvie make for some clever subplots, as well. This is the best Elinor Lipman book I've read since Isabel's Bed.  It's entertaining, interesting, and a delightfully compelling read.	2003-08-03

I think the Steve Martin quote on the back cover says it all- \\"Women aren't really like this, are they?\\"  Needless to say, Maneater is a witty and sharp insider's view into the material world of Hollywood.  Clarissa wants it all and wants it NOW.  She is a social climber who gets what she wants and doesn't let her friends (aka the Star Chamber) or her mother stop her.  She gets what she's after, all right, but her story is one that will keep you laughing, gasping, and ultimately, reading.  The characters are fresh and funny-I especially love her Bolivian/Jewish mother.  Take this novel for the satire that it is, and you will truly enjoy reading Maneater.	2003-07-30

I thought that Venus probably doesn't get to read all that much, so if she liked it... Anyway, I thought this read more like a diary than an actual novel.  The action is slow-moving and we don't really get to find out about the -real- Vivian until about 100 pages into the book.  While the style may be fresh, I found it a bit too &quot;MTV&quot;--you know, designed for short attention spans and for those who thrive on quirky one word responses.  Vivian could be a marvelous heroine, but the pace and chattiness just get in the way.  I know that many have really enjoyed the book, but I just found it to be rather cumbersome and a poor reflection of the young adult experience.	2003-07-22

This was my first Evanovich novel, and I am wondering why so many people rave on and on.  Based on other reviews, I can see that I need to try again, possibly with a Stephanie Plum book.  Full House is shallow, mindless, and only occasionally fun.  Most of the novel's plot seemed paper thin and too ridiculous to be enjoyable.<br />I read most of this by the pool, and my suggestion is that's where it's best enjoyed.  Otherwise, just don't even bother.  If you want a quick romance, try the Red Dress Ink series.	2003-07-21

In Her Shoes is no fluff novel; Tough issues are tackled and a range of characters are delicately woven throughout.  I like the way the author handles the issues of body image and promiscuity--not as fatal flaws, but as lessons to be learned from.<br />Sisters Maggie and Rose are completely different on the surface- Rose is successful and driven and Maggie is free-spirited and opportunistic.  We learn, however, that the two really have much in common.  Rose struggles with her self image, and Maggie struggles to be herself in spite of her sister's success.  Both of the sisters are grieving for their mother who died when they were young and are angry with their father and stepmother (Sydelle) for erasing her from their lives.  Also erased from their lives is a grandmother, who now lives in Florida and appears throughout the novel.<br />There is no gushy happy ending here, and I find it fitting that Maggie and Rose do not have a tearful reunion after their falling out.  In Her Shoes is an engrossing story of loss, discovery, and finding one's self in young adulthood.  If you're a fan of, say the Red Dress Ink series but are looking for a little more substance...this is the perfect book for you.	2003-07-19

After reading numerous reviews and after the NPR interview, I was really excited to read this book.  In the end, it was nothing like I expected it to be.  Instead of reading essays about career changes and interesting occupations, I felt like I was reading essays about what the author would do in each of the given situations.  I find this to be rather arrogant given most of the circumstances.  The book has much thought-provoking potential, but it falls way short.  I found Bronson's observations to be a bit short sighted and not always on target.  In the end, I was just annoyed.  This definitely would have benefitted from a more &quot;hands-off&quot; approach on the author's part. What a disappointment.	2003-07-08

The book begins with single mum, Maddy, who decides to brave her first shopping trip with her newborn.  She ends up in jail, being harrassed by her solicitor, and &quot;sweet-talked&quot; by her fellow inmates.  The story only gets more bizarre from there.  This book is clearly meant to shock, so if you're looking for sympathetic characters and a heart-warming story, keep looking.  If you're up for a psychotic ride and a unique novel, then this would make a quick and enjoyable read for you.  This just isn't my particular style.	2003-07-04

She sees a therapist, works as a temp, and suffers from odd mental malaise.  I found her insights to be believable, yet often annoying.  Having known several people like Carrie in my life, (No, I'm not a genius!!) I can relate to the ways the other characters in the novel interact with her.<br />I think this book definitely gives Red Dress Ink some credibility.  This strays from the usual poor, loveless fashion hopeless protagonist and gives us someone who readers can truly empathize with.  This is a fast read and a fabulous insight to the lonely world of &quot;geniushood.&quot;	2003-06-26

The story revolves around Will's inability to get over his &quot;legendary girlfriend,&quot; Aggi, and his reluctance to move on with his life.  The pace is slow, and there's much self-loathing.  The real action takes place at the end of the novel when Will decides to take control of his life and to get over Aggi.  But, I'm afraid that this comes a little too late.  The characters become muddled and the action gets a little too unreal for my tastes.  There are some interesting characters in the book- Kate, Alice, and Simon- but we don't learn much about them due to Will's self-centeredness.  Maybe this is the point, but I just would have liked to have seen more of these peripheral characters since they impact Will's moods and actions so much.  This is not my favorite Mike Gayle, but it still makes for a nice summer read.	2003-06-24

I even broke my own rule of book purchasing and bought it new and in hardcover.  Whoa, was I disappointed!  I expected a lot more Sex and the City and a lot less Nanny Diaries.  It was virtually the same book--just different girls in different jobs.  The main difference is that The Nanny Diaries is better written.<br />Like many of the other reviewers, the main character didn't move me at all.  I wasn't sympathetic to her plight, and her reason for staying in this job just wasn't all that realistic.  Many of the other characters had potential, but they just weren't all that developed.  I would have liked to have seen more of the \\"twins\\" and of Emily.  I would have liked to know more about Alex; however, we are only given one tyrannical phone call after another.<br />Check this out from the library or borrow your friend's copy.  But save your money for something different!	2003-06-17

Vig Morgan is a former assistant to a high profile fashion magazine editor who gets caught up in a complex plot.  Several of Vig's co-workers enlist her in an attempt to overthrow their editor, the \\"evil\\" Jane.  Like any good minion coup, there are mix-ups and complications, and Vig even falls in love along the way.<br />This book has incredible potential.  Combine this with The Devil Wears Prada, and you'd have a fabulous book.  There are thin points within the plot, and some of the characters are not developed the way I would have expected them to be.  The ending is a bit outlandish, but I'll let you judge that one for yourselves!<br />All in all, Fashionistas is a fun summer read.  Just don't expect -too- much.	2003-06-17

Plain and simple, this is a book that you have to read again and again and again just for good measure.  One cannot possibly appreciate modern American literature as it exists today without reading Huck Finn.  Twain's style is one-of-a-kind, and his keen sense of politics and history is one that rarely exists in modern times.  Get past the racial implications of this book and look at what Twain is -saying-.  Huck Finn is a character who is a rogue, a modern scoundrel; however, we trust his moral judgement and are able to look inside another time and place through his journey with Jim up the Mississippi.  So get out your maps and notebook and enjoy Twain at his finest.	2003-06-15

By itself, Lucky is a startling and sometimes horrific survival story.  Alice Sebold describes her violent attack and the subsequent events in painful clarity.  I found the descriptions of her family's and friends' reactions to be both disturbing and painfully real.  After reading the book I was left with disgust of the judicial system, fear for young women on campuses everywhere, and respect for a talented writer who is able to cut through &quot;Law and Order&quot; type detail and tell her story with the perfect balance of heart and mind. My advice?  Read them both.	2003-06-15

Mike Gayle is a talented writer who has written a story that is part Nick Hornby and part Marian Keyes.  Dave Harding is a typical guy who is happy with his life.  He loves his wife and his career, but he soon finds himself the agony uncle at a teen magazine after his music mag folds.  This is when the real story takes root.  Dave receives a letter from a young woman who believes he is her father.  The events that unfold are funny, touching, and told from a refreshingly male perspective.  I really like this character, and Gayle tells his story beautifully and without the requisite fluff.  I recommend this book to readers looking for a fresh point of view from a writer who will surely become one you will often read.	2003-06-15

She pumps her ex's neighbor for information, of course.  But is this neighbor reliable?  Phony friends and email, parent troubles, and job shifts are just a few of the topics this book hits upon.<br />This is a little different than most of the Red Dress Ink books I've read.  There are a few more characters and plot twists that keep will keep you reading late into the night, and you might even learn a lesson or two about relationships in the age of email and economic uncertainty.  It's fun, fast, and a wonderful addition to this popular series.	2003-05-20

The Los Angeles setting, the characters, the descriptions of LA club life, and the transformation of &quot;Eleanor&quot; are all entertaining and make for a perfect beach read.<br />However, the whole &quot;Odd Couple&quot; scenario has been done and re-done.  I really had hoped this novel would avoid this.  Still, L.A. Woman is fun and a nice addition to the Red Dress Ink series.  If you're a fan of the series, you'll find that this book will not disappoint.	2003-04-25

Spanish Disco is the Red Dress Ink book that I've been waiting for!  This book contains all of the elements that an uber-chick novel needs to be a true power read: an angst-ridden singleton, an understanding boss, a wise old mentor, a power job, a love triangle, trans-atlantic cyber affair, and an island paradise setting.  Don't let the kitschy cover fool you...Spanish Disco is a for real read.<br />So, if you've been reading and enjoying the Red Dress Ink series, but feel like some of the plots and characters fall a bit short, then this book will quench your thirst for a fun, yet brilliant chick novel.	2003-04-24

In this installment, we see Becky's wedding preparations and the family interaction that goes with planning such an event.  If you love the usual &quot;brand dropping&quot; that Becky does, you may be in for a surprise.  Becky has learned a lot from her early shopaholic days, and in this novel, we see a side of her that is even more likeable and endearing.  Let's just say we see the softer side of Becky and Luke.<br />There are many plot twists and turns that really keep the book moving; however, there are a few small parts that Kinsella really doesn't need (i.e. Alicia's grand entrance and Tom's confession) BUT they do add some more fun to an already fun novel.<br />Read it.  Enjoy it.  I recommend that you read the other two books before reading this one, simply because the characters stay the same and grow quite a bit.  Also, because to truly appreciate the Becky you see in Shopaholic Ties the Knot, you need to see just how far she has come.	2003-03-19

Finally there is an honest and heart-warming (without being too over the top politically correct) story for young adult readers.  The element of \\"magic\\" provides just enough of a hook to link the four young women we meet in this story.<br />The premise is simple:  A pair of thrift store jeans see four young women through an adventurous summer apart.  As the pants travel the world, we see four girls (Carmen, Tibby, Lena, and Bridget)and the drama that unfolds in each of their lives.  Their stories are powerful, intelligent, and moving.  This is no Babysitter's Club- The Pants will leave you wanting more with tears in your eyes.  Read it!	2003-03-07

She's clueless, and as her name suggests, faithful to her family and career.  Her husband of fifteen years, Peter, is not as &quot;faithful.&quot;<br />Wolff details Faith's quest for truth and love with splashes of humor and eloquence.  The novel's dialogue is entertaining and true to life, which is something not always found in the romance, chick-lit genre.  There is definitely more substance to this Red Dress Ink choice!  So, read on and meet Faith Martin, an 'everywoman' that every woman can relate to and identify with.  The characters are fun, the dialogue is witty, and Faith's journeys make for an enjoyable and insightful read.	2003-03-04

I mean, I enjoy a fluffy romance once in a little while, but this story is completely transparent and contains far too many holes.  This book reads like a sit-com, complete with the neat and tidy ending.  Some of the characters have potential, like Abe's &quot;sister&quot; and the former English teacher, but they just aren't developed and come off rather dull.  This is a shame... But, if you like a one-sitting romance read, then you might enjoy The Dominant Blonde.	2003-03-03

So why the three stars?  Well, if you are a reader of novels set in academia, then you've probably heard this story somewhere before.  This is the story of a struggling creative writing prof in a so-so town in a so-so life.  Through one of his classes, he meets a troubled young woman who happens to be a brilliant writer.  You can probably guess what happens next.  But, don't let this stop you from reading the book.  Prose has a unique style filled with dark descriptions and troubling situations.  If you're looking for original writing, then this is a good choice for you.  If you're looking for an original story, then you might want to take a look at some of Prose's other work.	2003-03-02

Books	5	0	0	N	N	Intelligent and Insightful...A Must Read	Moore's critical views of current government practice and policy are presented for your information and reading pleasure.  It is rare that a book so packed with information can also be laugh-out-loud funny.  And this is just one reason why I appreciate this book. Moore shares his opinions, but he then backs up what he says with information and with sharp analogies.  This is pure politics for the people, which is what I believe Moore advocates with this and with his other work in film and television.  Some of his arguments get tiresome at the end, and he comes off as a cranky old man.  But, the insights he makes make the read worthwhile.<br />You may not agree with all of Moore's views, but I'll bet that after reading Stupid White Men, you'll at least look at the media and American politics a little more critically.	2003-03-02

Chabon is wickedly funny, and the characters are interesting and well-presented.  Though the film is entertaining, the book is doubly so.  This is a hilarious view of campus life, so if you're a fan of the academic novel, this will surely satisfy those satirical cravings.	2003-02-28

I bought this book after reading 'Milkrun' and was excited to find that it was a nice meaty-looking book.  Looks can be deceiving.  'Fishbowl' has the potential to be a smart and funny read, but the characters are cliche and transparent.  I don't mind a little formula here and there, but this one takes the stereotypes just a little too far.  (Think Three's Company, but all female! Jodine=Janet, Allie=Chrissy, Emma=Jack)  The whole apartment fire episode is a nice plot addition, but overall, this novel falls short of expectations.	2003-02-28

The truth is that this is a work that should be recommended reading at every college campus.  Using a classic formula of good vs. evil, overlord vs. underdog, and man vs. society, Kesey takes readers through life in a now outdated, but largely stereotypical model of a mental institution.  His humor is wicked and the characters are unforgettable.  You will find yourself wondering if you are merely a cog in the wheel or if you, too, have been persecuted for being an individual.  Find out where many modern cultural references originated and read this book. Questioning authority is necessary today--possibly more than ever.	2003-02-26

But, unlike some of the other reviewers, I found this novel to be a heartbreaker.  I have been thinking about little Grayer X all day; and while I found Nanny's plight regrettable, it was Grayer who had my sympathy.<br />I don't know what self-respecting child development student would actually put up with the abuse that Mrs. X dishes out!  Maybe a bit over the top at times, and maybe a little predictable (the &quot;other woman&quot;), The Nanny Diaries is definitely well worth the read.	2002-04-20

This book is an eloquent look into the life of Cannie Shapiro, a young woman whose childhood and family have left her to pick up many pieces in her young adulthood. One of the issues that arises is Cannie's obsession with being thin.  This book does what Jane Green's Jemima J. -tries- to do.  We see Cannie's struggles in a deeper, more meaningful way than we do Jemima's.  This is what makes this book so incredible- Weiner's honest approach to writing about esteem issues and family issues and how these are intertwined. (But not in a self-helpy, whiny way!)<br />I cried like a baby at the end of this novel, so I'm not going to give anything away.  Good in Bed is much more than what the title suggests, and Weiner writes with compassion, honesty, integrity, and grit. I highly recommend this book to readers of other chick lit books who have found other characters to be less than engaging and plots less than realistic.	2002-04-12

Rebecca Bloomwood is a wonderful character, and most of us know her well.  The book picks up nicely where the first novel leaves off, and I like the way Kinsella carefully connects the two.  We are not forced to read repetitive explanations, but we are instead treated to an &quot;insider&quot; glance at Becky's sometimes charmed life.  The protagonist is clever, witty, and a delight to follow.  I especially enjoy the letters included throughout the novel- They are just hilarious and really add depth to the plot. (Remember &quot;Finnish, Finnish, Finnish?&quot;)  This is a great spring break read and a nice diversion from the typical &quot;girl chases boy and mourns the fact that she's single&quot; story.  We feel Becky's pain!	2002-03-18

Milkrun is another novel about a 20-something single, professional woman.  This novel is set in Boston, and I enjoyed the change of setting.  (Not that I'm tired of reading about NYC or London!)

While I was inspired by Jemima's quest to lose weight and enjoyed all of the theoretical questions dotted throughout the novel, I have to agree with a few of the other reviewers who believe that Green is sending a mixed message.  Sure, Jemima isn't happy with herself and feels she is being discriminated against; BUT, Green illustrates her journey through self-discovery as though it were as easy as signing a gym membership form.  I thought this was a bit too simplistic, and Green missed a great opportunity to expand upon her theme.  This novel was a nice departure from all of the self-loathing singleton stories that are out there- We are able to sympathize with Jemima, who is a genuine character.  But come on...We knew how the story would end, didn't we?	2002-03-14

Senate's tale of frustrated Manhattanite, Jane, is surprisingly moving.  I enjoyed taking a peek into the world of publishing, and the characters are realistic and entertaining.  This is a wonderful read if you are taking a little weekend trip or if you're looking for a fun diversion.  This is nothing intense, so if you're after high drama, keep looking.

Marian Keyes has written a brilliant story about a young woman trying to get through her turbulent 20s.
