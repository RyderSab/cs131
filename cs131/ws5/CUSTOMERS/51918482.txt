The author spent a great deal of time detailing the mathematical advances and controversies that spurred the technological advances we see today. Overall the book was mildly interesting, but probably not for the average reader. On the other end of the spectrum it was too much of a primer for anyone with some historical knowledge of mathematics and its part in developing computers.	2005-07-27

Sparta has reconciled with her feelings toward her biotechnical engineering and with those responsible.  Preuss spends a good deal of time wrapping up a lot of loose ends from the fouth book.  But, he also delves back into the plot of the entire series, reminding the reader why s/he finished the last book.  The reader is pulled back into the mystery and intrigue of the alien culture called Culture X.  We have reached the fuzzy edge of knowledge that will hopefully crystalize in the last book.	2005-07-27

Sparta is a biologically enhanced woman who is on a personal mission to find her parents or the man who killed them.  In order to do this she takes on a new identity, Ellen Troy, and rises to the rank of investigator in the Board of Space Control.  With the help of her childhood friend, Blake Redfield, she begins to unravel the mysteries behind her biological enhancements and the group that calls themselves the Free Spirits. <br /> <br />In this second volume, Preuss does an excellent job of continuing the suspense and drama that made the first book so intriguing.  Not only does each book hold a mystery in and of itself, but the series as a whole is a mystery in which the reader picks up clues along the way.  Quite an interesting concept that I've not seen in the mystery/suspense genre.  However, this technique does seem to lend itself to sci-fi where the reader is used to stories that continue past a single book.	2005-07-13

I think Preuss was trying to setup alot of the series story arc in this book, but it just made for an extremely boring read.  I actually feel asleep about midway through the book and it took me at least a week before I wanted to pick it back up.  Unlike the other books this one does not work as a stand alone, too much information regarding Sparta's and Blakes's pasts is necessary to understand the plot twists and conspiracy theories that run throughout this book. <br /> <br />I only recommend this book if you've read the previous three books in the series.	2005-07-13

I'm going to skip the plot synopsis, because you can read it elsewhere.  What I will say is that by the third book in this series the format seems to get a bit repeatative.  Sparta, a.k.a. Ellen Troy, works for the Board of Space Control and is sent to yet another planet/satellite to solve yet another crime that, while on the surface may seem unrelated, are actually connected by a secret group of people who are also connected to her biological enhancements.  She's been to Venus and the Moon and now she visits Mars.  I'm beginning to think Preuss is simply attempting a tour of the solar system. <br /> <br />Preuss' writing still seems to hold up throughout the book and I was still eager to find out how this one wrapped up.  However, the overall mystery of the series is being drawn out a little too much.  I think this could have been wrapped up nicely in three rather than six books.	2005-07-13

I really wish I had read it sooner.  The first third to half of the book jumps from one storyline to another.  If you can get past the disjointed beginning, the different storylines quickly come together and make sense.  I've read some complaints about this, but I find these techniques interesting.   <br /> <br />Preuss does an excellent job of combining science fiction and mystery/thriller.  I used to read a lot of mystery books, but quickly tired of the genre.  This was a refreshing read in that it wasn't predictible as a mystery or science fiction novel. <br /> <br />Ellen Troy, aka Sparta, was enhanced with biotechnology when she was younger and something happened to her that caused her to forget everything that has happend in the past few years.  Troy decides to join the Space Board of Control in order to find out what happened to her.  Along the way she has to figure out what caused a hole in a spaceship headed to Venus.	2005-06-27

Aahz is transported back to his home dimension, Perv, and Skeeve is left to handle his job as court magician on his own.  He soon ends up with a homicidal queen, Hemlock, and the Mob's fairy godfather, Bruce, after him.    Hit or Myth is just as entertaining as the previous books in this series.  Even though Aahz was out of the story for most of the book, the storyline continued to work.  It allowed the reader and Aahz to realize how far Skeeve has come in his apprenticeship.  It was nice to see Skeeve develop throughout the book from an apprentice to a magician in his own rite.	2005-06-22

In this tale of myth-adventure, Skeeve gets a job, with the aide of his mentor Aahz, as a court magician .  Unfortunately, they get more than they bargained for; part of their job is to protect the kingdom's northern border from the invading Empire.  When all hope is nearly lost, they return to the Bazaar at Deva and hire their own rag-tag army. <br /> <br />This is the second book in Asprin's Myth series; the first is Another Fine Myth.  Each book in the series can be read as a stand-alone, but onch you read one you'll be hooked.  The only thing I have to complain about is Asprin's over-use of details from the previous book in order to \\"catch-up\\" a new reader to the series.  If you have already read the previous book, it can be a bit tedious.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone, whether or not you read fantasy.  Asprin puts forth a great deal of effort to concentrate on character development and their relationships, and succeeds in writing an enjoyable and light-hearted story that just happens to have creatures from different dimensions.	2005-06-22

I still laughed, but not quite as much. However, I did notice more of the humor this time around. <br /> <br />The Myth series is a breathe of fresh air in the fantasy genre, even if it is over 20 years old. Asprin writes witty dialogue with a cast of characters you can't help but feel a part of. <br /> <br />Skeeve is an apprentice magician and his master is murdered. Aahz is a magician from another dimension that has lost his powers. The two work together to find the man that hired the assassin and seek revenge. Along the way Murphy's Law seems to be the only constant. This is the first in a long line of fun and interesting adventures for the two. It's not necessary to read them in order, but this one will give you some background info. I highly recommend this series if you are looking for laughs and a good fantasy adventure.	2005-06-19

I've been toying with the notion of reading a lesbian romance for a couple years, but none of the book descriptions sounded interesting enough to hold my attention.  I ran across this one and was intrigued since I too suffer from depression and understand the 'sexual dysfunction' effect of medications. <br /> <br />I have to say that Herring did a decent, maybe even good, job of describing the confusion of suffering from depression.  Granted, we only see and hear Betina's suffering from her partner's point-of-view, Maxine.  I believe a much better piece of general fiction could be written by focusing on Betina's point-of-view through the progression of this disease.  The only other complaint I have is the excessive amount of surgical procedures Maxine performed, mostly hystorectomies.   <br /> <br />These two, minor, complaints aside, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed reading White Lace.  There was a good balance between storyline and not-quite-gratuitous sex scenes.  I'm willing to give lesbian romances a second shot.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for a romance with a REAL storyline and real characters.	2005-06-10

However, it was just as good, if not better.  Affinity is a gothic tale of a 'spinster,' Margaret, that visits female prisoners.   <br /> <br />Margaret went through a depression after her father passed away a couple years ago.  She decides to spend time with the female prisoners on weekly basis in order to get herself out of the house and improve her mood.  She finds a mysterious prisoner, Selina, there and begins visiting her every week.  Selina is a spirit-medium and slowly begins opening up to Margaret.  I'd say more, but I don't want to spoil it. <br /> <br />Waters has created a story that weaves the reader in, out and around and leaves them at the edge of their seats until the last couple pages.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys edge-of-your-seat gothic suspense.  To everyone else, I still recommend it.	2005-05-17

Cadigan created truly believable characters.  She showed that whether a person is \\"good\\" or \\"bad,\\" that person is still human and has flaws.  It was nice to see fictional, genius computer hackers with flaws.  Today's culture seems to have a too high percentage of fictional computer hackers that are god-like perfect. <br /> <br />Cadigan also created a story that, while not impossible to put down, compels the reader to continue.  She draws the reader in, shows them the pros and cons to a new technology, and leaves the rest to the reader, allowing the reader to decide its worth. <br /> <br />Even though the book has universal themes, I wouldn't recommend this to others that didn't read sci-fi.  If you like sci-fi I would recommend giving this book a try.  Keep in mind though that Cadigan doesn't give a thoroughly convincing argument to the technology's validity; I'm not sure that was her main focus.	2005-04-25

The first was Hocus Pocus. I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as Hocus Pocus, but it was still good. I really enjoy Vonnegut's writing style. He seems to scrap together bits and pieces of a story into a seamless and enjoyable read. <br /> <br />For a novel about war, it was quite comical even though I would still rank it up there with All Quiet on the Western Front and Hiroshima. Vonnegut shows the ugly side of war and how it effects those that survive. If you enjoy war novels, this one is a little off the beaten path but still worth the time.	2005-04-02

This is the first book in the Honor Harrington series and if it's any indication of the rest of the series, I'm ready!    Honor receives her first command in the Royal Majesty's Navy, but she and her crew are cast off to the outskirts of the Kingdom. To make matters worse, a personal enemy from her past abandons her and leaves the crew as a single ship to do the job of a small fleet.    Weber's creation of Honor is magnificent and his writing not only creates a page-turner, but you actually feel as though you are part of the action. All of the characters are well developed with personalities that you can really get to know as if you were part of the crew. The action scenes are well written and you can visualize the scenes as if you were watching a movie. The over all layout of the book makes for a smooth and easy read. I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys military sci-fi.    On a side note, I enjoyed reading a sci-fi novel with a good percentage of female characters, especially in higher ranking offices. Definitately a nice change of pace.	2005-03-30

Was I ever surprised. <br /> <br />I don't agree with most of the other reviewers in that it started out slow. I was immediately sucked in and really wish that I had started it early on a Saturday morning so that I could've just plowed through it. <br /> <br />Pi's (Martel's) narration constantly makes you wonder what is going to happen next. The only thing you know is that he lives. He makes you realize how small we are on this planet and that life exists and goes on outside of the bubble in which we each live. I highly recommend this to everyone.	2005-03-01

This book is somewhat dry, but does present alot of information and data concerning the digital divide in countries all over the world. For those unfamiliar with what the digital divide is, it is the lack of \\"information and communication technology\\" in developing countries and in underprivedged sections of developed countries. <br /> <br />Warschauer does a good job of presenting the problems and probable causes. He then presents many different types of solutions that have been attempted, their successes and failures, and why they either worked or not. He finally discusses why we should now view this problem as a digital inequality instead of a digital divide. <br /> <br />If you are unfamiliar with this topic, I believe this would be a good breadth-type introduction.	2005-02-22

Cerise and her ex-lover, Trouble, have to team up in order to stop a copycat hacker from tarnishing Trouble's name. Scott touches on the aspects of new technology, how an older generation can be reluctant to accept it and the problems that can stem from that reluctance and from the new technology itself. The book is somewhat difficult to get into at first, but it quickly comes together and turns into a great page turner.	2005-02-22

The book focuses on the results of a \\"four-year study (involving some 230 interviews) at Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.\\" The authors did not spend a great deal of time offering solutions to the gender gap problem, but they did offer a great deal of insight into what causes it, such as the way boys and girls play and subsequently view the computer as a \\"boy's toy.\\" It goes into detail about the societal pressures and our cultural differences that have attributed to the small percentage of women in computer science. I believe that some of the results from this research can lead to programs and other solutions that will eventually decrease the gender gap, but again not much emphasis is placed on what these solutions might be. <br /> <br />On a personal note, it was actually quite helpful in sorting out the emotions and situations that occured during my undergrad work and the fears and apprehensions I had of going to grad school. I especially recommend this book to all women in the computer fields and any woman interested in pursuing a computer science career.	2005-02-22

While it was interesting, I felt that it gets bogged down from time to time. There were times I wanted to feel sorry for this group of family members, but just couldn't for one reason or another. I think I mostly didn't like the main character's belief that he and his younger brother deserved certain things and were better than everyone else. However, the author did leave the characters emotionally vulnerable from time to time, which brought back some humanity. <br /> <br />If you like to read about a character that falls into the perverbial outhouse and comes out smelling like roses, then I highly recommend it. Otherwise, I don't think it lived up to all the hype.	2004-09-26

Phule is similar to Sgt. Bilko, but in outer space.  If you like the Myth serious this is a good book to  try.  Asprin keeps the humor going throughout the book much like his Myth  books.  I definitly recommend this to anyone looking for a good laugh that  could last a few hours.	1999-12-21
