The Whole purpose of their research which lasted  for a good Number of years was to discover what certain behaviors on the  salesman's part helped In creating a successful purchase in the  Major-Account sale, in which the item for Sale was usually expensive and  requires a long after-sales relationship between buyer And seller.<br />Mr.  Rackham turns the conventional sales knowledge upside-down and he does so   very convincingly. He divides the sale into 4 phases; The Preliminaries,  Investigating, Demonstrating Capability and Obtaining Commitment. He lays  great emphasis in The Investigation phase, and it is in this phase that the  SPIN Model comes into action.<br />SPIN is an acronym for the different types  of questions that a seller must use in order to properly establish the last  two phases of the sales call. Situation questions are simple  straightforward questions about the buyer's company and current situation  they are general questions that basically aim to establish context for the  next questions. Problem questions are those which aim to pinpoint the exact  problems of the buyer so that it becomes easier to uncover his implied  needs. Implication questions take us a step further into examining the  consequences of the buyers problem more closely and trying to make him more  acutely aware of  their ramifications so that we can start asking  Need-Payoff questions which basically deal with the value and utility that  the buyer perceives in a solution. The Need-Payoff questions lead to the  development of Explicit need in which the buyer Has been led to clearly  understand the context of his exact need to fix a particular Problem. Only  after the SPIN questions have been successfully used to define Those  explicit needs can a seller start demonstrating capability. With knowledge  Of the needs of the buyer the seller can therefore more easily demonstrate  solutions Which satisfy those explicit needs, i.e. the benefits of the  product or service.<br />Mr. Rackham describes the different phase in the  different chapters of his book and provides very useful information to  discredit many misconceptions that have long Been held holy by salesmen,  such as the importance of closing, the true meaning of Benefit as opposed  to advantage and feature, the relative value of openings and first  Impressions and most of all the value of the investigating phase.<br />An  Essential book if you have anything to do with Sales.	2000-09-06

Politics is generally way beyond the scope of my field of interest. I did,  however, buy the book and I did enjoy it.<br />For someone of very little  political background as myself, I found the book very easy to read and even  gripping in parts. (you must bear in mind that gripping me by the  happenings in Somalia is a superior achievement of a very able  author.)<br />Mr. Ghali's writing style is awesome. He makes the complex  simple and does so with such grace that reading the book becomes a  recreational activity rather than a study of contemporary political  events.<br />The book reveals a lot of the &quot;happenings&quot; in the  international political scene and points at many &quot;obstacles&quot; that  the UN has encountered and describes why he was not re-elected for a  &quot;generally given&quot; second term.<br />The book is divided into 8  chapters. Each describes a particular event or string of events that happen  during a defined period of time from 1991 till 1996.<br />An enjoyable book.  Dr. Ghali takes you by the hand on a tour around the world as the UN saw it  in those 5 years.<br />Essentail reading for Statesmen. Enjoyable reading for  others.	2000-07-08

Ogilvy on Advertising is the book that deserves that title when it comes to solid techniques and guidlines. The Wizards of Ads however goes way beyond  technique to human nature and service factors; it is more of a  structureless marketing book than it is an advertising book. You will not  find any principles of design or definitions of Reach here, but you will  definitely find a lot of wisdom.<br />The Book is divided into 100 + 1  chapters and is about 200 pages long. Which means that each chapter  averages 2 pages. I could read 2 chapters between meetings. The last  chapter being an epic on service, not advertising but plain service, plain  ownership of responsibilty for your job. &quot;A message to Garcia&quot; I  passed copies of it to my clients and associates.<br />I was very interested  in this book when I started reading it. I am currently reading 4 different  books, the reviews for which will appear soon (Focus, Unvanquished, Spin  Selling, &amp; Management Challenges of the 21st century) - I received The  Wizard while reading the first 3 of the above mentioned books, of course it  occupied all my reading time for 2 days and was finished before any of  them.<br />You will definitly enjoy this book.

Yet the book was full of lessons in a variety of  business fields; entrepreneurship and risk-taking being at the forefront of  those fields. In its value as a business book, I would compare it to  &quot;Lessons from the Top&quot; and &quot;The Millionnaire Next  Door&quot;, both of which were a much less gripping read. However,  &quot;Losing my Virginity&quot; is different from those two books in that  it is primarily about &quot;World Class Entrepreneurship&quot;.<br />Branson  takes the reader on a trip back to the 60's and 70's when Virgin took off  and gradually leads you into the &quot;jetstream&quot; of his turbulant  life. You will enjoy the ride.<br />This is definitely a book that I  thoroughly enjoyed and earnestly recommend to anyone, not necessarily to  businessmen, just to anyone who wants to make the most of his/her  life.<br />Richard Branson used the book well on many occasions to tell his  side of the story and to clarify to the public certain events that may have  not been fully disclosed in that way during the time of their  occurance.<br />He also talks freely about matters, which a conventionial  bussinessman would find out of place, beyong the point or even downright  embarrassing. Those &quot;personal&quot; moments are actually the essence  of what this book is all about. The book is about Branson's life and Virgin  Group is just that, a very large chunk of Branson's life.	2000-05-01

Whether you are having serious trouble with life and are truly ineffective or whether you seek more effectiveness  in your successful life; this book will benefit you.<br />The Seven Habits are  easy to understand and are applicable in a host of life situations. The  book DOES, however, require a certain (normal) degree of imagination and  intellect, as it does go into deep issues that are difficult to fathom by  people who have seriously underdeveloped conscience, imagination and/or  self-awareness; the principles are also difficult to apply by those who  lack Will.<br />I liked the book, it took more than the average time to read,  but it was worth it. I strongly recommend it.<br />I also recommend (for  different paradigms) Life Strategies by Phil McGraw, The Prince by Niccollo  Machiavelli and Lincoln on Leadership by Donald Philips. You can find  reviews on all these books in my members page.	2000-04-12

The whole methodology depends on observation, thorough observation; which is later subjected to  analysis and from that analysis they come up with valuable conclusions and  suggestions for their clients.<br />The book does, however, contain parts in  which Mr. Underhill wanders off his area of expertise and starts projecting  into the future without solid basis; therby losing some credibilty.<br />It  also seems that Mr. Underhill is not well versed on Marketing and I quote  from Page 206, &quot;But since the early '80s, PoP has really become a  player, &amp; now commands a seat at the selling table right next to  marketing's&quot;, Any apprentice of marketing knows that PoP (point of  purchase) is one of the many sales promotional tools that are only one part  of Marketing Communications which is but one of 6 main categories of tools  at the marketer's disposal. In actuality, PoP does in fact have a chair on  the Marketing Table along with many other tools, such as the internet. I  think Mr. Underhill shares a common misconception held by many  non-marketers that marketing = advertising; while in fact advertising is  still only a tool and only part of Marketing communications just like Sales  Promotion is.<br />The book is full of useful and insightful retail  information. The essence of the book is how to keep the customer in the  store longer, at a greater level of comfort and easy navigation.<br />Mr.  Underhill is backed with years of observation and study of how a shopper  interacts with the retail environment; an essential read for anyone in  retailing and FMCG brand management.<br />A great reference book.	2000-01-08

This book, &quot;How to enjoy yor life&quot;, is a selection of chapters from the abovementioned book and from &quot;How to  stop worrying and start living&quot;. Dale Carnegie's style is very simple  and he conveys a deep understanding of human nature. The book was easy to  read and hosted a large number of ideas on how to lead a more effective  life; none of the ideas are revolutionary, they are simply common sense  practices that we fail to implement on a daily basis.	1999-12-02
US	50673498	R2SGDU8T1HJUHT	0671015206	826470409	The Millionaire Next Door	Books	5	9	9	N	N	EyeOpener	This Book makes perfect sense. It makes the reader understand a very important point; wealth = net worth, rather than income or social image. Studded with research results and actual life stories it highlights the  means, benefits and definition of financial independance. It has helped  enlighten and transform my thinking. Well Done Drs. Danko and Stanley.	1999-12-01

This book however was not put down until finished and no other book shared my reading time during that period.  Enjoy it and learn from the life of one of the greatest leaders the world  has known. The writing style makes you feel that you are actually there  during the civil war, contemplating with Abe how to handle a particular  situation.	1999-11-30

Books	5	9	13	N	N	Common Sense is What Marketing is All About	This book is very simple and easy to read and very clearly lists 22 laws which have made many brands successful in this past century. This is not text-book marketing , it is observational marketing which is really the  essence of our profession. Marketing will never be a science; because we  deal with a variable that is totally unpredicatable, completely insatiable  and everchanging - I am talking of the human mind. Marketing is also not an  Art. Marketing is a discipline of observation and execution that requires a  mixture of a solid scientific and a dreamy artistic mind.	1999-11-30

I agree fully with all the life laws, they are the basics of human improvement. I do, however, think that Dr. McGraw's style is a little  too intimidating and I did lend the book to someone who got either  depressed or frightened on numerous occasions throughout the book. If you  are strong and willing to change your life to a more effective, more  productive one, read this book.	1999-11-30

He combines his knowledge and passion with strict guidlines which he has learned and accepted and that are still applicable today. I had  borrowed the book from a previous employer when I first started working in  Advertising, as soon as I could I bought my own copy and have read the book  thrice so far; I am currently summarizing it for future reference.	1999-11-30
