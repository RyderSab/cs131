Sadly, if those days ever existed, they're long gone (e.g., Farenheit 911 on the Left, Rush Limbaugh on the Right), so I doubt that Mr. Rogan's book will be read by those who don't share his political views (with the notable exception of Willie Brown).<br />That's a shame, because Mr. Rogan's rags-to-riches / 'Horatio Alger' story is a refreshing counter-example to two prep school / Ivy Leaguers battling over who supposedly has the best interest of ordinary Americans in mind and the recent celebration of hyper-privileged spoiled rich brats (e.g., Paris Hilton, et al.) that has polluted popular culture. James Rogan had a hardscrabble upbringing - single mother who was what many of his Republican colleagues would have called a 'welfare queen,' bounced around various relatives, growing up in what was then a rough neighborhood, and hanging out with a motley crew of characters that wouldn't be welcomed in the thousands of dollars a plate or seat fundraising event for either party. Inspired to go to school and pull himself up by the bootstraps by none other than Bill Clinton (yes, the ex-President), he went to a state school with the highest representation of working class/poor students among major universities, UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles).<br />Ironically -- or appropriately (depending on what political movement you believe best represents the interests and aspirations of those who hover around the lower middle class) -- James Rogan became a conservative Republican congressman who went on to help prosecute Bill Clinton during the impeachment proceedings. The road to that role as a prosecutor was paved with his work in the Los Angeles D.A.'s office prosecuting notorious street gangs like the Bloods and the Crips.<br />The impeachment of Clinton proved to be a phyrric victory for Rogan. His 'success' made him the target of the vast left wing conspiracy (if Bill and Hillary can make paranoid claims without much challenge, I suppose the James Rogans of the world are entitled to as well) and he was voted out of office. [By the way, Rogan's congressional district includes Glendale, CA. I did NOT vote for him (I was living in the East Coast during most of his tenure, and moved here after Rogan was voted out of office.)]<br />I'm NOT a Republican. I did not think that impeaching Clinton was a great idea. But having said all of that, Rogan's story is so interesting, thought-provoking, and (yes this description will be repeated for the umpteenth time) inspirational that people should put down their particular political/policy prejudices and just enjoy this uniquely American biography. I wish people like James Rogan -- of either political party -- were running for President and offering Americans a REAL choice instead of having to choose a President that will be a rich White Bonesman from Yale -- who will never know what it's like to scrap for everything you got like the James Rogans of the world have to do -- no matter who winds up winning.	2004-07-15

I think they are totally unfair.<br />A lot of the criticism of this book is by people who claim to be disgruntled investors who lost big in the stock market. They seem to be taking it out on former SEC chairman Levitt. They are dead wrong! <br />Arthur Levitt championed the cause of small investors. He championed investors' rights against tough opposition from the Big 5 (now Big 4 sans Andersen) accounting firms, some (but not all) Wall Street financiers, etc. Levitt stuck to his principles in spite of tremendous opposition, personal insults, and threats to the SEC. The ONLY reason he lost in his attempts to defend small investors was because some members of Congress were bought off by Levitt's (and investors') enemies. This isn't just something that Levitt believes; almost everyone who has followed the issue on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill (EVEN Levitt's enemies) ALL agree that the above were the facts. In spite of the opposition, Levitt did manage to get some issues on the table (Reg FD - 'Fair Disclosure' - and trying to make accounting for derivatives as well as the co-habitation between accountants & consultants issues for public debate). All of that was accomplished by Levitt even when some in Congress threatened to cut the funding to the SEC.<br />Mr. Levitt's book recounts his heroic efforts, in the face of fierce opposition, to reform a flawed system. His book should be applauded for those reasons alone! On top of that, Mr. Levitt offers some sound advice to investors that would have helped to prevent many of those who have lost their shirts (and foolishly bash Levitt's book) from getting fooled into bad investment decisions.<br />Do I think Levitt's book is perfect or all that it claims to be? No. But if people are going to bash a book, they better back it up with facts and review a book in a thoughtful and logical manner rather than getting the facts wrong, lying, and/or going off into a world of their own. <br />Bottom-line: If you want the truth about Wall Street and politics, Levitt's book is a great read. If you want to criticize this book AFTER you actually read it, then please do so in a honest, factual, and logical manner rather than in a dishonest and irrational manner as some of the other reviewers have (unfortunately and unfairly) done.<br />Edit (11/17/02): I whole-heartedly agree with the review by Phillip Brown (Pennsylvania, .... Note (11/20/02): Apparently the rest of my edited review was deleted by Amazon thus making me look bad. Which begs the question: Why aren't they similarly editing out the 1-star reviews of this book that are clearly slanderous? I'm actually doing Amazon a favor by making sure that accurate, fair, and positive info about this book gets out there which will lead to more sales for them. The looney 1-star reviews would lead to poorer sales. So what gives?	2002-10-19

I wanted to echo Charles Ashbacher's positive and fairminded review of this book (and counter the hostile and unfair review by the first reviewer). This book by Marcel Danesi is designed to provide people with an accessible way to approach logic puzzles (as Ashbacher pointed out, there is a good deal of *mathematical* puzzles as well but they do not require a great deal of math background). If -- as the negative reviewer argued -- this book is on a introductory level, so much the better! There are a lot of people who would like to and should get into logic puzzles and games.<br />This book is a great way to avoid some of the pitfalls and intimidating obstacles faced by puzzle-solvers -- whether you are a novice or an *expert.*<br />As for the comments made by the 1st reviewer ... it really is unfair to bash this book based on some sort of egotistical grounds as that particular reviwer seems to be doing. If this book is mostly for *beginners* -- and I believe, on the contrary, that it would be great for puzzle enthusiasts as well -- then there is absolutely nothing wrong with that! Everyone needs to be able to walk before they can run and if beginners get a taste for puzzle-solving from a book like this and go on to harder puzzles, then great for them! Frankly, in this world today, we need to encourage more people to get into logic rather than discourage people by the kinds of arrogant attitudes displayed by the 1st reviewer.<br />Also recommended: *Problem Solving Through Recreational Mathematics* by Averbach &amp; Chein, *Puzzles for Pleasure* by Barry Clarke, *Mensa Logic Brainteasers*, and Marcel Danesi's new book *The Puzzle Instinct* (which not only provides puzzles but also discusses puzzles from an anthropological perspective ... i.e., how puzzles are a part of various important themes in human culture throughout recorded history).	2002-08-30

Although this book is a companion to G &amp; S's 3rd edition of *Probability and Random Processes,* the authors strove to make the *Exercises* book stand on its own.<br />The 2 previous reviewers took a widely different view of this book. I wanted to have a balanced approach to reviewing this book. I hope this helps.<br />-- This book has exercises that cover a wide range of topics in probability. It starts from basic issues in probability and eventually covers topics like queueing, Monte Carlo (&amp; Markov Chain Monte Carlo), Ito's lemma &amp; financial option valuation, etc. Any one vaguely interested in probability realizes that the topics covered by Grimmett &amp; Stirzaker are *hot topics* and very useful to those who want to try to get a sense of how important probability theory is in real life. I can't think of a comparable book that is so ambitious and covers so much useful ground in one place. [At least not one with answers to every question.]<br />-- I am not personally familiar with Grimmett's work (I believe he is at Cambridge University). I am, however, familiar with Strizaker's work (he is at Oxford). I consider him to be one of the finest expositers of probability theory. Stirzaker's views on probability theory (which I read in a different work) is one of the most lucid and sensible I have ever come across. Anyone seriously interested in probability should try to get exposure to Stirzaker's thoughts on the matter.<br />-- I believe this book is GREAT for self-study. One of the major problems I have with many math, science, engineering, and other technical books is that -- even very good books -- do not provide answers/solutions to the questions they pose. As someone who is very interested in self-study, I find a book like this one -- which has the answers/solutions to ALL of the questons -- to be extremely refreshing and welcomed.<br />To address the prior criticism that this book does not contain a sufficient amount of detail in the solutions .... I would suggest that such a criticism is unfair. As I pointed out above (and most people know) it is very rare to have technical books like this where there are a great deal of interesting and useful exercises given plus answers/solutions to all of the questions posed. For 2 emminent Oxbridge dons to write such a book is even more exciting.<br />In all fairness, Grimmett &amp; Stirzaker wrote this book with the intent that it be used along with an appropriate probability textbook(s). Any one willing to take the time to look at the solutions given along with a companion text should be able to work out what went wrong (or right) with any question that the reader attempts to work out.<br />In closing, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in going from a novice level at probability to a point where you can approach and solve useful problems in probability.	2002-08-28

However, this is because there is a companion book -- *One Thousand Exercises in Probability* (2nd ed.) -- that is designed to provide those examples and exercises. That book contains the answers/solutions to each and every exercise posed in that book. That book also closely follows the topics of this book. Together, those 2 books by Grimmett &amp; Stirzaker should meet all of the requirements for self-studiers of probability theory. [Really, the 2 books should be seen as a set.]<br />(2) The 3rd edition of this book (along with exercises/answer book) cover a wide range of topics from probability starting from basics and going up to applications like queueing, Monte Carlo &amp; Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Ito's Lemma &amp; financial option valuation, etc. In short, this set of books should enable the sufficiently motivated to go from basic probability to a point where they can approach useful problems in applied probability (rather than toy problems offered by other books which, by the way, don't usually give the answers).<br />(3) Stirzaker (Oxford) has one of the best approaches to thinking about probability that I have ever come across. It is well worth it to expose oneself to his viewpoint.	2002-08-28

One of von Hippel's key arguments in this book -- as well as in subsequent research and publications -- is that a lot of innovation comes from users of products and services. As users find new uses or new needs for products and services, producers often innovate to meet those needs. While that may seem obvious, this book was one of the first works to verify it in a scientific and rigorous way. Much more surprising than the conclusion just presented is how von Hippel found that users themselves often made the modifications or created new products and processes that lead to innovation. This book belongs in the library of anyone interested in innovation: scientists, engineers, economists, and businesspeople.	2001-12-12

The level of math ranges from advanced high school to college level math, but the level is not really important ... what is important is the insights one can get from looking at common mathematical mistakes.<br />This book may also be of interest to neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and psychologists who are interested in how human beings learn and apply mathematics. On a somewhat related note, I have noticed that (for some strange reason) this book has attracted a set of rather bizarre reviewers (see below).

On that level, this book scores a solid 5 stars (especially since there is nothing like this book out there). For some strange reason people have gotten the impression that this book should be filled with 'war stories' of VCs and entreprenuers, sayings of business gurus, and other back-slapping, feel good cliches instead of rigourous scientific evidence. When these people find themselves disappointed (despite the obvious fact that this is a research oriented book) they accuse this book of being &quot;not practical&quot; or being only for eggheads. While it is true that this book is not going to be full of bar room banter about how one can get rich quick, keep in mind the fact that most VCs and entrepreneurs are in the business of sophisticated and highly technical ideas. If VCs and entrepreneurs have a great deal of intellectual sophistication, wouldn't they find a book full of empirical and deductive evidence about their field be interesting and possibly valuable?

The authors suceed brilliantly in those goals. Most people with limited training in economics and mathematics should be able to understand the book (so, for example, this book would be great for early undergraduates or MBA students who have not been exposed to finance or economics). <br />I think there is enough information in this book to be of some use to even people who have more advanced training. Why? This book gives a good overview of both the theoretical (deductive proofs) and empirical (econometric) research that has been done on various topics (relatively up to date). The book tries to give a balanced view of the merits or problematics of any particular theory in financial economics.<br />This book deserves a 5 star rating rather than a 4 star one because for what it was intended to be -- a solid introduction and overview -- it does a superb job. It would be unfair to judge any book by some unintended higher standard when it does a great job at doing what it intended to do. Bottom line: If you need a good introduction to financial economics, this is a good place to start.	2001-12-06

While it has its rough spots, the book has many good features. One of the really good features of this book is presenting the material with an emphasis on model building ... a very important emphasis that is too often ignored in other econometrics texts.

But there are situations when having the background knowledge is crucial.<br />This book does an excellent job of facilitating self-study of the math underpinning multivariate statistical analysis ... namely, linear (matrix) algebra and some calculus. Each chapter has a set of questions and ALL of the answers are provided in the book (handy for self-study). The one slight critique of this book I can give is that I wish the book did more on the calculus aspects.

This is a great book for beginners as well as for, contrary to the opinions of some of the other reviews, more advanced SAS users/programmers.

Despite having access to massive tomes on SAS, I almost ALWAYS turn to the Little SAS Book, 2nd ed., when I start programming. Let me put it another way: If I was stranded on a desert island and, for some bizarre reason needed to do SAS programming, had to take along one book on SAS, I would choose the Little SAS Book over any of the bigger manuals and books on SAS.<br />By the way, while this book has not been updated since 1996, from my experience, it still works very well with the latest SAS version (ver. 8).

It has a rare combination of being accessible to layman without insulting anyone's intelligence (no pun intended). Another advantage of this book, as well as Oxford's VSI series, is that it the book is slim (in size) and can be carried around and read in a few sittings. That does not mean, however, that the book lacks substance (as one might fear would be the case for short intro books on a difficult subject). Quite the contrary. I would dare say that reading the book would allow even a layman to have an intelligent conversation with an expert on psychometrics.<br />The book has an objective and friendly tone. The author makes his own opinions known but does present contrary opinions and does not offer his own opinions without evidence.

I gather that it is designed for the intellectually curious layman who always meant to learn more about a certain subject but, due to the stresses of life, never managed to do so.<br />This book does an excellent job in accomplishing those goals (and more) with regards to to topic of Logic. This books gives an excellent overview of various issues in (formal) logic. There are several things that I found particularly good about this book:<br />(1) Many people may be scared off by formal logic by the symbolism and mathematical nature of the subject. Graham Priest does an excellent job in guiding the readers through those potential barriers.<br />(2) Conversely, intellectually curious people don't want to be reading a book that is too 'dumbed down.' This book doesn't insult anyone's intelligence. Symbolic logic is presented to the reader but the book is well written enough so that people who tend to glaze over mathematical symbols will still have a good understanding of what is going on (with some effort, of course).<br />(3) I really like the fact that Graham Priest gives a few short problems at the end of each chapter (and provides the solutions on the Oxford UP web site). This not only helps in re-assuring readers that they understood (or did not understand) particular topics but also gives even a total layman an opportunity to apply skills in formal logic. Many books of this type, unfortunately, do not provide self-study questions with answers. It's worth 10 stars that this author did provide such a learning tool.<br />(4) I like the fact that the book tackles probabilistic logic. This topic can be difficult but is often very useful in everyday life (decisionmaking, understanding medical research, etc.).<br />Bottom line: If you always wanted to learn formal logic and were too busy or too scared to try, buy this excellent book.<br />By the way, to give this book a rating of anything less than 5 stars is a grave injustice in my opinion and reasons offered by others for not giving this book a perfect mark are not worthy of consideration	2001-12-04

(even if you don't care about Jai-Alai)	This book gives an accessible account of how a Computer Science professor (with too much time on his hands?) decided to try to come up with a winning system for betting on Jai-Alai. While this book will peek a reader's interest in Jai-Alai, the real genius of this book is how it ties together computer science, probability, statistics, other topics in mathematics, the Internet, computer security, and little bits of physics, economics and finance, together via the use of real-life application: a computerized Jai-Alai betting system.<br />If you are a novice in any one of those fields mentioned, you will love this book. Prof Skiena gives a highly readable and amusing account of his experiences and how they relate to computer science, probability, etc. This books gives an excellent introduction and overview of the various topics mentioned above.<br />If you are experienced in any one of the fields mentioned you will also love this book. For example, this is a great way for a computer science or math student to see how their classroom learning can be applied in the 'real-world.'<br />Bottom-line: I LOVE THIS BOOK!	2001-12-04

It has a nice balance between theory and practice. The Copeland and Antikarov book has way too many errors to live up to the hype of being a useful &quot;practitioner's guide.&quot; People with financial or quantitative backgrounds should be able to utilize Prof. Trigeorgis' book for practical valuation applications.	2001-08-02

The amount of errors and the types of errors this book contains is unacceptable. If the quantity and quality of the errors weren't bad enough, the explanations (if you can call them that) are confusing or incomplete. This book also has many omissions (parts that the authors promise will be included in parts of the book are MISSING!!!). It would be extremely difficult to use this book as a practical guide to real options with all of its errors, omissions, and confusions.<br />I can safely say that I have NEVER read any book with this MANY errors and omissions ... and I have read quite a lot of books on finance, economics, and math.<br />By the way, I and other readers do NOT pay full price so that they can get a \\"rough draft.\\" Readers pay for the final product and readers can reasonably expect a product of higher quality.	2001-07-31

(see below for helpful hint)	<br /> This has to be the best book on math and science ever (note: I haven't read Simon Singh's Code Book yet). This book will make you fall in love with abstract math ... and you don't even have to be a nerd to feel that way ... although it helps ;) <br /><br />Simon Singh somehow manages to explain difficult techincal concepts in a a step-by-step way that is both accessible WITHOUT being too 'dumbed down.' Most 'laymen's books' on science are too inaccessible, too dumbed down, or too much of both! All I can say to Simon Singh (a guy who studied Physics at Cambridge in the UK) is a very British BRILLIANT!!!<br /><br />One helpful hint though ... for those who really loved this book ... I would recommend going to the amazon web site in the uk, and getting the British version of this book. Why? For some strange reason, the American publishers decided to leave some parts out that were in the British (the original) edition of the book. I think most of the material that was left out dealt with Bertrand Russell (and Whitehead???) as well as some additional insights on the future of mathematics. I highly recommend that option for those who don't want to miss out on what was left out.	2001-07-04

(but DOES have some minor errors)	The 2nd ed. of Financial Modeling by Simon Benninga (of the Wharton School, U Penn) and Benjamin Czaczkes is an EXCELLENT introduction to: (1) applied finance, (2) utilizing Excel as both a learning tool as well as a practical tool for finance, and (3) to some extent, computational finance. I HIGHLY recommend this book.<br /><br />However ... CONTRARY to the the reader from London ... this book DOES have some minor errors (and they are errors even to those who ARE DEFINITELY familiar with Excel and VBA). Most of the errors are dealt with on Prof. Benninga's website ...There are some additional errors ... mostly VBA code in the latter chapters of the book (those chapters are devoted to a VBA tutorial) ... but these errors are relatively easy to debug. At any rate, the VBA code on the accompanying CD-ROM seem to be without error.<br /><br />In spite of that cautionary note, to reiterate, this is an EXCELLENT book for students, academics, and practitioners. I especially found the Excel and VBA tutorial (sans the minor errors already noted) to be useful for teaching, learning, and application.	2001-07-04
