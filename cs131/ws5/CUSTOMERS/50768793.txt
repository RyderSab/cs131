I bought the 1st edition of The Twilight Zone Companion back in high school and was amazed at the amount of information included.  I learned a lot about the show, what went on behind the scenes and aquired a greater appreciation for the genius of Rod Serling and touches on other projects he worked on, including Requium for a Heavyweight and Night Gallery.  There is a brief biography about Serling and information about writers Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson and George Clayton Johnson.  All of them contributed stories, though Twilight Zone was Serling's baby. <br /> <br />The only drawback was the fact the shows Zicree personally didn't like, he didn't spend too much time talking about (his opinions would be less biased on the Twilight Zone boxset commentaries).  Everybody has their favorite and not-so-favorite episode (my list of favorites would include Nick of Time, The Hitchhiker, The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street, The Fugitive, Time Enough at Last, Back There, To Serve Man, A Passage for Trumpet, Night of the Meek, In Praise of Pip, Walking Distance, On Thursday We Leave for Home, Eye of the Beholder, It's a Good Life and Nightmare at 20,000 Feet).  However, it's obvious that Zicree is a passioned fan, as he has obviously spent hours of research to each show.   <br /> <br />The latest edition includes information about Twilight Zone- The Movie (I remember watching that with my sister and the It's a Good Life sequence scared the hell out of both of us!) and the Twilight Zone series from the 1980's (there were some good moments, but without the late great Rod Serling, it wasn't the same).  In addition, the index includes the different actors in the index in the original series.   <br /> <br />The original show includes a long resume of actors including Billy Mumy, Burgess Meredith (he'd become the narrator for the movie version), Agnes Moorehead (she sure looks different without all that black mascara!), Jack Klugman (Oscar Madison), Dick York, Elizabeth Montgomery (both from Bewitched but not featured in the same episode), Art Carney (Ed Norton), Jonathon Harris (Dr Smith), Sterling Holloway, Inger Stevens, Stephen Talbot (Leave It to Beaver), Bill Bixby, Edgar Buchanan, Ann Jilian, Joan Blondell, William Demarest, Ron Howard, Jackie Cooper (fom the Our Gang), Buster Keaton, William Shatner (Captain Kirk), Russell Johnson (the Professor), Richard Deacon, Charles Bronson and many others. <br /> <br />If you're as big a fan as I am of The Twilight Zone, read the signpost up ahead and make your next stop the shopping cart!	2005-05-04

In this series of The Complete Peanuts (1955-56), the Peanuts gang has established themselves as we now know them.  Portions of this volume were used in Good Grief, More Peanuts (a collection of Sunday comics), Good Old Charlie Brown, Snoopy and You're Out of Your Mind, Charlie Brown (another exclusive collection of Suday Peanuts comics), all released on Holt Reinhart and Windsor books.  Lucy has become crabbier and bossier to her kid brother Linus.  When Lucy teaches Linus about the \\"facts of life,\\" Charlie Brown says \\"It'll take 12 years for Linus to unlearn everything Lucy has taught him!\\"  This leads to one of the 1st Peanuts stories where Lucy's inane lectures make Charlie Brown's stomach hurt (and later Linus's!).  There is, however, a soft spot to Lucy, she's infatuated with Schroeder.  But Schroeder loves only Beethoven and can't stand Lucy.  In this volume, Scrhoeder uses the piano as a weapon against Lucy whenever she uses it a headrest for the 1st time (KLUNK!) or just drives him crazy, which is most of the time.  He also won't tolerate Snoopy using his piano as a mini-dancefloor (Bill Melendez and Lee Mendelson used this gag in A Charlie Brown Christmas).  Also used in one of the animated specials is a cartoon featured here where Lucy, fed up with Beethoven, smashes Schroeder's Beethoven bust only for Schroeder to go to his closet and get a new one!  It was also used on GAF viewmasters, a toy many of you probably remember.  Charlie Brown has become more melancholy and \\"wishy washy,\\" as the gang seems to see him.  He often complains he has no friends and has trouble flying a kite or winning a baseball game.  He especially has trouble kicking the football from Lucy (\\"AUUUUUUUGH!\\"  Did we mention that Lucy can be sneaky?).  Linus grows up a little and is seen often with his blanket (Snoopy would often try to steal the blanket, leaving Linus flying in the air) or would sometimes shoot Lucy with his finger pistol (\\"BANG!\\").  Glimpses of the great philosopherLinus would become are already underway here.  Pig Pen, who is featured on the cover here, is still a mess but can also be a great philosopher sometimes (\\"I tried cleaning up, Mom, but couldn't get the dirt off.  I think I've reached the point of no return!\\").  Shermy is rarely seen, as Schroeder has replaced him as Charlie Brown's buddy.  The 2 of them love to argue over which is better, Beethoven or Davey Crockett (Charlie Brown often wears a coonskin cap, in honor of his hero).  It looks like Beethoven won in Charles Schulz's eyes, luckily for Schroeder!  Violet and Patty, once friends of Charlie Brown, have become Lucy's Greek chorus for insults to the \\"blockhead.\\"  When Charlie Brown sees the 2 of them laughing, he thinks they're laughing at him!  \\"Oh, good grief, Charlie Brown!  We weren't even thinking about you!\\"  Then he asks them \\"How come you never think about me?\\"  And then of course, there's Snoopy, a lovable smart-allecky beagle who's often seen standing on his 2 feet, doing impersonations of a rhinocerus, Violet and Lucy, Mickey Mouse and (much to Schroeder's offense) Beethoven.  For Patty, he can be a sad dog or a cheerful dog for Violet (or both at the same time!).  He also could dance like Fred Astaire (much to Lucy's annoyance, but what doesn't bother her?) and once cost the other team a point when he refused to spit out the baseball he caught.  Charlie Brown is often seen saying to his dog in frustration \\"You drive me crazy!\\"  Snoopy also has one accident on the ice and his master (more like humble servant) Charlie Brown has to carry him home (Snoopy thinks to himself \\"When?  When?  When will I ever learn?\\").  Snoopy will probably learn his lesson the day Lucy lets Charlie Brown kick the football!	2005-04-24

In this 2nd volume of The Complete Peanuts, Charles Schulz refines the 1st 8 characters he introduced in the 1st 2 and 1/2 years of Peanuts.  Lucy is a little fussier (she'll be known as crabby later on) and Linus, though still a baby, thinks deep thoughts and is known for sucking his thumb.  Charlie Brown is establishing himself as the wishy-washy \\"loser\\" (he has his 1st Valentine's Day letdown in this volume).  Also, the security blanket is introduced but it's Charlie Brown and Schroeder who endorse it at 1st, not Linus.  Lucy admits she has a crush on Schroeder (the 1st in a series of unrequited love affairs).  Violet and Patty are more or less reduced to 2nd bananas (they'll later be known mainly to repeat all of Lucy's putdowns to Charlie Brown).  They plan a party and decide not to invite either Charlie Brown or Lucy, realizing that \\"inviting some people isn't as much fun as not inviting people.\\"  Schroeder is still a big fan of Beethoven and classical music (he's the catcher for Charlie Brown's team) and pretty much replaces Shermy as Charlie Brown's buddy (Shermy is rarely seen in these cartoons, he's given a crewcut).  2 new characters are introduced but only one of them seems to have \\"staying power\\"- Pig Pen and Charlotte Braun.  Pig Pen is a lovable slob with soot all over his face and clothes.  Charlotte Braun is a loud and obnoxious character, who would later be written out.  Charlie Brown's team always loses and Snoopy's imagination runs wild (though he still walks on all fours and we can't read his thoughts that often).  The term \\"blockhead\\" is introduced here.  In fact, Schroeder is one of the 1st to call him that (but not to his face!).  Lucy's mother disgraces her by writing The Life and Times of a Fussbudget.  The term \\"Great Scott!\\" is used often by Charlie Brown (it would later be replaced with \\"Good Grief!\\").  In 1 cartoon, Violet and Patty announce they will not play Lucy's games, which makes Lucy quite upset.  After a tantrum of kicking and screaming, she agrees \\"All right, then.  Let's play your way.\\"  In another cartoon, she kicks around Patty's doll, Violet's stamp collection, Linus' cookies, Charlie Brown's picture puzzle and Schroeder's piano.  Later, as she's running away from the angry gang, she complains nobody understands her!  She won't let Linus play with her toys but she will let him play with a rubber band.  She later takes it away, though: \\"I didn't mean for you to have THAT much fun with it!\\"  Charlie Brown's pitcher mound is introduced.  Linus stands up for the 1st time, but quickly loses his balance when Lucy rewards him with a cookie.  In a few cartoons, adults appear in the background (particularly in the golfing cartoons).  A lot (but not all) of what wound up in More Peanuts and Good Grief, More Peanuts is featured here.  There is also an interesting introduction by news commentator Walter Cronkite.	2004-11-10

The Beatles Anthology CD releases probably had something to do with this.  Nevertheless, if you're interested in the complete recording sessions, this is the book to read.  It begins with their 1st EMI session in June 1962 (back when Pete Best was still the Beatles' drummer, before Ringo Starr replaced him) and ends in 1970 with the remixing of the Let It Be sessions with Phil Spector.  The only thing that's dated is the often repeated phrase \\"This remains unreleased to this day\\" in reference to songs \\"Leave My Kitten Alone,\\" \\"Not Guilty\\" (the Beatles' version), \\"One After 909\\" (the 1963 version), \\"12 Bar Original,\\" \\"That Means a Lot,\\" \\"What's the New Mary Jane\\" and \\"How Do You Do It.\\"  This book features anecdotes about what went on during the studio sessions (some the Anthology listeners and viewers already know about and more), photographs, interviews and insights by producer George Martin, Norman Smith, engineer Geoff Emerick, session drummer Andy White (who took Ringo's place on the single version of \\"Love Me Do\\") and an insightful interview with Paul McCartney.  Yes, Mark Lewishon has done his homework here with research and hours upon hours of listening to the Beatles' session tapes.  In a perfect world, many of these still unreleased sessions would be available for listening, legally (of course, there would be some tracks which would leave the listener thinking \\"Ok, now I know why they didn't release this\\").  I'd like to see an updated version of this book (many of Mark's comments concerning the songs and other additional tracks mentioned above will have to be replaced with \\"Until the release of The Beatles Anthology 1 [or 2 or 3], this take/track remained unreleased\\").  He'd have to include a section for the Beatles Anthology CD's and DVD collection (\\"You can hear part of this take on Part 1 [or Part 3 or Part 8] of The Beatles Anthology\\").	2004-06-11

Not even the 1st Peanuts book includes all of the cartoons (I have the book and I don't remember it including the 1st cartoon where Shermy introduces Charlie Brown, sarcastically calling him &quot;Good ol' Charlie Brown&quot;).  The 1st 5 characters included Charlie Brown (who started out naive and friendly), Patty (not Peppermint, she was just a cute girl with bobbed hair and a plaid dress and matching hairbow), Shermy (Charlie Brown's original buddy), Violet (known for her pigtails and mudpies) and Snoopy (who walked on all fours whose gags were more cute, not yet ingenious).  The next year (1951) would mark the debut of Schroeder, who started out as a baby and later became a pint-sized musical genius with a passion for Beethoven (you can see the cartoon where Charlie Brown plants the seeds inside the future musical maestro's head).  Violet and Patty would start out as friends to both Charlie Brown and Shermy.  Also, Charlie Brown 1st models his trademarked shirt with the jagged stripe this year.  1952 marks the beginning of the Sunday strip (I believe it's the one they're all playing tag; the trademarked block letters had yet to be introduced).  And of course, we see the debut of the Van Pelt family.  First introduced is Lucy, a cute little girl (seriously) with saucerlike eyes (she'd later sport a fussbudget attitude)and later, her baby brother, Linus (at 1st, he'd fall down a lot in the strip and had yet to be known for his blanket and his philosophy on life).  Classic cartoons include the debut (of course), Charlie Brown getting offended by a rumour of a crush on Patty, Violet reprimanding Snoopy for sitting in the birdbath, the gang playing tag, Lucy mistaking Charlie Brown's record collection for licorice candy and the 1st instance of Charlie Brown getting the football yanked away (1st from Violet, but Lucy would later take on the role eversince).

These were the final words in Peanuts comics delivered by the late Charles Schulz.  To answer the question, you can never forget Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus and Snoopy.<br />I remember the last \\"new\\" comic strip came out 13 February, the day after he died.  Thanks, Sparky, for all the memories and the inspiration (I work on my own cartoon strip).<br />These cartoons were originally published early 1999 through February, 2000 in the newspapers.  Charlie Brown has a date for a dance (something that rarely happened).  Rerun holds the football for Charlie Brown (he got more and more parts in the cartoon strip in the final years).  Charlie Brown pays tribute to the ever scowling Joe Torre!  Cartoonist Day is remembered (5 May).  Snoopy writes more novels and plays golf with the musical notes from Schroder's piano.  \\"Wolves are making a comeback,\\"  as Sally philosophises.  There's also a tribute to painter Andrew Wyeth and Valley Forge, as acted out by Snoopy. Snoopy Claws can be seen downtown around Christmas.    <br />Also, Charlie Brown hits a grand slam, Linus kicks the habit once and for all and gives his blanket to Snoopy, Peppermint Patty gets straight A's, the Great Pumpkin comes as promised and Schroeder finally admits he's got a crush on Lucy!  Don't hold your breath on the last 5, folks!  I was just seeing if you were paying attention!<br />However, this book is poignant since these were the final strips of Peanuts.  Charles Schulz must have known the days of the Peanuts cartoon were numbered when he let Rerun hold the football!  If you're a Peanuts fan, you'll enjoy this book!	2004-03-01

Linus reluctantly takes Sally to play tennis but it ends after Sally tells the big kids off!  Snoopy \\"helps\\" Linus kick the blanket habit but Linus is, naturally, not too appreciative of the approach used.  Charlie Brown and the gang play a game of \\"Ha Ha Herman\\" (sort of a form of hide and seek) and Peppermint Patty denies she has a crush on her \\"Chuck,\\" unknowing that Charlie Brown has heard all! Marcie (after making a cameo under a different name many years ago) is formally introduced and gives Peppermint Patty the nickname \\"Sir.\\" Thus, Peppermint Patty has a new expression: \\"STOP CALLING ME SIR!\\" She also wears a dress for the 1st time after her school enforces a dress code.

Here, Lucy announces she's going to have a \\"crab-in\\" (probably a pun on \\"Laugh-In,\\" then a popular 1960's show).  Peppermint Patty becomes a camp counselor and we see the 1st incarnation of Marcie (she hadn't been given that name yet and you didn't see her refer to Peppermint Patty as \\"sir\\").  Snoopy becomes baseball manager and anyone who makes a mistake or talks back to him gets a swift kick in the pants!  BOOT!  Lucy gives Schroeder a new nickname, \\"Dearheart,\\" and ol' Dearheart threatens to resign as catcher unless Lucy stops calling him that!  She also paints rally stripes on his piano (and you wonder why he isn't crazy about her?).  There are references to the 1968 Olympics here.

If you liked Peanuts: A Golden Celebration, you're guaranteed to enjoy Peanuts: The Art of Charles M. Schulz.<br />Chip Kidd has done an excellent job with the design of this book (with original clippings of comic strips) and there's a nice introduction by Schulz's widow, Jean Schulz who calls her late husband the genius that he was!  <br />Like many others who pointed this out, I was impressed by the amount of early Peanuts cartoons featuring Charlie Brown (sometimes without his famous jagged striped shirt), Schroeder, Lucy, and Linus as babies (Lucy's eyes were larger and she was a much sweeter girl than what she became). Snoopy walked on all fours, except when he was dancing (he had yet to introduce his many other alter egos, like the World War I Flying Ace and Joe Cool). And does anybody remember Shermy (Charlie Brown's original buddy), Violet, and Patty (no, not Peppermint Patty who would debut in 1966)? At first Violet and Patty were friends to Charlie Brown, but they later became Lucy's Greek Chorus for insults. <br />Interesting moments include Charlie Brown getting Schroeder interested in playing the piano (hence, a musical genius is born), a minor character named Charlotte Braun (who looked a little like Frieda and acted a lot like Lucy later would), and a rare cartoon featuring adults in the background. The book also includes one mistake of Charlie Brown being left with one eye in one cartoon and lists the original 8 newspapers that carried Peanuts (not everybody got to enjoy Peanuts at 1st). You also get a few Little Folks cartoons (which Schulz, then known as Sparky, worked on before Peanuts) and an excerpt from a comic book not even drawn by Schulz. There's a drawing of what the little red haired girl (Charlie Brown's wouldbe girlfriend) may have looked like in Peanuts!  She didn't look at all like the little red haired girl in It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown (a 1977 TV special).  Raretoys, figurines, and board games of the Peanuts gang are displayed. And finally, this book features excerpts and original sketches from I Need All the Friends I Can Get. <br />Special thanks to Chip Kidd for doing a great job compiling this gem and to my sister for getting me this for Christmas!	2002-01-04

This book is for anybody who's seen A Charlie Brown Christmas virtually every year it's been on TV or via VHS or DVD.     It includes storyboards of the Ford commercials which featured Linus and Lucy back in 1962 (3 years before this classic TV special debuted). Not only that, it features advertisements in TV guide, an interview with Bill Melendez, who animated all the Peanuts specials and films up to Charles Schulz's untimely death in 2000), and a few essays from Lee Mendelson, who worked side by side with Melendez on each of the specials. It also features a few words from Peter Robins (the 1st voice of Charlie Brown) and Chris Shea (who played Linus). You also get a tribute to Vince Guaraldi who composed the music (not to mention that it includes the sheet music for \\"Linus and Lucy\\" and \\"Christmastime Is Here\\"). This book mentions how they came up with the adult \\"voices\\" in the specials and Schulz's conditions on working on Charlie Brown Christmas (one was that real children would do the kids' voices, and another was that the Gospel of Luke was present in the script in order to remind the audience the true meaning of Christmas).     Most importantly, this book includes the entire script of Charlie Brown Christmas with stills from the special. In essence, there is enough information for you to cast your own stage production of A Charlie Brown Christmas.  There is one slight error in the script, however- the Peanuts gang is not humming \\"O Little Town of Bethelehem\\" at the finale but \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\" (unless this was written in the original script and changed at the last minute).  Finally, turn the pages and you'll see Snoopy cause Charlie Brown to crash into the tree in the one scene that begins the special!     Recommended to all Peanuts collectors and all who love the classic special that started it all for Peanuts animation.	2001-12-16

His only friend in the world is his stuffed tiger Hobbes who comes to life with Calvin's imagination (Watterson named Hobbes after the Engish philosopher Thomas Hobbes).<br />In this anthology, Watterson explains how he came up with the inspiration of many of his cartoons.  He also talks about some of the other characters like his cynical but long-suffering parents, his teacher Miss Wormwood, Suzie Derkins, who Calvin loves to terrorize, the dumb bully Moe, and Rosalyn, his sometime babysitter who doesn't tolerate much from the little monster!<br />Some of Calvin's adventures include transmogrifying himself into a tiger, duplicating himself (once with a terror just like himself and again as a good, well-behaved carbon copy of himself), turning into Stupendous Man, making snow-goons in the winter, and going on boring camping trips in the summer (which only Calvin's daddy enjoys- &quot;This is fun- it builds character!&quot;).<br />If you were a fan of Calvin and Hobbes when it appeared in the newspaper, you'll want this collection!	2001-08-20

With his imagination, his stuffed tiger comes to life and 2 have many misadventures.  As for Calvin's parents, a line in a popular Joe Walsh song sums up their predicament- they're lucky to be sane after all they've been through!  In the winter, Calvin builds a snowfort right on the driveway so Dad can't get out and holds a funeral of a dead snowman (and gets snowballs thrown at him by Hobbes)!  At school, he can't be bothered to do his assignments, gets sent to the principal's office, pesters Suzie Derkins, and gets terrorized by the dopey bully Moe.  In the summer, Calvin loses a water balloon battle with Suzie (thanks to Hobbes) and goes on boring camping trips with his parents (Mom hates them just as much as Calvin leaving Dad to have all the fun)!  Calvin also hates his baby-sitter Roslyn (who isn't too crazy about Cavin either), won't answer the door when she comes, sneaks out of the house with a rope made out of bedsheets and encourages her boyfriend to dump her on the phone!

Will he win?<br />And being obsessed with the great American sport (baseball), Charlie Brown discovers that he has a rash on his head not unlike a baseball.  He wears a paper sack around his head (to avoid anyone autographing it!) and goes to summer camp.  He later becomes a hero- all because of wearing a sack!	2001-02-23

Back when this was originally published, Peanuts comic books had books exclusively for Sunday cartoons since they took up an entire page.  This book features some of the early Peanuts Sunday features from 1958 to 1961.<br />Snoopy would go through his charades- like a boxer with 1 glove on his nose!  Sally was a new character here and just a baby.  Linus wasn't yet old enough for school and demanded an education.  Yet, he proves to have an impressive imagination as he sees images of the apostle Paul in the clouds.  Pig Pen comes to Violet's birthday party just as sloppy as he always is- but at least his present is clean!  Charlie Brown tries sleeping under the stars but gets scared when he hears a howling sound (Snoopy, of course!).  Of course, he gets no respect as baseball manager and gets laughed at by all the kids.  It's little wonder he gets irked when the radio announcer asks: &quot;What can be more delightful than the sound of laughter from little children?&quot;!  Linus and Lucy both beg their dad to bring them little presents on the way home but Mr. Van Pelt is only taking his car out of the garage to be washed!  Lucy asks Schroeder: &quot;If Beethoven was so great, how come he didn't get to be king?&quot;.  She also tries on one of Charlie Brown's crooked striped T-shirts for a laugh- but this time, the joke's on her!  And most of the Peanuts gang is gathered together for the Christmas paegant.  Linus forgets his lines, but Lucy knows the right cure!	2001-01-29

This book was published 1999, one year before the dreaded Y2K came into effect.  And many of us were ready for the worst even without this book!  Although we're currently in the &quot;new&quot; millenium, this is an intriguing and captivating book with a warning that everything we take for granted in this world can easily be taken away.  The only flaw in House of Gold is that some of the language has a lot to be desired, so it's definitely not recommended for young kids.<br />A lot of the characters from Bud's previous book Conceived Without Sin are back.  Buzz Woodward, the bighearted eccentric, has remarried and has 2 children.  Sam and Ellie Fisk are also back and they seem to have it all together (economically, domestically, and spiritually).  Mark Johnson has long reconciled himself to his family.  The Man has reluctantly opened up his private life to his basketball buddy Buzz and put his faith in God. <br />But with the new millenium on the way (remember, this story begins in 1999), serious danger is predicted.  Buzz does his best to help out his friends and his family.  And it's going to take a miracle for this plan to be pulled off!	2001-01-15

Leonard Maltin has done his homework on this book (he had a lot of movies to watch and review for this one)!  It mentions each of the films that the various Our Gang members starred in (1922-44).  It starts with the Silent Years (featuring Joe Cobb and Mickey Daniels, who would both make cameo features in the Golden Years). Then it moves onto the &quot;Golden Era&quot; Talkies (featuring an all-star cast of Jackie Cooper, Farina, Mary Ann, Norman &quot;Chubby&quot; Chaney, Matthew &quot;Stymie&quot; Beard, George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland, Tommy/Butch Bond, Scottie, Carl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Schwitzer, Waldo, Darla, Billie &quot;Buckwheat&quot; Thomas, and Eugene &quot;Porky&quot; Lee).  In this section, some of the best films of all time are remembered and reviewed: Teacher's Pet, Hook and Ladder, Railroadin' (rarely seen), Forgotten Babies, Hi! Neighbor, Lucky Corner, Fishy Tales (Butch's best performance), and Our Gang Follies 1938 (Alfalfa attempting to sing opera is a scream!).  The MGM era of 1939-44 has its moments though they are limited (featuring Froggie and Mickey better known as Robert Blake).  <br />Maltin includes interviews with Our Gang alumni and fills in what happened to many of them afterward.  A grown up &quot;Porky&quot; Lee sums it up perfectly- you'll be happy to hear about the successes of some (particularly Jackie Cooper, who went on to be a movie director) and depressed to find out the tragedies that befell other Our Gang alumnists (particularly Alfalfa).	2000-11-08

I'm sure there were books about the Beatles written before this, but this book was written with the Beatles (complete with interviews).  Hunter Davies includes some of his own opinions in later editions but this is about the Fab 4, their rise, and where they were in 1968 when this book originally came out (John admits to be bored with life as Yoko Ono had not yet been a household name to us and George was already sick of being a Beatle at the time).  The later editions have a section about the breakup, what they did individually in the 1970's, the tragedy of John Lennon in 1980 and more recent interviews with Paul, George, and Ringo.  You can trust Davies since he got the Beatles' authorization and  respected their privacy (he mentions that George Harrison asked that certain things not be printed).  As Davies points out, this story is about the rise and not the fall.	2000-10-12

The deliverer was glad she didn't have to go to the front office with it since it's so heavy!<br />This book is special because the Beatles themselves are the authors!  There are also contributing quotes from Pete Best, Stuart Sutcliffe, George Martin, Mal Evans, Neil Aspinall and others.<br />The stories are great, from their childhood (John being an avid reader in grade school, Paul's father supporting his music skills, George mastering the guitar at a young age, and Ringo being shuffled in and out of hospitals) to their days in Hamburg (John claims that's where he truly grew up!). <br />In Hamburg, John, Paul, George, Pete, and Stu play various taverns (and meet Ringo) until Stu falls in love and abandons the Beatles.  It seems like Ringo fits in better so they eventually sack Best for Ringo.<br />Funny stories include Mal breaking a windshield on a cold day while driving the Fab Four to their next gig and the Beatles hiding like school kids from an angry George Martin after missing a recording session!  <br />They meet celebrities like Fats Domino, Little Richard, the Queen, and the King (Elvis).  <br />John discusses &quot;Help&quot;, &quot;Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, and &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, Paul discusses &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and the Abbey Road Medley (particularly its highlight &quot;The End&quot;), George discusses &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Taxman&quot;, and Ringo discusses &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot; and &quot;Octopus' Garden&quot;.  <br />There are the sore subjects, too, like Manilla (Paul claims they were the 1st to snub Marcos), John's comments about Jesus, the death of Brian Epstein, the breakup coming close on the White Album and later on Let It Be.  <br />Although some of the photos and interviews here can be seen and heard in the Anthology video series and some perhaps read in other books, this brings most everything you need to know about the Beatles in full circle.  <br />And of course, the Beatles experiment with drugs (and later both John and George get  busted by Sgt. Pilcher for possession of them), seek spiritual guidance from the Maharishi (is he as &quot;cosmic&quot; as they think?), fall in love (John with Yoko, Paul with Linda).  Unlike in the video series, there is mention of Paul being &quot;dead&quot; and the final nail in the coffin for the Beatles in late 1969 and 1970.  <br />You can't tell it all even in this one (no mention of the Christmas singles, save for a poem by John called &quot;Wonsapon a Pool Table&quot;), but since the Beatles themselves (and their closest comrades) speak for the Beatles, a lot of myths and legends are put to rest.  If you're a Beatles fan, you won't want to pass this by!	2000-10-10

This was one of the books I had to read for college back in the late 1980's.  It had been just a few years after the PTL Scandals and Jimmy Swaggart's weepy confession (I'm sure many of you remember these incidents).  My professor pointed out the simmilar attitudes between them and the character Tartuffe.  Tartuffe, when you get to know him, is really a cheap bum using religion to get what he wants.  It's not long before the family he's mooching off finds out what a snake he really is (and the results are hilarious)!  Written back in the 19th century, it's amazing how simmilar events were back then compared to more recent history!

That's the good part.  The bad part is that with the exception of one interview of George Harrison and some quotes from the Fab Four, most of the interviews are from outsiders like a bouncer in the Cavern Club, Harry Nilson, Peter Brown (who wrote the trivial telltale The Love You Make), Mike McGear (Paul's brother), Julian Lennon (John's son), Neil Innes (who starred in the Rutles), and Mr. McKensie (who Geoffery claims without a whole lot of proof was the inspiration to Fr. McKensie in &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;).  In essence, what we learn from them is through hearsay (although some have some interesting stories to tell) and we really don't learn much of anything from Guliano about the Beatles that we don't already know.  Also, some of the comments below the pictures have a lot to be desired: how are we to know that Geoffery is telling us the truth about the pictures?  If you're a collector, you might want this book (since it's currently out of print) but I can't recommend it to Beatles purists.	2000-10-01

It also took a lot of courage to tell about some of the struggles they had together while choosing Catholicism.  Both were raised Presbyterians, met in college, fell in love, and got married (Kimberly describes this as the Spring of their relationship).  Kimberly is forced to write her thesis on contraception (since all the other theses are already spoken for) and Scott tries to refute Catholicism.  This is what Scott describes as his &quot;detective story&quot;.  It turns out Scott starts to become interested in Catholicism and must make a choice as to what he believes is right (described as the &quot;horror story&quot; by Scott and the Autumn of their relationship by Kimberly since he was then teaching at a Protestant college).  Needless to say, Scott converts to Catholicism (described as the &quot;love story&quot; by Scott since Scott falls in love with the church) and this saddens Kimberly, who is still content with her Presbyterian faith.  Differences in belief and turning down offers to teach at other Protestant colleges make the marriage hard since Scott cannot share with Kimberly what Catholicism means to him without making her uncomfortable (the &quot;Winter&quot; of their relationship).  Finally, Kimberly checks out what Scott has grown to love more and more and it isn't long before she's interested in the Catholic faith!<br />Since this book was written by both of them, it tells what each one went through as they take turns writing paragraphs.  This book comes with Bible verses and quotations from early Church teachings which back up why Scott and Kimberly grow to accept the Catholic faith as their faith!	2000-09-30

It's too bad this book is out of print, especially since Friz Freleng was  in the Warner Brothers studio from 1930 to about 1966.  In addition, he  created the Pink Panther and many other cartoons with David DePatie (late  1960's to early 1970's) and worked with Walt Disney and MGM in the early  days (1920's).  That's no small resume, considering he'd been in the  cartoon business for nearly 60 of his 89 years.

Also, he talks about growing up, how real life  inspired his cartoons, what it was like working in Warner Bros studio, pays  tribute to partners Tex Avery, Friz Freleng, Mike Malthese, and Abe  Levitow, and talks about other projects he's done (like his How to Draw  From the Fun Side of Your Brain).  And as the other reviewers have pointed  out, there's an animated cartoon of the Roadrunner and the Coyote on the  pages of this book.<br />Since this book was originally published, he's  produced one video in the 1990's (Chariots of Fur) and the historical and  whimsical book Daffy for President (available through the US Postal  Service).	2000-09-05

I liked what most of the reviewers had to say about this book.  For  anybody who is a fan of the animated Warner Bros. cartoons, this book is a  must for you.  It's hard to keep up with the titles of certain cartoons (I  mean how many people know the singing frog cartoon as &quot;One Froggy  Evening&quot; or the cartoon featuring &quot;Tea For Two&quot; with the  tapdance duet with Bugs and Daffy as &quot;Show Biz Bugs&quot;?).     <br />This guide deals with them all (one reviewer says this is 1,000)- from  the beginning with the black and white Bosco cartoons (1930)to the early  days of Porky Pig (no, Mel Blanc was not the original voice; he didn't  supply Porky's voice until about 1938), to the evolution of Bugs Bunny,  Elmer Fudd (Mel Blanc was not the original voice of this character either;  Arthur Q Bryan was), Daffy Duck, Tweety, Speedy Gonzales, the 1st color  Looney Tune (circa 1942), to the introduction of Yosemite Sam, Sylvester,  the Roadrunner and Coyote, Sylvester, jr, the Tasmanian Devil (who became  very famous despite the fact that he was only in about 4 cartoons during  this period of 4 decades), to the closing of the Warner Bros studio in 1969  (whose final days brought us many forgettable catoon characters like Cool  Cat and Merlin the Magical Mouse).  <br />It mentions who directed each  cartoon (Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, Tex Avery, and others)  who composed the music (often Carl Stalling or Milt Franklyn), and includes  a synopsis of each and every cartoon.  <br />A lot of hard work went into  putting this together, obviously.  If you loved these cartoons as a kid and  still do, this book is for you!  Th-th-th-th-that's all, folks!	2000-09-05

I wish there were more writers like Bud McFarlane, jr and Frank Perretti (author of This Present Darkness)!  This book teaches you a lot about the  importance of faith and has a lot of action (particularlly near the end) in  it as well!  <br />Bud McFarlane captures the imagination of the reader by  telling a little information on each of his characters.  Nathan Payne is  the strong-silent hero of this story deeply in love with the shy, charming  Joanie Wheat.  He's had some not-so-great relationships and Joanie helps  him forget them and start anew.  Becky Macadam is portrayed as beautiful  and successful (with a tough exterior) but carries a baby of a guy who  cared nothing for her.  With the help of Joe Jackson, she is able to move  on from her personal trauma.  Then there's the friendly, laid back (but  deeply devoted) priest Fr. Chet Sullivan.

I saw this book about 8 years ago at a college library.  It features some of the best Dennis the Menace cartoons and tells of some of Hank Ketcham's real-life adventures (Hank is the author of the classic cartoon).  Hank  based the cartoon on himself and his real-life son, Dennis (He used to tell  people &quot;Our son Dennis is a real menace!&quot;).  If you look at some  of the real-life family photos, you'll notice quite a resemblance between  the Mitchell family and the Ketcham family!   Hank Ketcham later took off  to live in Europe in the 1960's (there's a hilarious cartoon that shows Mr.  Wilson's delight that Dennis is going on a vacation but disappointed that  his little nemesis will be returning!).  Some of you may not understand a  lot of what I'm talking about in this review and I guess you'd have to pick  up a copy of The Merchant of Dennis the Menace to get a better idea of what  I'm saying (which, unless this gets reprinted, many of you may never get  the chance).	2000-07-11

In this valuable collection, Schroeder goes crazy because he has forgotten Beethoven's birthday, Linus is cruelly  forced to sing &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; at the PTA Paegant (his loving  sister Lucy volunteers him), Charlie Brown complains of feeding the dog  &quot;...and you don't get any thanks for it... usually.&quot;, Snoopy  guards his house from the bulldozers, and Sally has a secret (&quot;We  prayed in school today!&quot;).  All of us avid Peanuts fans are praying  for a reprint of this and other Peanuts books!	2000-06-29

Gereon Goldmann takes you through life in Europe during WWII (and especially when serving in the German military).  Goldmann proves to be faithful to God and his country, in spite of the hardships and trials.  How  easy it would be to despair when your own country accuses you of being a  traitor, like Goldmann's country did.  But remember, Germany was under the  Nazi regime and naturally, if you stood for justice against prejudice, you  were considered a traitor.  Fr. Goldmann is ordained a priest while serving  as a soldier and changes the lives of many while in combat.  This edition  takes you where the original story left off (it was origianlly published in  1964), and Fr. Goldmann moves on to minister in Japan.	2000-06-27

Snoopy runs away and meets his original owner, Lila, and Charlie Brown finds out the hard way that he is not Snoopy's original owner!   CLUNK!  He wasn't ready for that shock!  Snoopy also has trouble sleeping  due to fear of things that go &quot;AUGH!&quot; (like Charlie Brown, after  he's denied a chance to kick the coveted football).  And who stands in for  Charlie Brown when the little red haired girl to pitch (whom she rewards  with a big hug)?  Hint- it isn't Schroeder, who probably isn't much fun on  a date anyways- unless you dig Beethoven!	2000-06-25

It seemed like Peanuts was truly finding its niche at the time these cartoons came out.  You had Lucy being bossy, crabby, and chatty (is it any  wonder Charlie Brown complained about stomach cramps when she was trying to  teach Linus the &quot;facts of life&quot;?).  Linus was beginning to enjoy  the comforts of his blanket.  Snoopy had learned how to dance and pantomime  (he's a scream when he does imitations of Lucy, Violet, Beethoven- much to  Schroeder's offense and Mickey Mouse).  Charlie Brown had started asking  the question &quot;How come nobody likes me?&quot; and of course, loses  every baseball game (unless it's raining and the other team never shows  up).<br />Btw, the title comes from a cartoon where Charlie builds a birdhouse  for sparrows.	2000-06-10

This book features the Peanuts gang in the mid-1970's.  In the story which inspired the title, Peppermint Patty shares a desk with the slightly embarrased Charlie Brown.  Peppermint Patty nags poor old Chuck to death until Charlie Brown finally yells &quot;Stop criticizing me!&quot;- you  tell her, Chuck!  As for Peppermint Patty, she gets so upset her mood ring  pops!  Schroeder humors Lucy after she's asked 1 too many stupid questions  (&quot;Do you think Beethoven was a better musician than Elton John?&quot;)  and graciously dons a pair of Elton's specs magnaminously given by  you-know-who.	2000-06-07

This collection features the early days of Peanuts as they appeared in the Sunday Paper.  Lucy tries hard to get Schroeder's attention (but  he's not having any of that).  Snoopy acts crazy even in the early days (he  scratches up an LP record with his teeth, causes the other team a home run,  and ruins a nice game of paddleball for his master Charlie Brown, he even  has a TV set inside the doghouse).  Pig Pen is a mess, and Linus endures  Lucy's fussbudget ways or her inane lectures on life.  And then there's  good old Charlie Brown, who can't get a break on the croquet field, gets  stranded on ice and needs a little help from Snoopy, and can't win a game.   Classic line used by Charlie: &quot;You drive me crazy!&quot;	2000-05-30

In it, you will see what inspired specials like &quot;A Boy Named CB&quot;, &quot;It Was a Short Summer, CB&quot; and &quot;You're Not Elected,  CB&quot;.  You have the born loser Charlie Brown going to a rained out  baseball game, making a friend at summer camp, and trying to fly his kite.   You have the philosophical Linus who thinks he's discovered a wooden sphere  and tries to share his theological viewpoints.  Lucy is as crabby as ever  as she chews Charlie Brown out in psychiatric help when not pulling that  football away.  Peppermint Patty gives a card to her father who calls her a  &quot;rare gem&quot;.  Schroder is the cartoon's musical maestro, Sally  jumps rope and pesters Charlie Brown, Pig Pen is a mess, and Woodstock is  introduced.  Oh yes, let's not forget Snoopy who plays the Easter Beagle, a  vulture, the World War I Flying Ace, author of &quot;It Was a Dark &amp;  Stormy Night&quot;, and himself at Halloween (and mistaken as &quot;some  kid in a dog costume&quot;!)!

Probably because it reminded me of the rivalry between the &quot;jocks&quot; and the &quot;freaks&quot; in my own High School.<br />The narrator is Ponyboy, sensitive with a tough exterior.  Since his parents are deceased, he and his laid-back older brother Soda are taken  care of Darrel the eldest, who's a bossy perfectionist (really only worried  that he might lose his baby brothers).  There's Johnny Cade, whose family  life is insufferable.   There's Dallas Winston, mean and gruff (but has a  soft spot for Johnny).  And then there are the Soc's, the spoiled kids who  like to pick on the greasers for fun (the &quot;fun&quot; runs out when  their buddy is killed).  And let's not forget Cherry Valence, who though  dating a Soc has a heart and a mind all her own. <br />While Pony and Johnny  hide out after the murder, with Dallas coming to their aid and rescue, the  3 &quot;greasers&quot; temporarily clean the slate of all stereotypes and  somehow wind up as heroes!  If you're wondering how these events occur, go  read the story!  You won't be disappointed!	2000-03-18

A lot of what happens to Holden Caulfield is what we've all experienced.  Many of us have been chewed out by teachers (but  probably not while they're sickly and their pajamas!).  A lot of us have  blown a date by putting one of our feet in our mouths (&quot;You're giving  me a pain in...&quot;).  And I think most of us have been obnoxious to our  fellow classmates (&quot;I'm really enjoying reading this sentence over and  over, Ackley Kid!&quot;).  <br />Holden hates phonies, but to a certain extent  can be a phony himself (lying about his age and telling his date whom he  cares little about he loves her). It seems like the only one who can set  him straight is his little sister, a tough girl to fool.  She also corrects  him on the song &quot;If a body catch a body...&quot;, oops, I mean  &quot;meet a body&quot;!  Whatever!	2000-03-07

The part about him winding up in a psychiatrist's office years later I really didn't pick up on until years  later when I reread the story.  It seems like wherever he goes he's running  around in circles!  He gets kicked out of school, chewed out by an ill  teacher, acts obnoxious to his schoolmates, dumped by an old girlfriend  (after sticking his foot in his mouth!), and gets ripped off by a hooker.   With the exception of the last adventure mentioned (although may be typical  for some), these are all situations familiar to every teenage kid.  Like  most teenagers, he sees the phoniness in others and yet is willing to be a  phony to virtually anybody else- except his younger sister.  She in turn  sees right through his games and is his only friend!	2000-02-25

I don't know where or how you're going to get the 1st Peanuts book, but if you do, please let me know!  Anyways, this book is the early years of Charlie Brown, Lucy, Schroeder, Patti (no not Peppermint Patty who would  come into the picture years later), Voilet, and Shermy.  Also, Linus is  introduced here as a baby.  The characters look a little different than  what you're used to since many of these cartoons originally date from 1952  and 1953.  Lucy is kind of cute with her big eyes (no Psychiatric Help  booth yet) and Snoopy was still a little puppy (he hadn't yet climbed to  the top of his doghouse but he knew how to drive Charlie Brown and  Schroeder nuts!).  Anyways, a must for your collection if you can get your  hands on it!	2000-02-22

It seems like once every 5 or 10 years, there has been a book about the history of Peanuts.  This one is almost complete, considering it came out a month or 2 before Schulz's surgery right before his retirement (which I  think helped alleviate the devastation of the sad news on 12 February).   It'll probably be a collector's item since Schulz stated in this book he  had no plans to retire.  <br />This book features some of the best Peanuts  cartoons, and touches only briefly on the classic Charlie Brown TV specials  (the book's only disappointment).<br />Mostly, this book emphasizes what I  love about Peanuts.  I love Charlie Brown because he's the perfect  everyman, somone like you and me (mainly me).  I love Linus for his  philosophical viewpoints (he has the answer to everything except why the  Great Pumpkin never pays him a visit!).  I love Lucy because she's dared to  say and do the things we only wish we could!  And I love Snoopy because he  can do it all (a shortstop, a World War I Flying Ace, a vulture, a dancer,  an author, and Joe Cool!)!<br />Goodbye, Sparky, and thanks for everything!

Linus and Lucy had temporarily moved away in 1966 (when most of the cartoons in this book were originally published).  Also, Peppermint Patty (the stringy haired tomboy who had a crush on &quot;Chuck&quot;, whooped his tail at baseball, and got straight D-minuses) emerged this year- one of the 1st more &quot;modern&quot; characters- she would later introduce Franklin and &quot;Sir&quot; Marcie.

I liked the fact that Brian emerged from the unhealthy lifestyle he was leading. I also liked the fact that Brian was honest that he regretted not being a better father figure to his children Wendy and Carnie.  But what I didn't like was that he slandered many members of his family and the Beach Boys (though I can easily understand in the case of his sadistic father, I think he was particularly unfair to his brother Carl in the book, who did his best to have Landy fired). Few of us need to know in the acknowledgements that certain people (group and family members) didn't help him with the project. It is amusing, however, hear him poke fun at Mike Love (&quot;with the baseball cap covering his bald mane...&quot; and &quot;....staring at me with those gun-barrel blue eyes&quot;).  I also question how much praise Eugene Landy is really due.  Though he helped Brian, Landy also wore out his usefulness and milked Brian of his independence. In a 1999 interview with Brian Wilson, Brian wisely refused to comment on Dr. Landy (wise since it could've meant more lawsuits from either Mike Love or from Landy). I love Brian Wilson and I love the Beach Boys, and there were some good insights in this book about Brian's life.  It would be nice to read an updated version of this book (you have different schools of thought as to whether Landy helped Brian more than he hurt him or vice versa).  Still, this is an interesting book to read if you can get your hands on it (some libraries still carry it).	2000-01-29

Thomas is a well-meaning but rather tactless environmentalist.  His brother Peter is more concerned about Thomas making  a fool out of himself than trying to fix the situation.  Just like in real  life, there are no easy solutions but there are plenty of alibis and  irrational negotiations from politicians (&quot;If you'll just take back  what you said...&quot;).  The only friend Thomas really has is the reader.	2000-01-23

This is an interesting and well-written play but neither Torvald nor Norma are very likable characters.  I agree that Torvald is an arrogant,  self-centered man.  Instead of saying &quot;I appreciate what you've done,  Norma, but you can go to jail for that.  By the way, I haven't been fair to  you.&quot;, at 1st he gets mad and threatens to break it all off, then he  says &quot;I forgive you, Norma.  No, really, it doesn't mean a thing to  me.  I'm only making an issue of this so you know I forgive you,  honey!&quot;.  In essence, he doesn't really love his wife.  He treats her  like property.  But Norma is no saint, either.  She just walks off and  leaves without any real thought about how she's going to make it on her  own.  While it's hard to blame her for considering this, she's only making  herself vulnerable to the outside world in a very dangerous way.  She's  even willing to let her husband raise their children his way.  Naturally,  it will have a traumatizing effect on them, like any child of a divorced  parent.  Sorry, but I think she just took the easy way out, just like many  who seek divorce do.  And neither one is guaranteed happiness.  Torvald  should have apologized to Norma for his attitude and Norma should have  forgiven him.  Doing what you want without realizing the consequences isn't  freedom.  Free will is necessary in life, but it doesn't invalidate right  and wrong.	2000-01-23

Amazon.com, I don't know what was wrong with the last 2 reviews I left.  Hopefully, you'll print this one!<br />This book may have been written 80 years ago to this writing, but the message is no less relevant.  Greed and  the lust of power are dangerous.  Our hero Jay Gatsby becomes a victim to  the American Dream.  All because he has a crush on the conceited airhead  Daisy Buchanan.  The problem is that Daisy is already married to arrogant  rich bully Tom Buchanan.  Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story, remains  Gatsby's only true friend.  It is not for nothing Nick tries to warn Gatsby  of the so-called upper class: &quot;They're a worthless lot!  You're worth  the whole d___ group put together!&quot;	2000-01-13
