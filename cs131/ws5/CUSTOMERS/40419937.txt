And that is absolutely correct, it is flawed and wouldn't work, here, with American or Canadian citizens.<br /><br />The point that the book makes is that the system works quite well, \\"there\\" with French citizens. It also shows why the French don't \\"get\\" the Americans, they look at us with the same biases that we look at them, and  conclude that our system is flawed, and shouldn't work; here, because it wouldn't work there.<br /><br />All in all a very enlightening book.	2005-09-30

A child is deported to a concentration camp with his family, innocent of any crimes except being related to his grandfather, who is simply accused of an unnamed crime against the state. The grandfather is not held with them, and they receive no news of him. Also they know not for how long their imprisionment will last, or if it will ever end.<br /><br />How the family survives in the gulag of Yodok, how they capture and eat rats for a living, and how their lives continue, after being \\"freed\\" from the gulag.<br /><br />Years after, being suspected of \\"listening to a foreign radio station\\" the author finally leaves North Korea through China, makes his way to South korea, and eventually tells his story.<br /><br />Rivaling anything written about the Holocaust in Europe, this story reminds me of Armando Valladares' \\"Against all hope\\"<br /><br />A must read for anyone interested in foreign relations, and a clear indictment of one of the most heinous of current regimes.	2005-07-06

Some are well written, by scholars, where all the knowledge is second hand. Some are written from first hand knowledge, by the sex workers themselves, who, on many occassions lack the needed skills for good, effective written communication.<br />Here is a book, written from a first person perspective, by someone who, being an anthropology PhD, can and does write effectively, has the know-how to write a book on the subject and make it interesting, educational, and yes, also prurient.<br />This is a narrative of her years as an expensive call-girl in Boston, working for a small agency. It does not pretend to show life in other, larger, and less \\"decently\\" run agencies, although it does show a few snapshots of girls in other agencies.<br />This is also not a report on other facets of the sex insdustry, i.e brothels, or street hookers. They are mentioned \\"en passant\\" but not dwelt on.<br />However, for anyone who is interested, pruriently or not, on the ins and outs of the life of call-girls, a great read.	2005-06-28

Under Wavell first, and Auchinlek later, he retreated with the Commonwealth armies into India, and later on led the allied armies into victory against the Japanese forces.<br /><br />His writing is clear, concise, and he does not spare himself from criticism, Often after describing an order he gave, or wished he had given, he will go on to explain how his plan was a mistake, and how he should have done it instead. This is precious insight on the mind of the commander. In many first person war stories, we are told what happened, but not why, and when errors are committed, there is always a lot of blame sharing. Here it is different. Slim tells you what he did wrong, when, and why. This is refreshing.<br /><br />He shows great respect for his enemy, and describes the enemy's gallant attacks and heroic defenses with respect and appreciation for the heroism of the Japanese soldier. He does not fail to condemm the Japanese war crimes.<br /><br />He exhibits great wit in describing the different attitudes of the Indian, Sikh and Gurkha soldiers. In one instance, after a Japanese attack in Inphal, some Gurkhas had been ordered to bury the enemy bodies. One of these wasn't dead yet, so the Gurkha trooper gets ready to cut the enemy's head off with his Kukri knife; a British officer tells him \\"Don't kill him!\\", and the Gurkha answers \\"But sir, we can't bury him alive!\\" Episodes like this give a great sense of realism and \\"being there\\" to the whole story.<br /><br />The best book I've read to date on the Burma front.	2005-06-15

I am not recommending that you do so though; 120 Days of Sodom is not a book to be enjoyed.<br /><br />All in all a hard book to read, but also a worthwhile exercise.	2005-06-15

Caring and compassion have become a profession. Beef is outlawed because it is cruel to cows, and chicken is barely tolerable, but not in polite society.<br /><br />In this stew of political correctness, and racial and cultural hypersensitivity, only different by a degree or so from actual reality in many of our work and home environments, a satire develops. The writing is tight, funny and thought provoking.<br /><br />How much does sensitivity hurt others? How much should people be protected from minor inconveniences?<br /><br />Read this and laugh out loud. It would be funnier if it wasn't so real.

Despite professional interpreters, it seems that there is an inpenetrable wall between members of some inmigrant cultures and US healthcare providers.<br /><br />This book narrates one such conflict, between the parents and family of a little Hmong girl, affected by severe epilepsy, and the doctors and nurses at a teaching hospital in Mercer, California.<br /><br />Sometimes without interpreters, sometimes with interpreters, the failure to \\"get through\\" to the family frustrated the chronically overworked residents of Mercer Hospital. The failure of the doctors and staff of Mercer Hospital to understand and agree with the family frustrated in turn the family of the little girl. Every single interaction between the two cultures, Hmong family on one side, and American medical establishment on the other, is interpreted by each side in the worst possible light.<br /><br />There is a sense of inpending tragedy in the narrative, and as it is intertwined with the story of the Hmong people, and their exodus from Laos, one family's tragedy is inextricably merged with the tragedy of a people.<br /><br />I learned from this book, but, unfortunately, I am not optimistic that I can communicate better with people with such different world views.<br /><br />A must read by any member of the health professions that deals with non-European minorities.

The tale of ordinary guys, obsessed by discovery. These guys risk life, marriage and sanity to uncover a secret: What submarine is this? They are not chasing treasure, or adventure. They want the long dead German sailors to be known. Their families to know where their loved ones rest. To unravel this mistery, three divers will die in the wreck. Marriages will break up.<br /><br />The writing is fast paced, but with enough depth on all the major players, so you can care and understand their feelings.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that, for the two short days that the book lasted me, I read nothing else, and ignored everything not related to it, the story was so compulsively obsessive.<br /><br />I recommend it highly.	2005-01-18

I was quite impressed by the movie, and now I am thoroughly awed by the book.<br />From comissioning to the final outcome of the war, this is the story of the ship's captain, and of its crew.<br />In an era of scientific and mechanized war, here is a ship, whose best detection device was, most of the time, the Mark I eyeball, and that, during almost two years at sea, plied havoc with allied shipping, in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans.<br />As I read the book, I could imagine Jno Aubrey (of Patrick O'Brian fame) reading along, thrilling to the chase.<br />WWII was obviously brutal, bloody and terrible; but the story of the Atlantis hearkens to another era; an era of personal honor, bravery, and gallantry, that alas, is now absent from the annals of history.<br />An outstanding book, for the sea enthusiast, naval buff, or anybody who enjoys a good yarn.	2004-06-02

In WW II, after the Pearl Harbor disaster, in all the well known battles, Coral Sea, Midway, Okinawa, the US Navy was the top dog. Even in the running battle of Guadalcanal, the US Navy was not inferior to the Imperial Japanese forces.<br />It may make us wonder: How would the US sailors do, if they did not have air superiority.? If their carrier forces were not nearby; Would the men of the Navy still be as brave? as resolute?<br />Here is the answer. Off Samar, in the Philipines, an inferior US Navy force of escort carriers, destroyers and destroyer escorts was surprised by a superior Japanese force of battleships, heavy and light cruisers, and destroyers.<br />The officers and sailors manning this ships were mostly recruits, citizen soldiers, not career navy types.<br />How the men and women of the US Navy reacted, fought and died is the subject of this book.<br />The narrative is smooth, rich in detail, placing you in the midst of the action. The men are real, you can identify with them. The action is hot, vividly described, you can almost see the shells landing and smell the fuel oil burning.<br />Their actions in the face of overwhelming odds should make any American proud of these gallant men, and their defiance in the face of impossible odds.<br />God bless them.	2004-05-16

There is a great storyline, based on an alternate reality Europe, with enough of real history thrown in, to keep you trying to guess at the final outcome. The writing is elegant and baroque. The plot, has been well described by others; no need to delve into it.<br />Phedre, our heroine, is a servant of Naamah, or in other word a sacred prostitute, indentured into the service of a nobleman, who is half spy, half poet. From this unauspicious beginnings, she will go on to become a heroine of her land.<br />There has been meticulous research done, in the writing of this book. The language of the Tsingani (The gypsies) does approach the Romani that real gypsies speak, and the Habiru (Hebrew) that the Yeshuites (the Jews have accepted Jesus (Yeshua) as their Messiah in the story, go figure) is indeed Hebrew.<br />There is erotica and S&M in the story, but it is unobtrusive, and should not offend anyone, unless he is a real prude. Ms. Carey smartly uses French terms for some of the erotic terms, such as \\"languisement\\" and this, not only keeps it exotic, but probably prevents some of the more easily offended readers from taking real offense.<br />The cultural research is accurate, the plot moves along, and I felt drawn into it from the beginning. The large number of characters, and the complex relations between them do not pose a problem; there is a dramatis personae at the beggining which is helpful, if you get lost.<br />If you like high fiction, you will love this. If you are looking for an erotic kick, this is not for you.<br />I would not recommend this book for anyone under 15-16 though. (18 if you are really conservative)There are some homosexual scenes in the story, elegantly related, and non-explicit, but be warned.	2004-05-14

Is Peace possible between the Islamic community and the West?<br />Bernanrd Lewis, a noted Islamist, attempts to explain to the American public the thought process of the Arab mind. To do this to a people to whom anything beyond Vietnam is old history, and generally considered irrelevant, is a Herculean task, hardly likely to succeed.<br />Yet, if there is to be any kind of peace, or of containment of Islamic fundamentalism, and the terror that it carries, an understanding of the historical issues that affect the Arab (and by extension the Muslim) mind is, not only essential, but urgent.<br />The author explains quite clearly how Western culture corrupts and destroys the very fabric of Islamic family values and society.<br />Inadvertently, Western values penetrate the Islamic societies. The internet is everywhere, despite the Islamic governments efforts  to censor it and limit access. Satellite TV and radio transmissions are heard and seen, within their borders. This is viewed as an invasion. Thus we, the west, become aggressors against their way of life.<br />The contrast between their values, and ours; religion as the central tenet, and guiding light of the law, versus our secular view, that places religion only as a distant philosophical reference point is as clear as the skies and the black smoke over the towers on that fateful September 11th.	2004-05-07

As a pilot, I appreciate his narrative, and as a WW-2 buff, his descriptions of camps, and trading booze for building supplies.<br />The introspection of the author, as he accumulates missions, until the flight doctor strongly suggests to him that he ground himself, is in stark contrasts with the feelings expressed by other pilots in the European theater. It is interesting and educational to note how, the different scenario affects the pilots differently.

Nothing similar was to appear in human history until the Declaration of Independence. It is no coincidence that the Republic, and the way it worked reads like a Washington DC primer.<br />This whole series provides a well researched, and mostly historically accurate chronicle of the Roman republic, since the times of Gaius Marius, through Sulla, Pompeii, Caesar, up to the end of the civil war that followed Caesar's murder.<br />Some liberties are taken with historical fact, to flesh out the characters, but the story follows very closely the available historical texts.<br />This, the last volume of the epic, follows Caesar's dictatorship, from the final struggle with Cato's republicans, through Caesar's murder, and the civil war that followed.<br />Masterfully written, it enthralls and captivates.<br />My first Roman historical novel was, as is for many, Robert Grave's I Claudius/Claudius the God series. I found it fascinating to meet Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, seen in I Claudius as an older man, past his prime, but a loyal Octavian ally, as a young officer in Caesar's army, helping Octavius in his struggle for power. Asinus Pollio, also of Claudian fame, appears in this story as a historian allied to Brutus.<br />A treat to any admirer of Rome.<br />Only one thing would make it better.

The debate was on bullfighting. The opponents of bullfighting, who would like to see the spectacle outlawed, declared that &quot;No good intelectual approved of bulfighting&quot; &quot;What about Hemingway?&quot; asked one of the proponents.<br />What about Hemingway. He has simply written the best book I've ever read on the event/show/tradition of bullfighting. He loved it dearly, and this love permeates every page on the book. His descriptions of the corridas, of the cities where the &quot;Fiestas&quot; are held, although quite dated by now, hold an everlasting charm, that illustrates the scenes, with an expert palette of colors.<br />Are you going to Spain? Are you planning to see a &quot;corrida de toros&quot;? If you read this book, you will know what it is about, and you will be able to appreciate it. The only thing better than this, would be to have a seat next to an &quot;entendido&quot; who would explain the whole &quot;fiesta&quot; to you.<br />I read this book in high school, and reread it now, 27 years later. It is still enthralling, and its charm has only gotten better over the years.<br />Hemingway saw the bullfight as a stylized tragedy; his understanding of the bullfight, mixes with his understanding and love for Spain. At the end, he cannot escape the conclusion that Spain would not be Spain, withouth the bulls and the bullfighting. This even though only a minority of Spaniards go to bullfights, or are even remotely interested in the &quot;fiesta&quot;<br />It's a pity there is no one now who could develop an updated version of this classic.	2003-08-11

Then there are works, that are perhaps not as accurate, not as exact, but that show you how things actually were, and the influences and connections that shaped history. This is not one of the former, but definitely it is one of the latter.<br />There are inaccuracies. Knight might have originally meant a minor landed noble in old Anglo Saxon, but the Spanish, French and Italian terms (Caballero, Chevalier, and Cavalieri) mean just horseman. There are also a couple of proofreading errors, but they are obvious.<br />Now for the good part. The book tells a story. It tells the story of a continent that is seeped in darkness, and of its slow ascent into light. Of how the light of reason takes over where the oscurantism of revelation used to rule. How the revolution of reason permitted the reform movements of Luther and Calvin; and how those reform movements, commited the same atrocities that the original church had and was guilty of. No punches are pulled, and no confession is respected.<br />This book may not allow you to pass a medieval history final, but after reading it, you will know and understand, not only what was going on in Europe's darkest age, but why and how. What was gained and lost as the Renaissance dawned on the horizon; and also, there are interesting inferences that can be drawn, appropriate for modern times, on other areas of the world, where revelation rather than reason, alas, still holds sway.<br />I read it in two days, and highly recommend it to the amateur historian, or to anyone who would like to know what it felt like to live in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.	2003-06-17

How come?<br />It's simple. If you identify with the heroes, John Galt, Hank Rearden, Dagny Taggart, and Francisco D'Anconia, you will love the book, because it agrees with your idea of morality, and your sense of life. If you like your thoughts clear and focused, and think that a concept must be consistent with itself to the root, you will love this piece of work.<br />If you think the heroes are insensitive, evil egoists, with no appreciation for art, or for other people's needs, then you may identify more with Dagny's brother and his friends. (On the other hand, I don't think anybody could be that evil)<br />If your philosophy of life agrees more with a subjective sense of good and evil; if you think that the limits between good and evil are fuzzy, and that sacrifice is the leading value in life, you will hate this book, and blast its author.<br />After reading this book, I realized that this work is a test of moral character. (Within reason). If you like this book, you are probably a self driven, self motivated person, who holds his own values above everything else. You are self assured and derive your self esteem from your own perception of yourself. If you hate this book, you thrive on relationships, you are sensitive to other's perception of yourself, and seek to influence others. Your self esteem also derives from how you are perceived.<br />I gave the book five stars, because I can't give it six.<br />Enough said.	2003-05-28

I somehow hoped to find in it something new; after all, this was an attorney, a judge; mayhaps there could be a new insight, on the problem of lawyers and judges runnign amok.<br />Alas, it was not to be. The book is well researched, well, almost; in ch 4, when discussing the ADM Ethanol boondoggle, MS. Crier confuses Ethanol (grain alcohol) with Methanol (wood alcohol). However, much of it is basically a rehash of P.K. Howard's \\"The death of Common Sense\\"<br />A few insights on how PACs work, and soft money influence on the Federal, State and local governments, but nothing really new.<br />The promised comments on how we can retake our government seem to me a series of platitudes, with as much chance of happening as Ralph Nader of becoming president.<br />The one area of interest, and the one ray of hope, was where Ms. Crier explained how big industry bribes both parties equally, with one exception. The trial lawyers almost exclusively supported (i.e. bribed) the democratic party candidates. Lo and behold, they backed the wrong horse, and, here is the ray of hope, we might, just might, see some significant tort reform.<br />I'm not holding my breath though.<br />If you have not read \\"The death of common sense\\" then this one is worth a try	2003-05-05

The characters are realistically created, and their personas develop, sometimes in surprising fashion.<br />As opossed to conventional series, each character can and will surprise you, at the most unexpected moment. For instance,the evil Jaime, turns out not to be so evil after all, the Imp is actually quite honest, once you get to know him, and so on.<br />As you move through the story, you see that the preconceived notions that you have, are shattered time and again. But the characters remain true to their motivations. It is this consistency that is so hard to create and maintain by most writers. If the character is consistent, then he won't surprise you.<br />Mr. Martin however can and will keep his characters consistent, and yet, they surprise you, once and again.<br />It is unbelievable the dexterity with which he does so.	2003-05-02

That said, the book exceeded my expectations. All too often great fantasy stories follow a set plot: Little boy or girl, gets chased around,pursued by the evil one, develops his/her magic power/fighting prowess, comes back kills the evil one and gets the girl/boy as the case may be.<br />This is not that kind of story. After completing the book, I am still not sure who the villain is. (Except for the evil queen) Or even if there is a villain. All the characters'actions follow their motives and personalities, in a coherent fashion. The plot twists and turns, and keeps you guessing. After a while you realize that you really do not know how it will end. The story just absorbs you.<br />There is lust, violence and subtle eroticism; incest, treason, nobility and heroism. All the ingredients are there for a great series, and Martin weaves the characters and their motivations in a complex tapestry that really moves the story along.<br />A word about technique, each chapter is written from the point of view of one of the characters, and the chapter is named after the character, which helps keep you oriented.<br />A useful appendix is present at the end, which would be very useful had I read it before the story. Alas I had only the PDA download, so I did not know it. Also, if you get the PDA download, the maps are so small as to be useless.	2003-04-09

All of the authors, whether historians or participants,were handicapped by the lack of the whole picture. What was the leadership thinking when this or that event happened? What did they know? It is always either second hand information, or the facts are unobtainable.<br />In this magnum opus, a leader, privy to all the decisions and military secrets, tells the whole story in first person singular.<br />The special relationship between himself (former Naval Person) and the American President FDR, is illustrated in a series of letters that appear throughout the work, and offer an insightful window on President Roosevelt's mind and intentions, that were at the time hidden from U.S. public opinion, and, to this day, mostly unknown.<br />Personal anecdotes, written with outstanding wit, bring the Prime Minister down to a human level, joining the statesman with the artist and the hedonist who, on being offered to \\"have some drinks\\" by Stalin responds \\"I am always in favor of such a policy\\"<br />If all of the above wasn't enough, the writing is of such quality and clarity, that I would recommnend it, if only for the delectation on the proper use of the English language.<br />Be warned however, reading of this book may cause uncontrollable purchases of Sir Winston's other works, ...	2003-03-22

Well documented, it ilustrates how the media, in particular the TV stations and CNN distort the news, in favor of the left. More to the point, it explains quite well how they remain blissfully ignorant of the fact. By using as a reference for center a publication that is quite left of the majority of the country, by definition, anything to the right of that publication becomes extreme right.<br />The fact that the paper in question, supports each and every item in the liberal agenda, while condemning each and every item in the conservative one, seems lost on the journalists who are awed by the prestige of the paper used as a reference.<br />If you see the bias you will like this book. If you don't you probably will not see it even if you read it.	2003-02-20

The writer eloquently warns and is ignored. Then, as the \\"the tocsin sounds\\" He is called upon to come and fix the mess.<br />Any resemblance to events ocurring in the Middle East is not purely coincidental.<br />This books and the 5 following are the only history of the war written by an involved head of state, and a Nobel Literature prize winner to boot.<br />Buy, read and ponder.	2003-02-20

The few visionaries who realized what was happening and how to correct the stagnation. Among them Kamal Attaturk, founder of modern Turkey features prominently.<br />The end message to me is that because Christianity is considered a religion, in an area where religious abuses had been common, the first thing that happened, when the humanistic revolutions occurred ( The renaissance first,and the French revolution second)was that religion a.k.a church and state separated.<br />Islam on the other hand is more expansive than Christianity, and its domain extends beyond religious observance, and into civil law and governance; the Sharia. There is no real distinction in Islam between the religious and the civil spheres. A moslem traveler, visiting England wonders at a people who, not having a god given body of law, have to make their own laws, and elect Parliament to do so.<br />Western civilization and law, based generally on reason, is compared to Islamic civilization and law, based primarily on revelation the Quran.<br />All in all a very instructive book that ilustrates the differences between the outlook of both Civilizations.	2002-08-10
