US	51177871	R102DBCSDYSFRX	0670031720	28976631	Drop City	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Drop in to Drop City	All you ever wanted to know about hippies and communal living in is this hefty novel, which despite some tedious passages, is overall a good, engrossing read. Drop City California, a sloppy farm full of sloppy buildings and free-lovin' hippies is forced to move when its founder, Norm Sender, runs into various troubles with the authorities. The hippies pile into a school bus bound for Alaska, the last American frontier, where they believe they'll be able to do their own thing, live off the land and life will be groovy.<br />Of course, the cold, inhospitable wilderness of Alaska doesn't prove to be so welcoming, and group tensions that were simmering in California quickly boil over, and some of Drop City's residents drop out or part ways. The story is mostly told through the viewpoints of lovely, idealistic Star, her sleazy ex-boyfriend Ronnie, and Marco, Star's new, improved man. We also see Alaska from the perspective of locals Cecil and Pamela Harper, whose newlywed lives get a little jolt with the influx of hippies.<br />Drop City is a  fascinating study of group dynamics, societal dropouts and wilderness survival. My only complaint was that there seemed to be so many characters it was often hard to keep track of them all, and the multiple perspectives kept me from being able to really get to know any one character very well.	2003-05-08

The teenager in question is Theresa, a beautiful girl beloved by animals and children alike. Amazingly perspicacious for a teen, Theresa takes us through a summer on Long Island where she cares for her younger cousin, Daisy, the daughter of a semi-famous painter, Flora, and a host of other neighborhood kids and animals.<br />Overall, Child of My Heart seemed more a series of observations and daily happenings than a plotted story. Yet it was oddly compelling, perhaps because McDermott is such a gifted writer. But I did have some problems with Theresas character: even though she seemed so beyond her years in many respects, she was still very childlike  she had no friends her age (only younger) and expressed no interest in boys (save for her creepy relationship with the geriatric painter). And that relationship was rather inexplicable  she never expresses any sexual longing or attraction to this man, but still she gets naked with the old geezer (yuck!), despite being keenly aware of her beauty and that she could probably have any man she wanted. I guess I just felt like something was missing here, but Im not sure what.	2003-05-07

Because reading The Whores Child makes you want MORE.  All of these stories are written with Russos subtle combination of humor and pathos, which imbues them with a nostalgic, bittersweet feel. Like much of his fiction, most of the stories in this book take place in small towns with small-town (but not small-minded) characters as the central focus. From the nun who tries her hand at writing a memoir of her lonely life to the mother and son who take a harrowing cross-country journey, each story pulls you in and leaves you anxiously awaiting another novel as great as Empire Falls.	2003-05-07

This is NOT a quick read; it is a literary novel that you can either tire of or admire (or in my case, both). As in many literary novels, there are many reflective passages that do little to move the story forward or tie up loose ends in the plot.<br />The story focuses on the McLeod family, a Scottish clan from which the eldest son, Fenno, has departed for NYC, only to return after the death of his mother, Maureen, and several years later his father, Paul. Theres a lot of back stories to learn about Fenno and his younger twin brothers, David and Dennis, as well as the secret life of Maureen, and later Paul, who moved to Greece after his wifes death. Theres also Fern, a young woman Paul meets and develops a crush on during his first trip to Greece, and who resurfaces in the books last section. Needless to say, theres a lot going on here, and much of our information comes from Fennos perspective, and he is not the most likeable character. <br />Criticisms aside, this was an interesting, elegantly written novel thats worth getting through, even though you may feel somewhat shortchanged at the inconclusive end.	2003-04-28

Forty-something Rose Lloyd discovers how quickly the life she built can become disassembled the minute her head is turned. Her husband, Nathan, leaves her for her young assistant, Minty, to whom Rose also loses her job as editor of the books page of a big newspaper. <br />Throughout the novel, Rose reflects on her life with Nathan and their two (now grown) children, Sam and Poppy, as she struggles to find a way to make sense of things. There is no actual act of revenge as the title would have you believe; it's rather more a case of \\"living well is the best revenge,\\" as Rose finally pulls herself together and resolves to get on with life without Nathan. Conversely, as Rose becomes stronger, Nathan starts to crumble under the pressures of living with a driven younger woman. Thus, Rose does indeed get some form of revenge, but she is always quite gracious about it, even having a few civilized conversations with Minty throughout the book.<br />Buchan is really a lovely, literary novelist who writes with warmth and introspection, and this, in my opinion, makes \\"Revenge\\" stand out a bit from other Brit chick lit.	2003-04-22

There's young, impressionable Birdie, who becomes a dysfunctional drunk unable to raise Charlie and Jody, her two kids, when Ken leaves her for a college student. And then we have Joan, a savvy single woman who somehow succumbs to Ken's charms and stays married to him until she dies of breast cancer. Lastly, there's Dinah, who used to baby sit for Jody and Charlie. <br />The stories of these women seemed to flow so effortlessly; the wives were very well drawn characters. That said, there was a major flaw:  Mr. Kimble himself. There was no back story, no explanation of why he was so disconnected and unfeeling, or exactly what about him was so irresistible to women, particularly intelligent ones like Joan and Dinah. Kimble remains as enigmatic to the reader as he does to the women he marries. He seems like such a blank character that it is hard to imagine anyone falling for him. Very rarely did I see any qualities that would endear him to women, or keep them standing loyally by him.<br />It was all rather depressing, really, to think these women loved this man and he was so cold and distant and unknowable, especially to his children. It was nice, at the end of the book, to see that at least one Mrs. Kimble and Mr. Kimble's children, had finally found a little happiness.	2003-04-17

I didn't find Mattie a particularly sympathetic character - sometimes I wished I could reach into the book and give her a good shake; she's always on the verge of coming unglued at the hinges.<br />Mattie falls in love with Daniel, who was supposed to be an exterminator but couldn't bear to rid her house of the rats infesting its walls, but Daniel is married. Her two children, Ella and Harry, have problems - the former gnaws habitually on her flesh and the latter is a hostile weirdo. To top it off, Isa, her mom, is going crazy. Mattie leans on her closest friend Angela, a lesbian who has moved south to be with her lover, her brother Al, and God. <br />Along with the typical craziness of being a single mom raising young children, Mattie and Al come to discover their late father had a big secret. And the harbinger of this secret comes in the form of a little rubber blue shoe that was found in her Dad's old car. Mattie becomes attached to the little shoe, carrying it around, using it like a rabbit's foot, until she discovers who the real owner is. The explanation of her father's secret life felt hurried and not fully fleshed out. I felt that way about much of this book. It sort of drifted and meandered, not really sure of what it wanted to say. Lamott thanks an awful lot of people in the acknowledgements for helping her get this book out. Maybe it was a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth.	2003-04-15

Manon is truly a product of her time and place (antebellum Louisiana) and if you're looking for warm and fuzzy, you won't find it in Manon's attitudes toward slavery - more specifically, her attitude toward her own \\"property,\\" Sarah, a slave that was a gift to her when she married her husband, and who has a child by her husband, something Manon has been unable (and unwilling) to provide.<br />This is truly a fascinating glimpse into this time period.  Martin's writing really transports you. Manon is a bright, headstrong character, and despite her prejudices, you can't help but admire her moxie. She handles everything - from a slave revolt to the death of her mother - in a detached but determined fashion. My only complaint:  it should have been longer! I felt cheated not being able to follow Manon further into the future.	2003-04-01

Light and sweet, not too much different than your average romance novel, but with a little more spark and substance. Normally, I tend to take a cynical bent on books like this, but it was such a pleasure to read, I set my cynic aside for the entire novel.<br />Thirty-three year old Lucy finds a new life for herself when her husband (whom she did not love) of fourteen years dies unexpectedly. She is unencumbered and free to make her life over. She moves back to her hometown and immediately becomes captivated by heartthrob country singer/carpenter Ash Farrell. Their relationship takes on the fun spar and parry that leads to the inevitable moment when they FINALLY get in bed together, beginning Lucy's sexual awakening. These love scenes are just juicy enough to give new meaning to Lucy's \\"second coming\\" (wink, wink).<br />For a first novel, this was so smooth and well-paced - there wasn't a hang-up in the whole book. A great escape novel that'll make you want to go out and find your own honky-tonk handyman.	2003-03-21

After the interview, Clementine has plans to retire from movie star journalism and live with her stable, steady boyfriend Ned on his farm in Virginia.<br />But her plans go awry when Allegra crashes the car they're driving in - Clementine winds up in the hospital minus an eye, and Allegra disappears. Instead of going to Virginia to mend, Clementine becomes wrapped up in Allegra's disappearance and southern California culture, attending vigils and having one night stands with TV sitcom stars. Meanwhile, she's getting visits from yesterday's silver screen sirens - Myrna Loy, Loretta Young and Gloria Swanson, just to name a few.<br />Sherrill really seems to know this territory - stars and the culture of fame - and she writes very believably and farcically about it. Mostly, I found this to be an enjoyable read about the cult of celebrity, but after a while I grew tired of her \\"encounters\\" with dead movie stars; it was just kind of annoying quirk that didn't really move the story along. And if you're not familiar with old movies, you may have no idea who most of these women are. But the back of the book does include a cheeky \\"filmography\\" that offers a brief synopsis and critique of the movies mentioned throughout.	2003-03-20

What an original tale, what an amazing writer. To tackle something like rape and murder from the viewpoint of the 14-year-old victim and make it work. Not only work, but soar. <br />Weve all probably read stories about a family trying to pull things back together after the loss of one of its own. But weve never heard it from the deads perspective. And what a perspective! Susie Salmon, the deceased in question, hovers over her remaining parents and siblings and watches as they come to grips (or fail to) with her violent demise. A poignant, heart-wrenching situation is made more so by being told from Susies perspective. We feel her loneliness and alienation just as acutely as we feel that of her familys. This book seems to cover the specter of human emotions. It says so much about sudden loss, about going on with your life and about the importance of family. It is simultaneously spiritual and grounded in reality. <br />Having said all this, the only part that really didnt work for me was when Susies soul briefly comes back to earth by inhabiting the body of a friend for the purpose of making love with her junior high school boyfriend. This was a tad implausible and unnecessary. Overall, though, the book worked. And it wasnt as depressing as you might imagine. In fact, its almost hopeful.	2003-03-13

Is it possible to say I liked such a book? Can you like a book that frightens you, challenges you and makes you fearful of modern America? I was riveted-maybe that's a more apt description. Sebold's writing is captivating, as is the story of the aftermath of the rape, including her attempt to prosecute the rapist. <br />Lucky mostly deals with the very complicated business of getting on with your life after such a life-changing event. How do you act after a rape? How do people treat you? These are some the questions Sebold answers, and they are not easy answers. At the end of the book, you don't get the feeling that she's \\"over it,\\"-not by a long shot, but you do get the feeling that there is hope. So you won't finish this book feeling totally despondent and helpless, but you won't exactly feel good.	2003-03-10

Well, there are a few new tricks this old dog can learn (such as some very intersting hand techniques), and it's fun to give them a try on your unsuspecting partner, but some of the descriptions of said techniques seem so convoluted that I felt like I should have the book open beside me while I was executing them (I did NOT give into this temptation, though). I thought some of the drawings were a bit hard to follow--perhaps a video would be better? <br />There's a good bit of information on safe sex and STD's, pages I thought could've been better used by adding some illustrative photos.

Cal Stephanides, the girl in question, was never really a girlshe was merely misdiagnosed at birth. We follow her life from birth to middle-age, as well as the journey of her conception. And to understand the events leading up to that, Eugenides treats us to the incestuous history of the Stephanides clan, spanning from Greece at the beginning of the 20th century to modern-day San Francisco and Detroit. <br />Such an elaborate story would seem a daunting read, and I did initially find that to be the case; the first hundred or so pages were a little taxing to get through, especially deciphering the Greek tangle of familial relations. But Im glad I stuck it out because this was such an absorbing tale, told with grace and a surprising amount of wit. The characters are thoroughly developed (except, perhaps, for modern day Cal, who I wouldve liked to hear a little more about), and Eugenides moves them deftly through the decadesthrough many major events in American history like the Depression and the race riots in Detroit. <br />His descriptions of the emotional angst Cal endures throughout a sexually ambiguous adolescence and the subsequent discovery of his biology are SO well done. I was also amazed by the detailed history of hermaphrodites Eugenides includes. Really, I cant express my awe enough for this book.	2003-03-05

Noble Norfleet, however compelling, was not his best. It failed to deliver on several levels, despite a strong premise: young Noble set adrift in the world after the death of his siblings by his crazy mother's hand. <br />There were many allusions to the spiritual world; Noble has several strange visions throughout the course of the story that the reader is left to decipher-is he psychic? Or just clinically depressed? Then, there is his \\"worship\\" of women. He really, really wants to devour their, uh, \\"essence.\\" Of course, this must be related to his strange relationship with his batty mother, who has been institutionalized but still plays a pivotal role in Noble's life. She makes many cryptic remarks about Noble's destiny throughout the book, but they remain cryptic. In fact, the latter is a good word to sum up this book. The book, like all books, had to end, but it just felt so unfinished. It felt like Price had meandered too much off track and didn't know how to get back on again, so he just hurried up and slapped together an ending. Noble was an interesting character, and so were many of the \\"fine women he had the pleasure to know,\\" (he talks a lot like this throughout the novel), but overall, there was no real cohesiveness. My reaction, upon turning the last page, was \\"Huh? What was that all about?\\"  But an interesting muddle, overall.	2003-03-04

We follow the band as they travel from dive to dive, losing members, gaining members and finding their groove. <br />Since Jesse is the narrator, the focus is mainly on him: his relationship with his formerly abusive, alcoholic father, his crush on Estelle, the band's new lead singer and his attempts to sort out his post-adolescent angst regarding family, women and music. The other band members don't feature too prominently and aren't very well-developed, although the book would have been more interesting if they were. Nor did Bell delve too deeply in Jesse's past relationship with his dad. There's also a little \\"surprise\\" relationship involving Estelle and Jesse's dad, but unless you're really thick, it won't come as much of a shock.<br />It seemed to me that something was missing from this story. Maybe it was the shallowness of the characters, maybe it was the meandering nature of the novel; there was no real plot, just a succession of gigs at roadhouses up and down the East coast. It was, however, a convincing depiction of life with a bar band, and that managed to hold my interest enough until the rather lackluster ending.	2003-02-27

Either Harper endured a similar experience herself, or she is an extremely gifted fiction writer (I guess both are possible, actually), because the struggle between mother and daughter is so real. The feelings Jeanne expresses are so intense. This is a train of thought novel, almost like Jeanne's private journal. It deals with being middle-aged and alone, family relationships-particularly Jeanne's relationships with her son, Rad, and her ex-husband, Larry-and learning to come to terms with the ravages of Alzheimer's. This was a really instructive read, for me, as my grandmother had Alzheimer's, and it helped me better understand what my own mother must have dealt with.

However, Shreve writes it so compellingly, the story feels fresh. Fifteen year old Olympia Biddeford, a privileged New Englander, finds passion with middle-aged physician John Haskell. They are so darn in love that they recklessly plunder forth in their affair, consequences be damned. And there are consequences-Haskell's wife discovers their affair in a most unpleasant manner, the Biddefords must retreat from high society, and Olympia (not surprisingly) becomes pregnant with a boy who is taken from her as soon as he is born.<br />After being confined for several months, Olympia is sent to a women's school from which she eventually escapes to return to the cottage in the coastal town of Fortune's Rocks, where her passionate affair began. Everything is different now-there is no John Haskell and Olympia is utterly unmoored without family or friends. She attempts to build a life for herself in the cottage, and in the process learns of her now three-year old son's whereabouts. She stakes out the boy's family home until she sees him and then decides what it is she must do-go to court to fight to gain custody of her son. <br />The court scenes are remarkably well-written; Shreve must have done a lot of research to make them so convincing. I had a hard time, however, not peeking ahead to find out the verdict. The ending, as you might expect from Shreve, is not exactly a happy one, but somewhat bittersweet	2003-02-19

She grows to love him in her own weird, tacit way. She also loves David, who becomes even more devoted to the mysterious Rachel after his near-death experience in a burning barn. There are some more neighborhood characters thrown into the mix, but you get to know these three the best.

I also had mixed feelings about this book, but that's where the similarities ended, since the two are vastly different. In fact, the only thing they really had in common was a man named Schmidt trying to find his place in the world after the death of his wife.<br />Begley's book is much more literary than I expected. He has a real love for looooong sentences, lots of commas and dashes; by the time I got to the end of some of them I had to go back and re-read the beginning to make sense of it. The characters in the movie were characitures-silly and rather unbelievable-but the ones in the book are real, mostly educated people. <br />The story, quite obviously, centers on Albert Schmidt, a retired lawyer who faces an empty future with a dead wife and a distant daughter. The relationship between Schmidt and his daughter, Charlotte, is inexplicably strained, and although Schmidt makes attempts to remedy the awkwardness between them, it is never really resolved. He is a man without connections-most of his old friends belonged to his wife, and now he is pretty much alone. So he picks up with Carrie, a 20-year-old waitress at the local café, and proceeds to have a white-hot sexual relationship with her. I had a hard time buying this, but it doesn't surprise me coming from a middle-aged author. Carrie has some baggage of her own, including a boyfriend and a previous lover (a high school teacher, Mr. Wilson, who is now crazy and begins semi-stalking Schmidt).<br />Schmidt is actually a pretty likeable character, he has plenty of flaws and recognizes them, and he seems so adrift and alone you find yourself hoping that he'll make out all right. His case is bolstered by the supporting characters-Charlotte, her fiancée and future in-laws-all of whom are pretty unlikable.	2003-02-07

This was a romance and a tale of small town America with a little bit of mystery thrown in.<br />At the heart of the story is a love triangle between old friends Steven Turner, Jack Lambeau, and Jack's wife, Anne. Jack becomes singularly focused on becoming Lakeland's redeemer through revitalizing the town's lakefront district, so focused that he neglects Anne. She seeks solace in the arms of Turner. A good love triangle can take up an entire novel, but Barbash throws in some other drama as well -- illegal toxic waste dumping. Taking part in the dumping is Jack's brother, Harris, who has some drama of his own going on -- his wife Marla just had their baby, and since he hasn't been much of a husband, Marla doesn't want him around.  <br />Barbash has created some really complex, likeable characters. You'll find yourself rooting for all of them (except Anne, maybe -- I thought she was really stringing these two guys along). The really satisfying thing about this book is, unlike so much modern fiction, that the ending doesn't leave you in complete despair. Not to say that things work out perfectly, but you're left with some hope at the end, and that's always a good feeling to have when you turn the last page.	2003-02-04

I wish I could write like that about my dogs. It truly moved me, especially his account of life with his two big yellow labs, Stanley and Julius. To consider your dogs like that, to write about them so lovingly and thoroughly, it's such a great tribute to them that they, unfortunately, will never know about. To go from such tranquil animals as big, lazy labs to hyperkinetic dogs as border collies is no easy feat. I couldn't do it. Certainly, after reading about border collies I know that they are not suited to my temperament. But I admire Katz for taking on that challenge.<br />One of the most moving parts for me was the description of Stanley's euthanasia. I couldn't agree with his philosophy more and I will do the same for my dogs when it is their time to go (tearing up just thinking about this). For a dog not to be able to run, play to just be a dog and enjoy his quintessential dogness is just no life. I can't imagine not having dogs in my life-this book reaffirmed that.	2003-01-29

But when reading becomes more work than pleasure I feel it's time to throw in the towel. <br />I was a big fan of Tartt's &quot;The Secret History,&quot; so I was really looking forward to a strong follow-up novel. In many ways, this IS a strong novel--Tartt gets very deep into each character and there is not a detail she glosses over--perhaps those are two of the reasons I found this such a tedious read. It starts off promising--dark, descriptive and full of mystery, but it seems that the mystery will take forever to unravel, and I just got so bogged down in the details I didn't care anymore.<br />Maybe I'm just a dilettante, but I felt like there was WAY too much information in this novel, and rather than enhance the plot, it weighed it down and prevented me from making it to the book's end.	2003-01-27

Father Jeremiah, 11-year old asthmatic Rueben and his younger, child-prodigy sister Swede set out across the harsh winter landscape of the American west to find Davy, the eldest brother, who is on the lamb after breaking out of jail for shooting and killing two local reprobates when they break into the Land home.<br />Enger has a beautiful and unique way of telling this story, even if the story itself is rather implausible in some ways. But remember, it IS fiction, so he can make Jeremiah Land a miracle worker if he wants. Swede, too, is a bit on the unbelievable side with her stunning vocabulary, impeccable memory and rapacious interest in the Wild West. I did find Rueben to be a very convincing character, and Davy too, although we never really get to know too much about Davy (what with him being a fugitive).<br />Jeremiah may seem too much of a Christ-like figure to be believed, too, but he was a strong character nonetheless, and I wanted to believe that he was capable of performing miracles, as we all would probably like to believe that miracles can indeed happen during the course of our mundane lives. <br />There was only fleeting mention made of the children's mother, and I thought this was somewhat problematic-Rueben never really mentions her nor do the children seem to make an issue out of not having a mother. However, when Roxanna (a mother figure herself), comes into their lives, they do accept her willingly and eagerly. <br />Overall, I found this to be an inspiring, spiritual tale that made me wish miracles were more prevalent in this ordinary world or that I knew someone like Jeremiah land who could make them happen.	2003-01-15

Part of me found both of these things vaguely irritating from time to time, like I wanted to shake the book and yell, \\"Just spit it out already-nobody talks like this!\\" But perhaps this is precisely the way people of a certain upbringing conduct themselves.<br />The story revolves around brothers Spencer and Gabriel Gibbs, Spencer in his late 20's, Gabriel 10 years his junior. Gabriel has been expelled from his chi-chi private school and comes to live with his brother. He also comes, over the course of a summer, to be infatuated with the mysterious Lillian Dawes, a woman who seems to leave all men trembling in her wake, as she possesses that ineffable \\"certain something.\\" It is really a tale of Gabriel's coming of age in 1950's New York City. He is a likeable young character, as is his brother, despite their pretensions. Lillian, however, remains rather aloof and unknown throughout the novel, but part of the mystery surrounding her eventually gets unraveled (and if you area halfway intelligent person you will figure it out before Gabriel finally does.)<br />Overall, an enjoyable read. Maybe I was initially resistant to the way Mosby writes because so few people write like that these days. I had to keep a dictionary handy, though, for some of the vocabulary words.	2003-01-08

When I turned the last page of this book, I was really crying. I think anyone who has had a loss in their life will have a similar reaction. <br />Gladys is the one with the emotional armor that her sister Ivy can't seem to make a chink in. It's frustrating to see how cold Gladys can be to Ivy and to others that love her, but you understand why she is the way she is a few chapters into the novel. This book really made me think about my life--how it's never too late to change it and how the tragedies and losses we experience profoundly shape our lives.	2003-01-06

Chocolat had a magical, fairytale quality about it that Coastliners fails to pick up on. Like Chocolat, it is the story of an outsider coming into an insular small town and turning the world of its residents upside down. Unlike Chocolat, the main character (Madeline) is actually returning to the place where she grew up. <br />I skipped through many descriptions of the little island featured in this story. How much is there to say about an island that you can walk across in one hour? I also found the characters tiresome and irritatingly quirky--some of them were downright unlikeable. Madeline's father was a man who communicated with grunts and mutterings--why she came back to the island for this troglodyte I do not understand. The novel has a rather soap-operaish quality to it, with all sorts of family secrets being revealed. But I had such a hard time getting through it that when the secrets were revealed, I really didn't care.	2003-01-06

This is one of those books that will have you thinking about its characters long after you've finished reading it. Kathryn and Christy became so real to me, their friendship so alive and dynamic, that it's hard for me to believe they didn't really exisit.<br />The unlikely friendship forged between Christy, a 14 year old coming of age during a hot Baltimore summer and Kathryn, a beautiful 23 year old stricken with polio in her teens, is so poignantly rendered. The characters are so complete! Their exchanges are witty and wonderful. Okay, I'm gushing. But this book affected me pretty deeply. It's rare to read a book that makes you laugh, cry and ponder the nature and the mystery of human relationships. I wish there could be a sequel that follows Christy throughout his adult life (there is a very brief epilogue dealing with this, but it was too brief for me).<br />The relationship between Christy and his family (particularly his father) is also an important part of the story--how his father's actions shape Christy's perceptions of the world, how Christy grows to understand a bit better the complexities of adulthood. There is also some wonderful interaction between Christy and his sister Sue after she is raped by the neighborhood good guy.<br />Maybe some people will find this book too tame or lacking in action. But to me, it was a wonderful \\"slice of life\\" kind of novel about how what appears to be an ordinary summer can actually turn into extaoridinary, life-altering experience.	2002-12-17

Do you have a friend that you turn to when you need advice about important life decisions? &quot;All is Vanity&quot; will make you think twice before doing so next time.<br />Since I am nearing my mid-thirties, I could really relate to this tale of two friends whose situations are very different, but also alike in that they are struggling to define themselves, to move upward and onward to better things, to a better quality of life. <br />Margaret, a struggling novelist, uses her old friend Letty, a trusting housewife, to do this. As Letty and her husband struggle to build a better life for themselves, Margaret uses their struggle (and even encourages further struggling) as fodder for her novel. Needless to say, the result is not a happy one. <br />This novel really kept me engrossed as I read to see how far Margaret would go to advance her art. However, I think some further character development of Letty, Letty's husband Michael and Margaret's husband Ted could have made this story a little better. But overall, this was an impressive follow-up to Drowning Ruth--a very different story but with the same darkness underneath.	2002-12-06

I'm typically a fan of Southern fiction, but this was just too down-homey to be believed.

I swan, you just cain't believe how wonderful everything turns out for this menopausal matron.<br />I skipped many a passage in this book to come to the rather bland end.

Dealing with marriage, fatherhood, life and death, it runs the gamut of emotions. There are some funny moments, but it is not quite the same hip glibness you'll find in Nick Hornby's \\"About a Boy.\\"<br />Really a very touching story of one man's coming to terms with encroaching middle age, single parenthood, and the concept of lasting love. I found Harry's reflections about his relationship with his dad especially poignant. A nice all-around read, very thoughtfully and realistically rendered.	2002-10-16

First, it makes being a stay-at-home mom seem positively loathsome and tremendously unfulfilling (I'm not a mom yet, so I couldn't say whether or not this is true). Second, the fact that heroine Maggie is not married to her man Jake (but has two kids by him)seriously warrants some further exploration and explanation that we never receive. And even though Jake doesn't turn out to be the cad we thought he was, there are still some serious relationship issues that are never resolved.<br />However, I did find this book engaging enough to finish in a few hours, so despite the problems I had with it I still consider it a pretty decent read.	2002-09-03

Ultimately, though, it was a rather sad tale of what happens when you marry someone you don't really know.

I thought I was food obsessed, but this guy takes the cake (no pun intended, because he probably would eschew cake in favor of a big plate of organ meats). He writes about chasing his hearty meals with more than one bottle of wine, craving hotdogs (and indulging that craving) after finishing what he considers a \\"light\\" lunch and the painful gout he surprisingly suffers from. Oh, and there are myriad references to meals with celebrities, from Orson Wells to Russell Crowe. Harrison thinks nothing of dropping hundreds for a good meal, the fond memory of which he thinks justifies the expense. This man is clearly in a much higher socio-economic bracket than myself. <br />That said, the writing is really top notch, if a bit tedious at times. Harrison truly celebrates our gustatory pleasures with abandon. However, I found myself to be quite \\"full\\" of Harrison about three-quarters of the way through the book.	2002-07-03

What it does have is one of the most hysterical descriptions of bad sex I have ever read. \\"It's My F---king Birthday\\" explores exasperating relationships with parents, getting older and staying single, and finding self-contentment. <br />Some reviewers criticize Markoe's writing as lazy, and while I get the distinct impression that this short novel wasn't something she toiled over, that doesn't mean you should enjoy it any less.

However, I stuck with it, and although I didn't acutally LIKE The Corrections, I was unable to put it down.<br />Many of the other reivewers are right--there's not a lot to like about the characters, but Franzen writes them damn well (Enid could be my mother-in-law!) However, I didn't think papa Al was developed enough; I couldn't understand how he became such an emotional ice cube, and at the end of the book, it seems like he was somehow the one solely responsible for all the family's ills. <br />But aside from that, why should this family be so dysfunctional? All the kids had it pretty good, had the standard upper-middle suburban privliges, but none of them could seem to get it together emotionally or financially. <br />Anyway, there's a lot of literary mire to wade through here--little details that you probably won't care about--but it's ultimatley worth the wade. This is a timely, insightful novel that will make you think.	2002-02-26

US	51177871	RTQ4ZWYZX2TWK	0679463127	133893239	The Dearly Departed	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Death lite	This was my first Elinor Lipman book, and compared to the others I've read since then (How Men Act, The Ladies' Man), my least favorite. But obviously, I liked it enough to check out her other stuff, so I certainly think it's worth reading if you're looking for fun, depthless entertainment.<br />Lipman's characters in this book are likeable, if not well developed, and the small town charm appealing. The emotions that Sunny, the main character, goes through in dealing with her mother's death are believable but not often mentioned. Her romance with the town cop is pat but sweet.	2002-02-19

Plot aside, Egan's writing is wonderful-so effortlessly illustrative it's a pure literary delight.<br />The story, featuring the interwoven lives of several characters, is extremely inventive and daring. Even if she didn't succeed in pulling it off (although I feel she did), she deserves kudos for creating such a complex, far-reaching story. Her characterizations are rich and believable, which is no small feat given the number of storylines going on. There are a lot of plot twists and turns, but I was captivated by all of them. A great book to begin the year with!	2002-01-08

This one was hard to get through for some ineffable reason. Maybe something was lost in the translation from Spanish to English, or maybe there were just too many characters and it was too large of a generational saga to fit into a 300 page book-maybe a five or six hundred pager would've given me the depth of character I was looking for, because I just felt unfulfilled when I finished. There are some really gripping moments and the main character, Aurora, seems to be a strong, interesting protagonist on those rare occassions when her personality really comes through.	2001-12-18

I keep this on my coffee table and flip through it when I need some advice about combining different patterns and textures. There are some schemes here I would never have imagined working together, but seeing them on the pages of this beautiful book gives me the courage to be bolder with color and pattern.	2001-12-12

And I think that's why he probably got the job. His cooking, while not revolutionary, is simple and good, but probably wouldn't have attracted a shred of attention if it was prepared by a homely fat guy with acne scars. That said, I enjoy this book very much--it's well photographed, the recipes are explained in detail, and it's practical enough to use on weeknights and impressive enough for special occasions. I'll probably sign on for the next installment.	2001-12-12

The recipes are simple, the results are impressive and the time invested is minimal. That's a pretty great combination for weeknight dinners or when you're entertaining. Although this cookbook is lowfat, I usually end up using a bit more of the fatty igredients (fat=flavor) to taste.	2001-12-12

I wanted some ideas for punching up my pre-made lampshades or maybe creating simple fabric lampshades, but the projects in this book are a bit more convoluted. There are some inspiring lamps and shades, but to make some of them require special materials and skills that would involve more time and effort than I'm willing to spend.	2001-12-12

The tale of the Peppers family was quirky (but realistic) and amusing. Once the book starts zeroing in on Louise and her downward spiral of self-destruction, it gets a little boring--another adolescent angst novel involving substance abuse. The thing is, it's never clear WHY Louise should have so much self-loathing. She comes from a loving family (with a neurotic mother, but who doesn't have one of those?) When her brother dies, her emotional problems increase, but there's not enought to convince me that she should remain so distraught for the rest of the story. <br />This book really jumps around, too, so there isn't a lot of character building. Louise's family is portrayed on a pretty superficial level--I guess they're all supposed to look ridiculous to make us better understand why Louise runs from them. Anway, I did truly enjoy about the first half; the second half loses momentum and the part where Louise wants to be a clown and runs off to join the circus is completely outlandish. But overall, I think it's worth sticking with this book because its good moments are certainly worthwhile.	2001-10-30

Nevertheless, I devoured this is one sitting. Vacuous books by British authors are so much better than those by American authors; I'm not sure if it's because British colloquialisms are so much more clever than American ones, or perhaps the heroines in their books are more likeable and easier to relate to. Whatever the reason, it would be diffucult to dislike this book as long as you're not expecting a classic work of literature and are just looking for some rainy-day escapism.	2001-10-25

Yet, MLBD was a delightful read, laugh-out-loud funny and refreshingly different. Yes, the author is another one of those hip, smarty-pants gen-x types that you would probably want to punch if you met him at a cocktail party, but the whole concept of this psuedo-memoir combined with its quirky, amusing prose makes for an entertaining read.	2001-10-19

But the stuff in this book is a little too elementary, a little too artsy-craftsy and not quite as sophisticated as I'd hoped. Maybe I'm getting to be an old fart (pushing 30), but I found most of these projects better suited for my funkier apartment dwelling days.	2001-10-17

This is straight out of the touchy-feely- quirky small town-love comes a knockin' when you least expect it-Oprah genre. Apparently, these are themes that resound with lots and lots of people. And I'll admit it--I did read the book in its entirety, so it must be somewhat compelling (either that or I'm a masochist, because I did go on to read the sequel, which I REALLY would not recommend). Anyway, if you've read any of Oprah's other small southern town selections, there's no real reason to bother with this one.	2001-10-17

Roomate dies, wanna-be author/Don Juan steals roomate's manuscript and roomate's lover, suspense and hilarity ensue. I don't know where I first heard about this book, but I sure couldn't put it down. It's no great work of literature, but it is clever, entertaining, and fun. A nice escape in these anxiety-ridden times.	2001-10-16

However, I felt like something was missing. Not enough back story about Ethan--he never seemed like a fully developed character, but then again, I guess he was intentionally made a bit of an enigma.This book does make the reader wonder how well she knows her own husband, friends and neighbors.	2001-09-25

Her friendship with starlet-...fairy godmother Maxi is bordering on ridiculous,and her post-partum breakdown is just plain irritating and poorly rendered.  <br />That said, \\"Good in Bed\\" was still a decent read; it pulls you in and won't let you go. For all of its minor irritations, I do think the mark of a good story is one that keeps you reading, and this novel delivers on that score. It's also much more likeable than several of the other vacuous novels spawned by Helen Fielding's \\"Bridget Jones.\\"	2001-09-06

For the first few pages, I thought this was going to be another one of those annoying, angst-filled novels about some over-educated hipster. However, &quot;Lit Life&quot; surprised me by being a little more insightful and poignant than I originally perceived. Surprising too, was the ending, which I expected to be far more pat.<br />This is a breezy little novel that took me a few short hours to read, but I did read it pretty much straight through because I found it quite engaging. The main characters are full and well-developed, and their respective plights absorbing. I particularly enjoyed the insiders' view of the publishing industry--it appears to be a scary place, one that I will not likely visit during my lifetime as a struggling writer.	2001-09-05

This is a rather conventional romantic story that goes on a wee bit too long, but most of the characters are likeable, and the way they drift rather aimlessly through life is pretty realistic. <br />I got the impression that this was the life the author would like to have lived, or perhaps did live in his younger, thinner, hairer youth.	2001-09-05

So ...it's a ... fine screenplay. <br />To me, a good book is one that stays with you when you put it down. Miles Roby, his daughter Tick, Mrs. Whiting, and all the other Empire Falls characters seemed real to me; I found myself thinking about their respective plights every time I had to set the book down, and even now that I've finished it. This novel was the perfect mixture of poignancy and humor. It wasn't pretentious in the least, or over-the-top, like some books by other modern-day male authors....<br />If you can put your cynicism aside, I think you'll be swept away by Empire Falls.	2001-08-15

Ishiguro's Christopher Banks is just such a character. Although he narrates the story, and we follow him through the course of several years, we never really KNOW him. He remains distant, cold, and never fully fleshed out. Therefore, I found it difficult to give myself over to the story and Banks' plight. Banks' romantic interest is equally cold and elusive, and their relationship (or lack thereof) seemed rather empty.<br />The exotic Shanghai setting seems the ideal backdrop for the mystery that unfolds. But the mystery unfolds so damn slowly! There's all this mucking around in the middle of the novel, and then, quite suddenly, we're presented with a hurried conclusion that fails to satisfy. You never really understand on what level the disappearance of Banks' parents affects him. Everyone's emotions, as well as the prose, seemed stilted. Not my cup of tea, old chap.	2001-08-09

Her tales of the cases she's been involved with are truly intriguing and often chilling. However, if you're looking for an inside scoop on the FBI, you certainly won't find it here. DeLong doesn't offer any suprising revelations about the hardships of being a woman in this blue-suit environment, nor does she give her reader any critical analysis of the inner workings of the FBI. But, it is a very entertaining (if unsettling) read. At the end of the book, DeLong offers some tips on lessening your chances of becoming a crime victim, but the overall message of the book seems to be a rather doomed one: crime happens, and it happens to people like you and me for no real reason at all.	2001-08-09

But why oh why did she have to fool with the time period? What may have been shocking left set in the sixties is pretty tame by today's standards. The whole charm of the original &quot;Dolls&quot; was directly related to the period in which it was set. Lawrence's &quot;Shadow&quot; is has nothing new to say, nothing you wouldn't find in any Jackie Collins novel. Stick to the original.	2001-08-02

The descriptions of Myra's lonely life were especially poignant; Berg has made her an extremely sympathetic character, one you are really rooting for. The way the book deals with death was also compelling; maybe it was because I had just been to a funeral the day before, but it really got me thinking about my inevitable demise and the deaths of loved ones. This is not a morbid tale at all, but a bittersweet one.	2001-08-02

After years of travelling, she returns to her native Jamaica to face up to family issues and become reacquainted with the love of her life.<br />There are several interesting story threads, from Ceci's dysfunctional fmaily to her taboo romance with one of Jamaica's prominent leaders.

The central character is largely unlikeable, but by the end of the book, I found myself rooting for Patrick Wallingford to get his woman.
