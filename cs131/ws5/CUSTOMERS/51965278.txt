But, for some reason, she does not believe it should extend to young women--girls.  Or boys, for that matter. <br /> <br />Grace is for ALL.  It is for children, too.  But Denise Glenn promotes a very legalistic environment for children.  No wonder so many adults have difficulty accepting God's grace--they've been trained that there's a punishment around every corner. <br /> <br />If you've read this book or chose to read it, I highly encourage you to also read a copy of Families Where Grace is in Place by VanVonderen.  At least look at another viewpoint.  God said the Kindgom of Heaven belongs to such as these (children).  I don't believe He is pleased when we accept His grace for ourselves but then turn around and deny grace to our children.	2005-07-13

Fugate	Can you imagine Jesus whipping someone until they're broken?  What did Jesus say to the woman at the well?  To the adulterous woman that was about to be stoned?  To the noisy children the disciples tried to shush away?  He welcomed them all. <br /> <br />Too many people think parents have to be authoritarian or permissive, that there's no other way.  There IS another way--it's to treat our children the way God treats us--with love, guidance, teaching, gentleness, and grace.  We are to treat others the way we want to be treated.  I wouldn't treat an animal the way Fugate says to treat children. <br /> <br />Some MUCH better books to read are Biblical Parenting by Crystal Lutton, The Discipline Book by Sears, and Grace Based Parenting by Tim Kimmel.	2005-05-24

For many of us, this is the way we were raised.   <br /> <br />When I was a teacher, I tried to implement Dobson's philosophy to help my students learn socially acceptable behavior.  Time and time again, it failed in the long run.  It often offered a quick fix, but the students would revert back to their unacceptable behavior the minute they left my classroom or whenver there was a substitute teacher in my room.  So, in my opinion, it was a failure.   <br /> <br />After years of teaching, I finally became a parent.  I am so thankful that I found a copy of Christian Parenting & Child Care by Sears & Sears.  It opened my eyes to a more Christ-like parenting style--and I was so excited to change the tone of my household.  After reading that and How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk by Faber & Mazlish, the whole atmosphere in our home changed.

This book is wonderful for the new mother--whether pregnant or having recently given birth.  It is consise and a quick read.  It is so reassuring--written by a mother of 8, who is herself an R.N. and lactation consultant, married to a pediatrician.  Martha Sears describes how her years as a nurse did little to prepare her for her \\"very own baby.\\"  Nothing but time spent with your own newborn will do that!  But, the reassurance of a mother \\"who's been there\\" eight times over is a wonderful thing.  Martha Sears gives new mothers the permission to follow their intuition and spend time loving their new babies.  She gives them leave to ask for help with household tasks and spend a honeymoon with their newborns.  She describes the myriad of emotions new mothers experience.  She presents some cutting-edge research the supports what many mothers have known all along. <br /> <br />A fabulous book!  I highly recommend it!	2005-02-28

Books	5	7	7	N	N	All Parents & Parents-to-be Should Give This Book a Try!	I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this informative, yet quick-reading book.  The authors present some very well-researched as well as anecdotal evidence to support the family bed.  Especially prescious were quotes from children who \\"graduated\\" from the family bed.  The authors are quick to point out, though, that the family bed does not a good parent make!  It is a parenting choice that can only be decided by the parents, themselves.  No one should criticize parents for choosing/not choosing a family bed. <br /> <br />As people who thought sleeping with babies was dangerous and nuts, we are now thrilled to be sharing sleep with our baby and plan to do so with any future children.  Even during the newborn stage, I was never tired during the day and I truly believe it was the result of us all sleeping together.  Our newborn daughter's crying could be described as less than 5 minutes per week--due to our perseverance to respond to her cues and infant communication.   <br /> <br />I'm so happy that there are researchers and doctors who write books like this to help westerners, like us, realize what the rest of the world knows--babies love to be with their parents--it's good for their physical and emotional health, and it makes parenting such a joy! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, even if you've already read other books that discuss infant sleep.	2005-01-30

There is a better way and it is healthier for everyone.  Gary Ezzo starts off his book by stating that if you don't follow his methods, you'll end up with a clingy brat that no one likes.      Well, I know many, many families that did the exact opposite of what he recommends, and they have the most compassionate, kind, loving families I've ever seen.  Ezzo preaches a very restrained love, one that will probably not scar your child for life, but will result in a superficial relationship as your child gets older.    He repeatedly states how other people will say to you, \\"What a good baby you have,\\" if you follow his methods.  Is that what parenting is to Ezzo?  Other people complimenting you on having a \\"good\\" baby?  We do the exact opposite of what Babywise recommends, and we DO get quite a few comments, on how happy and secure our child seems.  He also brags that you'll be able to leave your baby with anyone and just walk out the door.  Again, is that what he thinks parenting is?  Being so distant from your baby the s/he learns not to care if you're there or not?    Please do some research before you do this to yourself and your child.  Read some other books to get other points of view.  Unlike Ezzo, I don't think you're a bad parent if you don't do things \\"my\\" way, but I do hope you'll consider all perspectives.  Some other books to read are Good Nights by Gordon, The Baby Book by Sears, Becoming a Father by Sears, and The Vital Touch by Heller.	2005-01-25

There is a lot of good information in this book.  Mothers are encouraged to \\"room-in\\" with their babies in the hospital and breastfeed their babies on cue, not on a schedule.  The information on how to breastfeed or what to do if you have problems, is sparse, though.  They also recommend that you start the weaning process around 8 months of age, which isn't at all necessary or even part of the AAP guidelines.  You'll need another breastfeeding book to supplement.   <br /> <br />The information on medical issues is pretty good, although, it isn't extensive. <br /> <br />What I really don't like is the one-size-fits-all attitude towards sleep and discipline.  The authors of this book are adamantly against rocking and/or nurisng your baby to sleep.  They write that if you are doing this, you should stop.  Nursing my baby to sleep works well for our family, and I know that there is no medical reason to stop.  If it doesn't work for another family, that's fine.  But, I shudder to think that a mother may stop doing what works well for her and her baby because these authors have the arrogance to tell her she shouldn't.   They also tell you not to rock your child back to sleep if s/he has a nightmare.  Personally, I think that's a parent's choice, not something doctors should dictate.  But, if you can take this book with a shaker of salt, it does have it's good points. <br /> <br />If you live near a Publix Supermarket, you can get this book free by signing up for their Baby Club.  That's how I got mine, and personally I wouldn't spend my money on it.

There are some great recipes for adding more veggies to your diet.  While the recipes aren't super easy, they're not very difficult, either.  As far as the recipes being adapatable for babies, the only comments she makes are to puree some vegetables and grains during the cooking process and set them aside for baby.  Most babies graduate from pureed foods in a matter of weeks and begin to prefer finger foods.  Her information on why to breastfeed and avoid commercial baby foods and supplements is EXCELLENT, however.    For me, the best part of this book was the dessert section.  I have an incurable sweet tooth (that I'm trying to cure).  When I began eating whole foods, I cut WAY back on sweets, but I still crave a treat now and then.  She gives excellent advice on how to convert your favorite dessert recipes to whole foods by substituting bananas, dates, honey, etc. for the sugar and whole-wheat flour for all-purpose flour.  There are also quite a few whole-foods dessert recipes included like cake, cookies, brownies, etc.      The beginning of the book outlines good reasons for switching to whole foods.  Unfortunately, she places too much trust in the \\"food pyramid\\" promoted by the USDA and encourages a low-fat diet.  Many whole foods are naturally high in fat, full of vitamins, and intended to complement the whole foods that are naturally low in fat.  She does write, however, that her book is only a starting point and each family needs to do their own research into the healthiest foods for their family.  An excellent point.    This book is a good addition to your library of whole foods cookbooks, but please don't let it be your only one.  In addition, I recommend \\"Whole Foods for the Whole Family,\\"  \\"Nourishing Traditions,\\" and \\"The Maker's Diet.\\"	2004-09-18

If you are truly busy and want recipes that you can just throw into your slow-cooker, this cookbook does provide that. After my daughter was born, I wanted main dish recipes that would allow me to spend a minimum of time in the kitchen but still have something good for dinner.  <br />  <br /> I ordered this book but was surprised by some of the ingredients. While most of the recipes are quite low in fat, they're not very healthy, at least not by my standards. Several recipes call for &quot;fat-free non-dairy refrigerated creamer&quot; as a thickener. The very idea of putting non-dairy creamer into a main dish repulsed me. Condensed soups, the juice from a pickle jar, and bottled salad dressings are other ingredients used for flavor. The recipe using pickle juice was also just too much for me! I passed that one up.  <br />  <br /> The author seemed to work hard to make recipes that were low in fat but ended up with a lot of processed ingredients. Personally, I'd rather have more natural ingredients, even if they add some fat. Some of the recipes didn't taste homemade--they tasted like they came from a box--hamburger helper style--because of all the processed ingredients. I was really disappointed to serve a home-cooked meal that tasted like it came out of a box. Some recipes weren't really recipes, in my opinion. Chicken cooked in salad dressing, pork cooked in bottled BBQ sauce--you get the idea. If you're new to cooking, however, these ideas may be new to you and you may find them helpful. The author also has a fabulous way to cook vegetables at the same time as your main dish--so you can truly have your whole meal finished in the slow cooker. <br />  <br /> I give the book 4 stars because it lives up to its name--it is great for busy people--and it doesn't claim to be healthy. If you don't mind processed ingredients, you may love this book. If you want more of a natural, whole-foods approach, this isn't the book for you.	2004-08-02

Busy parents can get the same help with feeding their children in a much shorter book.<br />This book focuses heavily on infant feeding, both breast and bottle, as well as starting solids.  As a breastfeeding mom, I found the chapter on breastfeeding to be average.  You're better off with a good breastfeeding book, as you'll need one anyway.  The bottlefeeding information presented is very important, as it is tempting to try and control your child's eating when you use a bottle.  This book helps you avoid that.  There aren't many books on bottlefeeding.  Again, though, the important facts about sharing control with your child while bottlefeeding are in her other books.<br />I highly recommend Ellyn Satter, especially to parents with eating issues that they don't want to pass on to their children.  One of her two other books is a better, more comprehensive read, though.	2004-06-23

When do YOU get a drink?	Your answer probably is, &quot;When I'm hungy, when I'm thirsty.&quot; Babies eat to satisfy thirst as well as hunger. Breastfed babies nurse for comfort and bonding, as well as to satisfy their physical needs. If a guest came into your house and said, &quot;I'm thirsty. May I have something to drink?&quot; You wouldn't dream of saying, &quot;No. Our schedule says beverages are not to be served for another 45 minutes.&quot; If your spouse came up to you and said, &quot;I've had a stressful day. I need a hug.&quot; Would you say no? Yet, that's exactly what this book tells you to do with your tiny baby.      Try to see things from your baby's perspective. I can't imagine being so hungry or thirsty that I had to cry myself to sleep. I also can't imagine feeling all alone, crying in bed, and my husband not coming to comfort and hold me. I would never dream of doing this to a helpless baby, that can't tell time and doesn't understand &quot;five more minutes.&quot;      Treat your baby the way you'd like to be treated. You can't spoil a baby by giving him/her what s/he needs. When your children are older, you can teach them delayed gratification by gently withholding WANTS, not NEEDS.      Talk to your pediatrician about sheduled feedings. You'll find that they lead to dehydration and failure to thrive. Instead of this book, I recommend The Baby Book, by Sears and Sears.	2004-04-21

I was quite skeptical of reading the series of parenting books by the Sears, as &quot;shared sleep&quot; was so foreign to me.  But, having read this and a few of their other books, I am now thoroughly convinced that attachment parenting is a wonderful, beautiful, low-stress way to raise children.  <br />This book covers EVERYTHING you need to know about taking care of an infant, including day-to-day things like bathing, feeding, burping, to major and minor medical situatations.  My husband and I find this book very reassuring when, in the middle of the night, our newborn is acting strange or when we get lots of unasked for advice and we second-guess our parenting.<br />Frankly, I don't understand the criticism that says that the Sears preach an all-or-nothing method that makes parents feel guilty.  The Sears do promote attachment parenting but they don't believe that &quot;sharing sleep&quot; is necessry for every family.  They specifically write that each family is different and has to find what works best for them.  There is an extensive section on how to continue breastfeeding if you are going back to work and how to make formula feeding a positive experience, if you feed with formula.  <br />Give this book a read and form your own opinion.

This book is more technical and the less practical of the two for an expecting woman, but still a valuable resource.  I find it extremely helpful for when people are critical of my choice to pursue a 100% natural birth.  It also could be helpful if your OB is recommending a test or procedure that makes you uneasey.  You can look up the research behind it and make an informed decision.	2004-01-13

In this book, she seems angry and bitter about the sacrifices of mothering.<br />Giving birth and being a mother are the most difficult things I've ever done, but they're also the most rewarding.  I wouldn't trade them for anything.  I'm sure that Iovine loves her children, but what a way to vent!  Not only was this book depressing, but it didn't make me laugh.  I felt sorry for her.  Being a mother certainly has its &quot;moments,&quot; but I go to my &quot;girlfriends&quot; for support and encouragment, not commiseration about how awful it is to be a mother.<br />If you want a good laugh with your girlfriends, go to your real friends, not this book.  You can have a laugh about the unexpected twists and turns your life is taking and still rejoice in the miracle of your young family.	2004-01-09

Humor is definitely needed during pregnancy!  However, the offensive parts outweigh Iovine's humor, at least for me.<br />She is extremely negative about natural childbirth, for starters.  She refers to natural childbirth methods as \\"way too organic\\" and weird.  How you give birth is a personal choice, and natural childbirth may not be for everyone, but I didn't appreciate the repeated digs at the way we hope to give birth to our child.  <br />I was also offended at how she asserts that all husband are totally turned off by their wives while they're pregnant.  I know that some couples struggle with this, but her assumption that they all just turn to the Playboy channel until their wives get their figures back was very offensive to me.  She even made it seem like we shouldn't mind, and maybe be grateful, if this happens.<br />I would've loved this book if it hadn't been for items like these.  If you're considering or planning a natural birth and/or your husband loves your body regardless of how it looks right now, skip this book.  If you're planning a medicated birth and/or think it's kind of cute when your husband turns to pornography instead of you, this book is right up your alley.	2004-01-09

I have very high expectations for a book that calls itself \\"complete\\" right in the title.  In addition, on the front of the jacket, it says, \\"This unique and authoritative guide covers all aspects of pregnancy & baby care through age one . . . \\"  So, I have a higher standard for this book than for other pregnancy/parenting books that address specific philosophies or issues.<br />This very large book has a lot of information about pregnancy, childcare, and parenting.  Many of the common issues are addressed, in addition to some not found in many such books.  <br />There is a section on the special needs of families who adopt, often skimmed over in many pregnancy books.  There also are sections on families who experience miscarriage, stillbirth, and death of an infant or young child.  While not topics that people enjoy reading, they certainly need to be addressed so that people who experience them don't feel alone and know there are resources to help them.  They also include things NOT to say to people who experience the death of a child (like \\"You can always have more,\\") and things you can say and do that could actually help the family in the healing process.<br />There is quite a bit of information in this book that is out of date, however.  Nothing is mentioned about the dangers of eating certain fish while pregnant/nursing.  Homebirth is not even in the index, you need to look up \\"hospitals--back-up arrangements.\\"  This is despite that fact that studies endorsed by the Center for Disease Control (among others) find that homebirth is a viable choice for low-risk pregnancies when a skilled midwife is present.  There is some information about alternatives to the \\"medical model\\" of pregnancy and childbirth, but not enough for the authors to call this book an \\"authoritative guide [that] covers all aspects of pregnancy.\\"<br />I, personally, was disappointed in the section titled, \\"Returning to Work.\\"  Firstly, because there is no complementary section on stay-at-home moms/dads or even a section on deciding whether or not to return to work.  For many families, the decision of whether or not one parent will stay home with the children is a big one.  There are many factors to consider, resources available, and ways to make it financially possible.  It bothers me that this book assumes that all mothers and fathers will return to work within the first year.  While families who choose to have both parents work need support and resources, families who are undecided or who decide to have someone at home need support and resources also.  The subsection \\"Handling Guilt Feelings\\" (about working outside the home) does not even mention that fact that you may want to consider whether working outside the home is right for your family.  There certainly are parenting books out there specifically designed for \\"stay home\\" parents and others for \\"working\\" parents.  In my opinion, a book that claims to be an \\"authoritative guide\\" should offer resources for both.<br />This book has good points.  However, right on the jacket, it calls itself an \\"authoritative guide,\\" as I referenced earlier.  Since it is lacking information on many important issues, however, I cannot recommend it, (...) and supplement it with additional resources.	2003-08-09

So many people rave about this book, and I can't figure out why.  I checked many pregnancy books out at the library before deciding which ones I wanted to purchase.  I am REALLY glad I didn't just go out and buy this one.<br />It is quite basic, and if you're ignorant about the basics of how your body works during pregnancy (nothing to be ashamed of) you may find this book informative.  It is arranged in a month-by-month format.  It has descriptions of your baby at each month as well as how you may look and feel.  It also describes what to &quot;expect&quot; at each prenatal visit with your doctor/midwife, which is one of my complaints.<br />I particularly disapprove of how this book sets up parents to accept whatever their caregiver (doctor or midwife) tells them, rather than to be informed consumers who exercise informed consent and informed dissent of obstetric interventions.  If you read other books, especially with statistics on how high infant mortality is in the U.S., you'll realize that many labor and birth complications are iatrogenic--caused by the doctor &quot;doing something&quot; when s/he should've just waited for the mother's body to do its work.  <br />The tests and procedures available to pregnant women are described as routine and necessary, and there is practically no discussion about why you might refuse them.<br />I did read the book in its entirety, and it was fun to look at drawings of what my baby may look like at various stages.  I think their eating plan is wise and within reason (I believe MANY health problems in the U.S. are caused by poor eating habits).  I'm surprised that so many women are unwilling to even attempt to improve their diet while pregnant.  The authors do provide good rationale for a healthy diet and allow some wiggle room for treats and cravings.<br />Overall, if you're looking for the type of birth your mother had and want birth to be something that happens to you rather than something you do, you might like this book.If you're looking for an alternative, check out &quot;The Birth Book&quot; by Sears, and books by Sheilia Kitzinger, Penny Simkin, and Susan McCutcheon.	2003-08-08

I only gave it 4 stars, though,  because it doesn't have enough information on natural childbirth, completely unmedicated.  If you're planning a natural birth (rather than a managed delivery), you'll need and want additional resources.<br />I did find the tables listing various interventions with their benefits and risks very helpful.  Penny Simpkin is extremely knowledgeable about pregnancy and birth.  You should check out her other books as well, especially &quot;The Birth Partner.&quot;  My husband is totally engrossed with that book.	2003-08-08

The book is filled with examples of women who chose epidurals and other intervention and had satisfying births.<br /><br />The overwhelming theme in this book is that it is the expectant parents' responsibility to educate themselves about their choices in childbirth, discuss their wishes with their caregiver, and write a birth plan to help convey these wishes to hospital staff (if they chose hospital birth).  The Sears believe that if the parents are the ones making the informed decisions, rather than having decisions made for them, they will have a joyful, beautiful start to their family.<br /><br />The Sears clearly lay out the benefits of natural childbirth, and do discuss in detail the risks of the various tests and interventions, as well as when they are justified.  My favorite part is in the back, where mothers and fathers have submitted their birth stories.  It is wonderful to read first-hand accounts of the emotions and sensations of birth.  As I said, all kinds of births are included:  planned C-sections, home births, epidurals, birth centers, high risk, etc.  What is emphasized is that when the parents are informed and able to make their own choices, they are at peace with the outcome.  It is when the parents feel that their wishes were not respected or that risks and options were not explained to them that they feel angry and bitter at their caregivers.<br /><br />This is a great read for parents who know they want natural childbirth and for parents who want to consider it.  You will never regret knowing your options.  The birth and the child are your responsibility.  It can be a time of joy and empowerment or a time of fear and helplessness.  Having those choices, wouldn't you choose the former?	2003-08-04

She has done extensive research into the birth rituals and practices of many cultures.  While she is critical of the overuse of interventions in American births, she openly acknowledges that they can be a wonderful blessing in saving the lives of mothers and babies in emergency situations.<br />When I first got this book, I just paged through and looked at all the pictures and quotes.  They way the book is printed (double-spaced on wide, glossy pages) makes it a little difficult to read, for me anyway.  After a few days, I started reading it from the beginning and am enjoying it so much I'll forgive the printing style.  <br />A great book for mothers who are relishing this profound, defining time in their lives.  It will inspire you to read more on natural childbirth (if you haven't already) as you begin to realize the power within you to give birth.	2003-08-04

If you are ready to trust your obstetrician and believe that s/he will make the best decisions for you and your baby, you need to read this book.  Goer clearly lays out the pros and cons of various medical practices that are common in the U.S.  She contrasts these with the common practices in other industrialized nations that have better outcomes for mothers and babies.<br />Goer is fair in that she acknowledges that many obstetricians are doing what they believe to be best--they were trained in medical schools and residency programs that view pregnancy as a disease or condition which usually requires intervention.  She also acknowledges that just because you choose a midwife doesn't mean you'll get better care and just because you choose an OB doesn't mean you'll get poor care.  Each practitioner is different and it is up to the &quot;thinking woman&quot; to seek out a caregiver with whom she can work and develop a sense of trust.<br />It is important to know your options.  Few hospital birth classes will give you the real low-down on the side effects and complications associated with epidurals.  Most obstetricians won't recommend you get a second opinion before performing a C-section even though it is major surgery and, more often than not, not a true emergency situation (obviously, in a true emergency, you'll be rushed to the operating room).<br />This book will inspire you to seek out alternatives to the way your were born and many of your friends gave birth.  Family and friends may think you're strange for not wanting to do it the way everyone else does, but that's often the case with pioneers.  This book is not the best for building your skills and confidence for natural birth, but it's a good starting point to help you realize the benefits of natural childbirth.<br />A great book to read along with this is &quot;Husband-Coached Childbirth&quot; by Dr. Bradley and any other books on the Bradley Method.	2003-07-30

Rubinstein validated many of my beliefs that have helped me maintain the learning environment in my classroom.  He also helped me articulate why what I do works to other teachers who say to me, &quot;The kids are so good for you.  They're not good for me!&quot;<br />There's nothing worse than classroom management advice from someone who's &quot;never been in your shoes.&quot;  Rubinstein jumped into teaching middle school in the inner city with hardlly any training.  His students were ruthless.  Five years later, he was voted teacher of the year at his school and his students were successfully mastering their work.  <br />Rubinstein is incredibly humble and lays it all out--his failures, his misguided philosophy of teaching, and his slow and bumpy road to success.  <br />Rubinstein is quite critical of teacher preparation programs.  As someone who went to an excellent university for teacher preparation, I didn't appreciate his knocks on colleges of education, but what he says is true of many certification programs.  I'll forgive him becuase his book is sooooo good.<br />One note, I found the strategies very appropriate for middle and high school teachers.  It may not be as appropriate for primary teachers.  Still, it's hilarious and the philosophies are sound.<br />Buy this book.  If will re-motivate you, rejuvenate you, and excite you about the months and years of teaching ahead of you.	2003-07-30

Experience told me that the tutors had little or no experience tutoring and had absolutely no materials.  The burden was on me to find suitable work for the students to work on while spending time with their tutor.<br />The regular class work was too difficult for the student to complete without my help because they were below grade level (that's why they needed tutoring) and the tutors were often so far removed from pre-algebraic concepts and modern math standards, that they were just as confused by the regular curriculum assignments as the students.  So, I had to create my own materials for the tutors to use.  In my spare time!  <br />This book has a five-page introduction on tutoring in general as well as an overview of the NCTM standards and what is expected at the end of 6th grade.  Then the book is divided into six sections:  Numbers &amp; Computation, Patterns, Geometry, Measurement, Data Analysis, and Problem Solving.  Each section starts with an overview of the concepts to be mastered, ideas for games and other fun activities, then a pre-test, three lessons, then a post-test.  There are four pages of review at the end of the book, followed by the answer keys.<br />This book has relieved much of my anxiety about introducing my students to new tutors.  I plan to give them this book ahead of time, so that they will be well-prepared.  The material in this book will provide the tutor with the background necessary to teach and enough problems and activities to help the students get caught up on their fundamentals.  <br />While this book is geared for sixth grade and I teach seventh and eighth, it is perfect for my students who are below-grade level in their skills.	2003-03-03

I found much in this book that filled in the missing pieces of my understanding of the unwritten rules of this era.  <br />The book is divided into two parts:  the first has more lengthy explanations of various aspects of Victorian society--marriage, the military, class, money, law, parliament, etc.  Diagrams of class rank and period illustrations are helpful.  Quotes from some of the most famous novels of the time are used to illustrate the explanations.  There are brief histories of the monarchs interspersed throughout, as well as some medieval history that explains how many of the customs came to be.  The second half is a dictionary of commom terms you'll come across in novels from the period.  <br />While the editing of this book leaves a little to be desired, it is an enjoyable read and a decent reference.  Serious anglophiles will find it very basic, but the avid novel reader who's history is only &quot;so-so&quot; will find it invaluable.	2003-01-02

If you are a caring teacher, then despite the title, this book is not for you.  You will not find anything new or profound here.
