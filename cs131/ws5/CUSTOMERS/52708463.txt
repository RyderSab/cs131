I liked the allegory and didn't feel it was heavy handed at all. The book is well written and the characters fully fleshed out. But the main reason I liked this novel is because the emotions were realistically portrayed- the villians were evil, the desire between a man and a woman wasn't glossed over, and the violence was appropriate for the setting and the story. All in all I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more by the author.	2003-07-29

Normally I don't read devotionals, preferring to spend my time studying the Bible in-depth. But my sister purchased this for me, knowing I'm a huge LCH fan. I can't praise this book enough. Every morning I look forward to reading the day's devotional, and often I end up reading three or four before I can put the book down. It's a terrific way to start the day out right--praising God, drawing into His presence, and having a good chuckle while I'm at it. Kudos to you, Liz, for writing such a lovely book.	2003-02-14

I found myself instantly caught up in the story of Miryam and Marcus, and thoroughly enjoyed the weaving of gospel stories within the fabric of a well written novel.I'm a huge fan of their work, and to me each book is better than the last.

The Thoene's have a gift for putting their readers in the middle of their novels' fast paced action, and Jerusalem's Heart is no exception. Everything- from the characters to the dialogue to the non-stop suspense is carefully crafted and well executed. Whether read as part of the series or as a stand alone book,Heart is not to be missed.	2001-04-09

So often with novels that deal with religious, and specifically Christian themes, publishers and readers alike want to label it as a &quot;religious&quot; book or a &quot;secular&quot; book.  The point must be made that when you read this novel, you will be touched and changed whether you're a believer or not.  Caldwell raises important questions about God, Jesus, sin, and humanity, and challenges you to ponder these things in your own life. <br />Some of the reviewers expressed the concern that non-christians might be turned off by this book because of it's Christian content.  I have the reverse concern--I hope that Christians won't dismiss Caldwell's work because of the realistic, brutal, and graphic portrayal of the post-rapture world and his very flawed, but very human protaganist.  We're admonished to keep our thoughts and deeds pure, and there's not much purity to be found in this story at all. What can be found is a riveting plot, brilliantly executed by an excellent writer, who relates and explores his theme beautifully.  The novel is so complex and multilayered that it will speak to each individual reader in a different way.  Read it, and find out for yourself.	2001-02-07

Littauer's Personality Plus, the predecessor to this book was informative, but this one really dives into the personalities in depth as they relate to our tempermental make-up and family history.  She also adds a deeper spiritual element to her work, which challenges the reader even further.  I can't imagine a better tool for finding out why you are the way you are, who and what influenced your personality, and why we all should accept ourselves and each other the way God created us.	2000-10-28

Francine Rivers, in her usual flawless style, brings readers the story of a Canaanite prostitute who risked her life to hide two Israelite spies, and because of her bravery and deep belief in God was richly rewarded.  The second book in the Lineage series, Rahab reminds us never to lose faith, even in our darkest moments.	2000-10-23

The fast paced follow up to Jerusalem Vigil, Thunder from Jerusalem is an engaging, emotionally powerful book.

(Since it was written by a Popular Sanguine, I guess I shouldn't be surprised).  I had a tremendous amount of fun reading this, taking the tests, analyzing my friends and family, and seeing how the Lord has made us perfect in His sight.  The most invaluable information I gleaned from the text was why my son and I clash so often- we're both melancholies, and I see aspects of my personality that I struggle with in him.  I now have the tools to work on my weaknesses, and my relationships with others.  Thank you, Ms. Littauer, for such an insightful book!	2000-10-16

I must agree with the author's comments on her own book- Bestseller is the best how-to book on novel writing, and I've read lots of them.  Her advice is practical, useful, and well explained; she's one of the few authors who actually illustrates how to create a mind map-giving you an example from one of her published novels- instead of simply suggesting that it's something to think about doing. Brayfield writes with intelligence and empathy for beginning, struggling, and even successful writers.  A must read for anyone contemplating writing a novel, and for those of us who are wrestling with the process.	2000-10-10

When my husband saw me reading &quot;Bad Girls of the Bible,&quot; he  asked me why I wasn't reading about the good girls.  The answer is simple;  occasionally you learn more from the mistakes of some  than from the  perfection of others. Curtis-Higgs has written an excellent book.   Combining fiction, research, and thought provoking questions, she's  provided readers from all kinds of backgrounds, both christian and  non-christian, points to ponder.

What I love about her is that you know exactly  where she's coming from, her faith and love for the Lord saturates each  book she writes, and this one is no exception.  Perhaps the best part about  this novel is the fantasy of it; a handsome, contemporary prince in an  imaginary land marries, and falls in love with a normal citizen.  Isn't  that why we read fiction- to be taken away from everyday life for a few  hours?  I highly recommend this book and any other of Wick's, for her sweet  stories and uncompromising commitment to Christ.	2000-08-30

If you're  looking for romance, spirituality, adventure, and suspense, this is the  novel for you.  With well-crafted characters that stay with you long after  reading the final word on the last page, and an uplifting testimony to  God's grace, mercy, and love, Ms. Noble has written a moving and gripping  story, one that I will read again and again.	2000-08-28

I fell more deeply in love with the characters; I laughed  with them, cried with them, rejoiced with them.  History, romance,  intrigue, tragedy, humor and hope are all skillfully woven together to  create a beautiful novel.  If you're already a Thoene fan, you won't be  disappointed.

The  character of Hadassah is skillfully written; a woman who lives her life as  Christ would have us do, yet struggles with her own fears and doubts.  A  story that challenges the reader to examine his/her own life.  I'd give it  ten stars if I could.	2000-05-17

Putting a face on the victims of one man and his minions' insatiable quest for power  and revenge made the experience real for me- the atrocities that happened  long ago have been softened by time, completely forgotten, or worse,  distorted and misrepresented.  The Zion books are a reminder of what  occurred over fifty years ago and a tribute to the strength and faith that  the Jewish people possess.	2000-05-12

I can appreciate the author's intention of comparing the  characters' lives before they accepted Christ, and after they were saved.   But I disliked the sisters so much during the first half of the book that I  had a hard time caring about their lives in the second half.  I also agree  with some of the comments posted earlier- this book could have been cut way  down, and the message would have been the same.

I'm even recommending them to my dad, who strictly reads  non-fiction, because I think he would enjoy them immensely.
