The book first introduces the student to life at an American university and teaches how to begin a conversation and ask for information on campus.  The next section of the book deals with making appointments with the instructor.  Some of my students were only taking one term of English classes so I related the appointments section to making an appointment in an English-speaking work environment.  Another section of the book focuses on leading group discussions.  There are several chapter that discuss presentations.  The book has plenty of creative, interactive activities in each chapter and supplies the students with a variety of practical, new expressions throughout.  I recommend it!	2005-09-19

It's illustrations, although simple, are sufficient to show children the basic form of letters.  The story is written more like a song and the words will stay with you and your little ones for the rest of the day!  All the letters go up the tree and...uh oh!!!...They all fall down!  My only criticism is that the letters are all lower case letters and my boys began learning their capital letters first.  This means that my boys don't make the connections between some of the letters in the book and the ones they know.  Regardless, it's a silly little story and rhyme that you just can't get out of your head.  Chika chika boom BOOM!	2005-04-11

They are engrossed by the tune and odd pictures but don't understand why the old lady swallows so many things. Does anyone? Of course, this book follows the tune of the childhood song we all grew up with but she swallows a fly, a spider, a bird, a cat, a dog, a goat, a cow, and a horse.  I don't remember her swallowing such large animals! I think my kids are a bit disturbed by the fact that she swallows things they consider pets and nice animals-cats, dogs, horses.  When we sing it, I change the line, \\"perhaps she'll die\\" to \\"perhaps she'll cry\\".  In a way, I wish I would have waited to get this book for them because I don't think they were ready for it but now they ask for it all the time.	2005-03-10

The course title is \\"College Listening Skills\\".  I love this book.  It focuses on preparing the student to enter into a university and be prepared to hear and understand college lectures.  The book concentrates on good note-taking skills and teaches a variety of skills, tips, and pointers on how to enhanse note-taking skills.  There is an optional CD available to listen to the lectures.  I think the book would be useless wihtout access to the CD or listening materials.	2005-03-10

They could use some encouragement to help them put away their toys and clean up after themselves though.  I think this book has both things.  It shows a variety of dinosaurs being good role models and straightening up thier rooms, putting toys away, and putting dirty clothes in the hamper, etc.. It's appropriate for children ages 3-5.  The illustrations are nice and realistic, except the \\"kids\\" are dinosaurs living in people houses.  It's cute and it's a board book.	2005-03-10

When we go to a play group, my kids are always so active and exploratory compared to other kids.  Helpful moms would try to goive me advice which never worked.  Unitl I read this book, I thought it was me and that I was doing something wrong.  This great book made me understand that this is the temperment of my children and there is nothing I can do to change it.  It does give helpful advice on how to best deal with spirited children as well as a quiz to determine if your child does indeed fall into the spirited category.  I recommend it to all those parents of spirtied kids!	2004-01-13

The book has many photos of simplified signs that are easy to learn.  However, it has alot more writing than signs.  I would prefer more sings and pictures and less writing. We've used several signs for things that we do every day such as eat and bath but our boys still don't seem to catch on.  Perhaps it will mean more with they are a bit older (they are 16 month old twins) but by that time they should be able to say some words anyway.  So, the book is a good idea, but I'd buy it used or borrow it from the library instead of buying it yourself.  You also have to be really dedicated to use the signs because kids need constant repetition in order to remember something.  It is just not natural to sign things repeatedly!  It is something you have to constantly be thinking about.  Perhaps others have better results than we did.	2003-08-21

I haven't yet pulle dout the book because I wanted to find out how someone else did something.  A cute idea if you have a good memory and are really organized.

I am very happy with it.  All of the hikes/walks are pretty short.  Long enough to get out and get some exercise but not too long.  The book lists hikes throughout the entire island-I think there is good variety. Some of them are just simple beach walks that you may not have thought of on your own.  There are a few serious hikes but if you are a serious hiker I'd get a different book.  It has great directions and explanations for the hikes.  This would be a great book if you are planning on traveling to Oahu and don't want to hang out on the beach all day, every day.  The two very small negatives are it doesn't have the difficulty rating for each hike, but I imagine they are almost all beginning to intermediate. The other is it lists a hike that has been closed by the government for over a year now and it doesn't look like it will open any time soon.  I would prefer the author replace that with another hike.  Enjoy!	2003-02-05

This book has taken us thorugh tropical rain forests, dense valleys, and sun-parched craters.  The variety of hikes is wonderful.  There is something for everyone in here, well, everyone except the beginner hiker.  It seems even beginning hikes in the book are a bit challenging.  This is because Oahu has such a varity of terrain.  However, if you are looking to take a relaxing stroll through the woods this book will be of no use to you.  We have children so we only do the novice hikes and even those are challenging, but fun and dirty!  This is probalby for more serious hikers and some of the hikes mentioned are 12 miles long!  That takes a long time in Oahu's terrain!  The author always write in interesting tidbits of info in his hike description which I like.  Things such as the where the strawberry guava trees are, where the WWII tunnel is, etc...The one negative to this book is that many of the hikes the author writes about are closed to the public and you have to write for permission to hike them.  To me, this is a pain and I am not organized enough to plan ahead and do this.  If you are better organized than I, I am sure you would enjoy them.  We are just a bit more spontaneous.

You know, one of those babies who can't sleep through the night at eight months?  Or a nap-time boycotter?  Does your child need to be rocked or fed to fall asleep?  <br />I really recommend this book for parents of difficult sleepers.  It includes sections on sleep habits of newborns all the way up to teens.  The following are some of the helpful things I learned from it:<br />1.  Your children will wake up around the same time each morning regardless of the time they go to bed<BR>2.  Put your children to bed when they are sleepy-it doesn't help to keep them up longer to play more or so they will sleep in<BR>3.  Motion sleep such as in a swing, car or stroller is not quality sleep<BR>4.  A nap does not count as a nap if it is less than 45 minutes<br />I have learned from experience that changing children's sleep patterns can be difficult but worth the rewards in the long run.  Naptime is still rough for my twins, but nighttime is great.  Sam and Theo sleep 11 hours a night.  That means my husband and I get to sleep seven to eight hours!  Wow!	2002-11-19

If you want to belive that all pregnancies are fun and easy and turn out well, I wouldn't read this book.  But this book is very realistic and incredibly informative.  It covers everything you should and shouldn't do and what you should expect, hence the title.  My only complaint is that the authors are a bit extreme on some topics such as nutrition.  It is by far the best general pregnancy book out there.	2002-10-14

The thing I liked best about this book is that it told you what was happening inside of you each week. It told you the approximate size of your baby, how much it probably weighed, what was developing, how it looked etc...I found that so interesting!	2002-10-14

I don't think the format (divided into months just like the \\"expecting\\" one) works well. For each supposed month of your baby's age there is a corresponding section which tells what your baby should and should not be doing.  Babies grow and develop at different rates. My babies' issues and questions never came up in the month the book had them listed. It was also a bit difficult to reference. For example, instead of putting a section on eating in each month, I would prefer to see it all in one chapter starting with bottle/breast feeding and progressing to baby food, etc...And just like \\"expecting\\", the authors have definate ideas about how you should do some things and it sometimes comes off as extreme. There is a wide variety of baby/parenting info in the book and I do, however, think all the information presented was accurate and informative. I think it is just the format that does not work well for me.	2002-10-14

The book offers many creative alternatives to television for those of us who aren't so creative ourselves.  Her ideas are simple and easy to do, which is what I most appreciate about it.  I have twins so I don't have alot of free time to create fancy playthings and crafts.  The author reminds us that children find great delight in the simple things in life, like pretend cooking in the kitchen and helping Mom clean the house.  Although not complex, I never would have thought of half this stuff myself!  A great buy for new parents as well as a gift for expecting ones.	2002-10-14

Although practiced by the majority of Haitians, it is not an open, in-your-face religion. The book has a good, detailed, historical background of both Haiti and Voodoo.  The discussions about Voodoo are detailed, professional, informative, scholarly, and very non-biased. The history is quite in depth so don't buy this book if you are looking for a light hearted explanation of teh subject.  This book helped me to understand Voodoo's cultural significance in Haiti and to understand why it is believed to be a \\"religion\\".  The book's photos are excellent. I bought the French version of this book so I can't comment on the English translation.	2002-09-12

I found this to be a good general book for some basic knowledge.  It is what it says, an &quot;introduction&quot;.  My goal was to learn a few key frases and the book succeeded in that regard.  I would not consider it a scholarly piece of work, however.  It is also nice that the tape comes along with it.  Even knowing a few words can really set you apart.	2002-09-12

It is a wonderful piece of work.  My perspective is as someone who spent 9 months working in Haiti, however, I am not sure how appreciated it would be by someone who is less familiar with the country.  It terrificly explains the tragic history of Haiti and ties in somewhat current events.  I enjoyed reading it with the familiarity of knowing the places the author descibes.  The only negative to this book may be that recent history isn't included due to it's publication date. As those familiar with Haiti well know, the political situation can quickly change in such a fragile country.	2002-08-24

Kennedy Jr. (2nd Edition)	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Nostalgic gift idea for parents	We've given this book as a gift to both of our parents.  Once they finally opened it and listened to the CD they remarked how much it brought back memories of growing up.  It also is interesting for those of us who have grown up after most of these events happened because it gives us a sense of severity and reality which is often not relayed through history.  A great gift idea but also nice to have in your own library both for reference and for history's sake.	2002-08-17

I bought this book to learn more about the Andean textiles I began collecting while working in Peru and Bolivia.  The photos are beautiful and the info is pretty good-good for a beginner but probably not as helpful for a collector with more expertise.  There are not many books on this subject and I'm interested to know if anyone has found a better one.	2002-08-06
