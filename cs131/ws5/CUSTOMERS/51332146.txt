The plot within a plot wove its way between the characters with a lot of foreshadowing and unexpected twists. <br /> <br />Maris Matherly-Reed is a New York book editor who decides to examine her \\"slush\\" pile of manuscripts received without agent representation. She comes across the prologue for the novel \\"Envy\\" which she finds captivating. Her father Daniel owns the publishing house while her husband of nearly two years, Noah Reed, is his right hand man. Maris seeks out the author of the prologue on the island of St. Anne off the coast of Georgia. Although the reclusive author does not appear happy to see her, Maris is determined to spend quality time with him and learn the rest of the story. <br /> <br />The prologue was a great device to set the scene. Characters from the prologue find their way into Maris' real life drama. Her pursuit of its author is what sparks Maris into questioning the state of her marriage and the lack of happiness and fulfillment that she currently faces. But is Maris being manipulated? Is she a plot device within the novel? These are all questions that the reader asks throughout the plot's twists and turns. This is riveting storytelling.    <br />	2005-06-14

But instead of being steamy, it was more like lots of carnal sex scenes strung together that almost seemed repetitive. The other thing that continued ad nauseum was the main character Grace Jenkins' low self body image. <br /> <br />Noah Harper is the rich guy from the wrong side of the tracks. He is the grandson of Grace's employer who took him in when he was a late teenager when she discovered her son had fathered him. He is street smart, a savvy businessman and a sexual animal. <br /> <br />As an aside, I am totally for the heroine to have flaws like a real person and not be the stick thin chic runway model type. But then why does the guy inveritably have a perfect body in these situations? Doesn't the stereotype work both ways? Or do these authors think that the readers will identify with the woman's flaws but not accept them from the male characters, since these books are supposed to be an escape? I just needed to ask this question.   <br /> <br />I would have liked to have seen some wooing of Grace on Noah's behalf. His deal with Grace to be his sex slave and do whatever he asked for in the bedroom was fine as long as Grace was also having a good time. But while Noah was fiercely possessive of Grace, he didn't spend a lot of time romancing her.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

I was very impressed with the way the plot was staged detailing the twin sisters' lifetime relationship against the chance meeting of Maddie and David. <br /> <br />Maddie was the determined twin, taking her feelings of responsibility for her sister to great heights after living through her sister's three month coma at age nine following her fall through the ice at their Texas family home. Her mother had always told her she had to take care of Cassie. She has blamed herself for her sister's accident and insisted on living her life on the lookout for her sister's welfare and safety ever since. <br /> <br />David Marshall is an FBI agent on a 10 year hunt for an art thief that has continued to elude authorities. His personal vendetta against Peyton Shriver is what drives him, to the detriment of any personal relationships with women. His meeting with Maddie while jogging in a park waiting for her identical twin sister Cassie, an FBI informant, is intense and full of sparks. The sexual tension during this very physical meeting is just the beginning! <br /> <br />This book was engaging from beginning to end. I am looking forward to Cassie's story in Mission: Irresistible!	2005-06-07

Both of the main characters had intense rooting value.  <br /> <br />Gracie Landon had been in exile since she was fourteen. She had found herself the star of the local newspaper's \\"Gracie Chronicles\\" after stalking her first crush, Riley Whitefield. The whole town of Los Lobos was aware of Gracie and her unrequited love. Her mother felt disgraced by her so-called friends and sent Gracie to live with her aunt and uncle. Gracie has come home after fourteen years to help with her sister Vivian's wedding plans. Gracie is a reknowned cake maker and has agreed to make her sister's wedding cake. In the process, she is trying to reconnect with both sisters, Vivian and Alexis, and her mother. All have family issues with which they are trying to come to terms. <br /> <br />Gracie finds that she is still deeply attracted to Riley, who is back in town after traveling the South China Sea developing oil rigs. Riley is pursuing his own personal vendetta in the process of running for mayor of Los Lobos. But along the way, he finds himself captivated by Gracie, who always leads with her heart.    <br /> <br />This was a great romance from beginning to end!	2005-06-04

This was much more suspense than romance, but both aspects were very satisfying.    <br /> <br />Jenna Hughes is trying to put her past life in Hollywood behind her as she struggles to raise her two daughters in a rambling rural estate near a small Oregon town. Sheriff Shane Carter is a workaholic who has not made time for women in his life since his wife died several years ago. Both are attracted to each other, but each have many issues to deal with in their personal lives. Over time, Jenna comes to depend on Carter as her life spins out of control with each note, phone call and other calling cards left for her by a stalker. This stalker is a real sicko! With all the colorful characters in the book and red herrings thrown in along the way, the stalker could be just about anyone. This makes Jenna constantly jumpy, questioning her own judgment at every turn. Her teenaged daughter's rebellious behavior just raises the stakes as Jenna works to try to keep her family safe. This is a book you will not put down.	2005-06-01

The author appeared to force the chemistry between Dr. Houston Hayes, orthopedic surgeon, and resident Josie Adkins. It was hard to believe that Houston really had feelings for Josie. Josie was portrayed as being completely unhappy with her self image, her weight, and her struggle to come to terms with the fact that she doesn't really want to be a surgeon. This clearly shows in her approach to surgery. On the flip side, Houston is self-assured, arrogant in his capabilities as a surgeon and aloof. When he initiates an encounter with Josie in a hospital supply closet, it felt out of place and awkward where it could have been spontaneous combustion. <br /> <br />When Houston is attacked by a shark while surfing, losing mobility in his right thumb and forefinger, Josie becomes more important to him as he puts the rest of his life in perspective. But as a reader, I really didn't see what he saw in her and did not feel a real, cosmic match. The ending went out with a whimper. This was not a passionate romance.	2005-05-24
US	51332146	RYWNCLMZF5J89	0451215060	675455607	Just Peachy	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Good Relationship Story	This was a loose follow up to Jill Winters' first novel, Plum Girl, which focused on Lonnie Kelley. This one takes place 2 1/2 years later, focusing on Lonnie's younger sister Peach. It was good, but it didn't have the romantic fireworks of Plum Girl, Raspberry Crush or Blushing Pink.  <br /> <br />We see a romantic build up from the beginning as Peach and Adam become close friends in the office, but not even so much as a kiss until about 2/3 of the way through the book. This one was very similar to Plum Girl in that Peach Kelley falls for a guy who is very much like Dominick, Lonnie's husband. It also had a similar background plot with something sinister going on within Millenium Gift Basket Company. Lonnie's story had a murder mystery within the law firm where she was acting as a contract temp. <br /> <br />Adam is lonely, trying to play referee with his parents who are living separately and contemplating a divorce. He is considering ending a five year relationship with a woman who recently took a lateral job position with her company and moved to Prague. Prior to this he had a six year relationship that ran through college. He feels he needs his space to have his freedom, but at the same time, he finds Peach irresistible. Although they are opposites in many ways, they both have big hearts. <br /> <br />I guess I would have rated this book higher if I had not read her prior novels first. It was a worthy effort, but not her best work. Overall, I enjoy the witty banter of Jill Winters' books and the real life angst moments where the characters come to terms with their quirks and learn to live with them.	2005-05-17

The image of a naked Boston Macnamara in the haunted bedroom of the bed and breakfast with his manhood caught in the antique white eyelet bedspread as Shelby Tucker was conducting the haunted house tour was an image to behold. With this kind of introduction, I felt like the book was going to have a lot of zippy dialogue and sexual tension. <br /> <br />But by mid-book, the story was losing steam fast. The relationship between Shelby and Boston would have been stronger if Shelby would have continued to be the quick witted, charming country bumpkin who was comfortable in her own skin. But she started to wallow in self-pity, acting like she was not the right match for Boston and insisting that she could never leave Cuttersville Ohio. I started to feel like Shelby was right and she would have been better off in a re-marriage to her ex-husband, farmer Danny Tucker. Heck, he was even starting to look too good for her! The ghosts that may or may not have been haunting or cohabitating in the houses of Jessie Stritmeyer, Shelby's grandmother, never had a resolution within the story. This would not have been 100% necessary, but it would have added some depth since they were part of the background to the story. I felt overall the book started out promising but had some missed opportunities as it came to an uneven conclusion.	2005-05-10

Another winner for Lucy Monroe.  <br /> <br />Alex and Isabel meet for the first time when Alex confronts Isabel at her office, demanding to know why she is trying to raid his top employee. Isabel says she was just doing her job as a career specialist to assist her client who asked for this particular employee. Later Alex calls her to ask her to dinner, with the ulterior motive to find the name of her client. He suspects it is her father, John Harrison, who he blames for his father's death from a heart attack two years ago. As such, he feels justified in his motive to exact revenge on John Harrison by taking down his company, Hypertron. In the course of his background check of John Harrison, he has had a photo of Isabel for the past two years which he has been infatuated with ever since. The real woman seals the deal in his mind~ he has to make her his. He feels if he marries her, she won't leave him when she finds out about his separate revenge motive, as she is somewhat estranged from her father anyway. When he finds her list of requirements for the father of the babies she intends to have on her desk, he uses it to bait her, in the hopes of convincing her to marry him if only to have the babies she desires.   <br /> <br />The chemistry between Isabel and Alex is smoldering. Alex has not made time for women in the past in his quest to develop his company, CIS. He is captivated by Isabel, while still trying to stay on course with his revenge motive that he feels is justified. He does not want to lose Isabel in the process as he desperately needs her in his life. Isabel is drawn to Alex in spite of her eventual discovery of his revenge motive. The only thing missing is the knowledge that he loves her. <br /> <br />This is a real \\"can't miss\\" romance. <br /> <br />	2005-05-07

I much preferred The Thrill of It All and Do Not Disturb. I found the push pull tension between sisters Zoe & Lyssa and their intended men, Deke & Yeager to be tedious. I had to force myself to continue reading to the end. I also did not feel either couple had much chemistry together. <br /> <br />Zoe and Lyssa run Haven House on Abrigo, an island town off the coast of California. Both have survived the untimely death of their parents and Lyssa's leukemia soon afterwards. Lyssa is a five year leukemia survivor and ready to live her own life. Zoe takes comfort in the safe haven of the island and refuses to leave it for any reason. Since the tragedies that befell them in the past always took place away from the island, Zoe feels that Abrigo is the only place where they will both be safe and together. <br /> <br />Deke returns to the island to assist his friend and colleague, Yeager Gates' recovery from a motorcycle accident that has effectively ended his career as an astronaut and currently left him blind. Deke is also there to refurbish his late uncle's house that he had visited in his childhood and last visited with his then-wife, who deserted him there during their honeymoon. <br /> <br />Lyssa is attracted to Deke at first sight, insisting they are soul mates. Deke insists that at age 43 he is much too old for her. He is also guarding his heart which has been broken since the break up of his long ago marriage. Zoe is attracted to Yeager but she feels he would never be with her if he was not blind and saw that she is not like the glamorous women he was frequently photographed with in magazines as a celebrity. I also had a hard time buying their union. <br /> <br />I guess I was spoiled reading her later novels first.	2005-05-05

But her personal trainer and love at first sight, Theo Redmond steals the show. He is too good to be true~ gorgeous golden boy, rock solid body, emotionally in touch with those around him and overall sexy as hell. At first Lucy thinks he just has to be a shallow pretty boy with his biggest crises potentially weighted in hair gel. Little does she know that after his parents died in a freak boating accident three years ago that he assumed primary responsibity for his now sixteen year old brother Brian \\"Buddy\\" who has Down's Syndrome and in the process dropped out of medical school in his M-3 year.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book, which was as typically heartwarming as all of Susan Donovan's books are. It is not as steamy as my personal favorite book of hers, Knock Me Off My Feet, but it is a nice read.  <br /> <br />I wonder if Lucy's brother Dan, a pediatrics resident in Pittsburgh will be the subject of a future novel, after his blossoming romance with Cuban supermodel Gia Altamonte fizzles in this one. Maybe Gia will have a change of heart. Or possibly Dan will meet someone that is an even better match for his Irish good looks...	2005-04-27

This is my first Erin McCarthy book. I was very impressed with her witty dialogue, steamy encounters and the emotional weight between the characters.  <br /> <br />Both Reese and Knight come with some baggage. Reese was raised without a mother (who died when she was very young) by her father and four older brothers. She is looking to take control of her previously male dominated life and to be taken seriously in her journalistic pursuits. She portrays herself as not looking for a commitment. Knight is ten years older (age 36), divorced, does not get along well with his boss and is leading a lonely life while trying to hold his career together. Reese brings laughter (and great sex) to his life, but at the same time poses a challenge and threat to his current FBI investigation of price fixing among pharmaceutical companies. Their romance is heartfelt and passionate in between their sassy repartee!	2005-04-24

I was captivated by the love story between Amanda Zachary, a self described career woman who does not think she is capable of being attractive to men, and Simon Brant, the genius, recluse inventor responsible for the technology that drives his family computer company. When Amanda pursues a merger between Extant, her employer and their main competitor, Brant Computers, she finds herself at odds with Simon, who has no intention of taking the company public and losing even one employee in the process. His cousin Eric is in favor of the merger, mostly because of Amanda's sound proposal and his trust in the integrity that he feels she brings to the table. Simon is intrigued with Amanda from the start, although it is she personally that he wants to learn more about, not the merger.  <br /> <br />The attraction between Amanda and Simon is explosive. Both feel that they don't quite \\"fit\\", Amanda due to her failed prior marriage and Simon due to his need to be in the lab working on experiments that drive him and the fact that he has no real emotional connection to anyone other than his butler/caretaker Jacob and his cousin Eric. But together, Amanda and Simon appear to fit extremely well.	2005-04-19

Angel Buchanan was searching for the truth about her natural father, Stephen Whitney upon his recent death. He was a world reknown \\"Artist of the Heart\\" with a reputation for paintings resembling a cross between Norman Rockwell and Andy Warhol who left her when she was 4 years old. She crashes his funeral under the guise of wanting to write a story on Whitney for a west coast magazine. She meets Cooper Jones, brother to Stephen Whitney's widow at the funeral. She learns that her accommodations have been set up at Tranquility House, his family's retreat which is a conclave of cottages with no speaking, electronic devices, meat or caffeine allowed and tofu reigns supreme at every meal, much to her chagrin.    <br /> <br />Angel's burgeoning relationship with Cooper is against both of their rules. Cooper has survived two heart attacks from heredity and a previously stressful life as a high powered criminal defense attorney. Angel does not trust men due to her abandonment issues from her father. Cooper wants to protect his family at all costs. He agrees to Angel doing a story on Whitney, although he is not completely trusting of the outcome in terms of his family's welfare. The sideline relationships with Whitney's previous relationships to the other family members make for interesting diversions to the main characters' romance.	2005-04-17

I felt it took a little long to get started, but once the Annabelle plot was finally in place, it provided a great romance and a springboard to her two future books surrounding Sophie and Micki.  <br /> <br />Annabelle, Sophie and Micki Jordan are three adult sisters orphaned in childhood when their parents died in a plane crash. It was up to their uncle, Yank Morgan, to take them in or they would be placed individually in foster care. Although Uncle Yank came through, Annabelle still has serious abandonment and control issues, as she dreams each night of having her sisters taken away from her and being alone. All three sisters work at The Hot Zone, Uncle Yank's public relations firm in Manhattan, run side by side with Lola, Uncle Yank's right hand woman who served as a mother figure for the girls. Yank and Lola had a relationship prior to the girls' arrival. But Yank said Lola was too good for him, and did not resume the relationship, instead having a myriad of affairs, much to Lola's chagrin. <br /> <br />Yank assigns Annabelle to Brandon Vaughn, a former Heisman Trophy winner and Super Bowl champion. Vaughn needs a publicist to assist him in overcoming problems he is having setting up a lodge in his hometown of Greenlawn, NY to serve as both a summer camp for kids with learning disabilities and a winter vacation spot. Someone is sabotaging his progress as he works to open the lodge on schedule. <br /> <br />Annabelle is a refreshing, take charge woman in spite of her deep rooted emotional insecurities. She decides to go after what she wants with Vaughn, fully expecting that he will not reciprocate her feelings. She decides she will force herself to move on after her work in Greenlawn is complete. Vaughn realizes that they are kindred spirits, but feels Annabelle deserves more than he can give her at this time. The two characters have great chemistry.	2005-04-09

The storyline starts with Felicity Charm at a crossroads in her life, winning the \\"Joanie\\" for best on-air host of her GetTV shopping channel show. She is determined to turn her back on the Charm relatives who raised her from an orphan at age 4 once and for all after having made it in the glitzy world of television sales. While driving her new prize Thunderbird she gets a call from Aunt Vi asking for her help in finding her wayward cousin Ben. Insisting to herself that this is the last time she will involve herself in these family problems, she turns around and ends up losing control of her car (on a road seeded on purpose with nails by her Uncle Billy to enhance his auto repair business) and crashing into another vehicle. Alone in the desert in the pouring rain, cold, hungry and surrounded by tarantulas outside the jeep, Felicity (or Lissie as Michael calls her) takes to Michael, the stranger who seems to have brought her back to life in more ways than one. <br /> <br />After leaving Michael and their almost sexual encounter behind when the tow truck arrives, she is shocked to find that she and Michael Magee have more of a connection through the Charm family. As Felicity struggles to try to turn her back on the backward world of Half Palm California, she finds it difficult to resist the allure of Magee, a former rock climber with more talents than she realized. It is the journey of Felicity putting behind her pre-conceived ideas about people and letting herself lead with her heart that takes the story full circle.	2005-04-02

She had planned on marrying David until she caught him cheating on her with a stripper on her newly refinished dining room table. She built a wall around herself to keep from being hurt, trying to convince her well meaning (and marriage obsessed) Italian family that she does not want to get married and does not need a man to be happy. She uses food to insulate herself from the hurt. She meets Dante Del Rosso, a hot Italian restaurant owner outside his restaurant after fleeing her first meeting of the \\"Chubby Chums\\", a dieters support group at the church across the street.  <br /> <br />Dante is attracted to Maria just as she is, which Maria is unable to understand. She pushes him away at every turn. At times I found myself rooting for Dante as he really seemed too good for Maria and her harsh militant stance against anything more than \\"sex with no strings\\" encounters with men. Dante is unwilling to have this type of fling with Maria and insists that he wants her to fall in love with him before giving in to their mutual sexual attraction. After she betrays Dante at his own restaurant by inviting a former flame from high school to a bachelorette party at his restaurant, Maria must come to terms with the hurt she's caused and decide how to take charge of her life and find the happiness that has eluded her.      <br /> <br />Like in The Bride Wore Chocolate, there are recipes at the start of each chapter.

Neither she nor Joe could forget this meeting. Charlotte left the scene to pick up her intended husband Kurt at the airport after which he proposed and she accepted. Then 13 years later Joe, now a DEA agent undercover as he awaits his testimony in a drug lord's trial, moves into a house next door to her in Minton, Ohio. Neither she nor Joe knew each other's name and are shocked to see each other again.   <br /> <br />Charlotte is now a widow with two children. She is lonely and thinks about Joe every day. Joe fears he needs to get out of Charlotte's life so that he and her family will not be brought into the danger with the million dollar price on his head. But he finds it difficult to stay away from her life and decides to remain in Minton. <br /> <br />This was a nice romance but not what I would call steamy as most of that drama took place 13 years ago and is just recalled many times. It was more of a family drama which was still enjoyable.	2005-03-12

Audie comes from a family where she did not feel love, thus she acts flaky and refuses to let herself commit fully to any relationship. But that was before she met Quinn, a police detective that is fully deserving of her love if she can ever let herself go. He even offers to let her \\"rent\\" his family if she finds she can't live without them but won't commit to him. <br /> <br />I thought Quinn was an excellent macho, fiercely loyal and giving character that was more than a match for Audie. Turnabout is fair play in the end where Audie must find it within herself to determine if she deserves what Quinn has offered. <br /> <br />	2005-02-27

The characters of Nick and Delaney have a history going back to childhood that is impossible for construction company owner Nick Allegrezza to forget. Nick has been with lots of women, but none of them have affected him since he was a boy like Delaney. He keeps the other women constantly throwing themselves at him at bay so that there is no reason for them to think that he will ever marry any of them. Although they keep trying! <br /> <br />Hairstylist Delaney Shaw is not the most gorgeous woman in town, but there is something about her that makes Nick want her, even while he tries to stay away from her when she returns to town after a ten year absence to attend her step-father's funeral. A step-father who also happens to be Nick's natural father, although Henry Shaw refused to acknowledge Nick while he was alive. After the reading of the conditions of Henry's will and the chance to inherit 3 million dollars after one year in Truly, Idaho, Delaney rethinks her immediate plans to leave and sets up shop on Main Street, which is next to Nick's construction company office. The ensuing drama builds as the two try as they might can't seem to keep their hands off each other. <br /> <br />Very heartwarming and fun!	2005-02-20

Her previous novel's Randall Johnson was from Texas who also overcame extreme adversity to become a force to be reckoned with in the world of big business.  <br /> <br />Jack Lanett is a meteorite hunter who overcame his juvenile record to become world renowned for his prowess at locating these finds coveted by both the academic research community and private colletors. Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Berglund is a journalist looking to interview Jack for the New York Times. After their first encounter which involves rescuing an injured dog outside Jack's building, Jack agrees to a future interview.  <br /> <br />In addition to Charlie's penchant for rescuing injured and stray animals and fostering them until suitable homes can be found, she is in the process of adopting a baby girl from China. Her previous marriage ended after several miscarriages and her ultimate inability to bear children of her own. After another failed attempt at a relationship, Charlie is trying to be strong and independent to create the family environment that she never had as a single parent. <br /> <br />When the case social worker voices reservations about Charlie's career as an adverture writer with routine travel to dangerous locales, Charlie approaches Jack to write a book on his big meteorite discovery to stay closer to home and proof that she can provide a safe income and home environment for a child. When Jack refuses and counter offers to marry her in a marriage of convenience to appease the social worker, Charlie reluctantly agrees.         <br /> <br />Along the way, as Jack shares his annual pilgrimage to watch the meteorite showers in the forest near the Poconos, both Charlie and Jack start to build a bond which grows deeper than the strictly business tie they had agreed on. <br /> <br />As an aside, it was like visiting cherished friends to see a brief reappearance of Randall and Kate Johnson (from A Bridge to Love) at the media event for the viewing of Jack's Sahara-Mars meteorite at the Museum of Natural History. It would make sense that Jack and Randall would travel in the same circles. <br /> <br />I can't wait for Nancy's next book! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-19

Hope Spencer comes to Gospel Idaho to get a new lease on her writing career and escape one of the subjects of a previous article series. She meets Sheriff Dylan Taber, the only hot eligible bachelor in town. He is not looking for a relationship as he is caring for his 7 year old son as a single father and wants to set a good example. Hope finds herself caught up in the colorful characters of the town and is able to extrapolate on their real life experiences and create alien fictional stories for \\"The Weekly News of the Universe\\" tabloid. She also finds herself getting back into life, healing from her previous divorce from a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles who left her for her best friend.   <br /> <br />Both Hope and Dylan have secrets from each other that threaten their future happiness. But over time they build on the depth of their love and find it difficult to be away from each other.	2005-02-16

The additional plot complications create stumbling blocks along the way, but do not develop into a real suspense storyline.  <br /> <br />If this were a Sandra Brown novel, the main character's much older, prescription drug addicted surgeon husband would have been mired in an underworld syndicate marking his wife Maci and his son Holt whom she truly loves for death. Instead, husband Seymour is just an arrogant drug addict who let a patient bleed to death on the operating table while he was high on drugs. His estranged son Holt, a high powered attorney currently living on his sail boat, is summoned to represent him when he is charged with murder. Holt just happens to be the man that Maci made passionate love to on the beach in Jamaica where she was on holiday with girlfriends two weeks prior to her marriage. Of course then they were known to each other only as \\"Stan\\" and \\"Mildred\\" and never saw each other again until now.    <br /> <br />Holt hates his father as he blames him for his mother's suicide several years ago. This sideline is never developed.  <br /> <br />There is great chemistry between Holt and Maci. Their romance was enough to keep me interested to the very end.	2005-02-13

The storyline was very involved with the main character Dory's rite of passage from age 14 to 31. Her one constant: her love for the chauffeur's son, Chase McKay, will break her heart. Chase went from being banished from the estate for having a rendezvous in the stable with 17 year old gorgeous sister Jill (albeit with paid college tuition to lessen the blow)to become a multimillionaire architect. Now he has the means to ease the pain and suffering inflicted on the family via an unscrupulous former employee, Dory's mother's poor judgment and her father's obsession with agreeing to her mother's wishes no matter what the cost to the family. But Dory doesn't want Chase's money; she wants his love. It's Chase that does not see things clearly, who Dory calls a \\"pompous, arrogant, condescending ass,\\" while he fights his attraction for her in lieu of her flashier high strung sister.        <br /> <br />The character development of the family matriarch Aunt Ping and the employees of Outlook Farm that they are all working to save is very fulfilling. What goes around comes around in the end.	2005-02-11

She starts out the story by wanting to take charge of her life again and flirt with someone in the airport terminal to show that she can do it. Then when her plan works and her mark, Mike Cameron falls head over heels for her at first sight, she retreats and finds every excuse as to why it could never work for them. But Mike has a plan of his own.     <br /> <br />After his mid-life catharsis following his 20 year high school reunion, he realizes that he had just never met the right woman. He is ready to adjust his priorities to have a family life and greater fulfillment.  <br /> <br />Normally the man in these novels is never looking for commitment in any way, shape or form and needs the woman to wear him down over time and then come to his own realization that he can't live without that woman.  Kate seemed too willing to turn her back on Mike too many times, even though he was a  charming character with his brightly colored ties, Hawaiian shirts and a real sense of who he was and what he wanted for himself.	2005-02-09

The plot had multiple layers bringing in the family secret tied to Beau's need for Celeste and Celeste's need to understand where she came from. Celeste's escape from her debutante upbringing, three failed engagements and sham of a father brings her to the \\"redneck\\" world of colorful characters within the NASCAR circuit. The reader is drawn into this world through Celeste, taking the journey of her self discovery while being drawn into the steamy romance ignited by the characters' powerful chemistry.    <br /> <br />In addition, if you haven't read French Twist or Tropical Getaway, I urge you to do so ASAP! Both are excellent romantic suspense.	2005-02-07

Nancy Warren knows how to stir up romance with colorful characters tying it all up with family secrets and mystery.  <br /> <br />Alex Forrest, a 30-year-old sexy librarian in the small town of Swiftcurrent Oregon thought she had to leave town to find a drop dead gorgeous, ruggedly handsome man like Duncan Forbes. She resists him at first as she does not trust him or her body's reactions to him. Duncan Forbes, an art professor on sabbatical to write a book on the Impressionists is taken by the hot blooded librarian, captivated by her short skirts, stiletto heels, sleek black hair and at the same time fierce adherence to the rules. Duncan's interest in her recently deceased grandfather and his connection to a lost Van Gogh make for clandestine investigations that he feels he needs to keep secret from Alex. <br /> <br />The side story of Alex's cousin Gillian, the co-heir to their grandfather's estate and a woman with a bad reputation in town adds a poignant addition to the story. Her attraction to the town's police seargeant going back to high school twelve years ago leads to a heartfelt romantic climax.	2005-02-06

The small town setting is comical, with lots of eccentric characters. Joe finds himself \\"trapped\\" at Emmylou's Bed & Breakfast in the midst of a business deal which the town wants no part of (his investors want to build a kitty litter plant there, which they condescendingly think will save the town from their bleak financial outlook.) <br /> <br />The solution appears to be right in front of them from the start, but it's the journey to this solution that is steamy, heart-warming and satisfying. I highly recommend this book for an escape.	2005-02-01

Kate and Randall will capture your heart and never let go. I was rooting for them both and even suggesting scenes to myself of how to get them together sooner- of course the book would have ended quicker which would have defeated the purpose! The presence of Kate's boys added to the story without being an obnoxious diversion as happens too often in other romances I've read. I can't wait for more Nancy Herkness novels!	2005-01-31

Maybe a spark of romance- since it was supposed to be a romance novel- would have lifted the mood. <br /> <br />I guess if it would not have been classified as a contemporary romance and strictly as fiction I would not have been so disappointed. There is almost no romance in this novel- and most of what little there is belongs to pubescent 15 year olds!    <br /> <br />The novel was depressing with only a glimmer of hope at the end for the two star-crossed would-be lovers who had never consummated their so called relationship, and still hadn't at the end of the book!  <br /> <br />On the bleak family front, I would have sent the 15 year old son to military school. Her 8 year old son was pathetic and seemed well on his way to obsessive compulsive, worry-wart oblivion.      <br /> <br />If you want romance with a zest for life, try Julie Ortolon's novels.	2005-01-28

Strong background on the promotion powerhouses that drive the elite level of the sport (likened to the studio system of Hollywood.) Lund provides a balanced framework in an essay format to let readers draw their own conclusions as to the future of the sport. Good quotes from skaters voicing opinions on both sides of the issues. An insightful retrospective on why skating went from double digit TV ratings in 1994 after the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal with umpteen made for TV pseudo competitions to the present state of a nearly non-existant professional figure skating circuit.	2003-01-16
