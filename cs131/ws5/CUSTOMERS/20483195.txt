You can have the same attitude as the wealthy.  Don't trouble yourself by reading history about the collapse of the Roman Empire, you don't need that type of guilt.  Remember, it's all about you!

We all know that the goal of a good journalist these days is to completely discredit people who are in the public eye.  The media loves to tear a person apart like a pack of hyenas surrounding a lion separated from his den.  Writing penetrating accounts with ambiguous details of politicians to destroy their public image is what sells books.  The Truth About Hillary is recommended for simple-minded people who enjoy the sarcastic wit of Ann Coulter and the ranting of Rush Limbaugh the reformed drug abuser.	2005-07-14

I'm certain that she regrets going to Hanoi in 1972 with her virulent hatred of American policy, so why doesn't she deserve to be forgiven for demoralizing the POWs?  She wasn't the only anti-war protestor during the Viet Nam War.  The descriptions of her eating disorders and her sexual insights into various relationships with men and women make her apology more than acceptable.  Personally, I think that this book is an entertaining story of an emotionally dysfunctional, yet fascinating woman.	2005-05-12

In a recent interview, he recommended buying his books instead of going to see his live act or listening to his CDs, because they are a better deal with more entertainment value per page.

Motherhood is a painfully overwhelming experience that insubstantial men never have to denounce.

However, not all of the report is boring, especially the facts describing how the attack was planned and executed.  The commision blames administrations, government agencies, and partisan groups for 9/11, but the blame should be placed on every adult in the United States.  We have never been prepared for a terrorist attack.  People felt that terrorism only happened in foreign countries, so why should we worry?  The 9/11 Commission Report is essential because it reminds Americans of our stupidity and what we can do to be proactive about our Homeland Security.	2004-10-15

He's been taking dope laced with poisons off the street for years and the cancer cells have been killed off.

What he didn't realize is how important he was to boys that religiously read every Hardy Boys book.  \\"The Secret Panel\\" is possibly Dixon's best story in the series. The Hardy Boys almost have a car accident with a mysterious man named John Meade and Joe finds a unique key with a weird symbol after he leaves.

His refutation of the War on Terror is mercifully short and overly persuasive, although one is tempted to quantify each fact presented as if it were random occurrence.  Eliminating international terrorism cannot be achieved by a bloated government ruled by partisan politicians who are more concerned about their own party than the actual safety of the American people. We have become the hunted lion in our own jungle.  Anonymous has a writing style that can be tedious to read at times, but he seems like a nice guy.  \\"Imperial Hubris\\" is filled with more references and useful information than I'll ever need, but that's what makes it so compelling to me.	2004-10-09

Collectors want alternate takes, live recordings, rare singles, vinyl record versions, and out-of-print albums by their favorite artists.  Bootlegs are prohibited by law in stores, and downloading or sharing music is illegal on the internet.  Record companies rarely release this material because they are more interested in exploiting new artists to make more money.  Collectors have no choice but to break outdated laws enforced by the RIAA, much like bootleggers did against prohibition.  All the record companies have to do is open an official website and let people download this material for a reasonable fee.  I am available as a consultant if they are interested.	2004-10-09

Although Jeff Beck has influenced countless guitarists for the last 40 years, the average person doesn't recognize his name.  He always preferred to restore his collection of antique cars, instead of recording new albums or touring.  In my opinion, he is probably the most versatile and innovative electric guitarist ever recorded.  Beck has played on sessions for artists including Tina Turner, Stanley Clark, Mick Jagger, Paul Rodgers, Jon Bon Jovi, Wynonna Judd, Chrissie Hynde, Donovan, and Stevie Wonder.  His solo albums have always broken new ground and his playing has never gotten stagnant. Beck's only weakness has been choosing inferior songs to fill out his albums.  Carson describes one incident when Beck seriously injured his thumb while working on one of his cars.  Instead of immediately going to a doctor, he fell asleep and was fortunate not have had any permanent damage done to his hand.	2004-09-17

Author Womack has done his homework, and he clearly is an Elvis fan.  His details are based on real events found in any Elvis biography and his insights on Presley's behavior are accurate.  Unfortunately, \\"Elvissey\\" is written in a style similar to \\"Clockwork Orange\\".  How can you go to the next chapter when you can't be sure you understood what you just read?
