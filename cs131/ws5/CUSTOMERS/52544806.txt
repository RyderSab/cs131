I found his approach generally dispassionate, fair, and objective -- although he did, from time to time, interject his personal opinion in a very subjective way. I was pleased with the list of source materials at the end of the book, but wished he had used footnotes or parenthetical references to show where he used these sources in his text. Considering that Dambach is writing about a disorder of uncertain origin and no known effective treatment, he has done a remarkable job gathering all the truths, half-truths, and fictions. I'm lucky. After 3 weeks with Bell's palsy, I am about 90% recovered. I've seen a family practice physician, a chiropractor, and a physical therapist. Dambach's best advice is &quot;Use your common sense because this disease will usually clear up in a relatively short period of time without any treatments&quot; -- a rather positive statement for a man who has never completely recovered from his two bouts with Bell's. For a non-life-threatening ailment, Bell's palsy is surprisingly frightening, discouraging, and depressing. Thank you, Mr. Dambach, for offering a sane, concise discussion.	2001-04-25

I think the Publishers Weekly review was right on target. Sinclair has spent 35 years in the toughest prison in the country. Just as anyone who has lived in a community for that many years, he has seen people, events, and history come and go. With a powerful commitment to not becoming an animal, he carved out a life of service and dedication, both to redeem himself for his crime and to create a meaningful existence where none seemed to exist for so many. Graphic, but not gratuitous, violence spills throughout most of the first half of the book. The characters are vivid and sometimes inspiring --- Swede who was on death row and gave him classics to read, and the man who died trying to save young prisoners from the inevitable rape that awaited them at Angola. This is a worthy read.	2001-01-02

He was repulsed by the New York art scene that had  so summarily dismissed black art when he had participated in a MOMA black  student art exhibit. Perhaps his avoidance of the centers of art commerce  were as responsible for the late acceptance of his genius as was the  segregationist mindset in the United States during Biggers's early career.  As well as producing important paintings, drawings, and sculpture, Biggers  is one of this country's most important muralists, creating more than  twenty major murals in fifty years.  His life has been dramatic in both  content and context. Wardlaw draws a clear portrait of African-American  life in the black section of a sharply segregated Gastonia, North Carolina,  where Biggers grew up in the 1930s, and the rich family and community life  of rural black America of the time. The other essays, written by noted  scholars, trace the history of Biggers's artistic career through a careful  study and analysis of his body of work.	1998-08-23

There are 270 works by 80 artists from  13 southern states. The full-page color plates are accompanied with Yelen's  text describing each work, often offering the artist's own words to  describe a piece. These artists, for the most part, are not concerned with  issues of preservation or conservation in their selection of materials.  Their relationship to their materials is organic. Several of the artists  paint in mud, a practice they continued even after interested patrons and  gallery owners supplied them with proper paints. Most self-taught artists,  says Yelen, begin their art late in life, usually after retirement. They  often create as a directive from God, His angels, or from visions in  dreams; they feel a spiritual connection to their work. The essays are well  written and informative, but the art itself speaks most eloquently.	1998-08-23

Stevens traces the  idea of the unconscious from its conception (which he believed to be around  1700) to the earliest investigations by Freud in the 1890s. The split  between Freud and Jung (essentially spirituality versus sexuality) is  described as having a profoundly shattering effect on Jung, as it had on  others ejected from the Freudian camp for their failure to endorse, without  question, Freud's theories that all neuroses is based in sexual  development. (Two of these ex-Freudians actually committed suicide after  being spurned by Freud.) Stevens's unique method of combining a primer of  Jung life-stage theory with a biography of Jung is an effective  introduction to the man and his work.	1998-08-23

From  emancipation until the 1940s, educated African Americans were in such small  numbers that they were all acquainted with one another. The sisters  remember meeting George Washington Carver, W.E.B. DuBois, Adam Clayton  Powell (Jr. and Sr.), Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, and a continuing list  of the famous and the educated among the nation's first four generations of  freed  slaves and their progeny. Good health has been Sadie's profession  and hobby since she graduated from college with a certificate to teach  domestic science. She eventually earned a Master's in education, and Bessie  became a dentist. The Delanys enjoyed everything that contributes to a good  life (except wealth, which has no doubt come about as a result of the  success of their book). The sisters and their eight siblings remained close  throughout their lives and followed their parents' example of public  service and living a dignified life. A rich spiritual life and living  honestly and well seem to have contributed to the longevity of these  remarkable women.	1998-08-23

A less well known facet of  Freudian principles, the role of psychic energy in the development of  personality, is prominently featured; Hall labels this Freud's most  brilliant discovery. Thought it is a slim volume, the information is dense.  The entire body of Freud's work that Hall is summarizing was originally  published in several thousand pages. To attempt to highlight the more  important passages would result in the entire text colored in yellow  highlighter.

The second theme, a natural concomitant  of the first, is the revelation that Europe just before the turn of the  century--the time and place where Horney was coming of age and beginning  her study of medicine--was, contrary to popular belief, rather sexually  open (at least among the intelligentsia) and a time of great advances in  women's rights. Her life, from her first diary entries in 1898 at age 13 to  her death in 1942, was a struggle to dissect herself to achieve  self-understanding. Her earliest work was a slight divergence from pure  Freudian theory; her later work was a true Horneyan theory, derived less  from the brilliant organization of Freud and more from her life experience  as a woman and a human being. From the beginning, Horney measured the  validity of Freud's theories against her own experience, concluding that  the female experience was worthy of its own body of theoretical work. Quinn  has allowed Horney to be human, painstakingly documenting her genius, as  well as her chaotic personal life that clearly furnished much of the  material for developing her own psychoanalytic theory.	1998-08-23

Through a  careful examination of documents (letters, wills, deeds, contracts, and  other public documents), the author traces the growth of new urban centers  in Europe in the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. The lifeblood and  reason for being for these towns and cities was commerce. Women's lives  were radically changed by the economic demands of production for export.  Both the need for women's labor in creating goods and conducting business  and the partnership aspect that grew within marriages because of this need  resulted in widespread changes in law that allowed women to own property,  conduct business, and participate in the decisions about their lives. The  economic characteristics of the middle ages created the first opportunities  in modern history for women to experience some degree of independence and  begin the centuries-long process of escaping chatteldom.	1998-08-23

She uses excerpts from  the hundreds of interviews she conducted throughout the United States while  preparing this book to prove her theory. Her stages have catchy labels:  Tryout Twenties, Turbulent Thirties, Flourishing Forties, Flaming Fifties,  Serene Sixties. Sheehy's attempt to make meaning of the mature years is  most likely to become an artifact of its era, unable to cross cultures or  time. Her passages depend too heavily on life as it is being lived in the  1990s in the United States of America. With the work of Erikson and Jung on  developmental aging already on the book shelf and thoughtful contributions  by such as Friedan, Schacter-Shalomi and Miller, and others, Sheehy's  contribution is disappointing.	1998-08-23

Using  their concepts of &quot;elderhood&quot; and &quot;the art of life  completion,&quot; Schacter-Shalomi and Miller survey the societal changes  that they believe are synchronistic events that give meaning and purpose to  the burgeoning population of elders in American society and other developed  countries. An increasing number of writers share these men's belief that  the aged are needed to guide humanity in its values, to influence the young  to make the changes that consider the distant future as well as the  present. Rabbi Schacter-Shalomi has spent his adult life studying numerous  spiritual disciplines. He believes that the present easy access to ancient  spiritual teachings that were once passed secretly from one generation of  adepts to the next is for the purpose of allowing large populations to  prepare themselves for their contribution to humanity as wise elders. The  major theme of this work could be said to be the art of lving and dying  with meaning. Going beyond the usual observations of the characteristics of  our rapidly aging population, Schacter-Shalomi and Miller have offered  sound advice on how an individual can find purpose in life beyond  reproduction and career. They even offer specific &quot;Exercises for Sages  in Training.&quot;	1998-08-23

Lifestyle factors and an environment  bombarded with potent, life-altering chemicals seem to be the causes for  breast cancer that science has not yet been able to prove. Read concludes  that social change is the most potent preventative to the rising breast  cancer rates worldwide. Many of the risk factors for breast cancer are  related to delayed childbearing as women get their educations and establish  in careers. Among other startling suggestions, Read proposes that society  offer more support to women so that they may begin having children at an  earlier age. With public and work-site facilities for breastfeeding,  guaranteed educational opportunities for young mothers, and help with  childcare, women would be able to begin their families at a younger age.	1998-08-23

The same unit of  energy that is a part of your body today may, only days before, have been a  part of a bird flying over Beijing or an Ethiopian villager. This  &quot;new&quot; knowledge from modern physics sounds very much like the  Tao--in Eastern phillosophies, the &quot;unifying principle in the universe  to which everything in the world relates.&quot; The tao (lowercase) is the  life path that is in harmony with the universe, the &quot;path with  heart.&quot; Jung believed that all people and all animate and inanimate  objects are linked through a collective unconscious. Synchronicity, he  said, was a connecting principle that manifests through &quot;meaningful  coincidences.&quot; Bolen proposes that synchronicity is the Tao of  psychology; it relates the individual to the totality. She makes good use  of anecdotes to explain Jung's layers of consciousness, the Jungian  analytical tools of amplification and active imagination, and the  difference between causality and synchronicity. Bolen has a gift for making  clear Jungian concepts that seem obtuse or hazy in the hands of other  writers.	1998-08-23

While  historically important as a reflection of the thinking at the time they  were written, some of the essays are artifacts of thought. Skinner's essay,  for example, sought a way to popularize art by a system of reinforcement.  The result was cold, uninteresting, and silly. The true value of the  collection lies in its successful communication of the opposing viewpoints  concerning modern art that were extant in the late 1960s.	1998-08-23

The women as individuals may be  described as admirable, fascinating, witty, and even awesome (check out  Dolores Huerta who has spent most of her adult life as a full-time human  rights activist, living in poverty or near-poverty, while giving birth to  11 children--most of whom are now college graduates--and periodically  catering to the demands of one of her three husbands). A more interesting  aspect of this collection is what these women have in common. They each  find this time in their lives more free, more focused on making a  contribution to society, less focused on physical appearance and pleasing  others, and less concerned (if not unconcerned) with having men in their  lives. Tabra Tunoa, a jewelry designer and manufacturer, said, &quot;You  waste a lot of time in your thirties trying to look twenty and in your  forties trying to look thirty&quot;--one comment from among several in the  interviews which imply that the forties are for clearning up the vestiges  of denial of age, and the fifties are for embracing its gifts. Said Gloria  Steinem, &quot;I learned that to be defiant about age may be better than  despair--it's energizing--but it is not progress.&quot; Rountree has done a  fine job of asking the right questions, eliciting illuminating answers, and  photographing 18 women who are worth hearing from.	1998-08-13

Anticipating an anthology of _stories_, the Paley-ignorant reader  is bewildered, awed, and delighted in turns as Paley's darkly metaphorical  tales reveal her clever humor and, ultimately, her unflagging hope for  humanity. Using common language with an uncommon twist, Paley's  descriptions cause the reader to laugh with familiarity: &quot;The table  was the enameled table common to our class, easy to clean, with wooden  undercorners for indigent and old cockroaches that couldn't make it to the  kitchen sink.&quot; &quot;The Long Distance Runner&quot; is a powerful  allegory about menopause, that mystical time in a woman's life when so much  more is happening than the simple cessation of menstrual flow. Paley  attributes her success as a writer to the wonderful luck of the birth of  the women's movement, which coincided with the publication of her first  stories.	1998-08-13

The title is a line from &quot;Warning,&quot; a poem by Jenny Joseph. Joseph proposes that one of the benefits of aging is doing as one pleases, and what will please her is not just wearing purple, but spitting where she chooses and picking other people's flowers. My mother, herself at the age that Joseph yearns for, found this so offensive that she refused to look at any other part of the book. There are a few pieces that are particularly nice, including Sarah Barnhill's &quot;Near Places, Far Places,&quot; in which a woman entering midlife begins to connect with her mother's values. The volume is riddled with the kind of typographical errors that would have easily yielded to a computer spellcheck, or even a cursory proofing. Though pleasing enough, I am of the opinion that the book is selling as well as it is on the strength of its titillating title and a charming!  cover illustration.	1998-08-12

Lessing has created a character who bridges the midlife transition in a single summer, from typical upper-middle-class British housewifery to corporate executive to older-woman-younger-man romance to denouncing the hair color that masks her age. By the end of Kate's summer, she is not entirely certain who she is, but quite clear who she is not. Lessing is recognized as one of the important writers in the English language, and the body of literature on midlife women is enriched by her genius and wisdom.	1998-08-12

Women gained when their numbers were few relative to the numbers of men, and women's control of property was restricted when it interfered with young men's abilities to make their marks in the world. There is a lot of information and valuable historical perspective; however, the author vacillated between failure to develop some important points and overdiscussion of others. Isolated sections (far too few) were quite good--good writing and good information with a balanced analysis. Banner chose a worthy subject, and she is a good writer.

Picasso's own words, appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated, nor sources given. The reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words. The text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors. Walther's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of Picasso's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings.

(Bruce Willis got the part!) Vonnegut's beautiful phrases are few and far between. His ironic truths are delivered in short, straightforward sentences--a sometimes gentle, sometimes not so gentle confrontation. Vonnegut is in a class by himself. Unlike other satirists, he shows a genuine affection for his characters, reflecting what must be a great love for the human race--despite its foibles that he so expertly identifies. His black comedy is rendered with a sensitivity that elecits tender feelings and fondness for his characters, who are neither heroes nor villains, but people like ourselves who have stubbed their toes walking life's path. His c! omic irreverence always serves to let us know ourselves better, and he leaves no sacred cow unmilked. About the discovery of America in 1492, he says, &quot;Actually, millions of human beings were already living full and imaginative lives on the continent in 1492. That was simply the year in which sea pirates began to cheat and rob and kill them.&quot; BOC is among Vonnegut's finest writings, something of a summary of his first fifty years of experience as a human being.	1998-08-09

I planned to think and study about the art of aging for several years, and then tell how to learn and practice it.&quot; This volume, written when she was in her 70s, is the only effort she ever made to fulfill that ambition. She makes no direct statement about aging except in her Afterword, and there the valiantly borne disappointment is clearly stated: &quot;Our housing is to blame,&quot; she said from her loneliness and separation from her children and grandchildre! n. She blames high-rises, cost of large homes, and socioeconomic events for the phenomena of old people living alone, not being touched, not basking in the daily light of children's smiles. Fisher's stories delight and baffle from time to time, and her view of old age as a lonely time, when one has to halfheartedly figure out what to do with one's time, travels from page to lonely page. It was rather like a black comedy without a punch line.	1998-08-07

Everything one would want to know is included--that is, everything that is available to know. West is not vague in discussing areas of ignorance for the medical community. From the workings of the female organs to the myriad of ills that may befall them to the treatments that are available, everything is presented. At the end of each chapter discussing specific dis-eases of the female organs, West has included a list of specific questions to ask a prospective surgeon. To aid the woman who fears questioning the big daddy in a white coat, West reviews research on doctor-patient communication and gives soun! d advice on communicating effectively and fairly and expecting the same fair treatment from the physician. Among the many books on the market today, I would place this first for the woman weighing her options when hysterectomy has been advised or considered.	1998-08-07

Writing of the purpose of being a woman, Sams gingerly walks the feminist precipice between woman as a reproductive machine and woman as a meaningful contributor to society. She magically does not lose her balance, successfully making the case for women fulfilling a personal and cosmic biological role as creators, with men assigned the role of helpmate and protector. It becomes painfully clear that the tasks that men and women have traditionally performed have not been so much at fault as has the value placed on them by society and the individuals contained within it. Sams is a competent writer with a gift for description. Unlike many spiritual bestsellers, the reader does not have to overcome the distraction of faulty writing in order to receive her powerful message.	1998-08-07

Each week's work includes beautifully written, thought-provoking text, as well as a series of exercises to bring home the point of the week's &quot;lesson.&quot; Cameron designed the program for blocked artists, but anyone who will take the time to follow her text and work through a sampling of the weekly tasks will benefit, even those who protest they are not &quot;creative.&quot; Without writing a poem or painting a canvas--or any of the other activities commonly considered creative--we are nonetheless the creators of our own lives. Anyone determined to avoid change should, at all cost, avoid this book.	1998-08-07

There is a clear and understandable explanation of how a woman's body works and why each part of the female reproductive system is indispensable. Cutler includes sections on health risks following hysterectomy and how a woman can work to offset these risks. I find this information to be invaluable in a serious effort to make the best of a bad situation--the loss of uterus and ovaries. The text has a tendency to become very dense and sometimes requires a reread to grasp meaning. Generally, she has succeeded in making technical information on hysterectomy available to the educated layperson, while maintaining the scientific integrity that makes the book equally valuable to physicians and other medical professionals. A bonus is her casual mention, in two or three places, of the importance of spiritual health in managing one's physical health. W! est's excellent book, &quot;Hysterectomy Hoax&quot; is easier to read, but if you want ALL the details, Cutler has done the job beautifully.	1998-08-06

I discovered my own relationship with my sister (and vestiges of the dominant/subordinate in our relationship continue well into our adulthood).

Calling itself a &quot;complete guide,&quot; and thus possibly the only book some women might read, it could certainly be better. All of the issues of menopause are covered, but rather flatly. Despite the attempt to be up to date with the addition of alternative therapies (mostly herbs), there were a few incidences of inexcusably bad information (e.g., depression after a hysterectomy is incidental and unrelated to the physical experience of the surgery; and the marks around a woman's mouth as she ages are caused from puckering the mouth to smoke a cigarette). It may suffice as a comfort book for some women, depending on how much comfort they need. There are so many really good books out there, I don't see why this one is even still in print. Take a look at &quot;Ourselves Growing Older&quot; from the same folks who brought out &quot;Our Bodies, Ourselves.&quot; A really great book with a l! ot of references to other really great books.	1998-08-06

Her causal position is based on work by respected British astronomer Percy Seymour, which found significant correlation between certain electromagnetic energy patterns and certain aspects (squares, oppositions, and conjunctions) among planets at the time of birth. Seymour wrote a book claiming to have proved the scientific validity of astrology on this basis. I found Clow's key life passages somewhat faulty in discussions of Saturn and Uranus, but her discussion of Chiron held great personal significance. Clow wrote to a general audience, but a basic understanding of astrology would allow the reader to reap more benefit. The inclusion of charts that allow the reader to find personal planetary positions and thus relate personally to her descriptions increased readability and interest. This is a use! ful addition ot the literature on human life cycles and their meaning.	1998-08-06

Walker's style of allowing the reader to see the story from the eyes of each of the characters is novel and effective, inviting the reader to view the situation from all perspectives. Walkers's character, Tashi, involves an ever-widening circle of family, friends and acquaintances in the solution of her problems that arise as a result of having her external sexual organs crudely severed in a tribal ritual. Everyone's life revolves around Tashi. As the story evolves, the reader realizes that everyone's life is Tashi. What happens to the least of us, happens to all of us. It's difficult to settle into a book that begins at the end and travels almost randomly through time. Walker's eclectic non-use of punctuation is at times distracting, at others, helpful. In the end, the book's inconsistencies and looseness seems suitable. It suits Tashi.	1998-08-06

What appears to be a picture book turns out to be a witty, entertaining view of the life of Lady Cottington through handwritten diary entries that begin in childhood, when she &quot;presses&quot; her first fairy. The reader follows her life, as she slaps the pages shut on unwitting fairies, pressing them forever between the pages of her pressed fairy book (originally intended for pressing flowers). The authors, in a footnote, assure us that the squished fairies are only psychic impressions, since fairies cannot be killed. At the end of this two-hour, entertaining read, it is clear that Lady Cottington's 103 years have more meaning than pictures of flattened fairies and a lifetime of refusing vulgar suitors. A subtle picture of an interesting woman has been drawn, and many re-readings will be necessary to find the nuances. The book has the appearance of a coffee-table book, the illustrations of a fine picture book, and much!  more subtlety of meaning than such a book ought to have.	1998-08-06

Encyclopedic in scope, every conceivable issue surrounding age, personal or political, is covered. The book stemmed from Friedan's personal journey in facing her own aging and therefore covers well the personal and introspective issues that may be left out of a book devoted to the &quot;problems&quot; of aging. The overall theme is one of aging as a necessary and to-be-relished stage of life, with its own tasks, rather than being simply the end of life. There is much repetition of material from one section of the book to the next, which is sometimes distracting. However, each section and each chapter is a stand-alone essay, giving the work a value as a reference. Awesome. Inspiring.	1998-08-05

It is liberating to read someone else's unabashedly personal search for the meaning of her relationship with her sister, not hesitating to criticize existing material based on her need to see it from the perspective of a late-life lesbian with five children and a younger sister with whom she has never had a satisfactory relationship. I, in turn, am critical of her narrow viewpoint, but applaud the prodigious effort in bringing together everything that could be found on sisterhood from sources that would yield archetypal images. It was illuminating to read how Freud was a firstborn and derived his theories from his personal process and that Adler was a secondborn and, likewise, developed his birth-order theories based on his personal experiences. The section discussing Greek myths wil! l be difficult for anyone who does not know them well, because Downing talks about them but never summarizes them--it was rather like listening to someone talk about a movie. I never grasped the connection between sisterhood and death that Downing subscribes to and said that Freud subscribed to. The chapters on depth psychology and feminist psychology I found good reading, relying as they did on the experiences of real people, rather than archetypes. Being frozen in a very painful symbiosis with my own sister, I practiced transference during the first half of the book, knowing full well that I was reading the excuses of an elder sister. As I progressed through the pages and forgave Downing for her birth order, the information became more interesting. Downing proposed that she would show how her survey of sisterhood thought applied to the larger sisterhood of all women. She never quite succeeded in that effort, as her own very personal struggle permeated every page through the ! final entry.	1998-08-02

Though the reader addressed is one who aspires to art as a profession, much of what Bayles and Orland offer is as applicable to any undertaking: &quot;Artmaking involves skills that can be learned. ...

Not only is her journey one of hard-won insight, it is also a description of a real-life pilgrimage to sacred places. Her pilgrimage experience creates an archetype for menopausal women. Standing barefoot on the High Altar at Glastonbury, she experiences the merging of God and Goddess--the divine flow of masculine and feminine. A year later she looks back and knows that at that moment she was experiencing her last bleed--it was her MOMENT of menopause. Her integration of the Grail story creates a work that should be just as meaningful to men as women, particularly the last half of the book. Powerful, comforting, loving. Each time I finish a book, I think of someone I know that would benefit from reading it. Crossing to Avalon goes on my list for &qu! ot;Everyone Over 40 and Nearly Everyone Else.&quot;	1998-08-02

What is considered state of the art in Britain, France, Australia, and the United States is somewhat different from country to country. Drugs and treatments available in one country are unavailable in others. The pet drug in each country is one produced by a drug company headquartered in that country. The United States, of course, comes out as champion in the medicalization of menopause. Greer did not hesitate to put forth her pet theories in the midst of statistics and reports of double-blind studies. She is very much present in her writing, and the book greatly benefits. Greer believes the second half of life is about becoming spiritual, and the second half of her book is her testimonial of her midlife passage, liberally sprinkled with testimonials from diaries and novels dating back to the 1700s. The reader experiences her passage, from the first chapters with her femini! sm in full view as she lambasts the medicalization of menopause to the final chapters when she describes her joy on being on the other side of fifty: &quot;Before, I felt less on greater provocation; I lay in the arms of young men who loved me and felt less bliss than I do now. What I felt then was hope, fear, jealousy, desire, passion, a mixture of real pain, and real and fake pleasure, a mash of conflicting feelings, anything but this deep still joy. I needed my lovers too much to experience much joy in our travailed relationships. I was too much at their mercy to feel much in the way of tenderness; I can feel as much in a tiny compass now when I see a butterfly still damp and crinkled from the chrysalis taking a first flutter among the brambles.&quot; For those among us who approach our climacteric &quot;alone,&quot; Greer makes clear that the relationship with the self can be the most joyous and satisfying of all relationships.	1998-08-02

Picasso and Braque, working closely together in Paris between 1906 and 1908, are credited as the creators of this style. Cubism was the major step toward Abstractionist painting that came to dominate twentieth-century art, preceded only by Cezanne, whom Picasso credited as its inspiration. Cooper credits the Cubists with the invention of collage, examples of which are included in this beautifully illustrated volume. With 48 full-page color reproductions of important Cubist paintings with accompanying discussion, and an additional 36 illustrations in black and white, this book offers a useful history and summary of Cubism and the artists who practiced it. A better-than-average addition to the library of new low-cost paperback art books that too frequently are plagued with an indifferent text.	1998-08-02

As Anais Nin did, Sexton attempted to seduce her therapists and at least once succeeded. She envied Sylvia Plath's suicide, and eventually staged her own, having planned it for years. She was in therapy most of her adult life, and this account of her life would be a useful read for any student of psychology. Sexton's problems were much the same as those of any average American woman, so one likes her and identifies with her. But she did not handle her difficulties so well, and so one comes away feeling a bit saner, a bit more competent. Middlebrook succeeds in making a compelling life into a compelling read.	1998-08-02

Lipsey's theme is that &quot;Twentieth century art embodied a stronger and wiser spirituality than we have fully acknowledged,&quot; and his choice of artists is governed not by the degree of their fame, but by the degree to which they succeeded in embodying a contemporary spirituality. Modern art is a statement of philosophy that differs from previous eras, Lipsey posits, in part because &quot;t! wentieth-century artists have for the most part worked individually and without formal adherence to religious or spiritual traditions.&quot; Lipsey's careful and thoughtful exploration of the spiritual in twentieth-century art has enormously enlarged this reader's ability to see abstract art and benefit from the experience.	1998-08-01

Fitch's work is creditably balanced in an attempt to sort fact from fiction in Nin's writings. Though some considered her a pathological liar, Nin considered herself simply the creator of her own life. Her Diaries, the most widely known of her writings, suffered, some believe, from her extensive editing. Though Nin claimed the editing was for the purpose of protecting the many players in her life, there is evidence that much of it was simply so that she could be remembered as she wished to be. Sculptor Isamu Noguchi was among her New York circle, and legendary writer Henry Miller was her lover in youth and dear friend in age. These were only two among perhaps hundreds of important figures of her time in literature, art, and psychotherapy, whom she counted as friends and acquaintances and who give a broad appeal to a study of her life. Artists, writers, and those in the various ! fields of psychology and psychiatry can be informed by the way she lived her life and the people she drew into it.	1998-08-01
