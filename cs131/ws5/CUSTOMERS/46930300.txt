I just finished Playland Poems and find them resonating in my head and my heart. Packer's style is jazzy and she has honed her style and really found her voice in this magnificent collection. She has sections on 9/11 and on the rapidly changing 42nd street era that make me mourn the demise of the porn area - a feeling of nostalgia pervades the book despite the often rough and tough material. These are poems you feel coursing through the chambers of your heart.	2005-09-29

But a Sirowitz poem does, in fact, address the quotidian issues that drive us crazy and in this respect, his poetry does help us deal with our problems. Each poem is carefully crafted - deceptively so. But just try writing one! A wonderful read - I have purchased several copies for friends both into poetry and not. All have been delighted.	2005-09-22

Markus has managed to convey her own excitement at relating such an intriguing story and did what a good author should do - made me want to delve into these poets' lives and their poetry even more.<br />Some of the speculation I did not agree with such as EBB's father not wanting his children to marry because of possible African blood. The birth of Pen Browning should have eradicated that concern. We may never understand the strange, cruel elder Barrett and fortunately, Dared and Done doesn't hinge on the theory. I did want to know more about the conniving Sophia Eckley - her cause of death for example, since she played such a huge role in the Browning marriage. I was also curious about EBB's illness - oddly, we never do get a diagnosis - only her maintenance cure of morphine and ether.<br />Remarkably,  EBB had the greater reputation as a poet during the Barrett-Browning marriage with Robert Browning for many years being considered the lesser poet. That can make for trouble in the most loving of marriages and re-witnessing the devotion these two gifted poets demonstrated repeatedly is both exceptional and inspiring.	2003-05-04

How we have all felt the all-embracing satisfaction of:<br />love fulfilled...<br />fireflies leisurely await<br />the sunrise<br />or the pain of finding oneself alone:<br />winter surf<br />now it dashes against<br />me alone<br />or the intensity of frustration:<br />shall I betray him<br />or let him betray me?<br />the shrike's shrill cry<br />Each poem is a pulsing heart. Don't miss a beat.	2002-02-02

I have read it so often that I had to buy another copy as the pages of my original fell out! Like most good things in life, this is best savoured slowly - over and over and over...	2002-02-02
US	46930300	R2OWFEM45FNM3U	0786862424	988755567	Seeds From a Birch Tree: Writing Haiku and The Spiritual Journey	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Engaging	While I don't subscribe to the 5-7-5 formula that Strand insists on, I find this book very instructive and inspiring. Strand invites the reader into nature as refuge, as spiritual path, and the writing of haiku as an expression of this experience. It has been a book that I turn to during those dry spells that we all fall into and it never fails to ignite the magic spark of \\"ordinary mind\\".	2002-02-02

Each poem has crystalline clarity and shines like a full moon. One that stays in my head and my heart is:<br />Looking out over the bay,<br />I see clouds of cold rain<br />Summoning winter,<br />And hear the wind in the pines<br />Whisper its name.<br />Ah!	2002-02-02

A must-have.	2001-12-25

I perused &quot;Nine Gates&quot;<br />whilst wandering around a bookstore and bought it without my usual &quot;is it worth it? which book has it knocked off my list...&quot;<br />The book is a poem - the essays weave together, speaking to me as both reader and writer. Hirshfield turns the poetic essay into a magnificent breathtaking tapestry.<br />A rich and elegant work. I highly recommend it.	2001-10-15

A must for any poet interested in writing tanka.<br />A well-crafted, magnificent translation.	2001-10-15

One of the hotly debated issues is whether or not the &quot;kigo&quot; or season-word still has a legitimate standing in modern haiku. The existence of &quot;saijiki&quot; or season-word lists and the attempts to create saijiki applicable to regions beyond Japan would seem to indicate that the season-word will stay around for quite awhile.<br />The sheer volume of truly transcendent haiku with kigo will not just evaporate and many haijin still utilise the kigo in haiku as well as in renga/renku experiments for which awareness of season is essential.	2001-10-15

I love both reading and writing renga/renku and other collaborative poetry endeavours. That said, I don't recall any of my collaborators in poetry not owning the Haiku Almanac. It is indispensable and has William Higginson's amazing ability to create a reference book equally valuable to the already published professional and the curious novice.<br />Higginson provides a wealth of examples and manages to tie them together despite their diversities. Pure joy!	2001-10-15

Left alone to my own vices one afternoon at a friend's loft, I happened upon A Haiku Garden which I devoured with delight and then made an excuse for my friend to invite me over again.<br />The woodcut reproductions are priceless and a source of inspiration to a non-artistic poet. A wonderful &quot;tea table&quot; book and a perfect gift. In fact, I plan to buy a copy for myself!	2001-10-15

Between that and the compassion that translates with the work, this volume has to be in the curriculum of all lovers of poetry.<br />Truly zen in action.	2001-10-15

This is a wonderful book for the novice writer, reader AND teacher of haiku. Higginson manages to fit a decent representation of haiku (Japanese masters as well as African-American, Beat, and multi-lingual)as well as a  brief history of related Japanese genres and &quot;season word&quot;  lists.<br />Higginson definitely whets the appetite for even more information  about and examples of haiku. An indispensable addition to any haiku and  haiku-related library.	1998-11-23
