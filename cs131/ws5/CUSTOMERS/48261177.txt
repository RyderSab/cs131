He uses his extensive experience and skill in this field to raise some excellent issues covering the entire globe as it relates to American foreign policy. Additionally, Dr. Kissinger writes in a manner which allows him to fully utilize his best trait as an author: his ability to philosophize. His insights provoke deep, deep thought on the part of the reader, or, in this case, the listener. My only complaint is that, this being an audio cassette, it is narrated by someone other than the author and it is abridged. Personally, I would buy the book format of this. But if you feel the need not to read, consider this alternative.	2001-06-18

Although most people probably understand that Nixon's biggest contribution to this world was NOT having his middle name as a namesake for a supporting character from &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; we could all probably use a little reminding every now and again. This book serves this task remarkably. In his memoirs, Nixon basically pours out most of his life, and greatly improves his image with objective readers, in my opinion. For those who are not aware of anything else involving Nixon other than Watergate, they will be intrigued at his relationship with his family, his political &quot;Gusto,&quot; his &quot;Checkers speech,&quot; his extremely Historic trip to China, and much, much more. This book is one that I heartily recommend to all who might read this review.	2001-06-12

Appropriately, the first story is called &quot;Rhubarb&quot;. In it, Keillor basically gives his take on the history of rhubarb and tells how the plant affected its discoverers. Next, Keillor ventures into the &quot;Sweet Corn&quot; market by explaining how the vegetable saved, and ruined at the same time, the relationship between a mother and her son. Next comes &quot;The Sun's Gonna Shine Someday&quot;, a story in which Clarence Bunsen rises above a miserable week. And finally, &quot;Yellow Ribbon&quot; explains how a teenager uses the opportunity to get away from Lake Wobegon to understand &quot;his people&quot;, as well as himself, better.

The second story is &quot;Nostalgia&quot;, a somewhat forgettable but pleasant story about the pleasures and heartaches of nostalgia as they relate to one specific family. &quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; is Keillor's take as to the significance of the famed tree all over the world during December. &quot;Pageant&quot; is the story of how Karl Krebsbach was forced into taking over Lake Wobegon Lutheran's annual Christmas Pageant. Finally, &quot;Messy Shoes&quot; is Keillor's personal description of his love for the city of Seattle.

Jobhunting is a hilarious take on Keillor's search for his first writing job, and &quot;You're not the Only One&quot; shows that we all go through annoying moments in life and we should be grateful that it is not worse and that we are not alone in our struggles in this world.

Then comes &quot;Prophet&quot;, Keillor's special take on the responsibility of knowing &quot;the truth&quot;. &quot;The six labors of Father Wilmer&quot; is a terrific story of a priest who has had it with certain church members. &quot;Fertility&quot; isn't what the title would suggest it is, but it serves to show again that Garrison Keillor brings to the table both in style, and ability, what no one else can. This is another great cassette.	2001-01-21

This cassette series has everything fans of Keillor could possibly want from brilliant, unique stories to sharp, witty skits to wonderfully appropriate music for Halloween. The best thing, in my opinion, on this series, however, is Keillor's unsurpassed reading of Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;The Raven&quot;. To sum up, this cassette series is enjoyable year around and is a must-buy for any fan of Garrison Keillor and &quot;A Prarie Home Companion&quot;.	2001-01-21

Starting with the beginning of Richard Nixon's second term, Kissinger goes into stunning detail by describing the immense frustrations in trying to stop the war, not only with Vietnam, but also with Cambodia and Laos. He goes on to discuss &quot;The Year of Europe&quot;, a soon to be defunct policy about American action in Europe in 1973. Naturally, the Year of Europe was mortally wounded by Watergate. The Watergate scandal politically forced Nixon to make Kissinger, one of the most Popular people in America, The New Secretary of State. In that role, Kissinger continued and extended his influence in such matters as SALT, and a hugely surprising war between Israel and an Egyptian-Syrian coalition. He discusses his gradual high respect for Anwar Sadat, and his mother-son like relationship with Golda Meir. Most importantly, he discusses his interactions with the soon to resign Richard Nixon. This book does its best work by teaching respect for foreign policy leaders who are in almost impossible positions and who must find a way to make their country safer in the world.	2001-01-10
