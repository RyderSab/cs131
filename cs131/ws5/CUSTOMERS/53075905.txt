Summer Island is beautifully told, and the characters are realistic. They are flawed and imperfect and lovable all the same.<br />My one and only complaint has to do with the gratuitous love scene. I don't like anything gratuitous in a book, and the lovemaking scene on the dock seemed just that to me. Thrown in. As if the author felt compelled to have one just for the sake of having one. The rest of the book was about love and healing of relationships. This scene was just about [making love] and seemed very out of place.<br />But that's a small criticism. The book is certainly worth reading.	2001-06-06

Janie's father, Garrett, expects that Lady Beth will want to be waited on hand and foot, but Beth surprises him by moving into a tumbledown cabin. As Beth settles into her new life, her feelings for Garrett grow while she fends off the mayor's hot pursuit.<br />&quot;With more emphasis on the role of the church in the developing West and deeper religious introspection for the main characters, Hatcher easily shifts to a new market with a title that will appeal to Tracie Peterson's fans. For all collections.&quot; (November 2000)	2000-11-04

This book is about the devastation wrought because of sexual sin and lies told in the aftermath. Neither Jade nor Tanner are immoral people but both  they and Tanner's mother make decisions that harm the guilty and innocent  alike. I thought this book clearly showed the consequences of wrong choices  and ignoring the voice of God.<br />This book also shows that God is a God of  forgiveness and second chances. When we confess our sins, He forgives them  and puts them as far away as east is from west. Sometimes we have to live  with the consequences forever, even when we're forgiven. And sometimes the  door is opened to something even better.<br />In addition to the above, the  reader will learn a lot about the erosion of religious freedom in America  today. For that alone, I would recommend this book to others.<br />Bravo, Ms.  Kingsbury, for a beautiful story.	2000-08-21
US	53075905	R2A4C4AY79ROPH	1578561523	477624312	The Shepherd's Voice	Books	5	16	16	N	N	&quot;Keeps the pages turning until the very end.&quot;	&quot;Capturing the essence of the early 1930s, author Robin Lee Hatcher  crafts an endearing story about a young shepherdess who rescues a wayward  soul in her latest work, THE SHEPHERD'S VOICE. At first heroine Akira  Macauley simply has pity on the penniless vagabond she finds collapsed on  the road. Gabriel--a man accused and convicted of murder by his own father  many years before--responds like a shriveled plant coming back to life  under her care. As Gabriel is returned to his childhood faith and is healed  from the scars of the past, Akira begins to realize the &quot;diamond in  the rough&quot; she's found. To Hatcher's credit, the reader not only gets  a strong sense of the Depression era's severity, but in contrast, an  impression of a woman of faith who persists in believing against all odds.  This is a romance rooted more in earthly realities than fairy tale   fantasies, as trials come to test the faith of both Akira and Gabriel, with  injustices of the past beginning to arise and Gabriel facing possible  imprisonment once again. Hatcher has a real warmth in her writing style and  the relationship between the characters comes across as natural and honest,  rather than contrived and superficial. There is an authentic luster to the  story, which gives the reader a genuine feeling, together with a plot that  is suspenseful enough to keep the pages turning until the very end.&quot;  --Christian Retailing (8/19/00)	2000-08-20

May God forgive us. I have read every  single one of Ms. Rivers' novels, and she never fails to move me in some  way.
