This one is an amateur work. I believe that lisa jackson can write better. In this one, her characters were one-dimensional, I mean the cliches one more time! The plot was somehow promising however the end was ridiculous.  I felt that page by page it became more and more unrealistic and slow going. In the end my only feeling was dissatisfaction. There were lots of mistakes, after sometime I gave up counting them. Obviously Ms Jackson had not done her work, particulary for post-trauma period. I almost hated the heroine by the end of the book. She was really shallow, without any moral code or ethics. I wanted to ask if an accident can change the character. A person like that can do the same again and again without giving any damn! <br /> <br />Ms Jackson shows the failures of main character \\"Marla Cahill\\" throughout the book. I don't want to spoil the book but the character of \\"real heroin\\" was worse than her. A combination of sluttishness and greediness. She was calculating and self-seeker. A real opportunist. We learn that she is greedy for money and power, totally covetous. An unpleasant heroin. <br /> <br />I must say that so far I have not been overly impressed.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

Amanda and Tristan were opposite characters but made for each other, both were interesting. Amanda was a gorgeous dancer, beautiful and fascinating, Tristan was not the same old hero.  <br />I gave it four stars because I like my suspenses fast. I think the story line is a little bit slow paced yet terrific. There were some steriotype sections in this book which were drawbacks, however I like Ms Andersen's work and I'll keep reading her books. <br /> <br />	2005-06-26

It's not often that we see both of those important facets in the same book. The most important part is that this one gives real life characters - not the same old cliche- Obsessed provides us with a solid base and allows us to be totally immersed in the story from the first chapter. Give it a try. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-26

I started to read Ms Andersen's books with   Exposure and I have read all books of her. I can still say that Exposure is the greatest. (Unfortunately starting with Baby series Ms. Andersen changed her style!) <br />The heroine, gorgeous Emma has a cute little three-year- old little girl\\"Grace\\" and the hero, small town cop Elvis Aaron has a disfigured face and a hook. Emma and Grace are on the run. The characters of Ms Andersen are usually entertaining, the characters of Exposure are great example for her works: Suspense is weak but romance is very satisfying. I highly recommend this book. It's a must read and a keeper. <br />	2005-06-26

First of all, I am an avid reader of SEP and she is one of my favourite authors. Unfortunately, she is not quick as an author and each time we have to impatiently wait to read her recent book for almost two years. Because of her previous books, as a reader I am somehow spoiled and have \\"gold standards\\". <br /> <br />Therefore I personaly expected to read something more exciting than \\"Ain't She Sweet\\".  <br /> <br />There is no funny thing in this book. Other reviewers emphasized that this one was supposed to be a comedy. Where is the comedy part? At least Dream a little dream was bitter sweet, this one is only bitter! <br /> <br />I am sure that the loyal fans of SEP will start protesting against my review and it will probably  receive some negative votes. Why does this have only  2 stars? It lacked a definitive emotional depth and touch that I know SEP is capable of. The reasons that I gave this book two stars are; <br /> <br />1. Same old same old. As some clever readers have already pointed out the storyline is a combination of \\"It had to be you\\" and \\"Dream a little dream\\". Obviously a shallow attempt to repeat. <br /> <br />2. The main characters had been unsuccessfully drawn and  the main plot was weak. Sugar Beth is OK but I could not feel any sympathy toward her.  <br /> <br />3. I always like the secondary characters in her books and no other writer can do it as magnificient as her (For example; Torie and Dex in Lady be good, Bobby Tom's mother in Heaven Texas, Kevin's mother in This heart of mine etc).  Too much effort had been spent on the secondary characters (Winnie and her husband, Seawillows so on...) and the result is futile.  <br /> <br />4. Just from the beginning I disliked Winnie the whiner and felt no sympathy at all. Sugar Beth's childhood has been somehow abused. Her father had another affair with the mother of Winnie (why we did not hear of her in the book is also another question) and just 3 months after the death of Sugar Beth's mother, he married her. Worst of all, the jerk father made two women pregnant at the same year. Sugar Beth had to go to the same school with her secret (!) sister. Please correct me if I am wrong, is that the moral code? The reason of ex-shabby behaviours of Sugar Beth is obvious.   <br />    <br />5. The drama part was very heavy and I felt miserable. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. I was so irritated by the people of the small town. Their IQ's were an average 100. Everyone was interested in the past and/or what happened more than 15 years ago. I grew up neither in a small town nor in USA. SEP is a world-wide popular author, that's why we the readers from the rest of the world expect more.   <br /> <br />6. I did not understand why everybody else (apart from Colin and Winnie)  held a grudge with Sugar Beth. What she did only harmed herself. Is the reason that she left the town and did not keep in touch sufficient to be enemies with Seawillows till deathbed? Why  did they hate her and want a revenge?  <br /> <br />7. The only person who has some logic in this book was Gigi, the 13-year-old daughter of Winnie. <br />  <br />8. Sugar Beth's past was full of experiences. SEP did not focus on showing us what was exclusive and remarkable with Colin. Nothing new, not even a first real love! Because she had already had the love of her life with her third and 70-year-old-husband. I could cope with the fact that she thought of him as a father figure (since she was deprived of the father-daughter relationship). No, SEP again disappointed me. What kind of role did  the mentally impaired 51- year-old step daughter play? SEP clearly wanted to show Sugar Beth's positive sides and awaking. Again another futile attempt! <br /> <br />9.    Somewhere in the middle of the book Sugar Beth told Colin that she lost the chance of mummyhood due to an ectopic pregnancy and some additional medical problems that she had when she was 22 years old. Everybody can experience such a tragedy, but what I can not understand why Sugar Beth never expressed her feelings towards that fact and how she got pregnant in the end (I mean without any modern medical help)? <br /> <br />10.   SEP's publisher and avid readers made the book look like sooo super and I feel that I am cheated. May be you might enjoy reading it. It just wasn't for me. SEP will be still an auto-buy for me even though this one was such a disappointment. I hope that she does not keep changing her unique way of writing and does not take part in the same path with the current authors who write easily digested meaningless books. <br /> <br />	2005-03-09

I totally agree with some reviewers who said that Ms Lowell's recent works were weak and lack of spirit. I, personally gave up buying her books after Donovan series. When I checked the attitudes of other reviewers, I realized that this is a kind of trend actually. Donovan series are supposed to be good, however too much info about gemology (obviously she has lots of books on this issue) is really beyond boring. One reader had emphasized that Ms Lowell is either very good or very poor. I completely agree with her. The earlier books (even the naive ones) of Ms Lowell are much better than the recent ones. <br />I could not see any character development in this one.

The main characters are Poppy and  Griffin. The drama of Heather is the main event, and  the storyline is related with solving secrets of Heather.  <br />I could not decide whether I really liked this book or not. I gave it four stars because there are lots of rubbish stories on the bookshelves and this one deserves some stars if you compare to others.  <br /> <br />One early morning, the FBI agents come to Heather Malone's and Mircah's & Mircah's two daughters home in Lake Henry with an arrest warrant and demand that she is Lisa Matlock from California who is wanted for a murder. The events start, everybody including lifepartner Mircah realizes that they know nothing about her. Heather totally refuses to talk and never open her innerself as if she is dump. <br />Her friend Poppy, a paraplegic, determines to help to whole family.  <br />The problem of the book is the ending. I could not understand what happened at the end of the book. Of course, it was clear but somehow lacked of deep emotion. Just like that, It ended! I am still curious about so many things. Such as why there had to be a soap opera chapter in the end?   <br /> <br />Ms Delinsky usually repeats and gilds the sentences unnecessarily. As a result, the book has 500 pages. As I pointed out before, better than the average. <br /> <br />	2004-12-06

I wanted to give four and a half stars, because some parts were relatively slow.<br />I must emphasize that the storyline is nothing fancy or deep. As a matter of fact \\"Dreaming of a stranger\\" is a pleasant book about ordinary characters. The story starts in 1981 and goes to 1994 with a song name (selections from top songs lists) regarding each chapter. You will find pieces from real lives, however they are not trivia, just the reality... Great friendship, love, marriage, motherhood, betrayal, divorce and again finding true love... Sounds boring but astonishingly well-written. Another example showing that Irish writes it better!<br />It was an excellent read, and I enjoyed it all the way through. Well worth the time, I will definitely be reading more by this author in the future!	2004-12-04

This is my first Tess Gerritsen book and I extremely enjoyed reading it. Fast, interesting, excellent. Villain is the most horrible ever.   In Boston, a talented killer finds his victims who are previous rape victims. His target is removing the uterus and then cut their throats.   The trauma surgeon of Pilgrim Hospital, Dr Catherine Cordell -now lives in Boston- killed a trainee doctor Andrew Capra who had tried to rape and kill her with this identical style in Savannah.  Ms Gerritsen's heroin is actually Jane Rizzoli \\"the only female detective of the department who has emotional turmoil and self confidence problem\\". Rizzoli is great.  Another homicide detective Thomas Moore falls for Catherine, so there is also a little bit romance.  Rizzoli and Moore start their investigation on these copycat murders.  Page by page I was so eager to learn upcoming events. I  must say that I could not put it down. Ms Gerritsen is a brilliant author and I can not understand how I missed her works. She is a doctor actually, that's why she is quite capable of decribing the medical terminology in a smooth way. Her style is easy to follow. Fast pace, great characters, magnificent storyline... What I reader wants more? Highly recommended...	2004-11-25

Stunning!<br />The touch of Tami Hoag makes even the steriotype fascinating.<br />What I most liked about this book was the description of the interesting swamps of Louisiana. I have never been there, since Hoag is really successful in storytelling, I could feel the atmosphere.<br />The main characters have lots of emotional baggage. Serena is a psychologist and returns to Louisiana to deal with her grandfather. There is a chemical company that aims to have a factory on that region. They wants to buy the Sheridan property. Shelby (twinsister of Serena) is eager to sell the property, she and her husband are too greedy to have everything completed without Serena's interruption.<br />Lucky is the best of the best hero that I haven't read in a suspense novel for a long time. He has lots of misgivings, emotional turmoil and is slightly lack of self-esteem. The romantica and relationship of the characters are well-described and adventurous.<br />In spite of its shortcomings (written in 1992)it is relatively great, give it a try. I gave 5 stars because it is belivable and not boring. Ideal for vacations.<br />Have a nice read.	2004-11-25

I was so enthusiastic to read it because of glossy reviews. What a disappointment... This is a US government suspense. Consequently,  the main idea was good in the beginning. The factor of ethnic flavour (the heroin is Asian) is also something new in this genre.   [...] Ms Low repeats every single detail so many times that that made me almost thrown up. After some time I gave up counting to read how many times the bad guys tortured, raped etc. the heroin. How can it be possible to have operated perfectly after what happened her skin, face, body? Plastic surgery has lots of limitations Ms. Low.   Actually I found the heroin totally dumbfounded. The hero is irritating and his fetish about long long hair is gross.  Is it really possible if a person really is unaware of herself throughout 10 years and then remembers everything in bed with her \\"husband\\"?  This book needs a good editing, but it is too late. Normally Avon is quite precise in this matters, perhaps they were in a hurry. Despite what I wrote, I am planning to give this author another try, maybe I will order her first or next work.

In general all books of this genre are quite similar to each other and unfortunately few authors are succesful.  To support the first work of the author, I gave it a five star. I hope that she won't repeat herself in upcoming works.  You will find one of the worst villians ever as ex(?)husband of the heroin. Caroline and her son Tom had been abused several years and finally found the chance to escape from police husband/father and subsequently survived. Just after the meeting of hero and heroin, villain husband finds out they are still alive. He is quite obsessive for his son Tom, and starts actually hunting.

I wasted too much time reading this novel and  have not understood yet what the author was thinking? This one was my first from Linda Castillo, and I was eager to read it since the story seemed to me so different.    <br />There are lots of logical and editorial mistakes in the book, after some time I just gave up. I must say that I forced myself to finish it. As I pointed out, the plot was very promising, however page by page became higly predictable. This book is not terrible but I would not recommend it. The chemistry betweeen Dr Eli Barnes and Adam Boedecker seems really forced and almost 3/4 of the book there is nothing regarding that. I also would like to raise some questions if Eli is a real doctor? As far as I know medical doctors should be more clever and cautious. The first half of the book is unnecessarily long and the plot suffers. The villain was an unconvincing one.  <br />I have still lots of questions: What happened to Roth Pharma and Peter Roth, was Kevin really in this play? If so, why he helped in the end? Please Ms. Castillo enlighten us. <br /> <br />In conclusion, save the money and time.	2004-10-31

I have been eagerly waiting to read his next book just after My name is Red. His excellent style has been getting further more than one step in each book. This is not a historical story, just pure reality! His trademark \\"the conflict about the difference between east and west\\" now shines in another city; Kars, situating on the far north-east of Turkey. His search for identity and reality leads to curiosity. This is about what it means to be western/eastern. The main character Ka, a middle-aged poet actually, returns to Istanbul to attend his mother's funeral and learns the strange events in eastern Turkey: Suicides is getting popular among girls forbidden to wear their head scarves at school and that makes him travel to Kars, a small city near the Russian border. The author describes Kars in a poetic way, after Ottoman and Russian glories, the city was totally abandoned by West. He finds Kars in poverty surrounding by political Islamists, Kurdish separatists idealist students, left-wing theater groups and of course their ideologies. Orhan Pamuk has a remarkable reputation all around the world. This book seems somehow so Turkish. You may find difficult to read and follow particulary some of the events, however the unique style of Pamuk makes the story awesome. One more tip for the non Turkish readers; there is a word game in this book. Ka (The name of main character), Kar(it means \\"Snow\\" in Turkish) and Kars (the name of the city). Breathtakingly intelligent.	2004-09-08

This one probably is one of the preliminary works of her post-pure-romance era. So, in that aspect it is different from classical Sandra Brown. Actually I had read this book more than 10 years ago and enjoyed it. This summer, when I had nothing new to read I gave it a second chance. I have read probably all of Sandra Brown books and somewhow this one still worths rereading. Schyler is a  great character. Most readers may find Cash a little bit irritating but I, personally liked them together. Cash is highly problematic. As I mentioned before, the scenes between them is a mixture of good and bad. Cash and schyler are remarkable. Warning: Don't hate Cash throughout the pages, particulary his dirty talk and womanising! Please keep in mind that Slow Heat In Heaven is not a romance book but  it is still hot.	2004-09-07

Even though she has lots of better ones, Crush is overall a satisfying well paced emotional thriller. Whilst reading this book, I immediately remembered another story by Susan Andersen whose name is Obsessed (probably was published in the beginning of 1990s). That's why it lacks of some originality. However, Dr Rennie Newton and  Wick Threadgill were remarkable characters. That's obviously is the talent of the romance backrounded author.

I have to admit that I am totally puzzled by the high ratings this book has received. Unfortunately the main story line and romance was totally lack of attraction and humour. The author had been unable to do even an average character development. Mainly, what I can not understand about this book is everybody asks or knows everybodys IQs. Perhaps, that's the problem of the author. I, myself got fed up with counting this issue after 11th question referring this subject in this book. <br />I guess, It would be more clever to write a complete book about Schuyler who is actually the most interesting and dominant character in this book. Actually, the main characters are far beyond being the main ones. I have not understood anything about the relationship between Leo and Lily, in fact that was not even a relationship. No chemistry, no spirit at all. The first 100 pages of this book was a total mess. When Schuyler came back to his house, the plot a little bit became interesting, however the romance between Schuyler and Caroline and also Schuyler's relationship with his daughter Chloe were the unnecessary reading points. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  <br />***	2004-08-13

SEP has started to be slightly obsessed with weak female characters which surprises me a lot. I am used to read her stories about strong yet tender and somehow independent females. If you read \\"Dream a little dream or Nobody's baby but mine, you will understand what I am trying to say. Unfortunately I was not moved by Molly Sommerville. I, too am having trouble understanding what had happened the brilliant Kevin from Nobody's baby but mine. That one was definetly gorgeous and humorous. In this book he is still amazing but lack of that kind of spirit, perhaps because of immature Molly.  <br />Just in Heaven, Texas before, this time I, again find most interesting, the romance between the celebrities; Kevin's mother and famous artist. <br />This one is not a real disappointment but, consider your time and preferences as well as money before ordering it.  <br />	2004-08-13

I am an avid reader of Orhan Pamuk, however I must say that this one is his masterpiece. My name is Red is taking us to historical labyrinths of Istanbul. His trademark \\"detailed description of the characters and events\\" is at its best. What I like most is Pamuk usually tells his stories from different points of view. This books looks like a murder-suspense book at the first place, however page by page you start to see Islam and its philosopy from the eyes of 16th century miniaturists. What I learnt from his interviews is Pamuk could not finish writing this book for a long time and he always prefers handwriting (just like his friend, great Paul Auster). You can see his precise technique and talented storytelling page by page. Pamuk has obviously done a great research about the 16th century Istanbul and the result is awesome. I may critize the translation a little bit but I appreciate that to translate a book by O.Pamuk must be tough! My name is red is \\"a must\\" Because of this book Pamuk got the 2003 IMPAC award.

The relationship between Gracie and Bobby Tom is rather superficial and the nature of the main characters are slightly more than ridiculous. Bobby Tom and his life style is definetly kitsch! Although SEP had tried hard to make the readers believe his talents and intelligence, the result is somehow disappointment. On the other hand, personally, I liked to read the dialogs between Way Sawyer(the rich and the bad guy of the town) and Suzy (Bobby Tom's mother), their sizzling relationship was much more interesting.

I believe that she could not show her talent in this book. The plot was so predictable. The alcoholism issue had made the male character believeable but many repeats on this matter were humiliating. If you are a real fan of hers, buy it, if not skip this one.	2004-08-13
US	52333695	R1UMRYC3I5H9TQ	0140244611	601825249	Istanbul: The Imperial City	Books	5	39	41	N	N	An ultra-great history read	I guess, the best saying about Istanbul is from Petrus Gyllius, -a French humanist and diplomat-  who had been to Istanbul during the age of Suleyman the Magnificent. Gyllius called the Bosphorus \\"the strait that surpasses all straits, because with one key it opens and closes two worlds, two seas\\".<br /><br />This book starts with this comment and goes on emphasising the true beauty of the city.<br /><br />John Freely is a magnificant author and obviously in love with Istanbul. Actually he is a physic professor. You can follow his precise style in all of his books. The very fascinating film \\"Notting Hill\\" from Julia Roberst and Hugh Grant made this book popular all around the world. The travelbooks-shop owner Hugh Grant recommends this book to Julia Roberts just in the beginning of the film and emphasizes its high quality.<br /><br />It goes without saying that Istanbul is a well written and well illustrated book. If you have been to Istanbul before, it will remarkably reinforce your memories. If you are a real fan of history and architecture and adore intellectually written books, dont skip this one. Really breathtaking! It will take you to a whimsical yet magnificent city and its history; particulary Byzantine era. The detailed information about Istanbul's monuments, Theodosian walls (built by Theodosius II in the first half of fifth century, AD, which are still magnificent even in their ruins, the long line of towers and battlements one of the enduring symbols of Byzantium), churches, obelisks, mosques, geography and historical events which were successfully chronicled will definetly help you to understand both its glory and history. Whilst reading this book, you will see the talisman and smell judas trees, terebinths,cypress, plane trees and umbrella pines. The part of history is excellent. You will learn that once upon a time the city had been only a hamlet and had remained a free city up until the last years of the second century. In addition to that, Freely reminds us of its entire given name that is NOVA ROMA CONSTANTINOPOLITANA; New Rome, the city of Constantine. Within the centuries, the name had got shortened and had become today's version. Amazing, isn't it?<br /><br />I must say that if you are interested in these type of books, it worths it, if not you may get a little bit bored. So consider your preferences and then order this one.<br /><br />Also recommended; anything by John Freely, Atat&uuml;rk by Andrew Mango and if you like literature and fiction My Name is Red by Orhan Pamuk.its entire given name that is NOVA ROMA CONSTANTINOPOLITANA; New Rome, the city of Constantine.

I have to admit that I am totally puzzled by the high ratings this book has received. Unfortunately the main story line and romance was totally lack of attraction and humour. After years of living their separate lives, Rafe and Hannah return to Eclipse Bay: it is a well-known start. Jayne Ann Krentz is very talented but still using the old fame of hers and repeating herself, perhaps she takes it for granted.	2004-08-13
