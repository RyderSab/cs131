In fact, Abbey's recommendation for traffic control has been implemented in Zion to excellent effect.<br /><br />The book on the whole is very well written and is a poetic description of the desert southwest when it was still quite wild: before Arches became accessible and before the Glen Canyon dam created Lake Powell.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the cover of my edition shows a photo of Monument Valley, which is only briefly mentioned, instead of Arches, which is the whole book.	2005-08-20

This turns out to be an important distinction, one that makes the volcano that created the park one of the largest ever in the history of the planet.<br /><br />This book is well written and makes the geology accesible and interesting. And at the end, is a stop-by-stop tour of the two parks that will take you face-to-face with all that you have learned.	2005-07-30

Pete Peterson ran Lehman in the distant past, was a Secretary of Commerce and now runs the Blackstone Group. His views on politics and economics would seem to be be thoughtful and insightful, so it was with this perspective that I bought his latest book Running On Empty for a long plane ride from Bozeman to Boston.<br /><br />By and large, his analysis of the current state of affairs is the pretty standard stuff of conservative economics, a bit strident but unexceptional. It was not for this, however, that I bought the book since I was expecting to agree with most of his premises, but for his policy prescriptions ... describing the problem is not the hard part, providing workable solutions is the heavy lifting.<br /><br />And so it was with a good deal of surprise that I read and then re-read his analysis of \\"the savings problem\\".<br /><br />\\"Everyone\\" knows that much of America's problem lies in its dismal savings rate, and Peterson is loud in his denunciations. Since corporations are actually \\"saving\\" more than usual (i.e.., they are deferring investment and not returning retained earnings to their shareholders), if the American savings rate is too low it must be the fault of the spendthrift public consumer whose rate of consumption has been rising faster than increases in income for several years, leading -everyone knows- to ultimate calamity. Or so goes the standard logic.<br /><br />The trouble is that this doesn't do the slightest justice to the rationality and commonsense of the American consumer.<br /><br />Let's review the history: despite warnings about \\"irrational exuberance\\" starting in 1996, the Fed (an arm of the government) pursued a policy of relatively easy money, one example of which was the failure to raise margin rates in an effort to cool off stock market speculation. Interest rates, both short and long, rose during the period of the run-up to the stock market crash in 2001, however the Fed initially hesitated to raise short rates and the Treasury Department (another arm of the government) bought back 30-year bonds, both of which actions tended to hold rates down; in any event, the short-term rate of return of stock market speculation far exceeded the yield on the longest bond.<br /><br />Then in 2001 the stock market bubble burst, precipitating a recession. The governmental response was appropriately Keynesian: loose fiscal and monetary policies are called for when an economy is facing a downturn and the prescription seemed to work quite well ... tax cuts, deficit spending and rate cuts kept the recession from being deep and painful. Hooray!<br /><br />However, we can now look back on this series of events and see that the likelihood is that the government has over responded because money is now as loose now as it has been for at least two generations, which is fueling yet another speculative bubble, this time in real estate.<br /><br />What does all this have to do with the savings rate?<br /><br />Let's think for a moment about the doughty American yeoman consumer. This worthy has recently been burned in the stock market and despite Jim Cramer's most strenuous efforts is reluctant to be burned there again; but what's the alternative? To invest in bonds at a negative real rate of return and see the investment actually decline versus its buying power? That's not a very appealing prospect.<br /><br />The flip side of negative real rates of return, however, is free money to borrow. I ask you: what rational person would invest at a loss rather than borrow with the prospect of paying back less, after inflation, than they borrowed? Particularly with the financial services industry ginning up clever \\"products\\" such as adjustable, interest-only mortgages with early payments that do not cover even the interest? And we thought that allowing margin rates to stand was dangerous!<br /><br />So this brings us back to Peterson's policy prescriptions, primary among which is to enact legislation requiring American citizens to invest a certain portion of their incomes. I think Peterson has been living among the lotus eaters and become a communist.<br /><br />The government pursues a loose monetary policy by lowering interest rates and a loose fiscal policy through deficit spending<br /><br />Conservative economists and liberal politicians both decry the profligacy of the government<br /><br />Everyone worries about the low savings rate that was explicitly created by this government policy<br /><br />... and the solution is to force the American consumer to bail us out by legislating economically irrational behavior?<br /><br />I started out in Bozeman in a pretty good humor but by the time I landed at Logan I was pretty worked up. Surely the best policy minds can come up with something better than this?uiring American citizens to invest a certain portion of their incomes.

But the main theme of the book is how bad the local outfitters are, catering to largely ignorant and uncaring hunting clients, they break the law with impunity and generally behave badly.<br /><br />The most remote spot in the lower 48 is actually quite heavily travelled and usually travelled by unattractive characters.<br /><br />The scene painted is undoubtedly true, but truth comes in many flavors and the focus on the bad makes this book a bit grim.	2005-07-02

And writing these objectives down is helpful for keeping them in your mind during the hectic routine of everyday.<br /><br />So far, so good. It's good advice and we all should take it.<br /><br />However, the book seems to imply that people's lists should consist entirely of adventure travel. There ought to be more to one's life than that.<br /><br />The author suggests Eight Great Themes for your list making; in fact, he calls them THE Eight Great Themes. They are:<br /><br />Face your fear<br /><br />Get lost<br /><br />Test you limits<br /><br />Take a leap of faith<br /><br />Rediscover your childhood<br /><br />Shed your inhibitions/Express yourself<br /><br />Break new ground<br /><br />Aim for the heart<br /><br />Perhaps there are more Great Themes than just these?

It is masterful, it is erudite and it is eminently readable ... all 660 pages of it.<br /><br />Geology, and its sister Paleontology, are simultaneously fascinating and boring. McPhee has taken out the boring part. He tells the story of the history of the earth by travelling US I-80 (the East-West interstate highway that runs from New York to San Francisco) in the company of several eminent geologists. The stories that can be found in the cuts that were made by the builders of this road add up to the history of both a continent and a science. The stories of the lives of the geologists are no less fascinating.<br /><br />It is not every casual reader who is willing to pick up a huge tome like this one and slog through several hundreds of pages in which it is assumed that you either know or will quickly learn when the Cambrian Period was, that it was part of the Paleozoic Era, and what its broad historical and evolutionary significance was.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you take the \\"quickly learn\\" route.

Really. What America has wrought serves as a shining example to all peoples for all time.<br /><br />But when the Chinese, for example, chide us for our criticism of their treatment of the peoples of Tibet and Xinjiang by saying that we ought to get off our high horse, thay make a painful point.<br /><br />Somehow, just after America finished spilling the blood of a million of its own people to preserve the Union and free the Negro slaves, the same people (Sherman, Sheridan, Custer, et al were heroes of the Civil War) took it upon themselves, as the instrument of a whole nation, to exterminate the Indians.<br /><br />Why would a country emancipate and enfranchise its Negro slaves at such a staggering cost and almost simultaneously deny freedom, franchise and life itself to the Indians?<br /><br />This book makes it pretty plain that the vast majority of the Plains Indians were no threat to anyone. For the most part they were pitiful and starving, and completley overwhelmed by the advance of our forebears. Most of the attacks by the US Army on Indian encampments caught the occupants completely by surprise and resulted in the deaths primarily of women and children.<br /><br />But we already knew this, didn't we? What this book lays out is just how outmatched the Indians were and just how predatory the White Man was. No punches are pulled, but this is no polemic.<br /><br />So what was the difference, in the late 1800s, between the Negro and the Indian? Why were they treated so completely differently? The only conclusion can be that the Negro didn't own anything of value at the time, whereas the Indian had the great misfortune to be living on land that a much stronger people wanted to occupy.<br /><br />America can still serve as a beacon of freedom and rectitude to the world. But we did not come by this without some shameful behavior.	2005-06-12

The county seat has since moved a few miles north to Doylestown but Newtown retains all the narrow-street and varied-architectural charm of America from the colonies of small farms to modest Victorian grandeur.<br />Pennsylvania is made up of boroughs and townships. The boroughs were small, intended as the villages, and the townships were large, containing the farms. In 1978 Newtown Borough and Newtown Township each had about 2,000 residents. Since then Newtown Borough has remained about the same while the farms in Newtown Township have been replaced by town homes, and the population has increased nearly ten-fold. Only one farm remains at this writing.<br />This book is a nostalgic look back (and includes pictures of my house) but the Borough still looks very much as it did a century ago ... better, actually: no horses, no trolley, paved streets &amp; sidewalks and gentrification have made it even more attractive and livable.	2004-07-04

I believe 'ol Leo painted on a somewhat bigger canvas but \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is a very enjoyable Western, not a dud at all.<br />No in media res foolishness for McMurtry, the technique here is to fire up a half-dozen parallel story lines and move from one to another every few pages to keep the reader from losing interest in any one of them (102 chapters). With all of them ending up in Ogallala Nebraska with everybody conveniently widowed at precisely the right moment to seem to ensure a happy ending; but the apogee is still to come at that point and enough loose ends are left to provide for a sequel.<br />A sequel!?? At 945 paperback pages it's a lot of reading and you have to get through most of it before you're ready to agree that the Pulitzer folks were right in their judgment. But if you have the stamina the story will carry you happily from Lonesome Dove (a flyspeck town in south Texas) on a cattle drive to Montana, with numerous stops, characters and adventures along the way. The Pulitzer was deserved.<br />Heroic men on horseback, evil drunken murderers fit only for the hanging they eventually get, beautiful compassionate women, Indians good bad and pitiful, whores, card sharps, innocent young cowpokes, the US Cavalry, grizzly bears, bad whiskey, big skies, dangerous rivers; you've got 'em all: Festus, Doc, Kitty, Matt, Roy, Dale, Trigger, Tonto, John Wayne, Gary Cooper and Ronald Reagan. Maybe a little Mel Brooks, too; a bit before Butch Cassidy's time.<br />The story centers around two Texas Rangers who are past their prime Rangering years. Part of the appeal for any similarly-aged readers is the fact that these men have had their share both of triumphs and life-altering failures with which they have to live the rest of their lives. There are many vignettes throughout that have a very strong odor of \\"Lord Jim\\", a haunting feeling I think we all begin to wrestle with when we are no longer children. The characters are very well developed and they become your friends (even the bad ones) as you lope along on horseback in the Old American West.<br />The reviewer who complains of political correctness is right.

Nonetheless, it's not supposed to be historically accurate: it's supposed to be a great love story set on the frontier, which it is; and a good one.

Following his retirement, Zinni was asked by Colin Powell and his Deputy, Richard Armitage, to be the Special Advisor to the Secretary of State for the Middle East.<br />Zinni has subsequently been a strident critic of the Iraq invasion and the Bush administration, particularly the neo-cons in and out of the Pentagon; he has been mentioned as a possible running mate for John Kerry. This book is Zinni's life story, ghost written by a third party and marketed by Tom Clancy. But that's about all it is: what it is not is either an insightful history or a thoughtful policy commentary.<br />Zinni's military career began in Vietnam in 1961 and spanned a period of exceptional changes as America emerged from the slump of the 60s and 70s to take over the mantle of World Leader after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The US military has been faced with unprecedented requirements to adapt, and Zinni was in the middle of it for 40 years. His story is disappointingly one-dimensional, though, more a discussion of his career than an analysis of the issues.<br />Critical of the Peace Dividend and the failure to see that difficulties would arise from the ashes of the Cold War, Zinni's analysis is that East-West tensions were replaced by North-South tensions and that states have been replaced as the key players by non-states such as al Qaeda, NGOs and multi-national corporations, enabled by the &quot;global information revolution&quot; and cheap transportation for poor people wishing to emigrate, primarily Muslims to Europe. Zinni laments the absence of a post-Cold War Marshall Plan to deal with the rising tensions. Whether his or anyone's vision was actually so clear in 1989 is open to question.<br />Zinni's largest missions were the massive and successful relief effort in Iraqi Kurdistan after the first Gulf war and the support of the international relief mission in Somalia (Black Hawk Down). According to Zinni, the problem in Somalia was the UN, focused not on relief as much as on the political mission to establish democracy, excluding the warlords from the process. Zinni is actually quite sympathetic to Mohamed Farah Aideed whom he says was working with the US before the turnover of command to the UN and Zinni's departure.<br />A supporter of Clinton's instinct for engagement and critical of isolationist tendencies in the Congress that kept resources tight, Zinni identifies 1998 as the year terrorism became an institutional threat. Al Qaeda created a network to link previously disorganized groups to provide training, planning and funding, announcing its arrival that year with the East African embassy bombings (the WTC bombing five years prior is not mentioned). Also that year Zinni met Ahmed Chalabi, supported among others by John McCain, proposing to topple Saddam Hussein with US help; Zinni expressed his disdain, referring to a &quot;Bay of Goats&quot; with &quot;Gucci Guerillas&quot;.  As Zinni was transferring command to Tommy Franks in 2000, the USS Cole was bombed in Aden and Zinni took the hit before Congress and in the press.<br />Immediately following 9/11 Colin Powell asked Zinni to take the point on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, another in a long line of well-meaning but utterly doomed such attempts to make peace.<br />The book is easy reading but there's not a lot of meat unless you're really interested in Tony Zinni's career, per se.of the international relief mission in Somalia (Black Hawk Down).

This book is the text for TheCapitol.Net's excellent three-day course on the workings of Congress and the two compliment each other.<br />The House and Senate are very different from each other in procedure and focus and this book carefully and effectively explains how. Plus, the function of Congressional staff is little understood but highly important, the budget and appropriations process is an important mystery. How does a Congressman go from first election to functioning member? What are the offices and roles of party leadership? Who are lobbyists and how do they work? How do you research legislation, made and in the making?<br />It's all here. This book is essential reading for anyone with an interest in these subjects but who hasn't worked on the Hill.	2004-06-20

Consider this quote ': &quot;? no legal fee can be too high for a large corporation with billions at stake on a phrase in the law ?&quot; Meet Joe Califano: simultaneously General Counsel to the Democratic National Convention and Outside Counsel to the Washington Post during Watergate; and the reason you can't smoke in public.<br />Joe Califano's career as a Washington insider began as a member of the Kennedy administration and continues to this day as that most celebrated but shadowy of creatures, the Washington insider. His book is a very personal account, easily read, of a man who has exercised power and enjoyed himself doing it. His is a quintessentially American not-quite-rags to riches story, the result of hard work and dedication. A heroic figure to many (and quite pleased with himself), Joe Califano is also a card carrying member of the society of arch devils who comprised Liberal America in its pre-Reagan heyday.<br />Raised by a devout family, in a devout milieu, Califano attributes much of his social consciousness to his strict Catholic upbringing; Catholicism takes up a good part of the beginning of the book and a very large part of all of Califano's life; repeatedly woven into the story are the strength his faith gave him and the wrenching conflicts it forced him to face.<br />Switching from the reflexively anti-communistic Republicanism of his family, and while working for Republican Tom Dewey's law firm, Joe's policy instincts were first evident in his early support for Jack Kennedy. Supporting JFK in debates at New York City's Reform Democratic Clubs, he recalls &quot;In all my debates, I was never able to capture a single vote for Kennedy&quot;. Which led directly to his becoming one of McNamara's &quot;whiz kids&quot; in the new administration, the springboard for all that followed.<br />He describes a level of intensity and excitement in his first days, in the depths of the Cold War, akin to what was ascribed to the early members of the New Deal administration: idealism, energy, commitment and controversy. A sample of the issues he faced:<br />- Reforming the military administration at the Pentagon<br />- Army protection of civil rights and enforcement of desegregation as Army Chief Cyrus Vance's special assistant<br />- Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis, Fidel Assassination plots<br />- Kennedy burial duties<br />- Lawyer before an international tribunal on riots in Panama Canal Zone<br />At first reluctant to work for Lyndon Johnson after Kennedy's assassination, he came to admire the man's programs and the man himself; because of his intelligence, because of his abilities as a politician, and because Califano passionately believed in The Great Society programs which he was eventually to run as Johnson's domestic policy advisor. If a mentor is someone whose influence is evident throughout later life, Johnson was Califano's mentor. Califano's role working with Johnson was central to the making of who Califano later became; all else was prologue or epilogue.<br />Hate it or love it, Califano was the at the center of the greatest domestic legislative storm of our generation. He loved it: &quot;? to me the public legacy of those years was nothing short of a revolution that saved the Nation ?&quot;<br />Following the 1968 Democratic Convention fiasco (the Chicago 7, Abbey Hoffman, et al) and Nixon's election, all the strains imposed by Lyndon Johnson's divisive social activism and the unpopular war in Vietnam threatened to rip the Democratic Party apart despite its continuing dominance of Congress.<br />The 1972 Democratic Presidential nominating convention was a huge fight with McGovern's anti-war politics vs. Richard Daley's machine politics. These days, the convention is just a party but then it actually chose the candidate and a terrible battle ensued. Just as the Democratic Party seemed to be slipping into its grave, Califano filed a little-noticed lawsuit resulting from a little-noticed break-in at the DNC headquarters which would ultimately result in stoking the fires further but which probably saved the party from destruction, giving it a role as loyally opposed to governmental abuse.<br />When Jimmy Carter became president, he named Califano to head the sprawling Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) where many of LBJ's Great Society programs were located. It had gotten a well-deserved reputation for waste and incompetence and Califano saw it as an opportunity to strike another blow for &quot;his&quot; programs. Califano is openly contemptuous of Carter's na?vet? and felt that success was impossible as a result. Obsessed with detail and not open to compromise, Carter contrasted very unfavorably with LBJ's great skill as a domestic politician.<br />Some of the issues facing HEW Secretary Califano:<br />- Handicapped access<br />- Title IX collegiate women's sports<br />- Federally-funded abortions<br />- Sterilization<br />- Recombinant DNA<br />- Fetal Research<br />- Hospice<br />Califano's greatest contribution and his ultimate demise was his anti-smoking campaign. Commonplace today, no-smoking areas were both unusual and highly controversial then.<br />Califano's differences with Carter and his inner circle led to Califano's resignation in 1979. Carter was looking forward to the 1980 election and he desperately needed the tobacco interests in the South which Califano had alienated.<br /><br />Califano has been out of the limelight for decades and he describes his displeasure with this state of affairs. He's been making money, doing and repaying favors, getting remarried to a rich socialite; all of which he describes with a style that makes you feel you know him. His restlessness led him finally to retire from the practice of law and devote all of his energies to founding and running the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. He describes his various encounters with the evils of addition, and he has decided to devote his considerable energy and resources to fighting it.<br />Apparently, the Secretary of Health, etc. neglected ever to get a colonoscopy and in 1993 he had bloody stool and now he has a considerably less lengthy colon. Almost immediately thereafter, he also discovered rather advanced prostate cancer. Ten years later, he seems still to be going strong and whatever difficulties he now faces because of his physical problems, they have not impaired his ability to write an interesting book about his exceptional life.ttle-noticed break-in at the DNC headquarters which would ultimately result in stoking the fires further but which probably saved the party from destruction, giving it a role as loyally opposed to governmental abuse.<br />When Jimmy Carter became president, he named Califano to head the sprawling Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) where many of LBJ's Great Society programs were located.

US	52585226	R4J9X7U3C036U	1400041996	315702599	The Iraq War	Books	4	29	36	N	Y	Historical Perspective and Military Details	John Keegan is the Defense Editor of The Daily Telegraph of London; he writes knowledgably and fluently about the second Gulf War and its antecedents.<br />The first half of the book is the history of Iraq from the time of Mesopotamia, with an emphasis on the origins of Saddam Hussein and his Ba'ath party. There is a secular history of the modern Middle East, parallel to and different from the history of the rise of Islamic terrorism. In Iraq specifically, the secular history is more important to understanding the country's development and the people whom it is hoped will be able to create a stable and peaceful nation out of the rubble and turmoil that presently exists.<br />Keegan gives an interesting, offshore critique of the neo-con policies in this historical context, such as pre-emption, the belief in the salutary effect of implanting democracy, particularity (i.e., &quot;A city that is set on an hill ...&quot;) and Zionism. He also provides a very interesting analysis of European attitudes toward the war. Eastern Europe supported US policy because they saw Stalinism in Saddam, which they knew and hated. Western Europe by and large protested, the root of their disagreement being what Keegan calls &quot;Olympianism&quot;:  the strong belief that supra-national institutions can provide the solution to conflicts between states, the EU locally and the UN globally. Keegan describes this as the belief that &quot;laws will be obeyed by their mere promulgation&quot;.<br />Keegan gives a stirring description of Tony Blair's speech before The Commons in March 2003 that turned back a vote of no-confidence despite the defection of many in his own party and paved the way for Britain's active participation.<br />The second half of the book is a somewhat detailed description of the assaults by the US forces up the river valleys and into Baghdad, and the British forces investing and taking Basra. The difference in approach between the first and second Gulf Wars is analyzed.<br />Of more importance than the military maneuvers is the issue of the behavior of the Iraqi army and populace, which Keegan describes as &quot;mysterious&quot; and which he feels has an important bearing on the difficult security situation after the end of formal hostilities. The mystery is that the armies didn't really fight, they mostly deserted and vanished back into their homes; and the general population often behaved as though they were on a movie set, going about their daily business and ignoring the battles.<br />The decision to disband the military and the police and to exclude Ba'ath members is criticized and is held partly responsible for the effective morphing of the foreigners and fedayeen from irregular soldiers to looters to urban guerillas, recruiting numerous demobilized and unemployed soldiers. The British are credited with more experience in such situations based on their years of colonial rule, which led them to the more practical approach of establishing law and order rather than worrying about the ideological objective of immediately establishing democratic institutions.<br /><br />The book is interesting and worth reading. It fails, however, to pursue the &quot;mystery&quot; which it introduces at the beginning; the book ends with very little thought given to its causes or its solution.br />Of more importance than the military maneuvers is the issue of the behavior of the Iraqi army and populace, which Keegan describes as &quot;mysterious&quot; and which he feels has an important bearing on the difficult security situation after the end of formal hostilities.

All the billions spent on homeland security will never be sufficient to prevent a determined suicide bomber; just ask any Israeli.<br />To a Muslim, Arabia is the birthplace of the Prophet and Baghdad is the seat of the Caliphate (a Caliph being the successor of Mohammed).  Americans see the first Gulf War as an effort to stop the invasion of an ally by a murderous thug, a la Czechoslovakia by Hitler; Muslims the world over are being taught to see it as a desecration of two of Islam's holiest places. How's that for a chasm of mutual misunderstanding?<br />Eminently readable, this short book by America's pre-eminent Mid East scholar examines these concepts and problems from an erudite historical perspective that helps to begin to lift the shades from Western, secular eyes regarding a seemingly-impenetrable culture.  No Margaret Mead, he, Lewis is addressing one of the central issues of our time ? the Light Of Civilization during our Dark Ages, Islam is now being crushed between a burgeoning East and a dominant West; its reactions are affecting and possibly threatening all of our lives.	2004-06-11

This book takes us up to Robert Mueller's confirmation and the immediate aftermath of the WTC attacks, and is an important addition to our knowledge of our premier law-enforcement agency as it struggles to adapt to post-Cold War realities.<br />The story of the FBI is the story of its Directors:<br />* 1908 - 1923 Formation<br />Started by TR's AG who was tired of having to call on the Secret Service for investigative support, agents were originally neither allowed to carry weapons nor to make arrests.<br />* 1924 - 1972 J. Edgar Hoover<br />For 48 years Hoover was &quot;The Director&quot;. Hoover was responsible for creating the idea of the FBI that we all know and that attracted America's best to its agent force. It was a great institution Hoover created, but he himself was guilty of much unseemly behavior including political blackmail.<br />* 1972 - 1973 L. Patrick Grey<br />Named acting Director by Richard Nixon after Hoover's death, Grey represented the lowest ebb of FBI management, giving secret Watergate information to White House Counsel John Dean and destroying evidence. The great beating heart of the agent force was most evident during this sorry period, however: they continued faithfully the investigations that ultimately were the downfall of their boss, Grey, his boss, Attorney General Mitchell, as well as President Nixon himself.<br />* 1973 - 1978 Clarence Kelley<br />An ex-agent himself, Kelley began the process of bringing the FBI's behavior at all levels back into line with its reputation. But he was politically insensitive during an exceptionally turbulent period, and stayed fewer than 5 years.<br />* 1978 - 1987 William Webster<br />Appointed by President Carter, Webster oversaw a period of great renewal. Largely as a result of his excellent results at the FBI, President Reagan appointed Webster to run the CIA, which was the FBI's great loss.<br />* 1987 - 1993 William Sessions<br />Sessions was fired by President Clinton after a DOJ report detailed numerous instances of corruption and poor judgment. Sessions initially refused to leave and afterwards carried on an attempt to blame jealousy inside the FBI for his problems, the last of which was the Branch Davidian disaster in Waco, Texas.<br />* 1993 - 2001 Louis Freeh<br />A former agent and a US Attorney under Rudy Giuliani, Louis Freeh was an agent's agent. But it soon became clear he was not competent to manage a large organization. He hated technology: removing the computer from his office, he didn't use email and refused to allow agents access to the Internet. Freeh gave us &quot;Filegate&quot;, mishandled the Ruby Ridge, Waco and Wen Ho Lee investigations, and leaked an internal memo supporting an independent counsel, thereby alienating Republicans and Democrats alike.<br />* 2001 -  Robert Mueller<br />Confirmed less than a month before 9/11, Mueller took over when the FBI faced its greatest crisis ever. Early press clippings have been favorable but he has already presided over a $1 billion technology-upgrade failure. The FBI desperately needs leadership and Kessler is a fan; America can only hope.<br />The sub title of this book &quot;The Secret History ...&quot; is overly melodramatic.

Against All Enemies manages to confirm the prejudices of both his supporters and his detractors.<br /><br />The book has two personalities.<br />The good book begins with a fascinating insider's look at the White House on September 11, 2001. It then proceeds to educate us about the recent history of US involvement in the Middle East and the rise of terrorism as the replacement for the Soviet Union as the main threat to the security of the United States. The book is well worth reading just for this, to say nothing of the fact that its notoriety has made it required reading anyway. The story is immensely important, and Clarke tells it very well.<br />The bad book is all about Richard Clarke, a man whose talents and contributions have obviously never been suitably appreciated. For instance, we are informed that as the youngest Assistant Secretary of State he single-handedly was responsible for Israel's agreement to abide by the UN sanctions on arms sales to South Africa during apartheid. It turns out that every event in the Middle East for the last 30 years has Clarke's stamp on it ... his doing if it worked out, someone else's fault if it didn't.<br />What about the substance of his charges? First, the headline is different from the story.<br />The headline is &quot;Three Republican Presidents irresponsibly ignored terrorism; one Democrat tried his best but was crippled by partisan attacks by Republican adversaries.&quot; This is nearly verbatim from the preface and is a fair representation of his public remarks before the 9-11 Commission and on TV.<br />The story itself is actually more balanced. He credits Reagan's response to Afghanistan as paving the way to subsequent support for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait against Iraq and he is quite complimentary of Bush 41's coalition building and the decision not to occupy Iraq afterwards. He argues that another 72 hours of warfare would have been appropriate in the first Iraq war and he contrasts Bush 43's Iraq preparations unfavorably with those of Bush 41.<br />Not until the last chapter does Clarke's book resemble Clarke's public statements. Here, he loses the appearance of thoughtful objectivity and lapses into partisan polemic. It may be the case that some, much or even all of what he says here is correct, but he turns off any reader who is looking for the truth rather than for material to use in a political attack. Many of his policy proposals are persuasive, but like the space-shuttle engineers who knew the O rings would fail, it is not enough to be right.<br />Richard Clarke has testified under oath that the Bush 43 administration irresponsibly disregarded the threat of terrorism. Condi Rice has testified under oath to the contrary. At the moment, the country is riven along these lines and is about to express its views in a Presidential election. It will take years for an informed consensus to develop both about the facts and about their meaning. Everyone is very likely to look back on these events as the most momentous in 30 or 40 years; in the mean time everyone, both red and blue, should read this book: despite its significant weaknesses it is informed and thought-provoking.He argues that another 72 hours of warfare would have been appropriate in the first Iraq war and he contrasts Bush 43's Iraq preparations unfavorably with those of Bush 41. <br />Not until the last chapter does Clarke's book resemble Clarke's public statements.

But it is a true story, one that will rivet your attention and leave your head spinning.<br />The basic story, that the large agri-business Archer Daniels Midland - ADM - was caught in an international price-fixing scam for food additives would merit coverage in Business Week but little else. The key to the story is the informant himself, Mark Whitacre, the President of one of ADM's largest and most successful divisions. Manipulative, deceitful, delusional, sociopathic ... these are accurate but inadequate descriptions of the man who sucked ADM, the FBI and the DOJ into a five-year whirlwind, played out on the headlines of every newspaper in the country; he will suck you in, too.<br />Who hasn't wondered what kind of knucklehead responds to those crazy scam letters and emails from Nigeria? Actually, so many Americans with access to large amounts of cash responded in the 1980s and 1990s that the FBI had to set up a special liaison office in Lagos to deal with them. Meet Mark Whitacre: brilliant biochemist, builder and President of a hugely successful division of a multi-national corporation; and hopelessly entangled by his crazy belief that he could hit the jackpot by aiding corrupt Nigerian officials. And more, much, much more.<br />The story will sweep you along, from one unbelievable plot twist to another, not reaching a crescendo until the very end. Great fun. But also a great testament to the American justice system. Battered on all sides by the media and politicians and wealthy corporate defendants and with an utterly unreliable witness, the FBI and the DOJ persevere and see their case through to what seems like a very satisfactory conclusion, all the compromises and plea bargains notwithstanding.<br />Eichenwald deserves great credit: not only for his real-time coverage of the story in the New York Times and the writing of this brilliant book, but also for the fact that he nearly simultaneously was covering the astonishing demise of Bache Halsey Stuart Shields in the Serpent On The Rock, another amazingly readable true story of human frailty.ok, but also for the fact that he nearly simultaneously was covering the astonishing demise of Bache Halsey Stuart Shields in the Serpent On The Rock, another amazingly readable true story of human frailty.	2004-05-28

US	52585226	RWARJXWT60A1D	074325547X	828250107	Plan of Attack	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Important subject, turgid prose	Rarely has an important book of this sort been written and published with such remarkable timing. Richard Clarke had similar timing but his tone was strident and potentially politically or at least commercially motivated. Woodward apparently had the inside track but manages to appear to maintain objectivity. A very important distinction.<br />Plan of Attack was written at a time when the war in Iraq, while ugly, appeared to be improving; and it was published (and its epilogue written) when the war had confirmed its ugliness and seemed to be deteriorating; all the while being one of the central issues of a close and fiercely contested Presidential election. This book is an important document written at an important time and one that forces reflection on one of the most important current events of our time.<br />However, the final verdict on this book will have to wait for events to sort themselves out considerably more than is the case at present. It is possible that events in Iraq have begun an irreversible downward spiral; it is also possible that the situation can be reversed and the strategic benefits of stability and peace can be achieved with the concomitant benefit to the Middle East and the security of the United States. Certainly the latter is to be hoped for; this book leans somewhat more to the former perspective, but it obviously is too soon to know.<br />The book moves through three stages:<br />* The first is the war planning; primarily the interchange between Tommy Franks and Donald Rumsfeld<br />* The second encompasses a much wider cast as the debate about pre-emption and the value of UN involvement raged around the President<br />* Finally is the story of the war's beginning, including an epilogue written after David Kay's resignation after not finding WMD<br />All of these stages are a recitation of current events known to anyone who reads the newspapers. But it is useful to have the events recounted and the addition of the color of the interplay of the personalities is interesting and helpful to understanding.<br />I am sorry to note that the book is written in a style that seems to be merely an edited version of a diary. It plods from day to day in a way that sometimes loses the reader's interest and often makes it difficult to maintain the broader context of what was happening at the time of the events that are related. Furthermore, the use of gratuitous profanity detracts from the narrative, however true to life it may be. While demerits, however, these are not fatal ... this book should be near the top of everyone's list (in 2004, anyway).e personalities is interesting and helpful to understanding.<br />I am sorry to note that the book is written in a style that seems to be merely an edited version of a diary.

US	52585226	R1DSZHJ86NYNA8	0743255453	937109510	The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	4	9	10	N	Y	Well written and important but disturbing	Paul O'Neill has had a remarkable, exemplary career. From humble beginnings, the modern equivalent of a log cabin, O'Neill rose to help create the OMB under several administrations; from there he went on to become one of the finest corporate CEOs in America, which he gave up to become George W. Bush's first Treasury Secretary. We should all of us hope for a career with half this level of success ... so what such a man has to say is important and interesting.<br />Perhaps it's to harsh to put it quite this way, but it seems that a large part of this book is the story of O'Neill conspiring with his old friend Alan Greenspan to subvert the tax cut plan that came out of the presidential campaign. The desire on the part of the Treasury Secretary to influence economic policy is not controversial but the approach as described seems unusual to say the least: petulant, passive-aggressive behavior. Another of O'Neil's themes is that the inner circle of the administration (of which O'Neil was not a part) had already made its mind up on a number of subjects - including the tax cuts - and the subterfuge was carried out in frustration with not being heard, but it is disturbing to think that the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America would either be forced into such a position or that he would stoop to such behavior as a response.<br />In fact, reading this book produces a very broad based sense of unease. On the one hand, O'Neil describes an administration that operates entirely on a preconceived, purely politically-motivated basis, completely lacking in intellectual curiosity or integrity (the famous quote about a blind man in a room full of deaf people and the claim that Iraq and tax cuts were the administration's exclusive focus from the very beginning). On the other hand, this is the Treasury Secretary that maneuvered to propose a tax rebate to Congress without even informing his boss, to say nothing of getting his agreement; and the story of trekking through Africa in wingtips with a rock star is an odd, comic twist on TR.<br />What are we to make of this? Even though this book seems to confirm a number of the unflattering press descriptions of the administration's behavior, it undermines its own credibility. Furthermore, there's a big part of me that simply does not want to believe that the United States of America is so badly managed. Not from any partisan consideration but simply as a proud and concerned citizen.<br />The book is very well written and easy to read, plus it is an interesting description of a very important subject, namely the still-evolving story of early 21st century America in a changing and difficult world.gh Africa in wingtips with a rock star is an odd, comic twist on TR.<br />What are we to make of this?

The time of the story was the 1920s and 1930s, hard times in a very hard country, long before the arrival of any infrastructure to speak of; roughly contemporaneous with Karen Blixen of \\"Out of Africa\\" fame. David Read was mostly left to his own devices as a youngster and his best friend was a Masai boy. Together, they hunted and otherwise lived in the wilds of the East African savannah and lived together among the Masai.<br />In those days the Masai lived very much as they had done for the two hundred years or so since they arrived on the Serengeti, migrating down the Rift Valley from Ethiopia, conquering all the tribes they encountered along the way. This book is really a recounting of the traditional Masai way of life, much changed in these days when the Masai have been driven from the Serengeti to live exclusively in the Ngorongoro Crater, a lifestyle increasingly eroded by the inevitable encroachment of modernity.<br />Both the recounting and the way of life are intriguing. The Masai, for a fierce warrior people, were remarkably hospitable both to the young white boy and to all of his kin. And yet the Masai retained their warlike ways and their other habits, including sexual abandon and the single-handed killing of lions with spears by the young warriors - the Moran - all recounted faithfully by Read as seen though his young eyes. The book provides a very interesting insight into a very unusual people.	2004-03-20

It is interesting to note that English was not her native tongue but that she paints with it a beautiful portrait of Kenya between the world wars, its people and its landscapes.<br />But unlike Conrad, another non-native English speaker who wrote of his Colonial-era experiences, Blixen has neither written a book nor really told a story. She begins very well, and beautifully. And her description of the loss of her friend and then her farm are wonderfully and poingnantly done. But the middle of the book is a series of short - often less than a page - vignettes, largely unconnected, many of which are frankly nonsensical.<br />This, very unfortunately, is not a story of her life; she is the autobiographical protagonist but there is no insight into her, her life, her love or even her loss.

It is essentially two histories: the history of the First Crusade and its antecedents, and the history of Christianity immediately following the Crucifixion.<br />The first history is very meticulously done and it holds our interest throughout an exposition of potentially tedious research. Granted, the conclusions are based on the existence of secret and hitherto unknown documents that serve as their Rosetta Stone, but even the skeptical will find the tapestry the authors weave to be an interesting one.<br />The second history, which purports to show that Christ was married to Mary Magdalene and all that, is much less thorough and much more overtly speculative. Whereas the underlying documentary evidence of the Knights Templar may be a bit obscure, the Bible has been dissected in public and in detail for two millennia. Here, the authors purport no Rosetta Stone, and although the exposition is interesting, it does not have even a patina of research. One gets the feeling throughout of a conclusion being sought in the ambiguous language of the first four Gospels of the New Testament, a trick played by many before this.<br />If you are not a Biblical scholar or a scholar of pre-Medieval history but are interested in these subjects, this book will hold your interest. It is not ultimately convincing in the least but it presents the material in a very interesting and readable way. Scholars will undoubtedly quibble, but a layperson will find it interesting.<br /><br />Is it possible to summarize our story briefly? It goes something like this:<br />· 700 BC, the Israelite Tribe of Benjamin, for obscure reasons, was driven out of Palestine, and settled first in Arcadia in Greece and then moved up to the Marseilles area of France.<br />· Later on, Mary Magdalene, Jesus' pregnant wife at the time of the Crucifixion, fled, together with her father, Joseph of Aramathea, to Marseilles where she was warmly welcomed by the descendants of the Tribe of Benjamin. (Joseph of Aramathea continued onward to Glastonbury, England carrying a cup of Jesus' blood.)<br />· Mary Magdalene's brother, Lazarus, meanwhile, went on to lead the revolt and mass suicide at Masada that culminated in the Roman destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the Diaspora.<br />· Mary Magdalene's child founded the Merovingian dynasty of Frankish kings.<br />· Charles Martel and his grandson Charlemagne, heroes though they were for stemming the Saracen tide, treacherously overthrew the Merovingian dynasty. But the Merovingian line was preserved by the secret society of the Priory of Sion, which gave rise to the Knights Templar and had other shadowy doings down the centuries.<br />· There is living, today, in Paris a certain Pierre Plantard de Saint-Claire, who is a direct descendant of the Merovingian kings and, therefore, a direct lineal descendant of Jesus Christ, Son of God. And he, and his society, are working toward the eventual reinstatement of the \\"rightful\\", divinely ordained line of Merovingian kings.<br />· Me, too. Send money.<br />The premise and the conclusion of this book is the antithesis of the American ideal: the ultimate union of Church and State. It makes for interesting reading, but don't get carried away.es where she was warmly welcomed by the descendants of the Tribe of Benjamin.

The OED is actually a pretty good dictionary (unlike the awful Webster's), but it comes in two, large volumes which makes it impractical as an easy reference when reading on the couch; plus, I haven't run across any definition that I needed that was done better for the purpose of quick understanding than Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary does it.

Kilimanjaro, east along the great watercourses that rise on the mountain and empty into the Indian Ocean. Most of the trek is through the Tsavo game parks in southeastern Kenya.<br />Despite some sloppy editing, the book succeeds very well on two fronts. First in giving the reader a very palpable sense of being on foot and in danger in the equatorial African wilds, where humans are prey as often as predator. The other, unexpected area of success of this book is as an introduction to the personalities (Richard Leakey, for instance) and issues involved in East African conservationism., as well as a sympathetic description of the plight of the indigenous peoples living on the periphery of the game parks whose cultures were utterly destroyed by a well-intentioned attempt to save the wildlife.<br />Big topics, all, and all are well presented.<br />The author wrestles with the conflicts that arise from the fact of human population growth and the inchoate desire to preserve. He comes back over and over to the ironic story of the game warden who hires as hunting guides the poachers he himself captured. he hints that humanity may, haltingly, be developing a more sophisticated approach to these problems, at least intellectually among a few ... but still the Somalis poach elephant with automatic weapons, and still the Indonesian forests burn.<br />The question remains: will a satisfactory balance be struck as a result of the extremes engaged in liberal democratic debate, of the Greens rioting at WTO conferences and clear-cutters flattening the Amazon rain forest?<br />However, the book is primarily about an adventure walk through Africa; it is an easy read and the material is both gripping and topical (1997).	2004-01-22

Murder Mystery or Heretical Revelation?<br /><br />This book is a great page turner because it can be understood on at least three levels:<br />1. Murder Mystery<br />In the great tradition of Agatha Christie (suspense and erudition) and written in the style of Tom Clancy (i.e., jumping from one uncompleted scene to another as they rush toward each other), The Da Vinci Code makes great reading. Interesting, sympathetic characters are caught in a convoluted web that they fight to unravel, with the reader's full involvement.<br />2. Scholasticism<br />The iconography, particularly of Da Vinci of course, but to one extent or another all of Christendom, Judaism and their Pagan antecedents is touched on in an intriguing and interestingly informative way. Plus, who knew that &quot;sub rosa&quot; came from a kind of Roman mistletoe for secret meetings; or that &quot;gargoyle&quot; is derived from the word to &quot;gargle&quot;? A lot of study went into this work, and it is presented in a very readable way.<br />3. Historical Fact<br />Here, each must come to their own conclusions. The basic story is that in the year 32 AD, a pregnant woman (Mary Magdalene) walked from Roman Palestine to modern-day France, where she was sheltered by a colony of Jews who accepted her child as the descendant of the Messiah. Oh! And maybe Walt Disney was in on the secret later on, along with less amazing personages as the Knights Templar. And, of course, Leonardo Da Vinci. The mind reels.<br />Everybody loves a cabal. Cabals are fun. The Holy Grail is fun. Hermann Hesse is fun. Umberto Eco is fun. The Da Vinci Code is fun (and erudite), but let's just leave it at that ... except that, after all our page turning, we don't actually find the Grail! So there must be a sequel, no?<br />It will probably be worth reading, too. Have fun.	2004-01-10

Buddhism started in India but seems to have spread to every part of Asia except India; why?<br />These and other, similar questions are specifically ignored ... the introduction states that religion is the manifestation of humanity's search for the ultimate truth and the essence of religion is the answers to the questions and the approach taken, not iconography or history.<br />The analogy is made of many roads leading by different paths up a mountain to the same ultimate peak. The normal wonderings of people is like walking around the base, encountering significant differences and not understanding the similarities that arise from the fact that the questioning basis is the same. This approach will undoubtedly not appeal to fundamentalists who believe in the literal word of the Bible or Koran, but this is in many ways a secular look at religion, albeit from a Western bias.<br />There is a good deal of history for those religions that have a significant historical component to them: Islam and Christianity, for example, are ultimately based on the lives of a single man and their followers; Hinduism's historical roots, however, are not as significant (if they can even be authoritatively traced at all).<br />The book is a text and it is written from an academic perspective which makes it sometimes seem a bit pedantic.

It is a collection of his annual messages to shareholders organized according to topic: Corporate Governance, Corporate Finance and Investing, etc.<br />For those who enjoy and value Berkshire Hathaway's annual messages, this is a great recap. The annual messages, read annually are great but they reflect a moment in time. This collection helps to remedy that. It does two things: first, it collects all Buffett's thinking on important subjects over the years and, second, it gives a chronological progression of events (the development of his perspective on US Airways and Salomon Brothers, for instance) and the progression of his own thinking over time, shaped by his experiences.<br />There is sometimes an odd sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu because the excerpts are not always in strict chronological order, but this is a minor defect.<br />Having been read once, my Berkshire Hathaway annual reports sit in a pile in my attic gathering dust. This collection allowed me to savor them once more and to see how they fit together. Buffett is dry, and so this collection is dry; lengthy discussions on look-through earnings do not make for rapid page turning.

Often ignored or even flouted by &quot;interested sophistry&quot; but no longer particularly radical-sounding, per se.<br /><br />What this book needs is its sequel because 2004 is so far from 1980 as to make the observations of that prior era something of a naive anachronism, however true and fundamental they may still be. The real question is not what is true, but how to get from where we are to something better; this is called Politics and as such, it makes one's heart sink to think that we are in its grasp ... is there nothing to look forward to but more of the same? We need a new Friedman to tell us.	2003-12-20

But I have gone along with style and said things like &quot;Cubism is clearly in a progression from Impressionism and they from the great ones of the Rennaissance and beyond. You have to understand Rembrandt before you can understand Jasper Johns&quot;.<br />What a lot of nonsense.<br />It still ought to be possible to like Jackson Pollack and hold your head up, but please dispense with the balloney.<br />Art History is both difficult and subtle; but it's also right in front of your face. Why do we need Tom Wolfe to explain to us what we ought to know already? (And how does he reatain any of his friends?)<br />I don't know, but it's been true ever since The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and it's true here.<br />It won't take much of your time to read this book, but it will help to make you a better - or at least a more sensible - person.	2003-12-18

And how is it that he almost single handedly set the new America on the path to be the beacon of hope to the world (even if imperfectly)?<br />It seems quite certain that it was Washington who gave America its opportunity to be better than the rest. And he did so despite great temptation and enourmous provocations. Who was he?<br />In the history of the world, what victorious general has not forcibly taken political power and then looted the country? Napoleon, of course, was the contemporary example but the other examples are legion. And, following America's example, so many countries had revolutions for their freedom but virtually none remained true to their or any worthwhile ideals.<br />How did America do it? It seems that the answer is Washington. Uneducated, not particularly gifted, he intententionally devoted himself to the country's ideals and lived them, and set an example for the ages.<br />Certainly, he was surrounded by brilliant, exceptional people in an extraordinary time. But who can believe that either Jefferson or Hamilton, given the opportunity, would have put America on Washington's track? It seems quite fair to say that neither of them could have been expected to overcome their partisanship to give us all the gift bequeathed to us by Washington.<br />This book is an introduction; a distillation of a four-part scholarly work that none of us are likly to read. The chapters are short, making it easy to read on the run, and a number of details that even I know are omitted.<br />But Washington bears understanding and this book makes it possible to begin the process.	2003-12-18

These sorts of things distinguish good sailors from the mass of recreational sailors and I, for one, have an ambition to become the former. If you do, too, then this is a great book to read several times.<br />The Black Box theory of why some people are lucky and others aren't relates to preparedness and if only once in your life you need it, then it's worth it to you and your companions to have taken the trouble.	2003-06-18

He and Bogle have been two lone voices calling for ethical treatment of the customer, and they actually have tried to practice what their preached.

In this case, it was written before the US Trust acquisition and before he gave up the co-CEO role.

It is a bit of a primer, so it will probably not appeal to old M&A hands; however, any MBA can tell you about discounted cash flow analysis, but few CEOs have mastered the art and science of integration, which is the focus of this book.<br />The glamor is in the deal making: late nights with the lawyers and bankers. But most (most!) mergers fail to yield their expected value because the unglamorous job of integration is largely ignored during the deal and often mishandled afterwards.<br />Schweiger's theme is that integration is paramount to ultimate success and it must begin at or before valuation and due diligence, and it must be integrally woven into every step and every process.<br />The book is readable, logically organized and helpful.	2003-02-26

I make a point of re-reading it at least once a year to keep my feet on the ground and my head out of the clouds and other unfortunate places.<br />Townsend is a very sensible person who has sterling credentials as a succesful manager; we should all do half as well as he did. He believes in the power of doing simple things very well and allowing your staff to do what they know how to do.<br />\\"In Search Of Excellence\\" and \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" and all the great morass of poor, high faulutin' salve for the over-inflated but tender and insecure egos of senior managers should be immediately put into the trash ... shame on you if you ever attend another Hammer-esque seminar. You don't need seminars and the tricks don't work.<br />What works in management is what works everywhere in life, in the long run: humility, hard work, loyalty downwards, rewarding success and knowing how to define it.<br />In a sense, nobody should need a book to tell them these things, but life is complicated and the world is full of charlatans, so we all need to be reminded from time to time to take a step back and laugh at ourselves.	2002-07-11

Marquez carries us along and into his dizzying world of brilliance and half-reality until we start to feel at home in this surreal place of his imagination, just as we have begun to accept the impossible characters not only as real, but also as people we actually know well and are comfortable with. And then, on page 326, a supporting actor who had been forgotten for one hundred pages reappears to engineer an illegal arms transaction with Joseph Conrad!<br />Even with an author for whom reality and fantasy are usually indistinguishable, such a thing is almost too much. I nearly had to stop reading, I was so astonished; and who knows? Such a thing might actually be historically accurate!<br />But such are the things that bring us back to Marquez, despite the numerous and often nearly-insurmountable difficulties; this, my second reading of Love In The Time Of Cholera and probably not my last because there is more to be discovered.<br />I sat through The English Patient twice because I thought there was a depth that I had missed the first time. There wasn't: the second time through it became disappointingly trite; not so with Senor Marquez ... you did miss it the first time, in fact, you missed most of it.<br />In case you did not know (I did not until I looked it up) there actually IS a Magdalena River that runs North, somehow avoiding being swept into the Amazon, and empties into the Caribbean Ocean. That much, at least, is factual and it wends much of its way in the modern country of Columbia. Perhaps it all seems so unfamiliar simply because we really are not familiar with this part of the world, and at the early part of the last century? Perhaps, but only partly; there is a great deal of the mundane human experience that is the same all over the world that I have visited and lived in, and Marquez breaks certain rules that simply are not broken in reality, however distant in time and space. And it is at least partly that breaking that makes him so appealing but also because he illuminates certain constancies that survive the maelstrom of events in his books in a way that speaks to my condition, if no one else's.<br />\\"... among the countless suicides he could remember, this was the first with cyanide that had not been caused by the sufferings of love. Then something changed in the tone of his voice.

But she dried her hands as best she could on her apron, arranged her appearance as best she could, called on all the haughtiness she had been born with to calm her maddened heart ... and [was] grateful to her fate for the immense relief of going home ...\\"<br />Marquez knows, of course, that she would return as soon as she was called. So grant him his prizes and read his books and don't ask why it ends as it does and don't ask what cholera has to do with anything.because he illuminates certain constancies that survive the maelstrom of events in his books in a way that speaks to my condition, if no one else's.<br />\\"... among the countless suicides he could remember, this was the first with cyanide that had not been caused by the sufferings of love.

And make it successful, as opposed to Merrill's flop with Yamaichi? I think so, and this episode is omitted from this book.<br />But forgive Stone and Brewster this one error because their book is excellent. It is a simple, straightforward, easily-read history of an extraordinary man's accomplishments.<br />I've watched Sandy through the eyes of the WSJ's reporters over the many years he's been building his legacy and I can quote a few individual soundbites like the one about Nikko, but the whole panorama of Sandy's career only came into focus with this book. A great man, Sandy is, and he makes me proud to be part of the same industry; and I hope in small ways I can imitate him.<br />The authors are obviously fans of Sandy's, which may make them somewhat biased, but so am I.	2002-06-17

Had the nation not been created successfully, the desire for human rights would very likely never have been achieved (anywhere on earth)and yet the compromises required to be successful flew in the face of the clear statement of purpose in the Declaration.<br />How could Jefferson have written the Declaration of Independence? Wasn't he compromised to the point of being unfit for the job? Wasn't all the high-falutin' language purely self-serving cant? And why weren't the Southern grandchildren of the signers perfectly-well within their rights to secede, whatever  their motivation?<br />I have sweated these questions for years and Ellis does a fabulous job of addressing them in terms of the tactical need to create the country that could resolve the issues that would realize the strategic objective.<br />Oh, by the way: it's extremely well written, to boot; and the stories are very interesting. And I, like everyone else, came away with an even greater respect for the original George W.<br />HE'S the reason it worked; HE alone: Simon Bolivar and Robbespierre just didn't measure up to his standards and that's the proof that the country had to be created and compromises had to be made to ensure that it was.	2002-06-17

I am an avid fan of Marquez (there are too many books in this world to read bad ones twice) but this one is not up to my view of his standards.<br />First, I am always looking to be drawn into his world and savor the dizziness of this riveting and unusual Dali-esque place. As we sailed down the Magdalena River together, the three of us, I did not feel this.<br />Second, I came looking for hints of why Bolivar failed where Washington succeeded and I was very disappointed. Perhaps he failed because he was as squalid as this book makes him seem and it is overly romatic of me to think that there is a more textured, subtle explanation. But I look for greatness in great men, even if it is great failings; Marquez did not show it to me.<br />Luckily, my current project is &quot;The Founding Brothers&quot; by Ellis. Say what you will about falsifying a resume, the man can write and he is doing for the North American Republican Experiment what Marquez failed to do for the one in South America.<br />George Fisher	2002-06-01
