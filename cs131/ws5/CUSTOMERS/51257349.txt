The only problem I have with this book is the fact that Sita throws away lovers like paper.  I mean I would like to see one of Sita's lovers  make it past a book and a half ( Joal was actually in half of part 3  because of the fact that he sort of vanished out of action for about 90  pages or so.)  I just hope Sita's daughter can make it past the next two  books.	1999-11-04
US	51257349	RN1L8R4RRWVZS	0812512456	785259686	The Cold One	Books	5	1	1	N	N	!WOW!	This book is great.  The main characters were greatly developed,and so was the plot.  The ending was to put it shortly peacefull.  I know that sounds weird but when you read it you will be greatly surprised how calm the  ending is.  This book is good for anyone over the age of say 14.  Still the  book is one of Pike's adult books so don't think that you will be reading a  tame kiddy booke because it is very far from it.  Although some of his teen  books may help people understand this book better.  Like Spellbound,  Monster, and The Hollow Skull sort of explain alot of the points in the  books.	1999-09-03

Also just like in Chain Letter you never hate the villian but feal there pain and want to help.  I think every character in this book was crafted carefully because they were all so great.  I would  recomend this book to any one.	1999-07-02

He never treats the reader as a child but as a mature person who can handle an intense story line with great characters.  This is my fav by Pike other then the remember me books.	1999-06-24

I mean the story was so cool and the characters were almost alive (well for most of the book).  I mean it also takes a stab and bringing something  new into a story.  This book has a really big issue in it that is facing  alot of teens today... abortion.  I am glad that Mr. Pike is not afraid to  pull all the punches and treat his readers as mature people.  This book was  very creepy with great characters that I wish could have been in more  books.  A MUST!!!!	1999-06-16

I loved all the characters and I nearly cried when I read the last chapter and the epiloge.  This book really summed everything up.  I was so happy with it that I  stayed up all night to finish it.  PLUS!!! The story in the story was very  good and would have made a great single book.  OH WAIT! There is already a  book after &quot;The StarLight Crystal&quot;.  Well this book is a must for  enyone.	1999-06-15

I would say see the movie but the movie was just as bad actually  it was worst. Still this book was OK and I think  you need patience to get  all the way through.	1999-06-09

The only problem I have with the book is how much the book got bogged down in the begging with all the New Age stuff but the ending and great character  devolpment saved this book from a 4.  This book really is for everyone and  a must read for fans of Pike or Remember Me.	1999-06-08

The story works so well and it was so intense that I could not put the book down.  I loved this book so much and I am glad that it wasn't wrecked by uneeded gore.   The only problem I had with the book was all the sex.  I mean it is not to  bad but some times it was a bit over done.  Still the book is really good  and the Epiloge almost made me cry because it was so well written.	1999-06-04
