But ask yourself, honestly- why are you doing this to your mind? Writers who write as badly as the ones dealt with in this tome do so for one reason: intimidation. You're supposed to think, \\"wow this is hard to read. It must mean the writer has a grasp of things I don't. His arbitrarily constructed and half-assed idiolect make me feel befuddled... Ooh... He smart. Me dumb.\\"<br /><br />This is not the case.<br /><br />'Twas the not the case with Schopenhauer, or Rousseau, or Plato, or Nietzsche, or Descartes, or any thinker/writer of substance. Ok, maybe Wittgenstein is hard at times, but his was an original and alien mind... One that struggled, always struggled... Sadly- the 20th C. was a benighted time for original thought. It had wordplay in abundance... but not much thought... one big candy store of thought. Neither caviar nor kale. No beef, no collard greens...<br /><br />Semioticians and post-structuralists and post-mods, whatever: Their all-too-bombastic obscurantism is a sign of their bad faith. These thinkers are dead ends, their basic presuppositions are highly questionable (if not laughable) and their \\"discipline,\\" if one may boldly employ the word in as ironical a way as possible- is a joke. The academic legacy of semiotics is a boil on the face of literature. \\"How many angels can dance oer' the head of a pin,\\" but for post-modernity.<br /><br />So, why are you taking these prating fools seriously? Call them on their bluff... and abandon their books to the fate of not being read.<br /><br />Still, as they go, this is a Good Book, a clear book, albeit on a senseless, worthless and ultimately useless subject. Do you really think in 20 years the corpus of these frauds will have any bearing on the world? Does it now?	2005-02-03

I don't own many chess-books. But I'm picking up a couple of Chernev's other books simply because this one was cheap and great- two things that warm my cockles!<br /><br />As an improving mid-level player, this book helped me a great deal. More than the books I bought on \\"So-and-so's most immortalist, bestest, burnin-brightest games of eternity...\\" maybe I'm not there yet. This book seems a great bridge to help one get from novice to mid-level player (and beyond, I hope). My game has definitely improved, I'm more tenacious in the opening. Which I like.<br /><br />Chernev's style of writing is accessible and often humorous, two good traits. He's quick to tease out the implications of certain moves versus others, making the reader smack his head and take more time. He doesn't get too bogged down- he gives you food for thought and allows for digestion. I can't say enough really.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have taken issue with Chernev's repetitive praise for certain moves and openings (He does marvel at the E-4 a great deal, but always with different words). But they forget- this is not really a book for an expert- it's for lower strength players who need to have certain basic ideas beaten into them. Chernev never makes it feel like he's beating it into you- he just looks at classic ideas from a variety of points of view, and that is wonderfully refreshing! Moreover, you don't (or I didn't) get the feeling that he's talking down to you. And I love the variety of witticisms and famous-player sayings that Chernev tosses out, at random, to illustrate his points. You want to write them all down in a little book...<br /><br />You can tell the man truly loved, LOVED, the game. That comes through as being infectious. The reader picks up on that love and Chernev's excitement and wants to learn more. Such qualities are rare, as teaching goes, I think.<br /><br />Uh... I wish there had been more than one game of Queen's gambit Accepted vs. many of Queen's Gambit Declined, as I love to play that opening. That one game, however, is very instructional (watch that bishop, black!)<br /><br />Just my 3.5 cents.

Bullseye. Along with the chapter on Kant in Will Durant's \\"The Story of Philosophy,\\" this is most thorough-but-brief examination of Kant's Philosophy. I can't even fathom how he did it. Scruton takes care to be as clear as possible when deciphering Kant's original but highly technical idiolect. If you read this book carefully, and then approach Kant's highly involved philosophy: you will see the difference. But. You have to be in for the haul. You may need to reread passages. Kant's works, even when condensed like this, are still foreboding and require much focus and concentration. But he is worth it. Modern thought springs much from Kant's ideas: his influence, not only on 19th Century Philosophy, German Romanticism, and Religious philosophy is ineluctable. I was hooked from the second chapter, wherein Scruton places Kant in his context and illustrates the evolution of his thought. Leibniz's and Hume's influence is dealt with in a fantastic way- a consideration of both thinkers is necessary for a greater understanding.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things. If anyone ever told me that a book of 135 pages of small print with good illustrations could deal effectively with a thinker of this magnitude and verbosity I'd laugh. And I'd have to eat that laughter. I'll say this, it makes Kant pleasurable. A pleasure to read and a greater pleasure to understand. I'd recommend this to anyone with any degree of interest in kant. As Scruton says in his preface, \\"Kant hope to draw the limits of human understanding; he found himself compelled to transcend them.\\" Scruton's V.S.I. is an excellent testament to that vision.	2004-11-08

Don't you love how idiotic grown ups sounds when they try to, like, borrow the vernacular twists of their offspring for ironic employment in a, like, polemical setting? Reminds me of Cusack's dad in 'Better off Dead,' the way he keeps trying to talk to his son on his son's level. There's so much bad faith and pretension permeating this book- it's all there in the title...<br /><br />As for the' author's \\"polemic,\\" it basically consits of numerous, misinformed, tendentious tracts soldered together into a rusty heap. You've heard this spiel before, most likely from your grandparents or parents who just don't get it- that they had their time. This is our era. Our use of language reflects and underlines our differences from those who came before.<br /><br />I particularly didn't like his seeming dismissal/blanket statement on hip hop. He really ain't down with the brothas, which is not surprising, given that he's a black intellectual, and there's nothing established black academics like more than a long-winded, whingeing harangue about the endemic evils of hip hop Kulture. Ugh. He doesn't even seem to possess much of a knowledge of hip hop artists or their work... Nada... There is much that I find execrable in said culture and in it's major 'artists' but still how can one overlook its myriad unifying and artistic elements... Even I manage not to fall prey to an all-too-easy reductionist formula, which seems to be the The main point here- the author views the degredation of the english Language through the lens of pop culture at large (as a bad thing, mind you), it begins in the evil counterculture 60's and... you know...<br /><br />Digressive, ranting out-of-context mixed with counter-intuitive psuedo-linguistic gibberish. For example, the author holds up both Dylan and Tom waits as examples of artists who are reverred not for their songwriting abilities, but more for their authenticity, thir 'genuineness'. This is plain false. Laughably false. I've never met a fan of either artist who wasn't struck by their strange and completely idiosyncratic use of language. Moreover, the author seems to feel that pop culture music is driven by whites emulating blacks. True, up to a point. I love this stance, and from Chuck Berry to James Brown to Miles Davis to Funkadelic to Fishbone to Bad Brains, to the innumerable black influences on The Clash, I will never tire of pointing out that, basically, it's all black music. One would think that, at least on some level, this is a good thing... But no, it leads back to the counter-kulture (with a k) ideals that have subverted language...????<br /><br />HUH?<br /><br />The saddest thing is that, as a reactionary elitist, I'm inclined to agree with many of the author's basic points.

It could be worse, like the hatchet job below that prompted me to write this. First things first: anyone who is pretentious/affectatious enough to quote Nietzsche solely in his original German- a quote that is all the more obscure for its reference to 'Seneca and his ilk,' (the title) and its borrowing of a Latin coin of phrase- has already demonstrated his bad faith. I'm talking about the next reviewer. You see; he's not assuming that you will posses a working knowledge of German so that you will catch his all-too-coy reference. He simply wants to intimidate you with his high and mighty linguistic flourishes. \\"I CAN QUOTE NIETZSCHE IN THE ORIGINAL AREN\\"T I SO FRIKKIN SMART NOW YOU HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO MY INTELLECTUAL OPINIONS!!! He seems to scream.<br /><br />He comes not to discuss but to brag and condescend- he doesn't give an accurate rendering of Amery's book, he merely reveals the depths of his own extremely beknighted 'Weltanshaaung.' Here is the translation of said piece, from \\"The Joyful Science,\\" (a wonderful book and one deserving of a better reader) It is the 34th song,<br /><br />\\"They write and write their intolerably sagacious Larifari,<br />As if it 'gaelt primum scribere,<br />Deinde philosophari.' (meaning 'first to write then to philosophize.')<br /><br />IMHO, the statement applies far more readily to the reviewer employing it than the book he reviews. Yes, Amery attempted suicide before writing this and then ended up succeeding some time after. Yes, Amery does employ a pseudo-existentialist vocabulary in order to make sense of his predicament. But he has no pretense that he speaks for mankind. He simply dislikes the various ways in which society seeks to make sense/marginalize/cure the phenomenon of suicide, and he espouses a different tact, in understanding it. He believes that the act is one a person can approach and commit with dignity and clear-mindedness. Make what you will of that. It calls to mind the opening chapter of Camus, \\"The Myth of Sisyphus,\\" which is, at heart, another mediation on suicide, albeit from a different perspective again.<br /><br />His suicide in no means destroys or stains his observations and ideas. I have all three of Amery's books, and I unhesitatingly recommend each one. I'm not planning on killing myself, and my feelings on the subject are ambivalent. Still, I find J. Amery to be refreshingly clear, immediate and concise. He avoids jargoneering and tendentiousness, and never stoops to pathos. He writes in a persuasive and at times subtly humorous fashion. He isn't trying to get the world to kill itself en masse, and he's not trying to get your child to put its head in an oven. He simply wants to discuss and examine, as objectively as possible (though he admits that it is not) the idea that life (under certain conditions) may not be worth living. This is one of the few books on suicide that actually had a great deal of profundity. Worth the read.<br /><br />The third reviewer is also spot-on... I would also recommend A. Alvarez' \\"The Savage God,\\" for a book that seeks to confront artistic self-destruction, among other things. \\"In Darkness,\\" by James A. Wechsler is another book that approaches the phenomena from a familial point of view.rt, another mediation on suicide, albeit from a different perspective again.

Byron once claimed that his own sense of tragedy was dreived from Alfieri. Say no more. This brilliant soul, like Kleist, Racine, Buchner, Lenz, Holderlin, Corneille and many others: they've been relegated to the attics and cobwebs of their own nationalities and the endless, tendentious posturing of localized academe. Boxed up. Locked away. In a trunk with FOR PROFESSORS AND GRAD STUDENTS ONLY!!! scrawled large upon the surface...<br /><br />This is sad- this man's work's especialy 'Saul' and 'Mirra' are bursting with a sense of the tragic not often utilized, epsecially in this day and age where every goddam, sappy Oscar-winning film has to have some kind of pseudo-happy-ending/idiotic life affirming moral tacked on so as to conform with flinching audience's expectations and testing results. No one wants and honest and unflinching depiction of life and the pain of being human.<br /><br />However! For those with the might of soul needed to confront great literature, Alfieri is up there. Way the hell up there. One can definitely see the influence on Byron in terms of both style (condensed/perfected neo-classicism- despite his 'Romantic,' tagline, Byron looked down sneeringly on his contemporaries who succumbed to the many execrable urges of the Romantic movement, his style was far too precise to be Romantic, and both he & Goethe both shared a triumph of style over their Romantic roots, also a condescension towards those who were unable to do likewise) and also the content- 'Mirra' for example, is a tragedy of incest, something not tackled by most squeamish 17th C. prats and something with much bearing on Byron's personality (he rated it superior to any other modern drama, save Faust- also once, he fainted ((imagine Byron fainting?!!!?)) at a performance of 'Mirra'). He used the name for the name of his heroine in 'Sardanapalus.'<br /><br />Pick up a used copy of this. It will reinvigorate your life!	2004-09-28

Either you understand/respect/follow him out of the Heideggerian 'Clearing' or you start hacking therough the dense and tangled undergrowth and make your own path. I've never felt much affinity for his magnum opus, 'Truth and Method,' but then, all of Heidegger's belabored philosophical children leave me a tad cold... Hannah, Karl, Hans... The only one I felt had something new to say was Levinas. So let's just say that, 'ideologically' I'm not an enemy- just a contender.<br /><br />You buy this- you get jargon juggling. Lots of jargon juggling. Little substance. I wonder what Celan would have made of this, as he too was very influenced by H's opus, Being and Time, he kept an annotated copy with him. This 'engagement,' as it is described, is another shred of soulless, brittle, and all-too obscurantist work that drains the lifeblood of Celan, page by page. The essay, \\"Who Am I and Who Are You?\\" Didn't seem to get anywhere on that topic. Endlessly tangential. Painfully dry.<br /><br />It's strikes me as odd that Celan seemd able to draw upon Heidegger more deeply and interestingly than Lowith, Gadamer, et al... Most academic reformulation, elaborations of the H-ian legacy come off as tendentious posturing- weilding academic lingo as a blunt plank with which one beats one's readers into unconsciousness.<br /><br />Beware. Get the Felstiner work, if anything. Or better yet... Let Celan speak for himself.	2004-09-23

An exceptionally lucid series of interviews with one of the most central, misunderstood and neglected thinkers of the 20th C.

I found this much more rewarding and illuminating than some of his more weighty tomage.<br />Good for recovering academics, practicing theorists, intellectual dilletantes and anyone else interested in adopting an ethically based philosophy that can stand up and go toe to toe with all those wily postmodernists with their impenetrable and convoluted jargon of hubris...	2004-06-07

I mentioned it to my grandmother and danextthingya'know- I get it as a gift.<br />...<br />I never thought I would encounter a tome that could make beloved Pushkin a chore... Admittedly, most Russian poetry simply does NOT work in translation. Pushkin is fatally demonstrative of this- I can't think of one good translator of his works. In other words, you need to know Russian to get it. There's no way around that. The able-bodied pedant who compiled this massive belch is certianly no exception (one clue to his agenda and bad faith is that he only uses his own translations, which I will kindly describe as among the worst I have ever perused). It's sad because during my internment at the state vomitorium I expected having to work through dry, long-winded academic treatments of Bely, Blok, Babel, Bulgakov... (and kept hearing Malcolm McDowell intone in my skull, \\"I've suffered the tortures of the damn sir, the tortures of the damned\\") But Pushkin's legend, his death, his black heritage, his violently tempestuous life- it all seemed to me to be as boredom-proof as his poetry.<br />I now stand corrected.<br />I recently read a review of this on the exile.ru's online zine. I cannot improve upon Dr. Dolan's critique, I'm just pointing you in the right direction... Seek and ye shall find.<br />I defy you to read through this sludge. The first page alone will make you feel as if you have aged ten damn years, like the torture machine in The Princess Bride. The only good thing I can say about this is that it is thoroughly, insidiously, well-researched.

Reasonably priced too.<br />Also, as a final tempt- If you know a young woman who is imaginative and literary minded, and you want to reinforce those qulaities (quite  task in this day and age) you should get her this.

GENIUS of American letters, post-WWII. No one can match his breadth of vision, his uncanny ability to make his perceptions and dreams work while undermining one's sense of reality and existence as objective. He makes the lit-theory sci-fi jargonmeisters (Pynchon and Delillo, for example) look like the drivel-laden frauds they so clearly are; they write solely to ensure that lit-theory academics can continue their pointless little lives in their ivory towers and not have to work for a living- a relationship that works quite well for all involved, save those few elect that cherish honest literature... I see that damn blurb on many reviews of Dick's works- \\"The poor man's Pynchon,' what absolute tripe. In fact, Pynchon is the dickless man's Dick.<br />At any rate, ranting aside, this little novel, published around the time of the first centennial passing of our Civil War, concerns a man (Louis Rosen) who is drawn into a relationship with his business partner's daughter (Pris Frauenzimmer): a cold, spiteful, driven, vicious woman (Dick's prototypical 'dark-haired girl,' a theme that reoccurs throughout his fiction) who creates simulacra of historical personages. These people she creates- one Abe Lincoln, and one Edwyn M. Stanton (Lincoln's Secretary of War) represent two potential poles of human experience- Stanton quickly adapts to the new world and becomes a shrewd advisor to Rosen's company while Lincoln can't really adapt to the world or the fact that he's a robot version of himself. Lincoln eventually becomes an idiot savant/mentor to Louis, who gradually succumbs to insanity and loss...<br />It's an odd novel, not of the typical sci-fi adventure mode, and not your standard Dickian, hard-working everyman tries to figure out the nature of reality-type scenario. Still, it's an inimitably poignant little novel, one that ends abruptly and without much resolution. I really dig it.

If this were the standard by which writers judged their own works, well, amazon would have far fewer books to sell.<br />If you are looking for a glimpse of what life was 'like' during Stalin's reign in Russia, if you are looking for an unflinching view of humanity and 'utopian' projects, or if you are looking for the most eloquent and disturbing memoir I have ever read- well, here, all I can do is add my empty two-cents.	2004-04-20
US	29683936	R3TEMWOCDMG88F	1840460717	996432171	Introducing Marquis De Sade	Books	5	31	31	N	N	The best (if not only) intro to De Sade	I'm writing this to balance out the nay-saying. I think the Totem series is fairly hit or miss. It depends on whomever is handling the info. For example, their `Introducing Machiavelli' and `Introducing Descartes,' are remarkably wonderful. Then you have, `Introducing Postmodernism,' and `Introducing Baudrilliard,' both of which suck, in my humble opinion. I don't know- the closer that Totem gets to the 20th C, the more they tend to fail... Their books on Wittgenstein and Nietzsche, for example, are on the good side of decent... With Foucault, Heidegger and Barthes, they really loose some steam (surprisingly, I like the Deridda book immensely, which stands out...)<br />`Introducing De Sade' stands easily in the former category. It's simply great! It is a dense, worthwhile and illuminating effort that succeeds in every way. It puts the man in his Enlightenment context, contrasting him with other thinkers of his era. It gives a thorough biographical account of his life and his work's chronological development. It also handles later writer's use and misuse of De Sade.<br />I'm a big fan of this book for a number of reasons.<br />1. There isn't much out there on De Sade that provides a suitable introduction to him (and his novels are nigh-unendurable, in terms of their tedious repetitions and long-winded philosophical discourse. You HAVE to be in it for the long haul to plod through them).<br />2. De Sade is still a very neglected thinker, despite the fact that he was honest and highly original. This book looks at each of his main works and seeks to understand them on their own ground. Then it attempts to flesh out the underlying systematic philosophy behind the pornography, succeeding admirably I think.<br />Ultimately, I just don't understand all the negative reviews. The book is a humorous discussion, but an honest and thorough one nonetheless. I don't think the book makes fun of `De Sade,' and even if were to do so, that would be preferable to the treatment the Marquis receives from comp lit purveyors around the globe- coddling him and treating him as a `moralist,' who `really didn't mean it.' De Sade dressed up as a moralist is about as funny as Hitler dressed up as a nun. He spent a good portion of hislife incarcerated and I can guarantee that he meant every (...) word! Which reminds me, there are lots of improper and naughty pictures in this, ohhhh! Beware.<br />At any rate, If you don't know much about this controversial and fascinating figure- this is the best place to start, I think.the Marquis receives from comp lit purveyors around the globe- coddling him and treating him as a `moralist,' who `really didn't mean it.'

If you got this far, please, engage yourself and read the sample pages that amazon has allowed to be shown here.<br />This work is not just an eloquent attempt of one man to make sense of himself and his history, it is also by far the most sensitive, interesting (and accessible) treatment of Hegel the world has yet to see (including Marx- even though Du Bois spent the later years of his life smitten with socialism and the USSR- a viewpoint that eventually led him to abandon the NAACP's ((which he helped found in 1910)) agenda of integration).<br />One could spend much time tracing Du Bois' intellectual movements and his confrontations (as with Booker T. Washington). I won't attempt that here. Instead I'll attempt a cursory revealing of his Hegelian sensibilities. I don't use the word debt, because Du Bois doesn't borrow from Hegel- he resurrects him.<br />Du Bois's understanding of himself as a `problem,' is as illuminating now as it was in 1903. I think at least a cursory engagement with Hegel is needed to truly understand this book and Du Bois' thought in its entirety. For that reason I highly suggest you purchase the critical Norton version of this book (ISBN: 039397393X). It adds a great deal. The preface alone is worth the ten-note...<br />The master/slave dialectic, as well the unfolding and development of a consciousness of freedom: Du Bois breathes life into this system of `necessary' rational progression. Hegel himself traced the development of `World Spirit,' through six historical peoples: Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, Greeks, Romans and Germans. This forms the genesis of Du Bois' conception of black Americans as historically a, \\"...sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and gifted with second-sight in this American world,- a world which yields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through the revelation of the other world... One ever feels his twoness, - an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\\"<br />And that's just page 3. If Hegel himself had been this eloquent... Ah well...<br />Du Bois once wrote of his heritage that it included &quot;a flood of Negro blood, a strain of French, a bit of Dutch, but, Thank God! No 'Anglo-Saxon'...&quot; There is much to be admired in that statement's forwardness, and there is much to be understood and reconciled in its anger. As a white American, I have a cultural debt to black Americans, one that I will never be able to pay back. But the impossibility of a task does not preclude one from not attempting it.<br />Today America is as divided by race as it ever was. Honest dialogue is the only solution.

I love it and cart it around everywhere- so much so that my wife took to calling me `Schopey,' soon after we married. Oh what a kidder... The text in question is basically an abbreviated form of \\"Parerga and Paralipomena,\\" a collection of, you guessed it, essays and aphorisms that Arthur published towards the end of his life. In fact, he owed much of his early popularity to these little bits of brain, blood and bile- they paved the way for the interest in his earlier, more thorough and more intimidating work- `The World as Will and Representation,' his central text. Intense, brooding, and enthrallingly lucid (a trait much lacking in philosophy in general and German philosophy in particular), these little pensees and barbs will provide you with much enjoyment, quotes, quips and boundless food for thought. If you are at all the kind of person who enjoys reading, or if you are buying books with such a person in mind (and if you weren't I don't see how you would have ended up here) I cannot say enough good things about this tiny volume!<br />Whether or not you agree with Schopenhauer's central philosophic themes, his high-jacking/hybridization of Kantian metaphysics and Eastern Vedic/Buddhist Scripture, his pessimistic misanthropy, his irrational and intuitive bent, his (huge) influence on psychology and psychoanalysis, his dismissal of Judeo-Christian religion, or his overbearing arrogance- he is not a thinker to be dismissed lightly. I disagree with him on practically everything important (as did Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy notwithstanding), except his scathing misanthropy and his views on opera (page 163- he loathed it by the way, as a philistine piling up of styles, an `unmusical invention for unmusical minds...'), but so what?<br />His views, maxims and opinions are straightforwardly put with all the deceptive elegance of a minor key Chopin Nocturne. A refreshing break from the tireless jargon-juggling of contemporary, pomo, academic charlatans... And the man was brilliant. The kind of brilliance that engenders humility in readers and makes young, would-be philosophers reconsider their choice of profession. You cannot help but enter into dialogue with this man. And hey- All you young, winsome, despairing, romantically-inclined teenagers- take note! This guy was the real deal, it takes serious cajones to spit in the face of the Enlightenment and proclaim to the progress-minded 19th C. that, \\"Unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of existence, then our existence must have no object whatever,\\" (which is the first sentence in this nice little book) and then back that statement up with serious argumentation. And as a literary influence Schopenhauer is in a league entirely of his own. Thomas Mann is unthinkable without him (well, and Nietzcsche). Borges once opined that the only thinkers he thought accurately depicted the world were Schopenhauer and Berkeley.<br />Finally, The introduction by Hollingdale is .. superb. It is possibly the best brief introduction to Schopenhauer (by way of Kant and 19th C. trends in German philosophy) that I have come across; it manages to be (simultaneously) anecdotal, psychological, historical, humorous and analytic- all in under 40 pages. No easy achievement, that. It should be noted that Hollingdale is a fine scholar/translator; his work with the late, great Walter Kaufmann on a variety of his Nietzsche translations comes to mind, as does his own fantastic critical biography, `Nietzsche: The Man and His Philosophy,' which still may be the best work of its kind in terms of its approachability.<br />My only beef with Hollingdale is minor: he doesn't mention the effects of the `Nachmearz,' (a period in the mid 19th C. Germany, following revolts in 1848, wherein the public became disenchanted with `academic' philosophy and turned to more literary-outsider intellectuals) as influential in producing the kind of cultural climate in which a thinker and writer suchas Schopenhauer could find a mass readership. This is odd because in `The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche,' Hollingdale discusses (at length) the far-reaching effects of said cultural phenomenon in producing the legends that permeate the widespread public perception of Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer...<br />But I digress. Cheap copies of this are abound. Do yourself a massive favor, live a little- take a chance, as Nietzsche did, when he was a college student, nosing about in a bookstore...such as Schopenhauer could find a mass readership.

As an avowed atheist, I don't care for much of the content at work in West's treatment's of various cultural phenomena. I disagree with him on most of his more important ideas. And he isn't as critical of urban black culture as he should be (I think, and therein lies my own bias), given his own Chehkovian-Christian foundation...<br />But if we read only the thinkers with whom we had profound agreement- what would that make of our perceptions? Without dialogue there is no community...<br />He deals with the seemingly contradictory elements at work in the human character in an interesting, if psuedo-absurdist fashion. And his optimism isn't a naive optimism, though, as I mentioned before, I think he has on cultural blinders. I also thinks he tends to romanticize various nihilisic phenomena deeply entrenched in black culture- his dalliance with hip-hop belies both his idealization of that culture and his need to be appreciated as 'authentic' by modern black America, a culture that seems (at least to me) to be quite anti-intellectual in any respects. How does a Harvard Doctor transcend his own thoughtful nature in order to initiate dialogue with both sides of the racial divide in America? Let's be honest here, America is a country that has bee, is and most likely always will be deeply obseessed with questions of race and identity. This puts Dr. West in an interesting position and it's illuminating to watch him wrestle with both the angels and demons of his fate...<br />I should add that Dr. West is a highly original and incisive thinker, a fine literary craftsman, and, I think, a boldly provocative scholar, in his own right, especially considering that he works within that bloated uber-vampire of university-systems, Harvard... Ultimately, his views enrich my own and enable me to more fully articulate my diffrences with him.<br />Finally, his thoughts on aesthetics (his insights into Chehkov are probably the most interesting of the non-russian treatments) and the black experience (as when he writes on Coltrane) are sublime.

Its corporations pillage the face of the world with impunity (one need look no further than the president's cabinet and those fortunate Haliburton stockholders so decently pitching in to, *rebuild* Iraq!) and, yet, alas, no one loves us. Our populace is loathed far and wide. Why? It's not like we have anything to do with it right? We just live here... It's not as if we're a nation of illiterate, self-righteous, bovine jerks that have abdicated any sense of global (or national) obligation... How come nobody likes us? Even our allies...<br /><br />So sad- But just when you thought all was lost, here comes some bought-off Frog, whispering- \\"NO. it's not American foreign policy and unchecked corporate greed. It's Europe's desperate desire to 'project our faults onto America so as to absolve ourselves.' That's the REAL problem. And boy is that one mama-yama!<br /><br />Whew. Well, now I can sleep again. Oh, and Revel also strokes our collective egos by reminding us how the US has guided the destiny of the world ever since we won WWII. Which actually struck me as kinda odd, since I thought it was RUSSIA, with its tens of millions of military and civilian casualties, bleeding the Germans dry on the Eastern front and felling 85% (rounded down) of all the German casualties in the war, that turned the tide against the Nazis. In fact, Military historians date the war's turning point two years before D-Day when, at Stalingrad, the Soviets eradicated 50-freakin' divisions from the Axis order of battle. Or perhaps the year before when, at Kursk, the Red Army annihilated the Wehrmacht's strategic tank force, breaking the Nazis' capacity for large-scale attacks. And, hey, wasn't it the Red Army that liberated Auschwitz? But what do I know, obviously I'm just some self-hating pinko degenerate, prowling the streets of Anytown, USA with hairy palms, right?<br /><br />Revel also notes how the EU is being run into the ground. Well, we all knew that! That's why the iron dollar is faring so well against the Euro. Your tax cuts at work... Are we at 3/4 the Euro yet? Ah, tremble at the might of our mighty dollar, all ye foreign-types! Avert thine eyes! And I just read that the Russian ruble has appreciated against the dollar, in the past month. Oh Well, it just means that us chosen, the freedom-mongers, can get more bang for our buck at the nearest village product-collective, er, I mean Wal-Mart. Hmmmmm... Now that I think about it...<br /><br />But don't worry!<br /><br />Globalism will save us! Revel is here to reassure us of this too, and he shows how all those angry Europeans are traitors to the cause of free-market economics and that most benign of isms- globalism! Say it with me, and say it loud!<br /><br />Never mind those uppity spics who walked out of the Cancun talks, they'll learn their place! And never mind that the Russian electorate recently dumped their 'Democrats' (SPS and Yabloko) in the most recent election (seeing as how globalism in Russia, in the 90's, basically translated into 'everything stolen by former party functionaries with state money- no jobs, and general hell on earth'). For those of you not in the know- Russia just overwhelmingly voted in a Duma that is as anti-capitalist and anti-neo-liberal as it is anti-Western. Oh no! If those pesky, ungrateful Ruskies don't watch out, they may end up just like France!!!! Gasp! Every Russian's worst nightmare- a first world country with 35 a hour work week, low crime and a coast on the Mediterranean.<br /><br />Globalism... \\"Hey all you third world nations, just sign (your souls, economic assets and mineral rights) on the dotted line or risk experiencing the long end of America's economic stick. Those who don't will be shown for the whinging totalitarian/fascist/terrorist states they are.\\" Kinda Like what happened last year in Venezuela, when Bush's former mouthpiece, Ari Fleischer declared of the coup by military junta (that overthrew a popularly elected president), \\"Now the situation will be one of calm and tranquility.\\" Unfortunately the popular Chavez was returned to power.

This is my favorite work by Pelevin, a writer who tends to frustrate the hell out me, especially where his most recent novels are concerned.<br />Most of these stories are absurdist gems, in my opinion, and a couple of them (most notably the magnificent \\"Hermit and Six-Toes,\\" the austere \\"The tambourine of the Upper World,\\" and the endearingly sweet \\"Adventures of Shed XII\\") easily stand amongst my favorite short stories of all time.<br />\\"Hermit And Six Toes\\": Not many writers can pull off a story that magically works as a satire of communist thought, an illuminating discourse on the search for meaning and truth in life, and a cute story about two chickens stuck in a meat factory. If I were ever to assemble a coursebook of philosophic fiction, \\"Hermit and Six Toes\\" would be in there with the best of Borges, Marquez, Babel, Calvino, Dick, and a couple others.<br />\\"the Tambourine of The Upper World\\" is an odd little mystical story that concerns death and marriage, albeit in a wayou're not expecting at all.<br />And \\"...Shed XII,\\" wow. If anyone else tried to craft a short story about a shed the wants to be a bicycle... I wince at the thought of pomo jargonists who would just make a huge mess. But Pelevin's story is just that, a heart-rendingly effective tale about a shed that wants to be a bike. I walk away shaking my head every time I finish it, asking, \\"How did he do that?\\" A kid would love it (in fact my little brother did a book report on that story in the fifth grade!)<br />That's the thing I guess, some of these stories can be universally appreciated, whereas I can't imagine anyone under the age of 20 finding much enjoyment in any of Pelevin's novels.<br />Now, concerning the reviews... The average reviewer seems to think his novels are better than his short stories. The avergae rating of this (paperback only, the HB has aFIVE STAR RATING, I wonder why the discrepancy?) is three stars. That troubles me as, \\"Omon Ra,\\" gets four and a half, as does \\"Buddha's Lil Finger,\\" (formerly known as The Clay Machine Gun). I think both works start out strong, drag a bit towards the middle and resolve in a fairly decent manner (Omon Ra has a pretty tight and unexpected finish, and I enjoyed the cosmonaut's discussions of Pink Floyd's \\"Atom Heart Mother\\"). But Pelevin really shines in his stories, he stays on focus and doesn't overload them with befuddling, pseudo-Buddhist, semi-mystical meanderings. And I even like stuff like that, I think its fun, its my bag. But his novels have tooooooo much of a good thing.<br />\\"The Life of Insects,\\" is enjoyable, although it leans heavily on a Russian theft of Kafka. \\"A werewolf problem in central Russia,\\" is also a fine collection of stories.

I liked the title, simple and evocative, so I looked through the book. I was startled by how good the poems were, the thoughts and musings gave language and structure to a part of me that I had always sensed but had never been able to articulate fully (which is what good poetry should do, I think- it should reveal to the reader- and to the poet- aspects of the self and the world, that were unknown or unfelt before).<br />I don't usually enjoy books of poetry. Most contemporary poets can't hold me for long- Eliot, and Stevens are pretty much the only exceptions (Hughes ((Ted, not Langston, lest there be any misunderstanding)) is one too, but only for &quot;Crow,&quot; which is another touchstone for me- a slim volume of which I will never tire).<br />Almost seven years later this is still a book I re-read constantly. My copy is torn, and filled with notes in the margins, my favorite lines are underlined. Here are some...<br />&quot;To escape possession/ Is to give up things/ And their voices.&quot;<br />from 'Possessed'<br />&quot;He is sweating like a penny in the hand. The street is paved with voices/ Speaking in a language he can no longer understand.&quot;<br />from 'Learning'<br />&quot;It was a season of fists/ in the ache of an invisible moon.&quot;<br />&quot;It was a preview of eternity:/ The buried treasures of the self/ All dug up and open to view/ Like a city judged and forgiven.&quot;<br />from, 'A Change'<br />&quot;I was like a leaf in a panic of trees.&quot;<br />from 'Away'<br />&quot;And midnight presses/ Its pennies/ And we awake from darkness/ To a tree lit by eyes.&quot;<br />from 'Horses'<br /><br />All those lines are torn, bloodily, from their snug contexts- a disservice perhaps but one with which I can live. If you enjoyed them or felt anything from them, I encourage you to buy one of the many used copies of this floating around the net.	2004-01-29

They head out west and have a number of small misadventures (they find Jesus) culminating in the creation of a small shelter for those in need.<br />Bellone really puts you into this world- the way he ties in little things, the details come alive and are not over-written: the loopy mismatched chunks of carpet that they use for the shelter, the scenes in Vegas when they're camping by the lake, the strange Christian cult that takes them in. Every scene is fully realized and you wonder if Bellone has made his hero's trek before and is speaking from experience.<br />And you ask yourself if the narrator is truly out of his mind or just another self-involved ... He's your typical Gen-X everyman, and yet the guy is lovable. He's a failure and he knows it, but he can't help but try to become something more. He wants to be a part of something pure, but either knowingly or otherwise- he undermines himself repeatedly, usually through no fault of his own. So many have tried to craft this simple character before and most have fallen on their faces- trying to turn the slackers and wasted masses of our generation as a symbol for x, y or q. Bellone avoids that pitfall and his narrator is all the more lifelike for it.<br />I won't blow the finale, but it stunned me. I should have been prepared for it- and if the characters had been the typical cardboard cutouts or pretentious fey academics littering most pomo American drivel, well I would have predicted the end and not cared. But because Bellone's characters were so well constructed (the dialogue is pitch-perfect and the narrator's inner voice- his unfailing ability to call himslef on his own crap and wonder at his own, well, idiocy- it floored me) I was shocked. I've re-read it twice since finishing it the first time.<br />Having perused a great deal of garbage in my life, It was like I was the ditzy actress-date in 'Harold and Maude,' when she squeals, \\"Ohhhhhhh! It had the ring of truth!\\"<br />My thanks go out to the eXile (.ru), and Dr. Dolan, for reviewing this- it was well worth it. I bought a copy. I'll get another for my brother.n, well, idiocy- it floored me) I was shocked.

First, a quote from Nietzsche's \\"The Birth of Tragedy,\\" the spirit of which I'd swear animates this novel...<br />\\"...An old legend has it that King Midas hunted a long time in the woods for the wise Silenus, companion of Dionysos, without being able to catch him. When he had finally caught him the king asked him what he considered man's greatest good. The daemon remained sullen and uncommunicative until finally, forced by the king, he broke into a shrill laugh and spoke: \\"Ephemeral wretch, begotten by accident and toil, why do you force me to tell you what it would be your greatest boon not to hear? What would be best for you is quite beyond your reach: not to have been born, not to be, to be nothing. But the second best is to die soon.\\"<br />Ok- here's the deal. Either you go in for the bleak, unredemptive, unflinching view of humanity and existence, or you don't. I loved this book. It cut me to the bone and I was glad for it. Houellebecq takes apart our desires, our dreams, our age, all our petty cultural trappings- and exposes them for the broken props that they are. Even The sci-fi bookends of the novel didn't grate too badly, though it ended abruptly.<br />Houellebecq presents a worldview that only a scabrous, self-hating continental intellectual could craft so well. And thank Doug for that! This is a nihilistic work of highest caliber, a descendant of Celine (though H's misanthropy and nihilism aren't the same strain of gleeful, musical hate as Celine's), Hamsun and Huysmans. So be warned, all is not roses and puppy dogs. Humanity, nature, the world in which we live are reviled in a variety of insights, characters and plotlines, none of which end happily. Incidentally, Celine is even channelled, you might say, in the novel, when Bruno, sickened and humiliated by his own powerlessness attempts to publish some racist tracts in a journal, a la everyone's favorite fascist of the 30's.<br />Both of the main characters (Bruno and Michel) are offered chances at making a good life for themselves, despite their failings as humans... Both are given a chance at happiness, or, perhaps a bovine contentment... I'll let you find for yourself what happens.<br />Now, Even if you disagree with any of the perceptions and theories presented in this vitriolic little book, it is still a good thing for you to be exposed to them, as it can only result in you holding your own views with a larger frame of mind. I found this book to be a much needed dose of cold, bathos-sterilizing refreshment. Ah!king a good life for themselves, despite their failings as humans...

I couldn't put this down, read it in one afternoon on a bench by the bay. Marquez has created a world entirely of his own, this isn't Columbia in the 17th Century, nor is it some dreamscape stalked by nightmarish figures. This is a tale of robust power, dealing with lust, love, sickness, transgression, madness, faith, frailty, flesh and loss. In this world presented to us, each of them swirl together until you can't distinguish them from each other. The lives of the people in the pages: the rotting, resigned father; the impassioned atheist doctor; the brilliant, doomed and tormented priest; the deluded sex-crazed mother; the drooping slaves; the vindictive nuns... and at the heart- the crimson-haired little girl as a primal force of nature- incomprehensible, vibrant, fierce... A resounding laugh in the faces of the Stoics who intoned- \\"Live According to Nature.\\" The writing bursts with energy, with poetry, with blood and bile and pale venom- you can almost smell the pages sweat. Few books evoke so much with so little (it's very short, after all). This is a fine novel, an abundant and wretched dream that will possess you for as long as you immerse yourself in it.	2004-01-29
US	29683936	R3H51ZM8R7KIEY	0571102476	74336285	The Black Book	Books	5	27	32	N	N	One of my favorite books. Gorgeous use of language.	This is a magnificent book. The legend around it is that Durrell sent the manuscript for this to Henry Miller, in Paris, and asked that he read it and then toss it in the Seine... Miller read it, and obviously did not cast it away, instead helped to have it published... TS Eliot was one of the guys responsible for getting this out. So goes the name dropping...<br />Now, I'm not a fan of Miller's works. Sue me, the guy just doesn't appeal to my sensibilities... And most of Lawrence Durrell's later novels don't do much for me either- I'm not sure what it is, I feel like the power of The Black Book, all its vigor and spleen, all that lyrical spite became diminished, somehow. I love the language of this book. The fisrt couple pages- I can read them over and over. I've read them to my little brother, my mother, several girlfriends...<br />All values are personal in their manifestation- as I said, I have read parts of this (my favorite parts) to people before and they were not as moved as I was. So I'm not claiming this to be the key text that will unlock 20th C. literature for you (look to Celine for that!). It's just highly reccommended to you as an angry denunciation of a world long gone. The author is trapped in his values, his place, his class and he wants to burn it all away, tear it all down- all the emptiness, the lack of connection, the bald hypocrisy and the babbling of the masses. The lies and the desolate souls around him that murmur... But he can't help loving the world he loathes, the beauty and transience of it... and can't help but loathe himself for loving it... I'm rambling... And I haven't said a thing about plot or characters... So be it.<br />If you are a fan of Isaac Babel, Platonov, John Kennedy Toole, Charles Portis, TS Eliot, Sartre, Henry Miller, Wallace Stevens, John Fowles, Calvino, Tibor Fischer, Unamuno, Burroughs... There's some slice of similarity in all those writers...	2004-01-26

When I finished this novel I didn't know if I loved it or hated it. I had never had that reaction to a work of literature before. I did know that I could not put it down, and that means a lot to me. I needed to know what happened to Lauren and Michel.<br />If a book doesn't capture me in the first twenty pages or so I tend not to stick with it- I think writers either have it or they don't. This book pissed me off but also made me track down all his other novels- a singular experience for me. So far I have been equally elated (The sea came in at midnight) and dismayed (Rubicon Beach) by his works, often in the same novel (Arc d'X).<br />I'm not only discussing &quot;Days Between Stations,&quot; here...<br />Now then- as regards Erickson: his writing is lush, highly rich and poetic. He weaves astute psychological insights in with chaotic and seemingly random hyper-conscious details when describing the inner workings of those who populate his works. The characters and worlds that Erickson crafts veer from heart-wrenching and lovingly-detailed to maddeningly, utterly book-tossingly, non-sensical. Out of nowhere- the most surreal occurences materialize and take over the narrative, often destroying my patience and aggravating the living hell out of me.<br />Yet there is a pay-off. He weaves fantastic stories and he does it in a way that is wholly his own- no one writes like Erickson. For all his flights of post-modern fancy I can't help but get wrapped up in the intricately-realized, labyrinthine details of the lives in his stories. days Bewteen stations is a great example of this- the chapters on the making of the silent film and the betrayal that finalizes it... I was stunned. For all Erickson's words (and he is wordy as hell) there is something still lurking between the musings and the poetry and the cast of strange, naked souls that inhabit his dystopian visions of the world as it was and will be... I can never put my finger on this pulse of his and that wil always bring me back to him. It really angers me at times- because I think a great deal of the wreckless way he imposes discontinuity and hellish non-sense is, well, kinda empty and pointless. But it makes for a ride like no other.<br />A caveat- I tend not to go for woefully pomo writers and Erickson is cerainly one of those. I stormed away from &quot;Arc D'X&quot; (despite LOVING the first fifty-odd pages) God-knows how many times before finishing it. Still haven't finished Rubicon Beach. His interviews (there are many online) don't really clarify things but I suspect he wants it that way.<br />I reccommend him.bring me back to him.

Sartre chose Gerassi	One of the best sartre bios out there (and the official one). Volume One- It has the dual fortune of being both a quick read and a decent intro to Sartre's life and thought. It also calls him on his *ish*, which is rare for biographers. (Gerassi's parents were Spanish -ok his mom wasn't but married into it- friends of Sartre and Simone De Beauvoir, in fact both his mother and father as well as Jean hismelf became the basis for characters in sartre's 'Roads to Freedom' Series of novels).<br />While not as massive a compendium as the Annnie Cohen-Solal bio, this has much to reccommend it. In fact, preciseley that it is not the massive compendium reccommends it in my eyes. Who has time for that but the intellectual janitors in their ivory towers? Gerassi knows Sarte's works quite well, but primarily- he knew the man himself and he gives interesting insights into many anecdotes and ideas.<br />My feelings towards Sartre tend to be passionately ambivalent. I don't care for his philosophy, which will always be 'cool' to the pseudo-sophisticates who don't even possess a thorough grasp of it... I was enchanted with him in my teens mainly because of his persuasive skill with words (the man was an extraordinary wordsmith), and I will always be deeply enamored of his novels. 'nausea,' alone I feel should secure his place in the history of literature.<br />There are tons of works on Sartre purporting to unveil his thought and life. Most of the ones I've read are inadequate- they come off as hack-kneyed and reactionary, and try to compensate for their faults with an over-abundance of fruitless linguistic play that goes nowhere- does nothing, or they take him to task overly for a variety of his personal failings (and there are plenty from which to choose). Few thinkers and biographers attempt to tackle the man as a writer and an activist... Few try to work with Sartre's all-too-human imperfections and put them into context.<br />...And few see any kind of logic in Sarte's later years but Gerassi, because of his close involvement with both Sartre and De Beauvior, is able to show the heart and soul of the man at work, especially in his darker years (involvement with revolutionary Maoists and loss of his sight and mental faculties, most likely due to his extensive use of drugs, ampetamines, alchohol etc in his 30s and 40s)...<br />Stil, Sartre is a writeer and thinker worth exploring, and he was one of the more interesting men of his time. If you are at all interested in learning more about this maddening intellectual of the 20th C- this is a fine place to start. Gerassi was chosen by sartre mainly because he was not an acolyte- he had his own opinions and had frequent arguments (some quite vitriolic) with J.P. A couple of which gerassi recounts.<br />The book has a lot of meat. Most don't. Let me reiterate that is written cearly and concisely- a quality MUCH LACKING in most books of this kind, and a quality that I value highly, outside of experimental fiction...

Zimmer writes with clarity and interest about the wonders of parasitic organisms- how they are a driving force in evolution, how they penetrate and manipulate their hosts, how they are not (as was thought previously) the dregs of the evolutionary process- if anything they are the engines of life. He also discusses how hosts can change against their parasites... And how parasites can change over time- for example, the mitochondria that power our cells are very similar to one of the more lethal diseases known to man, in fact, both probably evolved from the same ancestor!!!!!!!!<br />Furthermore- mammalian fetuses could be classified, possibly as parasitic organisms- they rewire the mother's blood-sugar levels and secrete chemicals that leach away the various chemicals that the fetus demands to grow... the mother tries to combat this process as an unchecked fetus could drain her and take away her capacity to make more children. But the fetus has inherited a number of enzymes from the father that attempt to latch on and break the mother's control over her own body. These and myriad other insights into biology are woven together wonderfully. I couldn't put this book down!<br />Zimmer travels the globe and his anecdotes concerning the various parasitologists are almost as much fun to read as the protracted discussions of the parasites. It is a budding field in biology and full of colorful characters. He also writes about parasites in films and pop culture, such as the Alien series... I couldn't imagine anyone else making a species like 'Sacculinae' (I know I miss-spelled that) come alive (they infest crabs, basically turning the crabs into castrated barnacle spawners). Zimmer does.<br />At times it's a horrifying read: Nature doesn't love you, but she sure coddles toxoplasma and legions of other parasitic species, whose ranks are spread across every animal kingdom. Guinea worms, Sleeping sickness, Fleischmania (eats away the flesh of your face), the Candiru, the botfly- if you have a penchant for the macabre and disgusting you will not be let down. But this book isn't just to disgust and delight readers... It's illuminating and clear- approachable in a way that very few scientific-works-for-laypeople are. I can't wait to get my hands on other books by Mr. Zimmer.

Every character is well-developed and perfectly used. The writing is deceptively simple- i'd say elegant even. The parables that Storyteller weaves throughout are worth the price of the book alone.<br />Also, it's one of those books that leave you wanting to know more.

HE IS ALSO VERY LUCID. HE WRITES CLEARLY. This is a qualaty you will not find often when perusing most high-minded 20th C. texts. He doesn't talk down to his audience and presumes a level of cultural literacy, but he steadfastly refuses to fall prey to that most insidious and seductive of academic flaws: jargon juggling.<br />He capably traces the roots of existentialism in various literary works and shows how the sensibilities expressed in exstlsm. are repeatedly expressed throughout western culture.<br />People are divided on both the subject and the book, but that is natural: par example... Students of hermenuetics and disciples of heidegger feel that Kaufmann is biased against ole Martin, or that he spends too little time on him. And devotees of Sartre feel likewise. Many think he's too kind to Nietzsche. I disagree with all of the above. I think he treats each thinker succinctly and fairly, rooting them in their context and then looking at what they had to say.<br />Existentialism. This is a word one hears often. It is Misused every day by pretentious half-wits of all variety. Here, in one clear volume, you have a fine key for the door.

In this age where intellectuals and academics seem able to justify their lives and works solely by how confusing or intimidating they are, Kaufmann's work are respite, reprieve, and sanctuary.<br />Sometimes I feel like the post-modern intellectual ferment is a  phenomenon akin to Medieval Scholasticism (how many angels can dance on the head of a pin)- the rampantly tendentious obscurantism, the impenetrable jargon and idiotic linguistic play of theoretical discourse...  If only Kaufamnn where here to call these post-modern charlatans (who all-too often pillage Kaufmann's intellectual and spiritual predecessor, Nietzsche) out on their empty sophistry... As always, I'm getting off topic.<br />This book is an exemplary work of scholarship- aproachable, insightful, clear, interesting, at times humorous, and unencumbered. It is so good and so readable it is at odds with our age. Kaufmann analyses not only the major tragedians of antiquity (Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides) but also the commentators of antiquity- Plato and Aristotle, calling them on their glaring faults and presumptions. It takes serious [courage] (or it used to) to go messing with the two Grecian heavy-weights of western thought but Kaufamnn is up to the challenge. One walks away from the first half of the book STEEPED in ideas.<br />Kaufamnn also examines Shakespearian Tragedy. Then he discusses the theories of both Nietzsche and Hegel as regards both tragedy and Greek culture in general. This, in my opinion is where Kaufmann truly shines, as a brilliant commentator on German philosophy and literature. (His book on Hegel was the first to enable me to understand Hegel, and I reccomend it whole-heartedly). He knows Nietzsche like the back of his hand and has the ability to call ol' Fritz out when he falls prey to his own style, the shrill and willful naysaying. He is highly fond of Nietzsche but is also not an acolyte (the greatest disservice one can do to a thinker as profound as Nietzsche is to be a disciple and nothing more, and Nietzsche himself never tired of stating that), Kaufmann possessed a head level enough to work through N's thought and avoid his missteps (Nietzsche, for example, points the finger at Euripides for the fall of tragedy. Kaufmann disagrees and clearly believes that the form continued on through other historical epochs, but not our own).<br />Still, despite his differences, Kaufmann finds much in both Nietzsche and Hegel that is worthwhile and illuminating, and he delivers to the reader not only a thorough comprehension of both thinker's perceptions of tragedy, but also a capacity to root both men in their historical context, so that one has a sense of WHY they thought and wrote as they did. Don't underestimate that.<br />He finally posits his own 'ironic' theory of tragedy against those of the thinkers he has perused and analysed (This is not surprising, as Kaufmann's first and highest devotion, philosophically was to the ever-ironic Socrates). He also discusses why our age has been unable live up to the art of those who have come before, and why (in his opinion) our age has produced no fully realized tragedies of its own (though a few have tried... perhaps the form and all its particulars is no longer relevant, like epic poetry- it can be studied and of course enjoyed for its sublime nature, but to attempt to create one would be a farsical endeavor??? I'm just wondering aloud so to speak...) He briefly looks at Sartre's 'The Flies,' in connection with Euripides and doesn't fault JP too much. I'm very fond of that play and my copy of the book is underlined almost the whole way through on this chapter.<br />I can't think of any other text on tragedy (or even drama in general) that does so much for the reader. Why can't all writers and scholars be this concise, enthralling and well-learned?<br />I'll end by repeating: the finest book on tragedy and thought I have come across.er as profound as Nietzsche is to be a disciple and nothing more, and Nietzsche himself never tired of stating that), Kaufmann possessed a head level enough to work through N's thought and avoid his missteps (Nietzsche, for example, points the finger at Euripides for the fall of tragedy.

Simply put, it is one of the most over-looked, classic texts of the 20th C. Platonov writes in a style that combines a dreamy, surreal sensibility of the world with a hard, trenchant, unflinching look at the characters who inhabit it. My copy of this is dog-eared, full of notes and underlines- aspiring writers take note- Platonov is a writer who is to be studied, as much for his subtlety and lyrical elegance as his tough-skinned presentation of ruined lives; people trying to craft some order and peace from a world, and largely doomed to fail.<br />I'm being a bit too romantic, too hyperbolic. I probably shouldn't have attempted this. But I want to put my two cents in as concerns this work, because I love it. It is a marvelous book.	2003-06-19
