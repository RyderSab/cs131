I thought this would be an adventure story along the lines of Romancing The Stone. Boy was I wrong. To Love A Man is just a modern day bodice ripper with some pretty bad writing. Not once during the story did I care what happened to Lisa or Sam because they were both so unbelievable and I cannot imagine how any writer could use someone like Sam for the hero. In most stories, he would be the villain in which the hero would rescue the heroine from. This said, I have no problem with an author writing about a not so hero-like alpha male like Linda Howard's After The Night, Mary Jo Putney's Burning Point or Karen Ranney's Upon A Wicked Time. But show me, in some way, that this guy has something worth loving. We don't get this with Sam. He is cruel and nasty throughout the whole story and not only that but he is a rapist. I can't imagine any woman wanting him, but Lisa is pretty unbelievable too. For those of you who think you are getting an adventure romance, I have to warn you that you will also be getting some bad writing too.	2003-09-24

For the next three years, he uses his newspaper to keep the story alive and find the truth of what really happened the night William Neville disappeared. After a chance meeting with Sara herself, Max is angry at himself for being very attracted to a woman he believes is a murdering slut. Despite his feelings, Sara is apparently in some serious trouble and he is determined to help her whether she wants it or not. Sara's feelings for Max are just as jumbled. She hates him for the condemnation he has subjected her to in his newspaper, but is also mutually attracted to him. However, someone wants her dead and Max isn't giving her a choice in his protection so she grudgingly accepts his help. Together, they come up with a plan to draw out her enemy but the closer they get to the truth, the more desperate he becomes and the more danger they are in.<br />Strangers At Dawn is a definite page-turner with great characters. The two leads are strong people who are very likable. I wasn't sure if I would like Max at first. He comes off in the beginning as very judgmental and harsh, but he develops into a great hero and he is able to own up to his mistakes and apologize. And don't we all secretly want someone like Max who is determined to protect and defend us? Sara is also a very lovable heroine. She's strong, caring and mature. She's had a very hard life, but she doesn't let it warp her. This is my first story by Elizabeth Thornton and I was very impressed. I'll have to read more of her work.	2003-08-04
US	51930495	R92LKVSEDFS97	0440222575	212727617	The Last Arrow	Books	5	10	10	N	N	One of my favorite stories of all time	When she captures a trespasser on her father's lands, Lady Brenna Wardieu knows that Griffyn Renaud cannot be trusted despite the fact that he turns out to be an acquaintance of her brother, Robin. And she is right. Griffyn has been hired to challenge Robin in an upcoming tournament and kill him. His only obstacle is Brenna who is determined to find out the truth about him. He is also very attracted to the Lady Brenna and it's becoming harder and harder to go about destroying her brother. There is a lot more to this story, but it's too complicated to go into without ruining the story.<br />The Last Arrow is an engrossing read that keeps you guessing until the end. Not only is there a great romantic conflict, but there is also a lot of action, a truly evil villain and some great secondary characters. While The Last Arrow can stand on it's own, I really recommend that you read it in context with the series: Through A Dark Mist, In The Shadow Of Midnight, and The Last Arrow. If you like Medeival Romance, I can't recommend these stories enough.	2003-08-03

I seem to be in the minority here because I found Beyond The Highland Mist to be a very tedious read.<br />After a very traumatic fallout with the man she thought she would marry, Adrienne de Simone swears to have nothing to do with beautiful men when she suddenly finds herself catapulted from her Seattle home into 16th century Scotland where she is forced to marry Laird Hawk Douglas. Hawk is everything she doesn't want in a man: he is absolutely gorgeous and pretty arrogant and she is determined to have nothing to do with him. <br />I'll start with the first aspect of this story I disliked. I had to read over two hundred pages of Hawk trying to get to know his wife and her just being incredibly nasty to him because she doesn't trust beautiful men. Nothing else goes on, and by the time they start falling in love I just didn't care anymore. The second thing that ruined the story for me was Adrienne herself. She is supposed to be this intelligent modern woman, and she acted like a nasty, petty, mean little girl. It was beyond me what Hawk saw in her, and towards the end I didn't have a lot of respect for him either.<br />This author is highly rated so I will give her another try. I just hope Kiss Of The Highlander is better.	2003-07-07
US	51930495	R1EUGYA2GW3XOR	0440206111	503791357	Through a Dark Mist	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Totally Enthralling	I read Through a Dark Mist a while back, and it hooked me from page one. I could not put it down long enough to get anything done, and I finished it in one day. I have read just about all of Marsha Canham's stories, and you can't go wrong with her. She always guarantees a good plot, a steamy romance and good characters. <br />During the reign of the greedy King John, Lady Servanne de Briscourt is on her way to meet with her betrothed Lucien Wardieu when her party is attacked by the notorious Black Wolf and his gang of thieves. What follows is a wildly exciting story that just sucks you right into it from page one. Canham does an excellent job of balancing the story with the romance so that you don't feel you are being cheated out of either, and she gives good description of what it was like for the lower classes of England during the reign of King John and the injustices that took place.<br />I really can't recommend this book enough. If you like medeival romance, this is the book for you.	2003-05-07

Great Story	For those who read Through A Dark Mist, you know that the Black Wolf discovers that he has an illegitimate son named Eduard. Well this is his story, and while I thought this story wouldn't be as good as its prequel, I was wrong. In the Shadow Of Midnight is a great sequel and a must for Canham fans.<br />Lady Ariel de Clare is appalled that King John plans on forcing her to marry one of his repulsive guards. She flees England with her Brother, Henry, to Brittany to seek the help of her uncle, the marshall of England. The resolution her uncle decides on finds Ariel escorted in disguise to Wales by Eduard FitzRandwulf. What Ariel doesn't know is that her journey to Wales is really a smokescreen for the real mission Eduard is planning which is to rescue Princess Eleanor of Brittany who has been taken prisoner by King John. <br />Sparks fly between Eduard and Ariel. They are both tempermental and stubborn, and neither wants to be in the other's company but traveling for days in dangerous conditions brings them closer together and makes it harder for them to deny the attraction developing between them. <br />I think some people need to beware: this story is more centered around the plot than the romance which is finding out what King John did to his neice, Princess Eleanor. I did not mind this because the book is so filled with adventure and cliffhanging moments that it was kind of nice to read a book that's not all about the romance.<br />All in all, this is a great story for anyone. Even those who don't like romance novels.	2003-05-07

I know that women were only good for the property they could bring in a marriage and had no power, but I don't want to read a story where the hero is determined to hurt, humiliate and degrade the heroine just to prove that he is in control and not feeling anything for her. She is his prisoner and he degrades her in front of her people constantly, makes her a kitchen servant to perform the most backbreaking work, then makes her his leman against her will. He doesn't change until the last ten pages of the story. Women were not always treated nice, and i'm sure this sorta thing happened but for heavens sake don't label this romance. This is not love, it's about a bitter man who is so intent on hurting and humiliating the woman he supposedly loves I wasn't convinced he really did come to love her. This just wasn't for me. When I read a romance book, I want to read about romance.	2002-12-24

Marian Edwards takes an overdone plot and does nothing to make it original or interesting. It's a plot that's been done a thousand times: Norman Conqueror arrives to claim confiscated lands awarded to him, he's attracted to the former lady of the house and makes her his leman, forces her to share his bed, she fights at first but submits to his stronger will, they end up getting married and the conqueror becomes conquered by love. This is basically all there is to Hearts Victorious. I didn't like the characters or the story. Royce and Bethany did nothing for me, but while Bethany I just didn't care for, Royce I detested. He is nasty and cruel in both actions and character. He forces Bethany to become his mistress, when his fiance arrives and throws a fit he throws her to the tower, when the king forces him to marry Bethany he throws a fit at having to marry what he calls a peasant girl and swears he will make her life miserable. This is the hero? ... Some readers may love this story and I respect that, but it just wasn't for me. I won't be reading anything else by her.	2002-12-22

I'm so glad I kept with it, because this is one of the best stories I have ever read. Brenda Joyce creates a fascinating story set in the time of the William The Conqueror.<br />Ceidre, the illegitimate daughter of the lord of Castle Aelfgar, has lived her whole life as an outsider in her village because of a physical deficiency (a wandering left eye that is called the evil eye) that caused people to brand her a witch. When Rolfe rides in to claim her brother's lands and marry her sister, she is determined to hate this man. But Rolfe is not what she expected. She is attracted to him and amazed that he does not fear her or believe her a witch. He protects her from her sister's hatred and proves himself a fair and honorable man.<br />Some people may not like Rolfe and be offended by some of the things he does. Joyce accurately portrays him as a medeival man. He treats his serfs like property to do with as he sees fit, he doesn't tolerate defiance or his word being questioned, he is a deadly warrior and Joyce doesn't gloss over some of the things he does when dealing with Saxon rebels. But for all this, he has a sense of fairness and honor. Not many authors can create a medeival character who is believable and likeable at the same time, but Brenda Joyce manages this beautifully with Rolfe. Also, the things he does to protect Ceidre, even at the cost of himself and what he has worked so hard for, are what romance is all about. This is a man who will sacrifice all for the woman he loves, and these actions speak louder than any thoughts or words.<br />I really liked Ceidre also. She is a strong woman who has had a hard life. This is no typical heroine who fights the hero at first but then surrenders to his stronger will. Her will is just as strong as Rolfe's and they butt heads many times throught the story. <br />All in all, this was a wonderful story with everything you could want in a romance. Some may find it violent, but it didn't offend me and I am definitely one of those sensitive readers. So give it a chance cause this was a fabulous read.	2002-12-22

But Bertrice Small makes it work with her great writing style and attention to detail. She does a fabulous job of describing the life and customs of the muslim culture that I felt like I was right there. She does a good job of balancing the history and way of life back then with the romance. The Love Slave is definitely intended as a sort of erotic romance, but Small skillfully weaves a story with these scenes. I hate when authors get so wrapped up in writing sex scenes that they forget that they actually need to write some kind of story also.<br />The only problem I had with The Love Slave is some of the descriptive words used when writing some of the love scenes. Words like \\"love pillar,\\" \\"mound of venus,\\" and \\"love juices\\" are unnecessary and ruin the erotic moment they are supposed to be.<br />Other than that, this was a great book. It's my first story by Bertrice Small, and I intend to read more by her.	2002-10-14

You don't read that many romances with a 29 year old woman and a 40+ male. Beatrice is one of my favorite Quick heroines. She is no young, naive girl. She's strong, confident, stubborn, practical and intelligent. Leo is also one of my favorites. He is a recluse with no use for society, but Beatrice drags him out of his self-imposed seclusion and takes him on a wild ride that changes his life. <br />There was nothing dull about With This Ring. It takes off from the first page and doesn't drag. Beatrice and Leo are both strong characters, and I got a few good laughs reading about them locking horns. They also both deserve happiness and it was great to read about how they find it with each other. If you are a fan of Amanda Quick, you should definitely read this one.	2002-09-24

Well in the Marriage Lesson, Richard and Gillian are married and inspecting land in America they inherited from their marriage. They have left Richard's three younger sisters in the care of Thomas while they are gone. Thomas wants them married and off his hands as soon as possible, but the oldest sister, Marianne, will not make it easy for him. She has no desire to get married, but wants to be independent and have adventures. Unfortunately for Thomas, part of her planned adventures involves experiencing intimacy and Thomas is the one she wants to experience it with.<br />One problem I had with this story was the repetition of ideas. Okay Marianne, we get that you want to be independent and have adventures!<br />Another problem I had was with Marianne herself. She is described as this intelligent woman, but she doesn't show it a lot. She wants to experience intimacy, and doesn't care about her reputation because she has no plans to marry. Didn't anyone explain to her that if she and Thomas were found out, no one would want to have anything to do with her? That not only would she be completely ostracised, but that she would hurt her sisters' marriage prospects, turn Thomas into a known seducer of innocents, and embarass her brother and sister-in-law? I guess not because it never occurs to her.<br />Not to say that I didn't like The Marriage Lesson, but The Husband List was much better. I have heard Alexander called the next Julia Quinn, but I like Quinn's style of writing much better. But despite some flaws, The Marriage Lesson is a cute story and you should give it a chance and see what you think.	2002-09-23

I also find it truly offensive when the hero later hits her across the face hard when his sister took offense at something she said. There is nothing at all romantic in a story with a hero who is nothing more than a violent, mean-spirited man who will use his strength to hurt a woman half his size. The heroine acts like a spoiled brat almost from the moment the story starts, but you have to feel sympathy for her because she certainly didn't deserve what she got. I wouldn't wish a man like this on my worst enemy.<br />This is the second story I have read by Johanna Lindsay, and I can honestly say she just isn't for me. I don't like her violent, rapist heroes. It was all I could do to finish Paradise Wild, and when I was done I mostly felt sorry for the heroine. She ends up with a man who might backhand her again if she makes him angry. Some people liked this story, and I respect others opinions but I will not be reading anything else by this author.	2002-09-23

She asks her two best friends, Robin and Kit to make her a list of suitable husbands. Number one is the honorable Richard Shelton, Earl of Shelbrooke. Not being one to beat around the bush, Gillian outright proposes to him and offers him half her inheritance in exchange for a marriage of convenience where they both have separate lives. <br />Richard really needs the money the marriage will bring to him. His father gambled away the whole family fortune, and he has an estate and four sisters to take care of. But he also wants heirs and a wife to share his life with, so he is reluctant to enter into this marriage. What follows is a very engaging courtship where both Richard and Gillian get to know one another and fall in love. <br />I liked that both the characters are blunt with each other regarding their feelings, and there are no misunderstandings or games hampering the story. The secondary characters are also funny and endearing without dominating the story. The Husband List is a must for those who like their regencies to have some comedy to them.	2002-09-23

One Of My Favorite Medeival Romances	Mystique opens up with a mass of chaos in the Lady Alice's home. There is an impending visit from Hugh The Relentless laying claim to a mysterious stone that Alice purchased (and lost) and everyone is terrified that the notorious warrior will attack their home if angered. But unknown to everyone, Alice has no intention of bowing down to Hugh The Relentless. She intends to strike a bargain with him in exchange for the stone.<br />Hugh is used to fear and respect from people, and Alice shocks him when she publicly chastises him for his rudeness and offers to help him find the missing stone in exchange for money for her brother's schooling and her entry into a convent. He is also surprised to find himself very attracted to her. But he doesn't fight it, and does everything he can to make sure she becomes his wife. <br />I really enjoyed Mystique. I like a hero who respects his wife's intelligence and courage. I also like a heroine who is strong and stubborn without being childish and dumb. This is a great story about two stubborn people who are perfect for each other. They are both characters you can relate to, and their story is a delight. If you feel as I do, you should also read Rendevous and Ravished by this author. Both are just as good.	2002-09-09

It seemed like this author was so wrapped up in writing the sex scenes that she suddenly remembered that she needed some sort of plot. <br />While her hero, Fawkes, was more likeable and human, her heroine did nothing for me and her behavior was silly from start to finish. She has this great guy who has dreamed of rescuing her from her brutal husband and giving her a good life for years, and she repays him by betraying him and lying to him continuously.<br />Another problem I had with this story was a lot of the dialogue. I know for a fact that the four letter \\"F\\" word did not exist in England during the 1100's, and it is used excessively here. Also, Donovan has a habit of repeating a lot of words. One reviewer said that she uses the word Quim a lot and I totally agree. I got so tired of reading phrases like, \\"Her throbbing quim,\\" or \\"Her wet quim.\\" Instead of the sexy scene it was intended to be, I was laughing.<br />All in all, No Surrender did not hold my interest. It might not have been so bad if it was labeled erotica, but when I read a romance novel, I want to read about romance.	2002-09-08

Jo and Damien are realistic characters that are easy to relate to and the story just sucks you right in from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the end. <br />Monk takes you back in time to the American Revolution, and does such a good job of it that you feel like you are right there with the characters. She vividly portrays two people on opposite sides of the war who fall in love and end up in the position where they will sacrifice their lives and cause to save one another. Just be warned: this is written during the time of The American Revolution and many battle scenes are described in the gruesome reality in which they took place. There are scenes describing the aftermath of battles where many young men lose their lives and these scenes are not glossed over, but very tragic.<br />This is a story for everyone, even people who do not like romance novels.

It startes out interesting enough but nosedives from there. While the hero, Fawkes, is a likeable character, Nicola did absolutely nothing for me and her behavior is silly from start to finish. She has a great guy who worships her and saves her from her brutal husband, and she pays him back by lying to him consistently throughout the story and hiding his child from him. Her reasoning for doing this was ridiculous and very contradictory to the strong, intelligent woman that she is described as.<br />Another thing I didn't like about No Surrender were the endless sex scenes that must have taken up about a third of the story. I didn't find them the least bit sexy, but crude. There is no intimacy or sharing, just a lot of rough sex. And when they aren't having sex they are talking about having sex or thinking about having sex. There is no desire to just be with one another, just sex. Lisa Kleypas's latest book, \\"Lady Sophia's Lover,\\" was blasted for this but it was a lot more tasteful and romantic than this.<br />And a lot of crude terms used to describe sexual encounters were not used in this time period...Also, the hero and his knights did not sound like men from the medeival period, but like modern sex-crazed young men.<br />By the time I was reaching the end of No Surrender, I really didn't care what happened to Fawkes and Nicola. For those who felt the same way, I would to and buy a story by Tina St. John or Shana Abe. They write medeival romance and do a good job of it.	2002-09-01

After reading some mixed reviews, I wasn't sure about this latest from Kleypas, but I wasn't disappointed. Lady Sophia's Lover is a beautiful story with lovable characters, and a wonderful romance.<br />After her brother dies in prison, Sophia is devastated. She is determined to get revenge on the magistrate who sent him to prison in the first place: Sir Ross Cannon. She gets a job as his assistant with the intention of ruining him. However, as she gets to know him, she discovers that Ross is a kind, caring person who has an inate sense of fairness that is conflicting with what she had thought. There is a growing attraction between the two along with a mutual respect. They both have their own demons to battle, and they need each other to conquer them.<br />I liked Sophia. She has had a difficult life and has every reason to want revenge but as she gets to know Ross, she sees that he is a compassionate, fair man with a deep sense of honor. She is not so bitter that she cannot see that he wouldn't wrongfully send someone to prison. She is able to question what she first believed to be true, and see that there could be a different side. And I just loved Ross. He is just a great guy. He is not an aristocrat but a self-made man who has worked very hard to get where he is, and he acts with honor and dignity in his job and life. He puts impossible standards on himself, and he needs Sophia to make him realize that he is just a man, and not superhuman.<br />Lisa Kleypas always writes a beautiful love story, and this one is no exception. I absolutely loved it.	2002-08-06

Olivia is a great heroine. Smart, sarcastic and dedicated to her family. Jasper is one of the most endearing heroes I have read about. An all-around nice guy with some quirks to his character that make him very human to me. He is very neat and methodical, and he doesn't relate to Olivia's disorganized unmethodical tendencies. It was great reading about these two clashing, then working together to uncover a blackmailer, and realizing they are in love. I loved this story and must have read it at least ten times.

Nell has dreams of reorganizing the business, and Gabe wants everything just like it is. Throw in an old murder to solve, and two friends trying to get away from controlling partners and it makes for an interesting read.<br />My biggest problem with Fast Women was that I didn't like Gabe or Nell and liking the two main characters is the most important thing when reading a story. I thought Gabe was very one-dimensional, and I thought Nell was a bitter, controlling, manipulative woman. She gets a job as Gabe's secretary, and gets angry when he doesn't want her changing his business around. This is a very large problem with these two that gets worse and worse, but never really gets resolved. When I finished this story, my big feeling was that when the good sex started to fizzle they would be in trouble.<br />My other problem was with the secondary characters. I think they took up way too much of the story, and there was really no point for them being that big a part of the plot. But all in all, it is not a bad read. But Crusie has written much better. Manhunting and Welcome To Temptation are much better.	2002-07-27

Penelope is kind of plain and awkward, and she has largely been either ignored or made fun of at balls. But underneath the shyness, Penelope is intelligent, funny and kind and Colin begins to see these traits years later when he returns from his travels. Slowly he feels more and more drawn to her and Quinn does a great job of developing this change. <br />I really liked Penelope's character. She is not this perfect heroine that many authors try to create. She is passable attractive at best and shy. Only people she knows well know the real Penelope who has a sharp wit and good sense of humor. I also liked Colin. He is a genuinely good person, and when he realizes how he feels about Penelope, he becomes her biggest champion. He is protective, possessive and loving. <br />I would recommend this story to anyone, but I would also suggest reading the first three stories of the Bridgerton series to get more background information.	2002-07-10

After finding out that her ex-fiance has posted her naked pictures on the internet, underwear model turned designer Lola Carlyle needs a vacation to escape the stress and embarassment. So she goes to the Bahamas with her dog, Baby Doll, and while she is sleeping on a friend's yacht it is comandeered by government agent, Max Zamora.<br />After reading all the negative reviews, I almost didn't read this one but i'm glad I did. I did not think the heroine was stupid, and I did not think it at all unrealistic to freak out over some naked photos of her on the web. Those are pictures that someone she trusted took and she did not think they would become public. Underwear modeling is a little different than pictures becoming public that you absolutely did not want people to see. I thought Lola was a hilarious character with a quirkiness that makes her different from most heroines you read about.<br />Lola Carlyle Reveals All is a funny, light-hearted romance that is right up there with all of this author's other books.	2002-04-25

He ships her off to Cuba for an arranged marriage. Her ship is attacked on her way and she finds herself the prisoner of Captain Morgan Scott. She puts on her nun habit hoping he will have moral issues with forcing himself on a nun. When Morgan meets Luca he is powerfully attracted to her. He does not believe she is a nun, and he is determined to find the truth and make her want him like he wants her. There were things I liked and disliked about this book, so I decided on three stars.<br />~I liked the fact that the book takes right off from the beginning, and the story moves forward without lagging. I finished this story in an afternoon, and could not stop until I was done. I had to know what would happen next. There's lots of action.<br />~I disliked the fact that the characters were flat and pretty two-dimensional, and the style of writing is very simplistic. The hero hates everything Spanish, because he was made a slave on a Spanish ship. Although he is strongly attracted to Luca, he cannot get over the fact that she is Spanish. Most of the story deals with Morgan trying to accept Luca despite her spanish heritage. This got tedious in the extreme. This woman had absolutely nothing to do with what had happened to him and it seemed like he blames her for the sins of a Spanish Crew. <br />Taken By You is an entertaining read. I would recommend picking it up and giving it a try.	2002-04-06

What a mistake. Taking the viking period into account, I expect detailed battle scenes, rough around the edges heroes, explosive battle of wills between the hero and heroine, maybe forced seduction. I draw the line at rape. <br />This story does have a number of rape scenes that I found repulsive. The rape scene is described in a way that is absolutely unforgiveable. The hero hurts the heroine physically and emotionally, and feels no remorse. In fact, he commits rape on the heroine in anger with the express purpose of hurting her. I understand, this story takes place a long time ago where this was totally acceptable and commonplace. Doesn't wash with me. This action shows the hero to be brutal and vicious man, who will inflict physical and emotional pain on the heroine whenever he is angry with her. <br />Well, the rape scenes aside, Fires Of Winter just did not draw me into the story. I thought the characters were one dimensional, the plot non-existent, and the romance disturbing. Fires Of Winter does not even compare to Heather Graham's Golden Surrender. I will try another of this author's stories, but I am not taking another chance on her viking trilogy.	2002-02-14

So she goes in search for the famous Black Wolf, Malcolm MacFane, who is said to be unbeatable in battle. When she finds the Black Wolf, she is dismayed to find a drunken shell of the famous warrior. Although disappointed, she decides he still can help train her people in fighting and defense.<br />This a great story of a broken hero mending himself with some help from the heroine. This is not your typical mighty warrior romance story. Malcolm is damaged both physically and emotionally. He suffered a crippling injury on the battlefield that has caused him continous back and leg pain. He also made a mistake years ago that caused him to be cast out by his clan. So he has been living in seclusion drinking away his physical and emotional pain. Ariella offers enough money for him to train her people and as he starts to succeed in making warriors out of a bunch of artists and craftsmen, he starts to get some of his sense of self worth back.<br />Ariella is a little frustrating at first. She is very strong and resourceful, but she is not a good judge of character. She thinks her future husband should be a mighty warrior strong and brave and Malcolm does not fit her version of her perfect warrior. But what makes this story good is that hero and heroine have very human faults. Malcolm starts to mend both physically and emotionally, and Ariella realizes that strength comes from the inside of a person.<br />All in all, a very well written and original story.	2002-01-27

Kleypas does what she does in all of her stories. She creates an original story and she makes her characters three dimensional with flaws and vulnerabilities. <br />The heroine, Amanda, is a successful writer and an independent woman but she is also lonely. Prepared to live out her life alone, she wants one memory of intimacy. Unfortunately, her \\"courtesan\\" turns out to be famous publisher, Jack Devlin. Jack is instantly attracted to Amanda, and when he finds out that she's waiting for a hired male he is more than willing to play the part, but Amanda has a change of heart and sends him away.<br />When Amanda finds out that her courtesan was really the famous Jack Devlin, she is furious. However, she is attracted to him as well. This is a great story, and Kleypas does a good job of combining mounting sexual tension between the hero and heroine with a growing friendship. I also liked hearing about the literary society. Where most regency romances are all about the Ton, this story goes away from that to the literary and art society.<br />This was a great read. Not boring for a second and well written. If you like Kleypas's stories, you will like this one.	2002-01-27

I loved the other two stories in this series. The Valentine Legacy was a favorite of mine. This was such a horrible story, I had a hard time finishing.<br />The hero is the most horrible, petty, controlling, abusive ...I have read about in a long time. He spends almost the whole story saying the meanest things to the heroine. For example, he calls her a \\"stupid cow\\" when he is angry. Sorry, verbal and emotional abuse do not pass for romantic conflict with me.<br />The heroine takes this treatment in silence until the hero goes too far, and she explodes in violence. So romantic huh?	2002-01-22

Although he cares about Lucien, he wants his future heirs to be of his blood so he comes up with an idea. Lucien will marry his newly discovered illegitimate daughter, Beth Armitage, to preserve the lineage. so he breaks the news to Lucien that he is not really his father, and tells him what he wants him to do. <br />Beth Armitage is happy in her life as a school teacher. She is independent and free to do as she pleases. One day, the Duke of Belcraven comes to see her, tells her he is really her father, announces she will marry his son or he will put the school where she works out of business.<br />These two are very much forced into a marriage neither of them wants, and they say and do some hurtful things to each other until they both realize that they can't avoid this marriage and declare a truce. Beverly does a great job of letting the reader see the point of view of both Lucien and Beth, and what causes them to do what they do. And although there is alot of fighting and insults, they are done with wit and intelligence. I hate romances where all the hero and heroine do is call each other petty names between bouts of rough sex. These two make peace with each other, become friends and realize they care deeply about each other before they get intimate. All in all, a very well written, entertaining story.	2002-01-19

He will imprison the heroine, touch her body at will ignoring her protests, using her as a pawn in his plans for revenge and the hell with who he hurts in the process. <br />Second, we have a heroine who is described as having a strong will but we rarely see it. Anytime she tries to stand up to the hero, she melts from his scorching kisses. I just hate authors who use this whole scenerio. It's kind of insulting to our sex. If a guy has taken you prisoner in his home, stolen a family heirloom from you, and informed you that he was going to get revenge on your father by making you his concubine, would your resistance against him disappear once he kissed you? <br />Last of all, I just did not see what deep feelings they had for each other at the end of the story. When I read a story by Lisa Kleypas, Mary Jo Putney, Karen Monk or Jo Beverly, I have no doubt in my mind that the hero and heroine genuinely love each other. When this story ended, I mostly felt sorry for the heroine. Whatever assertiveness she has will eventually be crushed by the hero.	2002-01-07

Guy does not trust Katherine and drags her off to his ancestral home instead of leaving her where she is. This did not make any sense and all it did was tear her apart from her tramautized sister. Once they reach their destination, all they do is fight. Guy finds she lied about being pregnant, a lie her sister told hoping it would convince him to leave her sister there, and he rapes her. I just hate stories where the hero rapes the heroine in anger. <br />I thought Guy was a mean, abusive (...), and I thought Katherine was an empty headed female who only knew how to hurl insults. She makes several attempts at escape but makes no clear plan at how to go through with it. She pretty much takes off on foot through dense wilderness where the hero finds her right away. I just hate it when romance authors use immaturity as feminine strength of mind. Well, needless to say, this is the last story I will be reading by this author.	2001-12-09

One of them has to marry well or them and their mother will have to move to the country in genteel poverty. It is assumed that younger sister Edwina will make the good match because she very beautiful. One of her suitors turns out to be Anthony Bridgerton from Quinn's previous story, The Duke And I.<br />Anthony has decided it's time to settle down with a wife and have children. He's not looking for love, just a woman who is attractive and intelligent. He decides to make his search short by asking his brothers who the Season's Incomparable(which happens to be Edwina) is and courting her.<br />Kate has heard of Anthony's reputation as a womanizer, and she does not want her little sister near him. Being the straightforward person she is, she tells Anthony to his face. Anthony is not accustomed to anyone telling him what to do, so Kate's demand makes him more determined to court her sister even though Kate is the one he is feeling a growing attraction for. So they go into a battle of wills that is guaranteed to make anyone laugh. <br />The interactions between Kate and Anthony are well done as they go from spitting nails at each other, to laughing together, to a truce and finally to gradual intimacy. The secondary characters also contribute to make a lighthearted, hilarious story.	2001-12-04

I like Elizabeth Lowell okay but this story is not one her best. Untamed is set in medeival time. The hero has been awarded a wealthy heiress with a profitable estate in marriage. When he marries her, he proceeds to spend the rest of the story concerned with getting a male heir that is of his blood. He locks his wife in her room for a period of time, then has her followed for the rest of the story until she is pregnant. She has given him absolutely no reason at all for him to believe she has slept around, and I just could not stand to read about the heroine being imprisoned and followed around until she became pregnant. Lowell's other two stories in this trilogy(Forbidden and Enchanted) are good but this one became boring fast.	2001-12-02

He has really changed in this story. His years of travel have given him an inner strength and peace he didn't have in The Wild Child. What I really like about Kyle is that he appreciates and respects other cultures and customs. The China Bride finds him in the outskirts of China where he is determined to get in the country and worship at the temple of hoshan. The problem? Foreigners are not allowed in China. This is where the heroine comes in.<br />Troth Montgomery is half Chinese/half Scottish. The death of her parents has forced her to disguise herself as a man and be an interpreter. Her boss is doing business with Kyle, and he sees through her disguise right away. She offers to take Kyle to the temple of hoshan if Kyle will take her to England. This is where the journey begins.<br />My one big complaint about this story is that these two could have avoided much if they had communicated better. This story started out really good with the journey through china to the temple of hoshan. It kind of fizzles out when Kyle returns to England. But it is still a story worth reading.	2001-11-17

I agree with the other reviews. It is very nice to read about a tormented hero who does not inflict his misery on others, or wallow in his own self pity. <br />It is such a refreshing change to read about two people who help each other overcome their dark past. The hero needs to come to terms with his dark memories of spying for England during the war with France. The heroine is mourning the loss of her father. <br />Mary Jo Putney has created a very touching story, that has a combination of humor and some serious emotional scenes. This is the first book i've ever read by this author. I am now starting on Shattered Rainbows which i've heard is just as good.	2001-11-05

This author takes a very overdone storyline and makes it into a very touching romance. I do not want to give the story away, but I will say what I liked. I liked the fact although the hero is out to get revenge on the heroine's brother for a past betrayal, he does not make the heroine pay for her brother's deeds. I also liked the fact that they like more about each other than physical appearance. <br />All in all, a very well done story.	2001-10-31

They are always described as being innocent, illogical, gentle and having tender feelings. The Bride is no exception. Julie Garwood needs to work on her characters because there is a big difference between being innocent and being dumb. Every time the heroine said something stupid or something that didn't make sense, the hero would say, &quot;You're such an innocent.&quot; <br />The heroes are all described as being gruff. It seems like everything the hero says is said &quot;gruffly&quot; and with a scowl on his face. It seems like he's not doing much else besides scowling, saying things gruffly, and giving out curt orders throughout the whole story.<br />I gave The Bride three stars because the story is entertaining and funny. For Julie Garwood fans who love her work, you will like this one. It is very typical Julie Garwood.	2001-10-31

It makes most other romance characters pale in comparison to Emma and Nikolas. I also don't usually like the past life/reincarnation story, but Lisa Kleypas pulled it off wonderfully. <br />Some complained that Nikolas is cruel, and this is partly true but Kleypas also gives you a glimpse into the unresolved abuses and horrors Nikolas experienced and she shows you how it has affected him as a person. He is so bitter and miserable, and he does not know how to cope with his past experiences. When something happens to Nikolas, sending him into his past life, he gets a chance to come to terms with his past and see what he is missing by letting it rule his life.<br />Emma is an awesome heroine. She is not like other women of her station. She is close to six feet tall and has different hobbies then most ladies like caring for animals. She stands up to Nikolas's cruelty and bitterness, and does not let him bully her.<br />I just loved this story, it is so different from your average romance.	2001-10-30

Let me just I say that I like reading a romance with a battle of wills going on between the hero and heroine. It spices up the story and makes you want to keep reading. Nicole Jordan's THE WARRIOR goes beyond this to cruelty and abuse.<br />The &quot;hero&quot; is given ownership of the heroine's home when her father is accused of being a traitor to the crown. He does not trust noblewomen because of past experiences, and proceeds to make the heroine pay for what he has suffered at the hands of noblewomen. <br />Now when I read a romance novel, I like a certain element of intimacy and sharing between the hero and heroine. Not so in this book. What intimacy there was wasn't about sharing or need. It was about conquest and humiliation on the hero's part. He degrades the heroine throughout the story by stripping her of the title &quot;lady&quot; calling her wench or leman instead, then forcing her to become his leman. The &quot;I Love You&quot; scene at the end just didn't convince me. He treated her so horribly throughout the story I didn't see how he could have possibly felt any love for her. And I really do not understand how the heroine could fall in love with someone who degraded and humiliated like he did. <br />All in all, I cannot believe that a twentieth century woman wrote this and labeled it romance. It just kills me.	2001-10-26

She has written some novels that I love like Branded Hearts, No Other Love, and Seize The Dawn. <br />Unfortunately she has written some very disturbing stories with this tame and conquer theme that I do not like at all like The Kings Pleasure, Conquer the Night, and Lie Down In Roses. The hero and heroine are on opposite sides of a nationwide battle. The heroine ends up either imprisoned by the hero or forced to marry him, while she is still true to her cause. The hero uses rape as one of his methods of discipline, and he always ruthlessly imposes his will on the heroine for the duration of the story. The heroine ends up falling in love with the hero despite his treatment of her. <br />Unfortunately, Princess of Fire falls into this category. I simply do not like reading about the hero ripping the heroines clothes off and tieing her to his bed, or locking her up. I understand that the heroine was in danger from the new king if she caused trouble, but the hero was pretty brutal and degrading to the heroine for me to stand. I gave this story three stars because it is well written and the historical details are well researched.	2001-10-18

The heroine, Genevive, is a very likeable character. She sticks to her principles and always stays true to herself despite the hard time polite society gives her. Not only that but she is just a nice person who will help anyone in trouble. The hero learns a great deal from the heroine and changes from the arrogant aristocrat to a loving husband who falls equally in love with the heroine's band of orphans. <br />I just loved this story because the hero and heroine have had such a hard time, you want to see them together. The romance is gradual and not based solely on physical appearance or physical attraction. Karyn Monk fans will not be disappointed with this one.	2001-10-17

This story takes place around the year 1066, the time of the invasion of England by William of Normandy.<br />The hero is half Norman, half Saxon and he identifies with both the conquering side and the conquered side. You can see the struggle in him as he tries to figure out which side he is on. So he disguises himself, and travels from village to village to give his saxon people any help he can. The heroine is a Norman Heiress who the hero is forced to marry. It is a marriage he does not want, because he believes the heroine is cruel and vicious to his people(Saxons) and he does not trust her. The heroine does not trust her new husband because she believes he is committing treason against the new king by planning a saxon uprising. Eventually, they learn to trust each other and realize they are in love.<br />Lord Of My Heart is a well written story that is original in its plot. Jo Beverly has once again created a story that is well researched and plotted out. For those who have read and liked this story, try one of Jo Beverly's other medeival romances. Dark Champion is another good one.	2001-10-17

The hero is pigheaded and chauvinistic, but in an endearing lovable way. The heroine is very typical of Christina Dodd's heroines. Intelligent, stubborn, practical and strong. <br />After being thrown from her home with her two children thanks to her deceased husbands treasonous activities, Lady Edlyn makes her was as an herbalist with a convent. Her world is thrown into chaos when a man holds a knife at her throat demanding she help his injured lord. That injured lord turns out to be a childhood companion she was in love with, Hugh. She saves his life, and in return he forces marriage on her so he can take care of her and her children.<br />Edlyn is furious at him declaring her fate for her. She has reservations about him because he is a warrior living a life filled with danger, and she keeps a distance from because of this. A Knight To Remember is a wonderful story, and it accurately describes how difficult it was for women during this time in history.	2001-10-13

Lynsay Sands has managed to create an original plot, endearing hero and heroine, and good secondary characters. This is the story that got me hooked on this author.

US	51930495	RHLBRI1LDHF2M	0821754173	674811702	Unconquered	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Great Job Hannah Howell	Hannah Howell has created a wonderfully engaging medeival love story without the following elements that I hate to find in romances. First, a hero who does not try to tame or break the heroine. He likes her strong will and respects her intelligence. He also does not rape or enslave the heroine as most heroes do in these Norman/Saxon love stories. Second, a heroine who is strong and feisty while being mature, practical and intelligent at the same time. Third, secondary characters who take an active part in the story and have the reader caring about what happens to them also.<br />I cannot begin to say how much I enjoyed this story. I also liked the ending. Without giving anything away, I will just say that the hero lets his love guide him and as a result gets everything he had been after. Read and find out for yourself.	2001-09-03

While he is stewing over her infedelity, the king pays him a visit. Upon learning of his broken engagement, he commands Eric to marry his illegimate daughter, Rosalind. Eric will receive a profitable estate upon the marriage. <br />Rosalind has grown up in a small convent. She is happy among the sisters and expects to take her vows and become a nun. Her father arrives and quickly puts an end to that plan. He talks his beloved daughter into the marriage and makes her swear she will obey him always. <br />It was a cute, humorous story, but I thought Eric took his mistrust of women out on the heroine and made her a prisoner of his insecurities. He was pretty mean to her to her for more than half the story.I think forbidding her near the stables or out of the castle was bordering on cruel. Especially when working with animals was something the heroine loved doing. But the heroine reacts in a way that will guarantee to bring a chuckle out of just about anyone. So read and enjoy.	2001-08-17

Princess of Fire was a pleasant surprise. It has an engaging storyline that sucks you right into it in the beginning. <br />The story begins with a fierce battle where the king of England (Harold) is killed and his daughter, Fallon, is taken prisoner by the hero. William The Conqueror has won the battle for England. The hero was cruel to the heroine but had good reason. The new king of england was perfectly willing to make an example of Fallon by having her executed should she try to start a Saxon uprising. <br />I started losing interest towards the middle of the story. The hero, Alaric, is King William's right hand man and, although he sympathises with the saxon people wants to stop any uprisings with a firm hand to prevent the deaths of innocent people. Fallon hates all Normans because they have killed her father and are tearing apart her homeland. They are on opposite sides of the battle and fight and screech at each other for nearly the whole story. Suddenly the heroine realizes that she loves the hero and wants to be with him. I don't know where that came from since all they have done is fight and have sex. It does not make it quite believeable.<br />I would have given this three stars, but the fighting became repetitive and started to annoy me. The author should have either cut this shorter or lengthened it so their &quot;I Love You&quot; moment was more believeable.	2001-08-09

I tried taking the time setting into account while reading this absolutely awful story, but it didn't work. I just cannot believe that all Norman men in this time period would act like such abusive pigs. The heroine loses her father during this Norman-Saxon war, watches as a ton of Norman men storm her home, brutalize her mother and rape village women she has known since childhood. The hero strolls in the next day declaring himself the new lord. He knows of the horror she has gone through, he knows that she has lost her father, and he knows that she has had to watch her mother and friends get brutalized, and what does he do?! <br />He declares her his own slave, announces he is going to tame her when he receives some hostility from her, and forces her to sleep with him. Oh, and he also humiliates her by forcing her to strip for him as punishment for lying to him about her betrothed. <br />Some reviewers said how considerate the hero was for giving the heroine time(Only a handful of Days!!) to adjust herself to him before forcing himself on her. I respect others opinions, but mine was different.<br />Well, I guess I learned one thing from this story. I am never going to buy another medeival romance. This was enough.	2001-06-09

I honestly don't see how it could be classified as a romance novel. In a medieval romance, I expect to read about high-handed men. However, the hero in this story, Axton, went beyond high-handed to downright mean and brutal. He was cruel and abusive to the heroine throughout the whole story, and there were too many scenes where rape would be the best word used. <br />This just isn't my type of story. I don't like reading about heroines falling in love with brutal, verbally abusive men who treat them like they have less importance than the livestock. I don't like reading about &quot;heroes&quot; who resort to rape, or use sex to make the heroine feel cheap and dirty. I think i'll just stick to Karyn Monk and Madeline Hunter.	2001-05-18

Norman conqueror takes over castle, finds Saxon village girl he is attracted to, makes her his own personal slave, forces her to reside in his private chamber, burns her cottage, isolates her from the people she cares about, blackmails her into having sex with him, and he wonders why he's getting all this hostility from her? <br />Now where have I read this before?<br />Oh yes! Now I remember. Kathleen Woodiwiss's &quot;The Wolf and The Dove!&quot; Give or take a few plot twists, this story has the same sequence of events. Although, I have to credit Ms. Woodiwiss on the fact that she took the time to create developed characters, a hero who treats the heroine better, and an interesting romance. This author did not take the time to develop any of the characters, and she didn't even create any interesting dialogue. It always went something like this: heroine, &quot;I hate you, Norman. I hate you!&quot; hero, &quot;You will be mine! You will serve me any way it pleases me!&quot; I hated reading this the first time, I was ready to chuck this book out the window when their fights are still ending this way on page 220.<br />Sorry Ms. James. I like intelligent, well-developed characters, fighting that is not so repetitive, and heroes that do not mistreat the heroines out of misplaced jealousy and distrust.	2001-05-03

Jessie Fox becomes the ward of the Marquess of Belmore. The Marquess's son, Matthew, believes the girl is a gold digging tramp and is determined to expose her. Well he marries her instead, and treats her to countless unfound suspicions, lays the blame on her for several different things gone wrong, and treats her downright cruel sometimes. The reason? Her mother was a prostitute, so she has to have inherited her mother's wickedness. The attraction he felt for her is her fault because she is putting on a false character front to snag him thus inheriting his land and title with him. After all, her mother was a prostitute and it stands to reason that she has to be just like her.<br /> There's nothing more I hate than reading about a close minded hero who will jump to conclusions based on some convuluted logic like that. He does not realize what a jerk he has been until the last sixty pages of the story. At that point, I was not interested in how sorry he was. I was just glad I was nearing the end of the story.	2001-04-27

A rich, cold-blooded hero; a book-smart, guileless, sickening sweet heroine; and a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING. The big misunderstanding is usually a mistake on the hero's part, and he treats the heroine like dirt until he realizes he was wrong and then he tries to get the heroine back. In a nutshell, this is pretty much all there is to Until You. Except in previous stories there is more interaction between the hero and heroine to make the reader believe that something special exists between them. Not so in Until You. The only thing I saw between them was physical attraction. It makes for an okay story, but something I had to skim through a lot and not something worth remembering.	2001-04-22

It had me engrossed from the first page. <br />Surrender To A Stranger takes place during the French Revolution. The heroine, Jacqueline, is convicted as a traitor to the new Republic of France and sentenced to death at the guillotine. She is rescued the night before her execution by the hero, Armand ,and whisked away to England. <br />I liked how Monk uses vivid description of France during this bloody reign of terror. The history was accurately portrayed, but be warned that it is somewhat disturbing. The bloodthirsty visciousness of the french population can be quite difficult to read at times. In other words, this is not a lighthearted read.<br />Also, the heroine does not begin the story as a very likable person. She is sheltered, spoiled and very classist. However, she does change as the story moves forward. As they say, live and learn and I believe that Monk did a terrific job of developing the heroine's character. <br />The romance is everything one could want in a story. Romantic conflict, sharing, passion and adventure. I also liked how they are not portrayed as these perfect people. They both have some issues they have to deal with which they help each other through.<br />All in all, this is a beautifly written story that I am glad to have read.	2001-04-14

In a nutshell, the hero, Tristan, invades the heroine's home, rapes her, and tells her she doesn't know the meaning of true rape? Okay so he didn't brutalize her but that's supposed to make it okay? And when she finds out she is pregnant and wants to rid herself of the baby, he slaps her. He forces her to marry him when the king threatens to take the home away that Tristan invaded. Later on in the story, he threatens to take away the child when he is mad at her.  This guy is the hero? Fifty pages after meeting him, I wanted to jump into the story and kill him. This is not a contemporary novel, but that does not mean that all men in this time period were brutalizing rapists. This is the last time I ever buy anything by this author.	2001-04-13

Julie Garwood has written some wonderful medeival stories like Honors Splendour, The Secret and The Prize but Gentle Warrior falls short of her work. One thing I have always liked about her stories is that the hero and heroine like more about each other than how they look. In this story, the hero marries a woman he doesn't even know because she is so beautiful and he wants to go to bed with her. After he gets what he wants, he treats her like dirt throughout the rest of the story except when they are in bed together. He even locks her in her room for a time. He doesn't change at all throughout the story. There is no sharing of a personal nature at all, and declarations of love come at the last two pages of the story after the hero spends the whole story treating his wife horribly. I am just glad that I have read other garwood novels before or I wouldn't have been reading anything else by her.	2001-03-28
US	51930495	R1912FWCD8XVZW	0380802317	746993091	Where Dreams Begin	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Great Story!	This is the first book by Lisa Kleypas that I have read and I was not disapointed. Zachary and Holly were very likable characters and you find yourself rooting for them from the beginning.<br /> I thought it was very different and refreshing that Holly was still grieving for her first husband. Usually stories with a widowed heroine portray the first husband as a wife beater or someone who was cold and was unfaithful. Where Dreams Begin portrays Holly's first husband as a nice person who cared for and cherished his wife. It made it believable that she had reservations about finding someone else. I also liked how Holly is strong, stubborn and has a mind of her own without being childish, contrary and petulant.<br />Zachary is exactly the sort of hero that I love reading about. He is a well developed character. Very ambitious, driven, ruthless, strong and opinionated but kind, loving and gentle at the same time. A perfect match for the heroine.<br />The romance is well paced and does revolve around sex. They fall in love after getting to know each other and liking each other as human beings instead of the cliched romances that seem to jump into love after nothing but physical desire and sex.<br />All in all, a very engaging, touching story.	2001-02-26

They are strong willed and they know how to stand up to their men. I hate stories where the men treat the heroines to verbal abuse, rape and other various cruelties and they just take it all the way up until the end. Virginia Henley's heroines do not tolerate this treatment for a second. I loved reading about the clash of wills between the hero and heroine in this story and Sabre(the heroine) does some of the most outrageous things that will have you laughing out loud.<br />If you are a Henley fan, don't skip this one.	2001-02-16

An exciting story,a good plot, a well paced romance and a mutual respect between the hero and heroine. I had my doubts about this story after reading Drake's previous &quot;Conquer The Night.&quot; Seize The Dawn is good in its historical detail with William Wallace and Scotland's fight for independence.

I don't like cruel, ruthless heroes who rape someone to get even with their enemy no matter how awful the enemy is. I don't like heroines who cry and moan rape and abuse but try to instigate the hero forcing themself on them again. This is pretty much what this book was. The hero imprisons and rapes the heroine, later on she is attracted to him and tries to instigates these sexual advances while still calling it force. The characters did not make any sense and the plot ran in circles until the conclusion. Needless to say, I won't be wasting my money on Shannon Drake again.	2001-01-02

There are some people who do not mind this, because it is a medieval romance novel.  I try to take the time setting into account, but I just cannot deal with a story where the heroine is punished by being locked away for over two weeks because she angers the hero. I also cannot deal with a jerk of a hero who considers himself the lord and master of everything. He gets angry and punishes the heroine for dealing with a crooked steward(I think it was the steward) without asking permission, locks her in a solar for a time later on in the book, and pretty much treats her like a marionette with him jerking the strings any way he pleases. I guess I am just one of those &quot;sensitive&quot; readers. Oh well, if any one else considers themselves in this class, you will not like this book and shouldn't waste their money.	2000-12-20

Lynn Kurland manages to create a wonderful story that captivates the reader without using any graphic sex scenes. Not many romance authors manage this. This Is All I Ask has to be one of the most heart-wrenching stories I have ever read. The main characters are real people with real faults dealing with very realistic issues that they help each other through. <br />The heroine, Gillian, was such a likeable character, and I almost started crying when I read about the rotten treatment she suffered at the hands of her father. And for those reviewers who complained about her low self esteem--stick with Virginia Henley because no one can go through what she went through without having a little problem with self-confidence.<br />I thought the romance between Gillian and Chris was nicely paced, and it was so nice to read a medeival romance where the hero is not acting like he is the lord and master and telling the heroine to learn her place. Chris slowly helped Gillian to gain some of her self-confidence and courage back which she did.<br />All in all, a wonderful read that will make you laugh, cry and read the book over again.	2000-11-27

This is a well written story that has a strong beginning, but is fizzles out in the end.<br />My biggest problem with Whitney My Love is the same problem that many people had: the rape scene. The hero, Clayton, committed this act on the heroine, Whitney, because some woman at a party told him Whitney has slept around. Clayton was angry and he wanted to hurt, degrade and humiliate Whitney. And he did. He hurt her so bad she screamed in pain and started crying hysterically. I just cannot have any respect for someone who could hurt someone that way in anger, no matter how bad he feels about what he did.<br />Another problem I had with this story is that Whitney actually has a really nice guy in France who has helped and supported her, loves her for the person she is, wants to marry her and make her happy and she chooses Clayton who will obviously turn against her if he thinks she is doing something he doesn't like. This is the third Judith McNaught story I have read and they are all like this. The heroine has a great guy who wants her, and she chooses the cruel, jaded, emotionally abusive hero.<br />Whitney My Love is well written, but I just could not get into the story. And after reading McNaught's Once And Always and Perfect, I have decided that while this author writes well, I will never be a big fan of hers. Sorry.	2000-11-21

The others bothered me for some reason that I could not put my finger on. After reading this book, I finally figured it out. The heros spend the novel telling the heroines what to do and what not to do. They are not cruel, but they treat the heroines like children and make it clear that they are the masters and decision-makers in the relationship.<br />Castles is a prime example of this. He dictated what Alesandra could wear, who she talked to and where she could go. I realize that this is a historical romance, but I still think that a marriage needs a certain degree of trust and mutual respect even in the 1800's. Without these elements, I do not see how there can be any love. Colin treated Alesandra like a toddler. He even kept her prisoner in the house when they were first married. <br />Alesandra was equally annoying. She insisted she would do what she pleased while following Colins orders, and she did not come off very bright. I think Ms. Garwood tossed in the detail that she was so brilliant with numbers to make her appear smart, but I never saw her use this ability.<br />All in all, a very annoying novel that had a very similiar storyline with The Gift, Guardian Angel, and Lions Lady. No insult to Julie Garwood. She has written some wonderful stories like Ransom, Saving Grace and The Secret. I am not through reading Julie Garwood but i've had it with her regency romance books.	2000-11-13

I could not put it down until I finished it. I gave it three stars because I could not understand why the characters did some of the things they did. I could not understand why Adrian married the heroine for revenge. I felt horrible for the things he went through, but marrying someone to hurt his brother was so cruel and vicious. It was mean to his brother and downright cruel to use a woman that way who did absolutely nothing to deserve it. I like strength in a character and marrying the woman his brother wanted to hurt him is so cruel and juvenile I could not find respect for him. The way he told Lilliana his motives after they married to hurt her was even worse. Adrian struck out at his wife constantly when he was hurt or his ego was struck. He was hurt and he lashed out to hurt other people. I felt so sorry for his wife because at the end of the story I did get the feeling that he changed.	2000-11-10

When I read Earth Song, I could not wait to get my hands on the final novel of this trilogy. When I read it I was very disappointed. The hero, Roland, was horrible mean throughout the story to a point that became difficult for me to stomach. In a way, I could understand why he acted the way he did because he did believe, with just cause, that his wife, Daria, was pregnant with someone else's baby. However, when Daria suffered a miscarriage, he acted downright cruel. She suffered a miscarriage saving the life of one of his friends, and when she was recovering, Roland made it apparent that he was more concerned about the guilt his friend was feeling. In fact, he physically carried her into his friends room and told her that she was going to stop being so self-centered and assuage his friends guilt. After I read this, I could not give any credibility to the fact that he ended up professing his love to Daria, and I felt that she deserved better. I realize that I was reading a medeival romance, but that does not mean that it has to have a hero who can be so cruel and mean about one of the most tragic things that can happen to a woman. If anyone wants to read a truly good medeival romance, try Castles In the Air by Christina Dodd.	2000-10-03

She has a talent for making her characters come alive and capture the reader. But she didn't use the talent in this book. The heroine,Marian,was so exasperating I was clenching my teeth. She was described as someone who was independent and could take care of herself, but she did the stupidest things that got her into trouble and then she needed to be rescued. So much for being able to take care of herself. This was not Christina Dodd's usual writing style. Her heroines are usually pragmatic, strong women who can handle problems on their own. My personal favorites are Castles In The Air, Treasure of The Sun, and Once A Knight.	2000-09-22

I usually like Lynne Graham's books, but a lot of them have heroes that  are complete jerks. In this book the hero, Juaquin del Castillo, is an  arrogant tycoon who was nothing but cruel throughout the story. He treated  the heroine, Lucy, horribly and she fell in love with him anyway. He talked  to her like some teenage guy with an overabundance of testosterone. If  someone was that crude and desrespectful to me I would take a gun to him.  He was cruel to her right to the very last five pages where he suddenly  says that he loves her. Did I miss something here? I realize that he  thought she was her con artist twin sister, but what bothered me was that  when he realized Lucy was pretending to be her twin, he had the nerve to  get angry with her for lying to him when he did nothing to gain her trust.  The heroine, Lucy, is like a doormat during the whole story. She takes  Juaquin's insults all the way to the bitter end and falls in love with him  anyways. It was almost painful to read. I'm not saying that Lynne Graham is  a terrible author. She has written some great books. I loved The Unfaithful  Wife, Bond Of Hatred and The Spanish Groom.	2000-09-06

Instead I got one of the most depressing books I have ever read. El lobo had such a horrible, tragic life and it just kept getting worse for him. I  mean how much can a person go through? The heroine, Storm, had an awful  life too. Towards the end of the book, I felt like I was reading a novel by  VC Andrews or Rosemary Rogers.	2000-05-06

However, there was a lot of violence. There were numerous incidents of marital rape that the sensitive reader might find repulsive,and the hero did slap the heroine many times. Normally, this would repulse me but you  have to read the whole story to understand the violent context. The love  between the hero and heroine was very real and touching. Before judging the  story on the title, I recommend that you read the book and make the  decision on your own.	2000-04-24

You will fall in love with Rafe within the first five  pages.  And the story is so good, with some hot sensuality packed in. Read  this book, I guarantee you will love it as much as I do.	2000-04-12

The author didn't waste any opportunity to mention those particular attributes. It was as if the author was repetitively trying to describe how beautiful Katie was to make up for  the fact that she was shallow, bigoted and snobby.  She assumed that the  hero, Ramon, drove the dumpy produce truck she saw on the street because he  had a spanish accent and she continously treated like he was a stupid,  uneducated moron throughout the book.   And Ramon was no better.  He  decides that he loves her because she insults some guys in a singles bar  even after she insults and offends him throughout the whole book.  The  overall book was boring and I started hoping that they would not end up  together.	2000-04-10

Having read this book, I do not know what everyone is talking about with the marital rape. Do not get me wrong, I thought some of the sex scenes were conducted with force.  However, it seemed that the scenes were put in  context with the wrongness of the act.  He wanted his wife to learn how to  feel pleasure with him, but he actually did feel remorse for any force he  used. You want to read a Coulter book with real marital rape? Read  Midsummer Magic, Rosehaven and Calypso Magic. And the &quot;heros in this  book did not feel an ounce of remorce for what they did because, in their  opinion, they were trying to teach their wives that is was their place to  submit.  Now those books have the real thing.  This was a cute book, but I  have come to the opinion that Coulter is not a talented writer. If you want  to read a really good historical romance, read Christina Dodd's Treasure Of  The Sun.  I guarantee you will be converted.	2000-04-04

You will fall in love with him ten pages within the book.  And Katherine is a typical sensible heroine typical in Christina Dodd's books.  There was good  chemistry between the hero and heroine, and their love was so real. Anyone  considering this book, i'm telling you, you will not be dissapointed in  this one.	2000-04-01

He humiliated her in front of his friends on a cruel bet. Later on, he gets himself betrothed to her without winning her forgiveness first.  Sofia  would have been better off without him and I did not think he deserved her.   He showed absolutely no consideration for her feelings, and no remorse for  the humiliating things that he did to her. If you want to read a good  medieval romance, read her other two medievals Wonderful and Wild, but  leave this one alone.	2000-03-27

Raymond was a man who was very sensitive to the feelings of the heroine. I am so sick of hearing the hero say that he is a warrior and he does not feel love for another woman  because it will make him weak. And the heroine was just as great.  She was  strong, compassionate, considerate, logical but she had flaws just like  everyone else.  The love story was wonderful.  You get to see this couple  change and mature together and become stronger with each others support.   Read this book!   You will not be dissapointed!	2000-03-27

Chandra was a woman ahead of her time, and she was a very capable.  I am sick of reading about fragile, weak women with a core of steel.  Chandra was strong in every way, both physically and emotionally.	2000-01-10

The hero was a jerk, who did not care about how his bride felt and liked embarrasing her, and the heroine is one of the biggest fluffheads I have ever read about.  She sets out to demand a courtship from her husband and a period of time to  get to know him better, and she ends up listing off her good points to him  and trying to sell herself to him like a chunk of meat. She always  contradicts herself, it becomes obvious that she does not know what she  wants. Julie Garwood has written so much better.	1999-12-20
US	51930495	R36QU8ZT5UH18Q	0451402383	236170956	Fire Song (Song Novels)	Books	3	21	26	N	N	Good Story, Bad Hero	This is a story that you cannot put down until you finish. The hero, Graelam, was introduced in a preceding novel by Catherine Coulter called Chandra. I read Chandra before Fire Song and read about the way Graelam  ruthlessly raped a young woman who was a virgin. He did it out of some sort  of power trip, and it made me thououghly disgusted with his character.  After reading that, I could not see him in any sort of heroic light and it  sort of ruined fire song for me. A man who commits any kind of rape, is no  hero and I don't like how the author makes him out to be one in this novel.  I believe it gives the message that rape is okay and it makes me sick. I do  not care what century this book takes place in, rape is wrong.	1999-12-15

The characters are unforgetable and the romance was great. Jasper and Olivia were two very unforgetable people, and the situations  they find themselves in will make you laugh throughout the book.	1999-11-26

But I was really disappointed in this story.  I did not like Deinwald de Fortenbery.  He treated the heroine with verbal disrespect and made fun of her because she  was not little and petite.  As for the heroine, Philippa began the story  fighting him and not tolerating his insults, but, after a few chapters, she  tolerated his disrespect like it was nothing.  He said he loved her, but he  was never tender or loving even when they were in bed together.  He treated  her like she was his whore.  And it really irritated me to hear him call  her &quot;wench.&quot; I was hoping he would change like Graelem did in  Fire Song, but the change never came. I actually threw the book across the  room. For those who have not read this story, I would recommend that you  not waste your money on it.  I am still angry at the six dollars that I  wasted on this book.  Read another of Catherine Coulters books like Devil's  Embrace, Valentine Legacy, or Fire Song.	1999-10-11

This had to be the worst piece of trash I have ever read.  I have never been a great fan of historical romance, but this is by far the worst book I have ever read.  I  do not care if the story takes place in the 12th century, rape is wrong no  matter what date in time or if the rapist is your husband.  I counted three  times when the &quot;hero&quot; Severin raped his wife, Hastings.  It  disgusted me.  On top of the rapes, Severin treated Hastings like she was  nothing better than a brood mare and a possession.  Forget that if it  wasn't for her, he would have no money or land of his own.  The message  behind the story bothered me to.  It was a message of male dominance and  control.  I find it unbelievable that a twentieth century woman would write  such shit.  It is very hard to like a story when you hate the hero.  For  anyone who is considering buying this book, my honest advice to you is do  not waste your money on this book.	1999-10-07

His only option is to marry an heiress, and he decides on Victoria. Victoria likes adventure in her life. She is unconventional and independent, and Lucas uses this to get close to her. He takes her on midnight escapades until they are caught by her aunt and forced to marry. <br />Once married, he turns into a tyrant and quickly suppresses any unconventional hobbies she does. As this is a regency novel, I normally would not mind this but I draw the line when the hero trys to change the heroine into something she simply is not. <br />The heroine, Victoria, begins the story as an independent woman who is slightly unconventional and I didn't like to read of her losing control of things that meant so much to her in the start of the story. Her free use of her own money, her intellectual exploration and flamboyant dress style were quickly put to an end by the hero.<br />I won't let this put me off Amanda Quick. Rendevous, Mystique, and Ravished are among my favorites.	1999-02-03
