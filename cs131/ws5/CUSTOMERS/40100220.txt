What about the claims that people make that have encountered alien life forms visiting Earth?<br />You can find a lot of UFO book on the market that claim they hold the answers to this puzzling phenomenon but they usually only leave you with more questions then answers.<br />Lights in the sky breaks the trend.  It proves the answers to the UFO mystery.  <br />It starts by making the case that life on other plants is highly improbable and interstellar space travel is even more improbable and borders on impossible due sheer distance and the dangers of space travel.  These claims are backed up with science and it goes into some depth.  Meanwhile, the idea of a government cover-up can be chalked up to simple slow moving bureaucratic procedures.  <br />Lights makes the claim that real UFO encounters are of a more super nature occurrence and are usually experienced by people who have a connection with the Occult.  That these experiences are of demonic origins.  Before you scoff at this idea keep in mind that idea of UFOs as we know them became popularized as the human race pioneered space travel.  Pervious to then, people claimed to have seen &quot;air ships&quot; at the turn of the century and &quot;fairies&quot; and other mystical beings before then.<br />Lights in the Sky is well written and well research and is a must read for anybody interested in UFOs.  Its aimed for a Christian audience but its not at all preachy.  Its a work that should be taken seriously by both Christian and non-Christians.	2003-01-26

He has written a clearly anti-Masonic book that doesn't seek to take an honest look at Freemasonry but is a web of fantasy and lies.<br />This book is a follow up to Knight's other book in which he claimed that Jack the Ripper either was a Mason or had some help from them.  Both of these claims are utterly false and have been discredit.  His evidence is flimsy and must be so distorted and out of context that it isn't even logical.<br />In this book Knight claims many &quot;unnamed&quot; sources as being some kind of &quot;high ranking&quot; British Masons.  Of course he rarely names his sources.  However, one of his main wells of misinformation called the &quot;West End Mason&quot; was found not to even be a British Mason, and perhaps not even a Mason at all.  The &quot;West End Mason&quot; identified himself, you can find his anti-Masonic and very disrupting anti-Semitic rants on the Internet, if this is the kind of sources he's going to use, then it brings into question the integrity of the work as a whole.<br />Knight also goes on a rant trying to connect the Italian P2 lodge with a political crisis in Italy.  However its just silly.  Freemasonry banished any connection with this Lodge long before the scandal occurred.  However The P2 Lodge continued to operate on ITS OWN as a secret, psuedo-Masonic body.  Any logical person cannot hold an organization at fault when a few its members on their own decide to break off and purse other courses on their own.<br />Most anti-Masonic works sell by creating falsely generated tactics to caught attention.  This books is well, rather dull.  But non the less its more a work of fiction since the author claimed that he was being a neutral observer when he had no intentions what so ever to be.	2002-01-30

Reassessing the Presidency shatters long held myths about some of the occupants of the White House and instead exposes their real actions.  Denson's work documents how the decline of liberty and the rise in power of the executive of the United States has gone hand in hand.<br />The opening part of the book focusses on how presidents are &quot;ranked&quot; by historians, drawing the conclusion that most often, presidents that created more outlays by spending more and enlarging the federal budget where ranked as better then those who were more fiscally conservative with the taxpayers dollars.  While the closing section is devoted to the impossibly of a limited government and offers the solutions in overcoming our current situation.<br />Denson then takes a critical look at the Lincoln and Roosevelt administration as both men used war and crisis to further enhance their power and control.  Well, outside the presidency's constitutional limits.  And how future presidents such as Truman would further build on earlier power grabs, turning the executive branch into what it has become today.<br />Denson's work even takes a look at some less know and documented president's and their role such as Van Buren work in the creation of modern political parties.  And how the Supreme Court has acted helped to create the modern presidency.<br />It's an excellent work that strips away warm fuzzy feelings about past presidents and takes a much needed critical look at their actions.	2002-01-21

This idea led him to research the downfall of the Knights Templar in part of the book and later the rise of Freemasonry in the other half.<br />Freemasonry's legendary origins are based on the guilds of stone masons of Europe, however &quot;Born in Blood&quot; tackles these long held ideas and makes counter arguments that Freemasonry may have instead grown out of the Knights Templar.<br />Robinson draws many highly researched parallels in history, ritual, and practice between the ancient Knights Templar and past and modern Freemasonry which go way beyond the area of mere coincidence.  Such as how Masonic dress, oaths, and practices have direct links back to the Knights Templar.  While at the same time pointing out obvious facts in history, such as both groups are the only two in the world that claim King Solomon's Temple as their birthplace.   <br />In closing, Robinson deals with a few falsehoods created by Anti-Masonic people and groups such as Jim Shaw and his book &quot;The Brotherhood&quot;.  Robinson quickly debunks their claims and points out them as being erroneous and clearly false.<br />Born in Blood is well researched, interesting, and even entertaining.  After publishing his work, Robinson went on to become a Freemason himself and was later honored for his historical contributions to Freemasonry.	2002-01-02

Ridley takes a critical look at Freemasonry and its place and members in history.  To date this has been the best, most honest, and accurate look at Freemasonry throughout history up to the year 2000.<br />Instead of looking at just the internal history of Freemasonry, Ridley writes about its influence (and it's members) on the world and how the world has influence it throughout history.  The books places the craft in a historical context in the fact that the book explains what historical events were occurring and how it effect Freemasonry.  Such as the American and French Revolutions.<br />Meanwhile, Ridley sheds light on the Masons and sweeps away the lies and half truths of others that have come before him and takes an honest look at the craft.<br />Ridley makes a solid case that in his work that instead of being some secret world wide conspiracy to control events or the world, Masons are often divided on the great issues of the day.  However, English and American Masons forbid any political discussion within their lodges.  Ridley points out that in every war, Masons supported and fought for their respective countries, which pitted Masons of different sides against each other.  Ridley also documents how Freemasons were often the target of oppression and witch hunts started by dictators who have banned the craft and the formation of lodges.<br />The Freemasons is a great book for it's historical look at the craft and the history surrounding it both inside and outside.  It takes a look at who were some of history's most famous Masons.  While at the same time, not all Masons were angels.. but in the end showing that Freemasonry has always stood for the ideals of morality and freedom.	2001-12-24

Freemasonry is a subject that alot of people don't know about and fewer truly understand, which makes gleaning useful information difficult.  Even talking to some Masons might leave you with more questions then answers after your done.<br />However Roberet MacOy's work in &quot;A Dictionary of Freemasonry&quot; provides light to anyone seeking Masonic history and information.  MacOy's work is part history, part encylopedia, and part dictionary.  It starts with a brief history of Freemasonry and lists the terminology in two different volumes using an A-Z dictionary format.  It explains the people, places, terms, and symbols that you would ever want to know about and much more.<br />Every lodge should have a few copies of this work on hand and anyone with an interest in Freemasonry must have one on their bookshelf too.

Its not really a dirty little kiss and tell book.  Its more of a personal look at Ted Kennedy by someone that was close to him and knew him well.<br />In the end, as Burke says, Kennedy for all his flaws cannot do a lot of harm as the respected Senator that he is now, so long as he doesn't become President, but his chance has already passed.	2001-12-17

Once you get into 1945, you won't want to put it down as the stakes raise, the action keeps rising and the plot thickens in a story that might have become history.  The United States emerges from World War II the victors over Japan and the far east, however the United States never battled Germany, who now controls Europe and has its eye on Soviet Union, or maybe they now have the US in their sites as they left as the only two remaining super powers.<br />The characters in the story are a little one sided but still very good. Twist and turning sub plots and action they engage in easily make up any shortfalls in the charatchers though for it and make the novel interesting and exciting.  The only downside is that the sequel for the book has yet to be written and may never be.  However, don't let it stop you from reading 1945 for its stand alone value.<br />What makes the book interesting is that for the most part is its use of real historical characters, political and military, of the time, a few are made up as needed, but for the most part, it helps make the novel seem highly real.<br />It's 1945, but it could have been our future...	2001-12-15

It examines the time of civil unrest in California (student uprisings, Watts riots) at the time and how Pat Brown could not understand nor could he control what was happening.<br />The book is interesting because it flips between both Reagan and Brown's sides of the story, their campaigns and the time and events that they lived in at the time.  It really captures the mood and feel of 1966 California.  It really explains why Reagan won and Brown, while fairly popular during his two terms and after defeating Richard Nixon, lost to a political novice while the liberal ideal's fell to the coming conservative movement.	2001-12-07

First off, don't even waste your money on this book or any work by Ed Decker.  The man makes a living off bashing Freemasonry by writing books and speaking and promoting himself.<br />Moromons happen to be Decker's other target for bashing and attacks in once again, a sorry way of making living and promoting himself.  He happened to be a Mormon himself but was tossed out after it was found that he comminted adultry.<br />Decker just uses the same old tired arugments againest Freemasonry that others used in the past.  However these objections were never fully reserached, some are half truths, while other are just outright lies.<br />Decker doesn't write books and speak about Freemasonry or the Mormon Church to inform people, if he wanted to do that, he'd be honest with them, he only does it for it profit and futher to promote himself.	2001-11-26

Marr's has said before that <br />Marr's has said that &quot;Unless it was an act of God, it was a conspiracy&quot;.  With that concept in mind, he penned this book.  Marr's starts with recent history and works his way back through time trying to uncover what might have been conspiracies, some times begin, but other times sinister.<br />Jim Marr's book is a very interesting read, however sometimes it plays fast with the facts which is why I suggest taking it with a grain of salt and don't be afraid to do your own research and come to your own conclusions.  The book is very informative but some times vital facts are left out and the arguments he puts fourth aren't always clear.<br />Marr's does however provide research into how historal events were or might have been shaped.  Such as:  *The formation of the Federal Reserve Banking system, *The Rothschild family of Europe financing both the North and South during the civil war. *Many other people and events that &quot;may&quot; have been brought about an unseen hand starting with the Kennedy Administration dating back to the days of Moses.<br />An exciting book, but take it with a grain of salt.	2001-11-18
