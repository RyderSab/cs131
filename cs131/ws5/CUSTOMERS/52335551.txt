This book opened my eyes to the plight of the Spaniards after the Civil War, and the amazing juggling act Franco pulled off to keep Spain out of the war. Franco showed tremendous courage and ingenuity to resist the incredible pressure brought to bear by the Germans to bring Spain into the war, which would have allowed German troops to pass through Spain and capture Gibraltar. The German capture of Gibraltar in 1940 would have had catastrophic implications for the British and allowed the Germans to dominate the Mediterranean and Northern Africa. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in World War II, and congratulate the authors for bringing this little known story to light.	2004-10-01

It started out with some promise, but quickly went down hill. One of the biggest problems I had with the book was that it was situated on a fictional island. I am at a loss as to why the author would want to write a novel about World War II and not place it in one of the many Pacific island battles. The second problem was the portrayal of battle by the author. There was no sense or purpose to what the characters were doing other than surviving under horrible conditions, which the author discussed on every page. There was a sense of moral equivalency in that the U.S. soldiers were not fighting for any purpose whatsoever other than sheer survival, and that events were driven by the powers-that-be. Never mind that the U.S. was attacked by Japan, along with the fact that the Japanese were trying to forceably install their rule throught Asia and the Pacific islands. Because of this book, I have steered clear of any other works by this author, as I was barely able to finish this one and gutted it out through sheer willpower!	2004-09-10

Despite what some of the other reviewers say, the facts simply speak for themselves and Pipes does not have to be \\"biased\\" to portray the Bolsheviks for the evil monsters that they really were. This book goes a long way in explaining how a small group of fanatics could take control of a large country such as Russia.

This is an excellent portrayal of one of the greatest monsters in human history. I have read some of the other reviews which attempt to cast doubt on the some of the author's findings and conclusions. First off, based upon everything else I have already read on Stalin, I personally have no reason to doubt anything in this book.  Secondly, the facts that the author lived through most of this period, and had access to formerly closed Soviet Archives greatly bolsters his credibility.  What I think is the most important aspect of this book, however, is the unequivocal portrayal of Stalin as the ...menace that he was.  Too often, biographies or portrayals of Stalin describe the horrors and atrocities committed under his rule, yet attempt to partially mitigate these crimes with the rationalizations that they were somehow necessary as Stalin had to industrialize the Soviet Union in a short time period, or prepare the country to defeat Adolf Hitler.  This book does a tremendous service to the history of the Soviet Union, and Communism in general, by dispelling such nonsense.  The other myth this book destroys is that Stalin somehow \\"hijacked\\" the revolution, and was not really the product of the system put in place by Lenin and the Revolution of 1917.  Hogwash!  As this book shows, Lenin groomed Stalin every step of the way to assume power in the Party and Government.  True, they parted ways at the end, and Lenin did write the letter that Stalin was \\"too rude\\" to take over.  What others have consisently failed to mention, however, was that Lenin had nothing good to say about the other Bolshevik leaders either.  While the author doesn't state this, the conclusion I draw is that Lenin resented Stalin for the fact that Stalin had effectively taken away Party, and Government, leadership from him.  Stalin was the logical extension of Marxism/Leninism.<br />The book is very well written, and is a highly enjoyable read.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in Stalin and/or Soviet history.  The author is to be saluted for having the courage to face up to this period in Russian history, and present these events in such a way that shows [what]Communism truly represented.  Highly Recommended!!	2002-05-01

The characters are all well-developed, both fictional and historical.

While curious, I was initially reluctant to read it as I wasn't sure how the author was going to treat the subject, particularly Hitler. In our current atmosphere of political correctness, Hitler is a very difficult subject to tackle. How to portray him? Having read many biographies of Hitler, I feel the author did an excellent job. In this book, Hitler is not a one-dimensional, cartoonish character, but a complex, well-developed individual. Through his relationship with his family, particularly Geli, early on you come to the realization that something is missing from his personality. Hitler lacks the ability to emphathize with others, cannot love nor understand others. These early relationships are a scary foretaste of the evil that he would bring upon the rest of humanity. The only reason that I rated this &quot;4&quot; stars rather than &quot;5&quot; is my opinion that the author did not really develop Geli's character, particularly her attraction to Hitler. This may be harsh, however, as so little is really known about her. All in all, however, this is an excellent story. Make your own judgements on the ending. Suicide or murder? In my opinion, given the relationship between Hitler and Geli, it probably could have gone either way.	2001-10-11

Whether you are new to the battle, or you have read other accounts, I think you will enjoy this book. The one thing I really appreciated was the author's objectivity. Many accounts either have a pro-German (valiant German warriors beaten by ineffective strategy) or pro-Soviet (valiant Soviet warriors defeating the fascist monsters) bias. Beevor detailed the horror that this battle truly was, the ruthlessness and inhumanity on both sides. In the beginning, he shows how the Russian soldier was ruthlessly sacrificed by the Soviets, and Stalin, and how this changed at the end where the German soldier was ruthlessly sacrificed by the Nazis and Hitler. One of the most refreshing aspects of the book, however, was the author's treatment of the German allies, particularly the Italian's and Rumanian's. Rather than portraying them as the scapegoats for German defeat, he detailed the criminal way these soldiers were treated, from the lack of modern weaponry to the way they were stretched so thin as to make it impossible for them to offer any kind of organized resistance. The battle was not lost by these soldiers, rather by the arrogance of the German High Command in thinking they could continue to suffer horrendous losses in futile street fighting in the City of Stalingrad itself. Also invaluable is the author's portrayal of conditions in the &quot;Kessel&quot; after the Russian encirclement of the Sixth Army. This is an excellent addition to the history of this historic and titanic struggle.	2001-10-11

The author lays out in detail the history of the Russian Revolution, and how in the end it was the people who ended up the losers. Written without an ideological agenda, the author shows how the Bolsheviks took over power by being the most ruthless, and least willing to compromise, group of Russian revolutionaries. Truly sad in its depiction of the initial resistance of the people to the Bolsheviks, and how this resistance was brutally crushed. This book lays to rest any myths remaining of the &quot;popular&quot; uprising of 1917. The revolution is shown for what is truly was, a takeover of a semi-literate society by a group of ruthless individuals willing to do anything to acquire power. Highly recommended.	2001-06-23

For the life of me I couldn't quite understand what drove Jean Casson to do what he did, other than vague patriotism. Adept at re-creating Pre-WWII and WWII Europe in his other novels, Furst falls flat in this one. Casson seems to wander through the book from one liason to another. The German occupation is in some instances, a minor backdrop, to Casson's search for love and/or sex. The ending was very disappointing to me. Being written by Furst, it is readable, which is why I've given it three stars. If you are new to Furst, you would be better off to start with another of his novels (Red Star, Polish Officer, Night Soldiers) to really get a true taste of his capabilities. If you are already a fan, like myself, you'll probably want to get it to round out your collection.	2001-06-23

While the author does justice to the deep love between Harold and Edith, it doesn't dominate the story.

I particularly enjoyed the way he divided the book into three parts, each narrated by a different individual. In this way, the different stages of Arthur's life are better portrayed. The main reason that I didn't give this book 5 stars is the fact that this is more a work of fantasy than an attempt to place the Arthurian legend in British history.

That is not to say that the book is not  historically accurate. When the book does discuss Britain, it is for the  most part historically accurate.

The setting  (Vichy France during WWII) and the interplay between the two detectives  (one French, one German) adds spice to a fine storyline. I have to disagree  with the reviewer who complained about too many merde's and Gott in  Himmel's. They do not get in the way of the story at all.

I've just finished reading this book and felt obliged to write this review so that others would not waste their time and money as I have. To put some perspective on this when I purchased this book I thought I was buying a book which would acknowledge the evils of Communism and Stalinism. As I  began to read it however, I slowly began to realize that the author's true  intent was to rehabilitate the memory of Adolph Hitler. Written in the  style of a novel, Hitler plays the largest role in the book. He comes  across as a thoughtful, even kindly individual who decided to kill the Jews  against his morals and better judgement! This is a direct quote from the  epilogue: &quot;Adolph Hitler's bravery in facing up to the communist  threat at the cost of his international reputation and his life is rarely  acknowledged.&quot; Based upon the author's viewpoint, Hitler was  &quot;forced&quot; to persecute and kill the Jews of Europe to prevent them  from aiding in the Communist overthrow of Germany and Europe. One scene in  the book actually has him trying to convince a Jewish inmate in Dachau to  spread Stalin's crime amongst the world jewry. If only the Jews realized  what they were doing, Hitler would never have ordered the Holocaust!   Another scene has him confessing to a PRIEST about his doubts, and  reluctance of eliminating the Jewish population of Germany!  Please bear  in mind that I am a STAUNCH anti-communist. To me, Communism and Nazism are  interchangeable. The West is grossly overdue in acknowledging not only the  horrors of Stalin, but of Communism world-wide. This does not justify  however, an attempt to make Hitler a &quot;good guy&quot; because he  &quot;only&quot; killed 6,000,000 and then only to fight Communism. I will  go farther. Books like this do an injustice to all of the honorable men and  women who fought Communism at the cost of their reputations (in the West)  and their lives (in Communist countries). Liberals, Media and all Fellow  Travelers love to point out examples like this as representing  anti-communists of all stripes. Read &quot;The Black Book of  Communism&quot; or anything by David Horowitz to truly understand what  Communists perpetrated in the name of &quot;Humanity and Equality&quot;.

I do  agree that Dark Star and Night Soldiers are probably better novels, however  The Polish Officer is still far superior to most current fiction. I highly  recommend this to anyone!	2000-03-16

The premise of this story is brilliant, however Harris is unable to pull it off in a convincing fashion. While it keeps your attention throughout, the ending is somewhat unrealistic and disappointing. If you are looking  for an escape into a thriller this may do, however don't expect it to  portray a realistic portrait of Modern Russia. Additionally, other than the  main character, all of the other players are relatively superficial.	2000-03-11

I've read this book, Night Soldiers and am in the process of reading The Polish Officer. All are outstanding! If you are  interested in this period at all, do yourself a favor and pick up one of  these books!	2000-03-10

Throws a great deal of light on what had been a obscure subject. The ending is totally unexpected. Enjoy!	2000-03-10

This was an incredibly interesting book about one of the now-forgotten characters of American history.  The author does a great job in portraying Depression era Oklahoma, and how outlaws such as Pretty Boy Floyd came to  be. After reading this book, it is clear that Pretty Boy Floyd was a bandit  who had more in common with figures such as Jesse and Frank James than  contemporary gangsters such as Al Capone. I would highly recommend this  book to anyone interested in this period of Americana. The only flaw in  this book is the rather shallow characterization of Floyd himself. While  not quite whitewashing Pretty Boy Floyd, the author quickly glosses over  any negative characteristics while expounding on Floyd's positive traits  such as his generosity and good nature. In all likelihood Floyd was a  complex figure, and the book would have done greater service to his memory  had it presented a more balanced view.	1999-11-03

This is an incredible story, and is a must read whether or not you are interested in World War II history.  The author vividly recreates the era of the thirties and forties in Nazi Germany and allows you to gain deep  insight into the mind and character of Dietrich Bonhoeffer.  Before reading  this book, I had only heard of Dietrich Bonhoeffer.  This incredible story  showed me in great detail what a holy man he truly was.  You will find  yourself drawn into the intrigues of the anti-Hitler conspiracy.  The  bravery and courage of this gentle man against such an evil regime is  sobering, particularly given the moral relativism which is so prevalent  today.  I have been reading World War II history, and the history of Nazi  Germany for over 30 years.  Not until I finished this book did I truly  comprehend the evil that Adolf Hitler represented.  For her first novel  Mary Glazener was magnificant!!	1999-10-19
