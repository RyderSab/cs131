She takes on extra work to help the blind filly, causing tension at school and at home, especially since her grades have been dropping. Plus Sam is afraid the Phantom has lost all the trust in her he once had, and this upsets her greatly. <br />This series is consistently good. I liked that in this book we meet another character (Mrs. Allen) and we get to know a character (Darrell) who we haven't heard much from. It adds a little bit of spice to the series, as well as the new horses and changing seasons. This book is definately worth reading!	2003-02-20

The Phantom seems to be appearing in places he shouldn't be, and the ranch is tight on money, a constant supply of worry for Dad and Gram. Then Jake has an accident, and the Phantom goes missing. Sam thinks that Karla Starr, the low-life rodeo contractor who doesn't play by the rules, has stolen him, but she has no proof.<br />This was yet another excellent book in the Phantom Stallion series!! There was not much of Jake and his cleverness after the accident, but there was lots of action to make up for it, and humor and emotion, and even some sadness. All in all, excellent. Can't wait for the next one!	2002-12-31

To make things worse, Dad and Gram have agreed to go along with a program called HARP, where at risk kids work on training mustangs. This means that Sam and Jake must open River Bend Ranch to a rebelious girl called Mikki. And Dad and Brynna Olsen seem to be seeing a lot more of each other than they should. <br />This was a great book! It had a lot of emotion and it was nice to see a new character. There was lots of action--definately a top book in the series. Loved it and can't wait for more!	2002-12-31

She's just starting her freshman year of high school and she's worried about making friends, other than her 16 year old pal Jake, who teases her for being a freshman. Another thing that has her worried is the family's financial situation, and Linc Slocum's accusation that her mustang, The Phantom, stole his prize Appaloosa filly. Sam knows it's not the Phantom stealing mares, but a blue roan she calls Hammer, and she's determined to prove it.<br />This is another great book in The Phantom Stallion series. I really liked it and I am eagerly awaiting the next one. Once again the emotions in the book are very real, especially concerning Jake and his guilt over her accident years before. I really recommend this book not only for ages 9-12, but for teenagers as well.	2002-08-07

Her mother marries Maurice, a rich but heartless man who promptly sends Tessa away to boarding school. Tessa's attitude gets her expelled from more than a few schools by the time she's twelve, and in a last attempt to rid Tessa from his home, Maurice shoves her off to a stable two miles from the home where steeplechasers are trained. It is a humble place, and Tessa wants to be anywhere but there. She tries to get herself kicked out, but ends up forming a friendship with the stable staff, especially after the arrival of an ugly colt who turns out to be the son of the mare she loved as a child. Tessa knows he is great, and she intends to prove it by winning the Grand National. But that's not quite so easy when she must deal with the problem of her stepfather--and deal with him she does, in her own unique way. <br />This book was excellent. Racing knowledge is good and helps push the believability of this story. The characters are real and the author is not afraid to show their bad sides or the negative sides to life. A nice, long, satisfying read that will leave you wanting more, it plays with your emotions. I loved it.	2002-07-30

Heartland 9 was published in French in June and since I am in Europe I read it. (Its called Le Messager de l espoir). <br />Amy is officially going out with Ty, but theres trouble in paradise; for the first time, they are not agreeing about everything, from what to do about their new project, Mercury, a horse who has lost his will to jump, to how they should act in their relationship. Not only is Mercury an interesting project because of this, but also because this is the first horse theyve enlisted Bens help with. Then Amy has an idea---to bring Mercury to the old Cherokee who taught her mother...but its a big risk and theres a lot she has to learn.<br />This was one of the best books in the series. It was set in a different context--Amy wasnt the queen of the world, no one was agreeing, and it was more like real life. The writing was fresh, the setting new. I really liked it.<br />The tenth one comes out here in Sept, and its called Tomorrows Promise in English. *UPDATE* According to the French description, Tomorrow's Promise is as follows:<br />When Sundance injures his tendon, Amy can no longer compete in the shows. Her father gives her a gift of another horse so she can compete, and while competing, she meets Daniel (the name might be different in English), a young rider on the show circuit.	2002-07-07

I read it quickly and enjoyed it. In this book Amy takes on two new horses, Rosie and Feather, who both have their own separate problems, while she has a problem of her own. She's dreading the visit from her father Lou has been waiting for so much, but soon she realizes that she has a lot in common with him. <br />This book is mostly about Amy, Lou, and their father and their relationship. There is very little mention of Amy and Ty's relationship, and I do understand that their romance has to spread through all the books. I gave this four stars because i liked it but the pattern was the same. Amy finds out what the problem of all the horses is, and at the end they have some epiphany about their family. Of course, Scott and Ty and Ben are just wonderful ppl who are willing to help all the time. My mom enjoyed the first five, couldn't read the 6th or 7th, and read this one without missing a beat. They never seem to move forward.<br />Good job, but let's not get tedious!!	2002-05-16

She herself is a close \\"advisor\\" of Edward VI! The book documents her trip through time and its effect on the world.<br />I love history and romance, so I thought I would love this book. But it wasn't the greatest I'd ever read. The beginning of her stay in 1553 was dragging by halfway through the book and her emotions were not really shown. One minute she would be hysterical and want to go home, and then the next minute she didn't seem to care. Some parts were detailed while others were vague. Her character was not consistent. Then she only met the guy she was to fall in love with (and my did they fall in love pretty fast) near the end of the book. I guess the idea of how her meddling changed history was interesting, but the end was just plain weird. This book could have been a lot better.	2002-02-24

He's terribly damaged emotionally. To make things worse, his fame thrusts Heartland into the spotlight. It's time for Melody and Daybreak to find a home, but Amy doesn't want to give up the little filly just yet. Then, on top of that, there's Ty. They kissed at Christmas, but what did that mean? She tries to avoid conversations with him, but she can't wait forever. <br />This was an excellent Heartland book! It manages to juggle a variety of story lines while still in the usual Heartland quality. Amy's trying to push back a lot of her emotions, so it will be interesting to see what happens, and to Prince, whose story remains only just beginning. Don't pass this one up--even if it doesn't tie everything together, it is a great stepping stone to the next book!	2002-01-30

But when he gets sick with a terrible fever, he finds himself transported into the London in 1599 when the Globe was new and William Shakespeare is alive! <br />It is told in first person through the eyes of the protagonist, Nat, and it tells not only, in detail, about the feelings he gets when he finds out where (or when) he is. It's not just another fall down the rabbit hole type of book, and it's not really fantasy. It describes in rich detail the play company and the city of London in 1599 from the point of view of a young character who has been plagued by death in his life. If you love Shakespeare like I do, you'll absolutely love this book. Even if you don't, you'll still love this book. It was full of meaning, yet the story is layered in a way that can be understood by younger readers as well as on a deeper level by adults.<br />This is a great book and definately worth reading.	2002-01-24

It goes through the period after Joelle's beloved mare Dance Away dies and Joelle turns to almost hating horses, especially Dancer's foal. She and her family, in the mean time, have to keep up their riding stable and help her paralyzed brother, Jeff, go through physical therapy.<br />All in all, it was a good book, however really only satisfying for the younger set. Joelle was fully developed character, however her friends were completely flat, which is typical young girl and horse book. The book tugs at your emotions--if you don't like the way Joelle's treating the filly, that means that the author's done a great job at making those scenes pull at your heartstrings. Good job, definately worth a read.	2002-01-23

After a rocky start, Travis meets a girl named Casey down at his uncle's barn. Casey's got this crazy horse, the Star Runner, that she shows in jumping. <br />I really loved the characters. They were pretty typical S.E. Hinton, which is not bad. They seemed so real, especially the relationship between Travis and Casey. I thought it was really funny, the way that Travis dealt with the horses (and  his comical cat Motorboat). The book was also very serious at times, dealing with a lot of teen issues. I loved the fact that Travis was a writer. All in all, a great book!	2002-01-23

It teaches how to train your racehorses with both the horses and your best interest in mind at the same time. It argues clearly and teaches why the method of not overpushing horses and making them run by masking pain with medicine is stupid and offers viable options for trainers who still want to make money. It teaches that the greatest way to make money is to take care of the horse and let it rest when it needs to be cured for injuries instead of pushing it beyond its limits to eventual permanent lameness. One of my favorite portions was about 'carrotology', which illustrated that even racehorses deserve to be loved like a pleasure horse. This book also gives helpful advise to those not only in Thoroughbred racing, but barrel racing and QH racing. One of the greatest things about this book, though, is the fact that the methods described actually worked for the author. Kudos to Janet.	2002-01-06

They meet in the woods one day and live up to the saying that opposites attract--the kids are complete opposites but take to each other immediately. They meet on accident because they both saw the hart in the bushes and went to look for it. <br />This book is enchanting, however quite short. You could easily read this in less than an hour, but you'll think about it for a long time. The descriptions of the hart and his feelings are great, as well as the sketches of the characters' personalities. Both kids are so 'loud' to the reader despite the length of the book. They are completely developed and well-rounded. Sweet story. A good read.	2001-11-28

I am coming from the perspective of someone who has lived fortunately all my life, and I didn't understand him at first.

Jan Siegel writes intriguingly...there are so many details and the words are so intricate. Each character also has so many different characters in themselves, and I love the feeling I get from the descriptions of their house in Yorkshire. But I picked the book up on what I read on the back, about Atlantis and such. The book, for most of the first half, doesn't mention anything of the sort, although there are slight clues as to the future. I liked the way the book was written, but the plot did not intrigue me. I recommended this book to a fantasy loving friend, and she loved it very much. I like the meanings and descriptions I found in this book, but I have to say I was not blown away.

The book is filled with overbearing descriptions that have little to do with the actual book, and the author rambles on and on about points that just weren't interesting to me. Also, for me, when I read a book, I read it to escape reality, not to bury myself deeper in it, which this book did. I didn't find the plot of it very interesting. I was bored by the time she was ten years old--the characters seemed flat and she jumped from point to point without connecting them.

The sentences are filled with wonderful vocabulary, and it is easy to tell that the book was well thought out, well imagened. I liked many of the ideas, although there are some parts where the writing gets a little bit flat and although there is action, they become uninteresting. <br />Lyra is caught up in something beyond her control, and when her friend is captured, she goes to the North with the gyptians in search of him. She is a spunky girl with a contagious, youthful personality. <br />I thought that the book was interesting, although there are some cliche plot twists, and that anyone who likes fantasy would like this book. 4 stars for a great book!	2001-09-07

I liked the stories of Monty's child hood and of the men not believing him when he 'started' mustangs. I also enjoyed the stories he told of the people he'd met while doing his tours, and I think his training techniques do work well. I think they are fascinating and would like to learn more. <br />I was a bit bothered by the story of Shy Boy, though...no, not if he was a mustang or not, not the chasing (which I did think was a little bit strange), but the challange. I wasn't quite sure that rushing a starting like that just to beat a challange or just to make a TV show was what this type of training is about, nor do I think it was healthy. This is about people and horses, and bettering their relationships. Just my humble opinion<br />If you like horses, I would read this books. The methods described open a door into the horse's mind.	2001-09-02

The stories of the Tudors are SO overdone. But after seeing it countless times, I finally did, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a refreshing look into the emotions of Mary. It was nice not to see her just as someone who killed and opressed people (although when Lady Jane and her husband, Guilford, were in the tower, she recognized that the wants of their parents that had put them into power was by no fault of their own--Jane never wanted to be queen--she said she would let them go provided they convert and forgive them for the rallies against her). The writing was simple, yet powerful, and it was sad how her life just kept taking turns for the worst. I am eager to read the book about Elizabeth, although I would love to see something that isn't about the Tudors--Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry III, who was only 9 when he inherited the throne, Eleanor of Castile and Edward I...there are so many possibilities!	2001-09-01

This was the first book I've bought by Alison Weir, and I'm now sure that I will have to buy her other books. The writing was excellent and highly developed. I was never bored. Even my mom, who has no interest in history whatsoever, read this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. We both learned a lot we never knew.	2001-08-28

I read through it in one swoop, enjoying every minute of it and marvelling at the story. Sure, the story of Seabiscuit himself is very familiar to me, as an extremely avid racing fan, but I learned a million more facts that I never thought I'd know. Not only does Laura Hillenbrand show the trials and tribulations of Seabiscuit and his jockey, but she delves deep into the whole of racing in the 1930's and society as it was in relation to racing. I felt as though, by the end, I knew Seabiscuit as well as I know my own horse...and that I knew everyone associated with him. The writing was never boring...I could never use that word in association with this book. It was truly enchanting, and sometimes so amazing that it was hard to believe it was all true. I recommended this book to all of my friends, even those who aren't in to horses, and they all loved it. If you haven't read this, you're missing an awesome book.	2001-08-28

Pegasus, missing Amy's mother, has started to become listless and ill. Plus, when there's a misunderstanding between Ty and Amy, horses are taken away from Heartland and they are losing money. That is, until a reputable Arabian breeder (or half Arabian breeder, it probably should be, since the horse she brings is palomino) brings a mare who rears and freaks out when people try to saddle her. I thought this book was continuing in the great 'tradition' of the first two. Amy, once again, is a very human character. She has flaws; she loses her temper and she cannot always work miracles. I was happy to see that, for once, join-up wasn't the answer to the mare's problems, and for once, Amy didn't know exactly what to do. I mean, certain tactics don't work for every horse. I like the continuing relationship with Ty...Amy gets mad at him in the beginning and, this time, he isn't so quick to make up with her. In the end, it was very sad, but it was very thought provoking and very good.	2001-08-27

I thought it would be pretty cheesy, like most other horse books for young adults. But not a lot of people call a horse rescue shelter a horse 'sanctuary' and the author does in this book. I was totally blown away by this book. I loved the characters: Amy, Lou, Grandpa, Ty, her mother, Soraya, Scott, and Matt were all so real, along with the horses. I love that the concept of join-up was used in the book. It is something I do with my horse and the horses at the sanctuary every so often, along with other natural horsemanship techniques. I loved the face that they used alternative medicines along with conventional vet skills. And I loved the plot. The death of the mother was handled very well--I thought the dialogue was well thought out, the fighting was not over done, and the emotions were very real. Even my mom read this book and loved it, and she's deathly afraid of horses. I recommend this to everyone!	2001-08-27

I purchased &quot;Squire&quot; as soon as I could, knowing it would be a fantastic book, as Tamora Pierce's always are. I liked a lot of things about the book. For one thing, it was a longer than the others, which left more room for things to happen. It also gets a little bit more realistic as with what Kel has to go through. It isn't just getting bruised on the practice courts anymore. I also liked the aspect of the Chamber of the Ordeal giving Kel visions, and that the Ordeal was far more detailed than in the Alanna books. Kel grows a lot in this book and faces real problems: like the unfairness of the law, death, sex, taking care of a griffin she really doesn't want to take care of, and is reunited with Joren, her former bully. I loved Sir Raoul's return and I enjoyed meeting new characters like Dom and Lerant. There were a few things about the book that I didn't really like: The abscence of Neal was sad, but I could deal with that--this book is supposed to be her life, and in life, things change, people have to move away. I was upset at her growing romance with Cleon. He's a sweet guy but he never really was a developed character--it would have been kind of obvious if Kel hooked up with Neal (but it would have been much appreciated!), so it seemed the right choice to have her pair up with one of Neal's friends. But it seemed as though she didn't really WANT to be with Cleon, almost as though he kind of forced her into it (it probably would have been hard to say no to a sweet guy like him); while she was with him she still had feelings for Dom and Neal. That seemed a little bit weird. Kel had never had the fun-loving relationship with Cleon as she had with Neal, and even Dom. She seemed a little bit dazed when Neal was &quot;going out&quot; with the Yamani lady in waiting. But, who knows? The next book has yet to be published. Also, the characters of Daine and Alanna seem flat, not as they were in their own books. I hate having to wait for the next book, but if Tamora Pierce can write a finishing book as good as this one, I don't care how long it takes! :)	2001-07-08

I received this book for my birthday, being someone who shows dogs, and I've read it four times since. The storyline is original without being too weird and the characters evoke many emotions. Susan Conant writes as though the main character is actually talking to you, not just normal first person, which is refreshing. Although I was sometimes confused by the hints to Sherlock Holmes, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to dog lovers. :)	2001-06-05

Okay, let me say that I don't normally go for these high school love story type of series books, but this one caught my eye. I, myself, don't live in Texas, but I do live on a farm. I can relate to the main character in the story, who also lives on a farm, in that even though she likes farm life, sometimes other people don't and Robin is slightly self concious of that. I also spend most of the year in England, managing to juggle the constant flights between California and the UK, so I felt especailly drawn to this book since it was set there. When I started reading it, I found highly amusing characters and an interesting plot (although it was at times cheesy). Robin's personality is drawn out clearly and with the switch between her point of view and Kit's, you get to know both of them very well. THe writing was witty and engaging, and I'm glad to say it was worth picking up.	2001-05-28

(Willow King 2) (No. 2)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	An all time fave	I read Willow King with excitement, hoping that it would not be like all the other racing books published, in which 13 year olds are racing horses (let's hope this never happens). I was happy to find that it was not, although I thought the role of the trainer of Raging Wind was a little bit of a racing book cliche. Excitedly, I picked up Race the Wind, expecting it to be just like the first book. What I found was one that was much better. Chris Platt has stepped it up a notch with this novel. Katie, Jason, John and King are working towards going to the Kentucky Derby. This book introduces two more characters, as well. Camela, a blind cousin of Cindy's who is deathly afraid of horses and is &quot;dumped&quot; on Katie to entertain. The next is a handsome new jockey called Mark. Katie develops a slight crush for him and Jason of course has something against him. Mark leads them through many adventures and helps teach Katie so that she can get her jockey's license. This book was great--it truly shared the ups and downs of life as a jockey and horse lover. I recommend it to anyone who likes horses.	2001-04-21

This is one of the most emotional Pine Hollow books and I recommend reading it. Bonnie Bryant really knows how to play with your emotions and make you really think about what can happen out of the blue. I had to read this book three times before what happened really sank down into me--I thought, it couldn't be, could it? But maybe so. Any yes, on first page of the book there is no preview for the next book, so I think this must be the last one. You have to read this if you've read the rest of the series.	2001-04-17

Bernard Cornwell shows us many different views on the characters in the tales of King Arthur and it makes you want to just never put the book down and read until you just can't hold yourself up anymore. Although it starts out a little slowly, this story, told in first person by Derfel to Igraine is witty, graphic, and it makes you feel like you're really there. There is romance, war, and political drama weaved into this fantastic tale of history. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2001-02-27

Told in amazing detail by Thea, the main character who is suffering from amnesia, you realize how different two worlds can be for the same person. Intertwined in a mystery of the memories she is having that aren't hers, Thea is challanged with romance and spooks...I was so scared at times and then at other times I just wanted to smile and never stop because it was so good. Margaret Buffie has real talent for developing characters and I could see the house they were living in exactly. The book really brought out my emotions and I would recommend it to anyone! :)	2001-02-27

When I actually read the story I was disappointed. The story was sappy and predictable, and the main character was just the perfect little person---it made me want to throw up. Merod as a character isn't really developed and so the end came at me and I was disapointed because all I had really seen of Merod was an image of a cold kelpie. Fun, light read, but not worth the money.	2000-12-13

Misty Lackey is one of my favourite authors, although sometimes she can have books that are really bad, but makes up for that when she writes excellent ones like By the Sword. Kerowyn, the main character is a likeable girl who has a strong personality. THis 492 page book chronicles her life since the death of her parents at 14 to her being involved in romance, war, and strategy when she is older. I think this book is a classic that I would recommend to people who love a good fantasy and a story about a strong minded girl. Although some of it is sad because you might not like some of the decisions Kero makes, this is an excellent book, and I don't think any other Lackey books can top it.	2000-12-13

I picked up this book expecting to find some boring interpretation of early Britain as I thought that all of these types of books would be. But I was really interested in the subject matter-----and this book made me even more interested. I was introduced to stories I'd never heard before and the book was easy to read for me (I'm in high school). I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend this book to anyone interested in early Britain. It offers many different perspectives of the legends while analyzing The History of the Kings of Britain by Geoffrey of Monmouth. &quot;Excellent&quot; isn't even near enough to say!	2000-12-08

It was hard to read, boring, and I couldn't understand it. Now in high school, with interest in British history, I came across the tale of King Lear in another book, and decided that if it was really going to make much sense that I would have to read King Lear by Shakespeare. So, I did...and I LOVED it...when I put my mind to it, I could understand it, and I found it a great tale told by a great writer. A+!	2000-12-06

Centred around Merlin, the seris starts long before Arthur is even born, following the 'adventures' of young Merlin.

I was hooked immediately as I could relate to the main character and her relationship with horses. The characters are all strong and have their own way to them, and the plots are excellent, but the reason I knocked off a star on this book was because of two things: --It can get really dippy/cheesy at points --length...as this is a YA book they can't be more that 250 pages, and although I know the author is annoyed she can't make them longer, I like to continue with a book that's long when I like it. <br />Recommended YA book.

I actually thought this book was pretty good---excepting themistakes, it's a nice story---.<br />I used to love these books a tonwhen I was like seven, but I grew out of that and began to get involved in horse racing ...real horse racing...where you DON'T win the Kentucky Derby/Triple Crown/Breeder's Cup EVERY year with a horse an all its sons, grandsons, and great grandsons. I mean, there were good producers and are good producers, but I have yet to see horses like that!<br />Well, that's beside the point...  I thought the writing in this book was very good, even if it wasn't about racing and there were mistakes. The author really knows how to tweak your emotions and I hope they use her more! Although the back of the book was a little far fetched, I thought Lyssa was cool and that the characters were very real, especially Foxy, and usually the horses don't have much a personality.

For ages I had always heard about Kate Elliott's books and I had never read them...but one day I just HAD to pick up King's Dragon because I felt compelled to read it. Boy was I right! I finished the book in about a day,  while at the same time traveling back and forth from London.<br />I  immediately clicked the the first two main characters: Liath and Alain.  They both had very human wants and needs and more importantly, emotions.  <br />I think that Kate Elliott is one of the best character developers out  there (yes, I think these are better than Harry Potter, you just have to be  up to reading thick novels with political conflict, etc). Liath, who was  &quot;stolen&quot; by an evil man called Hugh, was then abused and raped.  Usually, in fantasy books, the enemy is very flat: dark side, evil magic,  etc...while Hugh could be a person walking (or riding) down the road like  anyone else, etc. He was very real and more than once I could not figure  out how Liath was going to get out of the situations she was in. <br />Filled  with court drama, awesome characters, and romance, this seris is one of the  best out there.	2000-07-11

Arrows of the Queen is, I think, one of the best Mercedes Lackey books. Talia, the main character, is not any superhero or bigshot, but a shy girl who is thrust into a completely knew life. This story, and the other two in  the seris, Arrow's Flight and Arrow's Fall, touched me to the point of  crying from sadness and joy. These are inspiring tales of true heros and  best friends thatI recommend anyone, no matter what age, read.	2000-05-13
