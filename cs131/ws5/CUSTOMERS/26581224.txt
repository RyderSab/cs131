I have read lots of books about Angels and THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ANGELS is, by far, the most accurate and complete reference about angels in our world. Not only it answered all of my questions but also gave me much more information that I could ever have asked for.    I can tell you, there are lots of great works out there that compile information from different old sources but they are very confusing. Different sources says different things about the same angel, the same feat is assigned to different angels, one source points one angel as of light while other source points the same angel as fallen, etc. This encyclopedia clarifies those confusions and shed light on questions that were a mystery for ages.    The book has valuable in-depth information, available for the very first time. Also hundreds of angel names with complete profiles of most of them. Each profile has things such as:    -The clairvoyant physical description of the angel.  -Description on each angel feats and history (with clarifications of the centuries-old misinterpretations).  -The angel's date of birth and age (calculated according with our solar calendar).  -The different names the same angel was called by different cultures and in different periods.  -Correct hierarchic ranks.  -The hosts and number of legions of high-ranked angels.  -His/her patronage.  -Authentic descriptions and pictures of the angels family seal.  -Gorgeous portraits depicted from visions and apparitions.      All the elements mentioned above make this book unique, but the portraits deserve special consideration. They were portrayed by the author from clairvoyant visions and apparitions, so they contain the exact likeness of each angel. When I looked at each one of them and realized that I had in front of me the real image of an Angel, I was filled up with inspiration and enlightenment. If I ever see one of those Angels appear in front of me, I will be able to recognize him/her!    Up to this point, you will feel amazed, but there is a breathtaking surprise at the Appendix, waiting to be discovered: Samples of psychowritten scrolls with the Angel's own handwriting. That is very exciting!    This book brings so much Light and awareness, that, just to open it, will make you feel much closer and connected to Heaven, and I dare to affirm that it is not only a feeling but a reality.     I widely recommend it. It is a book that I already keep as one of my most precious treasures.	2005-02-09
