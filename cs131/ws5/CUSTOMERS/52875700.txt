This book is a wonderful way to get children caught up in the excitement and tension of a classical tale, while also giving them a resourceful and modern heroine to admire.  The book is everything a children's story should be: it's funny, the languish reads well and beautifully, and the illustrations are well done.  This is a must-have.	2002-05-31

If you've ever wondered what a &quot;hardshell&quot; baptist was, or what made &quot;primitive baptists&quot; different, this is the book for you. In addition, McBeth does an excellent job of helping baptists to understand how our own theological journey connects with that of the larger Christian church.	2001-08-28

Although the story line is engrossing, the  characters are just a little too stereotypical and the theology/magic  system a tad too clich&eacute;d.  The ending, likewise, is somewhat predictable  and pat.<br />Were it most other author, this book would have received 3  stars.  Nevertheless, the Bradley touches (particularly the emphasisi on  the female characters) are sufficient to make this a respectable read for  anyone who enjoys the genre.  As always, Bradley manages to make you want  to read to the end; even if you are pretty what that will be.	2000-08-24

Every word, pause, and action is (or should be) intentional and holy.  Dawn invites the reader into (an  admittedly one-sided conversation) that reminds the reader of the  sacredness of a gathered community of faith; and persuasively argues for  the preservation of the rich tradition of Christian worship.<br />Passionate  proponents of &quot;contemporary&quot; worship will at the very least find  points of disagreement.  In fact, they may very well be offended.  Nevertheless, this excellent book is a much needed and well-researched  counter to the current trend towards assuming that traditional worship has  no connection or meaning to contemporary culture.<br />I highly recommend this  book to anyone planning, contemplating, or participating in Christian  worship in any form or denominational tradition.  Warning: It may very well  change things you have believed for a long time.	2000-08-15

The articles started my love affair with the discipline; a tumultuous relationship that has caused me to completely  redefine my graduate interests.<br />Composition theory has evolved through a  number of distinct stages over the past few decades; and Villanueva has  effectively zeroed in on the key figures and key articles from each period.  If you are new to composition theory, these essays will provide you with a  solid roadmap through the landscape of rhetorical theory.<br />If you've  been down that road a few times; Villanueva's resource is an excellent  refresher course.  The editorial choices do not seem to reflect any  particular bias.  The essays themselves represent many different sides of  each school of thought; and are the authors' own words.  It is left to the  reader then to sift through the particular biases and assumtions of each  school of thought.<br />This book has my highest recommendation for anyone  with any interest in the field.  For all but the most sagacious, I would  consider it a must-have.	2000-07-22

Silverberg does an outstanding job of making historical personages come alive in such a way  that, when you encounter oblique references to them in later novels you  feel as if someone has just mentioned an old friend.<br />In addition,  Silverberg takes you behind the scenes at some of the pivotal moments in  Majipoor's past.  He crafts those events with insight and cleverness (and  throws in a few surprises).  The complicated and seductive world of  Majipoor is even more so after the glimpses which Silverberg  offers.<br />Every story in this collection would stand alone as an enjoyable  and thought-provoking reading experience.

In this first novel set in that world (with a  Science Fiction History but an essentially Fantasy present); Silverberg  takes you on an exciting, fast-paced trek through its diverse  environs.<br />Although only Valentine is well-developed, the characters are  certainly sympathetic and the storyline is quite engrossing.  The sheer  diversity of the planet, and the thoughtful way in which Silverberg has  layed out the planet's history and social geography, make this a fun and  thought-provoking read.<br />If they are not there already, _Lord Valentine's  Castle_ and the world of Majipoor are destined for &quot;classic&quot;  status.  It is deserved.  They are both well worth the time that you will  spend exploring them.	2000-07-15

Then imagine someone taking a picture of it.  The first person who sees the picture holds tracing paper over it and traces the outline of the visible side of  the sculpture.  Realizing that what they have is only a pale imitation of  the original, the sketcher throws their work onto the ground, where the  image becomes partially obscured by mud.  A passerby takes a polaroid of  that partially obscured sketch.<br />If the rich tradition of Jewish and  Christian prophecy is the sculpture, then LaHaye and Jenkins' book is the  polaroid.<br />Speaking as a Christian clergyman, the theology and biblical  interpretation in _Left Behind_ is infantile and absurd.  Speaking as a  lover of books, the characterization is so limp and one-dimensional that it  was a chore to keep reading.<br />_Left Behind_ is an excellent propoganda  tool for those who wish to turn Christianity into the kind of self-serving,  ignorant, spiritually bankrupt institution that it is portrayed to be in  the media.  It is also an excellent tool for convincing people to read the  powerful and mysterious texts of the Bible as if they were a contemporary  (bad) novel.<br />If you are a Christian (or interested in Christianity); do  not go near this book. Please, Please, PLEASE seek out reliable, scholarly  commentaries on Revelation (such as the one in the New Interpreter's Bible  series).<br />If you are looking for an engrossing, clever, &quot;what  if?&quot; novel; look elsewhere.	2000-07-15

Scroggs does an excellent job of introducing the reader to basic prinicples  of biblical interpretation and then applying those principles to the (very  few) verses that seem to address homosexuality.<br /><br />If you have any biblical  questions on this issue, this is the book to start with.  It's starting to get a bit dated now, but it is still a great way to grasp the basic concept that the biblical writers were not addressing the issue of loving, consensual, monogamous, healthy relationships between adults of the same sex.	2000-06-11

The stories are well-written and delightful; and often provide a new spin on a familiar tale.  Excerpted (and cited, of course) they make excellent anecdotes.  Woven together, they provide a sense of the rich and vivid tapestry that  comprises Jewish folktales.  Sometimes irreverent, sometimes poignant, and  always real; there is something for everyone here.	2000-06-11

I first encountered _The Openness of God_ in  seminary, and have since referred to it on several occasions as I have  sought cogent explanations for reconciling some of the tougher issues of  faith.<br /><br />I doubt that you will find much in common with the book if you are  a fundamentalist or \\"conservative evangelical\\" Christian; but I  do not think that this is its target audience.  For the educated,  questioning, perhaps believer; however, this is an excellent choice.	2000-06-11

Its most stunning quality is its clever, complex, and detailed look at first contact and the intricacies of a truly alien civilization.  In addition, the  carefully crafted characterization drew me in immediately.  I found that I  came to care very deeply for the characters, and I took their pains and  tribulations quite personally.<br />This is well-thought-out, well-written  science fiction at its best.	2000-06-11

This popular literary device permeates the fourth  gospel, and is fundamental to the dualistic themes found throughout the  work. Dr. Duke's research provides an essential schematic whereby the  novice or the scholar can navigate the complexities of this gospel. Dr.  Duke looks at the book with the eye of a trained scholar and the heart of a  lyrical poet.	2000-06-11

The emotions that this book arouses are so powerful (and  sometimes painful) that you may only want to take it in small doses.  Whatever your pace, however, I think that you will find the journey  worthwhile.<br /><br />One approach to spirituality that is often associated with the feminist movement is an emphasis  on the personal.  Unsurprisingly, then, Kidd takes us on HER journey rather  then that of a more abstract and impersonal third person.  In connecting  Kidd's story to my own, I found a kind of hope and encouragement that can  only come from meeting a kindred spirit on a long road.<br /><br />Man or woman,  your or old, this book is a must-have.  It will challenge you, make you  angry, and open up new worlds for you - if you let it.	2000-06-11

It's a tough question.  Three years of rigorous Christian seminary is still not enough to convince me that they go to Hell.  It's nice to know that Knitter and Hick feel the same way.  If you are looking for a cogent,  scholarly approach to the kind of pluralism that most of us accept  logically but have trouble defending theologically, this is the book to  buy.  In addition, its bibliography is outstanding.	2000-06-11

In his preface, Crossan clearly outlines the assumptions that  undergird his understanding of both; and I would caution any reader to keep  those assumptions in mind.  Taking that caveat into account, however, this  is a brilliant magnum opus by an outstanding scholar; but one that will  take considerable effort for someone not already familiar with the field to  understand.	2000-06-11

Sometimes the logic seems a bit slippery and the characters a little flat; but the main character is sufficiently sympathetic to guide you  through the book.  If you are looking for a &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi account  of first contact, try _A Deepness in the Sky_.  If you want more of a noir  detective novel on the same topic; this is the book for you.	2000-06-11
