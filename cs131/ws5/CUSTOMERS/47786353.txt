If you're hoping to find an explanation for what the Night Stone is exactly, then you should hope for a sequel.<br />The main character, I've already blocked out his name, is a shop teacher who has just moved his wife and 13-year old kid into a new town and a new house that was owned by his grandmother.  Now immediately their kid starts to act weird and carry around this wooden doll she found in the house, not that the parents noticed.  The dad is too obsessed with digging up these stones sticking up out of the back yard, ala King's The Tommyknockers, and the wife is too obsessed with finding a job to get her out of the house and away from the family.  The kid, well she's obsessed with horses, oh and a little on the possessed side with whatever the spirit of that wooden doll is.  Don't expect to find that out either.  Everything bizarre that happens to the dad, like seeing his daughter fly through the air in her P.J.'s, he convinces himself that it was just a dream. Sure. I've had dreams like that too, but they were almost always chemically induced.  The mom simply decides to ignore her experiences. Yeah, that's a great dramatic tool.<br />Though there was some intrigue to the story and the haunting, the characters were just so unlikeable that I didn't care.  And just for good measure, the writer threw in some vague pedophilic reference in the beginning that had me waiting for the other shoe to drop and being suspect of the dad throughout.  H-Whaaa???	2002-11-07

The premise was sooo interesting:  In the early 1900's, a man and a girl commit suicide under very mysterious circumstances at a remote beach house.  In the present day, which happens to be the 80's, two women and their teenaged children rent the house and weird things start to happen.<br />This should have really held my interest, but it didn't. The characters were agonizingly dull, their reactions frustrating, there was no sense of pacing or heigtened suspense.  It took me about a month to get through it, I kept putting it down to read other things...like cereal boxes, War & Peace, etc.	2002-11-06

A mad scientist teams up with a greedy conglomerate to create an indestructible killing species via recombinant DNA experimentation.  They unleash and test these \\"Spawn of Hell\\" on unsuspecting small town residents.  These beings are butt-ugly gruesome, have a real taste for human flesh and there's an interesting twist in their make-up.  Horror fans will be thrilled.<br />The main character, David Hammond, is a down on his luck, 30-something artist still hoping for his big break. He's a dark but interesting and likeable character, however, his pairing with Anna Braddon hit a real sour note for me.  The passages focusing on their relationship brings the story to a complete standstill.  Anna, a supermodel no less, just does not exhibit any qualities (besides her appearance) that would explain David's fierce attraction to her. She is a badly drawn character, which prevented me from rating the book as five-star excellent. Otherwise it's an originally executed, fun, fast read.	2002-10-02

So hunky that even men have fallen in love with him, Native Canadian Sam Hunting Wolf is in denial about his Indian heritage.  Nevertheless, he is a powerful shaman whose spirit and energy is being used by a malevolent force known as \\"The Trickster\\" to slaughter his way through the small ski town of Silver.  Sam's got to get in touch with his roots fast, before he's the only one left to ski those slopes.<br />Muriel Gray is a wonderful addition to the horror genre. I also enjoyed her \\"Furnace.\\"  But here she's written a fast paced, engaging story with characters you really care about. The origin and reason for the Trickster's resurfacing is a bit muddled, but otherwise this was a fun book.<br />As to the above title, the Trickster possesses animals in order to do his stalking, which makes for some really spooky scenes.  When kitty starts using some very bad language it's time to leave the house!	2002-09-10

I felt like I was trying to finish a 7 pound steak.  Sure it's delicious, but after awhile you just get tired of chewing.  Appearantly King never wrote a word he didn't like.  It took him four years to finish IT and I respect that, but I don't think anything would have been lost by omitting some passages.  Secondly, I was uncomfortable with the mature depiction of love and sexuality in his eleven-year old protagonists. I just kept wishing he had placed them in their teens.  Lastly, IT in it's pseudo-true form was a bit anti-climactic for me.	2002-08-29

A young actress is invited to study privately with her idol, an older actress who mysteriously fell out of the public eye. Well, the older actress turns out to be a homicidal maniac and imprisons the younger actress in the home.  What follows is a tense, exciting adventure as the younger actress fights to win her freedom and save her life.<br />Since it was some time ago that I read the book and it is in storage, I can give you no names.  And I don't recall the motivation of the older actress.	2002-08-29

It's actually more cerebral than what is described.  The term \\"Wetbones\\" doesn't even appear until halfway through the book.<br />The basic premise of the story is this; the pleasure we derive from our addictions are controlled by these invisible demons called the \\"Akishra,\\" who feed off the energy. Now the trouble begins when a few people attempt to summon and manipulate the Akishra for their own nefarious purposes. The Akishra become more powerful, more hungry and are able to influence us rather than just feed off of us.  Worse yet, conditions are ripe for them to reproduce, so if you think the world is in the toilet now, buckle your seatbelts!<br />My only problem with the Akishra and the whole concept, is that it really raises more questions and issues than the book has time to address. However, the characters and their relationships were the real heart of the story.  Shirley creates some really believable and unique protagonists. One becomes completly wrapped up in the fates of these people, so much so that the book becomes hard to put down. Lastly, there is plenty of blood, sex and gore to balance the thought-provoking plot.	2002-08-29

The FBI is sent to the little town of Crystal Wells to investigate, but some members have their own agenda. Local resident and snow tractor driver, Morgan Blaylock, stumbles upon the truth and must battle both the creatures and rogue agent, Richard Case. Case wants to cover up the killings and capture the creatures for his own profit.<br />I gave the book an extra star for the concept of the creatures. They are unique AND bloodthirsty!  It would have been a great monster story, but the plot holes and foibles just got bigger and more distracting as the story progressed. But there is a lot of good action and it's a fast moving story.	2002-08-29

The basic premise was intriguing, some monster or being is attacking first animals then humans leaving nothing but film-covered bones.  It seems to be able to get into locked rooms, and the victims are anesthetized by the use of powerful pheromones. The pheromones incite an orgasmic reaction rendering the victims helpless. The creature is nicknamed \\"firefly,\\" as its digestive methods mimic that of the insect.<br />Except for the beginning and the rap-up at the end, Piers seems to forget about the firefly and concentrates on the four protagonists.  The characters are interesting and unique but the dialogue is so unbelievably wooden.  It's as if someone unfamiliar with the language wrote it.  There is a noticeable lack of contractions at times.  Also..., answers do just seem to fall into the character's laps.  One of the them, Oenone (Ee-no-nee), is a storyteller and much of the book gives over to her various tales.  Actually the whole book reads like a modern day fairytale.  I can't say that I thoroughly enjoyed it or actively disliked it, but it would serve as an excellent conversation piece if read in a book club.  There are many controversial issues explored such as domestic abuse and pedophilia.	2002-08-23

Well it's not your typical \\"evil doll\\" tale, where it becomes animated and starts chasing people around with sharp knives. (As the cover would have you believe) Rather the story focuses on ten year-old twin girls, one good and one evil, this IS still a horror story after all.<br />The doll is manufactured in one of those Cabbage Patch hospitals reminiscent of the 80's. For some reason there is a separate division, this was a very weak part of the story, in which the \\"dollmaker\\" an Incan priestess, manufactures her own special dolls and imbues them with certain powers. They have the ability to achieve the owner's deepest desires. So before you can say \\"Chuckie Rules,\\" the doll falls into the eager hands of the evil twin who uses it to make her sister's life miserable...even unto death!<br />\\"The Doll\\" was such an enjoyable, quick read that I can forgive the underdeveloped \\"dollmaker\\" character.	2002-08-19

A horny teenager is marooned on a seemingly deserted island with 3 beautiful women.  Things go awry as they are targeted by a madman and his wife who wish to satisfy their depraved lusts with the women and kill off the young man.  At first the constant and at times inappropriate sexual musings of the youth is hilarious, but as the book takes a darker turn it becomes downright creepy.<br />I don't think the story was well served by making it a \\"journal\\" of the boy's experiences.  I was distracted every time he wrote about the rudimentary necessities of keeping up the journal; like running out of paper.  It also rang false that anyone, much less this character, would keep such a detailed record of thoughts and conversation in the midst of such mayhem.<br />I rated the novel three stars because it is indeed a page-turner but the book should have ended about half way through. The plot and the dialogue disintegrates (particularly between the two teenaged girls who have been repeatedly abused), and the action becomes increasingly preposterous all leading to an appalling ending.	2002-08-13

They are doomed to \\"lead lives of quiet desperation,\\" never becoming truly successful at anything. In the family manse \\"Sweet Gum,\\" the spirit of one dead bloodsucker kin infects a male Tracker and for some reason they can only feed off of one another.  So the vampire Trackers run around trying to recruit the non-vampire Trackers as they pass up some choice locals, who seem to dissapear midway through the book.<br />I was turned off by the incestual tone throughout the story, for Pete's sake the main character was in love with his neice!  No matter how pretty a bow the author tried to slap on that package, I still couldn't get past it.  Aside from the endearing character of the dwarf-child Emily, there was really no one to rally behind.  Kudos to Gresham though for making the chief vampire, Franklin, homosexual; in his former life Franklin never followed the conventions of society, so he set his own rules as a vampire, like walking by day. That was original.<br />The action was mostly very contrived and implausible, the heros and villains each making dumb choices simply to advance the plot.  Despite an interesting premise, the novel never succeeds in completely pulling you in.	2002-08-13

The relic acts as a magnet to restless spirits, drawing them forth and increasing their powers.  The entities violently attack and terrorize residents of the town and it is up to Jon Hammond, publisher and owner of the local newspaper, to save the day.<br />It's a well-written, fast paced story with some refreshing departures from the standard horror formula.  First, \\"the relic\\" which is concealed in a locked, metal box, and the explanation for its existence is quite clever and will surprise you.  Secondly, there's none of the tedium of convincing non-believers that there's supernatural activity going on.  Everyone in the book is pretty smart, they can see that what's going on has no logical explanation other than the paranormal.  Lastly, the events of the town are not kept secret, it does reach the media and the rest of the world.<br />I borrowed this book from the library, and the picture on the jacket cover features a skull on a black background, with red nazi insignias filling the eye sockets.	2002-08-07

David Ash is a paranormal investigator haunted by the childhood death of his sister, he finds escape at the bottom of a bottle.  David is sent to debunk the claims of a haunting at the estate of the mysterious Mariell family. While there he is forced to confront his own demons while battling malevolent manifestations in the home.  This character also appears in Herbert's \\"Ghosts of Sleath.\\"<br />Well if you've seen \\"The Sixth Sense\\" or \\"The Others,\\" (Not Herbert's \\"Others) you pretty much know what's coming by the first few pages. Unfortunately, the element of surprise is the entire foundation of the book, it's what the suspense is building to. With that gone, there are no engaging characters, no sense of atmosphere, nothing to really hold the interest. Worst yet, when David falls in love it annoyed me, as there seemed no basis for it except to up the stakes for the \\"surprise\\" ending.	2002-07-31

But unlike Little's couple, I have to give this couple credit for at least attempting to help the poor schulbs next door before everything goes terribly wrong.<br />\\"The House Next Door\\" starts off with typical horror genre elements; as the new house goes up animals are mysteriously killed and mutilated. But after that the book branches off into daytime television shenanigans; we've got cheating spouses, abused housewives, people who are driven insane, not to mention disastrous housewarming parties. These are the events that occur after each family moves in, 3 in all. Suddenly the \\"horror\\" becomes something vague and esoteric. To my chagrin, just when the couple puts down the chardonnay bottle and decide to take some drastic action, the novel ends! Personally, I believe the writer dealt too much with the dull day to day activities of this bourgeois couple and not enough on The House Next Door.	2002-07-30
