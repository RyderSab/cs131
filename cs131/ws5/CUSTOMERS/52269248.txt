She must truly have a wonderful sense of humor.  I have always loved her book \\"Cloe and Maude\\" and now that I am a mother I have discovered her books anew.  I found \\"But Not the Hippopotamus\\" in the grocery store - it made me laugh out loud right there in the baby aisle.  I had to buy two - one for my daughter (who is 5 months and loves it) and one for my best friend who is due with her first child in September.  This book has such a great rhythm to it and the ending is too cute!  Of course Boynton's drawings, as always, are adorable and full of personality.  I think I have just about all of her books on my wish list!  Really a must for the night-night library of a young baby.  I never get tired of reading it.	2004-05-30

They arrived today and I was a little surprised by how small they were but I figured they were still good for my purposes.  I have a newborn daughter (3 weeks old) and would like to start reading to her at bedtime.  Most of the books I have are way too old for a little baby (better for 2 to 4 year olds).  Board books seem to be much more appropriate.  At any rate, these books are recommended for 1 month and up.  Like I mentioned my daughter is only nearly 3 weeks old, and I doubt if she really understood at all what was going on or was able to focus on the pictures, but the fact that I was reading to her was soothing enough to put her to sleep.  These books are an excellent way to start the habit of reading to your child at night.	2004-01-18

And I'll admit I originally ordered this book mainly out of curiosity.  I was not disappointed though.  It arrived today and the illustrations are gorgeous (though the book doesn't seem to give any credit to the illustrator - which I thought was odd - leading most to assume that Madonnna illustrated it, which she did not apparently).  They story has a very nice moral of overcoming jealousy.  It teaches not to judge others before knowing them - or walking a mile in their shoes.  And it also celebrates the value of female friendship.  It know when I was a little girl, my friends were everything - and many of them still are, nearly 30 years later!  I'm sure that when she is old enough, my daughter will enjoy this book too - and my six year old niece is now going to get it for Christmas!  The writing style is very personable and engaging.  I'm not sure why but it reminded me a little of Eloise.  If you're considering this book for the curiosity factor, don't hesitate to buy it any longer - it is worth it.	2003-09-17

I absolutely love this book.  And I recommend it to everyone I know who is pregnant as well.  This is my first child and I found What To Expect When You're Expecting a little bit lacking.  My husband and I read this journal together every night - it has really added a wonderful bond during this pregnancy.  Recently we've started reading it to the baby as well (we have a special microphone that attaches to my belly) and so the baby gets to hear Daddy's voice every night too.  No, there is not a lot of room to write and some of the information can feel redundant, but all in all it is exactly what it says it is.  It gives you just enough info to feel like you understand what is happening with your baby and your body every day.  And it tells you things your doctor is likely to leave out.  There is a place to keep track of both your weight and your waist size which is convenient when you're looking back trying to see how much you've grown.  And I personally don't want to write a whole lot in this journal and it gives just enough room to write the necessities.  I plan to show this book to my baby one day so I don't want all the ultra private thoughts in there.  I leave that for the blank book that serves as my personal journal.	2003-07-27

It is very behind the times as far as what is currently going on on the show in Great Britain but it is a bit ahead from where I am in Central New York.  Because of that I currently know a little more than I should about what is going to happen - and although that is kind of fun, it's a little disappointing too because I won't be surprised.  However, I just loved reading this book - couldn't put it down.  It gives you so much information on all &quot;current&quot; characters (at least from where I'm watching - it seems to be current through at least the beginning of 2000) and has a section about all of the old characters too (many of whom I really miss!).  Anyway, if you're an EastEnders fan or someone who has just started to watch and is a bit confused, this is a great resource for you!  Thoroughly enjoyable.	2002-09-20

Not only are the Angelina Ballerina books wonderful - all about a very strong willed little girl/mouse who lives out her dreams and learns many a good lesson in the process - but the Angelina Ballerina dolls (that are made by the American Girl Company) are equally as fabulous.  I bought this set for my 3-year-old niece and I hope to add to her collection of both Angelina books and accessories for years to come.  There is a book for every occasion (Christmas, birthdays, new siblings, new friends, school) and accessories for the doll to coordinate.  There are also dolls for Angelina's little sister, her cousin and her best friend Alice.  Plus tons of clothes, furniture and other fun stuff!

You are transported back to an earlier time and really made to remember what it was to be a child - especially a child in a dysfunctional family.  Lynda Barry's comics touch upon some of the sadder moments of childhood and dysfunction without losing their comic and ironic edge.  They allow you to laugh without getting bogged down in the misery.  They allow you to understand the pain without forgetting to enjoy the little things.  This is truly a work of comic art.  Lynda Barry is one of the best comic artists of our time.	2002-01-04

I was recommended this book by a friend who had recently conceived after trying unsuccessfully for several years.  I have been trying to get pregnant for several months myself without any luck.  Anyone who has been through unsuccessful conception attempts knows how stressed out every little &quot;sign&quot; or &quot;symptom&quot; can make you!  This book is SO wonderful and I have only gotten through the first few chapters.  It really helps to understand the female body and menstrual system.  It's just amazing.  I have believed for so long that I was unusual and now find that I am not.  I think this book will make me both a happier and healthier person - and I hope that it will help make me a mother finally as well.  You don't need to be trying to get pregnant to necessitate buying this book.  It's important information for EVERY woman.  It talks about birth control, menopause, EVERYTHING!  Knowledge gives us power!  Lets take control of our own bodies and stop relying on doctors who do not know what it actually feels like to be inside our skins.	2001-08-09

There is another book that is supposedly the best for Paperclay - &quot;Sculpting Doll in Paperclay&quot; by Robert McKinley but it's sold out and difficult to find - so I opted for this one. I found this book to be fairly similar in techinique to many other dollmaking books in other media. There wasn't all that much that made it stand apart. I guess if you're very interested in Paper MacHe, then this is the book for you.  If you're wanting to learn more about Paperclay techniques, skip this book and look for the one by McKinley instead.	2001-07-21

I agree with the previous reviewer - this is definitely a better book for people making porcelain dolls than dolls from polyclay. I am fairly disappointed and still have a lot of questions. However, it was very helpful regarding sculpting over an armature and gave me some what of an idea of how to then proceed to make a mold from my polyclay piece. I also have Rotraut Schrott's book and I honestly don't find that one all that much more helpful for my purposes. I am really trying to figure out joints and making mold at this point and I am having a difficult time finding a book that will help me as they are all geared towards porcelain. And the polyclay books all assume you are making one of a kind dolls. The pictures are good in this book though and I feel I have a little more grasp on what I'm shooting for now - so I give it 3 stars which to me means average. I wish I had thought twice before buying it. There must be a better book out there.	2001-07-17

This book goes into depth about accessorizing dolls and has great illustrations for making shoes, for fitting costumes to dolls, for creating doll-sized animals, etc.  It's fantastic and very easy to follow.

I bought this book looking for readings for my April wedding.  I did end up using a passage from Buddha that I found in this book but overall I was unimpressed with the book.  I had a really difficult time finding anything short enough to suit my purposes but not too short or too hokey.  Specifically I was looking for something that two people could read together and I found it really difficult to find anything of that type.  I ended up using something else from a different book of poetry.  Many of the longer readings were very nice but too long or too complicated to ask someone to read at our wedding.  This book also did not help either my husband or myself when writing our own vows.  All in all I could have probably done without this book but I give it 3 stars because it is not a badly put together book - but perhaps just not what *I* was looking for.	2001-07-08

This may not have been one of Sharyn McCrumb's best books but I personally found it entirely enjoyable and easy to read.  And I couldn't put it down.  It's not a nail-biting thriller of a mystery like some of her other books, but I still found it very good.  I actually enjoyed seeing Elizabeth mourn the loss of her husband - she seemed a little more human and less irritating than I have tended to find her in the past.  I look forward to the next Elizabeth McPherson mystery - and I wonder if Bill and A.P. will ever get together...  At any rate, bottom line, if you are looking for a hard core mystery novel, you are going to be disappointed (I'd hazard a guess that you'd be happier with the newest Ballad mystery by McCrumb set to come out this month).  If you're looking for a novel wherein Elizabeth actively solves a mystery, you're going to be disappointed.  But if you just are looking for an entertaining book about characters you already know and love with a wonderfully feminist slant, you'll thoroughly enjoy this book.	2001-05-21

It is not so much a &quot;how-to&quot; book as it is an illustrated diary of the artist's amazing process.  This particular sculptor sculpts the entire skeleton, muscular system out to the finished sculpture you see on the front of the book.  It's amazing but a little more detailed than I believe a beginner such as myself needs - I was a little daunted by the entire process but also quite in awe.  The photographs are tremendous.

However, many of the techniques are very good and insightful and I will  definitely look back on this book once I figure out how to get my molds  created.

While I enjoyed this book, I found myself bored through a great deal of the historical sections.  This book was much more historical and less &quot;mysterious&quot; than Sharyn McCrumb's other ballad mysteries.  Many  of the below reviews seem to have been written by people who have never  read the ballad mysteries, and so it would make sense that they would give  this a bad review since they don't understand what they're supposed to be  about.  Our favorite psychic, Nora Bonesteel, doesn't play as large a part  in this one as she does in some of the others (with the exception of Pretty  Peggy-O).  The best place to start in the ballad mysteries would be the  middle three books of the five.  And they are DEFINITELY worth the read -  especially if you love ghosts, backwoods family history and spirituality  and a touch of historical ballads.

While I enjoyed this book, I found myself bored through a great deal of the historical sections.  This book was much more historical and less &quot;mysterious&quot; than Sharyn McCrumb's other ballad mysteries.  Many  of the below reviews seem to have been written by people who have never  read the ballad mysteries, and so it would make sense that they would give  this a bad review since they don't understand what they're supposed to be  about.  Our favorite psychic, Nora Bonesteel, doesn't play as large a part  in this one as she does in some of the others (with the exception of Pretty  Peggy-O).  The best place to start in the ballad mysteries would be the  middle three books of the five.  And they are DEFINITELY worth the read -  especially if you love ghosts, backwoods family history and spirituality  and a touch of historical ballads.  Read this one last if you must read it  but don't expect the same type of book.	2000-03-08

This book is definitely a &quot;thinking book&quot; and may be too much for the younger kiddies.  However, as a grown up fan of Eloise - I grew up loving the original Eloise book - I have to say that this book is a must  have if you love Eloise!  I definitely liked this book better than Eloise  in Paris.  It really captures the feelings of the Cold War age and makes me  try to picture Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight's actual trip.  Kay Thompson  sounds like she must've been an amazing individual.  This book is  especially valuable on a pseudo-historical level.  VERY enjoyable.  Beautiful art work as usual!  Say YES YES YES to Eloise - she's simply  marvelous!	2000-03-02

I read Eloise over and over again when I was just a wild little  girl myself, but I never knew the other Eloise books existed.  I recently  bought Eloise in Paris and now Eloise at Christmastime - which was  definitely worth the wait.  Now we just need Eloise in Moscow rereleased  and we'll be all set...	1999-10-29

After Crazy Ladies, I couldn't imagine how Michael Lee West could do any better - but OH MY GOD!  Did she ever!  She Flew The Coop is an amazing book filled with amazing yet believable characters.  And while the bulk of  the book deals with tragedy and pain, it's truly a tribute to the strength  of the human spirit and the silver lining behind every storm cloud in life.  After this book I decided to read another author's book instead of  American Pie by Michael Lee West (just to give myself a break and something  to look forward to) but I couldn't sit through the other book just knowing  I had another Michael Lee West sitting on my shelf!  She is truly one the  great contemporary authors!	1999-04-19

I put it down and picked it up at least a dozen times (still trying to finish it and over half way through).  The main character is SO HORRENDOUS!  She makes me insane.  You know, I've  loved books about unsympathetic crazy people in the past, but this one  misses the mark.  Maybe they've got to be written by women to make that  emotional connection.  It wasn't that Wally Lamb's writing style was bad  even.  He's a very good writer - it's the people he chooses to create that  are so miserable.	1999-04-19

This was one of my favorite books as a child - I used to listen to the record (read by Ray Bolger) over and over again.  L. Frank Baum out does himself in this one.  It is every bit as good as all of the Wizard of Oz  books he also penned.  Truly magnificent!  Read this one to your kids (or  just to yourself)!	1999-04-19

I read this a while ago and have given it to everyone I know to read since.  What a gem!  Of course anything Michael Lee West writes is GOLD!  Like many others I went to this book because of Amazon's comparisons to The  Ya-Ya Sisterhood but this book, and all the rest of hers, are in a  different league!  I loved the Ya-Yas but Michael Lee West has a much more  mature, careful and fully realized writing style.  Her characters are  ALIVE!	1999-04-19

Every time I see this book it brings back memories of my own childhood - mostly because I loved the book itself and not because I ran wild in the Plaza Hotel or anything quite that Eloise-esque.  Eloise is WONDERFUL!  She  reminds me, in bits and pieces, of little girls I've known over the years -  maybe even a little of myself.  I recommend this book to everyone.  It is  truly a gem.  I think someday soon I'm going to have to replace my old copy  of it that has been loved to near death - not to mention colored all over.  The illustrator also illustrated the pictures for the Miss Piggle Wiggle  series that I loved so much as a little girl.  Really captures the essence  of childhood - and bad little kids that you just love.	1998-12-16
US	52269248	RMJ21UTNA98TT	0689815050	19687724	Liza Lou And The Yeller Belly Swamp	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A &quot;feel good&quot; book for little girls (&amp; big ones) everywhere!	This is one of those books that makes you glad you're a girl!  However, that's not to say that boys can't get a kick out of it too.  Liza Lou is a strong and intelligent little girl.  She's a good role model for little  girls everywhere.  I'm always looking for books that will make my little  girls feel strong, and this is definitely high on the list.  The best thing  about it, is that it's just as enjoyable for adults as it is for kids.  The  imagination in the story telling is wonderful and humorous.  And Mercer  Mayer's illustrations are, as usual, outstanding!	1998-12-16

I am not a fan of Anne Rice's Vampire chronicles, so I was skeptical when someone suggested I read The Witching Hour.  However, this book and the ones that followed (Lasher and Taltos) changed my life!  They were so  wonderful, so amazing, so imaginative.  What an amazing grasp Ms. Rice had  on the entire ancestry of the Mayfair Witches!  It just blew me away.  I  wish more than anything that she would write more about them.  I miss them,  and I know eventually I will have to read all three books again - although  it has already been nearly three years since I began reading them and they  are all still as fresh on my mind as if I put the last one down yesterday.  I beseech you, Ms. Rice! Let go of the vampires and write more about the  witches!!!	1998-12-16

This is a wonderful book that teaches how valuable friendship is no matter who you are or what you look like.  The illustrations were stunning enough for me to pick this book up and buy it without even reading the story.  I  was then overjoyed once I got home and read it, to find what a true gem it  actually was.  I hope the duck and the alligator have more fun adventures  that I can read and share with my children in the future.	1998-12-15

This book was recommended to me by my best friend who is an early elementary school teacher.  She buys all the copies of this book whenever she finds it for presents for everyone she knows.  It is a wonderful story  for young kids and the illustrations are bound to delight young and old  alike.  The imaginative illustrations allow a good degree of interactivity  between the reader and the listener.  It is a really wonderful book and I'm  glad it's become one of the books in my collection.	1998-12-15

Not usually a fan of law concentrated novels, I was completely glued to my chair for the entire reading of this book.  Caroline Masters is a fascinating character.  Her life and her family are so intriguing that it  makes you want more. I wish there was an entire series built around this  character - although it is hard to imagine uncovering anything more about  her past than already was in this book.	1998-12-14

Although they're all flawed, and many of them are hard to love, the character in Michael Lee West's Crazy Ladies are so fully developed they could be living next door.  This book opens your eyes to the difference  between the way we see are selves and the way we are perceived by those  around us.  That is exactly what brings each of her characters to life.  The story is also riveting and fully realized.  Just an amazing piece of  modern fiction.  Truly a labor of love.	1998-12-14

This heartwarming, tear-jerker is for everyone who has ever been either a mother or a daughter - and even for those who haven't.  It's about the complex relationship between women - be they mothers, daughters, sisters or  friends.  It is truly inspiring and moving.  Definitely one of the best  books I've ever read.  It has turned this television watcher back into a  reader again.	1998-12-02

My seven year old niece introduced it to me last Christmas.  Not only was the story hillarious and rivoting, and the rhyming perfect, but the &quot;find a  snowman in every picture&quot; theme kept us enthralled long after the  story had been read.  The pictures were also quite beautiful, I might add -  a tribute to the heights of quality children's books have reached in the  past few years.  This year I bought this book for all of my other nieces  and nephews - as well as a copy for myself!	1998-12-02

This book is a wonderful character study to accompany Rebecca Wells' second novel &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;.  However, it reads a little like an study for the second novel and not really as a  fully realized novel on its own.  I recommend this book but only after  you've read &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;.  It seems  to work better that way.	1998-12-02
