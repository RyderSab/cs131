US	51067904	R34WTJWZIRZA70	0684801221	737092002	The Old Man and The Sea	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A fishing story worth reading.	Winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature, Hemingway is also renowned for books such as \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (1929) and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (1940).  But his classic 1952 Pulitzer Prize winning novella \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is one of his most accessible works.  It recounts the battle of an old Cuban fisherman against the sea, during a fishing expedition filled with triumph and tragedy.  After 84 fruitless days of fishing, Santiago finally hooks a huge 18 foot marlin which he battles for three days of personal suffering, only to lose his prize catch to sharks on his way to shore.<br /><br />Although the plot can be summed up in just one sentence, Hemingway excels in creating a rich atmosphere in describing the old man's battle against nature and against himself.  \\"Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?\\"  By primarily referring to the protagonist as \\"the old man\\" instead of using his personal name Santiago, Hemingway emphasizes the human struggle, and touches on important themes about triumph in tragedy and human courage in struggle (although perhaps Hemingway gives too much credence to human pride as a motivation).  In the beginning, the old man's sail is characterized as \\"the flag of permanent defeat.\\" But despite losing his catch, there is a note of triumph at the end: \\"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\\"  The young boy Manolin, the baseballer DiMaggio, and the lions of Santiago's youth all represent images of youth and strength that sustain the old man on his road of suffering toward this triumph.<br /><br />The writing style is terse, easy-to-read, yet the resulting picture is tremendously powerful and beautiful in its simplicity. While a child can read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", only adults will truly appreciate the symbolism of the sea in representing human trials, and Santiago's struggle in overcoming them.  Some see Christ-like symbolism in Santiago's bleeding hands, and in the final journey of the defeated but triumphant old man carrying his mast up the hill, representing a spiritual triumph of a new life and resurrected respect for the old man attained through physical suffering and defeat.  Certainly Santiago is explicitly identified with Christ when he makes \\"just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the woods.\\"  Others have interpreted the novella autobiographically after the failure of Hemingway's 1950 novel \\"Across the River and Into the Trees,\\" with the sharks representing Hemingway's critics.<br /><br />In short, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a relatively quick and easy read, yet leaves you with a sense of depth that most modern fiction lacks.  As a companion that can help increase appreciation for the book, check out the 1958 movie version starring Spencer Tracy, which sticks closely to the book and features lengthy quotations as part of the narrative. - GODLY GADFLYut triumphant old man carrying his mast up the hill, representing a spiritual triumph of a new life and resurrected respect for the old man attained through physical suffering and defeat.

Book 1 of the \\"Martyr's Song\\" series reminded me of John Grisham, book 2 of Francine Rivers, but book 3 reminded me of Robert Ludlum. With fast-paced action you'd expect from a Robert Ludlum thriller, it's a suspenseful page-turner about a terrorist threat to America because of a nuclear bomb and about a CIA operative Casius who acts outside orders.  The story begins with two lovers, Tanya Vandervan and Shannon Richterson on a plantation in Venezuela. They are separated and both of their parents killed when the plantation is brutally attacked by drug-runners wanting to claim the territory as their own.  Believing each other to be dead, Tanya tries to overcome her past by becoming Sherry Blake, a medical student, whereas Shannon falls under the influence of the dark powers behind the witch-doctor Sula and becomes Casius, a hired assassin for the CIA.  Eight years later, their paths cross again in Venezuela, this time with global history at stake due to the terrorist threat.<br /><br />The theology underlies the plot to a lesser degree than the other two novels in the series.  For the most part this is a typical Robert Ludlum style read, minus the moral garbage, but with a killer on the loose, taking down villains, and a count-down for a nuclear explosion.  But the theology is there, because Dekker wants us to see God's hand acting behind the events that ensue.  Several times, Dekker portrays the unfolding events as moves in a chessmatch where God Himself is playing against the forces of evil.  \\"God's playing his pieces in this chess match ... They've been moving and countermoving for decades up there on this one.\\" The chess match imagery returns throughout the novel.  \\"We know who the players are.  They are God and they are the forces of darkness.  The white side and the black side.\\"  Dekker wants us to realize that God is in control behind the decisions of mankind: \\"he moves the match.\\"<br /><br />Shannon has embraced the side of evil and wants nothing else than to take revenge.  But his actions could place the future of the United States in jeopardy.  Evil can only be stopped and Shannon changed by Tanya's love for him.  Here Dekker shows how all the events are worked together by God.  Shannon asks: \\"You can't expect me to believe you were drawn to the jungle to save mankind from some diabolical plot to detonate a nuclear weapon on US soil.  You don't find that just a bit fantastic?\\"  Dekker wants us to realize that \\"nothing is without a purpose\\", and that God is governing all things in \\"God's chess match,\\" and this is why Shannon and Tanya have been brought together in love.  Tanya's  love plays a role in God's large plan:  \\"And if I hadn't loved you, the bomb would have gone off.  If my parents hadn't come to the jungle, or if we hadn't fallen in love, or if Abdullah had chosen a different location, the bomb would have gone off.  It was all God's leading, his turning evil to good.\\"  It's divine chess: \\"The Creator is the ultimate chess master, isn't he?  Why he allows evil to wreak havoc, we can hardly understand.  But in the end, it always plays into his hands.\\"  Ultimately Dekker wants us to marvel at the chessmaster: \\"God is quite brilliant, don't you think?\\"<br /><br />To properly understand the role that love plays in this cosmic chess game, one needs to read Vol. 2 of the series, because there Dekker more fully works out his understanding of true love as requiring a willingness to die to the self and one's own desires, in a Christlike sacrifice.<br /><br />In the end, the theological underpinning isn't entirely successful:<br /><br />1. Dekker emphasizes again and again that Tanya was made to love Shannon, but only until the final climax does it become somewhat clear how her final act of loving really does make a difference.  This is the hinge on which the whole chess match depends, yet there was still some cloud over *why* and *how* Tanya's love for Shannon changed the outcome. I found the main premise a little too hard to swallow.  It's true that God uses our moves and decisions as part of his chess match, but usually these are ordinary thought-out decisions of daily life, not irrational and unexplained passions resulting from visions.  Moreover, the chain of reasoning is weak.  While Dekker states that \\"our parents - they died for this day\\", yet if the parents hadn't died, the terrorists wouldn't have controlled the plantation, Shannon would not have been filled with revenge, and the bomb scenario would not have arisen in the first place.<br /><br />2. Dekker suggests that God speaks directly to people today in visions, although it could be conceded that this is merely a literary device that serves the plot.<br /><br />3. There are a few aspects of the plot that are somewhat too implausible, such as Tanya's return to Venezuela at the insistence of her adoptive grandma, and the failure of the two main characters to recognize one another.  The identification of Shannon with Casius is easy to figure out, but I suspect Dekker isn't trying to hide this from us, because he has a much greater surprise regarding character identity in store for us at the conclusion.<br /><br />These weaknesses aside, on the whole this is a well-written and thought-provoking novel. Overall this novel has less theological weaknesses than the first two, but the theology is more in the background here with the plot taking center stage.  Fans of Robert Ludlum style suspense thrillers will love the fast-paced story-line.  And although it's not quite as deep as his other novels, and the story-line could have been tightened somewhat, the theology is in itself sound.  For a fast paced read with the thrills of Ludlum and the theological depth of Peretti, read of \\"The Thunder of Heaven\\" and be reminded that God is the chessmaster behind history, working all things for good.  -GODLY GADFLYard to swallow.

Kent Anthony has hit the big-time with his brainchild software that will revolutionize banking, and is about to receive a $20 million payout.  Along with his wife Gloria and son Spencer, his life is about to change drastically. And it does.  But not in the way that Kent expects.  To say anything more would give away too much of the plot, and ruin the story-line for those who haven't read the book.  That in itself says a great deal about the power of the story.  Alongside Kent and his family is a larger cast of characters, including his old love Lacy, his banking colleagues, and his religious mother in-law Helen and her pastor Bill.<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />1. Theology: The gripping and suspenseful plot unravels within an important theological framework.  Unlike his mother-in-law, Kent is not a Christian, and it is around this that the novel's action is chiefly concerned.  Those familiar with the story of Job will not have difficulty in figuring out the significance of the title about Heaven's Wager.  But contrary to what some readers think, this is not quite a modern day Job story, as Dekker himself makes clear: In Kent's case Satan's challenge was not that he could make a righteous man curse God, but \\"that he could keep an unrighteous man from responding to God's love.\\" (p363)  The story is essentially a \\"game\\", a \\"war\\", and the prize is \\"a man's soul\\" (p158).  Dekker wants the reader to end with self reflection: \\"The same challenge has been cast over your soul. ... We are all Jobs in one way or another.\\" (p369)  \\"Over every man there is cast a challenge.\\" (p364)<br /><br />2. Plot: This theology is the framework and basis for the novel, but it does not intrude on the plot, which concerns Kent's struggle with grief, greed and revenge.  Kent's story is a sparkling one, and Ted Dekker is an excellent story-teller.  The plot began as interesting, quickly moved to exciting, and in the last stages is a fast-moving pageturner that you won't be able to put down easily.<br /><br />3. Character: Not only does Dekker know how to spin a story, he also develops a sympathetic character.  He brings the reader into Kent's mind, allowing us to feel his raw emotions and identify closely with his struggles, joys and pains.  These changing emotions are portrayed with vivid colour and conviction.<br /><br />4. Theme: Kent's experience clearly shows that money and power does not satisfy, and that true peace can only be found with God.<br /><br />Although the bulk of the novel concerns Kent's story, the underlying spiritual battle never comes to the foreground until the final chapter.  However the theological premise behind the events that transpire is evident in the character of Helen, who is assigned the task of God's intermediary and even has visions.  She is effectively a \\"seer\\" to whom God speaks (p85-86) and for whom the curtain of heaven is occasionally drawn aside: \\"God was making her see things more clearly these days, just as he'd done with Elisha's servant.  Drawing her into this huge drama unfolding behind the eyes of mortals.  She played the intercessor - the one mortal allowed to glimpse both worlds so that she could pray.\\" (p105).  At times Helen's role becomes somewhat absurd, as God apparently commands her to walk eight hours a day and pray for Kent (p129), which she does in the ridiculous outfit of knee high socks and running shoes.  Dekker is careful not to suggest that the outcome is dependent on human prayer, referring to C.S. Lewis' explanation \\"for why God insists on us having to do things like pray when he already knows the outcome.  It is for the expeirence of the thing.  The interaction.\\" (p180).  Elsewhere Dekker writes: \\"God certainly did not need an old lady's walking to move his hand.  Then again, neither had ne needed old Joshua and his cohorts traipsing around Jericho to tumple the wall, now, did he?  And yet he had demanded that.  This was not so different.\\" (p145)  Further it might be conceded Dekker is not suggesting that direct revelations and visions are normative for today, and this concept can be accepted as a literary device, similar to the men with green eyes who appear to be supernatural beings.  Overall the theological framework is fairly sound, although the way Dekker works it out is not always entirely convincing.<br /><br />Some problematic areas and questions:<br /><br />1. One does have to wonder if Dekker's theology does result in a man-centered story.  He suggests that heaven is holding its breath, to see what Kent will decide. \\"The heavens have been lined with a million creatures, intent on that man's every move for months.\\" (p363)  In heaven, apparently, are \\"A million beings peering over the railing at the choices of one man.  You would find the real game.\\" (p229)  But the Bible emphasizes that the real choice is the one God makes before the foundation of the world (Eph 1:3-5), and that the choices of men are the work of His Spirit as an outworking of God's prior choice (John 15:16; Acts 13:48).  This appears to be the result of Dekker's Arminian theology.<br /><br />2. Conversion is presented as the result of God's direct self-revelation (p359-61).  While this is conceivably possible (as in the case of the apostle Paul), this is the exception, and the norm is that conversion and faith are worked by the Holy Spirit through the gospel and its preaching.  By presenting conversion as occurring in this extraordinary way, Dekker misses an opportunity to display the power of the gospel (Rom 1:16; 10:9-10).  God and his angels are not spectators to conversion as a pure decision on man's part, but God Himself is an agent of conversion and sovereignly works that decision by the Word and Spirit.<br /><br />3. There is the suggestion that experience is to be relied instead of doctrine (p83).  When it is suggested to Helen that \\"You can't just throw out all doctrine for some experience,\\" she replies: \\"And what if that experience is God, the creator?  What is more important to you, an encounter with God or your doctrine?\\" (p256)  This is, however, a false dilemma, because the true experience of God will never contradict his revelation in the Bible or the doctrines of Scripture.  The Bible tells us that experience is unreliable because Satan can appear disguised as an angel of light (2 Cor 11:14), that he deceives people by wonderous signs and experiences (Matt 24:24; Rev 13:14), and that we are to hold to the doctrines of Scripture even if an angel tells us otherwise (Gal 1:8).<br /><br />4. Dekker subscribes to the \\"God loves you\\" theology of Arminianism (p54.,96,110).<br /><br />5. The concept of God suffering (p53-4) is questionable.<br /><br />6. I find it hard to believe that even someone whose appearance has been altered by plastic surgery wouldn't be recognized through conversation by his voice and vocabulary.  But this is a minor quibble.<br /><br />On the whole it's a gripping story, and the theological questions the novel raised were not sufficient to prevent me from enjoying the story because the theological framework was more in the background, and the focus was on a fast-moving roller-coaster plot, much in the style of John Grisham's \\"The Partner\\", although with a more repentant protagonist.  Dekker makes mention of tragic events behind Helen's life in connection with a tragic episode during the war that involved the murdering of a priest (p251-3).

In a small village in Serbia, a Christian community is brutalized by a group of soldiers, the women threatened with death and forced to carry heavy stone crosses from the nearby cemetery.  \\"You're simply going to carry a cross for your Christ.\\" Under the orders of his brutal commander Karadzic, Janjic Jovic participates in the crazy game, which results in the death of a young girl and a priest, Father Micheal. Jan can't understand how these Christians accept \\"the death of martyrs, choosing death instead of renouncing Christ, and their outpouring of love for Christ leads Jan to swear to follow their Christ.<br /><br />Later in America, Jan writes a best-selling book which recounts his life-story, \\"The Dance of the Dead\\".  Engaged to marry his beautiful agent and publicist Karen, and on the verge of a multi-million dollar movie deal, everything is set for a happy ending.  Until Jan meets Helen, a promiscuous drug addict who begs him for help.  Helen is a familiar character from Book 1, but now we learn her true story: \\"My dad was an idiot and my mom was a vegetable and I became a junkie.\\"  When Jan finds himself falling in love with Helen, he must deal with the anger of the Christian community, as well as with Glenn Lutz, Helen's powerful lover and drug supplier.<br /><br />Helen \\"was addicted...from the soul up,\\" and even after her marriage to Jan she keeps returning to Glenn.  How will Jan respond?  The main message of \\"The Dance of the Dead\\" is that \\"God loves man passionately, that one moment with God is worth death\\". Although he's witnessed the love of a priest and a young girl for Christ, has Jan himself really learned what this love is?  Ivena, his \\"adoptive\\" mother from Serbia thinks not: You have not \\"learned the nature of God's love yet,\\" \\"God knows you have more to learn of love.\\"  In the events that follow, Jan's love for Helen mirrors God's love for sinners.<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />1. Plot: The story-line isn't quite as fast as the first book in the series, but the action is certainly as intense, particularly in the first and the last part of the book (although the climax is not entirely convincing).  The story of persecution in Serbia is horrifying, but gripping, intense, and stirring.<br /><br />2. Theology: Unlike many other Christian novelists, Dekker's theology is not incidental to the story-line, but underlies the entire plot, and is the framework that shapes and holds the story.  The peril of this approach is that flawed theology will ruin the entire book, but conversely accurate theology results in an even more powerful and solid story than most.  The theological thrust of the novel revolves around two main points:<br /><br />a) God's love for sinners.<br /><br />i. Jan comes to realize that his love for Helen has been worked in him by God, and reflects Christ's love for the church. Here Dekker clearly draws on the imagery from the book of Hosea and the Song of Songs, as Jan says: \\"You have made me Solomon, desperate for the maiden; you have made me Hosea, loving with your heart.\\"<br /><br />ii. Under the influence of her addictions, Helen is pulled back to her former life with Glenn, who even says to her: \\"To you I'm Satan.\\"  Helen's longing to go back to Glenn, \\"wallowing back to that pig,\\" is \\"no different than what most men do with Christ.\\"  Sin is an addiction and a form of slavery, and Christians are guilty of going back to it time and again, just like Helen.<br /><br />iii. Although Helen is adulterous, yet Jan continues to love her.  His \\"love for an adulterous woman\\" is \\"no different than God's love for an adulterous nation.  For Israel.  No different than his deep love for the church. His bride.  You.\\"<br /><br />b) The need for sinners to respond to God's love by dying to themselves.<br /><br />i. A repeated thematic note is that \\"Death must be embraced if you wish to follow Christ.\\" Sometimes this requires physical death as a martyr.<br /><br />ii. But more important than physical suffering is the need to put to death sinful desires.  This is what Helen, too, must learn.  \\"Even after being on the receiving end of Jan's love she still did not know how to return that love for the simple reason that she wasn't yet willing to die to her own longings.  Love is found in death ... It's only when you decide to give up yourself - to die - that you yourself will understand love.\\"<br /><br />Some problematic areas and questions:<br /><br />a) One of the most serious problems is \\"Book 2 - The Sinner\\", when Jan abandons his engagement to Karen and instead falls in love with and marries the junkie Helen.  Dekker wants us to see Jan's love for Helen as an image of God's love for sinners, but this image fails in several ways:<br /><br />i. Jan is being unfaithful to his promise of marriage to Karen, follows his feelings of passion and lust.  Karen is correct when she says: \\"Oh come on, Jan.  Don't cast this off on God.  You know how pathetic that sounds?  You dumped me for another woman because God told you to?\\"  I agreed.  Rather than sympathize with Jan, I sympathized with Karen and was quite angry with Jan at this point.<br /><br />ii. Although Helen appears to be a Christian later, when Jan first falls for her and proposes marriage to her, she is still an unbeliever.  Dekker presents Jan's love for Helen as worked by God, yet the Bible is very clear that a believer should not be unequally yoked with an unbeliever (2 Cor 6:14-17).<br /><br />iii. Helen wins Jan's love by her charm and beauty and is presented as a victim of her circumstances, a woman that we cannot help but feel sorry for.  Sinners aren't loveable victims but ugly rebels who reject God's commandments and don't deserve mercy!<br /><br />Rather than suggesting that Jan's actions mirror God's love, I would suggest that Jan's treatment of Karen mirrors our treatment of God by our unfaithfulness! Jan who is the sinner by being unfaithful to his promised engagement to Karen in following his feelings of lust for a junkie.  Jan's actions in Part 2 of the book (before this marriage) seriously weaken the theological framework, and the story only makes most sense *after* Jan's marriage.<br /><br />b) Dekker glorifies physical suffering for Christ, and confuses it with the need to crucify our old nature.  In the first part of the novel, the statement that \\"The greatest part of love is found in death\\" is applied to physical death and suffering.  Dekker is more correct towards the end of the novel when he shows that carrying our cross primarily requires putting to death our sinful desires, which is even more difficult.  \\"Is the death of the will any less painful than the death of the body ... in reality the death of the will is far more traumatic than the death of the body.\\"<br /><br />Is \\"While Heaven Weeps\\" worth reading?  Despite some serious theological flaws, it's still worth reading.  It's a gripping read, and Dekker is a good writer who knows how to keep us turning the pages.  This novel does have something very powerful to say about God's love for sinners, and about the need for sinners to die to their old nature. It's just too bad that Dekker missed an opportunity to state this message more clearly than he did.  But thumbs up to Dekker for trying to write a novel that is far deeper than most Christian writers today.  -GODLY GADFLYing is the need to put to death sinful desires.  This is what Helen, too, must learn.  \\"Even after being on the receiving end of Jan's love she still did not know how to return that love for the simple reason that she wasn't yet willing to die to her own longings.

Sinners aren't loveable victims but ugly rebels who reject God's commandments and don't deserve mercy!<br /><br />Rather than suggesting that Jan's actions mirror God's love, I would suggest that Jan's treatment of Karen mirrors our treatment of God by our unfaithfulness! Jan who is the sinner by being unfaithful to his promised engagement to Karen in following his feelings of lust for a junkie.  Jan's actions in Part 2 of the book (before this marriage) seriously weaken the theological framework, and the story only makes most sense *after* Jan's marriage.<br /><br />b) Dekker glorifies physical suffering for Christ, and confuses it with the need to crucify our old nature.  In the first part of the novel, the statement that \\"The greatest part of love is found in death\\" is applied to physical death and suffering.  Dekker is more correct towards the end of the novel when he shows that carrying our cross primarily requires putting to death our sinful desires, which is even more difficult.  \\"Is the death of the will any less painful than the death of the body ... in reality the death of the will is far more traumatic than the death of the body.\\"<br /><br />Is \\"While Heaven Weeps\\" worth reading?  Despite some serious theological flaws, it's still worth reading.  It's a gripping read, and Dekker is a good writer who knows how to keep us turning the pages.  This novel does have something very powerful to say about God's love for sinners, and about the need for sinners to die to their old nature. It's just too bad that Dekker missed an opportunity to state this message more clearly than he did.  But thumbs up to Dekker for trying to write a novel that is far deeper than most Christian writers today.  -GODLY GADFLY	2004-12-27

With his first book, \\"Directed Verdict\\", Randy Singer has climbed the heights with a quality suspense thriller not far behind some of Grisham's best.  Like Grisham, Singer is a Christian, but the Christian content is far more explicit than one typically finds in a Grisham novel.  Two American missionaries, Charles and Sarah Reed, suffer horrendous persecution at the hands of the religious police (the Muttawa) in Saudi Arabia.  When Sarah returns to the US after the torture and death of her husband, she comes into contact with Brad Carson, a young lawyer who helps her file a civil rights suit against the Muttawa head (Ahmed Aberijan) and against the nation of Saudi Arabia.  Helping Brad to fight for Sarah's cause are his long-term legal secretary Bella, his newly acquired helper Nikki, and a recently widowed law student, Leslie.  But do they realize that they are seeking justice against powers that will stop at absolutely nothing to win this case?<br /><br />The novel is divided into four sections.  Part I, \\"Persecution\\", very cleverly juxtaposes the persecution of the Reeds in Saudi Arabia with the persecution of Christians in America who speak out against abortion.  Part II \\"The Law\\" and Part III \\"Discovery\\" set the stage for Part IV, \\"The Trial\\", which makes up half the novel, and recounts the court case itself.  There are lots of surprising twists and turns, leading up to a fast moving and satisfying conclusion (though arguably optimistic). Will the head of the opposing legal team, Mack Strobel, be successful in seeking a directed verdict in favour of the defendants (an extraordinary verdict in which the judge makes a ruling on the grounds that no reasonable jury could decide otherwise)?  Which of Carson's own legal team is giving inside information to the other side?  And will justice prevail?<br /><br />Although the novel concerns the treatment of Christians, the Christian content itself is not overdone and does not dominate the novel or detract from the storyline as the case with some writers who become artificially \\"preachy\\".  There is much reminiscent of the style of Grisham's most overtly \\"Christian\\" work, \\"The Testament\\", which also features a Christian protagonist.  Singer's Arminian theology is evident in one place (p290-291) as part of a conversion story that seems somewhat artificial and forced, although it features some excellent application of courtroom imagery to salvation: \\"Sarah believed that her real accuser was Satan, that God was her Judge, and that Jesus Christ Himself was her Advocate. In the only courtroom that mattered, her Advocate had taken her place as the defendant and endured her punishment.  As a result, the Judge of the universe had declared her not guilty.\\" (p290).  But on the whole the Christian content is in the background, and the focus is on the story itself.  The suspenseful plot is combined with realistic characterization, because even the \\"good guys\\" have weaknesses, and the lawyers defending the cause of evil do have some moral standards.  My final verdict: \\"Directed Verdict\\" is a good courtroom drama that's hard to put down, so I'll definitely be wanting to read more from this author! - GODLY GADFLYerdone and does not dominate the novel or detract from the storyline as the case with some writers who become artificially \\"preachy\\".

Although he also wrote several novels featuring the world's greatest fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, it was especially in his short stories that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle perfected the Holmes formula.  \\"His Last Bow\\" (published in 1917) is the fourth of the five collections of Holmes short stories.  The other collections all featured a dozen stories, but only eight stories make up \\"His Last Bow\\".  The title is based on the final story of the same name, which portrays the retired Holmes active in bee-keeping, and emerging from retirement only to protect English secrets during the First World War.  Doyle was arguably past his prime in producing Sherlock Holmes stories, but this is still a very good collection of stories, and although there are only eight stories, unlike some of the other collections there is no obviously inferior story among them.  The Bruce-Partington Plans, The Dying Detective and The Devil's Foot are especially outstanding, but all the other stories in this collection are very good as well.  It may not match the brilliance and popularity of the first three collections (\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\", \\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\" and \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\"), but it's not far behind, and Holmes fans will find every one of the eight stories of \\"His Last Bow\\" most enjoyable.<br /><br />Here's a list of the stories in this collection (with the better stories marked with stars):<br /><br />Wisteria Lodge, 1908 - This two-part story recounts the strange experiences of Mr. John Scott Eccles, whose Spanish host Garcia and his two servants mysteriously vanish overnight.

His only hope for survival appears to be Mr. Culverton Smith, a specialist in such diseases, but unfortunately also a criminal who would be glad to see Holmes die.<br /><br />Lady Frances Carfax, 1911 - When Lady Frances Carfax goes missing, her life is unwittingly threatened by Holy Peters, an unscrupulous criminal from Australia who is now posing as someone else.<br /><br />*The Devil's Foot, 1910 - A thrilling and convincing story, as Mortimer Tregennis reports the bizarre death of his sister and sudden madness of his two brothers.

There are few better detectives in fiction than Sherlock Holmes.  And there is no Holmes novel better than \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\\"  Granted, Doyle may have been at his best when penning his short stories, but of his four novels starring Holmes, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is easily his best, and arguably among the best-ever novel-length murder mysteries.  Published in 1902, Holmes wrote \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" after he had published his first two collections of short stories, and when his pen was producing Sherlock Holmes at his best.<br /><br />The adventure starts when Sir Charles Baskerville, owner of the Baskerville mansion, meets an untimely death from a heart attack, apparently the result of his terror while faced with a huge hound.  An old Baskerville family legend testified to a supernatural and ghostly hound that tormented the family, and Charles' death appears to confirm local gossip that the hound is alive and roaming the moors.  When Sir Charles' only living relative and heir of his fortune, Sir Henry Baskerville, arrives at Baskerville Hall, his life too appears to be threatened.  Who is following him, who is stealing his boots, and who is the author of a warning note? To protect Sir Henry and unravel the mystery, Dr. James Mortimer, friend of the late Sir Charles, obtains the involvement of Holmes and his loyal sidekick Dr. Watson.  While he does not expressly discount supernatural involvement, Holmes uses the ruthless application of logic and reason to find the real solution to the mystery.<br /><br />The plot thickens as an escaped convict hiding on the moor joins the action.  Homes must uncover the masks behind a cast of mysterious characters, including the caretakers Mr. & Mrs Barrymore, the amateur astronomer Mr. Frankland and his daughter Laura Lyons, and the botanist Jack Stapleton and his sister Beryl.  With the appropriately chilling and melodromatic setting of the gloomy moor, the action increases with a thrilling finale, as Holmes uses Sir Henry himself as bait to bring the criminal out of hiding, and reveal the mystery behind the supernatural hound from hell.  And after the excitement of the climax dies down, we are given the pleasure of sitting down with the great detective, as he explains everything in his usual way with cold calculated logic.<br /><br />What makes \\"The Hound of the Baskerviles\\" work so well is the combination of all these elements. The eerie setting, superb characterization, and a well-paced narrative plot, are gift-wrapped with the logical deductions that are the hallmark of a typical Sherlock story.  But unlike some of the Holmes short stories, the novel length of \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" allows room for traditional murder mystery thrills and spine-tingling suspense before the illuminating deductions of Holmes that his fans expect and love.  For once, the logic and persona of the great detective is overshadowed by a suspenseful plot.  This is a murder-mystery classic, and if there is one Doyle novel that Sherlock Holmes fans should read, it's undoubtedly this one. -GODLY GADFLYas Holmes uses Sir Henry himself as bait to bring the criminal out of hiding, and reveal the mystery behind the supernatural hound from hell.

Orson Scott Card burst into fame with his multiple award winning novel \\"Ender's Game\\".  \\"Songmaster\\" is a novel from earlier in his writing career, and like \\"Ender's Game\\" features a young boy prodigy as the protagonist, a child who is being nurtured by adults for a key role in society. In \\"Songmaster\\", that child is Ansset, a young boy whose brilliant musical gifts are being developed at the \\"Songhouse\\".  More so than any of his contemporaries, Ansset is able to create music that reflects the feelings of his audience, and expresses the full range of human emotions through song.  People who enjoy the emotive power of music - as I do - will find this a compelling and fascinating premise. Under the expert guidance of his songmaster Esste, Ansset is groomed for the highest role possible: to be a Songbird who moves and influences great audiences with his music.  Ansset proves to be a Songbird so rare, he becomes Songbird for the emperor Mikal himself.  Card describes Ansset's progress to the very heights of political power, to his final return to the Songhouse as an anonymous old man. Some have even interpreted the novel as a retelling of David's rise from singer to king in place of Saul, although personally I found little evidence for such a parallel.<br /><br />The characterization is very good, and the concept of the Songhouse and using music to reflect and convey emotion is an interesting and powerful one.  But the novel doesn't consistently live up to its promise.  Although it has superlative moments of beauty and passion, \\"Songmaster\\" is in the end inferior to the brilliant Ender's Game series that Card would later produce.  Most unexpected (and perhaps disturbing to some readers), is the prominent place Card gives to homosexuality in the novel.  Several homosexual relations are explored, and this is especially surprising given Card's Mormon background.  Depending on your personal convictions, many readers like myself will find this an element that detracts significantly from whatever excellence the rest of the novel offers.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Songmaster\\" has its place in the Orson Scott Card canon, but this early effort is a more lowly effort, and I'm not planning on keeping my copy of this book having read it.  Science fiction fans will be grateful that Card's writing career didn't end with \\"Songmaster\\", but progressed from these early beginnings to the excellence of \\"Ender's Game\\". - GODLY GADFLYicantly from whatever excellence the rest of the novel offers.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Songmaster\\" has its place in the Orson Scott Card canon, but this early effort is a more lowly effort, and I'm not planning on keeping my copy of this book having read it.

Along with the second collection (\\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\"), \\"Return\\" is generally regarded as inferior to the superlative first collection (\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but easily better than the last two in the series (\\"His Last Bow\\" and \\"The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes\\").  After Doyle had apparently killed Holmes in the last story of \\"Memoirs\\" (The Final Problem), the popular outcry which followed the disappearance of the legendary detective eventually led Doyle to resurrect his character in the first story of this new collection (The Empty House).  But with \\"Return\\", Doyle perhaps even surpassed the earlier effort of \\"Memoirs\\", with excellent stories such as The Empty House, The Dancing Men, The Prioriy School, and the Six Napoleons, and other favorites like The Norwood Builder, Charles Augustus Milverton, The Golden Pince-Nez, and The Second Stain.  In my view, fans of \\"Adventures\\" will find that the dozen stories of \\"Return\\" are a great second choice, and not much far behind the brilliance of the first collection.<br /><br />Here's a list of the stories in this collection (with the better stories marked with stars):<br /><br />**The Empty House, 1903 - One of the top ten stories, the presumed dead Holmes is \\"resurrected\\" to solve the murder of Ronald Adair, a card player.

Ted Dekker is regarded by many as one of the hottest writers of Christian fiction, and his novel \\"Blink\\" goes a long way to explain why.  It's a thrilling and suspenseful story of the brilliant American student Seth Borders and the runaway Saudi Arabian princess Miriam.  Miriam is the object of an arranged marriage to a vile man.  Her marriage plays a key role in Middle East political intrigues and is integral to a planned coup with huge political implications.  When Miriam flees her marriage and her repressive Islamic context to America, she connects with Seth.  Seth has an IQ above 190, and discovers that he has a remarkable ability to see possible futures.  But his ability is mostly limited to seeing ahead a few hours, and at times it disappears altogether.  And which of the possible futures that he sees should he choose?  Together Seth and Miriam join the readers on a thrilling ride as they dodge their pursuers and seek freedom.<br /><br />The premise about Seth's ability to see the future is a good one, and for the most part it works.  Dekker stretches it a little too far by suggesting that it is similar to the conditional prophecies uttered by Old Testament prophets.  What characterized Biblical prophecy was not so much an ability to see possible futures, but rather the ability to directly proclaim God's Word (which on many occasions did concern the future).  While Seth's ability is remarkable, it is not accurate to equate it with Biblical prophecy.  But this is a minor quibble, and doesn't detract from the idea itself.  Dekker's focus is that the future is in God's control, and in this regard he is completely correct, and his novel thoroughly thought provoking.  When impossible situations arise, God can change the future in a way that even Seth himself can't imagine.  This is especially evident in the conclusion: where the hand of God brings Seth and Miriam out of an impossible situation, yet in a very satisfying and convincing way.<br /><br />In short, \\"Blink\\" offers an excellent and exciting story-line with political intrigue and suspenseful action, interwoven with thought-provoking theological and philosophical threads about prayer and providence.  Aside from being hampered at times by the complexity of Middle East politics, this is a great and exciting novel, and I'm definitely going to add more Dekker books to my wish list! - GODLY GADFLYk\\" offers an excellent and exciting story-line with political intrigue and suspenseful action, interwoven with thought-provoking theological and philosophical threads about prayer and providence.

In one of his few failures, Holmes connects the events to the Ku Klux Klan, but not soon enough to prevent another death.<br /><br />*The Man with the Twisted Lip, 1891 - A baffling mystery about Mr. Neville St. Clair who disappears from a room into thin air, and a professional beggar who is the suspected murderer.<br /><br />***The Blue Carbuncle, 1892 - Another favorite all-time top 5 Holmes story, as Holmes unravels how a blue diamond ended up inside the goose intended for Mr. Henry Baker's Christmas dinner.<br /><br />***The Speckled Band, 1892 - Universally regarded as the most popular short story in the Sherlock Holmes canon, and easily one of the more suspenseful and chilling.

These two volumes contain the complete collection of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's adventures of the world's most famous super sleuth, Sherlock Holmes.  For any mystery reader, the Sherlock Holmes stories are must-have classics, with a combination of excellent characterization and ruthless logic coming together in the enigmatic person of Holmes himself.  Watson's analysis of Holmes is insightful: \\"Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero...Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.\\"  What marks Holmes is his ability to perceive the extraordinary in the ordinary.  To quote the man himself:  \\"Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent ... there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace ...  The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home ... There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.\\"  Like Watson, we readers are frequently amazed at the logical deductions he produces, as Watson humbly confesses to Holmes, \\"When I hear you give your reasons, the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process.\\" Watson is often perplexed as we are: \\"I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.  Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.\\"  But perhaps what we enjoy most is the moment when Holmes sits in his chair to unravel the mystery for us.<br /><br />Altogether Doyle wrote four novel-length books featuring Holmes: \\"A Study in Scarlet\\"; \\"The Sign of Four\\"; \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\"; and \\"The Valley of Fear\\".  But the greatest ever fictional detective especially acquired his legendary status through the 56 short stories starring Holmes, in which Doyle perfected the Holmes formula.  Each story is written from the perspective of Holmes' side-kick, Dr. Watson, and can be read independently.  It's in these short stories that Doyle excels.<br /><br />Originally written as five separate collections of about a dozen stories each, the best and most popular collection is the first, \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1892), which contains top classics like \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", \\"The Red-headed League\\", \\"The Five Orange Pips\\", \\"The Blue Carbuncle\\", and the story universally regarded as the most popular short story in the entire Sherlock Holmes canon, \\"The Speckled Band\\".  Although not quite as popular, the second and third collections are still very good.  \\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1893) has excellent stories like \\"Silver Blaze\\", \\"The Stock-broker's Clerk\\", and \\"The Musgrave Ritual\\".  \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1905) is arguably even better, including favorites like \\"The Empty House\\", \\"The Dancing Men\\", \\"The Prioriy School\\", and \\"The Six Napoleons\\". The last two collections, \\"His Last Bow\\" (1917) and \\"The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1927), did not quite live up to the same standards as their predecessors, but are still worth reading.<br /><br />The good news is that in these two volumes published by Bantam Classics you get the works - all the stories Doyle ever wrote about Holmes.  As a reader who enjoys a good mystery story, this remains one of my favourites, and with over 1500 pages of reading, is a worthy addition to any personal library!  Although written in the early 20th century, Holmes' incredible deductions and brilliant detective work is timeless, and will continue to amaze and entertain readers well into the 21st century.<br /><br />- GODLY GADFLYe 21st century.<br /><br />- GODLY GADFLY	2004-08-16

But unlike his later fantasies, \\"Dream Thief\\" is a science fiction story.  While researching dreams on the space station Gotham, the protagonist Spencer Reston discovers that someone is trying to control his mind through his dreams.  A fairly exciting plot develops, as the villain Ortu (an alien) and the sinister side-kick Hocking (in his pneumatic wheelchair) begin carrying out their plans for control of the world.  Along with his lovely lady friend Ari, and his two fellow scientists Adjani and Gita, it is up to Spence to prevent their evil plans from succeeding.  The main threat comes from a \\"tanti\\", a consciousness-altering device capable of broadcasting to the whole world and inducing dreams and manipulating minds.  In the process of resisting the \\"Dream Thief\\" who is masterminding the plot, Spencer travels to Mars where he discovers remnants of Martian civilization and meets the Martian guardian Kyr.  Amidst the action and excitement, Lawhead integrates an interesting premise by suggesting that the revered gods of Indian folklore and Hindu legends were in fact such Martians (p451-2).<br /><br />In many respects this is stereotypical science fiction, with lots of rocket ships, alien spacecraft, Martians and an extended visit to Mars.  The plot is not always as convincing and suspenseful as readers of later Lawhead might expect.  But there are certainly flashes of Lawhead's later brilliance, emotion and creativity.  Typical for Lawhead, there are also Christian overtones throughout, such the presence and involvement of a Divine Being, and a sacramental meal called the Essila much like the Lord's Supper (p408-414).  Judging by the high standards of his later work, \\"Dream Thief\\" is an inferior work.  But for readers looking for an interesting and thought-provoking science fiction story with lots of adventure and some subtle theology, this is still a good read.

David & Karen Mains' Kingdom Tales consist of three volumes: Tales of the Kingdom, Tales of the Resistance, and Tales of the Restoration.  First published in hardcover in 1983, 1986 & 1996 with delightful illustrations by Jack Stockman, these three books have been reissued in softcover in 2000, but now with a limited number of black-and-white illustrations by Linda Wells which don't do much to enhance the text.  Each volume consists of twelve fantasy short stories, set in a city ruled by an evil Enchanter who has usurped the throne from the true King.  The stories are all separate events often involving different characters, but are bound together as part of a larger story as the Enchanted City is rescued by the exiled King and becomes the Bright City, leading to a joyous conclusion as the people of Great Park and Bright City begin the Great Celebration at the conclusion of the Restoration.  The main returning character is Scarboy, an orphan boy who escapes from the Enchanted City with his brother, Little Child, and becomes Hero in the service of the King.<br />Although the stories have distinctive allegorical qualities, they are more like religious fables or fairy tales, drawing on the imagery of the kingdom that Jesus Christ Himself taught in His ministry.  Under the influence of the evil Enchanter, the people of the Enchanted City prefer darkness to the light, and so sleep during the day and work at night.  But the King is at work delivering the city and rescuing the poor and needy and bringing them to the Great Park.  Even though the Enchanter's men proclaim \\"There is no such thing as a King\\", the King's men know \\"that \\"Things are not what they seem.\\" They realize that even though the Enchanter had said \\"Seeing is believing\\", reality is different: \\"You have to believe in order to see.\\"  Christians will understand that these are important spiritual truths about faith and serving the King Jesus Christ.<br />Each volume has some stories that were especially memorable.  Volume 1 describes how Sarboy escapes the Enchanted City, where orphaned and handicapped children are enslaved.  In the Great Park he discovers the wonderful truth about God's kingdom.  One of my favorites in this volume was \\"The Baker who Loved Bread\\", which describes the King's Baker who bakes the King's Bread, but withholds this bread from poor and needy people, thinking he is doing a service to the king by doing so.  When he beats a person whom he believes to be a thief about to steal his bread, he discovers that he has actually harmed the King himself, and learns an important lesson: \\"Love for the King is measured by one's love for his people.  So the Baker fed the hungry and fed them well - lest the One he loved the most should starve.\\"  This concept is very clearly based on Christ's teaching in Matthew 25.<br />How successful these stories are on their own apart from the underlying spiritual truths is hard to tell.  The moral of the stories is generally quite transparent, although in the case of a few tales it is rather obscure.  But on the whole the message about serving and honouring the King Jesus Christ comes through loud and clear.  I found the stories thoroughly enjoyable particularly because of this deeper meaning.  I suspect that those who don't appreciate the deeper meaning will find it hard to enjoy the tales as stand-alone stories for their own sake. The concept is similar to the Narnia Chronicles, although not with the same degree of success, because the Narnian stories can also function on the level of stories alone.  But although the world isn't as fantastic as C.S. Lewis' Narnia, Narnian fans may find themselves appreciating the Kingdom Tales of the Mains for the same reasons: the spiritual depth.

Lawhead's \\"Celtic Crusades\\" continue with the next generation, Duncan, son of Murdo (familiar to readers of Vol. 1 in the series, \\"The Iron Lance\\").  One again the action revolves around a sacred relic, this time the black rood, a remnant of Christ's true cross, which Duncan aspires to obtain in a crusade to the Holy Land. The narrative of Duncan's vision of Christ's death in connection with this relic is one of the central passages of the book (p334-347).  In his quest, Duncan is accompanied by the Cele De priest Padraig and Prince Roupen of Armenia, and must deal with danger at the hands of the Moslems (Seljuq Turks) and the more mysterious intrigues of the Templar Knights.  As in the first novel of the series, the story is framed by the memoirs of Gordon Murray, a member of a nineteenth century secret society, but Murray's connection to the plot is still enshrouded in mystery and will only become clear in the final volume of the series.<br />There's no question that the novel is rich in historical detail and adventure, and there are some solid Christian themes.  Typical are sentences like: \\"the Swift Sure Hand does bend all things to the good of those who love him.\\"  Despite this, \\"The Black Rood\\" lacks the gripping suspense of Lawhead's historical epic \\"Byzantium\\", and the passion and imagination of his forays into fantasy.  I look forward to when Lawhead leaves the realm of historical fiction and returns to fantasy. -GODLY GADFLY	2004-05-20

In this edge-of-your-seat suspense thriller, Sigmund Brouwer shows the success of his earlier thriller novel \\"Double Helix\\" was not a fluke.  On this occasion, however, he leaves the field of medicine and science, and creates a heart-stopping plot revolving around a serial killer introduced as \\"The Watcher\\".  The novel is divided in two parts, the first of which is set in 1973.  Kelsie McNeill is the daughter of a local rancher, and is being stalked by a secret admirer, a serial killer who leaves her threatening notes of warning along with eagle feathers.  The second half of the novel is set in 1996, as Kelsie is married to Clay Garner, the FBI agent who was part of the intial investigation.  \\"The Watcher\\" sets his final plans in motion by kidnapping Kelsie and her son.  Clay's own life is in danger as he seeks to rescue his wife and son, as well as uncover the identity of the mysterious serial killer.<br />The plot is thoroughly suspenseful, with lots of twists and turns, and when the identity of the mysterious \\"Watcher\\" is revealed in the last pages, the reader is sure to be in for a surprise!  There are more Christian themes than in Brouwer's previous novel (the influence of C.S. Lewis is particularly apparent), but they are never a distraction from the main plot, and they are neither superficial nor overbearing as is the case in a lot of Christian fiction today.  Some may regret that the religious themes aren't more deeply explored, but this could result in excessiveness or in theological candy floss.  Brouwer wisely avoids both extremes by focussing on a suspenseful plot.  I would rate \\"Blood Ties\\" as being at least as good as the thrillers produced by Terri Blackstock and Dee Henderson, and a welcome alternative to secular suspense fiction authors like Mary Higgins Clark. -GODLY GADFLY	2004-05-20

With \\"The Mystic Rose\\", Stephen Lawhead's Celtic Crusades trilogy ends as it began: good but not great.  But perhaps that's because I have been spoiled by his superb ability in some of his other books.  This is still a decent historical adventure.  On this occasion the protagonist is Cait, daughter of Duncan and granddaughter of Murdo.  After the murder of her father Duncan, Cait uncovers a secret letter with details about the mystic rose, the famed Holy Grail from Christ's Last Supper.  After stealing the letter and armed with a small band of knights, Cait undertakes her own quest to grab the cup for herself.  But the ruthless Templar knight Renaud de Bracineaux is close on her heels, and has his own plans for the sacred relic.  The holy treasure becomes the object of a race between the two, both with ambitions of selfish greed.  The closing stages of the novel feature an unexpected and yet not unsatisfying resolution. The loose ends are finally tied together, including the long awaited connection with the story of Gordon Murray which frames the novel.<br />Having a heroic feminine protagonist with such determination seemed anachronistic, and it is debatable whether Lawhead was really able to create a female heroine with any degree of real success or conviction.  Yet what I appreciated about Lawhead's characterization is that Cait is a well-rounded character who develops, and that she needs to learn to overcome her lust for revenge, as well as her uncritical passion for a Moorish prince dubious in character. The repentant Cait is eventually overwhelmed by the enormity of her crimes, and confesses: \\"I prayed to be God's instrument of justice.  I thought to use the Mystic Rose to lure my father's killer to his doom.  For that, I needed the Holy Chalice, and I came here to take it.  You must think me a most brazen and contemptible sinner. The audacity of my deeds amazes even me.\\" (p414).  Lawhead's main character in this respect is a flawed and very real - just like ourselves - which makes his story all the more convincing and credible.  The Holy Grail plays an important role in Cait's change.  As was the case in the other books of the trilogy, coming into contact with the sacred relic leads to visions and experiences of spiritual renewal, sipping from the cup resulting on this occasion in a vision of the Passover Feast.<br />But while the characterization is quite sound, the plot lacks the suspense and imagination of some of Lawhead's other efforts, and the series as a whole lacks their intense passion and emotion.  Like the rest of the series, \\"The Mystic Rose\\" is good, but not great.  Here's hoping that Lawhead will return to crafting the novels in the genre that gained him such great success: the brilliant, imaginative and passionate historical fantasy of \\"The Song of Albion\\" trilogy and \\"Pendragon\\" cycle.  If not for the brilliance of these other works, perhaps I would be speaking in much more glowing terms of \\"The Celtic Crusades\\". But while this series doesn't shine so bright when compared with Lawhead's own work, perhaps it can hold its own against a great deal of other historical fiction today.

Published in 1968, 1971 and 1972, Ursula Le Guin's \\"Earthsea Trilogy\\" is widely regarded as a fantasy classic on a level not far from epics like Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and C.S. Lewis' \\"Narnia Chronicles\\".  The story begins with a young man named Ged, commonly called Sparrowhawk, who receives training to become a wizard.  His training in wizardry at the wizard school on the island of Roke begins with the power of illusion.  Most magic merely involves the apparent change from one thing to another.  But Ged is a brilliant student, and soon progresses to the true magic of changing.  \\"Magic consists in this, the true naming of a thing\\" - when one knows the true name of an object, one can begin changing things.  \\"Illusion fools the beholder's senses; it makes him see and hear and feel that the thing is changed.  But it does not change the thing.  To change this rock into a jewel, you must change its true name.  And to do that, my son, even to so small a scrap of the world is to change the world.\\"  This also applies in the world of men: \\"Who knows a man's name, holds that man's life in his keeping.\\"  But true magic is perilous: it affects the broader world, and can upset the balance of the world \\"Rain on Roke may be drouth in Osskil.\\"  Tempted by pride, hate and revenge over against Jasper, another student wizard, Ged tries calling forth a spirit of the dead and succeeds only in bringing a shadow of evil into the world.  LeGuin does not justify Ged's actions, but clearly portays his actions as the result of pride and hate, and resulting in ruin.  Like ourselves, Ged is a hero with flaws and must now live with their consequences.  In a manner not unlike a dark horror novel, this evil shadow now hunts Ged, and his quest is to hunt it in order to remove it from his world.<br />It's a gripping story, almost too dark at times, at least for young children.  But unlike some other popular fantasy novels, the magic here bears a close connection to the occult.  In Le Guin's world, a wizard is a respected adviser who plays a role similar to a religious leader in our world today.  His spiritual role includes aspects that are being popularized under the name of Wicca and similar pagan religions.  It's obvious that Le Guin's magic is pure fantasy, but the way it is worked out seems to closely resemble contemporary paganism, and this made me somewhat uncomfortable and question the suitability of this series for young children.  Unlike the Harry Potter series, this fantasy is much more serious (like Robert Jordan's World of Time there are also influences of Taoism) and never trite.  Like the Taoist yin-yang, Ged is driven by both evil and good desires; even the concept of the shadow has overtones of Jungian philosophy - modern readers have seen the book as model of Jungian psychology.  But this aside, there's no question about how gripping Le Guin's plot is, and how vivid her world.  It's no wonder this book won the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award in 1969, and Le Guin has proven herself by winning several Hugo and Nebula awards with other titles.

In the third entry to the Earthsea series, Ged is now Arch-Mage, and is faced with a new crisis: Magic around the world is failing.  Together with Arren, a young prince from Enlad, he journeys to the end of the world to battle and defeat the source of this threat to the world.  His quest is to rescue Earthsea from the death of magic.  It's an exciting adventure, perhaps even more so than the second volume of the series.  It was the National Book Award winner for Children's Books in 1973.<br />But of particular interst is the fact that through the eyes of Arren, the reader gains a true appreciation for the enduring qualities of a LeGuine type fantasy.  Arren is perplexed why Ged doesn't perform more magic, to the point where he even questions whether he is a true wizard.  \\"Even in small matters magery was not worth counting on.  Sparrowhawk was always miserly about employing his arts; they went by the world's wind whenever they might, they fished for food, and they spared their water, like any sailors ... There, thought Arren, lay the very heart of wizardry: to hint at mighty meanings while saying nothing at all, and to make doing nothing at all seem the very crown of wisdom.\\"  Over time Arren - and the reader - come to understand what magic in this world is really all about.  Eventually Arren learns that true wizards don't do magic all the time: \\"The first lesson on Roke, and the last is: Do what is needful.  And no more!\\"<br />This is the essence of magic in LeGuin's novels - one will not find here the trite magic used to make boys fly on brooms or make girls invisible, as one finds in books like Harry Potter.  LeGuin's magic and fantasy is never trite, but always serious and credible.  In many respects it represents an early form of new age philosophy.  \\"On every act the balance of the whole depends.  The winds and seas, the powers of water and earth and light, all that these do, and all that the beasts and green things do, is well done, and rightly done. All these act within the Equilibrium - But we, insofar as we have power over the world and over one another, we must *learn* to do what the leaf and the whale and the wind do of their own nature.  We must learn to keep the balance.\\"  Much of it appears to have roots in Eastern philosophy such as the Taoist yin-yang.  \\"There are two, Arren, two that make one: the world and the shadow, the light and the dark.  The two poles of the Balance. Life rises out of death, death rises out of life; in being opposite they yearn to each other, they give birth to each other and are forever reborn.\\"  The climax of the plot is taken straight from Jungian psychology: wholeness is obtained by embracing the darkest shadow of death.  Weighty dialogue about such philosophy fills the novel - this is not for the light-hearted.<br />Even if one disagrees with this philosophy, there has to be appreciation for LeGuin's seriousness and depth.  Ged and Arren's quest never has overtones of a fantasy fun adventure as one might find with J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, but it has a constant shadow of deep seriousness, perhaps even more so than J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles.  This deeper and more serious spin on fantasy in itself makes this series worth reading.  The fantasy world and storyline are not as captivating or fun as one might expect from Tolkien, Lewis, or even Rowling and Robert Jordan, and so fans of these novels might well find the taste of LeGuin somewhat disappointing.  Reviews of the fourth book of the series, Tenahu, suggest that this is a strongly feminist tale and a departure from the beauty of the first three novels, and is better left untouched.  I think I'll close the pages on LeGuin for now, with The Farthest Shore being the most distant shore of her work for me. -GODLY GADFLYe act within the Equilibrium - But we, insofar as we have power over the world and over one another, we must *learn* to do what the leaf and the whale and the wind do of their own nature.

In his latest legal thriller, John Grisham tackles the world of mass tort litigation, where lawyers sign up thousands of clients in class action lawsuits.  They tap into goldmines by forcing companies guilty of selling bad products to settle out of court, typically raking in millions of bucks in fees themselves because of the sheer numbers.  The protagonist is Clay Carter, a nobody at the Office of the Public Defender, who stumbles into a huge settlement that begins a meteoric rise for him to become the king of torts, earning millions. Who is the mysterious contact who is feeding Clay inside information to accomplish all this?  Clay's  increased richness is combined with an increased nastiness, and it takes some surprises to bring him to repentance \\"He was ashamed of his greed and embarrassed by his stupidity. It was sickening what the money had done to him.\\"<br />The story-line is quite gripping, probably because we identify with the hero, and his rise to success appeals to our own inate desire for instant wealth.  The protagonist has both virtues and vices, and we must both love and hate him at the same time (although the supporting cast of characters is rather cardboard and lame). There is a moral lesson in Clay's changing characterization, as he falls to the very depths of character and greed that he himself first despised.  Clay's rise and his fall is didactic, because ultimately Grisham wants us to be somewhat sickened by all the greed of money hungry mass tort lawyers. But while the filthy rich lawyers with their glitzy personal jets and bought women soon lose their appeal because of their nastiness, has the money itself lost its appeal for readers?  It could be argued that by the last page, our love of money which made the plot so gripping is still rather intact.  And some of the other smut we've encountered in the process isn't quite wiped clean either. At times Grisham is surprisingly and plainly smutty - the unmarried hero is sexually active, and although Grisham doesn't give us all the details of what happens in bed, he doesn't suggest it is wrong either. There are even a couple of sly references to homosexuality and bisexuality that were unnecessary.  While the morality tale about greed is crystal clear, it's a shame that Grisham appears to let some other morals slip in the process, or at least fails to make clear the lines between good and evil behaviour in other respects.<br />At the end of the day, like the main character, this morality tale is itself flawed and incomplete.  The plot isn't entirely credible either, especially the way in which Clay became chosen as the lawyer elect in the first settlement.  But if you can look past these weaknesses, this is another Grisham novel that can be enjoyed for what it is - a suspenseful legal pageturner.  This is not Grisham at his best (The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Rainmaker), but it isn't Grisham at his worst (The Summons) either.  Let's hope that Grisham has finished his own personal fall, and is on the rise again.Grisham doesn't give us all the details of what happens in bed, he doesn't suggest it is wrong either.

Germany desperately needs shipments of industrial diamonds to perfect its rockets.  The USA desperately needs functional high-altitude gyroscopes to perfect aircraft guidance systems.  Both sides have what the other needs.  And so unfolds \\"an exchange between enemies at the height of the bitterest war in the history of mankind\\" (p97), with Erich Rhinemann functioning as the liaison in the neutral territory of Buenos Aires to oversee the exchange.  David Spaulding, the man from Lisbon, is the American agent released from his service in Portugal and commissioned on a secret mission to bring the gyroscope blueprints back to the USA.  But he doesn't know the terrible secret of the diamond transfer which his country is giving up in exchange.  And who is trying desperately to stop the exchange?  And what role in the action does the fanatical Jewish group Haganah play?  What unfolds is combination of action and suspense, in typical Ludlum style.  But in the end the novel didn't quite live up to the potential that the premise offered, and the story lacked the heart-stopping action and suspense of Ludlum's better page-turners, and was burdened with too much confusing political dialogue, and unexplained loose ends.  An interesting read, but newcomers to Ludlum would be advised to begin instead with some of his better books, such as (in my preferred order) The Bourne Identity, The Materese Circle, The Holcroft Covenant, and The Aquitaine Progression. -GODLY GADFLY	2003-08-05

Lots of contemporary writers can regard themselves as successful writers of fiction.  Few can regard themselves as writers of truly *intelligent* fiction.  Orson Scott Card is certainly in this elite category, and his novel \\"Pastwatch\\" serves to show why.<br />On the surface, the novel consists of two separate story-lines, one set in the past, the other in the future.  The story-line of the past recounts the life of Christopher Columbus, describing his passion for success, and then secondly how he translates this passion into an unwavering desire to sail west after seeing a vision from God.  The story-line of the future recounts the activities of \\"Pastwatch\\", an operation in a post-modern world that has developed technology such as the TempoView and TruSite machines which enables them to view events of the past.  Key members of Pastwatch are Hassan, Tagiri, and their daughter Diko.  These two story-lines merge when the participants of the Pastwatch project discover that they can have the potential to change the past, and so also change the present and the future.  \\"We can reach back and make it better.\\"<br />It's at this point that the novel progresses from a work of fiction to a work of intelligent fiction.  The world in which the Pastwatch researchers live is on the verge of destruction and ruin with the collapse of civilization inevitable, and their discovery places them with a very significant moral and philosophical decision that mankind must make: Do they have a moral responsibility to change their past, and so delete their own existence and history, in the hope of creating a better alternate history?  Will a plan to stop Columbus from returning to Spain after his discovery of America successfully achieve such a noble goal?  In the process of discussing these issues, Card raises many profound questions about the state of mankind, and philosophical questions about how the redemption of mankind can be achieved.  The need for redemption lies in the corrupt state of the world: \\"The world would not have needed resurrecting if it had never been killed.\\"  Columbus seems to be a key turning point in history in the relationship between the cultures of America and Europe, and stopping him \\"might be worth undoing this age of healing on the firm chance of making it unnecessary\\" - rather than cure the patient, it would cure the disease! But will the plan work, or will the alternate history be worse?  \\"We don't want to stop Columbus if by doing so we'd make the world worse\\" This of course raises its own fascinating questions for anthropology and history: what were the effects of Columbus voyage and the subsequent colonization on the shape of the world?  There's a twist when the Pastwatch team uncovers the startling possibility that their own history may itself be an alternate history...<br />As a result, although ostensibly about Columbus, the novel actually works with the deeper themes of a fallen world and its redemption.  Columbus must be redeemed and saved from setting the human race on a fatal road, and it is the Pastwatch researchers who must play god and redeem mankind by returning to the past \\"If we're going to be gods, then I think we have a duty to come up with a better solution than the people who pray to us.\\" With this scheme, man can be his own saviour, because as a result of man's intervention \\"There will be a new earth\\"  Card sees the answer to the world's problem being a form of Christianity.  Not only must Columbus be redeemed, but so must the whole world.  Card's answer to this is: make them true Christians.  It is when the characters act in a truly Christian manner, that the evils of slavery and abuse can be prevented - and so the final world is actually a form of Christian utopia.<br />After these intensely interesting philosophical and moral questions have been discussed at length (probably the highlight of the novel), Card has three characters go back in time to do the deed: Hanahpu, Diko, and Kemal.  Even thoughthe time travel concept is fascinating, this part of the novel is somewhat less successful, as the interaction between various cultures in alternate histories becomes rather confusing.  Some familiarity with Columbus and the history of early America would go a long way to alleviating this difficulty, and this could be more of a failing on my part as a reader than a weakness of Card.<br />But these are minor quibbles - it's really the philosophy and psychology that's at the foreground, and the time travel is really just a literary device to deal with more important questions about history and humanity.

Some familiarity with Columbus and the history of early America would go a long way to alleviating this difficulty, and this could be more of a failing on my part as a reader than a weakness of Card.<br />But these are minor quibbles - it's really the philosophy and psychology that's at the foreground, and the time travel is really just a literary device to deal with more important questions about history and humanity.

In the second volume of LeGuin's \\"Earthsea Trilogy\\", the wizard Sparrowhawk (Ged) returns, but only in the latter half of the book.  The story first centers around Tenar,  who at the tender age of five is taken from her parents to the Place of the Tombs in the deserts of Atuan and renamed Arha, \\"the Eaten One\\".  Born on the same day that the head priestess of the cult worshipping the Nameless Ones died, she is designated to be the cult's new leader.  Much of the first part of the novel is introspective, revolving around Arha's loneliness and her days in the darkness of the tombs.  Imprisoned by the cult, as she matures she struggles with the legitimacy of the cult which revolves around her, and her own identity.  It's a journey from the darkness of her oppressive religion to the light of freedom and truth.<br />At this point Ged arrives, but only as a supporting character.  Ged is on a quest to obtain the other half of a magic amulet.  Together, he and Arha complete the quest and make the journey to a new beginning.  But the novel's real focus is Arha, and her journey from bondage to freedom, from childhood to adulthood.  Unlike much other fantasy, LeGuin's books don't revolve around cheap and flashy displays of trivial magic.  In \\"The Tombs of Atuan\\" at least, the magic falls to the background, for the telling of a serious tale about a girl's journey to womanhood.  Even though it's part of a series, this is a story that functions independently in its own right.  Those looking for Harry Potter type fantasy adventure and fun will be disappointed, but for fans of serious fantasy and characterization this is not to be missed.  It's no wonder that this title won the Newberry Award. -GODLY GADFLY	2003-08-05

And I've read enough short stories to know that writing a *good* short story is a tremendously difficult art.  The writers of this collection may have proved themselves at writing novels, with successful Christian novelists such as Karen Kingsbury, Randy Alcorn, Angela Elwell Hunt, Terri Blackstock, Jerry B. Jenkins, Sigmund Brouwer and others all trying their hand at the shorter form of writing.  These writers collectively are members of ChiLibris, an organization of Christian novelists, with all royalties going to the evangelistic efforts of the JESUS Film Project.  The stories themselves have the theme of international settings and travel, and like the novels of these writers seek to focus our attention on eternal spiritual truths.  Their ambitions and intentions may be noble, but that doesn't mean that they are guaranteed to write good short stories.  Fortunately, they themselves are not very pretentious, as is evident from the introduction.<br />The collection of 29 stories as a package is rather so-so, with many rather \\"ordinary\\" stories that fail to stir emotion or the heart.  But there are a few outstanding efforts that are certainly worth reading.  Probably the three best stories in the collection are Randy Alcorn's \\"Is This The Day?\\" which although weighed down by excessive informative detail, is a thrilling story about persecution in China with a suspenseful climactic twist; Athol Dickson's \\"Hannah's Home\\", a stunning tale of the love of an adoptive mother with a breath-taking twist; and Robin Jones Gunn's \\"Innocent as Doves\\", which makes you appreciate the riches of having your own copy of the Bible with a realistic tale about Bible smuggling in East Europe in the days of communism.  Not quite on the same level, but also relatively good are Terri Blackstock's \\"So Shine\\", a fascinating and gripping conversion story which looks at a Christian from the point of view of an unbeliever; Robert Elmer's \\"Maren's Flag\\", a story about two women's misunderstanding of each other; Angela Hunt's \\"The Farthest Countries\\" which runs the danger of being trite, but describes heaven and hell in terms of real estate; and Karen Kingsbury's \\"A Reason To Live\\", a story of God's special providence involving a baby girl in a Russian orphanage.<br />The rest of the stories in this collection, however, were nothing more than ordinary at best.  I also encountered various theological difficulties, on numerous points where the theology of the authors clearly differed from my own, and this naturally also detracted from my enjoyment.  Examples include views on grace, ecumenism, revelation, universalism, forgiveness, lotteries and angels.  Is it worth it?  Perhaps for the few outstanding stories, but aside from these if you miss this collection you don't miss much. Volume 2 in this series is a much better buy.  -GODLY GADFLYbout two women's misunderstanding of each other; Angela Hunt's \\"The Farthest Countries\\" which runs the danger of being trite, but describes heaven and hell in terms of real estate; and Karen Kingsbury's \\"A Reason To Live\\", a story of God's special providence involving a baby girl in a Russian orphanage.<br />The rest of the stories in this collection, however, were nothing more than ordinary at best.

Ludlum has created a name for himself in the espionage genre by writing fast paced thrillers that entertain - and \\"The Aquitaine Progression\\" certainly fits that mould well.  It's not among his best, but certainly not among his worst novels either.  The plot is occasionally speckled with blasphemy and occasional profanity, the odd immoral tryst (although less so than what I recall from his other books), and regular killings of guys good and bad, but the main feature is the story-line itself.  Unlike some of his other novels, the main plot doesn't revolve around a cold war type scenario, but a world-wide conspiracy theory.  Joel Converse, an American lawyer, is informed of a global conspiracy (code-named \\"Aquitaine\\") to topple the leadership of every major government across the world through a series of carefully calculated military moves.  But Converse quickly discovers that his knowledge is dangerous, and soon he is on the run for his life, because the generals behind the Aquitaine can not afford to let him live.  What follows is typical high speed action from Ludlum, as Converse must flee from the hands of his pursuers, and yet find a way to rescue the world from the impending global violence.  All his ties to help are slowly cut, except that to his former wife.  Together, they must find a way to destroy Aquitaine.  The ending was somewhat of a let down, not featuring any real surprising twist, but this weakness aside, \\"The Aquitaine Progression\\" is a typically fast and entertaining ride, worthy of the name Ludlum on the front cover. -GODLY GADFLY	2003-08-05

After being rather disappointed by the short stories in the first Storytellers' Collection, I was pleasantly surprised by the improved quality of volume two.  Consisting of 37 short stories, it is a collaboration of the members of ChilLibris, successful Christian novelists like Karen Kingsbury, Randy Alcorn, Angela Elwell Hunt, Terri Blackstock, and others.  As with the first volume, the royalties go to a worthwhile organization, in this case Prison Fellowship Ministries, founded by Chuck Colson in 1976.  But while the first volume of stories focused on travelling, these tales are more about hearts and homes.  The change in focus seems to be a successful one - the stories themselves are rather interesting and effective, and not hampered by as many theological problems as those in the first volume.<br />Two of the especially memorable stories were  \\"Fragments of Truth\\" by Carol Cox, which is an excellent mystery story, and \\"Jessica's Gift\\" by Karen Kingsbury, which shows the effect of the gospel on a broken marriage through the eyes of a young girl with cerebral palsy.  But many of the other stories in the collection are also worth reading:<br />Shari MacDonald's \\"Homecoming\\" shows the struggle of a new bride who leaves her husband after six months when she discovers that marriage isn't all a honeymoon.<br />Karen Ball's \\"The Orchard\\" is a must-read to remind fathers of the importance of spending time with family in light of the eternal things that really matter.<br />Jefferson Scott's \\"A Matter of Perspective\\" shows how you can look at an ordinary day in two completely different ways depending on your perspective.<br />Carole Gift Page's \\"Home to Southfiled, Mourning\\" features a husband and wife who discover the isolation between them after a funeral.<br />Lori Copeland's \\"Communication\\" is a humorous tale about a wife who fries her husband's trophy fish.<br />Colleen Coble's \\"Heart Treasure\\" highlights the truth of Matthew 6, as a mother gives up her baby for adoption and must choose between giving her child Christian parents, or gaining wealth for herself.<br />Neta Jackon's \\"Fences\\" is an extended metaphor about taking down fences and building bridges between people.<br />Athol Dickson's \\"The Coward\\" uses the story of a boy whose love for his grandfather overcomes his fear of heights to illustrate the Scriptural idea that \\"Perfect love drives out fear\\" (1Jn 4:18).<br />Terri Blackstock's \\"The Blue Convertible\\" puts a face on a criminal and through the eyes of a young girl helps the reader to identify with a prisoner.<br />Patricia Hickman's \\"Diary of a Farmer's Wife\\" is an allegory that shows how the bride of Christ often acts like a woman who lives her life selfishly and throws away the most precious treasure of all.<br />Randy Alcorn's \\"Brothers\\" in true Alcorn style demonstrates the importance of living for eternity and heaven, in a situation between two detached brothers whose father dies.<br />Judith McCoy-Miller's \\"In The Matter of Grace\\" portrays a widow who learns to deal with grief and see her blessings.<br />These stories are probably the highlights of the collection.  They may be fiction, but the spiritual values and truths that they underline are very real.

US	51067904	R3VFBP56XBF6GD	0060926317	318377142	Mutant Message Down Under	Books	1	16	22	N	N	Marlo Morgan's gospel: The emperor's new clothes	At first read, this is the fictional story of an American woman who is adopted by a group of aboriginals in the Australian desert, and journeys with them across the country, learning and assimilating the culture of these Real People on the way.  Yet beneath the surface this novel is much more than that.  That much is evident alone from the immense controversy it has generated, and the strongly contrasting passions of praise or criticism it has aroused.  Why all the fuss?<br />Its because of the thinly veiled message that the author conveys with her story.  The story itself is not even that well written, but more important than the story is the message.  Marlo Morgan is convinced that there is something wrong with the people of the modern world, which she describes as mutants, in contrast to the aboriginal Real People who are Gods first people, the only true human beings left on the planet.  But Morgan goes a step further when she presents the lifestyle of the Real People as the answer to the problems of mankind.  By following the principles of the Real People, Morgan proclaims that paradise is possible. Mans own saviour is himself.  Mankind can save themselves from evil, and create paradise on earth.<br />Essentially this is new age philosophy rather thinly disguised, plain and simple, the new age gibberish of modern times.  Not surprising, theres also mention of typical new age techniques like palm reading, mental telepathy, and healing.  Conveniently, the Real People are mouthpieces for Morgans own new age philosophy, and cleverly lend an authority and credibility to her ideas that would not be present if she were to just proclaim it herself.<br />As a result, this book is much more than an interesting story.  Morgan makes no secret that she wants the world to adopt the practices of the Real People.  They made me their spokesperson and she is the mutant messenger preaching the Real Peoples gospel.  By the conclusion of the book, the proclamation of the new age gospel becomes increasingly explicit. We do not judge the Mutants.   We pray they will look closely at their actions, at their values, and learn before it is too late that all life is one.  We pray they will stop the destruction of the earth and of each other.  We pray there are enough Mutants on the brink of becoming real to change things.  We pray the Mutant world will hear and accept our messenger.  Its evident that Marlo Morgan wants us all to become converted new agers, seek salvation from within ourself, and so bring about paradise on earth.  Essentially her story is the good news to mankind, a new age Bible, disguised as a novel.<br />Its a clever idea, because what Marlo Morgan has essentially done is wrap the central tenets of new age philosophy in a package, and cloaked them with the apparent authority of an ancient aboriginal tribe hidden in the desert.  The authority cannot be challenged because the tribe is in hiding and about to vanish forever.  Its all very wonderful - if its true.  But what if the story isnt true and the Real People dont even exist?  The authenticity of the events she describes critically important: is the emperor really wearing any clothes or not?<br />It doesnt take much to see that the emperor doesnt have any clothes, and to realize that the story is a fabrication.  Morgan  an American - gives herself away by attributing several characteristics to the Real People that are distinctly North American rather than Australian, such as the use of spider-webs as dreamcatchers and headresses with feathers (concepts familiar to North American Indians, but completely foreign to Australian aboriginals). As an Australian myself, its easy to see that many claims she makes about aboriginals and Australia are simply untrue.  There is a complete lack of substantial corroborative evidence for the events Morgan describes. Not surprisingly, the book has sparked loud cries of outrage from Australian aboriginals, who calling it an insulting hoax, and claim that there is no evidence that Marlos journey ever took place.  A group of aboriginal leaders even received support from the Australian government to travel to North America to prevent the book from becoming a movie.  In response to the outcry from Aboriginals at their culture being exploited and misrepresented in order to endorse new age ideas to gullible Americans, Marlo Morgan has reportedly apologized and acknowledged that her apparent experiences were fiction and a fraudulent fabrication.<br />Ultimately the ideas of the Real People about consciousness and positive thinking are just too conveniently identical those proclaimed by contemporary new age gurus.  Todays new age prophets  not the Real People  are the real inspiration behind this book, and those with a passion for new age ideas and an ignorance about Australia are its victims.  Cloaking modern new age ideas with the apparent authority of an ancient people is a mean and nasty trick, but the prudent will see through the deceit and realize the naked truth that the emperor isnt wearing any clothes and he isnt very pretty.  The gospel of the mutant messenger is a false gospel, its prophet a false prophet. There really is no need to go on a vicarious journey with Marlo Morgan and be enlightened, because her apparent enlightenment is only another form of spiritual darkness.  Certainly there are problems with our modern world, and Morgan has highlighted some of them, but the answer to this darkness is not a false gospel, but the true gospel which alone gives the lasting solution to sin.  Its prophets do not proclaim the emperors new clothes, but about the kings clothes, clothes of righteousness which offer lasting salvation for all who believe. -GODLY GADFLYng it an insulting hoax, and claim that there is no evidence that Marlos journey ever took place.

US	51067904	R3AVO1IWFOYR7	0140439072	441055186	The Sign of Four (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	The science of deduction embodied in one man.	Published in 1890, \\"The Sign of Four\\" was Doyle's second work, featuring the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes.  The first chapter is appropriately titled \\"The Science of Deduction\\", and serves as a wonderful introduction to the enigmatic man and his methods.  Holmes asserts that there are \\"three qualities necessary for the ideal detective\\", namely knowledge, the power of observation, and the power of deduction.  Holmes' abilities at observation are superb, as evidenced by some of the books he's produced on obscure topics like the tracing of footsteps, the influence of a trade on the form of a hand, or the enumeration of 140 forms of cigar, cigarette and pipe tobacco ash.  He is careful to distinguish mere observation from clear deductive reasoning, and it is the latter which really is the essence of Holmes.  To him the only thing that is important is \\"the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes\\" by which he unravels a case.  Already in the opening, he demonstrates his powers of deduction by coming to stunning and perfectly logical conclusions about Watson's brother, merely by seeing his watch.  What is obscure to everyone, is of course perfectly obvious to Holmes: \\"so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous.\\"  He is the epitomy of deduction and cold hard reason.<br />While Holmes is the embodiment of reason, Watson is the embodiment of emotion.  Holmes is naturally critical of the emotional and romantic streak in Watson.  \\"Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner.\\"  When Watson comments on the attractiveness of Holmes' client, he replies \\"Is she?  I did not observe.\\"  Completely deprived of emotion, he looks not at beauty, but at cold hard facts.  \\"It is of the first importance not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities ... The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning.\\"  In this story Watson finds himself a wife, something Holmes would never consider: \\"...love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things.  I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment.\\"  Fortunately we need not share Holme's cold and emotionless tastes to love him, because we are involved in the story through the first person narrative of Watson, who has more than enough emotion and romance to make up for what Holmes lacks. Watson is a brilliant literary device for Doyle, because it enables us to portray Holmes with his cold logic without having to identify with him.  Instead we identify with Watson as passive observers and view Holmes himself as a curious object to be marvelled at.<br />We need not identify with Holmes to appreciate his passion for deduction.  In \\"The Sign of Four\\" Holmes applies his powers of deduction to a remarkable case involving Mary Morstan, whose father disappeared under mysterious circumstances some ten years earlier.  Investigation uncovers the facts of his death, and the suprising discovery that he has bequeathed her a tremendous treasure.  The plot thickens as the treasure disappears along with a classic locked-room murder mystery.  Mysterious notes with \\"The Sign of Four\\" seem to be the only clue to the mystery.  Of course only Holmes can and does unravel the mystery, even when all the other police detectives are desperately misled by both clues and lack of reason.  As usual Holmes will cooperate with them, but only on his terms: \\"You are welcome to all the official credit, but you must act on the lines that I point out.\\"<br />As with \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", we're again introduced to the elements that typify a Sherlock Holmes story.  Holmes utilizes \\"the unofficial force - the Baker Street irregulars\\" to help him. They consist of a dozen dirty and ragged little street Arabs, whom Holmes pays in return for information gleaned from the streets.  \\"They can go everywhere, see everything, overhear everyone.\\"  Holmes also utilizes the power of disguise, which he expertly uses to even pull the wool over the eyes of his companion Watson.  But \\"The Sign of Four\\" also gives a glimpse of Holmes' weakness - an addiction to morphine and cocaine.  The justification is that he only resorts to the use of drugs when he is not busy with a case.  \\"My mind rebels at stagnatism.\\"  \\"Hence the cocaine.  I cannot live without brainwork.\\"  He much prefers the mental challenge of a case \\"...it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine.\\"  But just as Holme's intellectual brilliance stimulates himself, so it stimulates the reader.  In the process of his deductions, he evidences an astute understanding of people, articulating gems like this: \\"The chief proof of man's real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness.\\"  On carefully asking people the right questions: \\"The main thing with people of that sort is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you.  If you do they will instantly shut up like an oyster.\\" On women: \\"Women are never to be entirely trusted - not the best of them.\\" And as with most mysteries, as readers we are reminded of what lengths the passions of greed and revenge will go in corrupting human behaviour.<br />As in all the Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes himself unquestionably emerges the hero.  However, Doyle had not yet perfected the Sherlock Holmes formula, because in the lengthy extended flashback of the final chapter as the murderer describes his story Holmes himself falls to the background.  The truth is, we want more of Holmes and his deduction, and that's what Doyle perfected in his later short stories.  But if deduction is indeed a science as Holmes believes, then he himself is its greatest scientist, and there are few pleasures greater than seeing this enigmatic scientist at work in the laboratory of life. -GODLY GADFLYower of disguise, which he expertly uses to even pull the wool over the eyes of his companion Watson.

I've not read the original editor's cut version of 1978, only the huge uncut version published in 1990 with 150,000 words added.  At an imposing 1100+ pages in paperback, it may be surprising that this novel is regarded as King's best. But while King's usual fare is to indulge in horror, in \\"The Stand\\" he goes far beyond that.  There is some horror, but it is not the focus, since this novel is far broader and more epic than that.  The length enables it to be peopled with vivid characters and events that lend it much credibility and colour.  Essentially it's an apocalyptic \\"end-of-the-world\\" type story, as a contagious and lethal super-flu bug escapes from a US Defence Department lab facility where it was created, and spreads around the world in epidemic proportions, killing over 99% of the world's population.  The survivors gradually pool themselves into two distinct groups and pit themselves against each other in a final stand of good versus evil.  King divides the story into three books, Book 1 entitled \\"Captain Trips\\" describing the spread of the superflu; Book 2 entitled \\"On The boarder\\" describing the struggles and polarization of the survivors; Book 3 entitled \\"The Stand\\" describing the final conflict.<br />I personally did not care for the blasphemy, profanity, immorality and crude sexual talk, and bloody gore that occasionally was present, but fortunately these elements were less evident as the novel progressed.  But these are made up by the novel's real strengths: a well-paced and suspenseful plot, and splendid characterization.  The characters are vivid and believable, especially those such as Stuart Redmond, the only survivor of those at the gas station where the initial outbreak of the superflu occurred; Frannie Goldsmith, a pregnant teen; Nick Andros, a deaf-mute; Larry Underwood, a musician on the verge of success; Glen Bateman and his dog Kojak; Tom Cullen, retarded but useful; Harold Lauder, the eccentric devotee of Frannie; Donald Merwin Elbert, better known as the pyromaniac Trash Can Man, and Abagail Freemantle, the 108 year old black Christian with a deep faith.<br />But the novel's real strength is the clear conflict between good and evil.  On the side of good, the ancient Abagail Freemantle becomes a spiritual leader and guide as the good guys try to reorganize society and take their stand against evil.  Chief on the side of evil is the mysterious Randall Flagg, otherwise known as \\"the Dark Man\\" and \\"the Walkin' Dude\\", and his associates which include the thug Lloyd Henreid and others, and who also succeeds in gaining the allegiance of Harold Lauder and Nadine Cross.  The spiritual nature of the conflict is especially evident in \\"the Adversary\\" Randall Flagg, who is clearly portrayed as a supernatural being with special powers and \\"the devil's pawn\\".  In contrast, Abagail Freemantle frequently quotes the Bible, asserting the need to \\"Trust and obey the Word of God\\".  The Stand thus is essentially an apocalyptic tale of spiritual proportions: \\"we are all part of a chess game between God and Satan; Satan's chief agent in this game is the Adversary, whose name she says is Randall Flagg...for reasons best known to Himself, God has chosen her as His agent in this matter.\\"  As the people of Boulder (on the side of good) and of Las Vegas (on the side of evil) take their final stand, much more is at stake than personal conflict.<br />The spiritual tale is not without flaws, notably two: Firstly, those on the side of good also indulge in evil behaviour, such as immorality; Secondly, King's conclusion presents history as circular (confirmed by titling the prologue and epilogue as \\"The Circle Opens\\" and \\"The Circle Closes\\") where people do not learn from the past.  In reality, history is linear, and the Messiah will accomplish an apocalyptic victory by completely destroying evil - this truly religious and Biblical answer is missing from King's novel.  But even so, the apocalyptic themes and Biblical imagery that King frequently draws upon, makes this a very interesting and entertaining read.  It's little wonder that it stands out from the rest of Stephen King's works, and deserves the respect it has earned.

Named after its protagonist Noel Holcroft, \\"The Holcroft Covenant\\" is easily among Ludlum's top novels.<br /><br />Holcroft is an American son of a high-ranking Nazi, who is shown the surprising document called \\"The Holcroft Covenant\\", to which he is the key.  Under its stipulations which Noel must implement, second generation Jews are to receive the immense sum of $780 million from three high ranking and apparently repentant Germans including Noel's father, as an expression of regret for the atrocities of the Second World War. But this covenant is not quite what it seems, and soon Noel finds himself in the middle of the hostile operations of several competing groups: The Odessa - a pro-Nazi group; The Rache - a radical Jewish group aimed at taking revenge against the Germans; the Nachrichtendienst - another Jewish group with different aims; and the mysterious Wolfsschanznze - an old alliance of Germans which for some reason seems to be supporting Holcroft.  And who is unleashing the final stage of the covert \\"Operation Sonnenkinder\\", which seeks to establish the Fourth Reich by channelling these funds to Nazi children which were hidden throughout the world at the end of the war?<br /><br />The action is somewhat less than Ludlum's staple, but the overdose of suspense and intrigue more than makes up for it!  It's still a fast-paced page-turner like Ludlum's other novels, because the suspense is second to none, with constant twists and turns as Noel struggles to survive and to unravel the twisted strands of events going on around him. Expect plenty of surprises!  The Holcroft Covenant is another terrific Ludlum read! -GODLY GADFLY	2003-08-05

Mara is an Egyptian slave with a cruel master.  But her life is about to change dramatically as she gains a new owner and embarks on a thrilling adventure to the highest places in Egypt.  \\"She was free, free to walk out that door, make her way unchallenged to the wharf, and set sail for Abydos, Thebes - adventure.  No more rags.  No more beatings or loaf snatching.  No more hunger!  Instead there would be luxury and royal intrigue and excitement...\\"  It's an adventure that you can share by reading her story - one you will not want to miss!<br />The story is set in ancient Egypt, during the reign of Queen Hatshepshut, with the imminent ascent of her half-brother Prince Thuthmose to become Pharaoh.  The change of Mara's fortunes begins when she is suddenly purchased by Nahereh, a loyal follower of the Queen who has observed her potential.  He elevates her to an important position as intepreter for Prince Thuthmose's foreign bride, so that she can uncover who in the Queen's house are loyal to her rival Prince Thuthmose.  \\"In short, I am a spy.\\" \\"Exactly.\\" But before she begins her task as secret agent, she is approached by the noble Sheftu, to act as his secret messenger to Thuthmose.  So she becomes a double agent.  \\"For the second time in one week she was being threatened with her life, being maneuvered with almost identical phrases into the position of spy and intriguer - and by two who were deadly enemies fighting in opposing camps, for opposing causes!\\"  \\"She herself would become the messenger she had been ordered to discover and betray.\\" So begins a thrilling tale about Mara's fortunes, which are inextricably tied together with the fortunes of all of Egypt!  Will she be exposed?  And will Thuthomse succeed in overthrowing Queen Hatshepshut?  What will happen to Mara?<br />Are there weaknesses?  Perhaps.  The constant use of phrases such as \\"the devil take him\\" seemed more a reflection of twentieth century expletives than ancient Egypt.  And Mara has one weakness of character that one wouldn't want readers emulating.  Mara's rebellious attitude to her master is not exactly exemplary.  And she seems driven by a quest for freedom and wealth.  \\"Nobody must stand in the way of her possessing such things always, freedom and gold and a life worth living.\\" When the fate of Egypt is in her hands, her choice is not directed by what is best for Egypt, but by what is best for herself.  \\"Why not play both ends against the middle - serve both, meanwhile serving only herself?\\"  However, this contrasts with the motives of many of the other characters, who are willing to die for the well-being of Egypt - \\"I do it for Egypt.\\"  With Inanni's help, perhaps Mara herself learns to share this conviction towards the end of the novel, rather being led merely by her feelings of self-preservation or romantic love.<br />But these minor blemishes don't detract significantly from a stellar book which I really can't speak highly enough about.  This novel excels on several levels. The setting is portrayed with authenticity and realism, geographically, culturally and religiously, and is both captivating and convincing.  The characterization is superb, both with respect to the protagonist Mara herself, as well as the sypathetic manner in which the Babylonian princess Inanni is portrayed, as a stranger in a strange land, and to whom Mara becomes a confidant.  McGraw also has a perceptive insight into human nature, as is evident from the comment that everyone can be bought with money, the only difference being the price.  The language is descriptive and eloquent, with one memorable metaphor about a hawk and a lark especially outstanding.  But the real strength is the suspenseful plot full of espionage.  When all these elements are combined with a mystery-thriller of a story, it's the formula for a page-turning success!  Particularly enjoyable for young girls, it's enjoyable for people of all ages.  It may a story that's fifty years old, but it brings you farback in time to ancient Egypt, and will continue to entertain for a long time into the future! -GODLY GADFLYback in time to ancient Egypt, and will continue to entertain for a long time into the future! -GODLY GADFLY	2003-08-05

While the prequel \\"Danger in the Shadows\\" was 25% suspense and 75% romance, the first official entry in Dee Henderson's popular \\"O'Malley\\" series sees a welcome switch of the figures: 75% suspense and only 25% romance.  The main plot of this mystery concerns hostage negotiator Kate O'Malley and FBI agent Dave Richman (brother of the protagonist Sara from the prequel), who together unravel the mystery involving a bank robbery crisis, a bombed aeroplane, a family member from Kate's past, and various mysterious threats against Kate's life.  This suspense thriller plot dominates the novel, generating strong interest and resulting in a real page-turner.  The only real weaknesses is that the solution is rather complex and at times frustratingly hard to follow, and the clues given on the first page of chapter four are enough for astute readers to figure out whodunnit, preventing them from being misled by the red herrings which rest suspicion on a different character.  And the characterization isn't very deep (both Kate and Dave are rather too bold and beautiful to be believeable), but it's the storyline which really drives this book.  On the whole, the main plot is immensely satisfying, and carried me from the beginning of the novel to the end.<br />Besides the main plot, there are three sub-plots: 1. Romance - the relationship between Kate and Dave; 2. Religion - Kate's journey to becoming a Christian; 3. Sickness - the cancer of Kate's sister, which is left hanging and not resolved at the end of this book (as well as related questions about unanswered prayer).  Unlike the prequel, these sub-plots do not weigh down or detract from the main suspense.  Just as with the first book, I had a few questions about the Christian elements, such as attitudes towards Sunday rest and entertainment.  I was pleasantly surprised to notice that Dave at the outset did not want to get into a relationship with someone who was not a believer, although disappointingly this didn't seem to put the brakes on the way he grew closer to Kate as the novel progressed, and that he wasn't able to stay entirely true to his principles by allowing himself to fall in love with her.  But unlike other Christian novelists, the focus was neither romance nor an artificial conversion story (the conversion itself wasn't very plausible, but there are certainly some interesting apologetics!).  In fact, it was refreshing to see some often misunderstood Biblical truths very clearly stated: \\"It wasn't his job to convince her to believe.  God knew best how to draw her to Him.\\"  \\"He is both just and merciful in equal measure.\\"  \\"God didn't shortchange justice to grant mercy.  He paid the full price Himself.\\" In her post word, Hendersoon remarks that the relationship between justice and mercy is one of the questions that was central in her mind as she wrote the novel: \\"I was curious to find out which would be more powerful - a need for justice or a need for mercy - if the dilemma became very personal.  I sketched a story that let me explore the subject, and found Kate's journey through the questions fascinating.\\"  These questions were not central to the novel (they seemed to be more questions about Christ rather than the characters themselves), but they were certainly not dealt with an an unsatisfactory manner as has been the case in other Christian novels I've read.  Closely related to this theme is the Bible verse that Henderson begins the novel with: \\"For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost\\" (Luke 19:10), about which one of the characters says \\"Part of the mystery of salvation is that to save the lost, us, Jesus had to die in our place.\\"<br />But while the theology is there, Henderson doesn't make the mistake as some other Christian novelists, and focuses mainly on the plot.  And she's right in doing so, because we don't firstly pick up her book to read theology, but to read a good story.  And a good story is certainly what she delivers (although not as successfullyas Terri Blackstock), while reminding her readers of God's justice and mercy in Christ in the process.  The good news is that Kate is merely the first of the O'Malley family, seven siblings from an orphanage who became a family by changing their name to O'Malley, and that Henderson has a book on each other member of the family.

Reading a book that is well-established as a classic offers both risks and rewards.  The risk is that one's expectations might be too high, leading to disappointment.  The reward is that the book matches expectations, leading to thorough satisfaction.  Reading Kenneth Grahame's \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" is certainly rewarding, but also risky.  It's unquestionably a classic, popularized in part by A.A. Milne's dramatization in 1929 under the name \\"Toad of Toad Hall.\\"  Quite honestly, expecting a child-like story, I found it on a higher level altogether, and perhaps even best appreciated by teens and older readers.  It has a poetical lyrical quality that could discourage younger readers from completing it on their own.<br />But that aside, it's not hard to see why this book has stood the test of time.  Especially the talking animal protagonists are outstanding.  Shy and loyal Mole, clever and courageous Rat, gruff and gentlemanly Badger, and arrogant, adventurous and crazed Toad - the animal characters that populate Grahame's novel are thoroughly individual, real, and loveable, despite their individual quirks.  They are distinctly animal-like, and yet aspects of their life (food - transport - clothing) are distinctly human, enabling us to identify with them quickly and easily and yet be charmed by their differences. Toad does ultimately repent from his conceited egotism \\"Henceforth I will be a very different Toad\\", although we cannot help get the feeling that this is not the first time he has embarked on a road of repentance only to be ambushed again by his old nature. All of this is portrayed with poetic lyricism, as well as warm sympathy and humour.<br />There is something here for everyone. When the friends aren't lazily floating down the river or indulging their appetites, they are worrying about Toad's latest escapades with motor-boats or automobiles.  Readers will find themselves attracted to the rustic, quiet and cozy life of companionship on the river, or else the neverending action that ensues as Toad follows his selfish passions and gets himself into trouble and the climax as Toad and his friends seek to recapture Toad Hall from evil weasels, ferrets and stoats.  While the final battle offers thrills, Toad's \\"education\\" is undoubtedly a good lesson for us all.  Grahame's animal world offers much food for thought for humans in the real world.  Visiting this fantasy world is not escapist, because it better equips us to live in the real world.<br />If there is any criticism, it might be that the novel does not work the aspects of introspection and adventure together cohesively and so does not always function well as a whole.  The shift from pastoral introspection to madcap adventure and back is at times too great.  But even if the snap-shots of \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" 's fantasy world are somewhat fragmented, in the end it's the characters of this world that make it so convincing and successful.  With their successful combination of idyllic companionships and adventurous mishaps, Mole, Rat, Badger and Toad will continue to make new friends of readers in years to come. -GODLY GADFLYthe neverending action that ensues as Toad follows his selfish passions and gets himself into trouble and the climax as Toad and his friends seek to recapture Toad Hall from evil weasels, ferrets and stoats.

The adventure revolves around Murdo Ranulfson, whose brothers and father leave Scotland to join one of the eleventh century Crusades to rescue Jerusalem from the infidel.  When usurpers confiscate his home and property, Murdo leaves his native land and his new bride Ragna, to find his father and brothers and call them to return home and restore their property.  Together with three mysterious priests, his quest takes him to the center of the crusaders' action in sacking Jerusalem in 1099, where he soon becomes part of the search for the iron lance, the relic which apparently pierced Christ's side and now seems to magically guarantee the crusaders victory.  Juxtoposed with Murdo's personal quest, is the much larger and epic story of the crusade.<br />In place of Lawhead's usual fantasy, \\"The Iron Lance\\" instead is full of historical adventure.  But unfortunately Lawhead doesn't succeed in this effort at historical fiction to the same extent as he did in \\"Byzantium\\".  There are too many loose ends, coincidences, and implausibilities.  Unlike some of his other efforts, here the bad guys are neatly vanquished and the good guy gets the gold, the glory, and the girl.  The Iron Lance lacks the deep and contrasting passions of glory and tragedy that I came to love from the Pendragon Cycle and the Song of Albion trilogy. And the framing device about Gordon Murray who is initiated into a mystical nineteenth century secret society of brotherhood has little obvious connection with the rest of the book.  Ultimately it is a rather incredible historical adventure set in medieval times, somewhat too good to be true, where you must suspend you sense of disbelief to enjoy the plot, somewhat similar to Louis L'Amour's \\"The Walking Drum\\" but without the same success in execution and failing to live up to its potential.<br />Certainly there are some aspects that redeem this book.  The portrayal of the crusades is fascinating for those interested in medieval times.  Lawhead is not afraid to show the corruption that existed within the ritualistic church of the time, and the brutality and bloodshed of the crusades.  But amidst all the religion and the politics, this book lacks the personalities, the passion and the plot that made some of his other works so successful, and compared with them is only second rate. Newcomers to Lawhead would do better to start with Byzantium, or the Pendragon Cycle and the Song of Albion trilogies.  I hope the other two entries in this series will rise to the heights Lawhead has reached in the past with those titles. -GODLY GADFLY.<br />Certainly there are some aspects that redeem this book.

A Christian version of suspense queen Mary Higgins Clark?  Terri Blackstock's skill at writing suspense fiction reminded me much of the mystery queen.  \\"Evidence of Mercy\\" (available as a separate novel, or as one of four best-selling Blackstock novels in the \\"Suncoast Chronicles\\" anthology) is a humdinger of a suspense story, revolving around the lives of three main characters.  The main protagonist, Lynda, is a Christian lawyer whose life is threatened by an unknown killer.  The second central character is the atheist Jake, who becomes a paraplegic after crashing on Lynda's sabotaged plane while test-flying it as a prospective buyer.  The third main character is one of Lynda's clients, Paige, a single parent trying to avoid her abusive ex-husband.  Suspense mounts as the mystery killer and his motive remain unidentified in the first half of the story.<br />The first story in this collection, \\"Evidence of Mercy\\", is a terrific and captivating story that draws you in, and at the same time gives you much to think about, because the characters not only battle a mysterious killer, but also their own personalities and weaknesses.  Much Christian fiction falls into the trap of featuring an artificial conversion story.  Terri Blackstock shows that writers can craft a mouth-watering Christian story without artificially sprinkling it with an obvious theological twist of this kind, and yet retain a deeper spiritual significance.  In the afterword, Blackstock explains that the idea of her book came after a personal struggle with her faith, and the growing awareness that faith needs to be put into action.  \\"I thought I believed, I said I believed - but I did nothing to put the belief into action.  I was neither hot nor cold, but luke-warm, and absolutely fruitless.\\"  The title \\"Evidence of Mercy\\" describes this important spiritual theme that Blackstock wants to convey.  The struggles of the three characters mirror Blackstock's own struggles, as she explains: \\"the characters interested me because their own spiritual battles were so much like my own: Lynda, a lukewarm Christian who would let someone die without witnessing to him; Jake, an agnostic who couldn't give up the pilot's seat in his life until it was taken from him; and Paige, a spiritual infant on the verge of belief, who lacked the faith to make the final plunge.\\"  For instance, Lynda comes to conclude \\"she'd made a god of an airplane, an altar of her job, and an idol of her ego\\" (p.38), and Jake realizes the folly of relying on his good looks: \\"If I'd known I was going to be left with just my character, I'd have worked harder at building some.\\" (p.135)  Without taking on an preaching tone that many Christian writers unwittingly do, Blackstock brings out these important spiritual truths by showing them in the lives of her characters in a convincing and persuasive manner.  The other three stories in this anthology are equally good.  In fact, I find them to be on a higher level than Dee Henderson's popular books.<br />Terri Blackstock's novels are a welcome addition to the ranks of Christian fiction.  The genre has been dominated especially by the historical romance, much of it inferior to secular fictions on most levels.  With her successful efforts in suspense fiction genre, Terri Blackstock shows that it doesn't have to be that way (aside from an unnecessary kiss in the last pages), and that Christian writers can successfully take on new genres, and do so with style.

The protagonist Meg is a rather plain and ordinary looking girl from a rather extraordinary family.  Meg's father and mother are brilliant scientists, and her father has been away for a considerable time on a secret government mission.  But things start happening when that \\"dark and stormy night\\" brings the other-worldly Mrs. Whatsit to Meg's home, with her mysterious comment:  \\"by the way, there *is* such a thing as a tessseract.\\" (p18).  A tesseract, we discover, is a fifth dimension which enables instantaneous travel to different places in the universe (p72).  Meg, her genious five-year old brother Charles Wallace, and their new friend Calvin O'Keefe, are joined by Mrs. Watsit and her two companions, the classic-quoting Mrs. Which and the stammering Mrs. Who (whom Calvin later describes as \\"Guardian angels!  Messengers of God!\\" p179) in a quest to rescue Meg's father.<br />The travellers from earth come to discover that Meg's father is in the center of a \\"grand and exciting battle\\" (p82), a cosmic battle between good and evil, fighting the Dark Thing which also threatens planet earth with its evil: \\"That is why your planet is such a troubled one.\\" (p81)  The wrinkle in time takes them to the planet Camazotz, which seems to be a play on the word \\"comatose\\" because all its inhabitants are victims of thoughtless conformity controlled by one mind, the IT (p132).  Charles Wallace too falls under the spell of the enemy and IT's manipulating mind (p126).  With the help of the three Mrs. Ws, can Meg and Calvin rescue both Meg's father and brother?  Meg can only succeed if she recognizes the saving power of love (p194).<br />As a Christian, L'Engle is clearly using the cosmic battle against the Dark Thing as a metaphor of the battle between the kingdoms of Christ and Satan, with an explicit reference to John 1 that Jesus is the light shining in the darkness (p82). There are a few peculiarities, such as the inclusion of the occult in the form of the Happy Medium and her crystal ball on the side of good (p78ff) and the facade of witchcraft employed by the three Mrs Ws, as well as the bizarre list of humans who have fought on the side of good (p82).  But on the whole, astute readers familiar with the Bible will find much deep spiritual meaning in the imagery and language that L'Engle uses.  Charles is vulnerable because \\"he trusted too much to his own strength.\\" (p155)  Despite her weaknesses, Meg is commissioned to rescue Charles because \\"God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.\\" (p189)  \\"But of course we can't take any credit for our talents.  It's how we use them that counts.\\" (p78)  The apparently blind Aunt Beast says: \\"We look not at the things which are what you would call seen, but at the things which are not seen.\\"  And Meg's rejection of common scepticism about her Father's return (\\"Why don't you face facts about your father?\\") resembles the attitude that the Bride of Christ can have to her Bridegroom's return: \\"As long as she says Father *is* coming home, then I'll believe that.\\" (p23)  Meg's mother shares another pearl of wisdom about the humble attitude of believers: \\"I think that with our human limitations we're not always able to understand the explanations.  But you see, Meg, just because we don't understand doesn't mean that the explanation doesn't exist.\\" (p41).<br />Although the profound religious depth gives L'Engle's stories a lasting significance, the facts of theology never overpower the excitement of the fiction.  When combined with identifiable characters, an imaginative and fantastic world, and an exciting plot, this combination of theology, science and fantasy is a formula for success.  It's little wonder that \\"A Wrinkle InTime\\" has proven to be timeless, and worthy of being placed alongside Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, and above Harry Potter.  This story may be forty years old, but it hasn't worn out its pleasure for either children or adults, and after all that time is still a winning story without wrinkles!Time\\" has proven to be timeless, and worthy of being placed alongside Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, and above Harry Potter.

The title \\"A Swiftly Tilting Planet\\" refers to the shifting balance on planet earth, as a result of a titanic struggle between good and evil.  As always, L'Engle employs the Biblical motifs of creation, fall and redemption, beginning with a description of a flawless created world: \\"And then a surge of joy.  All senses alive and awake and filled with joy ... The morning stars sang together and the ancient harmonies were new and it was good.\\" (p50)  But evil enters this perfect world: \\"And then a dazzling star turned its back on the dark, and it swallowed the dark, and in swallowing the dark it became the dark, and there was something wrong with the dark, as there was something wrong with the light.  And it was not good.  The glory of the harmony was broken by screeching, by hissing, by laughter which held no merriment but was hideous, horrendous cacaphony.\\" (p50)  Ultimately the entrance of evil comes with the fall of the angel Satan and his followers: \\"a destroyer, almost since the beginning, has tried to break the ancient harmonies ... The Echthros wanted all the glory for itself, and when that happens the good becomes not good; and others have followed that first Echthros.\\" (p55)  The result brings horrifying consequences for the human race on planet earth: \\"If you are angry, that anger is added to all the hate with which the Echthroi would distort the melody and destroy the ancient harmonies.  When you are loving, that lovingnness joins the music of the spheres.\\" (p60)<br />It is this poetic and religious conflict that forms the background of \\"A Swiftly Tilting Planet\\".  The struggle between good and evil is present in families, and becomes an age-old struggle between brothers: \\"It's a primordial pattern, left us from Cain and Abel, a net we can't seem to break out of.  And unless it is checked it will destroy us entirely.\\" (p235) \\"Once upon a time and long ago, men did not quarrel in this way, when the morning stars sang together and the children of men shouted for joy.\\" (p242)  For the Murry family, first introduced in \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\", this struggle finds expression in the threat of Mad Dog Branzillo, dictator of South American Vespugia, who threatens the world with nuclear war.  On the back of the unicorn Gaudior, fifteen-year-old Charles Wallace Murry travels back through time, to see if he can alter events to a \\"Might-Have-Been\\" and so prevent nuclear war. \\"It would appear that you have been called.  And the calling is never random, it is always according to the purpose.\\" (p54)  Meg Murry, now married to Calvin O'Keefe and an expectant mother, assists Charles Wallace by communicating thoughts through kything.  The unicorn is unable to travel to different places (a Where), but only to a different time (a When) at the same location: the Murry's star-gazing rock.  In these different times, Charles Wallace finds himself \\"Within\\" different individuals, first Harcels, then Madoc, then Brandon Llawcae, then Chuck Maddox, and finally Matthew Maddox.  By influencing their actions, will he be able to alter the course of history by eliminating Mad Dog Branzillo and enable the arrival of the Messianic blue-eyed baby about whom was prophesied? (\\"You will do good for your people, El Zarco, little Blue Eyes\\" p90)  And are they related to Meg's mother-in-law Mrs O'Keefe, and how will her mysterious rune play a role?<br />There are a few weaknesses: L'Engle's theology on one point is questionable (p126).  Meg's presence by kything is rather unnecessary and distracting.  And the family names and connections are rather confusing and difficult to keep track of.  But these minor points aside, \\"A Swiftly Tilting Planet\\" is a welcome return to the brilliance of \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\", with an exciting plot full of adventure and fantasy, as well as deep and enduring themes about the struggle between good and evil.  This may be a children's book, but adults are sure to find a depth that is both entertaining and satisfying.  Those who are no longer teens will probably even enjoy it more than the kiddies!

With \\"An Acceptable Time\\", the \\"Time Quartet\\" (beginning with the award winning \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\") became the \\"Time Quintet\\".  And what a terrific addition to the series this is!  This is certainly one of the more outstanding entries in the series!  Unlike some of the earlier novels, it is not hampered by speculative theology or attempts at Biblical science fiction, but is very much plot driven.  It features an exciting and generally plausible plot where the idea of time travel is central, carrying the suspense until the last pages.  The heroine is Polly O'Keefe, daughter of Meg and Calvin.  Polly is spending the summer with her grandparents, Meg's scientist parents.  Using her familiar twelve-chapter formula, L'Engle describes Polly's adventures as she enters a time gate and goes back 3000 years together with her friend Zachary and her grandparents' friend Bishop Colubra.<br />But as Polly's grandparents remark: \\"Wandering about in time doesn't strike me as particularly safe.\\"  Back in time Polly finds both friends and enemies.  Here she befriends Anaral, Karralys and Tav, part of the People of the Wind, who are in the grip of a tribal struggle with the People Across The Lake.  As she crosses the threshhold of time on several occasions and moves through the circles of time, Polly herself becomes intimately involved in this struggle, because her blood is being sought as the necessary sacrifice in order to bring rain. Can Polly work peace between these two warring peoples?  Can she bring rain and avoid sacrifice?  And what role will the enigmatic Zachary play in the events that follow?  These questions and more result in a spine-chingling tale of suspense and excitement.<br />In the process, L'Engle weaves a tale with important implications about a very real spiritual struggle: \\"The bright angels and the dark angels are fighting, and the earth is caught in the battle.\\"  Even the title itself is derived from Psalm 69:13.  Perhaps more than in the other books, L'Engle affirms the validity of a Christian worldview and the importance of Jesus Christ: \\"I am not turning to the old gods.  No, the God I have tried to serve all my life is still good enough for me.  Christ didn't just appear as Jesus of Nazareth two thousand years ago don't forget.  Christ is, will be, and certainly was ... just as much as now.\\"  Despite the assertion of the the abiding validity of Christianity, L'Engle's apparent acceptance of primitive Celtic religion is still somewhat troubling.  The religion of the People of the Wind in serving \\"Earth Mother\\", \\"The One\\", \\"The Presence\\", \\"The Maker of the Universe\\" is not presented as erroneous paganism, but as a valid and simplistic shadowy form of the true religion.  What particularly made me uncomfortable was the apparent legitimization of various terms and practices in this primitive religion, by the incorporation of occultic elements such as All Hallow's Eve (Samhain).  As in some of the other books, there is a strange and persistent emphasis on the patterns and lines in nature, where \\"The stars will guide you.  Trust them.\\" Polly herself also has no clear perception about the afterlife.  In my view, these elements detracted somewhat from the Christian element of the novel and a consistently Christian worldview.<br />Of the many important themes running through the novel, two especially struck me.  Firstly, the notion of human sacrifice has obvious allusions to Christ's sacrifice.  L'Engle makes this connection explicit, pointing out that the sacrificial death of Jesus was a voluntary act of love \\"I don't think that God demanded that Jesus shed blood unwillingly.  With anguish, yes, but with love.\\"  The parallels with the human sacrifice demanded by the People Across the Lake are not fully worked out, but perhaps they are best understood as a contrast.  They demand that \\"the sacrifice must be unblemished\\" in order to provide healing and rain, but ultimately the sacrifice that saves is not one that is demanded,but given freely in love.  Polly's willingness to return to her captors to attempt to save Zachary typifies such selfless sacrifice.  Unfortunately this important theme is not sufficiently worked out to be entirely successful.  The bishop's words \\"It is never expedient that one man should die for the sake of the country\\" added to the confusion, because they seem to conflict with what John 11:50 says.  Rather than focus on the gospel, L'Engle seems to focus more on the need for us to break down the barriers of division by showing selfless and sacrificial love to others.<br />Secondly, Zachary needs physical healing and hope because of his heart condition, and is terrified of dying.  His physical condition becomes an important metaphor for his need for spiritual renewal from selfishness.  \\"Can you say that only his physical heart was healed?\\"  In working out this important image, L'Engle makes some important observations about the significance of the heart as the source of spiritual growth: \\"The rites themselves cannot give life.  Indeed, they can be hollow and meaningless.  The heart of the people is what gives them life or death.\\"<br />These and other important spiritual themes, as well as a gripping plot, make this novel easily one of the best and most enjoyable reads in the series.  There is a great deal of fantasy here, but what is cloaked in the garb of fantasy are eternal truths, and a great story to boot.

US	51067904	R39PAXMJ3IY8XR	0440227704	598774312	Many Waters (The Time Quartet)	Books	3	12	20	N	N	Biblical science fiction?	In the fourth volume of the highly acclaimed \\"Time Quintet\\", Madeleine L'Engle explores a genre known as Biblical fiction, or in her case: Biblical science fiction.  This genre typically takes a historical narrative from the Bible, and weaves a fictional story around it.  In \\"Many Waters\\", the Biblical element is naturally the waters of the flood.  The \\"fictional\\" element consists of the Murry twins, Sandy and Denny, whose curiosity in the laboratory brings them back in time onto the hot desert sand with Noah and his family shortly before the flood.  In addition to the familiar Biblical characters (Noah, his sons Shem, Ham and Japheth, his father Lamech), here they also meet a host of extra-Biblical characters, notably Yalith, Mahlah, and two other daughters of Noah (p.50), as well as several mythical creatures including pet mammoths, griffins and unicorns.  As to be expected in a work of Biblical fiction, L'Engle also takes artistic license by depicting various events not found in the Bible, such as a family conflict between Noah and his father Lamech.<br />One might already take issue with the idea of crafting a speculative story around a Biblical event.  But L'Engle's chances of pulling this off this successfully is reduced even more by the fact that the Biblical account of the flood includes several difficult exegetical questions.  Readers should be aware that L'Engle's position on these questions is highly questionable.  Firstly Genesis, 6:2 speaks about \\"the sons of God\\" marrying \\"the daughters of men\\".  Although this is commonly interpreted to refer to intermarriage between believers and unbelievers, L'Engle adopts the controversial explanation that this refers to relations between men and angels: \\"winged creatures who sleep with the daughters of men\\" (p.72).  She takes the \\"Nephilim\\" of Genesis 6:4 to be fallen angels who have relations with human women, as opposed to the \\"Seraphim\\" who are the good angels (p.59,96,126,171).  This understanding becomes a foundational element of the novel. However this explanation of Nephilim and Seraphim is highly questionable for various reasons, including the fact that the only seraphim in the the Bible are pictured in heaven and not on earth (Isa. 6), and that the traditional understanding of this Genesis 6 has a great deal to commend it.  Further, the idea that the angels can switch between human form and within an animal host is entirely without any basis (p45-6). Secondly, Genesis 6:3 speaks about man's days being 120 years.  L'Engle takes this to refer to a shortening of life span, rather than a period of 120 years of warning prior to the flood.  Admittedly this is a controversial but certainly not unpopular explanation, and does not really hamper the novel significantly.<br />However, there are also many simple blunders and inaccuracies where it seems that close attention has not been paid to the Biblical text. For instance, Noah's father Lamech is described as dying shortly before the flood, whereas the Bible indicates his death occurred five years earlier (Gen 5:30; 7:11).  And Shem is pictured as a hunter of animals, even though God only gave animals as food after the flood (Gen. 9:3).  The fact that he thanks the animal rather than God is also bizarre (p180-1).  On these points the book goes beyond speculation, and is simply incorrect.  The idea of listening to, obeying and trusting the stars is also somewhat vague and troubling because it lends credence to a form of divine revelation never mentioned in Scripture (p.141, 282).  Perhaps L'Engle's own view of divine revelation accounts for this.  The way the Bible was referred to made me seriously wonder about the author's own view of Scripture: the Bible is described as \\"chauvinistic\\" (p168) and \\"It's supposed to be the Word of God, not written by God.\\" (p169).  Furthermore, the constant to attention to lust and sexual content made me wonder whether this book is really suitable for children.<br />If one can overlook the speculation, the plot itself is well-written and fascinating.  And certainly there are many wholesome ideas and concepts.  The aspect of spiritual war is certainly Biblical, although the portrayal of this war as a battle between the nephilim and seraphim is of course pure speculation.  \\"I think the seraphim like us.  But the others don't ... I mean, the other ones, the nephilim.\\" (p.188)  The twins are involved in this spiritual war, and must resist temptation and maintain their integrity.  The historical redemptive significance of Noah's salvation is correctly pointed out: \\"If the flood had drowned everybody, if the earth hadn't been repopulated, then Jesus would never have been born.\\" (p198).  The ongoing problem of human depravity after the flood is not diminished: \\"We do even worse things to one another because we know more.\\" (p197).  And the title is a very creative application of Song of Solomon 8:7 (\\"Many waters cannot quench love\\") to the waters of the flood (p242,296), although the \\"love\\" is never fully worked out, and the exact significance of the title remains rather obscure even by the end of the book.  In the end, however, I found the whole notion of Biblical fiction with its heavy dependence on speculation rather disturbing.  If there's one book in the Time Quartet that you can afford to miss, it is this one.  You will have to make up your own mind about this, but at the very least you should be aware ahead of time that this is not just a work of fiction, but a work of Biblical science fiction.ulation, the plot itself is well-written and fascinating.

Madeleine L'Engle's award winning \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" stands head and shoulders above this sequel, the second entry in the \\"Time Quintet\\" series.  Unlike the journey to distant galaxies of the first novel, in \\"A Wind in the Door\\" Meg Murray and her friend Calvin O'Keefe's main adventure involves a journey into the minute particles of her brother Charles Wallace, who is deathly ill.  Meg's parents, a brilliant physicist and biologist, have discovered that human cells are made up of mitochondria, and these in turn are composed of farandolae.  A dark power is at work among the farandolae, causing the illness of Charles Wallace, and more seriously threatening to tear up the entire galaxy.  Only by entering one of Charles' mitochondria can Meg save Charles...and the galaxy.<br />In the end, all this talk about mitochondria and farandolae gets a bit much, and the idea of travelling inside someone's body just doesn't have the same magic as travelling to distant galaxies.  The concept of kything (being able to communicate with thoughts, like ESP) had a somewhat new-age flavour that I was not entirely comfortable with.  The idea of Naming (The first of three quests that faces Meg is to Name the school principal Mr. Jenkins) is never entirely fully developed or explained.  The need for a farandola called Sporos to \\"Deepen\\" simply lacked charm.  And the plot is rather complex and weighed down by scientific techno-babble, which many children may find rather frustrating.  As such, this book doesn't come close to matching the fantasy and power of the first novel.<br />But those weaknesses aside, there is also much to commend this book.  There are profound thoughts about the significance of everything having a name, and that the Creator \\"knows them all by name.\\" \\"The stars don't need to be counted. They need to be Named.\\"  In this context, one's size doesn't detract from one's significance, because the tiny elements of the universe such as farandolae are just as important.  The hostile forces are described as echthroi who want to X (annihilate) creation, and L'Engle uses them to picture a cosmic conflict between fallen angels (echthroi) and good angels (such as the dragon-like cherubim Proginoskes). The implied connection, however, between schizophrenia and demon possession (p123) will always be a controversial one.  There are also several profound observations about life and faith.  Memorable quotations that stand out in my mind include these: \\"Love isn't how you feel.  It's what you do.\\" (p116) \\"You have simply been faced with several things outside your current sphere of experience.  That does not mean that they - we - do not exist.\\" (p122).  And the description of immature pleasure-seekers: \\"When we seek our own pleasure as the ultimate good we place ourselves as the center of the universe.  A fara or a man or a star has his place in the universe, but nothing created is the center.\\" (p172).  And in the middle of all this seriousness, there are also moments of subtle humour, such as one instance where L'Engle pokes fun at Charles Darwin's theory of evolution: \\"What I really need are lessons in adaptation.  I've been reading Darwin, but he hasn't helped me much.\\" (p71) This book might not be the best in the series and might not be as captivating as \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\", but it's still a fantastic adventure worth travelling.stile forces are described as echthroi who want to X (annihilate) creation, and L'Engle uses them to picture a cosmic conflict between fallen angels (echthroi) and good angels (such as the dragon-like cherubim Proginoskes).

My siblings and I loved them.  Twenty years later, I still love them.  I was fortunate enough to obtain the three-in-one volume bumper edition of 500 plus pages containing the complete text of three of the six adventures about the magical Faraway Tree: \\"The Enchanted Wood\\", \\"The Magic Faraway Tree\\" and \\"The Folk of the Faraway Tree.\\"  This title is only the first in the series, but do whatever it takes to get hold of it and the others!<br />The adventures begin when three children, Jo, Bessie and Fanny, discover an enchanted wood inhabited by brownies, talking rabbits, and other fantastic creatures in the vicinity of their new country home.  In the center of this wood is the mysterious and magical Faraway Tree, home to the friendly Moonface, adorable Silky, irritable Angry Pixie, cheeky Dame Washalot, and clattery Saucepan Man.  In the homes of their new friends, the children enjoy wonderful treats like magical Pop Biscuits and Toffee Shocks. And any time they want to quickly head down the tree, they grab a cushion and slide down the exciting Slippery Slip.<br />But best of all, at the top of a tree is a white cloud, the mysterious entrance to a magical land above the tree.  In turn, magical lands - good and bad - visit the tree, giving the children opportunities for glorious adventures.  There are wonderful lands that every child dreams about, such as the Land of Take-What-You-Want, the Land of Birthdays, the Land of Toys, the Land of Goodies, the Land of Presents, and the Land of Treats.  But there are also dangerous lands, such as the Land of Topsy-Turvy, the Land of Tempers, the Land of Giants, and the Land of Dame Slap, all of which lead the children into terrible dangers and exciting adventures.<br />My only concern with these tales is that Blyton's focus on material things is not always upbuilding for children, and to dream of imaginary utopian lands of goodies and toys can result in an unwholesome form of materialism.  But on the whole, Blyton takes pains to present positive moral attributes in her characters, and there are definite implicit lessons about virtues and vices.  Similarly, there is a very clear conflict between good and evil.<br />All in all, Enid Blyton's magical world is a delight to children and will hold them spell-bound. Although written in the 1930s and 1940s, these stories have become classics that have stood the test of time, and are just as enjoyable today as ever.  They are not deep, but they are enchanting, and this is the perfect book to read aloud to your children.  They'll beg you to read it again and again.  Come to think of it, as an adult, you'll secretly be glad of the opportunity to read it again yourself!

That's exactly what the legendary Russian writer Dostoevsky does in this classic novel.  On the face of it, by the usual standards of literature, this doesn't seem to be much of a novel.  There isn't much in the way of plot (the murder happens in the early pages, we know who he is from the outset, and the only real suspense revolves around whether or not he will confess).  The language is at times awkward and complex.  The setting is believable but not captivating.  But the people are, and here Dostoevsky excels: characterization.  The focus of the novel revolves around the internal struggle within the murderer's mind, as he deals with the consequences of his action as a moral being.  Most modern murder mysteries seek to entertain by focusing on the blood and gore; Dostoevsky goes far deeper by focusing on the mind.<br />Dostoevsky has a deep insight into human nature and psychology.  In the process of wading through the text, one can expect to come across wonderful pearls like these: \\"I have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on with their mothers-in-law.\\" (p37) \\"Even the poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving.\\" (p350)  \\"And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind?\\" (p386)<br />This insight into human behaviour especially becomes evident in Dostoevsky's treatment of the murderer Raskolnikov. Many writers are one-dimensional, but Dostoevsky shows how people have a complex system of emotions, often fluctuating from one feeling to the next.  He depicts human nature with different layers and moods, as Raskolnikov moves between conflicting emotions such as fear, guilt, remorse, and courage.  The brilliance is already evident from the first chapter, where Raskolnikov is introduced as a figure absorbed in selfish isolation.  Completely absorbed with the self and away from love of God and man, as he contemplates murdering the old woman pawn-broker Alyona Ivanovna his wretched condition is a convincing portrait of the depravity of the human heart estranged from God. As Raskolnikov later confesses: \\"Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that.  It may explain a great deal.\\" (p383).  With a window into the mind of a murderer, we begin to understand him to the point where we identify with him, and realize that we are all capable of enormous sin.  Raskolnikov's loathsome heart is ultimately no different from our own.<br />But Dostoevsky also excels in showing the tragic consequences of depravity: it results in isolation from other human beings, and ultimately from God.  Raskolnikov's deteriorating mental and physical state is highly reminiscent of what David says in Psalm 32 about being in bed, wracked with unconfessed guilt.  Although Dostoevsky shows the effect of sin more in relation to other humans (isolation) than in relation to God, he succeeds in showing the tragic consequences of the darkness of the human soul. Raskolnikov experiences an increasing sense of isolation. \\"It seemed to him, he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\\" (p109)  Such comments about the psychology of a murderer are particularly illuminating.<br />Yet there is also a sense of hope, as Raskolnikov finds the answer to guilt and its consequences in heartfelt repentance.  This solution is enhanced by way of a contrast with the remedy sought by Svidrigailov.  Although his guilt is never directly affirmed, we are left with the distinct impression that Svidrigailov struggles with the same guilt over murder as Raskolnikov.  Svidrigailov advises Raskolnikov that he has only two options: Siberia or a bullet in the head.  But while Svidrigailov himself chooses the latter option of suicide, Raskolnikov chooses Siberia ... and repentance.  This inner transformation leads to significant observable changes inhis life, with Sonia functioning as a Christ figure.  The novel ends fittingly with both realism and optimism about repentance: \\"He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering.  But that is the beginning of a new story - the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.\\" (p505)<br />As a novel, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is not entirely without weaknesses.  The occasional blasphemy eg \\"Good God!\\" was surprising.  The sentences are sometimes broken, and the flow of the English translation is at times unnatural and difficult to read.  Dostoevsky's dialogue is frequently verbose, the lengthy soliloquys unrealistic and tiring.  The Russian names are also difficult to keep track of, particularly because characters are at times referred to using different names (to keep your Petrovna's and Petrovitch's apart, consider keeping a character list handy while reading). But these difficulties are in part a result of the inevitable distance that arises from cultural and language differences.  In the final analysis this book is not easy to read merely because of its weaknesses but because of its brilliance.

US	51067904	R1LQYLPP8MRMI5	1853262412	982792888	100 Selected Stories (Wordsworth Classics)	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Short story master!	A collection of 100 or more short stories by O. Henry?  My mouth waters already!  It's hard to imagine any literary treat that can be enjoyed in small doses more pleasurable than this.  I have spent over a year savouring these stories, reading them one by one, tasting his delightful choice of words, digesting his fascinating story-lines, and the warm satisfying afterglow that comes after a typical twist at the end. His stories are superbly outstanding in at least four ways, each illustrated with five of my personal favorites.<br />Firstly, his brilliant use of language.  These stories were written in the first half of the twentieth century, and O. Henry's use of language easily surpasses that of most contemporary writers.  Not only does he have an extensive vocabulary, but his writing abounds with similes and metaphors that breathe sparkling life and depth into his stories.  \\"Ulysses and the Dogman\\" is a fine example of his skills with a language, metaphorically portraying dog owners as victims of Circe, in a hopeless enchantment to their leashed pets.  Also exemplary is \\"Madame Bo-Peep of the Ranches\\" where a ranch manager has a heart fenced by barbwire just like the ranch on which he lives, and yet the twist at the ending suggests that perhaps we were completely mistaken.  \\"A Comedy in Rubber\\" uses wonderfully elevated language to farcically portray a class of people today known as ambulance chasers.  And \\"Sisters of the Golden Circle\\" revolves around the profound bond that exists between two married women who are strangers but yet sisters \\"of the plain gold band.\\"  \\"An Unfinished Story\\" employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor Dulcie's struggle for survival.<br />Secondly, his unique insight into the social conditions of his time.  O. Henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class, frequently picturing the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century America with sympathetic colours.  His characters are frequently the overlooked: the struggling shop girl, the unsuccessful artist, the impoverished.  Admittedly, some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers, and the distance that time has placed between us and O. Henry's beloved New York means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to identify with. But his genuine sympathy for the oppressed cannot be missed. \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" is the signature O. Henry story, probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other's prized possession that they have just given up.  Another story which displays his ability to picture the social conditions of his time is \\"The Pendulum\\", a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man, until the bubble bursts.  \\"The Cop and the Anthem\\" was the first O. Henry story I ever read, and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter.  \\"The Furnished Room\\" is a tragic and shocking story of suicide, depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished.<br />Thirdly, his warm humour.  O. Henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language.  Frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other.  On other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others.  One of his most popular stories is \\"The Handbook of Hymen\\", the tale of two men in a winter cabin, one armed with the hilarious Herkimer's handbook of Indispensable Information.  And then there's Jeff Peters, a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes, two shining examples displayed in \\"Jeff Peters as a Personal Magnet\\" and \\"The Exact Science of Matrimony\\".  \\"Let Me Feel Your Pulse\\" pokes fun at doctors, whilein \\"Next to Reading Matter\\" an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane.<br />Fourthly, his ironic twist.  One of the distinctive characteristics of O. Henry's short stories is the ironic twist at the end, which never fails to surprise and entertain, sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner. O. Henry's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed.  Like the Jeff Peters stories, \\"The Love-philtre of Ikey Schoenstein\\" also feature a brilliant scheme, and the way the romantic scheme backfires is unforgettable.  Other delightful examples of the glorious ironic twist include \\"Witches' Loaves\\" and  \\"While the Auto Waits\\".  The twist that comes at the end of \\"The Hypotheses of Failure\\" is so perplexing, that you'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which O. Henry has misled you.  Perhaps one of O. Henry's best uses of the ironic twist comes in \\"The Last Leaf\\", a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside, and through the self-less sacrifice of another.<br />The Wordsworth collection is superlative, because it contains more than 700 pages of literary gems.  It consists of 100 stories, showcasing a wide range of O. Henry's short-story talents.  A few popular favorites are missing, such as \\"Schools and Schools\\", \\"Shearing the Wolf\\", \\"The Green Door\\", and \\"The Pimienta Pancakes.\\"  But the reality is that nearly all O. Henry's stories feature his trademark ironic twist, as they do his warm humour, his unique insight into the social conditions of the time, and his brilliant use of language, and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion.  The inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring!  Don't pass up on these!in \\"Next to Reading Matter\\" an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane.<br />Fourthly, his ironic twist.

US	51067904	RDQVZKAIZ1EJO	0745940323	517124112	The Dragon King Saga	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Lawhead "Lite" - not deep, but enjoyable	If you are expecting something like Lawhead's profound and satisfying \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" when reading the \\"Dragon King\\" trilogy, prepare to be disappointed. This is the Lawhead \\"Lite\\" version, because it lacks the depth of description, character and emotion present in many of Lawhead's other works. Undoubtedly, this is more entertainment than the literary fiction of those offerings. But it would be unfair to criticize Lawhead too harshly for this, because this series was born in the infancy of his career as a writer. Readers familiar with the more polished and developed Lawhead as evident in his later work would do the man an injustice by measuring his first work by the incredibly high standard of his more mature efforts. As a series geared towards the level of teens rather than adults, and where the reader is not under the false expectation that it contains the majesty and depth of the \\"Pendragon Cycle\\", this is still a great read.<br />This first volume in the series! \\"In the Hall of the Dragon King\\" introduces us to young Quentin, who undertakes an important mission to rescue the Dragon King Eskevar from the traitorous Prince Jaspin and the evil necromancer Nimrood. The king can be rescued from the corrupt wizard only after Quentin and his friends make a perilous journey to the dreaded Karsh, the desolate home of Nimrood. In volume two of the series \\"The Warlords of Nin\\" Quentin has matured into a young adult, and must defend the royal castle and the kingdom over against the deadly Nin the Destroyer, with his four warlords, and thousands of soldiers. Victory is only possible when Quentin is armed with the enchanted sword Zhaligheer, but first Quentin must make a dangerous journey to search for a rare and fabled substance needed to make the sword. In \\"The Sword and the Flame\\", the third title in the series, the adult Quentin has assumed the throne and is busy building a temple dedicated to the Most High. But the evil necromancer Nimrood re!turns and collaborates with the defenders of the old gods against Quentin. The flame of the sword goes out, and the faith of the king and the hopes of the kingdom appear to be extinguished with it.<br />The strength of the series is the constant battle between good and evil, the powers of light and darkness. Quentin and his companions fight for freedom, justice and righteousness. Lawhead plainly intends this conflict to portray spiritual warfare. Quentin's enemies find their support in the pagan religions who worship the old gods, and employ the powers of sorcery, the occult and the dark arts. In contrast, victory of Quentin's kingdom is possible only with the help of the Most High God. The Christian symbolism is clearly evident: the conflict between the powers of good and evil is a picture of the great spiritual battle of the ages between God and Satan. Readers familiar with the battle images of Ephesians 6 will find the connections obvious. Quentin in particular plays a M!essianic role, by achieving deliverance as the Priest King, fulfilling prophecy in a manner much like Jesus Christ. Yet in contrast to these Messianic overtones of Quentin's role in an epic struggle, Lawhead also humanizes Quentin to the point where he is like us, a soldier in the battle rather than the Deliverer. Lawhead makes profound observations about personal faith, by showing that in the battle Quentin must learn to trust in the Most High. The Most High will be faithful in preserving the Kingdom, but his soldiers must be faithful in trusting and obeying him.<br />It is this depth of spiritual vision that makes Lawhead's prose all the more compelling and enjoyable. It is in the first place a story filled with medieval vistas and conflict - courageous knights in shining armour, flashing swords, evil wizards, deadly battles, heroic quests, and ancient chivalry. But especially the central place of the Most High God makes Lawhead's \\"Dragon King\\" trilogy so powerful and who!lesome - a picture of spiritual warfare, kingsand kingdoms, prophets, dreams and visions, and above all faith in the Most High. It's not as deep and profound as his \\"Pendragon Cycle\\", but Lawhead \\"Lite\\" is still a very enjoyable read.and kingdoms, prophets, dreams and visions, and above all faith in the Most High.

Lawhead continues his stunning \\"Song of Albion\\" series with this sequel to \\"The Paradise War\\".  Once again this effort bears all the hallmarks of good literature - articulate language, imaginative worlds, mystery and suspense, fairy-tale magic, noble kings and princesses, and enduring themes of justice, sovereignty, truth and right.  Lawhead creates a fantastic atmosphere similar to the 1001 Arabian Nights, but on a grander and more glorious scale.  While fantastic fiction, the passions of sorrow and joy Lawhead arouses with his story are very real.  Lawhead has the ability to draw a reader to heights of joy and exuberance, and dash them to the depths of tragedy and tears.  Few writers can make readers cry with joy and with sorrow, but Lawhead is certainly one in this class.  There are depths of sorrow that make you weep, and heights of glory that make you cry out!  The moment when Llew's hand is cut off, and Tegid is blinded stands out as a striking example of literary fiction with the power to create passion.<br />While the first book in the series was narrated by Llew, this novel sees a disturbing shift in perspective as the bard Tegid assumes the role of narrator.  This inexplicable shift takes some getting used to, as we have identified with Llew and grown to love him and see the other world through his eyes, but in the end it doesn't detract from the story.  Unlike the story of the first book, in \\"The Silver Hand\\" the modern world doesn't really enter the picture, and all the focus is on events in the other world of Albion.  After the cruel murder of Meldryn Mawr, Llew (student Lewis Gillies in the real world) is chosen by the bard Tegid Tathal as the new king.  But Llew's kingship is challenged by Meldryn's son Meldron, who is allied with the king's former champion Paladyr and Llew's former friend Siawn (Simon in the real world).  After Meldron slaughters Albion's bards, all of Albion is threatened by his rebellion, enslaved by his depraved desire for dominion, and plunged into civil war.  Left for dead by Melron, Llew and Tegid regroup and build Dinas Dwr, a city on a lake, to where the faithful remnant of Albion come and pledge their allegiance.  But that's just the beginning.  Will Llew prevail and will the true kingdom be restored over against the evil that threatens it?<br />Again Lawhead draws on much Biblical imagery, as the following allusions illustrate: The Psalms: \\"The Goodly-Wise heard our song and reached down with his Swift Sure Hand and plucked us out of the sea - and out of the grave Meldron intended.\\" (p93); God's providence: \\"there surged within me a sudden conviction that we had been led to this place; the Goodly-Wise had directed our steps.\\" (p100); The sabbath rest: \\"In my world, people are granted a day of rest from their labours - one day in every seven.  In past times it was a jealously guarded gift, though now it is no longer recognized as such.\\" (p192); The three meeting of the three Old Testament strands of prophet, priest and king in a Messiah figure: \\"Prydain, Meldryn Mawr, Ollathir, in these three did the essence of Albion reside.  And now these three strands met in one person: Llew\\" (p344); Dependence on God: \\"I raised my staff as they passed and called upon the Swift Sure Hand to uphold them through the fight; I invoked the Goodly-Wise to guide their steps; I entreated the Gifting Giver to grant them the victory.\\" (p351)  All in all, it's classic Lawhead, a thoroughly worthy sequel as the magnificent Song of Albion continues!

Davis Bunn I'd read previous to this effort both revolved around Christmas sentimentalism, and were somewhat trite and disappointing.  Not so with \\"The Great Divide\\".  As a reader who has thoroughly enjoyed practically all of John Grisham's books for their legal drama, thriller suspense, and clean content, I was delighted to find that this effort by Bunn practically matched Grisham on all counts!  Not only that, Bunn is extremely talented in his use of the English language, with delightfully descriptive language, metaphors and similes, and vivid characterization.  In almost all regards it is quite different from his earlier works.  Bunn's other efforts were more distinctly Christian in character and theme, and although this novel is not specifically Christian (aside from the involvement of a church community as part of the story line) it is far more suspenseful and successful.<br />The story-line features Marcus Glenwood, an attorney who is recovering after a terrible car accident which claimed the lives of his two young children and destroyed his marriage.  When asked to uncover the mystery behind the disappearance of Gloria Hall, Marcus is initially reluctant.  But as he discovers the truth behind the claims of Gloria's parents that she was abducted in a Chinese factory run by the American sports clothing manufacturer New Horizons, he agrees to undertake legal action against the manufacturing giant on their behalf.  With one of Gloria's friends, Kirsten, as his ally, and with several of his former colleagues as his nemesis, the suspenseful court-room drama slowly builds up momentum, with several attacks on Marcus' life outside the courtroom adding a chilling spice to an already chilling tale.  Slowly, Marcus uncovers the horrible web behind New Horizons, and the truth behind the disappearance of Gloria Hall.  The only thing that remains a mystery to me in the end is the significance of the title!<br />The bittersweet ending is somewhat satisfying, but is dampened by the startling thought that this could be a true story, a story where the endings are not happy.  One cannot help get the feeling that Bunn is using this novel to unmask human rights abuses in Chinese sweatshops, and expose the support of these abuses by giant manufacturers of sporting clothing who bow to the almighty dollar.  It does not take much imagination to substitute the name \\"New Horizons\\" for the name of a contemporary manufacturing giant of sporting clothing, and raise questions about their practices and ethics.  One of Bunn's final acknowledgements is very telling, where he acknowledges the help of his wife, an international attorney, whose \\"first thesis was on the issue of human rights violations within the Chinese lao gai prison network.\\"  While thoroughly enjoying this book as a work of fiction, I could not help but get the cold feeling that behind the fiction was a great deal of fact.

Orson Scott Card has gained a legacy as a brilliant science fiction writer, and this collection of eleven short stories from early in his career shows the promise that would later bloom in his successful novels.  The final remark of his editor Ben Bova in the introduction is strangely prophetic: \\"...good as these stories in this volume are, I expect you to do better in the future.  And I know you will.\\" Card's later successful novels such as \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" have more than shown this assessment to be true. This collection runs hot and cold, and isn't always as great as Card can be.  But already in this collection you will find examples of Card's brilliance, and that's more than enough to make it worth grabbing and reading.<br />The most outstanding stories in my mind are \\"Mortal Gods\\", \\"Unaccompanied Sonata\\" and of course \\"Enders Game\\". Card later fleshed out \\"Ender's Game\\"into the fully-fledged novel of the same name which garnered awards and for which he is most famously known. But the premise and excitement of the novel are already contained in this brilliant short story about Ender Wiggins, a young boy trained to be a military commander in a battle that will save the human race. His training consists of exciting war games in a null-gravity battleroom, and the enthralling action of these war games and their final plot twist is more than matched by Card's superb human characterization of a child genius.  \\"Mortal Gods\\" introduces aliens who are the \\"natural end product of evolution\\" and have achieved immortality, and come to worship humans because they're mortal.  Card uses this device to offer some profoundly religious and philosophical observations about how our world revolves around mortality and death: \\"we have found a race that builds for the sheer joy of building, that creates beauty, that writes books, that invents the lives of never-known people to delight others who know they are being lied to, a race that devises immortal gods to worship and celebrates its own mortality with immense pomp and glory.  Death is the foundation of all that is great about humanity...\\" (p165-6).  \\"Unaccompanied Sonata\\" is the sad story of the repression of creativity in a control-obsessed society, and the heart-wrenching pain of a Maker who can produce brilliant music but is forbidden to do so.<br />The other stories are good but not brilliant.  The themes of \\"Unaccompanied Sonata\\" are somewhat evident in \\"The Monkeys Thought `Twas All in Fun\\", which describes a living artificial environment in space that becomes a new paradise for residents of earth.  The most interesting part of this tale is the internal stories about Masses, Makers and Masters that \\"Hector\\" tells himselves. \\"Deep Breathing Exercises\\" features suspense revolving around a man who discovers that people breathing simultaneously is a sign of their impending death.  Other stories show that Card has the capability of producing twisted tales with cruel themes.  \\"Closing the TimeLid\\" showcases an interesting premise as people use time travel to undergo multiple deaths for pleasure, and illustrates the depth of depravity as hedonism goes wild.  \\"Kingsmeat\\" is a morbid story about a society with a cannibalistic king and queen, and highlights the character of their chosen instrument of destruction, the Shepherd.  \\"Quietus\\" is a rather perplexing story with a bizarre twist at the end and concerns a family that discovers a coffin (dead body included) in their home.  \\"Epimedes in the Fourth Floor Lavatory\\" is a nightmarish horror story about a selfish manipulator who gets his just deserts as a child with flipper arms torments him.  These and other stories have adult themes about sexuality and abuse that make them unsuitable for children.  But Card's ability to produce profoundly philosophical and religious stories of horror and suspense on an adult level, are matched by his ability to produce a surprisingly child-like sci-fi story in the mould of a traditionalfairy tale, as the \\"The Porcelain Salamander\\" proves.  The protagonist is a girl cursed from birth until she loses the magical salamander she loves most dearly.<br />Probably the least likeable story in the collection is \\"I Put My Blue Genes On\\", which is humorous and light but also confusing.  Recounting a visit of space travellers to earth in 2810 who discover what evolution has done to the human race after recombinant DNA, it is one of the few stories that approaches traditional science fiction.  But on the whole Card's stories are not typical science fiction because they focus on human characterization.  As Ben Bova astutely observes in the introduction, the majority of readers take the label of science fiction to mean \\"incomprehensible gibberish\\" and much hardcore sci-fi is \\"about stainless-steel heroes who conquer the world in phallus-shaped spaceships\\" without depth of characterization.  But Card is different: \\"a powerful writer whose work can be understood and enjoyed by *any* reader.  Your stories deal with people, living, breathing, bleeding people who love and fear and hate and laugh.  Readers can weep for your characters, rejoice with them, thrill over them.  This means that you have already gone far beyond the usual fare of science fiction.  You are a writer for all the people, not merely the narrow spectrum of readers who want nothing more than hard-core science fiction.\\" (p17-18) Ben Bova couldn't have said it better.  I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but have much appreciation for Orson Scott Card.  Card uses the trappings of science fiction to offer a fresh perspective on our own world and the humans who live in it, and so escape the imprisonment of our own worldview.  In Bova's words: \\"More than any writer in sight today, Scott, you exemplify what is best in science fiction: bold imagination blended with realistic human characterizations.  Humanism plus technology.  Brains and heart.\\" (p19) These stories may not be Card's best, but they certainly rank among science fiction's best.fairy tale, as the \\"The Porcelain Salamander\\" proves.

Lawhead's five-volume \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" series was magnificent, and the hope of another series as good seemed an unlikely dream.  But in his three-volume \\"Song of Albion\\" series, Lawhead has more than matched the brilliance of his former effort.  The series kicks off in \\"The Paradise War\\", introducing Lewis and Simon, two university students in Oxford, England.  They are opposites in every way: while Simon is a rich, good looking and lazy Brit, Lewis is a poor, plain and hardworking American, and these opposites prove to play a key role in the events that transpire.  Through a remarkable chain of events, Lewis and Simon both enter a Celtic paradise, the \\"other world\\" of Albion.  Here they become warriors in a society with medieval traditions, ruled by kings and bards.  There are similarities to the worlds of Narnia, and Lawhead paints the other world using language that has strong overtones of Plato's forms.<br />But even more important than the Platonic overtones are the Biblical overtones.  Lewis and Simon's involvement in the other world have Messianic and Satanic allusions respectively.  The title \\"The Paradise War\\" is already an immediate indication that Lawhead is working with the Biblical themes of Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Consummation.  Simon's entrance to Albion in the end proves to be a dangerous and destructive poison in a paradise: \\"Simon, who had forced his way into this world, had brought with him alien and deadly ideas\\" (p407).  As great the good and beauty of this world is, so great is the evil and danger into which it is plunged.  After receiving warrior training, Lewis plays a key role in rescuing Albion from the evil that threatens it.  The main threat is the Cythraul and the infernal demonic host of Lord Nudd's warband, but before they can be conquered the Song of Albion must be restored with its magical singing stones. Lewis (called Llew in the other world) who performs the Hero Feat and so enables king Meldryn to conquer the enemy that threatens and defend the kingship.  In his usual style, Lawhead doesn't go for complex allegory, but incorporates Biblical allusions.  Readers familiar with Scripture will find many of them, such one instance alluding to Aaron and Hur holding Moses' staff aloft.  Some readers might be critical of the fact that Lawhead uses Celtic religion rather than Biblical religion, since although the other world is ruled by the Swift Sure Hand, the Celtic lore at time approaches a pantheon with a plurality and hierarchy of gods, and forms of worship based on rituals and priestly figures much like Old Testament times.  But it could be argued that under the guise of Celtic lore and materialistic religion, Lawhead is portraying and conveying valid truths about Christianity that apply in our world today.<br />As always, Lawhead is tremendously articulate.  Simon's wordy assessment of modern England is a wonderful example showcasing Lawhead's eloquence and humour (p14ff).  The following metaphor is also typical of his talents at literary prose: \\"We might have exhausted our meal grain, but we possessed the bread of dissent in perpetual supply.  When the last of the grain went, people reached for those ready loaves.\\" (p330).  When such eloquence is combined with a vivid imaginative world and deeper themes of kingship, justice, truth and good, the result is a tremendously powerful story.  It is enjoyable for any serious reader, but will especially be enjoyed by Christians who love fantasy in the style of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.  To rank Lawhead on the same level as these two famous writers is perhaps too much, but readers of \\"The Paradise War\\" are sure to wish that they had heard of Lawhead sooner!hreatens and defend the kingship.

If literature is music, then Lawhead's \\"Song of Albion\\" trilogy is a profound symphony, with a tremendously passionate ending. In the final book of the series, \\"The Endless Knot\\" (which sees the welcome return of Llew as the narrator), both the High King Llew and his ally King Cynan find themselves wives: Llew the beautiful Goewyn, and Cynan the mysterious Tangwen. Without becoming sappy or secular in his depiction, Lawhead shows the beauty of pure and passionate love between husband and wife. But Llew's joy is quickly dashed as the two queens are abducted and carried off to distant lands. Accompanied by their warband and the bard Tegid, Llew and Cynan set off in pursuit. The quest through hostile lands and far-off places turns into a Tolkienesque journey, as the land itself becomes the essence of evil, with putrid smells and hidden enemies. As they venture into the heart of evil through the Foul Land (Tir Aflan), our heroes must battle a hostile landscape and its corrupt creatures which have been awakened by evil, such as the dreaded Wyrm which has been awakened by evil.  When they finally discover the source of the evil that has stolen their brides and threatened Albion, the shock is greater than ever, because it ushers in a final battle is against the intruder Simon (Siawn).<br />The conflict reaches an apocalyptic climax in the closing pages, as Llew and Simon meet face to face. The cruel bondage of many that Llew seeks to liberate is a clear portrayal of the horrific slavery to Satan. Meanwhile in Llew, Lawhead paints a portrait of the work of Christ as Messianic king, who \\"becomes justice for his people\\" who in turn can \\"shelter beneath his protection\\" (p82). Like Christ, Llew sacrifices his own life to rescue his bride.  And just as the Bride of Christ will be completely redeemed on the day of His return, so Llew's arrival culminates in a grand conflagration that purifies the world of evil and transforms it to perfection. \\"Out of the molten heat, I saw the foul land of Tir Aflan recast, reshaped, and in fire reborn.  Nothing escaped the refining fire of his irresistible will: all imperfection, all ugliness, all weakness and deformity, all frailty, infirmity, disease, deficiency and defect, every fault and failing, every blight and every blemish, every flaw effaced, purged, and purified...When the fire at last subsided, Tir Aflan had been consumed and its elements transmuted in a finer, more noble conception: recreated with a grandeur as far surpassing its former degradation as if an old garment had been [taken] away and not merely restored, but replaced with a raiment of unrivalled splendor.\\" (p394). Lawhead's extensive description of this cosmic transformation is moving, and all the more moving because of its deep spiritual significance for Christians.<br />Llew's dazed shock at returning to the real world in the end mirrors the reader's emptiness after a passionate and profound journey to the other world. \\"How could anyone ever understand even the smallest, most minute part of all I had experienced?  I had been a king in Albion! I had fought battles and slain enemies, and had, in turn, been killed. Only, instead of going on to another world, I had been returned to the one I had left. Nothing had changed. It was as if nothing had happened at all. All I had done, all I had experienced meant nothing.\\" (p411)  Yet Llew also returns with a new understanding of is present world. After witnessing the reminder of Christ's sacrifice at the celebration of the Lord's Supper in a local church, he realizes the profound significance of his own experiences for the present. \\"This is my body, broken for you ... Ancient words, words from beyond the creation of the world.  Words to explain all that had happened to me. Like a star exploding in the frigid void of space,understanding detonated in my brain. I knew, knew, what it meant...Albion had been transformed - and this world was no longer the same either. Though not as obviously manifest, the great change had already taken place. And I would find it hidden in a million places: subtle as yeast, working away quietly, unseen and unknown, yet gently, powerfully, altering everything radically. I knew, as I knew the meaning of the Eucharistic words of Holy Kingship, that the rebirth of Albion and the renewal of this world were one. The Hero Feat had been performed.\\" (p413). Llew has a deeper understanding of the growing kingdom of Christ as a result of his heroic and sacrificial death that redeemed his bride, the Church. It is this understanding that makes a journey to Albion more than worthwhile. The return to the real world is dazing, but one returns with a renewed excitement about Christ's kingdom.<br />In the end, the Song of Albion is like a literary symphony, with powerful profoundness and passion that captures your heart and sweeps you off your feet, and a magnificent finale that leaves you astounded as the echoes of the last note fade away.  Like any great symphony, \\"The Endless Knot\\" is literary music that unravels your emotions.  By ending this tremendous series with such a brilliant and emotional conclusion, the \\"Song of Albion\\" has more than matched Lawhead's \\"Pendragon Cycle\\", and given it a place among the greatest in contemporary Christian fantasy.

US	51067904	RRZV6DVBLKVO	0310200156	298747465	Evidence of Mercy	Books	5	21	23	N	N	Move over Mary Higgins Clark!	A Christian version of suspense queen Mary Higgins Clark?  Terri Blackstock's skill at writing suspense fiction reminded me much of the mystery queen.  \\"Evidence of Mercy\\" (available as a separate novel, or as one of four best-selling Blackstock novels in the \\"Suncoast Chronicles\\" anthology) is a humdinger of a suspense story, revolving around the lives of three main characters.  The main protagonist, Lynda, is a Christian lawyer whose life is threatened by an unknown killer.  The second central character is the atheist Jake, who becomes a paraplegic after crashing on Lynda's sabotaged plane while test-flying it as a prospective buyer.  The third main character is one of Lynda's clients, Paige, a single parent trying to avoid her abusive ex-husband.  Suspense mounts as the mystery killer and his motive remain unidentified in the first half of the story.<br />It's a terrific and captivating story that draws you in, and at the same time gives you much to think about, because the characters not only battle a mysterious killer, but also their own personalities and weaknesses.  Much Christian fiction falls into the trap of featuring an artificial conversion story.  Terri Blackstock shows that writers can craft a mouth-watering Christian story without artificially sprinkling it with an obvious theological twist of this kind, and yet retain a deeper spiritual significance.  In the afterword, Blackstock explains that the idea of her book came after a personal struggle with her faith, and the growing awareness that faith needs to be put into action.  \\"I thought I believed, I said I believed - but I did nothing to put the belief into action.  I was neither hot nor cold, but luke-warm, and absolutely fruitless.\\"  The title \\"Evidence of Mercy\\" describes this important spiritual theme that Blackstock wants to convey.  The struggles of the three characters mirror Blackstock's own struggles, as she explains: \\"the characters interested me because their own spiritual battles were so much like my own: Lynda, a lukewarm Christian who would let someone die without witnessing to him; Jake, an agnostic who couldn't give up the pilot's seat in his life until it was taken from him; and Paige, a spiritual infant on the verge of belief, who lacked the faith to make the final plunge.\\"  For instance, Lynda comes to conclude \\"she'd made a god of an airplane, an altar of her job, and an idol of her ego\\" (p.38), and Jake realizes the folly of relying on his good looks: \\"If I'd known I was going to be left with just my character, I'd have worked harder at building some.\\" (p.135)  Without taking on an preaching tone that many Christian writers unwittingly do, Blackstock brings out these important spiritual truths by showing them in the lives of her characters in a convincing and persuasive manner.<br />Terri Blackstock's novels are a welcome addition to the ranks of Christian fiction.  The genre has been dominated especially by the historical romance, much of it inferior to secular fictions on most levels.  With her successful efforts in suspense fiction genre, Terri Blackstock shows that it doesn't have to be that way (aside from an unnecessary kiss in the last pages), and that Christian writers can successfully take on new genres, and do so with style.

US	51067904	RKHEB538FTAJK	0451522540	285668696	41 Stories (Signet Classics)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Some of the most enjoyable short stories ever!	A collection of 41 short stories by O. Henry?  My mouth waters already!  It's hard to imagine any literary treat that can be enjoyed in small doses more pleasurable than this.  I have spent over a year savouring these stories, reading them one by one, tasting his delightful choice of words, digesting his fascinating story-lines, and the warm satisfying afterglow that comes after a typical twist at the end.  O. Henry began writing short stories as a prison inmate, and he quickly fine tuned his skills behind the bars and developed into an excellent storyteller.  Born William Sydney Porter (1862-1910), he produced 270 stories under the pseudonym O. Henry. His stories are superbly outstanding in at least four ways, each illustrated with five of my personal favorites.<br />Firstly, his brilliant use of language.  These stories were written in the first half of the twentieth century, and O. Henry's use of language easily surpasses that of most contemporary writers.  Not only does he have an extensive vocabulary, but his writing abounds with similes and metaphors that breathe sparkling life and depth into his stories, marred only by the occasional \\"Lordy\\".  \\"Ulysses and the Dogman\\" is a fine example of his skills with a language, metaphorically portraying dog owners as victims of Circe, in a hopeless enchantment to their leashed pets.  Also exemplary is \\"Madame Bo-Peep of the Ranches\\" where a ranch manager has a heart fenced by barbwire just like the ranch on which he lives, and yet the twist at the ending suggests that perhaps we were completely mistaken.  \\"A Comedy in Rubber\\" uses wonderfully elevated language to farcically portray a class of people today known as ambulance chasers.  And \\"Sisters of the Golden Circle\\" revolves around the profound bond that exists between two married women who are strangers but yet sisters \\"of the plain gold band.\\"  \\"An Unfinished Story\\" employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor Dulcie's struggle for survival.<br />Secondly, his unique insight into the social conditions of his time.  O. Henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class, and he frequently pictures the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century America with warm and sympathetic colours.  His characters are frequently the overlooked: the struggling shop girl, the unsuccessful artist, the impoverished.  Admittedly, some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers, and the distance that time has placed between us and O. Henry's beloved New York means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to understand and identify with. But his genuine sympathy for the oppressed cannot be missed. \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" is the signature O. Henry story, probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other's prized possession that they have just given up.  Another story which display his ability to picture the social conditions of his time - but always with the trademark twist - is \\"The Pendulum\\", a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man, until the bubble bursts.  \\"The Cop and the Anthem\\" was the first O. Henry story I ever read, and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter - it remains vivid in my mind as a memorable favorite.  \\"The Furnished Room\\" is a tragic and shocking story of suicide, depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished.<br />Thirdly, his warm humour.  O. Henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language.  Frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other.  And on other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others.  One of his most popularstories is \\"The Handbook of Hymen\\", recounting the tale of two men in a winter cabin, one armed with the hilarious Herkimer's handbook of Indispensable Information.  And then there is O. Henry's fictional character Jeff Peters, a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes, two shining examples displayed in \\"Jeff Peters as a Personal Magnet\\" and \\"The Exact Science of Matrimony\\".  \\"Let Me Feel Your Pulse\\" pokes fun at doctors, while in \\"Next to Reading Matter\\" an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane.<br />Fourthly, his ironic twist.  One of the distinctive characteristics of O. Henry's short stories is the ironic twist at the end, which never fails to surprise and entertain, sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner. O. Henry's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed.  Like the Jeff Peters stories, \\"The Love-philtre of Ikey Schoenstein\\" also feature a brilliant scheme - but a scheme of romance - and the way it backfires is unforgettable.  Other delightful examples of ordinary stories with a glorious ironic twist include \\"Witches' Loaves\\" and  \\"While the Auto Waits\\".  The twist that comes at the end of \\"The Hypotheses of Failure\\" is so perplexing, that you'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which O. Henry has misled you.  But perhaps one of O. Henry's best uses of the ironic twist comes in \\"The Last Leaf\\", a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside, and through the self-less sacrifice of another.<br />In a collection of 41 stories, it's unavoidable that a few popular favorites are missing.  But the reality is that nearly all O. Henry's stories feature his trademark ironic twist, as they do his warm humour, his unique insight into the social conditions of the time, and his brilliant use of language, and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion.  The inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring!

US	51067904	R3J90ZHVYFUJAK	006447108X	671298565	The Last Battle	Books	5	15	18	N	N	Book 7 - A guide to the unending glory of Narnia	\\"The Last Battle\\" is the seventh and final entry in C.S. Lewis' beloved and enduring Narnia Chronicles, and certainly is best read after first completing the other six books in the series.  Narnia is faced with an apocalyptic crisis, as a false Aslan sets up rule in Narnia.  The false Aslan is in fact a mere [] (Puzzle) dressed in a Lion's skin, and the real mastermind is the crafty ape who acts as his \\"mouthpiece\\" (Shift).  But the faithful Narnians immediately realize something is not right: why does this Aslan not speak to them directly, why is his rule harsh, and why does he advocate an alliance with the Calormenes, the followers of Tash?  As Eustace and Jill enter Narnia to assist the legitimate Narnian king Tirian in the battle against the false Aslan, the deception is slowly exposed.  First posing as Aslan, the enemies of Narnia then speak about \\"Tashlan\\", and eventually about their true master \\"Tash\\".  \\"There was no nonsense about `Tashlan' now\\" (p.160).  The conflict between the friends and enemies of Narnia reaches a decisive battle, after which the faithful Narnians find themselves in the \\"true\\" Narnia - a home of eternal blessedness.<br />As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions.  \\"The Last Battle\\" obviously represents the final conflicts leading up to the end of the world and the return of Christ, complete with signs predicting his coming. Appropriately it features an antichrist that \\"apes\\" the real Christ with its terrible result - \\"he had never dreamed that one of the results of an ape's setting up a false Aslan would be to stop people believing in the real one.\\" (p.92).  Behind the antichrist is the very real power of the devil: \\"People shouldn't call for demons unless they really mean what they say.\\" (p.104)  \\"The true Tash, whom they called on without knowledge or belief, has now come among us, and will avenge himself.\\" (p.203)  Complete with apocalyptic imagery of the sun going blood red (p.196), there is a final battle which ushers in eternal life, painted by Lewis in vivid colours.  The suggestion of a kind of limited universalism as Aslan accepts the unbeliever Emeth's service to the false god Tash as service rendered to him (p.205) is particularly puzzling, but is a minor weakness.  So too is the perplexion notion that \\"Susan ... is no longer a friend of Narnia\\" (p.169).  The concept of Narnia as the \\"Shadowlands\\" in contrast to the true Narnia is more Platonic than Biblical, but still has some merit.  But there are many memorable insights, such as the reference to Christ's birth: \\"a stable once had something inside it that was bigger than our whole world\\" (p.177).<br />But it is especially the delighful picture of the blessed afterlife that brings the Narnian Chronicles to a fitting and final climax.  As King Tirian observes Jill in the afterlife: \\"It was Jill: but not Jill as he had last seen her, with her face all dirt and tears and an old drill dress half slipping off one shoulder.  Now she looked cool and fresh, as fresh as if she had just come from bathing.\\" (p167)  The blessedness of eternal life is far greater than the best that this world offers: \\"If you had once eaten that fruit, all the nicest things in this world would taste like medicines after it.  But I can't describe it.  You can't find out what it is like unless you can get to that country and taste it for yourself.\\" (p.172)  As the unicorn Jewel says: \\"I have come home at last!  This is my real country!  I belong here.  This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now.\\" (p.213)  Here the Narnian faithful are reunited with the memorable true Narnians from all the preceding Chronicles.  But the center of this beautiful world is Aslan himself: \\"There stood his heart's desire,huge and real, the golden Lion, Aslan himself...\\" (p.183)  The final paragraph marks a fitting and final end to the Narnian Chronicles: \\"And as He spoke He no longer looked to them like a lion; but the things that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that I cannot write them.  And for us this the end of all stories, and we can most truly say that they all live happily ever after.  But for them it was only the beginning of the real story.  All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the coer and the title page: now at last they wre beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on forever: in which every chapter is better than the one before.\\" (p228)  What more can be said?<br />As always, in all the upheavals and conflicts of Narnia, Aslan is the one constant, and it is his vital involvement that enables the children to complete their Narnian quest, just as it is Christ who inspires, comforts, guides, and saves in the real world. Narnia may exist only in Lewis imagination and ours, but these underlying truths about Christ ensure that a journey to Narnia is never without profit for the real world.  Those who believe these very real spiritual truths about Jesus Christ know that like Narnia, the real world will also draw to an end and usher in the age of eternal life for true believers.  \\"All worlds draw to an end, except Aslan's own country\\" (p.111) and those who know Him will indeed live forever.huge and real, the golden Lion, Aslan himself...\\" (p.183)  The final paragraph marks a fitting and final end to the Narnian Chronicles: \\"And as He spoke He no longer looked to them like a lion; but the things that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that I cannot write them.

US	51067904	R1BWTJ2HMI91BE	0842335706	521278562	The Last Sin Eater	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A wonderful metaphor of substitutionary atonement.	Imagine you're ten years old, and at your grandmother's death you discover that her sins get taken away by a human sin-eater. Chosen by lot and an outcast of the community, this sin-eater willingly acts as grandmother's scape-goat by offering to take the debt of her sins and suffering the punishment of hell she deserved.  He appears shortly after her death, and undergoes a ritual that signifies him taking over her sins so that she can appear without sin before God.  Rather than being comforted by this long-standing custom, ten year old Cadi Forbes is disturbed by it: who will take the debt of her sins?  She can expect to find no answers from her parents, because her relationship with them has soured ever since the tragic death of her sister Elen.  Along with her mysterious companion Lilybet and her child-hood friend Fagan, she resolves to find the sin-eater and obtain peace from her sins, and so remove the guilt she feels about her role in Elen's death (p163-4).  But Cadi's quest proves to be impossible, because the old custom of the sin-eater does not usually allow sins to be removed prior to death \\"Why can't the sin eater take my sin away now?\\" (p49).  And what about the man of God in the valley who tells her that the age-old custom is meaningless?  As Cadi discovers answers to these questions and finds peace for her soul, the light of the gospel begins shining in the dark valley.  But Cadi's inner peace triggers the arrival of outer conflicts, and a head-to-head battle with the community patriarch the Kai (Fagan's father), who resists the truth, and through whom Satan launches his counter attack.<br />Set in the Appalachians in the 1850s, this is a reflective and contemplative novel with a temendously powerful message.  Cadi's quest for relief from the burden of sin by means of a sin-eater is brilliantly used by Rivers as a metaphor for the gospel.  Cadi's initial fear of the mysterious man of God mirrors the fear we all need to have about going into God's presence as sinners, and the need for spiritual cleansing: \\"If I could talk him [the sin eater] into taking my sins away now, maybe then I could come back and get close enough to hear what the man of God had come to say and not fear being struck dead in the doing.\\" (p92).  \\"God knew me for the sinner I was.  God would decide what he would do to me.  I knew what I deserved: death and a fiery pit of eternal torture and damnation.\\" (p135).  Cadi's discovery is just as vital for readers as it is for her: the gospel of Jesus Christ: \\"You mean he's just like our sin eater!\\" (p146)  \\"No man can take away your sins, only God.\\" (p146)  Even the human sin eater himself must come to the realization that sin can only be removed with the substitute provided by God: \\"I've been the Judas goat leading our people to slaughter without even knowing that Satan was using me to do it.\\" (p311)  Using the sin eater as a metaphor of Christ's substitutionary work is the heart of the gospel, and the heart of the novel.  This brilliant image is outstanding and is easily the highlight of the novel.<br />The notion of the sin eater gives this novel great depth beyond a mere story-line, and when accompanied by many quotations directly from Scripture, is a real strength.  It is unfortunate that the novel as a whole does not live up to the full potential suggested by the brilliant metaphor at its heart.  The rest of the story is riddled with theological errors which detract from the thoroughly Biblical concept of its main message about substitutionary atonement.  Some controversial aspects of Rivers' theology are very evident, including an implicit endorsement of Arminianism (p161,207,250,323); prayers to Jesus; baptism without a real understanding of the gospel or the involvement of office-bearers (p176,280); and the common evangelical concepts about judging being forbidden (p373), God hating the sin and not the sinner (p287), and forgiveness independent of repentance (p373).  The belief in ongoing revelation is also evident on numerous occasions (p162,238,248ff), and although it is fortunate that in most cases this direct revelation from God comes in the form of direct Scripture quotations, there are instances where Biblical references are arguably interpreted and applied incorrectly (p289).  In keeping with this it is not surprising that the *written* Word plays virtually no role in the course of the story.  More surprising from Rivers is the idea that man's total corruption was a development that did not occur immediately after the fall (p144).  Further, the idea that the cycle of the seasons portrays Christ's death and resurrection (p252 & 286) is rooted in pagan mythology rather than in Scripture!  Rivers even takes this one step further by suggesting that someone can be saved by their belief in God as revealed in the seasons, without ever having heard the gospel of Christ in the written Word (p284-7).  Lilybet's identity is also problematic.  Rivers herself raises this question (p321) but doesn't answer it, and in the end Lilybet's role as a \\"taint\\" or an \\"angel\\" is at best implausible and without a strongly credible Biblical foundation.  And on a non-theological note, one wonders whether Cadi's reflections about faith are at times rather too mature for a ten year old.<br />\\"The Last Sin Eater\\" earned Francine Rivers the 1999 EPCA Gold Medallion in the Fiction category.  Certainly on account of its theme it deserves a high commendation.  When combined with Rivers' delightful characterization and insight into personalities and relationships, it is a story with real potential.  But in the end, the gulf between Rivers' theology and mine on other points detracts from the main theme so that this novel doesn't live up to its potential.lation is also evident on numerous occasions (p162,238,248ff), and although it is fortunate that in most cases this direct revelation from God comes in the form of direct Scripture quotations, there are instances where Biblical references are arguably interpreted and applied incorrectly (p289).

US	51067904	R1HY5S8SCW56Q6	0064471098	184061428	The Silver Chair	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Book 6 - A guide to the unending enchantment of Narnia	\\"The Silver Chair\\" was the fourth book published in the Narnia Chronicles, but chronologically is the second last in the series and is published as such by most modern publishers.  The story revolves around cousin Eustace (a familiar face from \\"Prince Caspian\\") and his classmate Jill Pole.  Eustace and Jill narrowly escape school bullies and find themselves in Narnia.  In Narnia, Aslan himself commissions them on a quest to find Caspian's missing son and heir, prince Rilian, who has been abducted by an evil witch posing as a beautiful woman and a horrible green snake.  They are joined in their quest by Puddleglum, a charming Marsh-wiggle whose extreme pessimism ( \\"he's always expecting the worst and he's always wrong\\" p.93) is matched by his bravery.  Together they escape the perils of giants, and by rescuing Rilian from his enchantment in the Underworld and restoring him to his father, they prevent the Green Lady from by achieving her evil ambitions in becoming Narnia's queen.<br />As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions.  Lewis intended \\"The Silver Chair\\" to portray the ongoing war against the powers of darkness. He emphasizes the truth of Deuteronomy 6 that in this war the signs of God's Word need to be carefully remembered and obeyed: \\"And whatever strange things may happen to you, let nothing turn your minds from following the signs ... it is so important to know them by heart and pay no attention to appearances.  Remember the signs and believe the signs.  Nothing else matters.\\" (p.24-26).  Failing to follow these signs makes the task more difficult, but not impossible.  These failures, however, constitute sin, which is clearly portrayed as the fault of man: \\"We must just own up\\" (p.123) and \\"We've brought the anger of Aslan on us.  That's what comes of not attending to the signs.\\" (p.132)  The only solution is to drink from Christ the living water, for there is no other source of water apart from him \\"There is no other stream\\" (p.20-21).  There are also strong allusions to the doctrine of predestination: \\"You would not have called to me unless I had been calling to you.\\" (p.23)  \\"There *are* no accidents.  Our guide is Aslan; and he was there when the giant King caused the letters to be cut, and he knew already all things that would come of them; including *this*.\\" (p.160)<br />As always, in all the upheavals and conflicts of Narnia, Aslan is the one constant, and it is his vital involvement that enables the children to complete their Narnian quest, just as it is Christ who inspires, comforts, guides, and saves in the real world. Narnia may exist only in Lewis imagination and ours, but these underlying truths about Christ ensure that a journey to Narnia is never without profit for the real world.That's what comes of not attending to the signs.\\" (p.132)  The only solution is to drink from Christ the living water, for there is no other source of water apart from him \\"There is no other stream\\" (p.20-21).

A Study in Scarlet is a good detective story, but certainly not Doyle's greatest.  But it bears the distinction of being the novel which introduced the world to the legendary Sherlock Holmes.  First appearing in 1887, it was not to be the greatest story about Sherlock Holmes, but it was the first.  Doyle first introduces us to John H. Watson, a medical doctor recovering from duty in Afghanistan.  Watson needs a room-mate, and a mutual acquaintance introduces both him and us to Holmes.  So we come to know both Holmes, Watson, and the memorable 221B Baker Street.<br /><br />Watson''s first impressions of Holmes are merely that he is a man enshrouded in mystery and eccentricity, and Watson politely restrains his curiosity by avoiding asking too many intrusive questions, despite the parade of strange individuals that come to their apartment to consult Holmes, and despite his bemusement at Holmes' passion for playing the violin and his egotism.  Watson's perplexation at Holmes' character and profession is slowly unravelled in the second chapter which Doyle appropriately titles 'The Science of Deduction'.  Watson observes that &#34;'his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me 'His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.  Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing ' That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to me to be such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.&#34; '(p11).  Holmes apparently is brilliant at identifying a stain on your trousers, but completely ignorant about the most elementary contemporary political events.<br /><br />Ironically, Watson's inability to deduce Holmes' profession proves that he lacks the very ability that he is seeking to uncover in Holmes: deduction.  For Holmes doesn't just excel in specialized knowledge, but especially in the science of deduction and logic.  By utilizing the skills of observation and analysis Holmes asserts that logic could solve all virtually all problems.  In his words: '&#34;From a drop of water, a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other.  So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it.  Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study, nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it.  Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the inquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems.  Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs.  Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches on where to look and what to look for.  By a mans'' finger-nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boots, by his trouser-knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirtcuffs ' by each of these things a man's calling is plainly revealed.  That all united should fail to enlighten the competent inquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.'&#34; (p14-15).  Watson calls this science of deduction 'ineffable twaddle', but as we know, this is the vintage Holmes we love and the very core of his being.  Not only does he prove it to Watson by remarkably deducing that Watson had served duty in Afghanistan, but by collaring the criminal in a murder case.<br /><br />The story itself consists in two parts: the first part introduces us to Holmes and Watson, and describes the murder of Enoch Drebber and his secretary Joseph Stangerson, and several failed attempts of Scotland Yard detectives to solve it, concluding with Holmes unmasking the real perpetrator, to the complete astonishment of all present.  The second part is a flashback, explaining the background and motives for the murder, as finally Holmes relates the observations and deductions that led him to solving it.  In short, 'the crime was the result of an old-standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part.' (p103)<br /><br />But what is fascinating about 'A Study in Scarlet' is not so much the mystery, but the man: Holmes himself.  Doyle would later learn to eliminate some of the excess baggage present in this story (such as the extended flashback) and focus on Holmes and his deductions.  The characterization of Holmes as an eccentric man driven by logic is wonderfully created for the first time in this novel.  Already here is the foundation of the Sherlock Holmes that would become so successful in all of Doyle's later stories.  A few quotes illustrate how the tone of the deductive Holmes is set: '&#34;In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward.  That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much.&#34;' (p99-100) 'There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.' (p100) &#34;'You see, the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.'&#34; (p102)<br /><br />Here the successful formula is already established: Scotland Yard is baffled, so is his foil the bumbling doctor Watson, and so are we the readers.  Holmes has long solved the mystery before we have even begun identifying red herrings, and it is when he sits by the fire and explains to Watson the process of deduction that we curl up in delight.

The concept of a swashbucking adventure where the heroes escape death at the hands of threatening natives by appealing to an eclipse as evidence of their divine power over the sun and moon is hardly a new one.  But to my knowledge, in \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" Henry Rider Haggard (1856-1925) offers no clone of this legend.  He offers the original idea that spawned the copies.  Haggard's story is such a good one, it's not hard to see why it's been often imitated and reworked with varying degrees of success.  Here's a case where you should read the original and find out where all the cliches came from.<br />The story-line is full of adventure, revolving around the journey of three Englishman accompanied with a native into the heart of Africa.  They are in search of king Solomon's legendary treasure of diamonds, a lost brother, and adventure.  The prospect of buried treasure is an age-old theme that arouses excitement today as it did in Haggard's day, and is combined with Haggard's contemporary fascination with the mysteries of Africa.  Haggard employs Allan Quatermain as his narrator.  Quatermain is far from the bravest of characters, and his sense of fear adds to the tension in times of conflict.  His companions, however, are bolder: the native Umbopa and the Englishmen Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good.<br />The first part of the story is somewhat slow, relating the preparations for their adventure, as they venture into the desert wilderness and face the elements.  But persevere through the desert, because if you can make it through the perils of the dry desert with Quartermain and company, even greater adventures lie on the other side.  The area where Solomon's legendary treasure is hidden is inhabited by a lost civilization of primitive and barbarian natives, ruled by an evil leader who proves to be a usurper.  King Twala and his sorceress are not too quickly persuaded by the marvels of European technology. In the style of typical colonistic arrogance, Haggard ensures that his characters survive by pretending to be gods from the stars, their credentials including the use of guns, Good's false teeth, half shaved face, and white legs (the result of which being that Good has to continue walking around without trousers to preserve his image, offering delightful comic relief!).  In the process important questions about colonization are raised, for many of Haggard's contemporaries viewed Africa as a paradise inhabited by barbarians, whose wealth could freely taken over by the \\"superior\\" European colonists.<br />The identity of the rightful king turns out to be rather surprising, and the adventurers pledge to help him overthrow the usurper Twala.  It is at this point that they call on a lunar eclipse to escape death by the skin of their teeth.  Several battle scenes ensure, with truth and justice prevailing. Even though there seems to be some misplaced colonistic arrogance typical of the time, Haggard shows sympathy for the blacks by having his adventurers establish an indigenous government.  More importantly, he shows the follow of paganism and defends important virtues such as justice and truth.  The cause that the adventurers fight for is to overcome evil and maintain a proper king who defends justice, a king with Messianic overtones, and with virtues worth pursuing in our own lives.  Their zeal for the right cause is unforgettable: \\"Never before had I seen such an absolute devotion to the idea of duty, and such a complete indifference to its bitter fruits.\\" (p198)<br />Only then does the diamond hunt continue, but when the elusive treasure trove is finally discovered, the adventurers find themselves trapped, giving new meaning to the expression \\"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\\" (p258).  The irony of being buried with immense wealth is carefully portrayed: \\"There around us lay treasures enough to pay off a moderate national debt, or to build a fleet of ironclads, and yet we would gladly have bartered them all for the faintest chance of escape ...

Lewis wrote in the Narnia Chronicles, but chronologically it relates events that occur first in the series: the creation of Narnia.  Two children, Digory and Polly, enter a strange world through the help of magic obtained by Digory's Uncle Andrew.  In this world they discover the evil witch Jadice.  But then Digory makes his first mistake: he brings Jadice back to life, and worse, brings her evil presence from a world that is dying (Charn) to a world that is just beginning (Narnia).  But Digory is not without redemptive qualities - he journeys with the winged horse Fledge to a magical garden reminiscent of Paradise, and resists further temptations from Jadice by faithfully taking an apple from a tree in the middle of the garden and planting it in Narnia.  This fruits of this tree eventually prove to be a blessing to Digory and Polly as they return to the real world.  In fact, it is this tree that later will be built into the magic wardrobe of book 2.<br />As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions. \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" very obviously reflects on the motifs of creation and fall, as evil enters a beautiful world where a man and his wife are king and queen (p.142).  The notions of creation, the Paradise garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, the forbidden fruit, and the tempter Satan, are all present.  Especially telling is Aslan's indictment of Digory for bringing evil into the newly created world: \\"You see, friends, that before the new, clean world I gave you is seven hours old, a force of evil has already entered it; waked and brought hither by this son of Adam.\\"  But there is immediately a hint of redemption and the suggestion that it will be accomplished by Aslan himself.  \\"But do not be cast down.  Evil will come of that evil, but it is still a long way off, and I will see to it that the worst falls upon myself ... Adam's race has done the harm, Adam's race shall help to heal it.\\" (p.161-2).  Digory's successful resisting of the temptation of Jadice in obtaining the magical silver apple is a subtle reversal of the account of the fall, and possible only because of Aslan.<br />As always, in all the upheavals and conflicts of Narnia, Aslan is the one constant, and it is his vital involvement that enables the children to complete their Narnian quest, just as it is Christ who inspires, comforts, guides, and saves in the real world. Narnia may exist only in Lewis imagination and ours, but these underlying truths about Christ ensure that a journey to Narnia is never without profit for the real world.t do not be cast down.

But not that this really matters, because perhaps more so than with any of the other Narnia stories, this is an independent story.  Peter and Susan are now High King and Queen of Narnia, but their role is more in the background.  The hero is a young boy Shasta, who discovers that he is not the real son of the Calormene fisherman Arsheesh, and so decides to flee north to Narnia with a talking Narnian horse called Bree.  He meets up with a runaway girl, Aravis, and her talking horse Hwin.  On their way north, the foursome meet with perilous adventures, and in the Calormene capital city Tashbaan, they uncover an evil plot over against Narnia.  After a perilous journey to Narnia, not only do they warn Narnia of the impending attack, but Shastah discovers his real father.  It's a compelling story that many regard as one of the best in the series.<br />As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions.  By means of Shastah's adventures, \\"The Horse and the Boy\\" marvellously shows how by the providence of God, Christ is behind all the events of our life, even hurt and pain, working for good (p.175), as Shastah comes to realize when he says \\"It wasn't luck at all really, it was Him!\\" (p.180).  But the talking horse Bree also has things to learn, and in his case it is pride and self-conceit that must be abandoned.<br />As always, in all the upheavals and conflicts of Narnia, Aslan is the one constant, and it is his vital involvement that enables the children to complete their Narnian quest, just as it is Christ who inspires, comforts, guides, and saves in the real world.

It is not the most exciting in the series, but it's still an enthralling story.  Through Doctor Cornelius, who has true Narnian blood, Prince Caspian discovers that he is the rightful heir to the throne and that his uncle King Miraz is a usurper.  When Miraz fathers his own son, Caspian's life is endangered and he is forced to flee.  Summoned by a magic horn blown in this time of peril, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy re-enter Narnia.  Only with their help and the ever-present guidance of mighty Aslan does Caspian have any hope of saving Narnia from persecution and oppression under Miraz, and restoring it to the kingdom of peace it should be.  The climax involves a thrilling and decisive duel.<br /><br />As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions.  Lewis intended 'Prince Caspian' especially to portray the restoration of true religion after corruption.  But it also portrays spiritual warfare, showing the importance of our sufficiency being in Christ and not in ourselves.  As Aslan says: 'If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would have been a proof that you were not.' (p220)  It further demonstrates the folly of atheism and importance of living by faith and not by sight, since God's invisible nature does not mean he does not exist (p.150).  The notion of Aslan''s perceived increase in size has profound spiritual implications about increasing one's respect and awe of Christ: 'But every year you grow, you will find me bigger.' (p148)  Such important moral lessons about the role of faith in Christ are typical of Lewis' style in the Narnia series...	2002-04-26

Edmund and Lucy are joined by their cousin Eustace on an expedition with King Caspian on the good ship Dawn Treader, in search of Caspian's exiled ancestors.  At their first stop, Lonely Island, they need to overcome the corruption of the local governor Gumpas and restore the Narnian rule.  After weathering a storm, they retreat to Dragon Island for repairs, where the beastly Eustace is shown his true self by being turned into a dragon.  Next is Deathwater Island, which shows the folly of greed as objects are turned to gold.  On the Island of the Voices, the invisible Dufflepuds need to be freed from their enchantment.  The Dark Island (where dreams come true) results in horrifying real nightmares.  And the last Island (called by some \\"World's End\\") brings the adventurers to Aslan's table.  After a multitude of wonderful adventures, the travellers finally arrive at the Very End of the World, where Aslan's own country is.  It's a touching story, and when combined with memorable characters such as the gallant mouse Reepicheep, this has to be a strong contender for the best in the series.<br />As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions.  \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" presents the beastly Eustace as a vivid portrait of a sinner as a helpless dragon that needs Christ to take off the scales of his old nature and dress him in the clothes of a new nature (p.115ff).  Eustace' post-conversion confession that \\"I'm afraid I've been pretty beastly\\" is true in more ways than one.  Aslan's table has eucharistic overtones.  But the highlight of the book and one of the highlights of the series is the metaphorical journey of the Dawn Treader.  By portraying time as a place, Lewis uses the geographical journey to the end of the world as a metaphor for a journey to the end of time, where water is \\"drinkable light\\" (p.248), and where the dawn of the day of Christ's kingdom awaits.  Appropriately in keeping with the Biblical significance of the number seven as a number of fulness, it is after visiting six islands that the Very End of the World is reached.<br />This book also contains the key to the spiritual significance of the whole series: the role of Aslan.  This becomes evident when Aslan says \\"This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there.\\"  About the real world, Aslan observes \\"There I have another name.  You must learn to know me by that name.\\" (p.270).  This is an apparent inconsistency in the Narnia Chronicles, because none of the characters actually seem to know Christ in the real world - Eustace doesn't even know Adam and Eve (\\"The Silver Chair\\" p.40).  Yet it is clear that Lewis wants our understanding of Aslan in the world of Narnia to lead to a growing knowledge of Christ in the real world.<br />Aslan is of course symbolic of Christ: \\"He is the great lion, the son of the Emperor-beyond-the-Sea, who saved me and saved Narnia.\\"(p.118)  As always, in all the upheavals and conflicts of Narnia, Aslan is the one constant, and it is his vital involvement that enables the children to complete their Narnian quest, just as it is Christ who inspires, comforts, guides, and saves in the real world.

Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are busy playing in the huge house of a professor (the grown-up Digory), when they chance upon a wardrobe which turns out to be a doorway into another world: the world of Narnia.  Under the curse of the wicked White Witch, Narnia is experiencing a harsh winter and suffers under her iron rule over the true-hearted creatures of Narnia.  With the help of the delightful Mr. & Mrs. Beaver, the children begin making plans to rescue Narnia.  When Edmund - under the influence of magical Turkish Delight - betrays them to witch, their lives are imperilled.  Only the vital intervention of the great Lion Aslan can rescue the children - and all of Narnia - from the cold curse of the witch.  This he does by means of a terrible sacrifice, and subsequent victory in a decisive battle involving all the creatures of Narnia.<br />As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions.  In \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" there are allusions to Satan's deceptive schemes in promising mankind kingship over the world, as well as to the death and resurrection of Christ as a substitutionary atonement in saving sinners from Satan (p.165ff).  This cannot be regarded as a strict allegory, because otherwise one will be quick to point out its shortcomings (in Scripture it is God's justice, not Satan, that Christ must make a \\"deal\\" with).  But Lewis plainly uses the great lion Aslan as a symbol of Jesus Christ.  Meeting Aslan evokes a sense of awe, fear and delight (p.86), because he is \\"both terrible and good\\" (p.140ff), paralleling the holiness and mercy of the only Saviour Jesus Christ.<br />As always, in all the upheavals and conflicts of Narnia, Aslan is the one constant, and it is his vital involvement that enables the children to complete their Narnian quest, just as it is Christ who inspires, comforts, guides, and saves in the real world.

In recent times the genre of the psychological thriller has gained immense popularity.  But it's a hardly a new art, as anyone familiar with Stevenson's famous Dr. Jekyll and Hyde will be aware.  James Hogg's work does not enjoy the same legendary status as Stevenson's classic, but it is a worthy predecessor of its famous counterpart, anticipating it in many ways.  In short it's very theological and psychological portrait of a man who is misled by the devil, evolving into a supernatural thriller.  Published in 1824, it is widely regarded as the best work of the Scottish poet James Hogg (1770-1834).<br />It's a great script.  The three-fold structure leaves open many questions about the interpretation of the novel, since the first and last part of the novel are supposed objective rational accounts of Wringhim's life by an unnamed editor, and yet the real truth of the murder mystery has to be elicited from Robert Wringhim's own irrational and subjective record of the same events (the middle section of the book).  The structure of the narrative itself lends to the elusiveness of identifying the exact role of Gil-Martin as a doppelganger, an allegorical figure, a multiple personality, or an embodiment of Satan (this last being the most satisfying conclusion in my mind).  In the end, it is still not clear who has really perpetuated the murders, and part of the brilliance of the novel is that it itself eludes a clear answer to the question \\"What happened?\\"<br />But it is not so much a murder mystery as it is a tale of the supernatural, and a deeply religious and psychological portrait of a madman.  Some have regarded it as a satire on Calvinism, although it seems to me that shoe fits antinomianism rather better than Calvinism, because Calvinism maintains that assurance of election comes not through secret revelation, but through the fruits of election, which are a godly life.  It could also be construed as a warning against intellectual arrogance, self-righteousness and hypocritical religious rationalism/fanaticism as embodied in Robert and his father.  Certainly it is a deeply religious study in the deception of the evil one and the depravity of mankind, and chronicles a journey of human destruction.<br />But although one having a theological interest in these matters will gain greater enjoyment of the story, in the end it is just as much a psychological tale as it is a theological one.  The occasional use of Scottish idiom by commoners in dialogue sometimes makes reading difficult, but on the whole this is a story accessible to anyone with an appreciation for a fine literary creation with a theological and psychological twist.  It's a chilling classic that deserves more exposure than it has received.ypocritical religious rationalism/fanaticism as embodied in Robert and his father.

Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe carved a literary niche for the survival story, and The Swiss Family Robinson is one of the many stories carved in that mould. Written from the perspective of the father, it chronicles the first-hand account of the shipwreck and survival of a Swiss family of six on a remote island somewhere near New Guinea.  The family consists of a Swiss pastor who is a walking encyclopedia on agricultural practices from around the world; his wife who excels in equal measure with culinary skills, and four energetic sons.  Displaying remarkable resilience and resourcefulness, they survive completely alone for over ten years until their rescue.  In the process, they create their own European civilization, showing complete mastery over animals and plants, and creatively establishing houses.  The bulk of the novel consists of their struggle for survival with their endless discovery of new species of plants and animals..<br />Readers should be warned that different versions of the Swiss Family Robinson abound.  The Swiss pastor originally credited with the work - Johann David Wyss (1743-1818) - originally told many of these tales to his children, one of whom was likely responsible for the editing and publication of it.  It was subsequently translated into many languages, with translators taking major liberties in abridgement or adding episodes of their own.  The Disney film version, for instance, contains confrontations with pirates that are entirely absent from the original.  Some versions speak of the shipwrecked lass as \\"Jenny\\", others as \\"Emily\\".  The version I read (the Puffin Classics edition) was the translation of WHG Kingston, first published in 1879, and widely regarded as one of the best-loved English translations.  Remarkably, however, it is not based on the original German version, but on an 1816 French version.  Regardless of which version one reads, abridged versions sacrifice much of the charm of the original.  The longer versions are eloquent, descriptive, and employ vocabulary and language that makes them far more satisfying than most contemporary condensed versions.<br />Given that the original author was a Swiss pastor, it's not surprising to find the narrative soaked with implicit Christian influences.  There are frequent references to God's providence, commendation into God's care, keeping the day of rest, as well as the encouragement of Christian morals.  The exercise and promotion of Christian virtue is a clear theme, evident especially in a final scene where the father charges his sons to be faithful as Christians.  \\"In a long conversation with my sons I solemnly charged them with the future responsibilities of their life, in all its varied aspects, of duty towards God, their fellow men, and themselves, pointing out the temptations to which their different characters were likely to expose them, and exhorting them affectionately to hold fast to the faith in which they had been brought up.\\" The boys all have different strengths and weaknesses, and Wyss presents this as a moral lesson for his readers: \\"Children are, on the whole, very much alike everywhere, and you four lads fairly represent multitudes, who are growing up in all directions.  It will make me happy to think that my simple narrative may lead some of these to observe how blessed are the results of patient continuance in well-doing, what benefits arise from the thoughtful application of knowledge and science, and how good and pleasant a thing it is when brethren dwell together in unity, under the eyes of parental love.\\" The importance of a wholesome Christian family working together is very central: \\"And my great wish is that young people who read this record of our lives and adventures, should learn from it how admirably suited is the peaceful, industrious and pious life of a cheerful and united family, to the formation of strong, pure and manly character.\\"<br />The island proves to be a form of idyllic paradise, where animals fromevery continent around the world apparently co-exist in a rather impossible manner (Australian kangaroos and platypuses, Antarctic penguins, African lions and elephants, North American wolves, and bears, South American boa constrictors, not to mention walruses, tapirs, toucans, flamingos and ostriches).  New species of plants and animals are conveniently discovered on a daily basis, and the Wyss family appears to have an inexhaustible knowledge of how to use these resources to create their own civilization.  They are little troubled by sickness, storms or strife, and have few difficulties in taming nearly every animal known to mankind. They are able to cook every delicacy ever conceived.  Whether their menu offers truffles or turtle, roasted bear-paw or buffalo, the food is always good and the meat never burnt.  In fact their success sometimes becomes rather repetitive and tiresome, and is evidently rooted in an overly optimistic view of mankind and faith in the possibilities offered by scientific knowledge.<br />But rather than become too frustrated by the utopianism, you should suspend your sense of disbelief and enjoy the ride.  Certainly it is rather hard to believe that a Swiss pastor can immediately recognize a Myrica cerifera when he sees one and conveniently knows that its berries can be melted and strained to make candles, or that he knows that a sturgeon's bladder can be used to make isinglass, or that he remembers intricate details about Italian, Indian and South American practices of agriculture and animal husbandry.  The production of chinaware, porcelain, soap, and rubber boots and the apparent skills in taxidermy and other exotic abilities may at times be hard to swallow.  And the endless discoveries and conquests of nature are rather repetitive.  But in the end it's enjoyable.  It's little wonder that the Wyss family decided not to leave their \\"New Switzerland\\" at the end.  For the same reason, so many people come back to the Robinson's island time and again.

It is impossible to do justice to this epic tome of over 1000 pages in less than 1000 words.  Ostensibly, Michener presents it as the story of a group of archaeologists excavating the tell of Makor, an Israeli site between Akko and the Sea of Galilee.  The central characters at the dig are representative of the three great religions: Jews, Christians and Moslems.  There is an Irish Catholic (director Dr. John Cullinane), an Arab (archaeologist Jemail Tabari), and two Jews (the pottery expert Dr. Vered Bar-El, and the chief administrator Ilan Eliav).  Several other Jews also figure prominently, including the secretary of the kibbutz (Schwartz), the American millionaire supporting the project (Paul J. Zodman), and an Israeli soldier, diplomat and statesman (General Teddy Reich).  Together this cast of characters uncovers precious remnants that tell the tale of Makors history.  <br />But this is just the beginning.  Starting with the oldest level of history, Michener then weaves a fictional story around each item discovered by the archaeological dig.  There are 15 levels in total, all representatives of key events and phases in the history of Israel.  In turn, Michener paints a picture of each level: Cave, Canaanite, Patriarchal, Davidic, Babylonian, Hellenistic, Herodian, Vespasian, Byzantine, Muslim, Crusader, Mameluke, Kabbalistic, Turkish, Independence, and modern Kibbutz (p1028).  The archaelogical dig is the framework that ties these levels together and gives the entire novel an inherent unity.  But actually each chapter/level is an independent story that can be read on its own, and functions as a microcosm of an era, embodying its spirit and religious conflicts.  Each archaeological fragment represents a fragment or snapshot of history, which Michener uses as a literary device to portray a glimpse into each time period.  <br />This approach naturally has weaknesses  the novel lacks a tight unity,and is in the end a collection of mini-stories with somewhat of an unmistakable scholarly historical tone.  And the historical snapshot only gives a slice of a historical era, and so sacrifices a complete picture of each era.  Moreover, uneducated readers may find it hard to distinguish fiction from fact because the two are woven seamlessly  although the knowledgeable reader will have no difficulty discerning the difference.  Yet the brilliance of Micheners approach is that unlike historians who paint history in broad strokes, Michener zooms in on a fragment with detailed and vibrant strokes, weaving together history and fiction to give us a colourful and convincing idea of what it really might have been like.<br />Not only does Michener provide lasting insights about Israels history, but especially its religion.  Makor, appropriately, is Hebrew for The Source.  Michener uses this brilliantly on two levels  outwardly it signifies the water source crucial to Makors life, but metaphorically it signifies the religious source of the three great religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  The Source is ultimately not just a chronicle of history, but a study of religion, and the source and interaction of these three religions:  We are digging among the foundations of three great religions. (p26)  Michener portrays the constant struggle of the three different faiths, as they deal with synthesis and antithesis.  This makes The Source not just a novel, but a thrilling textbook of history, psychology, sociology, and religion all at once.  It is hardly a light read, and at times you find yourself wading through piles of information.  But thats what gives this novel  unlike most modern offerings  an enduring quality.<br />Unfortunately Micheners mini-stories are not of equal brilliance.  The first quarter of the novel is more tedious and speculative  not surprising because it chronicles a much more ancient history.  Michener is evidently a disciple of critical scholarship - his portrayal of the early beginnings of Judaism is clearly evolutionist and evolutionary (p169,209,251-2), and sacred Scriptures are presented as the product of human development rather than divine revelation (p173).  Those committed to the inspiration and infallibility of the Bible will find much speculation and inaccuracies to criticize in the first few chapters.  But as the novel progresses these weaknesses are no longer evident, and the second half of the novel more than makes up for this.  One of the highlights is the chapter entitled The Law which gives real insight into the intentions and practices of Judaism as it developed after the arrival of Christianity.  The climax describing the war for the Independence of Israel after the Second World War rivals a thriller novel.<br />First published in 1965, it would be unfair to criticize The Source for not touching on the most recent forty years of Jewish history.  As it stands, it is a remarkable achievement that gives an incredible insight into the deep roots of Israel and of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  If you want to know the source of Israels political and religious conflicts, come to a deeper understanding of our modern world, and have a great read at the same time, go to The Source.

This novel is one of two by Ellis Peters about the medieval detective Cadfael that I've now read. But I'm hooked!<br /><br />In this first volume of the extensive Brother Cadfael series, the medieval crime sleuth is part of a quest of monks pursuing the bones of saint Winifred from Welsh soil, a quest commissioned by the blessed lady herself in an apparent vision to Brother Columbanus.  But the town which houses Winifred's body doesn't want to give up her blessed bones so easily, and the peaceful mission is soon disturbed by the murder of the leader of the town.  Suspects abound, including two suitors to his beautiful daughter, both of whom could benefit from his murder.  Is the arrow in his body really from the daughter's true love, or has the other suitor tried to frame him?  And are all the monks themselves beyond suspicion? Only Cadfael with his humble yet brilliant mind can unravel the truth, and come with a remarkable solution that ties up all the loose ends. The twists of the story-line are so ingenious they rival and perhaps surpass the efforts of most best-selling thrillers today.<br /><br />Peters' command of the English language is outstanding, as is her precise portrait of medieval times. Although the religious aspect forms the fabric on which the novel is painted, the real concern is with characterization and intrigue.  The tale is cloaked in constant talk of the supernatural, but Peters actually offers a novel that is more psychological than religious, and it is by applying the principles of reason rather than religion that Cadfael discovers the truth.  The intriguing element of mystery that makes detective Cadfael's presence essential to the plot clinches this novel as a romping success.<br /><br />If you enjoy mystery, as well as a writer's ability to make excellent use of the English language with colourful descriptions, you are sure to enjoy this book.  And chances are, like me you won't be able to stop after reading volume 1!	2002-04-09

But the \\"Songs in the Night\\" series has a rather different focus: The Nazi Germany of the Second World War.  Much of the background is familiar: the horrible treatment of the Jews, the ruthless oppression of the Nazi Gestapo, the underground efforts of the resistance movement, and the clever charisma of Hitler in drawing a whole nation together against the rest of Europe.  But Cavanaugh offers a fresh approach by presenting an inside look into Nazi Germany.  Unlike most war novels, the heroes of his story are not from Allied countries, but Germans: A German pastor and his young pregnant wife.  Rev Josef Schumacher pastors the church of his father-in-law and mentor, a man who is convinced that Christians can stand fully behind the Nazi movement.  But Josef comes to realize that German Nazism is antithetical to Christianity, and personally is engaged in a fight against its T-4 project (which practiced euthanasia and experimentation on handicapped children).<br />I have often wondered how the German nation as a whole could follow Hitler, and how Christians in Germany had to deal with this.  Few authors give insights into this question, but Cavanaugh more than makes up for it. Cavanaugh accurately portrays the vital role of the Hitler Youth in preparing a nation for war, and Hitler's brilliance in conscripting German youth for his cause.  He shows that many Christians were brainwashed by Hitler's patriotic fervour, and Hitler's careful choice of words in presenting the German cause as blessed by God. At the same time, Cavanaugh shows that while outwardly religious, Nazism presented itself as an alternative to Christianity with Hitler replacing God.  For Christians there were only two alternatives: synthesis, or resistance.  Many Christians, blinded by Hitler's charisma, chose the easy way of synthesis.  Cavanaugh's hero Reverend Josef Schumacher has his eyes opened to the truth the hard way, as he slowly sees through the Nazi rhetoric and misguided patriotism and comprehends the spiritual threat that Nazism really is for the youth of the church. When he realizes that Nazism and Christianity are incompatible, he is forced to stand up for the truth and make very difficult choices even though they imperil his relationships in his family and congregation, and even his own life.  For German Christians, the threat of Nazism was more than just a political one, but a religious test of faith, and the ensuing struggle was ultimately a struggle for their faith, a microcosm of the age-old struggle between Christ's church and the devil.<br />But while Cavanaugh offers a remarkable insight into Nazi Germany and living the Christian faith in testing times, he at the same time offers a most entertaining novel.  The action rarely lets up, with constant surprises, twists and turns of tension.  Even though the suspenseful plot rarely slows down, the characterization does not suffer.  The main characters are pictured with very real emotions of joy and sorrow, and like real people have the ability and capacity to change and grow.  But it is especially the spiritual qualities and insights of this novel that make it so appealing.  I do not know how accurate Cavanaugh's portrait of Christianity in Nazi Germany really is, but his real picture of the struggles of Christians in the epic battle against evil is certainly one encouraging for believers today in their battle against evil.

Frederick Forsyth has written some legendary thrillers, in particular The Day of the Jackal.  In this novel, the jackal is replaced by dogs, and the lone assassin replaced by a team of mercenaries with the mission of taking over a floundering African republic.  The mission is instigated by Sir James Manson, whose driving force is marked by \\"an unscrupulousness ... a preparedness to ignore so-called moral principles in pursuit of the goal succcess.\\" (p.117)  Manson heads the huge mining company Manson Consolidated, and after discovering a mountain with ten billion dollars worth of platinum, in his pursuit for mammon Manson decides to maximize his millions by arranging a coup to take over the African country which holds this buried wealth.  Through his personal aide, he employs mercenary leader Cat Shannon to undertake this mission.<br />Most of the novel revolves around Shannon's preparations for the military coup.  Just as The Day of the Jackal was the anatomy of a hit, the Dogs of War is the anatomy of a coup; it deals with a military coup in the same manner that the former book deals with an assassination attempt.  The concept is certainly interesting -  \\"knocking off a bank or an armored truck is merely crude - knocking off an entire republic has, I feel, a certain style.\\" (p.120)  But unlike The Day of the Jackal, the anatomy of the coup suffers from tediousness at times, and is overly burdened with details of letters and arrangements as Shannon acquires arms, equipment and men. The apparent depth of Forsyth's research is fantastic and certainly adds to the credibility and authenticity and a slow and convincing build-up.  But unless you are personally planning to take over an African republic, you will find many of the details rather unnecessary, The story is also marked by instances of remarkable coincidence, such as Shannon's ease in bedding Manson's daughter.  Although there are implicit references to unchastity, we are spared any vivid details, and the instances of profanity can be counted on one hand.<br />In the end, while it's an interesting novel, it doesn't have nearly the same bite as the Day of the Jackal.  The ending moves quickly and has a nice twist (although the glorification of suicide is disappointing), but it is too little too late.  It's clean and convincing, but the majority of this book is rather too slow moving.  The bark of these Dogs of War is worse than their bite, and anyone looking for more bite is better off re-reading the Day of the Jackal.

Many novels have been written in the espionage genre using the cold war as a backdrop, but Robert Ludlum's \\"The Matarese Circle\\" is one of the best.  It features two elite hit men - a Russian and an American, both regarded as the very best that their countries have produced.  The Russian KGB agent Vasili Talaniekov and the American CIA agent Brandon Scofield have no love for each other because of deep grudges.  But when their own countries put out execution orders for both their own men, the two arch-rivals and enemies are forced go on the run and to band together.  In a remarkable alliance, they slowly uncover a global conspiracy with tentacles in Moscow and Washington.  They expose the roots of this conspiracy in Corsica, where they discover the terrible secret of the Matarese: a Council of chosen ones who have power in the highest levels of government around the world, and who are unfolding their plan of world domination - starting at the very highest level in the USA.  But the Matarese are faceless men, and although their dogged research imperils the lives of all they talk to, and they are constantly challenged by the hidden army of people with the secret blue Matarese circle tattooed on their chest, eventually Talaniekov and Scofield uncover the real threat and objective of the Matarese, as the identity of the Shepherd Boy who leads the Matarese is finally revealed.  But how to expose this terrible truth? - for that Valienkov and Schofield have to take desperate measures, resulting in a thrilling final conclusion.<br />Readers should expect the features that are typical of the espionage genre - there is a significant amount of blasphemy (although not much other foul language), the odd unchaste behaviour (although this is more incidental and very infrequent), and frequent deaths (although this is not described in gory detail, but more as showing the extent to which defenders of global conspiracy will go to protect their cause).  Aside from this, we are treated to typical cold war espionage fare - secret phone calls between Washington and Moscow, false identities, clandestine contacts, double agents and spies, defectors, surveillance, and hitmen and men on the run.  It's not always entirely believable, but who cares, it's terrifically entertaining!  The twists and turns in this novel are never-ending, the excitement breath taking, and you'll find it incredibly difficult to put this book down once you've started.  Ludlum is a master of suspense and intrigue.  Unlike writers like Tom Clancy, it doesn't feature the techno-jargon and detailed research about fancy weapons that give more depth but bog down the plot.  Don't read this book for depth of characters, espionage realism or profound literary insights, but if you want a book with an exciting and entertaining plot laden with heart-stopping tension, this is it.

US	51067904	R34WGNN5XSP4OQ	038550120X	299088859	A Painted House	Books	4	2	2	N	N	So Grisham can write a REAL novel!	A Painted House marks a real departure from Grisham's legal thrillers.  They are hardly formulaic, but they are certainly all in the same genre.  Not A Painted House.  It shows that Grisham has the ability not only to entertain with a fast-paced suspense thriller, but can also craft a real novel.<br />Where his legal thrillers excel in plot, A Painted House excels in characterization.  Grisham employs the first person point of view to have us view the events of 1952 through the eyes of seven year old Luke Chandler.  Luke lives with his parents and grandparents in rural Arkansas on a family farm that depends on the cotton crop for its livelihood.  To assist them in harvesting the cotton, his parents employ a truckload of Mexican migrants and a family of hill-people.  For all of these members of the lower class, eking out an existence is hard work and beset by trials.<br />The novel is a canvas on which Grisham superbly paints the scenery of post-war America through the eyes of a child, presenting events and characters from his naïve perspective.  Luke Chandler's world is a small world, and the biggest parts of it are the cotton picking, the Saturday trip to town, the Sunday worship, and his dreams to play for the Cardinals that his family steadfastly follows on their radio, and the special treats: the carnival.  Apparently inspired by his own childhood, Grisham successfully captures the flavour of rustic Arkansas, portraying events through Luke's eyes, from the excitement of the church picnic baseball to the whispered church gossip and the morning cup of coffee, as well as a complex social structure with memorable characters: his family, the Mexicans, the hill people, the neighbours, and even Luke's absent uncle Ricky who is in Korea in the Crimean War.  In a simple but heart-warming way, Luke is confronted with issues too big and complicated for a young boy to understand: moral dilemmas surrounding a murder, an illegitimate child in the family, child-birth and financial devastation wrought by crop failure and floods.  His innocence and confusion is delightful.  One exception would be Luke Chandler's infatuation with a seventeen year old. Seven year olds are curious, but not that curious, and Luke's eagerness to see a seventeen year old girl naked is more typical of a teenager and perhaps Grisham's readers than a young boy of seven.  The accompanying description of nudity and Luke's frank confession of lusts was in my view unnecessary and unnatural (p99-100).<br />Grisham's portrayal of religion was also surprising.  Not only were there several instances of blasphemy (eg p158,163), but the country Baptist preacher was portrayed as a fire and brimstone Bible thumper whose preaching against moralism was rather ineffective and irrelevant - surprising from Grisham who himself is a Christian.  But perhaps Grisham is just portraying his Christian religion as it might be understood through the eyes of a child: oppressive in one instance, perplexing in another.  In his childlike faith, Luke believes that \\"If the rains washed away our crops, then there was a reason for it...As Baptists we believed God was in control of everything.\\" But he doesn't understand how this theology applies to baseball: \\"I was certain there was a reason the Cardinals lost the pennant, but I couldn't understand why God was behind it.  Why would God allow two teams from New York to play in the World Series?  It completely baffled me.\\" (p251)<br />The plot, in the end, is not significant, aside from the brief excitement of a baseball game, the tension between various characters, and some aspects of mystery and intrigue which are never entirely satisfactorily resolved in an ending with too many loose ends.  What makes this novel are the characters themselves, and the very real world that Grisham places them in.  The atmosphere is entirely authentic and convincing.  The reader has the sense that this is a real world, and that this is really what life was like for many families in the Arkansas cotton fields in the early 1950s.  But does that make it an outstanding literary work?  It's entertaining, but is it enduring?  I don't think so.  It's a great read with superb characterization and realism.  But while Luke's journey from childhood innocence to experience is realistic, it isn't profound or substantial. Even the metaphor of the painted house is never entirely clear, although perhaps it can be construed as a parallel to Luke's life: In the end, Luke is still a child, but as the novel closes on a chapter of his life, he is like the painted house he leaves behind - his life has been enriched by the paint of another year, and he has matured and grown.  Important themes are touched on, but never really developed as they would in a true literary work.

Important themes are touched on, but never really developed as they would in a true literary work.  But as long as you're not expecting a legal thriller or a literary gem, A Painted House is a slower read, but still an enjoyable one.	2002-04-09

Imagine your father summons you to his death-bed for a final reviewing of his will and his funeral arrangements, and you find him dead...along with a mysterious three million bucks that are completely unaccounted for.  What would you do?  This is the scenario that confronts Ray Atlee in John Grisham's latest thriller.  Ray keeps quiet about the cash, hiding the secret from both the authorities and his chronic alcoholic & dope-pushing brother Forrest, while he tries to uncover the truth behind this bizarre mystery.  On the way, he explores and discovers intriguing truths about casinos and the judicial system.  Both have been frequented by his father the Judge, but neither can seem to be source of a cool three million dollars.  But someone else knows about the three million dollars too, and soon Ray isn't just doing detective work about the origin of the money, but is on the run.  The trademark Grisham suspense is present, but not quite as convincing and heart-throbbing as we might expect.  The conclusion offers a surprising and satisfying twist (albeit somewhat brief), but in the end this isn't the best novel Grisham has written.  Even so, aside from a few profanities, it is mostly free of offensive material and still stands head and shoulders above most contemporary thrillers.  Even though Grisham didn't summon all his thriller skills for this one, you will still find that once you start, you will need to summon all your powers of self-control to put it down.  It might not match Grisham's best, but it still matches the best thrillers that most printing presses are printing.	2002-04-09

The Osterman Weekend doesn't live up to the promise that Ludlum would normally offer for a weekend thriller read.  John Tanner's plans for the weekend are disturbed when he is confronted by CIA agent Fassett.  Fassett tells Tanner that some of the three couples who are coming over to spend the weekend with the Tanners as long-time friends are actually part of a huge international conspiracy code-named Omega.  But Fassett needs Tanner to help uncover which of the couples - the Cordones, the Tremaynes, and the Ostermans - really are part of the Omega conspiracy.  So when the friends of the Tanners visit, the weekend is anything but ordinary, as the various couples hold varying suspicions of each other in a rather icy atmosphere.  It is only in the last quarter of the novel that the action and intrigue really heats up and all hell breaks loose.  For most of the novel, the reader is just as confused as John Tanner, and the last pages really fly by as you try to discover who is really part of the conspiracy.  It's a complex web with various double crossing and threats on all sides.  But until the last few chapters, the book is quite easy to put down, and neither gripping nor convincing, although heavily dosed with profanity.  For a good weekend read, Ludlum has produced much better gems than The Osterman Weekend.  For a more enjoyable weekend, re-read your dog-eared copy of The Bourne Identity or The Matarese Circle.	2002-04-09

In modern America, Christmas suffers from an overdose of materialism and sentimentalism.  At least, that's what Luther and Lora Krank conclude, and so they decide to skip Christmas for a year, and go on a Caribbean cruise instead.  But while skipping the mayhem of crowded malls and credit card debts has much going for it, skipping Christmas turns out to be more difficult than planned.  Luther and Lora fend off all challenges to their plan of skipping Christmas, until an unexpected twist forces them to make a final choice between their Caribbean getaway and the usual Christmas tradition.  The story doesn't have the depth and complexity of a usual Grisham thriller.  But Grisham is a gifted storyteller in whatever he writes, and this is no exception.  It's a story filled with warm humor and even suspense.<br />But especially insightful is the critical look at the traditional Christmas celebration.  Perhaps Luther and Lora's observations are quite appropriate: for most people Christmas really has become too hectic, too hedonistic, not to mention too expensive.  Yes it's full of cliches in every sense, but legitimately so - these cliches about the Christmas season contain a great deal of truth, and give much reason for self-examination!  It seemed to be a shame that these insightful and accurate observations appear to be reversed in the conclusion with a return to Christmas sentimentalism.  Yet perhaps Grisham is suggesting that we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater - while an American Christmas has much that deserves criticism, something of the sentimentalism would be a shame to give up.  So if skipping Christmas isn't quite the answer, perhaps we do need to have a good hard look at our traditions.  Even if we keep the baby, we do need to throw out some bathwater.  This thought-provoking novel forces us to re-examine our holiday traditions, and entertains us at the same time.  And if you're not planning on skipping Christmas, it would also make an excellent gift...gift...	2002-04-09

Henry?  My mouth waters already!  It's hard to imagine any literary treat that can be enjoyed in small doses more pleasurable than this.  I have spent over a year savouring these stories, reading them one by one, tasting his delightful choice of words, digesting his fascinating story-lines, and the warm satisfying afterglow that comes after a typical twist at the end.  O. Henry began writing short stories as a prison inmate, and he quickly fine tuned his skills behind the bars and developed into an excellent storyteller.  Born William Sydney Porter (1862-1910), he produced 270 stories under the pseudonym O. Henry. His stories are superbly outstanding in at least four ways, each illustrated with five of my personal favorites.<br /><br />Firstly, his brilliant use of language.  These stories were written in the first half of the twentieth century, and O. Henry's use of language easily surpasses that of most contemporary writers.  Not only does he have an extensive vocabulary, but his writing abounds with similes and metaphors that breathe sparkling life and depth into his stories, marred only by the occasional \\"Lordy\\".  \\"Ulysses and the Dogman\\" is a fine example of his skills with a language, metaphorically portraying dog owners as victims of Circe, in a hopeless enchantment to their leashed pets.  Also exemplary is \\"Madame Bo-Peep of the Ranches\\" where a ranch manager has a heart fenced by barbwire just like the ranch on which he lives, and yet the twist at the ending suggests that perhaps we were completely mistaken.  \\"A Comedy in Rubber\\" uses wonderfully elevated language to farcically portray a class of people today known as ambulance chasers.  And \\"Sisters of the Golden Circle\\" revolves around the profound bond that exists between two married women who are strangers but yet sisters \\"of the plain gold band.\\"  \\"An Unfinished Story\\" employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor Dulcie's struggle for survival.<br /><br />Secondly, his unique insight into the social conditions of his time.  O. Henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class, and he frequently pictures the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century America with warm and sympathetic colours.  His characters are frequently the overlooked: the struggling shop girl, the unsuccessful artist, the impoverished.  Admittedly, some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers, and the distance that time has placed between us and O. Henry's beloved New York means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to understand and identify with. But his genuine sympathy for the oppressed cannot be missed. \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" is the signature O. Henry story, probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other's prized possession that they have just given up.  Another story which display his ability to picture the social conditions of his time - but always with the trademark twist - is \\"The Pendulum\\", a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man, until the bubble bursts.  \\"The Cop and the Anthem\\" was the first O. Henry story I ever read, and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter - it remains vivid in my mind as a memorable favorite.  \\"The Furnished Room\\" is a tragic and shocking story of suicide, depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished.<br /><br />Thirdly, his warm humour.  O. Henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language.  Frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other.  And on other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others.  One of his most popular stories is \\"The Handbook of Hymen\\", recounting the tale of two men in a winter cabin, one armed with the hilarious Herkimer's handbook of Indispensable Information.  And then there is O. Henry's fictional character Jeff Peters, a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes, two shining examples displayed in \\"Jeff Peters as a Personal Magnet\\" and \\"The Exact Science of Matrimony\\".  \\"Let Me Feel Your Pulse\\" pokes fun at doctors, while in \\"Next to Reading Matter\\" an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane.<br /><br />Fourthly, his ironic twist.  One of the distinctive characteristics of O. Henry's short stories is the ironic twist at the end, which never fails to surprise and entertain, sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner. O. Henry's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed.  Like the Jeff Peters stories, \\"The Love-philtre of Ikey Schoenstein\\" also feature a brilliant scheme - but a scheme of romance - and the way it backfires is unforgettable.  Other delightful examples of ordinary stories with a glorious ironic twist include \\"Witches' Loaves\\" and  \\"While the Auto Waits\\".  The twist that comes at the end of \\"The Hypotheses of Failure\\" is so perplexing, that you'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which O. Henry has misled you.  But perhaps one of O. Henry's best uses of the ironic twist comes in \\"The Last Leaf\\", a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside, and through the self-less sacrifice of another.<br /><br />The Wordsworth collection is superlative, because it contains more than 700 pages of literary gems.  It consists of 100 stories, showcasing a wide range of O. Henry's short-story talents.  A few popular favorites are missing, such as \\"Schools and Schools\\", \\"Shearing the Wolf\\", \\"The Green Door\\", and \\"The Pimienta Pancakes.\\"  But the reality is that nearly all O. Henry's stories feature his trademark ironic twist, as they do his warm humour, his unique insight into the social conditions of the time, and his brilliant use of language, and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion.  The inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring!  Don't pass up on these! - GODLY GADFLYs.

US	51067904	R1P2K9Y8E7R5EO	0785280766	15446057	All Rivers to the Sea (Galway Chronicles, Book 4)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	The last chapter of a brilliant series.	If you have not read the three previous entries in \\"The Galway Chronicles\\" series, you simply must read them first.  But if you who have read them, you will not want to miss \\"All Rivers to the Sea\\", the immensely satisfying conclusion to the series.  The novel commences where volume three left off, with newlyweds Joseph and Kate separated by adversity, and Kate expecting their first child.  But there is hardship on both fronts.  Away in London, Joseph finds his life threatened by murderers.  At home in Ireland, Kate suffers the agony of the death of her own child.  When Joseph and Kate are finally reunited, their suffering continues in the form of a potato blight which destroys the food supply of their staple produce, results in more suffering, pain and death.  Even Joseph and Kate's marriage relationship is strained by sorrow and misunderstanding.<br />In \\"All Rivers to the Sea\\" the Thoenes not only portray the suffering of Joseph and Kate Burke, but also that of another family told in a sub-plot - the Grogan family.  Suffering is epitomized in the Grogan family when they are cast out of their home, totally destitute.  Daniel Grogan first suffers the loss of his wife, and then is forced to place his children in a workhouse.  The horror of the workhouses is painted with stark reality, demonstrating the heartbreak of impoverished parents faced with death, and forced to part with their children by placing them in workhouses, where they suffered under the \\"charity\\" of a corrupt state church (p.117).  The only light in the darkness is that one child of the Grogan family enters the Burke home.  But even this is shadowed with darkness, because it occurs in a manner that has overtones of the birth of Moses (with the older sister watching the cast out child) and the birth of Jesus (with the family not finding room in the \\"inn\\" - in this case, shepherds).  This is no coincidence, because the Thoenes make a strong connection between the suffering of believers and the suffering of Christ.  Kate reminds herself that the scars of suffering \\"make you more like Him\\" (p.185), and some hungry children with simple childlike faith state that they must eat \\"The bread of Christ ... the bread of suffering.\\" (p.199).  And when the suffering are cast out of their homeland, they are reminded by angels \\"Remember Christ the Savior, the child for whom there was no room!\\" (p.302).  The only flaw here is that Kate incorrectly insists that suffering must not be accepted as God's will (p.163), although what she means by this is correct: Don't be passive in suffering, but \\"Pray instead for a clear eye and a firm plan to bring your people relief.  Work hard to make this hard life better for as many as you can.\\" (p.163).<br />The significance of the title \\"All Rivers to the Sea\\" also has to do with suffering. Mad Molly says prophetically \\"We'll none of us survive!  The river flows, don't ye know?  It carried off man and beast, grass and flower, to the sea.  Always to the sea!  It's over for us.\\" (p.153)  Joseph later explains: \\"Life is about people, and not about things or places or land.  A river that rises in the mountains only to die in a bog is a sad, useless thing, Martin.  We must be like the stream that bursts through all dams and finds its way to the sea.  To a new life in a new way.\\" (p.270-1)  And the angels admonish at the end: \\"Remember the River from whence you came!  Remember the Sea which all are bound to cross one day!\\" (p.302)  At the end of the novel there is some taste of justice and redemption.  Yet the bitter taste of suffering remains, forcing Joseph and Kate and the people of Ballynockanor to take drastic measures to ensure their ongoing survival.  With the last chapter of \\"All Rivers to the Sea\\", one chapter of their lives is at an end.  The characters must move on to a new chapter, even if it is clouded with adversity and suffering.<br />Yet it is precisely this that makes \\"The Galway Chronicles\\" so appealing.  Unlike many contemporaryChristian writers, the Thoenes' do not offer us a \\"feel-good\\" pill with a \\"they all lived happily ever after\\" ending.  In the \\"Galway Chronicles\\" they are not afraid to make their readers journey through the depths of tragedy and despair, nor to leave them with a bitter taste in their mouth.  Some readers might prefer a fairy tale ending, but this is real life, not a fairy tale.  And in real life, the presence of sin and suffering is ongoing, even at the end of a book.  The solution is not found in a pretend perfect life, but the solution is found in the work of Jesus Christ who gives hope in the midst of a life of sin and suffering.  The happy ending comes only when this last chapter of history comes to an end, and when He returns.  In this sense the Thoenes' boldness in presenting a harsh picture of a life of suffering, and their refusal to provide a \\"happy\\" ending, is heartily refreshing.  They do not do the gospel a disservice - as so many other writers do - by suggesting that believers on earth can expect happy endings here on earth, before heaven.  These novels show that there is no heaven here on earth, but that the hope of heaven offers real encouragement in a life of earthly suffering.  And that certainly makes them worth reading.Christian writers, the Thoenes' do not offer us a \\"feel-good\\" pill with a \\"they all lived happily ever after\\" ending.

US	51067904	R2LIRB7ALBORO1	0785270167	965200865	Only the River Runs Free (Galway Chronicles, Book 1)	Books	5	28	29	N	N	Award-winning high-calibre Christian historical fiction.	Looking for high calibre Christian historical fiction?  You can't go wrong with the husband-wife Thoene combination (the historical research courtesy of husband Brock, the story-telling courtesy of wife Bodie).  This award winning novel is the first volume in \\"The Galway Chronicles\\" series is a great place to start, exhibiting their fine qualities as a writing team capable of producing novels that rank among the very best.<br />The title \\"Only the River Runs Free\\" reflects the historical setting that the Thoenes' have chosen as the background: Ireland in the 1830s and 40s, when Irish tenant farmers (mainly Catholics) were ruled by the English landlords and soldiers (mainly Protestants).  It was a rule frequently marked by oppression, hence that saying that only the river ran free.  The village of Ballynockanor is no exception, with the Donovan family chief among the poor and oppressed.  The rightful landlord Joseph Connor Burke has been superseded by the greedy usurper Marlowe.  The darkness of the time seems to crush the Donovan family, as they are confronted with tragedy and trial - Kate Donovan has already been made a widow by a fire, but now Kevin seems to be marked as a Irish rebel (\\"Ribbonman\\") deserving death, and Brigit abandons her family only to descend into a even deeper pit of calamity.  But there is hope for the Donovans, and for Ballynockanor, and it lies in the fortunes of Joseph Connor Burke.<br />If evangelical Protestants are going to have any criticisms about this book, it might be that it elicits sympathy for Catholics.  Some Christians may find it difficult to read a book in which the Protestants are the bad guys and the Catholics are the good guys.  However, it has to be remembered that this is simply an accurate portrait of reality, and the Thoenes are reflecting a historical struggle, one that was actually more political than religious in nature.  Rather than endorsing Catholic theology, the authors show that the Irish Catholics were often dealt with harshly and unjustly by the English Protestants who ruled them.  Arousing reader sympathies for the way they were treated is different than arousing sympathies for their theology, and in my view is entirely legitimate.  The depiction of Catholicism is presented by more by a picture of its rituals (crossing oneself, candles, penance) than by its thinking.  In fact, some of the remarks made by the Catholic protagonists (p.233) could be construed as a reflection of the Thoenes' own evangelical Protestant thinking, since it is hardly consistent with Catholic theology.  There is also evidence of modern ecumenism, as is evident in Joseph's dream - likely a mouthpiece for the Thoenes' own convictions - that \\"one day the warmth of God's love may melt the stubborn hearts of all true Christians, be they Catholic or Protestant, to stand and serve Him together as one nation.\\" (p.194).  Unlike the Thoenes, I would not attribute the divide between Protestants and Catholics to mere stubbornness, but to fundamental differences in belief.  Optimism concerning \\"one body\\" and the union of Catholics and Protestants will always be unrealistic as long as the \\"one faith\\" of Ephesians 4 is absent, and where there is no fundamental agreement concerning the truths of Scripture.  But this aside, one does not need to compromise Protestant theology to enjoy this book.<br />The Thoenes write with a flowing and captivating style that grabs your attention throughout with action, intrigue, mystery, and even a touch of romance.  It's a gripping and compelling tale that is entertaining, but doesn't sacrifice realism or historical detail.  Unlike a great deal of contemporary Christian fiction, I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of superficiality.  The historical detail and accuracy of the setting breathes an air of authenticity - this could easily be about real people and real events.  The Thoenes are not afraid to describe the horrors of real life in a dark period of history, where characters must deal with murder, attempted rape, and prostitution.  And yet although it is a tale much deeper than most products of contemporary Christian fiction, it is not so deep that you need boots to wade through it.  The Thoenes have an ability to create a very suspenseful and readable tale that is hard to put down.  \\"Only The River Runs Free\\" was the recipient of the 1997 Gold Medallion Award.  The judges figured it was a novel of the highest class.  After reading it, you'll have to agree that this entertaining and thoughtful novel ranks among the very best. I've read a variety of Christian fiction, and regard myself as a highly critical reviewer, but after reading this book I'm convinced that the Thoenes are among the best.

If you're used to a junk food diet of contemporary easy-to-read thrillers, you'll find \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" tough going.  This is no bag of high-cholesterol potato chips to be consumed in five minutes - this is a sack of solid food to be enjoyed over several evenings!  Unlike the brief attractions offered by a 100-meter sprint, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" offers the scenic adventures of a 100-mile walk.  Don't misunderstand this to mean that this journey is boring.  Most 100-meter sprint type novels provide only momentary and fleeting pleasure, whereas the marathon journey of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" provides an enduring and challenging journey, with a multitude of memorable pleasures.<br />Whose journey is it?  At the face of it, it is a journey undertaken by the hobbit Frodo and his companions.  Frodo possesses a most powerful ring, and the only way to prevent this ring from ever falling into the hands of the powers of evil is to destroy it - in the very heart of the kingdom of evil.  \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" describes the epic journey of the ring-bearer Frodo and his companions as they journey into the heart of enemy territory to do battle with the powers of evil.  If they successfully accomplish their quest, they will assure the  conquest of evil by good.<br />But it is not just Frodo who makes this marathon journey.  Tolkien has an uncanny ability to ensnare the reader, so that you will find yourself not just a spectator, but a participant in the marathon mission undertaken by Frodo and friends.  As you travel the journey with the ring-bearer Frodo and his company, they will become more than mere travelling companions.  They will become your friends.  You will feel you know them, and you will grow to love them - their joys will excite you, their sorrows will hurt you, their conquests will delight you, their failures will grief you.  And it will pain you to say goodbye to them all at the end.<br />Like the journey itself, however, participating in the journey by reading the trilogy can be tough going.  At times the travelling through the words is slow and tough going.  But at other times the pages fly by fast and furious with high paced action.  And precisely this makes the epic journey through the treasured pages of Tolkien so rewarding.  As a reader, you find yourself sharing in a very fantastic and yet very real journey, one which encompasses all of real life's emotions and experiences: sorrow as well as joy, inactivity as well as action, pain as well as pleasure.  While reading, you partake in the emotions and experiences of fantasy characters - hobbits, dwarves, elves, and the like - because these emotions and experiences are distinctly recognizable - morally these characters are so much like ourselves, and we recognize aspects of ourselves in them.<br />What's more, in the course of this long journey, you will be presented with breath-taking scenery.  Tolkien has a remarkable ability to describe scenery with colour, character and clarity, so that you will visualize every tree, rock and road.  By the time you are done, the setting of Middle-Earth will be as real as any place you've visited.  As such, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not just about a story and a journey, it is about a place.  This place, you will discover, is immense and grand, because Tolkien has created cultures, histories, and languages.  The vast scope of the journey and place in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" makes it a truly epic novel.<br />In fact, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" has all the qualities of an epic - an immense scope, combined with a heroic and grand style.  Tolkien constantly displays a mastery of the English language - the word usage at times gloriously grand, at times passionately poetic, at times wonderfully descriptive, but always amazing.  Together, the vast scope and elevated style combine to create a truly epic masterpiece, so that the three volumes of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" read like three acts of tremendously immense play, with a global cast of characters, and a worldwide stage.  And as you read, you are never quite sure whether this play is going to be a tragedy or triumph, as the powers of good seek to overcome the powers of evil.<br />This struggle between good and evil that actually makes \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a deeply religious book.  Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and although he adamantly maintained that it was written for pure entertainment and had no deeper meaning,  he could not avoid being influenced by his religious background, as is evidenced by his sharp view on morality, where good and evil are viewed as moral absolutes.  The epic struggle between good and evil occurs on a wider scale than in \\"The Hobbit\\", and this gives the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a much more serious tone, arising out of deeply rooted religious convictions.  Yet the struggle of good against evil never becomes simplistic or shallow.  As in real life, Tolkien's characters have weaknesses and flaws, and are affected by their experiences - some on the side of good even being corrupted by evil.

And as you read, you are never quite sure whether this play is going to be a tragedy or triumph, as the powers of good seek to overcome the powers of evil.<br />This struggle between good and evil that actually makes \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a deeply religious book.  Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and although he adamantly maintained that it was written for pure entertainment and had no deeper meaning,  he could not avoid being influenced by his religious background, as is evidenced by his sharp view on morality, where good and evil are viewed as moral absolutes.  The epic struggle between good and evil occurs on a wider scale than in \\"The Hobbit\\", and this gives the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a much more serious tone, arising out of deeply rooted religious convictions.  Yet the struggle of good against evil never becomes simplistic or shallow.  As in real life, Tolkien's characters have weaknesses and flaws, and are affected by their experiences - some on the side of good even being corrupted by evil.  And this makes the epic struggle for truth, freedom, justice and goodness all the more stimulating as you return to real life.  One cannot be unaffected by the commitment and undying devotion towards the cause of good, even when it requires unselfish sacrifices to be made in the process.

The second entry into Bodie and Brock Thoene's \\"The Galway Chronicles\\" nearly matches the magnificence of the award winning first volume, \\"Only the River Runs Free.\\"  The cast of characters remains relatively unchanged, as the changing political winds of Ireland in the 1840s create new conflicts.  The novel is rooted in history: the British \\"Act of Union\\" in 1800 stripped Ireland of self-government, and led to opposition to the ruling British on two fronts: the violent rebellion movement by the Ribbonmen, and the peaceful Repeal movement seeking lawful abolition of the Act of Union.  The intensity of this struggle is the catalyst for most of the struggles in \\"Of Men and Angels\\", and forms the nucleus of the novel, giving it much more of a political flavour than its prequel.  Joseph Connor Burke is conscripted by the leader of the Repeal Movement, Daniel O'Connell, and finds that his political allegiances place him at the mercy of the British oppressors, many of whom are willing to go to any lengths to squash Joseph's support for the Repeal movement.  With political enemies bent on nothing less than total destruction of Repeal, a terrible outbreak of small pox in the village of Ballynockanor is the last thing needed.  But it is hardly the last adversity that Joseph must face.  Accidents and arson result in a fast paced plot, and a gripping story-line that is hard to put down.  There's even a touch of romance, as the possibility of Joseph hooking up with the widow Kate Donovan becomes a more and more pressing and realistic question.<br />My only criticisms would be that the evil characters are occasionally rather one-dimensional and flat.  Moreover, the authors downplay the fundamental divide between Protestants and Catholics.  Although it is true that much of the divide can be attributed to politics rather than religion, yet one must be cautious not to express too much optimism about unity between Catholics and evangelicals.  Unless they come to agreement on the fundamentals of the Christian faith such a vision will always remain a dream.  Any theologian who digs beneath the surface will have to affirm that Catholics and Protestants today remain sharply divided on key points of doctrine.  But those weaknesses aside, the Thoenes deserve high commendation for this excellent work in at least four respects.<br />Firstly, they have created a successful and suspenseful story-line.  Unlike many Christian writers, they are not guilty of creating sub-standard fiction.  This is fiction of the highest calibre, with a skilfully portrayed setting, realistic characters, and captivating plot.<br />Secondly, the novel is not marked by an overly optimistic view of life which characterizes much popular Christian fiction.  Many writers plunge their characters through a multitude of dangers, but leave them unscathed and alive at the end.  Such novels may be enjoyable, but they can not avoid the criticism that they are escapist.  The Thoenes, however, are not afraid to portray life as it really is, even though it is often a harsh reality.  They are not afraid to let their protagonists be afflicted by diseases, or even to have them die.  Let's face it, that's real life.  This realism may be harsh, but by facing up to reality, the Thoenes make it possible to convey important truths about how to endure the harsh realities of real life and impart important lessons for today's readers.<br />Thirdly, the historical context is not merely incidental, but is thoroughly at the heart of the novel.  It is a completely convincing fabric on which the Thoenes paint the events of \\"Of Men and Angels\\".  It enables readers to gain an awareness and appreciation for the struggles underlying Irish history, struggles that still leave their unmistakable mark on present day Irish politics.<br />Finally, this series conveys important and enduring truths about living the Christian faith in today's world.  The Thoenes make it clear how God helps his people even in the face ofhorrendous evil.  Only in fairy tales do people live happily ever after, but the Galway Chronicles make it clear that even where people don't live happily ever after, God uses pain and adversity as a refining fire to make them stronger in their faith.  The authors also make no bones about drawing connections to contemporary politics.  Their condemnation of the evil methods employed by the Ribbonmen has an unmistakable relevance for today: using violence for a good cause cannot be justified.  The lesson for the struggle in Ireland today, and the condemnation of typical IRA methods does not miss the mark.  The contemporary struggle in Ireland has its roots in the history that the Thoenes describe, and their endorsement of a lawful repeal movement as an alternative to revolutionary rebellion is as applicable today as it was then.<br />It's not hard to see that this novel - like its prequel - is a remarkable success.  By the end of the novel, Repeal is not accomplished, and there are many unfinished loose ends that make the reading of volumes 3 and 4 of the series necessary.  But if volumes 1 and 2 are anything to go by, reading the rest of this series will be a most rewarding pleasure!horrendous evil.

In \\"Ashes of Remembrance\\", Bodie and Brock Thoene's story about the lives of Joseph Connor Burke and Kate Donovan take a turn towards adventure.  The book starts out with joy, as the long awaited romance between Joseph and Kate culminates into a wedding.  But shouts of joy soon turn into tears of sorrow.  Immediately after the wedding, Jospeh is arrested and charged with treason.  Meanwhile, Colonel Mahon has his eye on Burke's estate, and through his trickery Joseph is sentenced to transportation for life ... to Australia.  And our favorite characters all return, including Mad Molly, whose prophetic babbling and busy-bodying again proves to be essential.<br />Unlike the earlier two novels of \\"The Galway Chronicles\\" series, \\"Ashes of Remembrance\\" is less political and less theological. But what it lacks in spiritual depth, it makes up for in adventure and excitement. At sea, Joseph faces hardship, cruelty, the elements, and shipwreck.  It is somewhat of a pleasant change of pace from the first two novels, and it's an adventure story well told.  At home, Kate faces murderers and kidnappers who are willing to resort to any measures to get hold of Burke's land.  The brutal suffering perpetrated in the religious struggles of the Irish is not absent, but functions more of a backdrop for the evil personal ambitions of Mahon.  But whether at home with Kate or at sea with Joseph, the adventure is non-stop.<br />The Thoenes are sensitive to the fact that real Christians do experience real suffering.  They are not afraid to depict Christians being the victims of real tragedy and betrayal.  In fact, this suffering is thematic in this novel.  The title \\"Ashes of Remembrance\\" originates in the simple wisdom of the nurse Miss Susan, who explains to Kate how trials and sorrows play an important part in one's life, and make you stronger.  \\"Back home they set fire to the canefield before they cut the cane.  Burn away the leaves and rubbish so's they can press the cane to make sugar ... Life ain't nuthin' but a canefield.  Sorrows burn away the trash.  A person finds out what matters and what don't.  What's left is the sweetness.  Pressed out, boiled down, and purest crystal.  One day, Miss Kate, you tastes the sugar and don't remember the ashes no more.\\" (p.87-88)  It's profound wisdom.  By the end of the novel, we discover that all the sorrows are not yet over, and that we need to read book four to taste the sweetness.  The sorrows of \\"Ashes of Remembrance\\" may eventually turn to sweetness for Kate and be forgotten, but for the rest of us, this is definitely a tale of adventure worth remembering.the cane to make sugar ...

If you've been introduced to the Disneyfied 1960s movie version of Mary Poppins, prepare to meet the *real* Mary Poppins.  And prepare to be shocked, because the real Mary Poppins of 1934 is no smiling Julie Andrews.  Of course there must be some appeal, otherwise this book would never have gained its status as a modern classic.  Mary Poppins enters the home of the Banks family as a replacement nanny to take care of the four children, and her entrance into the home causes an immediate stir.  Her remarkable ability to slide up banisters, walk into pictures, make humans float to the ceiling, and communicate with animals are just a few of her array of startling talents.  In her presence the Banks children are never short of magical adventures.<br />It sounds exciting and innocuous enough.  But don't be fooled.  These magical adventures are not entirely harmless.  Mary Poppins is actually a witch whose heart is far from pure.  True, Travers doesn't ostensibly present Mary Poppins as a witch, but her magical abilities clearly originate in a form of paganism closely connected to Eastern religions and new age philosophy.  Nowhere are Mary Poppins' credentials as a witch more evident than a night-time incident when the Banks children find themselves in a zoo, with all the roles reversed - the facility is run by animals, and the cages contain humans.  The fun is hardly innocuous, because there is talk of animals eating humans, and in the Snake House Mary Poppins' true heritage is revealed - she is a first cousin (once removed) to the serpents, one of whom she regards as the \\"Lord of the Jungle\\".  Her kinship to the snake with the \\"terrible little forked tongue\\" is deeply rooted in Eastern philosophy, evident in what the snake hisses: \\"The same substance composes us - the tree overhead, the stone beneath us, the bird, the beast, the star - we are all one, all moving to the same end ... Beast and bird and stone and star - we are all one, all one - &quot;  This new age philosophy is far from harmless fantastic fun, but is frighteningly sinister.<br />And if that isn't enough, Mary Poppins is herself a most beastly character.  Her vanity knows no limits, as she constantly examines her reflection in every polished doorway.  She is must cruel and unkind towards the children, showing them little or no affection.  One critical writer once observed that Mary Poppins is `perhaps the most stodgy, negligent, abusive, elusive, misleading (and misguided), vituperative, vain and priggish beast ever conceived in the mind of an author.'  It's a cruel assessment of Mary Poppins, but not far from the mark.  The Banks children spend most of their time cowering in fear of her, never sure if she is going to treat them with meanness or magic.  And whenever they are treated to magic courtesy of her witchcraft, she immediately messes with their minds by denying that it ever happened.  Even the old woman in the shoe was more kind than this.<br />Yet that's not all to the twisted adventures of Mary Poppins.  One entire chapter, Bad Tuesday, features one of the Banks children in a most disobedient mood, taking great pleasure and delight in his evil deeds.  It gives him a most wonderful feeling.  Sadly, this behaviour is encouraged rather than discouraged.  In another incident, the children travel around the world and meet stereotyped people from all four corners of the earth.  Not surprisingly, this chapter has been majorly `revised' in the 1981 edition, which has softened Travers' original political incorrectness by changing these people to different animals from around the world.<br />Despite her despicable character, when Mary Poppins leaves the Banks family at the end of the novel, the children are surprisingly most distressed at her sudden departure.  They reject their mother's soothing words of comfort, asserting `Mary Poppins is the only person I want in the world!'  Please!  What poor fools!  The truth is that the Banks family is a rather disfunctional family, and father and mother Banks play such a limited role in the lives of their children, that these four children would mistakenly rather have this beastly witch than nothing.  Surely they are wrong.  Despite the lure of her magic, a normal home and functional family is more blessed without the real Mary Poppins.  I for one don't want this haughty and disagreeable character in my home taking care of my children.

Since their publication a century ago in 1902, Kipling's \\"Just So Stories\\" have pleased children and adults alike.  Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907, Kipling was a prolific writer for both adults and children, but the \\"Just So Stories\\" continues to be regarded as one of the favorites of Kipling's work.  Unlike some of his other works, his imperialist political viewpoint is not evident, but it exhibits only his superb skill at amusing children by his writings.  This is a collection of a dozen short stories which display his remarkable ability to enchant the reader - especially children - with the written word, and makes for excellent \\"bedtime\\" story reading for young children.  It's not hard to see why so many readers speak of it with unrestrained enthusiasm.<br />Yet as a Christian I could not wholeheartedly share the boundless devotion of most readers, and my own enthusiasm was more restrained.  Kipling is evidently familiar with the Bible and the Christian faith, because he makes frequent allusions to Biblical concepts and history, such as Noah's ark.  \\"The Butterfly that Stamped\\" even features king Solomon and the Queen of Sheba as two main characters.  Although both of Kipling's grandfathers were Methodist preachers, he abandoned his family heritage, stating \\"Three generations of Wesleyan ministers ... lie behind me.\\"  Kipling' conscious departure from the Christian heritage is also evident in the \\"Just So Stories\\".  Even in \\"The Butterfly that Stamped\\" he presents king Solomon and the Queen of Sheba as married, something not revealed in Scripture.  Moreover, in many of his stories he presents an evolutionary approach to the creation of the world.  \\"How the First Letter was Written\\" features a Neolithic Cave Man, and \\"The Cat that Walked by Himself\\" describes the \\"taming\\" of a wild man, wild dog, wild horse, wild cow, and wild cat.  Judging charitably, it has to be admitted that many of his stories are presented as clearly absurd, nonsensical and fantastic.  One could hardly maintain seriously that in stories like \\"How the Whale got his Throat\\" and \\"How the Camel got his Hump\\" Kipling is trying to present an alternate creation account.  Nonetheless, Kipling does more than just present a fantastic creation account, but in the process is rather disrespectful and mocking of the real creation account, especially in \\"The Crab that Played with the Sea\\" which features an \\"Eldest Magician\\" making the world by a magic, and also \\"The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo\\" which features three gods.  But perhaps Kipling's true feelings toward the Bible are most clearly evident in \\"How the Leopard got his Spots\\", where he refers to grown-ups saying \\"Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the Leopard his spots?\\" - a direct quotation from Jeremiah 13:23! - and says \\"I don't think even grown-ups would keep on saying such a silly thing if the Leopard and the Ethiopian hadn't done it once - do you?\\"  Here Kipling shows his true colours.  No amount of charity can justify Kipling speaking of the Word of God as \\"a silly thing\\".  It's unfortunate that the literary qualities of these stories are not matched by spiritual fervour.  Christian parents will want to be selective in which stories they read to their children.<br />Yet the literary qualities of these stories cannot be denied.  They are probably best enjoyed when read aloud to children, and feature a charming, and warm style that is absolutely nonsensical and yet completely captivating. \\"How the Alphabet was Made\\" is perhaps one of the few exceptions - it is a creative concept, but is somewhat tedious and lacks the charm of the other stories.  But nearly all the other stories are delightfully told and wonderfully enjoyable in their exaggerated nonsense.  For instance, in \\"How the Whale got his Throat\\", Kipling introduces the reader to a man \\"sitting on a raft, in the middle of the sea, with nothing on but a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders.\\"  As in many of his stories, his use of repetition skilfully warms up a smile on your face.  Throughout the story, he repeatedly and gently admonishes the reader \\"you must NOT forget the suspenders, Best Beloved\\", \\"Have you forgotten the suspenders?\\"  It seems absurd, but in the end proves to make perfect sense, because it is the suspenders that the man used to tie his raft in the whale's mouth, and that's how the whale got his throat!  Totally absurd, but frightfully funny!<br />At the same time, Kipling uses his nonsensical style to convey fables about animals which satirize human values and vices.  For instance,  \\"How the Camel Got His Hump\\" is a satirical commentary on laziness and procrastination. This is the hallmark of Kipling's style in most of the stories, and it is this exemplary literary quality that has rightly gained this work the fame it deserves.  This edition also reproduces Kipling's original pen and ink drawings, complete with his delightful commentary explaining the illustration.  It's worth adding to your collection, because all readers will find something here that they can enjoy.

I have to admit that this book has an odd title.  The \\"Five Children\\" part is easy enough to figure out - that refers to Robert, Anthea, Jane, Cyril, and their adorable young brother who has the pet name \\"the Lamb\\".  But what on earth is \\"It\\"?  As it turns out, \\"It\\" is a Sand-fairy, or Psammead.  And like the title, the Psammead is odd.  \\"It\\" is small, round and furry with snail-like eyes and bat-like ears.  But the Psammead's odd-ness is matched by its extraordinary potential.  It has the power to grant one wish a day, lasting until sunset.  And so when the five children stumble across this magical Psammead while playing in a gravel-pit, they quickly learn that wishes can come true!<br />But the children soon discover that having your wishes come true is not always as pleasant as it might seem.  Wishes for beauty and wealth result in an unexpectedly bitter after-taste that confirms that these much coveted wishes are not as grand as most people think.  Other wishes lead to harrowing adventures, such as being in a beseiged castle, and being stalked by Indians.  Still other wishes result in rather bizarre scenarios, such as having wings, being the size of a giant, or being grown-up.  But in each case the children soon end up yearning for time of day when the wish will come to an end, as one of them remarks: \\"We're getting into the habit of longing for sunset.\\"<br />But as a reader of this tale, you'll find yourself quickly wishing for day-break, and for another exciting day to begin with another exciting wish to be fulfilled.  This book may have been written about 100 years ago in 1902, but it hasn't lost any of its charm. When Edith Nesbit wrote this book (her first \\"magic\\" book) it was an instant success. It is equally beloved today - and with good reason!  The magical adventures are full of charm and excitement.  Yet they convey important moral lessons, such as the transitory nature of beauty and wealth - &quot;neither had exactly made them happy.\\"  Generally speaking each chapter features a new wish and a new adventure that lasts until sunset.  It's a great read-a-loud book for young children, guaranteed to enthral and please with its wonderful blend of magic, adventure, and humor.  I must warn you that when the book does come to an end, you will be disappointed.  But only because it means the end of the children's enthralling magical adventures!

He \\"didn't know what to do with himself.\\"  Until a mysterious package arrived in the mail, containing \\"one genuine turnpike tollbooth\\", which Milo assembles, and finds himself driving through into a fantastic land of words and numbers.  This land features two main cities: Dictionopolis (marked by a love of words) and Digitopolis (marked by a love of numbers).<br />In Dictionopolis, Milo is faced with the peculiarities of the English language, as abstract words turn into concrete individuals.  He meets the Spelling Bee (who is always spelling words), a Which called Faintly Macabre (who is not so wicked), and the Whether man (who says its more important to know whether there will be weather, rather than what the weather will be.)  At the word market place, he has the opportunity to buy a bag of pronouns, and letters of the alphabet.  After an encounter with the police Officer Short Shrift, Milo ends up in the palace of king Azaz.  Here he meets the cabinet, composed of a duke who makes mountains out of molehills, a minister who splits hairs, a count who makes hay while the sun shines, an earl who leaves no stone unturned, and an undersecretary who hangs by a thread.  Dictionopolis is inhabited by strange fellows such as these and the unforgettable Kakofonous A. Dischord (Doctor of Dissonance), as well as a strange places such as the \\"Island of Conclusions\\" (which you get to, of course, by jumping).<br />Juster's word play is so skilful and delightful, that at first you suspect that this wordy excellence will be impossible to match when Milo visits Digitopolis, the city of numbers.  But not so - the fun keeps right on going.  Whereas Dictionopolis had offered food like synonymn buns and required banqueters to eat their words, Digitopolis offers a diet with things like subtraction stew (the more you heat, the hungrier you get).  Numbers are so essential, Milo discovers, to measure the height of high hopes, and also because narrow escapes come in all different widths.  And as for the smallest number, it is infinitely small that it is kept in a box so small you can't see it, in a dresser so small you can't see it, in a house so small you can't see it...  Milo tries to travel along a long line to the Land of Infinity, but is told that he probably won't like the land, and that \\"infinity is a dreadfully poor place.  They can never manage to make ends meet.\\"<br />With his two faithful companions - the watchdog Tock (who \\"ticks\\" instead of \\"tocks\\", and whose body is the face of a watch\\"), and the Humbug - Milo goes on a perilous journey to rescue the two lost princesses, Rhyme and Reason.  As you would expect, without Rhyme and Reason the lands of words and numbers have become rather chaotic. There are a variety of obstacles and enemies on the way, including the Everpresent Wordsnatcher (who literally takes the words right out of their mouths).  To rescue the princesses, Milo and his company need to travel to the Mountain of Ignorance.  Logically, the creatures who live in Ignorance are rather dangerous, but Milo manages to outwit them, rescue Rhyme and Reason, and returns through the tollbooth back into his real land.<br />Comparisons with Lewis Carroll's legendary \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" are inevitable and perfectly appropriate. \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" is an award winning classic that will please adults as well as children for generations to come.  Juster demonstrates a superb ability to make the abstract concrete, and to produce an unending stream of puns and plays on words and concepts.  Yet unlike Carroll's \\"Wonderland\\", Juster's world is not nonsensical, but makes a great deal of sense.  Words and numbers are dealt with strictly, literally, and logically.  Because he has created a world that is new and apparently nonsensical, and yet one that plainly makes perfect logical sense, Juster's world is exceedingly understandable and enjoyable.  For instance the fact thata Spelling Bee is a buzzing bee that actually spells is a fantastic notion, and yet one that makes more sense than what we've always thought a spelling bee was. This is a nonsense world that makes perfect sense.<br />Yet Milo returns from this world as a changed individual.  He has gained a new insight and appetite for the joys of words and numbers. A few tantalizing quotes to whet your own appetite:  About expectations: &quot;Expectations is the place you must always go to before you get to where you're going. Of course, some people never go beyond Expectations...&quot; About a box filled with words - &quot;Most of them you will never need, some you will use constantly, but with them you may ask all the questions which have never been answered and answer all the questions which have never been asked. All the great books of the past and all the ones yet to come are made with these words. With them there is no obstacle you cannot overcome. All you must learn to do is to use them well and in the right places.&quot;  But Juster also shares insights about real life.  From the Terrible Trivium - \\"demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs, ogre of wasted effort and monster of habit\\" - Milo learns that by doing enough unimportant things you'll never get to where you're going.<br />So it is that when Milo exits the tollbooth, he has a renewed perspective on life, and is no longer the boy who didn't know what to do with himself.  The tollbooth has changed him.  When he says goodbye to the tollbooth, he says hello to the real world, a world awaiting discovery and exploration.  But the phantom tollbooth has a very real capacity to have the same effect on you the reader.  If you are a bored little boy like Milo, this book might just change your outlook on life! And if you already love puns, and plays on words and numbers, you'll love this book anyway.  Be sure of one thing: a journey through the phantom tollbooth is thoroughly enjoyable!a Spelling Bee is a buzzing bee that actually spells is a fantastic notion, and yet one that makes more sense than what we've always thought a spelling bee was.

US	51067904	R3VWCV6RI24NM3	0061006629	388121391	Fatherland	Books	4	32	33	N	N	A brilliant concept.	Brilliant.  No, not the plot, which is certainly above average, but mostly typical of a good suspense thriller.  What's brilliant about Robert Harris' \\"Fatherland\\" is the concept.  The events of this suspense thriller are set in 1964, in post World War II Germany.  Nothing unusual so far.  Until you realize that Germany has won the war, Europe is dominated by the victorious German reich, and that celebrations are underway for Hitler's 75th birthday.  It is this alternate history that makes \\"Fatherland\\" a thriller that stands out from the average.<br />Is it plausible?  Harris is well-qualified to write such an alternate history, having written a well-researched non-fiction book on Hitler.  In fact the events of \\"Fatherland\\" are mostly rooted in history, as Harris notes at the end of the book that many of the characters whose names are used in this novel actually existed, and many of the documents quoted in the text are authentic.  The novel centers around the historic Wannsee Conference of 1942, where Hitler's top men met to decide on a permanent solution to the Jewish question: extermination in the horrific gas chambers in places like Auschwitz.<br />The plot itself is credible and fast moving, although those who are offended by vulgar language, blasphemy and immorality will find these occurring rather too frequently.  Xavier March is a criminal investigator who is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery around the body of an old man found floating in a lake outside Berlin.  His investigation leads him to discover a series of deaths of high ranking officials.  Together with Charlotte Maguire, an American journalist, he uncovers the chilling truth and the heart of the dark conspiracy behind these deaths.  But can March and Maguire escape the German reich with a story about a secret so horrible that Hitler's men have done everything possible to remove all trace of?  And if they are caught, can they withstand the torture that is sure to follow?<br />The concept of a political cover-up, government conspiracy in at the highest level, and those threatening to expose it being silenced with death, is not a new concept.  But by dressing this concept in new garments of an alternate history, Harris has created a novel that surpasses the average suspense thriller.  The alternate history is in many respects fictional, but at its core it is about a horrible reality that is just as shocking today as it was when it was conceived in 1942.  In producing \\"Fatherland\\", Harris has fathered a novel with a concept so brilliant, that the chilling non-fiction aspects of its story become all the more shocking.  And that's why this is a novel not worth missing.of a political cover-up, government conspiracy in at the highest level, and those threatening to expose it being silenced with death, is not a new concept.

US	51067904	R2LFN42853CNMF	0891074961	471862848	Tilly	Books	2	10	41	N	N	Not up to Peretti�s regular high standards.	Tilly is a short novel that will take little more than an hour of your time to read.  In his usual style, Peretti combines a creative plot with real emotions and deep themes.  Without giving away the twists of the story-line for new readers, it can be said that the chronicle of events is fascinating and moving.  As always, Peretti crafts a suspenseful and successful story.<br />What is not so successful however is Peretti's treatment of the theme of abortion. Admittedly there are some redeeming qualities:  Peretti makes abundantly clear the Scriptural truth that an aborted fetus is a real baby.  The idea that there is an after-life for all aborted babies (though the implicit assertion that all aborted babies go to heaven is questionable) is also Biblical.  He also is sensitive to the post-abortion anguish and distress experienced by many mothers, a reality many pro-abortionists frequently diminish.<br />But it is doubtful that he is sufficiently harsh on the sin of abortion, as evidenced by the fact that some pro-abortionists have remarked that this book is not overly pro-life, and have even found comfort in it!  Rather than expose the seriousness of a sin which is nothing but murder, `Tilly' suggests that those guilty of abortion can find comfort in the fact that their aborted children are alive in heaven and have forgiven them.  But is it true that the path to healing lies in the knowledge that all aborted babies are happy in heaven and that parents can be reconciled with them?  Scripture suggests something different, as David confesses in Psalm 51: sin is first of all sin against God - `against you, you only have I sinned.'  The true path to healing is to confess sin to God and find reconciliation and forgiveness from Him.  Peretti implicitly advocates a different approach, where reconciliation and healing is sought in the wrong place - with the aborted child instead of with God.<br />The danger with this approach is that it encourages a form of reconciliation without repentance.  Rather than shock people guilty of abortion with the reality of their sin, it softens the blow.  It may not be his intention, but the result is that Peretti implicitly suggests that there is a path to God's forgiveness independent of confession and repentance.  Ultimately Peretti fails to come to grips sufficiently with abortion as a sin and so also doesn't sufficiently uncover the real solution for those guilty of this sin: confession to God and forgiveness from God through Christ.  Peretti has made some brilliant contributions to contemporary Christian fiction.  Unfortunately, because of its fundamental flaws, this isn't one of them.thout repentance.

Who hasnt heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table?  Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced  tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice.  But were the knights really so noble and courageous?  Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthurs sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasnt quite so glamorous.  Heres a taste of his delightful humour: As a general thing  as far as I could make out  these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers  duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.  Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond.  Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable.  There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didnt seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry  perhaps rendered its existence impossible. (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then.  It was several years cruise.  They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I dont think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*. (p54)<br />Sound wickedly funny?  Hank Morgan doesnt stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance.  Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization.  Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men  some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as missionaries to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards.  It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive miracles, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement.  Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper.  All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres.  He discovers that being a knight isnt as glamorous as its made out to be, because you cant even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose.  Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hanks plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.<br />Twains irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication.  Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past?  If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure.  Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century?  It is clear that the protagonist  the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions  embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals.  The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff).  Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to King and Church and noble (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108).  He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific miracles appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science.  The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgans scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles.  What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesnt convert King Arthurs court to naturalism.  By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthurs court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.<br />I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism.  It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology.  But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love.  The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century  they are conquered and die.  Is Morgans death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny?  The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that societys optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity.  Twains disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviour<br />To get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twains humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twains parody.  He occasionally quotes Malorys fifteenth century classic Morte dArthur  deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended.  To appreciate the conventions and idealshe is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.<br />Its a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldmans farcical and popular The Princess Bride look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids.  Not only is it funny, but theres a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness.  Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth.  It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twains brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling.King Arthurs court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.<br />I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism.

US	51067904	RK2X095K8IC3Y	0684834030	561066364	Cain	Books	2	2	7	N	N	A Christian Frankenstein?	Cain is the book which established Huggins in mainstream fiction and was later developed into a movie.  It follows the formula he began with novels like Leviathan, where scientific experimentation unleashes a super-human creature hell-bent on destroying the world.  In this case, the scientific meddling has resulted in Cain, a virtually indestructible super-soldier with an unquenchable thirst for human blood.  Cain is especially after the blood of Amy, a young girl whose blood he needs for an occultic ritual that will guarantee his complete supremacy.  Like Leviathan, Cains hunters are faced with an ultimatum  they must kill the unkillable within ten days, or else he will destroy the world.  Cain was the first murderer, and he threatens to be the last (p45).  What to expect:<br />1. Action thriller.  The novel starts with a bang, and rarely slows down.  Huggins has a style that leaves your heart pounding, and youll find yourself racing over words and through pages.  The roller-coaster ride of action never lets up.  Only one problem: expect the same scenery.  The terrible roar of Cain and the hate-filled rage of his hunters rapidly wears thin after the umpteenth time.  While the action is fast and furious, the battles become rather repetitive and tiresome, and are marked by episodes that defy credibility.  Also be warned that the extent of blood and gore is unsuitable for children.<br />2. Apocalyptic themes.  Unlike most thrillers, Huggins clearly works with deeper themes.  There is a clear and cosmic conflict between good and evil, a picture of the conflict between God and Satan.  Cain is no ordinary super-human, because his body has no human soul but is inhabited by Satan himself, who allies himself with various occultic associates.  Over against Cain is the soldier Soloman, whom Huggins identifies in the line of king David, and representative of the Gods kingdom. Both David and Soloman are shadows of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Christ Himself.  Because the Nazarene (Christ) has already defeated Satan once, Cain/Satan is eager to exact vengeance. Huggins clearly intends the conflict against Cain to be a spiritual picture of the great struggle against Satanic evil (p.40,55).  The present, if we are to survive at all, must mirror the oncoming final conflict between God and Satan. (p114)  The battle against Cain is ultimately a microcosm of the great and last battle between Christ and Satan, as Huggins reveals in the acknowledgements: I have done my best to capture what we cannot see  the heart of an eternal war, if it be true, between the two most powerful beings in the cosmos.  In this war Soloman and the Catholic priest Marcelle are Messianic figures, Marcelle in Christ-like fashion sacrificing his own life for the sake of victory.<br />However, it is doubtful whether Huggins is successful in his depiction of spiritual war.  The spiritual war that the Bible speaks of is a very real war involving true Christians, whereas Huggins protagonists are far from that.  Moreover, Huggins cheapens spiritual war, turning it into a techno-thriller combat movie with repeated bloody battles between thugs and goons.  It is more like cheap Hollywood violence than a serious treatment of spiritual war.  But the real war against Satan is not like Hollywoods entertaining blood and gore.  Admittedly Huggins has developed as a writer since his earlier novels, and his characters are more developed.  But this doesnt detract from his fatal flaw: this is more in the style of Hollywood than in the style of heaven and hell, more about Rambo than about religion.<br />Whatever religious meaning the novel does have to offer is further undermined by the stream of hate and curses unleashed by its heroes, the surprisingly frequent instances of blasphemy and unnecessary oaths, and the overdose of murderous hate.  Consider these brief excerpts: Stumbling, he cursed savagely as he tripped backwards over a small golden couch.  And Cain roared in laughter, horrific bestial fangs violently exploding from his jaws like prehistoric tusks.  The hellish mirth made his face fiendish, fangs hurling back the light with an ultimate killing wrath. (p.141) With a curse, Soloman leaped the hood of a car and went into the stairwell, expecting to be hit instantly.  But he didnt give a damn because he was in a hot mode to kill anything that got in his way regardless of what happened to him in return. (p.336)  Heated, on fire with killing rage, Soloman slammed six fresh rounds into the shotgun, cursing as he racked it (p.357).  Its not hard to see why Hollywood find it an attractive book to make into a movie.  That fact alone should make sincere Christians suspicious.  Its more about the glorification of violence as a form of entertainment than it is about a serious message.  In fact, the focus on murderous rage violates the sixth commandment, and doesnt fit the Scriptural standard for what Christians should be thinking about (Phil. 4:8). Using apocalyptic themes doesnt justify joining Hollywood in violating the sixth commandment.<br />In the end, I felt that I was reading a formulaic script for a Hollywood Frankenstein movie, rather than a Christian thriller novel.  That a serious spiritual message can be communicated to fans of violence is highly doubtful.  They are too busy giving kudos to Hollywoods blood and gore to take home any truth about heaven and hell.  As long as people identify the real Satan with a warped scientific Frankenstein, they remain blind to Satans very real supernatural threat to todays world.

In this book you meet them all  including the magician Merlin, and the brave knights Sir Lancelot, Sir Gareth, Sir Tristam, Sir Bors, Sir Key, and Sir Galahad.  All the old favorites are included  Arthur drawing the sword out of the stone, Arthur receiving the sword Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, Arthur becoming emperor, and Arthurs marriage to Guinevere.  These events are recounted with surprising little drama.  But dont give up too soon  the best comes with all the quests and adventures of the knights that follow, including the Quest for the Holy Grail.  This book is chock-full of entertaining adventures involving knights in shining armour, damsels in distress, fierce jousting and sword fights to the death, battles against hoards of enemies and giants, tournaments and miracles.  Accompanying the text of this hard-cover, are ornate black and white pictures and images that contribute splendidly to the atmosphere evoked by the text.<br />The medieval setting is painted in a rather idealized fashion, limited to the nobility and figures of the court, who embrace all that is beautiful, brave and noble.  These virtues are sometimes portrayed rather simplistically, as unknown knights engage in mortal combat, and only after they have virtually killed each other do the introductions begin: What is your name?  Behind this medieval mayhem is a heightened sense of chivalry more reflective of legend than fact, where knights battle to the death for the sake of a woman - even one they have only just met.  But isnt that what the Arthurian legends are all about?  Nobody is under the illusion that they are to be taken too seriously.  Journeying to Arthurs Camelot is a form of escapism - suspend your sense of disbelief, watch the flashing swords and fearful battles, and enjoy.<br />Thats not to say that the Arthurian tales do not reflect any reality.  Arthurs world is in many respects a real medieval world.  Medieval beliefs in paganism and Christianity are evident throughout.  Witchcraft and enchantment is presented as alive and deadly, and conversely the true religion  in this case the beliefs of the medieval Catholic church  is evident throughout as knights commend themselves to God in prayer, thank him for his help, and even repent from their sins.  The whole notion of the Holy Grail is of course a very Christian tradition  although a tradition that represents more fiction than fact.  And the moral virtues of justice, truth and right for which the honorable knights fight are still noble ideals of virtue today. Arthurs kingdom is presented as a kingdom blessed by the grace of God, a beacon of light symbolizing all that is good and true and right, and a worthy model for kingdoms in todays world because it revolves around timeless virtues.  Tales that promote dignity, courtesy, courage, respect for right, respect for female dignity and purity are as ennobling as they are entertaining.<br />How much truth there is behind the Arthurian tales will always be the subject of debate.  The fact remains that there is an extensive and confusing body of legend to wade through.  In this 1923 work, Knowles has essentially followed Malorys fifteenth century classic Morte dArthur.  Even his language is antiquated and tedious, but persevere because you will soon find that this an enjoyable and essential addition that heightens the heroic atmosphere of the story and gives the legend a fittingly majestic touch.  But it is doubtful that Malory or Knowles have been successful in making a great deal of sense out of the confusing mass of legend, because it is not unified in a plausible manner.  Those looking for a more readable or easier introduction to king Arthur would be better served by the works by Roger Lancelyn Green or Howard Pyle.<br />In the end these tales of King Arthur and his knights remains a hodgepodge of anecdoteswith different styles that is sometimes hard to wade through.  But that doesnt matter.  This collection is primarily of historical value, in giving a true picture of the original legends as they have been transmitted across hundreds of years.  Even if its not always easy to read, it cannot be denied that Knowles has produced a very comprehensive collection of the Arthurian tales, and the unbelievable exploits of knights in shining armour will continue to entertain in the future just as they have done in the past.  Along with the tales of Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced.  This is the stuff of legend, and its worth a read.ard to wade through.

Along with the tales of Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced.  This is the stuff of legend, and its worth a read.	2001-10-10

Unfortunately most mystery writers are a little short on the \\"good\\" side, or else short on the \\"clean\\" side.  In \\"The Omega Network\\", Thomas Locke excels on both points.  Chase Bennett works for the chamber of commerce in a Florida town, but as a result of his connections he soon finds himself uncovering a major criminal network, with money supplied by narcotics being used to corrupt politicians and force the establishment of a mega casino.  The big boys behind the bad business are prepared to go to any lengths to make sure their ambitions to bring gambling to Florida succeed.  But as Chase discovers, behind the big money of the casinos are bad people.  Soon Chase finds his own life threatened because of the corruption and connections he has discovered.  The ending is somewhat weak, and Locke doesn't capitalize on the suspense that he has built up.  But that aside, it's a good mystery story, liberally sprinkled with a tinge of romance.<br />Not only is it good, it's also clean.  The language is decent, and the main characters are church going people who strive to live decent lives not marred by adultery or violence.  Locke is himself a Christian, and he brings across a subtle Christian message without being superficial or preachy.  There are no artificial conversion stories, but just the ordinary struggles of believers living in a corrupt world.  The focus of the corruption that Locke exposes is the evil of legalized gambling.  In the process of reading this mystery, you'll be confronted with some shockingly accurate facts about gambling, the corruption it creates, and the destruction it causes in the lives and communities of \\"ordinary\\" gamblers.  Locke shows convincingly that because legalized gambling is a great money-spinner for the government, the authorities often turn a blind eye to the moral and social destruction it inevitably results in.  Not only is \\"The Omega Network\\" a great read, but this good clean mystery will leave you with a new perspective on gambling.  You won't be gambling by reading this book, because it's a guaranteed winner.ystery will leave you with a new perspective on gambling.

The Jackal is the code name for an elite and elusive Englishman employed as a political assassin.  Both a master marksman and a master of disguise, his target is the much loved and much hated French President, Charles de Gualle.  It is 1963, and after various failed attempts on the President's life, his political enemies finally hit on a scheme with the sound of success: by employing a paid outsider - the Jackal.  Forsyth chronicles the ruthless Jackal's elaborate preparations for the hit, and his fail-safe measures that appear to ensure the success of his daring scheme.  But the mastermind can only succeed if he can elude the sleuthing bloodhounds on his tail, as detectives, police forces and secret services around Europe are fully warned and engage a huge security net to trap the cold-blooded calculating Jackal.  With nail-biting suspense, Forsyth unravels the plot, the Jackal always one step ahead of his pursuers.  The suspense increases in relentless fashion until the moment of truth, as the Jackal slowly, gently squeezed the trigger...<br />The fast-paced plot is marred only by the fact that it is not entirely clean.  There are a few incidences of blasphemy, and the unchaste behaviour of two women features prominently in the Jackal's rise and fall.  But on the whole Forsyth treats us to a flurry of action, and heart-stopping suspense and tension.  The concept of a manhunt for an elusive political assassin with a brilliant plot may seem tired, but the reality is that Forsyth was one of the first to use it.  The intrigue and accuracy of French politics is compelling.  This highly acclaimed thriller won the 1972 Edgar Award for Mystery Fiction a year after it was first published.  Lovers of espionage and thrillers will not quickly grow tired of it thirty years later, because this suspense thriller is deservedly a classic in the genre.

Who hasn't heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table?  In this book you meet them all - including the magician Merlin, and the brave knights Sir Launcelot, Sir Gareth, Sir Tristam, Sir Bors, Sir Kay, and Sir Galahad.  All the old favorites are included - Arthur drawing the sword out of the stone, Arthur receiving the sword Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, and Arthur's marriage to Guinevere.  But this is just the beginning of excitement - followed by numerous quests and adventures of the knights, including the Quest for the Holy Grail.  This book is chock-full of entertaining adventures involving knights in shining armour, damsels in distress, fierce jousting and sword fights to the death, battles against hoards of enemies and giants, tournaments and miracles.<br />The medieval setting is painted in a rather idealized fashion, limited to the nobility and figures of the court, who embrace all that is beautiful, brave and noble.  These virtues are sometimes portrayed rather simplistically, as unknown knights engage in mortal combat, and only after they have virtually killed each other do the introductions begin: \\"What is your name?\\"  Behind this medieval mayhem is a heightened sense of chivalry more reflective of legend than fact, where knights battle to the death for the sake of a woman - even one they have only just met.  But isn't that what the Arthurian legends are all about?  Nobody is under the illusion that they are to be taken too seriously.  Journeying to Arthur's Camelot is a form of escapism - suspend your sense of disbelief, watch the flashing swords and fearful battles, and enjoy.<br />That's not to say that the Arthurian tales do not reflect any reality.  Arthur's world is in many respects a real medieval world.  Medieval beliefs in paganism and Christianity are evident throughout.  Witchcraft and enchantment is presented as alive and deadly, and conversely the true religion - in this case the beliefs of the medieval Catholic church - is evident throughout as knights commend themselves to God in prayer, thank him for his help, and even repent from their sins.  The whole notion of the Holy Grail is of course a very Christian tradition - although a tradition that represents more fiction than fact.  And the moral virtues of justice, truth and right for which the honorable knights fight are still noble ideals of virtue today.  Arthur's kingdom is presented as a kingdom blessed by the grace of God, a beacon of light symbolizing all that is good and true and right, and a worthy model for kingdoms in today's world because it revolves around timeless virtues.  Tales that promote dignity, courtesy, courage, respect for right, respect for female dignity and purity are as ennobling as they are entertaining.<br />How much truth there is behind the Arthurian tales will always be the subject of debate.  The fact remains that there is an extensive and confusing body of legend to wade through.  In this work, Green has essentially followed Malory's fifteenth century classic \\"Morte d'Arthur.\\"  But unlike most other writers, such as Sir James Knowles, Green has made some significant improvements:<br />1. Firstly, the traditional Arthurian tales are a confusing mass of legends.  But Green consciously weaves all the tales together as part of a single pattern.  He needs to take some liberties with legend in order to achieve this, but these alterations are minor, and the end result is a plausible reconstruction with a clear development, revolving around the establishment of Arthur's kingdom, its climax with the successful quest for the Holy Grail, and subsequent downfall.<br />2. Secondly, most other collections slavishly follow the body of legend inherited by Thomas Malory.  Green follows Malory in the main, but has researched the legends carefully for himself, and also incorporates some Arthurian legends not found in Malory.<br />These innovations of Green result in a very readable and successful version of the Arthurian tales, and yet one that does not significantly sacrifice faithfulness to legend.  Those looking for a more historical reflection of the Arthurian tales would do well to turn to a version of Malory, such as that by Sir James Knowles.  And those looking for a more developed and extensive modern version where the author has taken liberties beyond the original legends, would enjoy the classic work by Howard Pyle.  But as a faithful, plausible and enjoyable introduction to the tales, you can't go wrong with this superb effort by Green.<br />Most readers looking to be introduced to the Arthurian legends need look no further than this collection by Green.  It's not as grand as Malory, but it's a better read.  There is no end to the accomplishments of sword and sorcery, adventures and quests.  To our sorrow, Arthur's kingdom ends in darkness and disgrace, but not before it has shone with a wonderful and memorable light.  Along with the tales of Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced.

The Princess and Curdie is a superb sequel to the brilliant childrens fantasy The Princess and the Goblin.  In both books, MacDonald displays his incredible talent as a story-teller for children, by crafting a tale that makes great reading aloud material for children.  Curdie, a miners son, is sent by a magical princess on an urgent quest to save the king and his kingdom.  His companion is Lina, an ugly monster of a dog who proves to be a steadfast, powerful and courageous companion.  Curdie discovers that evil and wickedness threaten to overthrow the good kingdom of the king and his daughter Irene, and it is only when Curdie and Lina escape perils and dangers and marshal together the forces of good that the dangers can be overcome.<br />In the process of telling the story, MacDonald entertains a few curious notions rather surprising for a Christian.  Especially surprising are the ideas of a mountain being bubbles of heat thrust from the center of the earth (p.2), and the earth being a cooled body that flew off the sun (p.3)  ideas more akin to evolutionary thinking than Christian faith in the Biblical teaching about creation.  This book is also somewhat different from The Princess and the Goblin on a literary level, because in this book MacDonalds story-telling at times employs vocabulary and sentence structure that is overly complex for children, and at times he waxes overly philosophical.<br />But those weaknesses aside, its a thrilling and captivating story of an exciting quest, enhanced by deeper underlying Christian themes. MacDonald describes the king as a real king  that is, one who ruled for the good of his people and not to please himself. (p.5).  True citizens of this kingdom, such as Curdies parents, are those who always loved what was fair and true and right better, not than anything else, but than everything else put together. (p.35)  In contrast there are many false citizens who have open doors but closed hearts, and who live a life of wickedness, chiefly characterized by lying, drinking, stealing and unkindness.  These seeds of corruption also contain the seeds of destruction, and threaten to overthrow the kingdom.  The morality is clear and solidly Christian.<br />Particularly fascinating is the concept that all humans are either noble human beings, or else slowly turning into animals on the inside.  By putting his hands into a magical fire, Curdie is given the ability to perceive the inner layer of man by means of a handshake: you will henceforth be able to know at once the hand of a man who is growing into a beast. (p.73)  One cannot help but wonder if MacDonald has too much faith in human nature, since he does not spell out that it is only the regenerating Spirit that makes a heart true and noble.  But the underlying truth is valid: all mens hearts are inclined to be beastly because of sin, but by the grace of God some hearts are changed to be noble and truly human. It echoes the truth of the teaching of Jesus Christ: where your heart is, there your treasure is, and ultimately you cannot serve both God and Mammon.  Those who are overwhelmed by wickedness and by love of Mammon, are eventually destroyed, whereas those with a pure heart and love of God establish the kingdom of righteousness.  The pessimism of the final ending raises many questions, but perhaps can be best explained as a growing wickedness among men leading to a complete and final judgment, similar to the flood and the end of the world.  MacDonalds tale is in the end very reminiscent of the Biblical pattern of the Judges and Kings: in times of wickedness, God raised up judges and kings to ensure the establishment of a kingdom where justice and righteousness reigned.<br />Just as in the The Princess and the Goblin, Irenes great-great-grandmother plays a central and decisive role.  She is also known as The Mother of Light, the Lady of the Silver Moon and less affectionately as Old Mother Wotherwop.  MacDonald attributes to her both omniscience  I am always about  and a measure of omnipotence (p.53).  She is the Light that guides the way in darkness (p.50), and she it is who commissions Curdie for his quest and ensures its success.<br />These timeless tales contain enduring truths, as well as delightful stories.  What theyve done for over 100 years is something that they are still doing today - pleasing imaginative children and adults with a tale of lasting significance.tes to her both omniscience  I am always about  and a measure of omnipotence (p.53).

Colin Thiele has garnered a well-deserved reputation as a brilliant contemporary Australian writer, and this short story collection is another of his brilliant successes.  Sadly, these stories are marred by Thiele's tendency to use blasphemy.  But that aside, he is a remarkably gifted writer, and this collection of short stories goes a long way to showing why.<br />As is the case with many of his books, many of these short stories reflect Thiele's own roots as a German immigrant, accurately depicting German immigrant life.  But what stands out most about this collection of Thiele's stories is his remarkable ability to depict ordinary life with surprising colour, and warm humour.  Probably the most exemplary and enjoyable story in this regard is the first, \\"The Great Spa Disaster\\".  The would-be handyman dad whose failures and foibles are presented with delightful humour is distinctly recognizable and familiar - he could be any Australian.  It's a story so positively brilliant, it will leave you in fits of laughter.<br />Thiele's style in the other stories is more subdued, but no less enjoyable.  From the suspenseful story of two children who get lost in \\"The Cave\\", the tale of the engineering skills of the neighbour Mr. Bolkus in \\"The Great Greenhill Billycart Grand Prix\\", and the yarn about the clumsy dog who becomes the most unlikely hero in \\"The Glory of Galumph\\", this collection of eight stories short and tall is guaranteed to keep you amused and entertained.

Who hasn't heard of Robin Hood and his merry band of outlaws in Sherwood Forest?  In this book you meet them all - including the powerful Little John, courageous Will Scarlet, musical Allan a Dale, and sly Friar Tuck.  Roger Lancelyn Green has researched the legends and ballads about Robin Hood, and this collection of Robin Hood tales rivals the authoritative collection by Howard Pyle which has been unequalled for more than 100 years.  But Green corrects one notable omission in Pyle: the absence of Maid Marion.  In addition to the ample adventures revolving around Maid Marion, all the old favorites are included - Little John and his quarter-staff toppling Robin into the water, Robin winning the golden arrow at Nottingham's archery contest, and the Sheriff being outsmarted in numerous attempts to capture Robin.  But these are just the tip of the iceberg - this book is chock-full of entertaining merry adventures.<br />The medieval setting is portrayed beautifully, including the vast gulf between the upper and lower classes of society, the corruption and greed of the nobility, and the hypocrisy of the medieval Roman Catholic church where religion has degenerated to mere outward rituals.  But the medieval setting is not presented without a social commentary - Green shows that the unbalanced social structure inevitably resulted in the oppression of the poor and weak.  Robin Hood and his band are clearly Catholics, and they are motivated by a genuine love for God and for the King.  It is left to Robin Hood and his men to take justice into their own hands, and fight nobly for the cause of the downtrodden.  Such justice is accomplished in a questionable manner, because the notion of robbing the rich to help the poor implicitly endorses civil disobedience.  But Green points out that Robin Hood is motivated by justice and not revenge, and acts only because the lawful authority of King Richard has been replaced by an unlawful usurper.  The theme of seeking justice and maintaining truth and right is in itself a noble one.  With Robin Hood, we find ourselves wanting justice, and being prepared to make unselfish sacrifices in order to achieve it.  When justice is done, it is actually the greed and corruption of the nobility that has led to its own destruction and ruin.<br />But the real attractions of this gem are the enthralling exploits of Robin Hood and his band of merry men.  Comparisons with the classic Howard Pyle collection are inevitable.  Green's collection of tales is equally well researched and equally comprehensive.  Although the absence of Pyle's antiquated language is an improvement, Green's collection is still in the end inferior to Pyle's. Pyle's Sherwood Forest is a rather glamorous utopian world where feasting and song abound, where it is never winter, and where the ale rarely runs dry.  Robin Hood clearly represents a form of hedonism, and in his company there is never a lack of action, adventure, or for that matter - ale.  Green's Sherwood Forest is ironically less \\"green\\" than Pyle's, and lacks the hedonistic feasting and song, and lacks the sense of atmosphere that Pyle so skilfully evoked.  Green's action and atmosphere fails to match the excitement and merriment that Robin Hood deserves, and he seems to have taken the \\"merry\\" out of Robin Hood and his band of outlaws.  In this case the grass really was \\"Greener\\" on the Pyle side of the fence.<br />But that is not to detract from Green's superb effort.  If you can't get Howard Pyle's \\"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood\\" or can't endure his antiquated language, then don't look further than this collection by Green.  There is no end to the accomplishments of muscles and mind, as Robin and his merry band outwit all comers by sheer physical skill in archery, wrestling, swordmanship, and quarter-staff combat, or by outsmarting them with deceit and disguise.  To our delight, Robin's brawn and brains always come out on top at the end.  Along with the tales of King Arthur, the tales of Robin Hood are the most exciting tales that British history has produced.  Green's collection of Robin Hood's merry adventures is still constantly entertaining and exciting - one that you'll want to own and read over and over!e tales of Robin Hood are the most exciting tales that British history has produced.

It's Christmas Eve 1957, and an English pilot is flying his single-seat fighter from Germany, on his way home for Christmas.  But when the electrical circuits fail, he is suddenly on his own in a lonely sky, unable to contact the men below who alone can guide him home through the foggy skies.  With fuel running out, radio contact gone, and navigation impossible, and when it seems that he's destined to ditch only to freeze to death in a deserted sea, a miraculous saviour appears.  A World War 2 style plane appears out of the gloom, and its brave pilot \\"shepherds\\" the helpless flyer down through the frosty night sky towards safety.  Will he succeed?  And why does the airport seem deserted?  And who is the mysterious shepherd?<br />Although \\"The Shepherd\\" is a very short novel that can easily be read in under an hour, it doesn't hinder Forsyth from capturing your attention.  He cleverly heightens the intensity of the action and suspense by using the first person point of view.  The stricken pilot's fears and bewilderment quickly become your own, until they are resolved in a spine-chilling last-page climax that raises as many questions as it answers.<br />The gripping plot is marred only by a few incidences of blasphemy.  But the paperback edition is beautifully enhanced by Lou Feck's full-page black and white illustrations.  \\"The Shepherd\\" may be a departure from Forsyth's usual fare in that it is a short and sweet Christmas story that exploits the season's fondness for supernatural miracles.  But it lacks none of his trademark spine-tingling suspense.  Unlike the pilot, it will be a while before you come back down to earth after reading this one!	2001-10-05

There people who dont are few and far between.  One of the biggest influences on C.S. Lewis was this man, George MacDonald (1824-1905).  It was MacDonalds talent for telling fairy stories that inspired Lewis in writing his own.  Like Lewis, MacDonald has a remarkable ability to tell a delightful and enchanting story for children, layered with strong Christian themes and imagery by means of allegory and symbols. The Princess and the Goblin is one of his most beloved works for children, and an excellent introduction to his style and success.<br />The Princess and the Goblin features a heroine  a princess called Irene  and a hero  a simple miners son called Curdie.  While working overtime in the mines to earn money to buy his mother a red petty-coat, Curdie chances upon the goblins who live in the mountain, and discovers that they are hatching an evil plot against the king and his palace.  Meanwhile the princess makes a discovery of her own  high in the castle she finds a wonderful old lady who is her great-great-grandmother.  The problem is, nobody else knows of her grandmother, and nobody believes her.  But the princess does believe, and it is by her faith in her grandmother and the magic thread that she receives from her, that she is able to rescue Curdie.  Together they rescue the entire palace from disaster at the hands of the goblins.<br />In telling the story, MacDonald has an enchanting conversational style, wonderfully suitable for reading aloud to enraptured children  an ability perfecting in telling stories to his own eleven children.  But The Princess and the Goblin is more than just a story.  Before pursuing a literary career, MacDonald was a Congregationalist minister, and so integrates important underlying Christian themes.  Believing in the great-great-grandmother despite the fact that many cannot see her, is a symbol of believing in God.  MacDonald uses this to show how the Christian faith involves believing without seeing, and that not everyone has to see something for it to be true.  The grandmothers lamp and magic thread are the guides on which the princess must depend, much like the Word which is a lamp on our path.  It may sound tacky, but it works.<br />Children are not likely to grasp the deeper underlying themes that MacDonald is working with.  Nonetheless the story has a clear message for children.  The clear conflict between the royal powers of light against the goblin powers of darkness is unmistakable.  Moreover, the princess is presented as a model of virtue, and MacDonald frequently asserts the importance of moral virtues such as always telling the truth, keeping your word, and admitting your faults  moral virtues that are equally important for princes and princesses of Gods kingdom.  Courage, honesty, grace, dignity and beauty are timeless ideals for children of all times to strive for.  If you love Narnia, youre sure to like this one, and youll find yourself quickly grabbing the sequel, The Princess and Curdie.  The Princess and the Goblin was one of J.R.R. Tolkiens childhood favorites, highly regarded by C.S. Lewis, described by W.H. Auden as the only English childrens book in the same class as the Alice books, and generally considered as a classic example of nineteenth century childrens literary fairy tales.

After her father is murdered, Katy's determination to find her father's killer brings her to the construction site of the transcontinental railroad.  With her partner Sam Bronte, Katy uncovers a ruthless plot to sabotage the railroad project, and finds herself faced with murderous and money hungry villains who will stop at nothing to achieve their aims, even if it means Katy and her companions need to be \\"eliminated.\\"<br />\\"Imperial Intrigue\\" is the second volume in the series, and describes Katy and Sam's new assignment in protecting an Austrian prince and princess who are settling down on a ranch in the American West.  Katy soon shares in the struggles faced by the foreign royal party: adjusting to ranch life, befriending the ranch family, facing the murderous attempts of a greedy neighbouring rancher to take over the property, and avoiding death at the hands of a skilled assassin.<br />What NOT to expect:<br />1. Solid theology and a thought provoking message.<br />Typical of much evangelical thinking, this book offers only shallow theology.  Typical are the ideas that heaven will be \\"enriched\\" by a wonderful Christian (\\"Tracks of Deceit\\" p.45), a false contrast between an Old Testament God of justice and the New Testament God of love (p.129), the idea that it is entirely wrong to judge someone even from their lifestyle (p.195), the pop-psychology assessment that an evil self-centred life is not really sin but rather indicative of being \\"seriously sick...insane.\\" (p.216), the secular notion that Christians must learn to love themselves more (\\"Imperial Intrigue\\" p.178), and that it is possible for an unbeliever to be \\"basically a good person.\\"  Despite the fall into sin, the authors have rather too much faith in human nature, which is probably not surprising considering their Arminian theology (p.50,142).  Such shallow thinking is evident throughout, and results in a grinding down of the gospel of Christ into a super-sweet sugar coating and sprinkling it over the story-line.  Also of concern is the Biblical thinking that is missing from these books.  Instead of focussing on the \\"unseen\\" heavenly promises, the authors focus with nauseating regularity on the \\"seen\\" qualities of physical beauty and physical attraction (\\"Tracks of Deceit\\" p.76,164, \\"Imperial Intrigue\\" p.32,47).  When this secular focus was combined with a liberal dose of sappy romance (\\"Tracks of Deceit\\" p.125, \\"Imperial Intrigue\\" p.81) where characters habitually wind up kissing at their first meeting or soon afterwards, at times I could hardly believe I was reading a Christian book.<br />2. Strong characterization.<br />Katy herself is rather one-dimensional.  While barely shedding a tear over her father's death, she immediately goes off to play detective and find his murderer.  Although the characterization does improve in \\"Imperial Intrigue\\" (especially the attention devoted to the internal relationships of the ranch family), on the whole the characterization leaves much to be desired.  Even the unbelieving \\"good guys\\" are surprisingly unselfish or else become Christian at the tip of a hat, whereas the \\"bad guys\\" have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and are nearly always presented as \\"human monsters\\" that are always evil all the time.<br />3. A surprising and unpredictable plot.<br />The authors left so many clues that one of the surprising plot twists at the end of \\"Tracks of Deceit\\" came as no surprise whatsoever, but was instead entirely expected.  When there are surprises, in both books they are frequently the result of most remarkable coincidences that are hardly credible, and thus hardly satisfying.  Although \\"Imperial Intrigue\\" was certainly more credible and convincing than &quot;Tracks of Deceit\\", weaknesses are still evident - among them an incident where the authors resort to having one of the characters have an unexplained urge tovisit a grave in the middle of the night (p.195) in order to get three of the characters out of the house.

The order in which the Narnia Chronicles should be read and published is a matter of great controversy. In my view, the answer to this question lies in a proper understanding of the deeper level of Narnia. When read on an adult level, the Narnia Chronicles function as a powerful medium used by Lewis to impart powerful spiritual truths about Christianity and theology. But these spiritual truths are conveyed more by Biblical allusions than by rigid allegory. This also has implications for the order of the volumes in this series.<br /> The publishers of this edition have elected to follow the chronological order of the series: 1. The Magician's Nephew; 2. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe; 3. The Horse and His Boy; 4. Prince Caspian; 5. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; 6. The Silver Chair; 7. The Last Battle. The chronological order makes the books more strictly allegorical than they really were intended to be, and gives the impression that they are an extended allegory rather than incidental allusions, an incorrect impression in my view. Despite all the talk about allegory, it seems to me that Lewis is more fond of incorporating Biblical allusions where and when he pleases, rather than working with a strict and rigid allegory that tightly binds the plot. Certainly the central Biblical themes of creation, fall, redemption and consummation are present, and form the broad chronological coat-hanger on which the series rests. But ultimately Lewis does not want us to become obsessed with chronology, but with content.<br /> Thus there is something to the vehemence with which so many readers argue that the books must be read in the order in which they were first published, namely: 1. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe; 2. Prince Caspian; 3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; 4. The Silver Chair; 5. The Horse and His Boy; 6. The Magician's Nephew; 7. The Last Battle. While it is true that this originally published order is not chronological, it does enhance the process of discovery about the magical world of Narnia, and slowly uncovers various aspects of its history.<br /> It must be conceded that in a letter written in 1957 (published in \\"Letters to Children\\"), Lewis did appear to state a mild preference for the chronological order. But in that same letter Lewis concluded: \\"So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them.\\" Surely Lewis' own conclusion is correct. Although my personal thoughts are that the originally published order is perhaps to be marginally preferred, in the end each book is a separate story and an independent glimpse into the exciting world of Narnia. It is the understanding of the allusions that deserves our attention, not an artificial reconstruction of a complicated allegory. These allusions do not need to be artificially joined together in a strict chronological sequence to be enjoyed - they are equally profound and enjoyable as they were read by the first readers, namely, in the originally published order.very about the magical world of Narnia, and slowly uncovers various aspects of its history.<br /> It must be conceded that in a letter written in 1957 (published in \\"Letters to Children\\"), Lewis did appear to state a mild preference for the chronological order.

Now I know why they were trying to get rid of it.  The story line revolves around a husband and wife who team up to write books about their travels.  If you haven't read the first book in the series, the relationships between the characters can be hard to figure out.  For the record, the main characters are Tony and (Dr) Priscilla (Price) Shadowbrook.  The Shadowbrooks have two daughters, twins Kathy and Christina (Kit), and two sons, Mark (married to Amanda and father of Cooper) and Josh (engaged to Melody).<br />In this volume, the Shadowbrooks visit Jerome, an old Arizona copper mining town.  The intriguing beginning immediately arouses interest, as they bump into an eccentric traveller carrying his own tombstone - marked with the approaching date of his death!  But aside from the last two chapters - which contain an exciting and suspenseful concoction of murder and mystery - the book really doesn't live up to its early promise.  Most of the content revolves around the Shadowbrooks and the book about Jerome they are working on.  After a while, it dawned on me that the book the Shadowbrooks are producing was the very one in my hands!  It sounds like a novel idea, but the novelty soon wears thin. After reading sentences like &quot;Can we use any of that scene in our book?&quot; for the fourth time (p.165), I began thinking: &quot;Just get on with the book!&quot;  It soon gets a bit tiresome to hear the husband and wife writing team arguing about a suitable title, deciding what events to incorporate, and giving each other kudos for their brilliant writing in the previous chapter. The fictional Shadowbrook is supposedly a famous writer, having ardent fans constantly bow at his feet, and is mentioned in the same breath as Clancy and Grisham (p.168).  But Copper Hill makes it painfully evident that Bly is no Clancy and no Grisham!<br />But I suspect the real Bly and the fictional Shadowbrook have a great deal in common.  Can it be a coincidence that both Bly and Shadowbrook are writers of Westerns?  That they have authored books with the same title?  That the Shadowbrook husband and wife team are writing a book about Jerome called Copper Hill, just like the Bly husband and wife team?  The connections between the Shadowbrooks and the Blys are too strong to be ignored.  Secretly I wondered how much of the Shadowbrook's marriage and family is simply a reflection of the Bly's own life, particularly because a great deal of the book concerns the ins and outs of a marriage relationship hampered by menopause and trivial family squabbles.  In this respect Copper Hill did have the potential to give a solid message about marriage and the family.  But any positive message is sadly cheapened by the frivolousness of the conflicts.  A mother of the bride who suddenly decides she's opposed to a backyard wedding, convinces herself that wedding rings are pagan symbols, and wants to add a train to the wedding dress - all just days before the wedding?  Puh-lease!  When will the silliness stop?  Of course it does stop in the last two chapters when the murder mystery really heats up, but by that time it is really too late.  Hampered further by some questionable theology about spiritual warfare (p.34 &amp; 155), and a lack of courage in applying Biblical absolutes (p.68-72), this book is in the end a rather unfortunate disappointment.  On its own, the cocktail of mystery and murder had the potential to be a winner.  But when combined with a watered down mix of marriage and menopause, the final cocktail sadly turned sour.Bly and the fictional Shadowbrook have a great deal in common.

This first volume in the series \\"In the Hall of the Dragon King\\" introduces us to young Quentin, an assistant in the temple of Ariel, who forsakes aspirations of priesthood in order to undertake an important mission for the Dragon King Eskevar.  This leads to a quest to save Eskevar from the hands of his evil brother Prince Jaspin, who harbours selfish ambitions to take over the crown.  Quentin and his great war horse Balder are joined in this quest by the religious hermit Durwin, the renowned outlaw Theido, the prison warder Trenn, the good Queen Alinea, the mysterious nomad Toli, and the brave knight Ronsard.  But Jaspin proves to be a mere pawn in the hands of the evil necromancer Nimrood, and it is from the clutches of this corrupt wizard that the King must be rescued.  Quentin and company face perils of many kinds, including the dreaded Harriers, and a long journey through the lands of Mensandor and Elsendor to the dreaded Karsh, the desolate home of Nimrood. <br />In volume two of the series \\"The Warlords of Nin\\" Quentin has matured into a young adult and made his home in Dekra, far away from his beloved Bria.  Along with his companion and friend Toli, Quentin heads back to the royal castle at Askelon at the urgent summons of King Eskevar, who detects an impending danger that threatens the empire.  All the signs, including the bizarre and ever-brightening Wolf Star, point to a perilous time.  The danger proves to be a serious one indeed: Nin the Destroyer, with his four warlords, and thousands of soldiers.  Quentin and Toli escape from the clutches of one of the warlords along with the defector Myrmior, who turns out to be a most helpful ally.  Myrmior's cunning and clever strategy does a great deal to slow the advance of the army of Nin threatening to overwhelm Askelon.  But in the end, victory depends on the fulfilment of an archaic prophecy about a Priest King, who will bring deliverance armed with a mysterious sword known as the \\"Zhaligheer\\" or \\"Shining One\\".  It seems the Quentin is the fabled Priest King, and in obedience to the prophecy, he undertakes a mission to the lost mines of Ariga, along with the armorer Inchkeith, to search for the rare and fabled lanthanil needed to make the sword.  Will he accomplish his mission on time?  Is he the one of whom the prophecy speaks?<br />In \\"The Sword and the Flame\\", the third title in the series, Quentin has assumed the throne, with Bria his queen.  The kingdom firmly established, he is busy building the King's Temple, a temple dedicated to the Most High.  And he is armed with the enchanted sword, whose flame symbolized the support of the Most High.  But enemies old and new are fiercely opposed to Quentin's overturn of the old gods.  The evil necromancer Nimrood returns to collaborate with the defenders of the old gods - the priests at the temple of Ariel, who see the construction of the King's Temple as a sign of the inevitable destruction of their own High Temple.  Suddenly, the peace of Quentin's kingdom becomes overshadowed by darkness.  His son is kidnapped, a close friend killed.  Quentin must face open hostility from his enemies, even treachery from his own supporters.  But worst of all the flame of the sword goes out, and the hopes for the kingdom appear to be extinguished along with it.  The ensuing struggle makes this book the most emotional and introspective of the series, as it focuses on Quentin's loneliness, his deep, dark and total despair, which nearly extinguishes his faith.  Lawhead treats this subject with raw and gripping emotion, precisely the ability later developed and fine-tuned that made the \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" so powerful.  Perhaps even more compelling than the glory of a kingdom, is the tragedy of a fallen king, who is so distraught that he rejects the Most High and tumbles into the depths of despair.  In the end, the tide turns when Quentin renews his faith.  The climax is particularly powerful, with unforgettable scenes reminiscent of the confrontation on Mount Carmel between Elijah the prophet of the Most High and the prophets of Baal.  <br />Each story can be read independently, since each volume introduces a new conflict which is resolved by the conclusion of the book.  But the tales of the Dragon King trilogy are so exciting, that once you have read one, you'll want to read them all!	2001-07-04

If you are expecting something like Lawhead's profound and satisfying \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" when reading the \\"Dragon King\\" trilogy, prepare to be disappointed. This is the Lawhead \\"Lite\\" version, because it lacks the depth of description, character and emotion present in many of Lawhead's other works. Undoubtedly, this is more entertainment than the literary fiction of those offerings. But it would be unfair to criticize Lawhead too harshly for this, because this series was born in the infancy of his career as a writer. Readers familiar with the more polished and developed Lawhead as evident in his later work would do the man an injustice by measuring his first work by the incredibly high standard of his more mature efforts. As a series geared towards the level of teens rather than adults, and where the reader is not under the false expectation that it contains the majesty and depth of the \\"Pendragon Cycle\\", this is still a great read.<br /><br />This first volume in the series! \\"In the Hall of the Dragon King\\" introduces us to young Quentin, who undertakes an important mission to rescue the Dragon King Eskevar from the traitorous Prince Jaspin and the evil necromancer Nimrood. The king can be rescued from the corrupt wizard only after Quentin and his friends make a perilous journey to the dreaded Karsh, the desolate home of Nimrood. In volume two of the series \\"The Warlords of Nin\\" Quentin has matured into a young adult, and must defend the royal castle and the kingdom over against the deadly Nin the Destroyer, with his four warlords, and thousands of soldiers. Victory is only possible when Quentin is armed with the enchanted sword Zhaligheer, but first Quentin must make a dangerous journey to search for a rare and fabled substance needed to make the sword. In \\"The Sword and the Flame\\", the third title in the series, the adult Quentin has assumed the throne and is busy building a temple dedicated to the Most High. But the evil necromancer Nimrood re!turns and collaborates with the defenders of the old gods against Quentin. The flame of the sword goes out, and the faith of the king and the hopes of the kingdom appear to be extinguished with it.<br /><br />The strength of the series is the constant battle between good and evil, the powers of light and darkness. Quentin and his companions fight for freedom, justice and righteousness. Lawhead plainly intends this conflict to portray spiritual warfare. Quentin's enemies find their support in the pagan religions who worship the old gods, and employ the powers of sorcery, the occult and the dark arts. In contrast, victory of Quentin's kingdom is possible only with the help of the Most High God. The Christian symbolism is clearly evident: the conflict between the powers of good and evil is a picture of the great spiritual battle of the ages between God and Satan. Readers familiar with the battle images of Ephesians 6 will find the connections obvious. Quentin in particular plays a M!essianic role, by achieving deliverance as the Priest King, fulfilling prophecy in a manner much like Jesus Christ. Yet in contrast to these Messianic overtones of Quentin's role in an epic struggle, Lawhead also humanizes Quentin to the point where he is like us, a soldier in the battle rather than the Deliverer. Lawhead makes profound observations about personal faith, by showing that in the battle Quentin must learn to trust in the Most High. The Most High will be faithful in preserving the Kingdom, but his soldiers must be faithful in trusting and obeying him.<br /><br />It is this depth of spiritual vision that makes Lawhead's prose all the more compelling and enjoyable. It is in the first place a story filled with medieval vistas and conflict - courageous knights in shining armour, flashing swords, evil wizards, deadly battles, heroic quests, and ancient chivalry. But especially the central place of the Most High God makes Lawhead's \\"Dragon King\\" trilogy so powerful and who!lesome - a picture of spiritual warfare, kings and kingdoms, prophets, dreams and visions, and above all faith in the Most High.

In the genre of the finely crafted English detective story, Chesterton's \\"Father Brown\\" stories are wholesome and stimulating detective tales surpassed by few others, except perhaps Doyle's legendary Sherlock Holmes.  In contrast to the arrogant Holmes, however, Chesterton's protagonist is rather quiet, unassuming and modest, and makes an unlikely hero - a catholic priest.  Father Brown's simple manner makes you quick to underestimate him, but the startling flashes of brilliance that spill from beneath his humble exterior soon make you realize that he has a firm grasp on the truth of a situation when you are as yet frustratingly distant from it.  His perceptive one-liners make it evident that he has a clear insight into something that you see only as an apparently insoluble paradox.<br />Chesterton has been called the \\"prince of paradox\\", and the Father Brown stories are a clear testimony of his fondness for paradox.  Ultimately it is not just crimes that Brown must solve, but the paradox underlying them.  In fact, not all stories are crime stories - among them are mysterious situations that do not involve criminals, and it is the perceptive insight of Father Brown that is needed make apparent contradictions comprehensible by his ruthless logic.  Father Brown is not so much concerned with preserving life or bringing a criminal to justice as he is with unravelling the strands of an impossible paradox.  In fact, Chesterton's conception of Father Brown is itself a paradox - both a cleric and a crime-fighter, a priest and a policeman, a representative of God's mercy and an instrument of God's justice, a proclaimer of forgiveness and a seeker of guilt, a listener in the confessional and a questioner in the interrogation.<br />How a priest could possibly play the role of a detective is explained in the first story, \\"The Blue Cross\\".  Brown apprehends the confounded criminal Flambeau and explains that his knowledge of the criminal mind is due in part to what he's heard at the confessional booth \\"We can't help being priests.  People come and tell us these things.\\" When Flambeau retorts \\"How in blazes do you know all these horrors?\\" Chesterton allows his humble priest to attribute his insight into human depravity to his experience as a priest: \\"Oh, by being a celibate simpleton, I suppose, he said.  Has it never struck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men's real sins is not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil.\\"<br />But both Chesterton and Father Brown have insight into much more than just human depravity - they are both champions of Catholic orthodoxy.  This gives the Father Brown stories a depth not found in Brown's compatriot Holmes.  In the course of Chesterton's stories, we are treated to philosophical discussions about catholic theology, such as the relationship between faith and reason.  We do not merely meet an assortment of cobblers, blacksmiths, magistrates and generals, but atheists, legalists, secularists, pagans, Presbyterians, Puritans, Protestants and Catholics, all with varying and vying affections for superstition, naturalism, rationalism, scepticism, agnosticism, materialism, anarchism, nihilism, or cynicism. Along with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, G.K. Chesterton was one of the few writers in the twentieth century that made an important contribution to English literature that was stamped by Christian principles instead of the prevailing secularism of the day.<br />Readers who do not share Chesterton's theological convictions will not concur with all his insights, but they must concede that they are enjoyable, profound and stimulating.  Somewhat surprising is the occasional use of blasphemous expletives such as \\"O my God\\", although generally from the mouths of others than Father Brown himself.  And Brown does seem to degenerate more and more into a mouthpiece for Chesterton, with a sermonizing tone not present in the first stories.<br />But on the whole these are exemplary models of the Englishcrime short story.  The Penguin edition contains all the stories from all five of Chesterton's published Father Brown collections.  Among my favorites are \\"The Blue Cross\\", where Father Brown follows a mysterious trail of clues and engages in some bizarre behaviour and fascinating theological discourse to apprehend Flambeau.  \\"The Hammer of God\\" is also an outstanding whodunnit, as Brown solves the murder of a man who has been crushed by a huge hammer outside a church, seemingly the recipient of a divine thunderbolt of judgment from heaven.  In the process Chesterton shares some thought-provoking insights, such as the memorable: \\"Humility is the mother of giants.  One sees great things from the valley; only small things from the peak.\\"  Also unforgettable is \\"The Blast of the Book\\", which recounts the mysterious disappearance of five men whose only crime was to open a seemingly magical book.  Father Brown is quick to unravel the paradox by explaining it as the work of an ingenious prankster.<br />Father Brown's tongue never fails to produce profound paradoxical gems such as \\"The point of the pin was that it was pointless.\\"  And: \\"I never should have thought he would be so illogical as to die in order to avoid death.\\"  It is Brown's unique perspective that allows him to see what others do not see.  When his compatriots are awed at the eloquence of a magistrate's thundering sermon in \\"the Mirror of the Magistrate\\", Father Brown remarks: \\"I think the thing that struck me most was how different men look in their wigs.  You talk about the prosecuting barrister being so tremendous.  But I happened to see him take his wig off for a minute, and he really looks quite a different man.  He's quite bald, for one thing.\\"<br />With the finely crafted prose, depth of theological insight, and brilliant combination of perception and paradox, Chesterton has created in Father Brown a noble and enduring character, a worthy successor to Sherlock Holmes and in some respects his equal and superior.  The Father Brown stories are unquestionably worthy of their designation as classics.crime short story.

US	51067904	R111PSG0YSO5TC	1576736792	39938678	Lord Foulgrin's Letters	Books	5	7	10	N	N	I hate this book.  Says the devil.	The devil must hate this book for the same reasons that I loved it, and that you should read it.  Unashamedly indebted to the premise of C.S. Lewis' \\"Screwtape Letters\\", \\"Lord Foulgrin's Letters\\" purports to be a collection of correspondence from the demon Lord Foulgrin to his understudy Squaltaint.  Squaltaint's mission is to target the unknowing Jordan Fletcher by ensnaring him with evil, and prevent him from serving the Enemy - God.  Fortunately for us, Alcorn has not just blindly emulated Lewis, but has added an innovation of his own.  Alongside the demonic letters is a story recounting the events in the life of Fletcher and his family, a story that is readable on its own.  Since Foulgrin's letters are very dense - as Alcorn might say, \\"the devil would convince us not to read them\\" - the independent story-line helps us along in sustaining interest.  It makes Alcorn's effort more accessible and relevant for modern readers than its famous Screwtape counterpart.<br />What Alcorn shares with Lewis, however, is the very thing that made the \\"Screwtape Letters\\" so popular and so powerful: a fascinating picture of the reality of spiritual warfare accompanied with a profound and insightful analysis of modern culture.  Alcorn's portrait of this battle is of course fictional, but spiritual warfare itself is a Biblical reality.  It is unfortunate that the content of the demonic letters does not always directly correspond with the accompanying plot description, and that Foulgrin's letters occasionally evolve into a hodgepodge of opinions on various matters, rather than structured expositions on a single theme.  But nonetheless it is especially these letters at the end of each chapter that make this book so valuable.  Alcorn's insights and analysis into today's world are sometimes shocking, but rarely are his criticisms misplaced.<br />This book is not like a great deal of other contemporary Christian fiction.  It is not meant to be.  Firstly, it's not easy to read.  Each section is in effect a mini-sermon, and it would be an excellent resource for group discussion. Secondly, it does not unrealistically present believers as shining saints.  Alcorn's characters are like us: they have sins, shortcomings and struggles, and yet they experience progress in the Christian life.  Thirdly, it's not light, fluffy and syrupy.  It's meant to open your eyes to the reality of spiritual warfare, the dangers of sin, and the responsibilities of the Christian in the modern world.  If you feel guilty at times, then it has succeeded.<br />Alcorn equips his readers for spiritual warfare by critically analyzing our secular world though the glasses of his fictional demon. Although he also takes shots at the modern church, theological liberalism, and cultic Mormonism, Alcorn's critical eye especially targets modern secularism.  In turn, he addresses the ills of our godless society: atheistic public education, secular colleges, abortion, pornography, and the occult.  He warns against the dangers of the internet, television, and movies. He identifies our world's warped perspectives on love, sex and marriage, money and possessions. He demonstrates the relevance of the ten commandments in today's world.  He encourages healthy habits for Christians, such as reading good Christian literature, maintaining regular devotions with Bible reading and prayer, and attending worship faithfully.  He subtly teaches Biblical truths about complex theological problems and apologetics, by defending the divinity of Christ, maintaining the doctrine of creation over against evolution, and answering questions about the problem of evil in the world and how a loving God can allow suffering.  Readers familiar with Alcorn's other writings on these subjects will recognize much they've read before.  But it's a truth that bears repeating.  Although what we have packaged in the end is Randy Alcorn's personal philosophy of life, it's essentially a Biblical philosophy.<br />Certainly there areexceptions - More attention could have been given to the work of the Holy Spirit in preserving true believers in the spiritual war.  But on the whole, Alcorn's theology is sound: he clearly states the bad news about human depravity and the default condition of sinful mankind as hell-bound, the good news of God's grace through Christ's atoning sacrifice, as well as the work of the Holy Spirit in working regeneration and preserving the saints.  Alcorn is in fact a four-point Calvinist, committed to total depravity, unconditional election, invincible grace, and the perseverance of the saints - the doctrine of limited atonement being the only Calvinistic arrow not in his quiver.<br />But alongside a sound theology, the premise of this novel also requires a sound demonology.  Alcorn himself concedes that he is somewhat speculative in this respect.  Although at times Alcorn became tiresome by unnecessarily spending too much time in describing the demons' hate for God rather than their deceptive wiles, his demonology was successful on the whole.  It did raise some questions nonetheless: Is it possible for demons to witness scenes in heaven if they have been cast from heaven (Rev. 12)? Do demons have no ability whatsoever to read human thoughts? To what extent can demons control events such as causing a car crash or \\"inflict certain maladies\\" as with the case of Job?  Alcorn has also struggled with these questions, and in the end a certain amount of speculation has to be accepted as a literary device and can hardly be avoided in a work of fiction.<br />But a somewhat speculative demonology doesn't undermine the truth of Alcorn's theology or the accuracy of his cultural critique.  And it is precisely this that makes Lord Foulgrin's Letters so brilliant.  It resonates with truth and conviction, and reminds us of the Biblical truth of Ephesians 6.  Life is a spiritual war in which we must not underestimate our enemy, put on the armor of God, and stand only in His strength. Alcorn concludes in his afterword \\"Know your God. Know yourself.  Know your enemy.  I pray Lord Foulgrin's Letters helps you better know each.\\" This book sure does.  That's the reason why the devil hates it, and you will love it.exceptions - More attention could have been given to the work of the Holy Spirit in preserving true believers in the spiritual war.

Washington Irving's (1783-1859) claim to fame is as a pioneer of American fiction, and he is widely recognized as the \\"father of American literature.\\"  The book that especially propelled him to fame was \\"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\\" which contained his two most famous fantasy stories - \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" - both of which are contained in this collection.<br />But it is not merely his ground-breaking efforts that garnered him literary recognition, because Irving's stories are at the same time characterized by charming and colourful prose befitting a skilled writer.  The two stories in this collection (the \\"Dover Thrift\\" edition) are his two most famous stories and are an excellent sampling of his craft.  It's not always easy reading - in fact these stories would be too dense even for most older children.  His vocabulary is extensive, and sentences structure verbose and lengthy - a style rather unlike that employed by contemporary writers.  But despite this, Irving demonstrates a wonderful command of the English language, and has the ability to create a vivid picture of his setting, characters and events.  Particularly delightful is the attention he devotes to describing his characters.  And yet his stories are far from mere character portraits - they are exciting and enchanting tales that make the reader eager to find out the outcome.<br />\\"Rip Van Winkle\\" has gained the status of a classic, and is familiar to most children, but likely few have read Irving's original.  It breathes an authenticity and air not found in the contemporary abridged versions of the story.  Irving presents his tale as the alleged discovered manuscript (complete with postscript) of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker.  The delightful story of Rip Van Winkle - who fell asleep in the Catskill mountains after drinking a mysterious brew acquired from some strange little men, and then awoke 20 years later - will continue to please readers old and new.  In the course of the story, Irving makes a profound social comment about the changes happening in his America.<br />\\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is renowned for its chilling tale of the Headless Horseman, and is a Halloween favorite.  Actually, however, it is much more than that.  It is not so much a spooky tale of a legendary village ghost as it is a colourful tale about two rival suitors.  Ichabod Crane is a simple school teacher who is in love with Katrina Van Tassel, and equally in love with the estates of her father, a wealthy Dutch farmer.  His counter-part is the powerful local hero Bram Bones, whose affections for Katrina mirror those of Ichabod Crane, and who is determined to put an end to the affections of underdog Crane by a mysterious and elaborate trickery.  As is evident also in his other stories, it is particularly fascinating how Irving exploits the supernatural superstitions of the popular mind to create a sense of mystery and fear, but himself gives a naturalist explanation that rises above such popular notions by explaining the supernatural with natural events.<br />Readers used to the easy diet of modern fiction will find the pioneering work of Washington Irving rather tough to chew on.  But those who delight in tasting words, biting on imaginative characters and settings, with a few sips of suspense and supernatural in the process, will discover that Washington Irving's stories are just the literary serving they are renowned to be: a classic. Irving won't please all children of the modern era. But children of literature who have acquired a fine literary taste will find that despite the heightened language of his time, Irving is still digestible and enjoyable.he course of the story, Irving makes a profound social comment about the changes happening in his America.<br />\\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is renowned for its chilling tale of the Headless Horseman, and is a Halloween favorite.

US	51067904	R2YR6YHZOOHM0P	0842339523	307340609	Mark of the Lion : A Voice in the Wind, An Echo in the Darkness, As Sure As the Dawn (Vol 1-3)	Books	4	10	12	N	N	An epic that faltered after a brilliant start.	Francine Rivers has made a name for herself with her enthralling three volume \\"Mark of the Lion\\" series.  Her story-telling abilities, colourful characterization, and expertise in describing real feelings are superb.  Unlike a great deal of contemporary fiction, the \\"Mark of the Lion\\" series is epic in scope and deep in content.  It's not just entertainment, it's literary fiction of a high calibre.  In each volume, Rivers addresses serious issues in the Christian life: witnessing to an unbelieving world, forgiveness and anger.<br />The first volume, \\"A Voice in the Wind\\" is easily the best.  With a deeply-moving story that entertains, educates and enthrals, Rivers has crafted a captivating tale of the Christian Jewess Hadassah that takes readers on a breath-taking ride from the ruins of Jerusalem, to the godless hub of first century Rome, and the Artemis worshipping city of Ephesus.  Particularly compelling is the touching manner in which Rivers portrays the special relationship between the slave Hadassah and her master Julia.  But especially outstanding is her portrayal of first century Rome.  The culture of the Roman empire is described in vivid detail, complete with its godless and decadent lifestyle, political intrigue and corruption, infatuation with gladiators and games, sex and sensuality.  The description of Rome's decadence is at times almost too vivid, and consequently the book is not really suitable for younger readers.  The inclusion of contemporary issues such as abortion, homosexuality, and common-law marriage at first seems anachronistic, but actually the decay evident in contemporary Western culture is merely a mirror image of the decay that also characterized and eventually destroyed corrupt Rome.<br />Over against the destructive decay of Roman culture, Rivers describes its counter-culture: Christianity.  The only hope for a people trapped in an immoral and disintegrating world - both then and now - is the Saviour and restorer of life: Jesus Christ.  Ultimately this age-old contrast between the church and the world is at the heart of this epic novel.  It's an incentive to be faithful Christians and live counter-culture in our equally corrupt times.  It is especially this quality that makes \\"A Voice in the Wind\\" not only immensely satisfying, but also incredibly stimulating for your own faith.<br />The voice of God in Hadassah's life echoes in the dark and empty lives of Marcus and Julia in volume two, \\"An Echo in the Darkness.\\"  In their lives Rivers creates a vivid and wonderful portrait of the truth of Ecclesiastes - the emptiness and vanity of a life where one pursues anything except God.  Just like today's world, Rome offers wealth, pleasure, power and knowledge.  Both Marcus and Julia discover that the pursuit of pleasure, work, money and sexuality eventually proves to be meaningless and empty - the same conclusion as Ecclesiastes.  But will they come to discover that meaning is found instead in God? Hadassah - now a miraculous healer beneath veils with scars that testify to the \\"mark of the lion\\" - proves to be instrumental in the resolution of their internal struggles, and in the end the lives of this three-some converge in a rather remarkable way.<br />The gladiator Atretes returns in the third volume, \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\", and Rivers chronicles his journey back to his Germanic homeland, accompanied by the Christian widow Rizpah, nursemaid to his son.  For Atretes, it proves to be much more than just a journey to his barbarian Chatti tribe, but especially a spiritual journey of faith.  The portrayal of spiritual conflict as the gospel is proclaimed in pagan territory is particularly convincing.  Rivers' description of demonic powers at work among the pagans under the guise of their gods is powerful and accurate.<br />The preoccupation with internal struggles makes both \\"An Echo in the Darkness\\" and \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" more introspective than \\"A Voice in the Wind\\".  Readers who enjoyed the excitement and action of Rome's bread and circuses in the first volume, will be disappointed to find that instead of battles between gladiators and lions in the arena, Rivers focuses more on the inner battles of the heart, as Marcus, Julia and Atretes search for peace and meaning in their lives. Displaying a remarkable ability to convey and describe human emotions, feelings and struggles, Rivers demonstrates that she is as skilful at portraying inner conflict as she is at portraying outer conflict.<br />However, the last two entries of the series are also subject to a questionable theological proposition.  Rivers sets her novels in an era when the church was established and God revealed Himself almost exclusively through apostles, prophets, and the written writings.  Yet despite this, she incorporates signs and wonders that were unique to the apostolic era (direct revelation, the gift of tongues, and miracles).  It is most unfortunate that these become decisive turning points in the lives of her characters.  Not only do these miracles and wonders result in an overly optimistic story-line that fails to reflect the harshness of real life for Christians today, they are dependent on a tenuous theological position that apostolic wonders and miracles did not cease with the apostolic era.  Other flaws also emerge, notably her presentation of love and forgiveness as a Christian duty independent of repentance, Hadassah's purity of character which belittles the reality of an ongoing sinful nature, and the extent to which romance overshadows religion in determining the course of events in Atretes' life.  The graphic allusions to Atretes' sexual relations outside of marriage and frank discussion of sexual thoughts certainly makes this series unsuitable for children.<br />\\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" does overcome some of the weaknesses of \\"An Echo in the Darkness\\", but not enough to match the brilliant start begun with \\"A Voice in the Wind.\\"  Not bothering to read the entire trilogy can be justified, but to not bother reading \\"A Voice in the Wind\\" is to miss one of the best efforts in contemporary Christian fiction!t and action of Rome's bread and circuses in the first volume, will be disappointed to find that instead of battles between gladiators and lions in the arena, Rivers focuses more on the inner battles of the heart, as Marcus, Julia and Atretes search for peace and meaning in their lives.

US	51067904	R3ERE88EPA6K7	0064471195	261336709	The Chronicles of Narnia Boxed Set	Books	5	20	28	N	N	A fantasy world about the real world: my analysis of Narnia	On the level of children, the Narnia Chronicles function as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure about children who are magically transported into the world of Narnia, a parallel world with fantastic creatures (fauns, giants, dwarves, and witches) and exciting events (battles, journeys, and voyages).  Each story functions independently, and features children from the real world who are faced with a quest to help the Narnians, a quest they complete with the vital involvement of the great Lion, Aslan.  The Harry Potter series - often regarded as a worthy successor of the Narnia series - is a success because it mirrored our real world.  But the Narnia tales are superior and successful for different reasons.  They are more demanding on the reader and more imaginative precisely because they doesn't mirror the real world.  And that is their strength.  Full of suspense, fantasy, excitement, and adventure, when assessed purely as an imaginative story for children, the Narnia Chronicles are worthy of the success they has enjoyed. <br />But when read on an adult level, the Narnia Chronicles function as a powerful medium used by Lewis to impart powerful spiritual truths about Christianity and theology.  Readers familiar with the Bible will especially find Biblical allusions numerous and recognizable.  In \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" there are allusions to Satan's deceptive schemes in promising mankind kingship over the world, as well as to the death and resurrection of Christ as a substitutionary atonement in saving sinners from Satan (p.165ff).  This cannot be regarded as a strict allegory, because otherwise one will be quick to point out its shortcomings (in Scripture it is God's justice, not Satan, that Christ must make a deal with).  \\"Prince Caspian\\" portrays spiritual warfare, showing the importance of our sufficiency being in Christ and not in ourselves (p.270).  It also demonstrates the folly of atheism and importance of living by faith andnot by sight, since God's invisible nature does not mean he does not exist (p.150).  \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" presents a vivid portrait of a sinner as a dragon that needs Christ to take off the scales of his old nature and dress him in the clothes of a new nature (p.155ff).  One of the highlights of the series, it depicts a journey to the end of time as a geographical journey to the end of the world, portraying time as a place.  \\"The Silver Chair\\" emphasizes the truth of Deuteronomy 6 that the signs of God's Word need to be carefully remembered and obeyed, no matter what the appearances (p.24-25).  Sin is clearly the fault of man (p.123), and the only solution is to drink from Christ the living water, for there is no other source of water apart from him (p.20-21).  \\"The Horse and the Boy\\" marvellously shows how by the providence of God, Christ is behind all the events of our life, even hurt and pain, working for good (p.175) - \\"It wasn't luck at all really, it was Him!\\" (p.180).  \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" reflects on the motifs of creation and fall, as evil enters a beautiful world where a man and his wife are king and queen (p.142).  And appropriately \\"The Last Battle\\" features an antichrist (donkey in a lion's skin) with its terrible result - \\"he had never dreamed that one of the results of an ape's setting up a false Aslan would be to stop people believing in the real one.\\" (p.92).  Complete with apocalyptic imagery of the sun going blood red (p.196), there is a final battle which ushers in eternal life, painted by Lewis in vivid colours.<br />The key to the whole series, however, is evident in \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", where Aslan says \\"This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there.\\"  About the real world, Aslan observes \\"There I have another name.  You must learn to know me by that name.\\" (p.270).  This is an apparent inconsistency in the Narnia Chronicles, because noneof the characters actually seem to know Christ in the real world - Eustace doesn't even know Adam and Eve (\\"The Silver Chair\\" p.40).  Yet it is clear that Lewis wants our understanding of Aslan in the world of Narnia to lead to a growing knowledge of Christ in the real world.  Like Christ, Alsan inspires, comforts, and guides.  Meeting Aslan evokes a sense of awe, fear and delight (\\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", p.86), because he is \\"both terrible and good\\" (p.140ff), paralleling the holiness and mercy of the only Saviour Jesus Christ.  In all the upheavals and conflicts of Narnia, there is one constant: Aslan.<br />In light of these profound spiritual truths underlying the story-line, one must be compelled to acknowledge the enduring significance of Lewis' achievement in the Narnia Chronicles, and agree that this series has rightfully garnered a status among the literary classics.  Even Lewis, however, has weaknesses.  Why the \\"good guys\\" needed to resort to occultic practices such as astrology and use of crystals was beyond me.  Moreover, the occasional use of expletives such as \\"Lor\\", \\"gosh\\" and \\"golly\\" (once even \\"Gawd\\") seemed to me a thinly-veiled form of blasphemy.  Particularly puzzling is the suggestion of a kind of limited universalism in \\"The Last Battle\\", as Aslan accepts the unbeliever Emeth's service to the false god Tash as service rendered to him (p.205).<br />But these are minor quibbles, not foundational criticisms.  Narnia may exist only in Lewis imagination and ours, but a journey there will not be without profit.  Lewis has given us a legacy that will not only entertain us with a sparkling and imaginative fantasy world, but will remind us of very real spiritual truths about Jesus Christ.  \\"All worlds draw to an end, except Aslan's own country\\" (\\"The Last Battle\\" p.111) and those who know Him will indeed live forever.	2001-07-04

If you are expecting something like Lawhead's profound and satisfying \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" when reading these books, prepare to be disappointed. This isn't typical Lawhead, it's the Lawhead \\"lite\\" version, because it lacks the depth of description, character and emotion present in many of Lawhead's other works. Undoubtedly, this is more entertainment than the literary fiction of those offerings. But it would be unfair to criticize Lawhead too harshly for this, because this series was born in the infancy of his career as a writer. Readers familiar with the more polished and developed Lawhead as evident in his later work would do the man an injustice by measuring his first work by the incredibly high standard of his more mature efforts.<br /><br />As a series geared towards the level of teens rather than adults, and where the reader is not under the false expectation that it contains the majesty and depth of the \\"Pendragon Cycle\\", this is still a great read. This first volume i!n the series of three (The \\"Dragon King\\" Trilogy) introduces us to young Quentin, an assistant in the temple of Ariel, who forsakes aspirations of priesthood in order to undertake an important mission for the King. This quickly leads to a quest to save King Eskevar from the hands of his evil brother Prince Jaspin who harbours selfish ambitions to take over the crown. Quentin and his great war horse Balder are soon joined in this quest by the religious hermit Durwin, the renowned outlaw Theido, and later by the prison warder Trenn, the good Queen Alinea, the mysterious nomad Toli, and the brave knight Ronsard. But Jaspin proves to be a mere pawn in the hands of the evil necromancer Nimrood, and it is from the clutches of this corrupt wizard that the King must be rescued. Quentin and company face perils of many kinds, including a long journey through the lands of Mensandor and Elsendor to the dreaded Karsh, the desolate home of Nimrood. They encounter the dreaded Harriers, and a! multitude of other dangers. The action rarely lets up, as the friends flee from one danger into the next.<br /><br />The battle lines between good and evil are clearly marked out, as a conflict ensues between the powers of light and darkness, good and evil. Lawhead plainly intends this conflict to portray spiritual warfare. On one side is Nimrood, with his powers of sorcery, occultic skills and dabbling with the dark arts. On the other side is young Quentin and his band of fellow fighters for freedom, justice and righteousness. Pagan religions worshipping \\"the old gods\\" are present - in fact Quentin serves such a god during his days at the temple. But these gods are presented as \\"shadows, faint mists tossed on the breeze and dispersed.\\" (p.174). A key turning point comes when Quentin meets \\"the Maker, the One, Most High God\\", and receives His blessing (p.173-7). The Christian symbolism being very clear, it is ultimately the Most High God who makes victory over against the forces !of darkness possible.<br /><br />In the end, the struggle between good and evil is somewhat simplistic, the victories a little too easily accomplished (the rescue from Nimrood's island a case in point), the Christian imagery rather thinly veiled, the characters rather two-dimensional, and fantasy world of Mensandor not breathtakingly vivid in description. But that's OK. If you like to read about medieval type settings with knights in shining armour, evil wizards, and heroic quests, you'll love this book. The action is fast and furious, the story line enjoyable, the message clear and positive. It's not deep, it's not profound, but Lawhead \\"Lite\\" is still an enjoyable read.dangers.

The Tales from the Arabian Nights are ancient stories of romance, suspense, mystery, magic and adventure originating from Persia, India and Arabia, originally functioning as the daily entertainment of ordinary people.  They are woven together under the premise that they saved the life of Shahrazad, a queen whose husband executed each of his new wives after one night of marriage.  By beginning an exciting story every evening, but withholding the ending, Shahrazad was able to convince the breathless king to spare her for another day until the next installment.  Of course, after 1001 nights of devious story-telling, she had saved her life forever.<br />First introduced to the Western world in the eighteenth century, these stories have attained great popularity, and been retold many times, with \\"Aladdin\\" even being made into a Disney film.  This collection features only a small selection of the best and most popular tales.  Unlike many editions, it doesn't reflect the contemporary versions of the stories, but seeks to be faithful to the authentic Arabic sources.  N.J. Dawood is well-equipped to retell these stories from the original Arabic.  Born in Baghdad, Dawood attained a reputation as a scholar and received a university education in London.  Amongst other projects he has translated \\"The Koran\\" and a complete collection of \\"Tales from the Thousand and One Nights.\\"<br />Because this version intends to be faithful to the original Arabic, readers should not expect a sanitized Western interpretation.  If you are looking for a fresh style that brings these stories to life for children in a modern Western audience, this is likely not the edition for you.  These stories are unashamedly Arabic in character, and the religious aspect (Islam) is dominant throughout, where health and wealth, wine and women are bestowed as the blessing of Allah for obedience.  But despite this, these stories continue to capture the Western imagination.  Expect to read stories about powerful genies (jinees), magical lamps, talking animals, distant voyages, and impossible adventures.<br />This volume (a companion to \\"Sinbad the Sailor and Other Tales from The Arabian Nights\\") contains the well-known stories of \\"Aladdin\\", and \\"The Ebony Horse\\".  Also represented are the lesser-known but equally fascinating \\"Khalifah the Fisherman\\" and \\"The Dream\\".

The evil necromancer Nimrood returns to collaborate with the defenders of the old gods - the priests at the temple of Ariel, who see the construction of the King's Temple as an inevitable sign of the destruction of their own High Temple. Suddenly, the peace of Quentin's kingdom becomes overshadowed by darkness. A close friend of Quentin is killed, his son kidnapped. Quentin must face open hostility from his enemies, and! even conflict from his own people, and treachery from his own supporters. But worst of all the flame of the sword goes out, and the hopes for the kingdom appear to be extinguished along with it: \\"One fell thrust and the fire of the white lanthanil blade had been quenched. The awful significance of what had happened struck him like a thunderbolt...the hand of the Most High was removed from him.\\" (p.77-8) Is there any hope for Quentin or his kingdom?<br /><br />The ensuing struggle makes this book the most emotional of the series. Certainly we are treated to lots of Lawhead excitement and action, one of the highlights being the intrigue and conflict of a castle under seige. But \\"The Sword and the Flame\\" doesn't quite have the same blazing glory of battle as the previous volume. It is far more introspective, as it focuses on Quentin's loneliness, his deep, dark and total despair, which nearly extinguishes his faith. \\"Now there was only darkness. In the space of half a day he had los!t his son, his trusted friend, and - worst of all - the favor of the Most High. His mind reeled at the enormity of his trouble, his heart ached with sorrow, his body throbbed with grief and exhaustion.\\" (p.85) Lawhead treats this subject with raw and gripping emotion, precisely the ability later developed and fine tuned which made the \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" so powerful. Perhaps even more compelling than the glory of a kingdom, is the tragedy of a fallen king, who is so distraught that he rejects the Most High (p.166) and tumbles into the depths of despair.<br /><br />Yet this personal struggle of the king occurs in the context of a great struggle for his kingdom. Does the extinguished flame of the enchanted sword mean that the Most High no longer is to be trusted? The people of the kingdom are convinced that the old gods are humbling their king for having chased after a new god (p.159). Yet in the end, even when the people are ready to lose faith in the Most High, the Most High is fait!hful. \\"It is not the One who forgets us, but we forget him.\\" (p.199) Quentin must realize that \\"the flame of true faith can not be kindled on the fuel of the old religion.\\" (p.230) When he renews his faith, the tide turns. The climax of the book is particularly powerful, with scenes reminiscent of the confrontation on Mount Carmel between Elijah the prophet of the Most High and the prophets of Baal.<br /><br />In many respects, Lawhead's medieval fantasy world is reminiscent of Tolkien's world, although Tolkien's many fantastic creatures are absent. But what is absent in Tolkien is present in Lawhead: the Most High God. It is the strong spiritual vision where the Most High God and faith in God is central that makes Lawhead's books so powerful and so wholesome. Lawhead's \\"Dragon King\\" Trilogy paints a picture of spiritual warfare, kings and kingdoms, prophets, dreams and visions, and above all faith in the Most High. It's the picture of a time much like the glorious Old Testament !days of David and Solomon, who with prophets and visionaries fought for the peace of the Kingdom of the Most High in the era before the coming of Christ. Although not as deep or profound as \\"The Pendragon Cycle\\", this series of Lawhead \\"Lite\\" is still unquestionably a success.n, who with prophets and visionaries fought for the peace of the Kingdom of the Most High in the era before the coming of Christ.

In volume two of the series, Quentin has matured into a young adult and made his home and studies in Dekra, far away from his beloved Bria. Along with his companion and friend Toli, Quentin heads back to the royal castle at Askelon at the urgent summons of King Eskevar, who detects an impending danger that threatens the empire. All the signs, including the bizarre and ever-brightening Wolf Star, point to a perilous time.<br /><br />The danger proves to be a serious one indeed: Nin the Destroyer, with his four warlords, and thousands of soldiers. Quentin and Toli escape from the clutches of one of the warlords along with the defector Myrmior, who turns out to be a most helpful ally. Myrmior's cunning and clever strategy does a great deal to slow the ad!vance of the army of Nin, which threatens to overwhelm Askelon. But in the end, victory depends on the fulfilment of an archaic prophecy about a Priest King, who will bring deliverance armed with a mysterious sword known as the \\"Zhaligheer\\" or \\"Shining One\\". It seems the Quentin is the fabled Priest King, and in obedience to the prophecy, he undertakes a mission to the lost mines of Ariga, along with the armorer Inchkeith, to search for the rare and fabled lanthanil needed to make the sword. Will he accomplish his mission on time? Is he the one of whom the prophecy speaks who will deliver Askelon from its fearsome foes?<br /><br />\\"The Warlords of Nin\\" is a separate story from \\"In the Hall of the Dragon King\\", with Quentin, his companions, and his country being the continuous element. The story is filled with breath-taking scenery and medieval conflict. Courageous knights in shining armour, flashing swords, deadly battles, ancient chivalry - it's all here. The conflict between the! powers of good and evil is in the end a picture of the great spiritual battle of the ages between the powers of light and darkness, God and Satan. Readers familiar with the battle images used by the apostle Paul in Ephesians 6, will find the connections obvious. The fight for truth, justice, righteousness and good is in many ways portrays the great struggle against evil in world history. The use and tacit endorsement of astrology, oracles, dreams and prophecy in this struggle is somewhat surprising, but could be explained as being reflecting a pre-Christian era, not unlike the time of the Old Testament before the coming of the Messiah. And so it is appropriate that deliverance comes though the fulfilment of prophecies about a Messianic Priest King. Readers familiar with the Bible will find the notion of a Messianic prophecy about a Priest King most recognizable, because this was precisely the case with Jesus Christ. To say that Quentin is Christ-like is to say too much, yet t!o deny the allusions to Christ's victory for His people is to deny the obvious.<br /><br />Yet in contrast to the Messianic overtones of Quentin's role in an epic struggle, Lawhead also humanizes Quentin to the point where he is like us, the soldiers in the battle rather than their Deliverer. In the process, Lawhead makes profound observations about personal faith. In the battle, Quentin must learn to trust in the Most High, and be confident that the Most High has plans for him, even when the way is unclear. In total trust, Quentin \\"should go along with this strange business regardless of my own feelings about it.\\" Says Durwin: \\"We must not fear for the Most High; he can take care of himself. We must only look to ourselves that we remain faithful to his call.\\" He concludes with an exhortation to faith that applies also to believers in the spiritual war of today: \\"But if you go beyond your fears and doubts, and follow anyway --ah! strange and wonderful things can happen. Yes, orph!ans can become kings, swordscan sprout flames and great enemies can be laid low at a stroke.\\" (p.282-3)<br /><br />It is this depth of spiritual vision that makes Lawhead's prose all the more compelling and enjoyable. Although essentially a story, it's a story with the power to impart enduring spiritual truths. No, maybe not to the extent of Lawhead's phenomenal achievement in the \\"Pendragon Cycle\\". But that doesn't make this book any less enjoyable, or any less of an achievement.can sprout flames and great enemies can be laid low at a stroke.\\" (p.282-3)<br /><br />It is this depth of spiritual vision that makes Lawhead's prose all the more compelling and enjoyable.

The Tales from the Arabian Nights are ancient stories of romance, suspense, mystery, magic and adventure originating from Persia, India and Arabia, originally functioning as the daily entertainment of ordinary people.  They are woven together under the premise that they saved the life of Shahrazad, a queen whose husband executed each of his new wives after one night of marriage.  By beginning an exciting story every evening, but withholding the ending, Shahrazad was able to convince the breathless king to spare her for another day until the next installment.  Of course, after 1001 nights of devious story-telling, she had saved her life forever.<br />First introduced to the Western world in the eighteenth century, these stories have attained great popularity, and been retold many times, with \\"Aladdin\\" even being made into a Disney film.  This collection features only a small selection of the best and most popular tales.  Unlike many editions, it doesn't reflect the contemporary versions of the stories, but seeks to be faithful to the authentic Arabic sources.  N.J. Dawood is well-equipped to retell these stories from the original Arabic.  Born in Baghdad, Dawood attained a reputation as a scholar and received a university education in London.  Amongst other projects he has translated \\"The Koran\\" and a complete collection of \\"Tales from the Thousand and One Nights.\\"<br />Because this version intends to be faithful to the original Arabic, readers should not expect a sanitized Western interpretation.  If you are looking for a fresh style that brings these stories to life for children in a modern Western audience, this is likely not the edition for you.  These stories are unashamedly Arabic in character, and the religious aspect (Islam) is dominant throughout, where health and wealth, wine and women are bestowed as the blessing of Allah for obedience.  But despite this, these stories continue to capture the Western imagination.  Expect to read stories about powerful genies (jinees), magical lamps, talking animals, distant voyages, and impossible adventures.<br />This volume (a companion to \\"Aladdin and Other Tales from The Arabian Nights\\") contains the well-known stories of the seven voyages of \\"Sinbad the Sailor\\", and \\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\\".  Also represented are the lesser-known but equally fascinating \\"Tale of the Hunchback\\" and \\"The Barber of Baghdad\\".

In the genre of the finely crafted English detective story, Chesterton's \\"Father Brown\\" stories are wholesome and stimulating detective tales surpassed by few others, except perhaps Doyle's legendary Sherlock Holmes.  In contrast to the arrogant Holmes, however, Chesterton's protagonist is rather quiet, unassuming and modest, and makes an unlikely hero - a catholic priest.  Father Brown's simple manner makes you quick to underestimate him, but the startling flashes of brilliance that spill from beneath his humble exterior soon make you realize that he has a firm grasp on the truth of a situation when you are as yet frustratingly distant from it.  His perceptive one-liners make it evident that he has a clear insight into something that you see only as an apparently insoluble paradox.<br />Chesterton has been called the \\"prince of paradox\\", and the Father Brown stories are a clear testimony of his fondness for paradox.  Ultimately it is not just crimes that Brown must solve, but the paradox underlying them.  In fact, not all stories are crime stories - among them are mysterious situations that do not involve criminals, and it is the perceptive insight of Father Brown that is needed make apparent contradictions comprehensible by his ruthless logic.  Father Brown is not so much concerned with preserving life or bringing a criminal to justice as he is with unravelling the strands of an impossible paradox.  In fact, Chesterton's conception of Father Brown is itself a paradox - both a cleric and a crime-fighter, a priest and a policeman, a representative of God's mercy and an instrument of God's justice, a proclaimer of forgiveness and a seeker of guilt, a listener in the confessional and a questioner in the interrogation.<br />How a priest could possibly play the role of a detective is explained in the first story, \\"The Blue Cross\\".  Brown apprehends the confounded criminal Flambeau and explains that his knowledge of the criminal mind is due in part to what he's heard at the confessional booth \\"We can't help being priests.  People come and tell us these things.\\" (p.17)  When Flambeau retorts \\"How in blazes do you know all these horrors?\\" Chesterton allows his humble priest to attribute his insight into human depravity to his experience as a priest: \\"Oh, by being a celibate simpleton, I suppose, he said.  Has it never struck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men's real sins is not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil.\\" (p.18)<br />But both Chesterton and Father Brown have insight into much more than just human depravity - they are both champions of Catholic orthodoxy.  This gives the Father Brown stories a depth not found in Brown's compatriot Holmes.  In the course of Chesterton's stories, we are treated to philosophical discussions about catholic theology, such as the relationship between faith and reason.  We do not merely meet an assortment of cobblers, blacksmiths, magistrates and generals, but atheists, legalists, secularists, pagans, Presbyterians, Puritans, Protestants and Catholics, all with varying and vying affections for superstition, naturalism, rationalism, scepticism, agnosticism, materialism, anarchism, nihilism, or cynicism. Along with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, G.K. Chesterton was one of the few writers in the twentieth century that made an important contribution to English literature that was stamped by Christian principles instead of the prevailing secularism of the day.<br />Readers who do not share Chesterton's theological convictions will not concur with all his insights, but they must concede that they are enjoyable, profound and stimulating.  Somewhat surprising is the occasional use of blasphemous expletives such as \\"O my God\\", although generally from the mouths of others than Father Brown himself.  And Brown does seem to degenerate more and more into a mouthpiece for Chesterton, with a sermonizing tone not present in the first stories.<br />But on the whole these are exemplary modelsof the English crime short story.  The \\"Wordsworth Classics\\" edition contains a selection of 18 favorite stories, with contributions from all five of Chesterton's published Father Brown collections.  Among my favorites are \\"The Blue Cross\\", where Father Brown follows a mysterious trail of clues and engages in some bizarre behaviour and fascinating theological discourse to apprehend Flambeau.  \\"The Hammer of God\\" is also an outstanding whodunnit, as Brown solves the murder of a man who has been crushed by a huge hammer outside a church, seemingly the recipient of a divine thunderbolt of judgment from heaven.  In the process Chesterton shares some thought-provoking insights, such as the memorable: \\"Humility is the mother of giants.  One sees great things from the valley; only small things from the peak.\\" (p.91)  Also unforgettable is \\"The Blast of the Book\\", which recounts the mysterious disappearance of five men whose only crime was to open a seemingly magical book.  Father Brown is quick to unravel the paradox by explaining it as the work of an ingenious prankster.<br />Father Brown's tongue never fails to produce profound paradoxical gems such as \\"The point of the pin was that it was pointless.\\" (p.273).  And: \\"I never should have thought he would be so illogical as to die in order to avoid death.\\" (p.264)  It is Brown's unique perspective that allows him to see what others do not see.  When his compatriots are awed at the eloquence of a magistrate's thundering sermon in \\"the Mirror of the Magistrate\\", Father Brown remarks: \\"I think the thing that struck me most was how different men look in their wigs.  You talk about the prosecuting barrister being so tremendous.  But I happened to see him take his wig off for a minute, and he really looks quite a different man.  He's quite bald, for one thing.\\" (p.222.)  His words are frequently indicative of remarkable perception.<br />With the finely crafted prose, depth of theological insight, and brilliant combination of perception and paradox, Chesterton has created in Father Brown a noble and enduring character, a worthy successor to Sherlock Holmes and in some respects his equal and superior.  The Father Brown stories are unquestionably worthy of their designation as classics.of the English crime short story.

Washington Irving's (1783-1859) claim to fame is as a pioneer of American fiction, and he is widely recognized as the \\"father of American literature.\\"  The book that especially propelled him to fame was \\"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\\" which contained his two most famous fantasy stories - \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" - both of which are contained in this collection.<br />But it is not merely his ground-breaking efforts that garnered him literary recognition, because Irving's stories are at the same time characterized by charming and colourful prose befitting a skilled writer.  The stories in this collection (the \\"Puffin Classics\\" series) are an excellent sampling of his craft.  It's not always easy reading - in fact many of these stories would be too dense even for older children.  His vocabulary is extensive, and sentences structure verbose and lengthy - a style rather unlike that employed by contemporary writers.  But despite this, Irving demonstrates a wonderful command of the English language, and has the ability to create a vivid picture of his setting, characters and events.  Particularly delightful is the attention he devotes to describing his characters.  And yet his stories are far from mere character portraits - they are exciting and enchanting tales that make the reader eager to find out the outcome.<br />\\"Rip Van Winkle\\" has gained the status of a classic, and is familiar to most children, but likely few have read Irving's original.  It breathes an authenticity and air not found in the contemporary abridged versions of the story.  Irving presents his tale as the alleged discovered manuscript (complete with postscript) of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker.  The delightful story of Rip Van Winkle - who fell asleep in the Catskill mountains after drinking a mysterious brew acquired from some strange little men, and then awoke 20 years later - will continue to please readers old and new.  In the course of the story, Irving makes a profound social comment about the changes happening in his America.  \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is renowned for its chilling tale of the Headless Horseman, and is a Halloween favorite.  Actually, however, it is much more than that.  It is not so much a spooky tale of a legendary village ghost as it is a colourful tale about two rival suitors.  Ichabod Crane is a simple school teacher who is in love with Katrina Van Tassel, and equally in love with the estates of her father, a wealthy Dutch farmer.  His counter-part is the powerful local hero Bram Bones, whose affections for Katrina mirror those of Ichabod Crane, and who is determined to put an end to the affections of underdog Crane by a mysterious and elaborate trickery.  As is evident also in his other stories, it is particularly fascinating how Irving exploits the supernatural superstitions of the popular mind to create a sense of mystery and fear, but himself gives a naturalist explanation that rises above such popular notions by explaining the supernatural with natural events.<br />Though lesser known, the other three stories in the \\"Puffin Classics\\" collection are equally enjoyable.  \\"The Spectre Bridegroom\\" is one of the most fascinating tales in the collection.  A young man is mistaken for a bridegroom and received into the castle of a wealthy baron as the husband of the baron's daughter.  But before the marriage can be consummated, the bridegroom dashes off, and the baron's family hears shortly afterwards that he's been killed.  But then who appears again except the bridegroom - or is it his ghost? - to steal his bride and vanish once more!  In the end, it is a satisfying tale more of brilliant scheming than of ghosts - although the fearful superstitions of the general public about the supernatural play an important role in the effective execution of these schemes. \\"The Pride of the Village\\" is the tragic tale of a young lady whose heart pines in love for an army officer who has deserted her, only todie at his feet when he returns.  \\"Mountjoy\\" is a wonderful study of an apparently incurable romantic, described by Irving as a \\"Castle-Builder\\".  When Mr. Mountjoy discovers a delicate footprint on a sandy shore, his passion for metaphysics, creativity and romance leads him to dream up an imaginary beautiful young maiden, and he promptly fall passionately in love with the nymph of his dreams.  The air castle he builds and its accompanying romanticism is crushed numerous times, even drowned, but each time is renewed and revived, just when it seems that \\"the cobweb romance I had been spinning\\" would be demolished completely.  In the end Mr. Mountjoy meets the girl of his dreams, only to discover that his air castles need to be reshaped once more, and in the end, destroyed completely.<br />Readers used to the easy diet of modern fiction will find the pioneering work of Washington Irving rather tough to chew on.  But those who delight in tasting words, biting on imaginative characters and settings, with a few sips of suspense and supernatural in the process, will discover that Washington Irving's stories are just the literary serving they are renowned to be: a classic. Irving won't please all children of the modern era. But children of literature who have acquired a fine literary taste will find that despite the heightened language of his time, Irving is still digestible and enjoyable.die at his feet when he returns.  \\"Mountjoy\\" is a wonderful study of an apparently incurable romantic, described by Irving as a \\"Castle-Builder\\".

Of course you already know the story of Pinocchio, right?  Who doesn't?  Millions have been charmed by the story of the naughty puppet that wanted to become a real boy.  His adventures are hardly new, as Pinocchio is in turn carved by Geppetto, rebellious against his father, disobedient to the good fairy, victimized at the hands of the deceitful cat and fox, changed into a donkey, rescued with his father in the whale, and eventually becomes a Real Boy.<br />But have you read the Original Pinocchio?  Most people do not know that there are two versions of Pinocchio.  One is the simplified version that Disney has given us, the version most people are familiar with.  The other is The Real Thing, The Original.  Along-side The Real Thing, the simplified Disney version is like Pinocchio the puppet - charming, but wooden and simple.  The Real Thing, however, is like Pinocchio the real boy - charming, and full of life.  This edition by Carlo Collodi is that Real Thing.<br />Although story of Pinocchio is a tale known to nearly every speaking child, it was first written in Italian.  Written by Carlo Lorenzini under the pseudonym Carlo Collodi, it dates back to 1883, when it was serialized in a newspaper and then published as a book with huge success.  The 1892 English version was equally well received, but it was the 1940 Walt Disney cartoon that gave Pinocchio the legendary status it enjoys today.  Only one problem: Disney took short cuts.  Collodi's original story has a richness and charm unmatched by Disney.  Collodi's Pinocchio is not about a loveable puppet, but about a bratty puppet who needs to learn an important moral lesson about responsibility.  And it resonates with slapstick humour that even Disney cannot equal.<br />Take the first paragraph: \\"There was once upon a time ... A king! My little readers will shout together.  No, children, you make a mistake.  Once upon a time there was a piece of wood.\\"  Collodi goes on to relate how this piece of wood is first owned by a carpenter called Mr. Antonio Cherry.  When his friend Mr. Geppetto comes to visit, the wood causes a great fight between the two friends by talking and calling Geppetto his hated nickname of Polendina. Geppetto is convinced it is Antonio who is doing the name-calling: \\"They seized one another's wigs, and even hit and bit and scratched each other.  At the end of the fight Geppetto's yellow wig was in Mr Antonio's hands, and the carpenter's grey wig between Geppetto's teeth.  `Give me my wig!' said Mr Antonio.  `You give me mine, and let us make a peace treaty!'  So the two little old men, each taking his own wig, shook hands, and promised to be good friends forever.\\"  But moments later, the fighting and name calling resumes (\\"Blockhead!\\" \\"Donkey!\\" \\"Ugly monkey!\\".  When peace is restored, with honours even, \\"they shook hands again, and vowed to be good friends for ever.  Then Geppetto took the piece of wood and, thanking Mr Antonio, went limping home.\\"  And so that's how Geppetto ends up with the wood that later became Pinocchio.<br />This is just a small taste of the sparkling and rich humour that is largely absent from most contemporary renditions of this famous tale.  Taking their cue from Disney, most modern stories have retained Collodi's story-line, but lost the delightful humour.  The Original is darker in tone than the simplified version (assassins try to murder Pinocchio and leave him swinging from a tree, and Pinocchio's threatened punishment of death for failing to take his medicine is announced by the appearance of rabbit undertakers) , but also has a wealth more action, excitement, and humour.  As long as you're only familiar with the simplified version of Pinocchio, you'll think of Pinocchio as a wooden and old story for little kids.  But anyone who is familiar with The Real Thing, The Original by Carlo Collodi, knows that just like Pinocchio himself, the Real Pinocchio story is in the end no wooden puppet, but a living and breathing classic.by a carpenter called Mr. Antonio Cherry.

But anyone who is familiar with The Real Thing, The Original by Carlo Collodi, knows that just like Pinocchio himself, the Real Pinocchio story is in the end no wooden puppet, but a living and breathing classic.	2001-07-03

Published in the UK under the title \\"The Final Boundary\\" and in North America under the title \\"The Visit\\", this offering from Adrian Plass is a collection of nine short stories he calls \\"modern parables\\".  Adrian Plass has garnered quite a reputation in Great Britain for his best-selling books, chiefly marked by their inspirational nature, and high humour.  This collection of stories is marked more by their serious tone than by their humour.  The lengthiest story - \\"The Visit\\" - was in fact born while Plass was struggling with an illness in 1984, and the rest of the stories, says Plass, \\"are parts of my shadow.\\"<br />One doesn't have to read very far to discover that Plass has a unique style of prose and story-telling that is far superior to most contemporary Christian writers.  It's captivating, colourful, and convincing.  What's more, there's nothing \\"light\\" about these stories.  Taking his cue from Christ's parables, Plass states that \\"a parable is a story that entertains at the front door while the truth slips through a side window.\\"  By means of his parables, Plass aims to give us more than an entertaining read, but to impart important truths about the Christian faith in the guise of fictional stories: \\"Each one embodies a truth about living in this complex world, and each has been a hard learned lesson for me.\\"<br />In some cases the \\"truth\\" and \\"lesson\\" is clearly discernible.  Under the guise of a story about climbing Mt. Snowden \\"A Letter to William\\" presents a clear warning about calling yourself a Christian but failing to obey Christ, being a hearer but not a doer of the Word.  \\"The Second Pint\\" features a character who is convinced he is only half-hearted in love for the church, but fully devoted in his love for the world, but is in for a shock when the world rejects him and he is cast into the outer darkness.  It is a cleverly reversed warning that those who are convinced that they are only half-hearted in love for the world but fully devoted in their love for the church will find themselves subject to the same fate.  \\"Small World\\" demonstrates that unlike earthly fathers who forsake their sons, heavenly Father will never forsake His adopted sons, because He already has forsaken His only begotten Son for their sake.  And \\"The Final Boundary\\" is a treat for cricket fans, since it uses the joys and failures of a final innings in a cricket match to mirror the joys and failures of the Christian life, and illustrate how Christ redeems us from our greatest failures and brings us into eternal glory.  The problem with most of the stories, however, is that the truth that Plass aims to impart is far from self-evident, and sometimes rather too hidden.  \\"Nearly Cranfield\\" is a sensitive and understanding psychological picture of how a child copes with grief after the death of his grandmother, and how his family fails to understand him, but what really is the point?  And is the message of the morbid \\"Why it Was All Right to Kill Uncle Reginald\\" a warning about judging hypocritically, since the writer who condemns his uncle for his abnormality in the end proves to have abnormal traits of his own?  Is \\"Bethel\\" making a point about the power of forgiveness?  I really don't know, and it would have been nice if Plass had told us.<br />In many cases I was left pondering after reading a story with the thought: \\"That was most enjoyable and there was definitely something profound behind that, but I haven't a clue what it was.\\"  Is it then the reader that has failed, or the author?  It would seem to me that in writing his own modern parables, Plass appears to have forgotten a key aspect of the parables he seeks to emulate - Jesus explained them to his disciples and made the meaning clear for them.  It's unfortunate that Plass doesn't do the same for us, because in many cases we are left like some of the crowds in the time of Jesus - hearing, but not understanding.<br />\\"The Visit\\" - an account of a visit of Jesus to a present day church- is the longest but most problematic story of them all.  Sadly, I found it disrespectful and blasphemous, because it fails to take into account the uniqueness of Christ's earthly ministry as a once-only time of humiliation and suffering.  Not only does Plass over-emphasize Christ's humanity at the expense of his divinity, but he does not do justice to the fact that Christ's mission was unrepeatable.  The point of the parable is to warn against having a fictional Jesus that is different than the real one, but by creating a fictional Jesus, Plass falls into the very trap he warns against - for who is to say that Plass' Jesus is like the real one?  It's shaky ground indeed.<br />But that's not to say that these stories cannot be read without profit.  Some of them are gems, and all of them exhibit superb literary qualities.  I recommend these stories - with reservations - for the thoughtful Christian reader who wants to read for profit and not merely for pleasure, and who is capable of careful discernment.- is the longest but most problematic story of them all.

This was my first foray into the genre of Christian historical romance.  I must confess that I wasn't expecting much.  What do you expect from an author who has filled bookshelves with titles like \\"Love Comes Softly\\" and \\"Love's Enduring Promise\\"?  Rightly or wrongly, I was expecting a sappy secular type romance with a superficial Christian sugar coating.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br />Not surprised about the romance.  In fact the romance is a key aspect of the plot.  Most of the suspense revolves around the romantic developments in the relationship between Ariana and Laramie.  Ariana is a young Christian girl who is orphaned by an Indian raid, leaving no connection with her birth parents aside from a wedding dress inherited from her mother.  But the likelihood of her ever wearing this dress becomes remote when she is kidnapped by a bunch of Wild West outlaws (oh yes, be prepared to read dialogue in the language of the old West!)  Laramie is the son of the gang's boss, and is commissioned to guard Ariana.  Laramie's father is concerned that his son doesn't have the makings of a true outlaw because he shoots only to wound, and is convinced that Laramie will learn to shoot to kill when he is forced to fight over a woman - Ariana (p.24-27).  But the anticipated showdown (p.125) doesn't eventuate, because Laramie decides to spirit Ariana off to freedom instead.  The reader is left to beg the burning question: how will the relationship between Laramie and Arian develop, and what will be the consequences?  And just when the outcome appears to be clear, a sudden twist in the plot unravels a surprise by launching the story in an entirely different direction, not just once, but twice!<br />But even though plot hinges on romance, the romantic element never becomes offensive or unbearable.  Here I was surprised.  Oke's treatment of the love relationship is markedly different from the way secular writers and even some Christian writers deal with romance.  Thankfully, we are spared graphic details about impossibly good looks, sickening physical attraction and burning passion.  This romance is definitely Christian: loving, but sober.<br />In fact, the whole intention of Oke with this book is to convey a solidly Christian message.  As she states in the preface, her aim is \\"to honestly present the ruthless mind-set of the outlaws ... as to show the hopelessness and helplessness of those who choose to live without law - without compassion - without God.\\" (p.8).  In this sense, Oke certainly portrays that the pioneer Wild West was not all romance, but that it was inhabited by wild characters who recognized only destructive emotions.  \\"Hate - bitterness.  Envy and greed.  Those were the passions he had grown up with.\\" (p.173).  Oke effectively shows the destructive effect of such sin and lawlessness - \\"The whole camp was like a powder keg - about to explode.  Given time they would all destroy one another - and the girl too.\\" (p.124)  But Oke also shows that redemption from such a destructive lifestyle is possible - through Jesus Christ.  The change experienced by her characters is one that can also be experienced by her readers in the same way - by the power of the gospel of Christ.<br />Weaknesses?  Maybe a few.  Oke appears to present Laramie as a pure victim of circumstances, and I wondered whether she is rather too optimistic about sinful human nature (p.185,196).  Furthermore, towards the end of the book, Oke presents it as a duty for a Christian to right his wrongs, and thus sends Laramie off to apologize to his father and beg his forgiveness (p.202-4).  The theology is correct, but the application is incorrect - it plainly contradicts the first part of the book, where Oke presents Laramie's plan to free Ariana as an obvious \\"right\\", not as a \\"wrong.\\"  If it was right, surely no apology was necessary!<br />But these minor ripples aside, this is an enjoyable book, full of surprises.  Before reading this book, I didn't think the Christianhistorical romance genre had much to offer.  Oke has shown me otherwise.  No it's not literary fiction like Frank Peretti, Francine Rivers, or Randy Alcorn, where the theology carries the plot. This is primarily entertainment fiction, where the plot carries itself.  But as such it is a successful execution, and a good read.  And as a bonus, the theology that does accompany the plot is warm, upbuilding, and not superficial or unnatural.

US	51067904	R30QC94VFDNUQU	0061057541	18473604	Byzantium	Books	5	7	8	N	N	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?	Unlike his remarkable and profound \\"Pendragon Cycle\\", \\"Byzantium\\" is not another Lawhead fantasy work.  Apart from a couple of instances of dreams and omens, it is rather an entry by Lawhead into a different genre: historical fiction.  Make that: EPIC historical fiction!  In paperback, \\"Byzantium\\" comes close to 900 pages of delightful reading!<br />Set in the tenth century Byzantine empire, the novel traces the life and adventures of a young Irish monk, Aidan.  Aidan is selected to join a special envoy on a voyage to Byzantium, and deliver a precious gift - the holy Book of Kells - to the Christian emperor.  The journey is an epic one, as Aidan becomes in turn a monk in the solitude of an Irish monastery, a slave of the barbarian Vikings, an ambassador and spy at the forefront of Byzantine political intrigue, a slave in the Caliph's silver mines, a serviceman of a Moslem Saracen prince, and finally again an Irish monk.  He becomes a man of many resources - a monk, a sailor, a slave, a warrior, a spy.<br />In many respects \\"Byzantium\\" is strongly reminiscent of \\"The Walking Drum\\", widely regarded as best work produced by the legendary Louis L'Amour.  Like \\"The Walking Drum\\", \\"Byzantium\\" is a historical epic of extraordinary magnitude and scope, a grand tour of European life in the Dark Ages which encompasses the ends of a complete empire, a multitude of richly detailed cultures, a tapestry of languages and a complex fabric of religions.  Like its L'Amour counterpart, \\"Byzantium\\" features a man who must overcome the odds in a variety of exceedingly harsh circumstances, and spices the tale of this adventurer with a glorious sense of adventure, romance, suspense, history, politics, and religion.<br />My only quibble with Lawhead's effort is an apparent historical inaccuracy: he presents the emperor in Byzantine as emperor of the entire Roman empire, despite the fact that historically at this time the empire was split into East and West, the Irish acknowledging the Western emperor not the Eastern one.  But on the whole Lawhead has surpassed L'Amour's historical masterpiece.  \\"The Walking Drum\\" is at best educational entertainment, whereas \\"Byzantium\\" is literature.  This is true literary fiction with well-rounded characters and a strong message.  Although like \\"The Walking Drum\\" the majority of \\"Byzantium\\" is absorbed with a heightened sense of adventure, Lawhead's monk is in the end proves to be markedly superior to L'Amour's one-dimensional superman. Aidan's journey proves to be much more than just a journey of perilous adventures, it is above all a personal journey of faith.  The monk who returns from his adventures is a changed man.<br />Having begun his journey as a devout Christian, Aidan's rapid change of fortunes and bitter taste of suffering lead him to reject his faith.  He becomes first agnostic, then atheistic, even Moslem.  Convinced that God has forsaken him, Aidan forsakes his faith and his God.  It is only after he returns home that he is spurred by his former barbarian friend Gunnar to re-examine his faith (p.861-8).  Re-evaluating his whole perspective on his pilgrimage, he comes to the recognition that even in his suffering God had not forsaken him.  It would be impossible, because Christ was forsaken in the place of the believers, hanging on the cross saying \\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\\"  Aidan comes to the startling realization that Christ's forsakenness means that believers will never be forsaken by God.  God has not forsaken Aidan, but Aidan has forsaken God.  Being a Christian does not mean living without suffering, it means rather having faith in God who truly knows and supports His people in that suffering.<br />This is an encouraging message for believers experiencing sufferings in their own pilgrimage of faith.  It makes \\"Byzantium\\" much more than a gripping page-turner, but a stimulating read that will enhance your perspective on life.  The beauty of this kind of Christian fiction, is that you share not only in the characters' sufferings and adventures, but also their spiritual growth.  Any novel that has the potential stimulate and encourage as well as entertain is a significant achievement indeed, and \\"Byzantium\\" is no exception.

In this third volume of the \\"Mark of the Lion\\" series, Francine Rivers chronicles the journey of the ex-gladiator Atretes back to his Germanic homeland, accompanied by the Christian widow Rizpah, nursemaid to his son. For Atretes, it proves to be much more than just a journey to his barbarian Chatti tribe, but also a romantic journey of love, and a spiritual journey of faith.<br /><br />Readers familiar with the \\"Mark of the Lion\\" series will know that the central issue of the first volume in the series - \\"A Voice in the Wind\\" - was how to witness to an unbelieving world, and this is the most powerful and convincing book of the entire series. Like the second volume of the series (\\"An Echo in the Darkness\\" - an exploration of forgiveness), the third volume (\\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" - an exploration of anger) is much more introspective than the first. Since \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" shares with \\"An Echo in the Darkness\\" a focus on inner conflict, it unfortunately also shares many of! its weaknesses. Certainly it has to be conceded that Rivers writes on a much higher level than most contemporary Christian fiction. When packed with a deep theological message, such literary fiction has the potential to pack a serious punch. But not when the theology is weak. Sadly, that is the case not only with \\"An Echo in the Darkness\\", but also with \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\".<br /><br />The most serious theological weakness is that Rivers places the events of her story *after* the apostolic era, and yet incorporates signs and wonders that were unique to the apostolic era. These include direct revelation (to Rizpah p.26 and Theophilus p.354), the gift of tongues (when the main characters suddenly speak German, p.314), and miracles (resurrection, p.278-80 and miraculous deliverance by walking on water, p.467). The presence of miracles outside of the apostolic era is particularly unfortunate, because Rivers makes them decisive turning points of the plot - in both instances resulting! in conversions. That the miracle of resurrection causes a conversion appears to be in direct contradiction with the words of Jesus in Luke 16:31 \\"If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\\" Not only do these miracles and wonders result in an overly optimistic story-line that fails to reflect the harshness of real life for Christians today, they are dependent on a tenuous theological position. If one agrees with the assertion that apostolic wonders and miracles ceased with the apostolic era, one must also concede the plot of \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" is not credible.<br /><br />There are other minor theological weaknesses that are not as crucial to the plot. The portrayal of first century worship (p.126) is questionable, and certainly the idea of \\"coming forward\\" (p.5) is anachronistic and without basis in the New Testament, and is more indicative of contemporary rather than ancient worship. The exegesis of several !Bible passages is highly disputable, such the use of Matt. 7:1 \\"do not judge\\" (p.53) which fails to take into consideration the immediate context dealing with hypocrisy; the use of 1 John 4 \\"love one another\\" to include unbelievers (p.83,373), despite the clear application of this text in Scripture to fellow believers; the suggestion that each piece of the armor of God in Eph. 6 is another name for Christ (p.87); the understanding of Rom. 6 as requiring baptism by immersion (p.283); and the explanation of Gen. 6:5 as meaning that after the fall there was just a \\"seed of sin\\" which progressed into increasing corruption (p.291). Also questionable are the assertions that Satan was God's most beautiful creation (p.291), that the Israelites are still God's children today (p.301), and that forgiveness is required independent of repentance (p.423 - note that Christ did not forgive his murderers, rather He *prayed* for their forgiveness). As usual, the theology of universal atonement !(p.60,112,314), partial depravity (p.248-9, 290) and the emphasis on Christ as an example rather than as an atoning substitute (p.306) is typically Arminian.<br /><br />Like the first volume of the series, the graphic allusions to Atretes' sexual relations outside of marriage and frank discussion of sexual thoughts makes \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" unsuitable for children. In fact the emphasis that Rivers lays on physical attraction is somewhat disturbing (p.187,189). Romantic love appears to play just as much a role as religion in determining the course of events, as evidenced in the fact that one of the religious climaxes of the novel (baptism) is promptly overshadowed by a romantic climax (marriage). The fact that this baptism was rather premature (one of the characters later observes that the baptized person does not even really understand what it means to be a Christian! p.309) appears to confirm this.<br /><br />The above criticisms may seem harsh but they are honest. At the same time!, there are many positive theological insights that Rivers successfully and effectively shares. The fact that the apostle John quotes numerous Scripture passages verbatim is a real strength. The portrayal of spiritual conflict as the gospel is proclaimed in pagan territory is particularly convincing. Rivers' description of demonic powers at work among the pagans under the guise of their gods is powerful and accurate. Thankfully the third volume of the series is not ALL internal conflict like the second volume, and thus overcomes some of its weaknesses. There are also some exciting action scenes reminiscent of the first volume. A reasonable effort, but unfortunately not enough to equal the first gem produced in this series.

Because of Tolkien's reputation as a master story-teller, I began reading this book with absurdly high expectations.  The slow beginning confirmed my suspicions that such high expectations could not possibly be realistic, and I prepared myself to be gloriously disappointed.  Quite honestly, by the end of the first chapter I shared the opinion of the protagonist, the hobbit: I was rather unenthusiastic, and doubtful that the \\"adventure\\" which lay ahead could truly be as exciting as it promised to be. <br />But Tolkien rarely disappoints.  Within pages, along with our hobbit hero, Bilbo Baggins, I found myself launched into the famous fantasy world that is the product of Tolkien's imagination, a world of never-ending adventure, mystery and magic.  As I joined the hobbit on his remarkable quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reconquer the dwarves long-lost treasure, I met a wonderful array of friends and foes - wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and a myriad of other fantastic creatures - and my imagination and interest never waned.  <br />By the end of the hobbit's adventure, like Bilbo, I was thoroughly satisfied.  At the conclusion, the wizard Gandalf remarks to the hobbit: \\"My dear Bilbo!  Something is the matter with you!  You are not the hobbit that you were.\\"  Yet it was not only the hobbit that had changed as a result of this adventure.  As a reader, I had to confess that I too had changed.  My initial lack of enthusiasm had entirely vanished.  I had participated in the hobbit's adventures, and like him, returned the better for it.  Tolkien's imaginative world is a world so vivid, that you cannot fail to return to the real world a changed person.  His descriptive abilities cannot fail to imprint his imaginary world in your memory.  This story is not deep, but it is delightful and unforgettable.  And like the hobbit, you will return to life the better having read it.  <br />What's more, you can go \\"there and back again\\" again, and again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off.  For all ages, this book is eminently readable and re-readable, and belongs on every bookshelf.  Don't miss it, because you will miss one of the most enchanting escapes that literature has to offer.	2001-06-28

NOT!	\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is not for everyone.  If you're used to a junk food diet of contemporary easy-to-read thrillers, you'll find \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" tough going.  This is no bag of high-cholesterol potato chips to be consumed in five minutes - this is a sack of solid food to be enjoyed over several evenings!  Unlike the brief attractions offered by a 100-meter sprint, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" offers the scenic adventures of a 100-mile walk.  It's an enduring and challenging journey, with a multitude of memorable pleasures.<br />Whose journey is it?  At the face of it, it is a journey undertaken by the hobbit Frodo and his companions.  Frodo possesses a most powerful ring, and the only way to prevent this ring from ever falling into the hands of the powers of evil is to destroy it - in the very heart of the kingdom of evil.  \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" describes the epic journey of the ring-bearer Frodo and his companions as they journey into the heart of enemy territory to do battle with the powers of evil.  If they successfully accomplish their quest, they will assure the conquest of evil by good.<br />But it is not just Frodo who makes this marathon journey.  Tolkien has an uncanny ability to ensnare the reader, so that you will find yourself not just a spectator, but a participant in the marathon mission undertaken by Frodo and friends.  The ringbearer Frodo and his company will become more than mere travelling companions.  They will become your friends.  You will feel you know them, and grow to love them - their joys will excite you, their sorrows will hurt you, their conquests will delight you, their failures will grief you.  And it will pain you to say goodbye to them at the end.<br />In the course of this long journey, you will be presented with breath-taking scenery.  Tolkien has a remarkable ability to describe scenery with colour, character and clarity, so that you will visualize every tree, rock and road.  By the time you are done, the setting of Middle-Earth will be as real as any place you've visited.  As such, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not just about a story and a journey, but about a place - and an immense and grand one.  Tolkien has created cultures, histories, and languages.  The vast scope of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" makes it a truly epic novel.<br />In fact, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" has all the qualities of an epic - immense scope combined with a heroic and grand style.  Tolkien constantly displays a mastery of the English language - the word usage is in turn gloriously grand, passionately poetic, wonderfully descriptive, but always amazing.  Together, the vast scope and elevated style combine to create a truly epic masterpiece, so that the three volumes of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" read like three acts of tremendously immense play, with a global cast of characters, and a worldwide stage.  And as you read, you are never quite sure whether this play is going to be a tragedy or triumph, as the powers of good seek to overcome the powers of evil.<br />This struggle between good and evil that actually makes \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a deeply religious book.  Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and although he adamantly maintained that it was written for pure entertainment and had no deeper meaning, he could not avoid being influenced by his religious background, as is evidenced by his sharp view on morality, where good and evil are viewed as moral absolutes.  The epic struggle between good and evil occurs on a wider scale than in \\"The Hobbit\\", and this gives the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a much more serious tone, arising out of deeply rooted religious convictions.  Yet the struggle of good against evil never becomes simplistic or shallow.  As in real life, Tolkien's characters have weaknesses and flaws, and are affected by their experiences - some on the side of good even being corrupted by evil.  And this makes the epic struggle for truth, freedom, justice and goodness all the more stimulating as you return to real life.  One cannot be unaffected by the commitment and undying devotion towards the cause of good, even when it requires unselfish sacrifices to be made in the process.  In this sense, those who share Tolkien's underlying Christian values will especially enjoy the epic journey he has created.<br />But you do not have to be a Christian to enjoy \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  There is nothing overtly religious about this trilogy, since the universe Tolkien creates and describes is a universe without God, where chance and fate are acknowledged as crucial players of the game, and where the conquest of evil is accomplished by the power of one's own will.  This is probably exactly what we can expect from a Catholic writer.<br />If you have never read \\"The Lord of Rings\\", you should read it if only for the fact that it is widely acclaimed as the greatest fantasy ever.  Few have read it and failed to be affected by.  If you have not yet read it, a most distinct pleasure and experience awaits you.  Yet the captivation of the reading experience is far from over at the end of its pages.  The epic scale of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is so grand, that it begs to be read again and again.  When you've read it once, you have the feeling that you have only just scratched the surface of something truly great.  Like an amusement park with too many attractions to see in one day, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" leaves you in constant wonder, and when you are done, you pledge to return again soon.  It is this enduring quality of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" that makes it a truly great read, a memorable and monumental marathon journey often to be repeated.al life.

In \\"Wonderland\\", Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down.  With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems.  Here's a small taste:<br />\\"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\\" said the Cat.  \\"I'd nearly forgotten to ask.\\"<br />\\"It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way.<br />\\"I thought it would,\\" said the Cat, and vanished again.<br />And another quote:<br />\\"...they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M -\\"<br />\\"Why with an M?\\" said Alice.<br />\\"Why not?\\" said the March Hare.<br />If you find this kind of maddening surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's \\"Wonderland\\".  You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of \\"Off with his head.\\"  \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy.  What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies.  Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults.  A \\"classic\\" is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\"<br />Is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" all nonsense?  I don't think so.  Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense.  He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted.  Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time.

Douglas Adams' description of Arthur Dent, who is the lone man to survive the destruction of the planet earth, is consistently humorous and entertaining.  Dent is set loose to roam the galaxy, accompanied with an alien friend who is thankfully equipped with the indispensable Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.<br />As the novel progresses, it becomes evident that despite the superficial whimsical tone, Adams is dealing with deeper themes relating to the meaning and existence of human life.  The absurdity created by his imagination is not just a matter of light-hearted sci-fi entertainment, but is a cloak which Adams uses to convey his philosophy of human life and his personal worldview.<br />One needs to recall that this novel was born in the late 1970s, in the hey-day of technology and space travel, a time when there was a great deal of optimism and faith in science as the saviour of mankind.  Adams mocks this human arrogance.  The arrogance of Bent's fellow-humans in destroying his home, becomes a microcosm for the arrogance of humankind, and when it is applied to man's own home earth, results in man's own destruction.  Adams' scorn for scientific arrogance is especially manifest when it appears that the rulers of earth are not scientists, but their own laboratory mice, who were secretly conducting large-scale experiments on their captors all along.<br />Yet this novel achieves much more than a scoffing of scientific arrogance.  It becomes painfully evident that something essential is missing from the universe described in the Hitchhiker's Guide: God.  When questioned by man about his existence, God \\"promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.\\"  God's absence from Adams' fictional universe corresponds to God's absence in Adams' personal worldview.  The worldview which Adams believes in and portrays is a galaxy without a Creator.  Adams is in fact a self-confessed \\"radical atheist\\", and holds this position very seriously.<br />But if Adam's universe is a world without God, this leads to an inevitable question: In such a universe, what is the meaning and purpose of life?  Adams toys with this question when he describes the \\"The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.\\"  After seven and a half million years of calculation, the super computer \\"Deep Thought\\" announces that the answer is \\"Forty-two.\\"  This meaningless answer is incomprehensible, and is apparently so because we don't understand the question properly!  Here Adams whimsically propounds his purpose for planet earth: earth is a gigantic experiment, because it is on earth that the question about the meaning and purpose of life is voiced, but never answered!  The purpose of earth is to raise the question about its purpose.<br />In Adams' atheistic worldview, the question about the purpose of life cannot be answered, because the existence of the very creator of the universe is denied.  Such a question can only be asked, answered, and understood in a Christian worldview where the existence of the Creator is maintained, because apart from Him, creation is indeed purposeless.  In this respect, the message of Adams' classic is the same as that of the Bible book of Ecclesiastes: there is no purpose and meaning in a world that rejects God.  However, it is eternally unfortunate that Adams does not have the same conclusion as Ecclesiastes, where the premise of practical atheism is reversed, God's existence once again affirmed, and purpose discovered by serving and obeying God the Creator.  Present day adherents of practical atheism who share Adams' empty worldview will discover that they will spend their life in the same way as Adams - in life whimsically hitchhiking an empty earth without God, and in death discovering that God was always there, but that by their rejection of Him in the past, they will spend eternity without Him in the future.  But then it will be too late.  Because unlike the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, eternity without God has no room for frivolous laughter, but only for sorrow and regret.<br />In endorsing an atheistic worldview, Adams is to be most pitied. In portraying the emptiness of an atheistic worldview, Adams is outstanding, his book a classic.t then it will be too late.

In this classic, Baum describes the tale of poor Dorothy, who is hurled by a cyclone away from her uncle and aunt in Kansas into a strange and magical world of wizards and witches.  Fortunately Dorothy has the help of several companions that she meets in this new world - a stuffed scarecrow who wants brains, a tin woodsman who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who wants courage.  Together with Dorothy - who wants a return trip to Kansas - they travel to the emerald city where Oz is wizard, to ask him to make their wishes come true.  Their journey is fraught with adventures, and when they finally meet Oz they discover a terrible truth that leads them into even more challenges and adventures.  The magical fantasy of this tale has pleased readers of all ages for a century, and it's not hard to see why.  Baum spins a wonderfully enchanting tale that includes wicked witches, flying monkeys, talking mice, and other fantastic creatures.<br />Is this book more than just a fantasy thrill?  Some literary critics have proposed that Baum - a strong believer in individualism and self-confidence - is working with themes about self-esteem and self-reliance.  This is quite plausible, especially considering that the brains, heart and courage sought by the scarecrow, woodsman and lion are abilities that they clearly already possess - they just need to recognize them and use them.  And Dorothy herself discovers that when the wizard can't help her, she must and can rely on herself.  Other literary critics have claimed that \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" needs to be read as an elaborate political allegory where the various characters represent various social classes and financial structures - a not impossible suggestion, but one that's somewhat difficult to defend.  Ultimately, however, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is best enjoyed as a wonderful story.  That doesn't mean it is any less of a contribution to English literature, because when appreciated as a brilliant story, you're sure to come back to it again and again, as are your children and grandchildren.

Tolkien has an uncanny ability to ensnare the reader, so that you will find yourself not just a spectator, but a participant in the marathon mission undertaken by Frodo and friends.  The ringbearer Frodo and his company will become more than mere travelling companions.  They will become your friends.  You will feel you know them, and grow to love them  their joys will excite you, their sorrows will hurt you, their conquests will delight you, their failures will grief you.  And it will pain you to say goodbye to them at the end.<br />In the course of this long journey, you will be presented with breath-taking scenery.  Tolkien has a remarkable ability to describe scenery with colour, character and clarity, so that you will visualize every tree, rock and road.  By the time you are done, the setting of Middle-Earth will be as real as any place youve visited.  As such, The Lord of the Rings is not just about a story and a journey, but about a place  and an immense and grand one.  Tolkien has created cultures, histories, and languages.  The vast scope of The Lord of the Rings makes it a truly epic novel.<br />In fact, The Lord of the Rings has all the qualities of an epic  immense scope combined with a heroic and grand style.  Tolkien constantly displays a mastery of the English language  the word usage is in turn gloriously grand, passionately poetic, wonderfully descriptive, but always amazing.  Together, the vast scope and elevated style combine to create a truly epic masterpiece, so that the three volumes of The Lord of the Rings read like three acts of tremendously immense play, with a global cast of characters, and a worldwide stage.  And as you read, you are never quite sure whether this play is going to be a tragedy or triumph, as the powers of good seek to overcome the powers of evil.<br />This struggle between good and evil that actually makes The Lord of the Rings a deeply religious book.  Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and although he adamantly maintained that it was written for pure entertainment and had no deeper meaning, he could not avoid being influenced by his religious background, as is evidenced by his sharp view on morality, where good and evil are viewed as moral absolutes.  The epic struggle between good and evil occurs on a wider scale than in The Hobbit, and this gives the The Lord of the Rings a much more serious tone, arising out of deeply rooted religious convictions.  Yet the struggle of good against evil never becomes simplistic or shallow.  As in real life, Tolkiens characters have weaknesses and flaws, and are affected by their experiences  some on the side of good even being corrupted by evil.  And this makes the epic struggle for truth, freedom, justice and goodness all the more stimulating as you return to real life.  One cannot be unaffected by the commitment and undying devotion towards the cause of good, even when it requires unselfish sacrifices to be made in the process.  In this sense, those who share Tolkiens underlying Christian values will especially enjoy the epic journey he has created.<br />But you do not have to be a Christian to enjoy The Lord of the Rings.  There is nothing overtly religious about this trilogy, since the universe Tolkien creates and describes is a universe without God, where chance and fate are acknowledged as crucial players of the game, and where the conquest of evil is accomplished by the power of ones own will.  This is probably exactly what we can expect from a Catholic writer.<br />If you have never read The Lord of Rings, you should read it if only for the fact that it is widely acclaimed as the greatest fantasy ever.  Few have read it and failed to be affected by.  If you have not yet read it, a most distinct pleasure and experience awaits you.  Yet the captivation of the reading experience is far from over at the end of its pages.  The epic scale of The Lord of the Rings is so grand, that it begs to be read again and again.  When youve read it once, you have the feeling that you have only just scratched the surface of something truly great.  Like an amusement park with too many attractions to see in one day, The Lord of the Rings leaves you in constant wonder, and when you are done, you pledge to return again soon.  It is this enduring quality of The Lord of the Rings that makes it a truly great read, a memorable and monumental marathon journey often to be repeated.al life.

Because of Tolkien's reputation as a master story-teller, I began reading this book with absurdly high expectations.  The slow beginning confirmed my suspicions that such high expectations could not possibly be realistic, and I prepared myself to be gloriously disappointed.  Quite honestly, by the end of the first chapter I shared the opinion of the protagonist, the hobbit: I was rather unenthusiastic, and doubtful that the \\"adventure\\" which lay ahead could truly be as exciting as it promised to be. <br />But Tolkien rarely disappoints.  Within pages, along with our hobbit hero, Bilbo Baggins, I found myself launched into the famous fantasy world that is the product of Tolkien's imagination, a world of never-ending adventure, mystery and magic.  As I joined the hobbit on his remarkable quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reconquer the dwarves long-lost treasure, I met a wonderful array of friends and foes - wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and a myriad of other fantastic creatures - and my imagination and interest never waned.  <br />By the end of the hobbit's adventure, like Bilbo, I was thoroughly satisfied.  At the conclusion, the wizard Gandalf remarks to the hobbit: \\"My dear Bilbo!  Something is the matter with you!  You are not the hobbit that you were.\\"  Yet it was not only the hobbit that had changed as a result of this adventure.  As a reader, I had to confess that I too had changed.  My initial lack of enthusiasm had entirely vanished.  I had participated in the hobbit's adventures, and like him, returned the better for it.  Tolkien's imaginative world is a world so vivid, that you cannot fail to return to the real world a changed person.  His descriptive abilities cannot fail to imprint his imaginary world in your memory.  This story is not deep, but it is delightful and unforgettable.  And like the hobbit, you will return to life the better having read it.  <br />What's more, you can go \\"there and back again\\" again, and again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off.  For all ages, this book is eminently readable and re-readable, and belongs on every bookshelf.  Don't miss it, because you will miss one of the most enchanting escapes that literature has to offer.	2001-06-28
US	51067904	RG5GBJ60VKXSY	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	4	241	267	N	N	A brief guide to the philosophy of Dune.	Frank Herbert's Nebula and Hugo award-winning &quot;Dune&quot; is widely acclaimed as the best science fiction work.  And rightly so.  As entertainment it's a suspenseful tale of adventure that sparkles with imaginative creativity.  When the family of Paul Atreides arrives on the desert planet &quot;Arrakis&quot; or &quot;Dune&quot;, they find that their goal to take over rule from the Harkonnen family is difficult to achieve.  Paul faces treachery, murder, as well as the rigorous conditions of a dry and deadly planet where water is more precious than gold.  It is only with the help of the mysterious battle-hardened desert tribe of Fremen, and his newly-discovered religious powers that Paul stands any chance of triumphing over the powers of evil.  The plot has a complexity of layers reminiscent of Tolkien.<br />The sci-fi classification does not mean &quot;Dune&quot; is inaccessible to non-sci-fi fans, because most of the traditional sci-fi elements are either absent or mere background.  Several remarkable scenes of hand to hand combat are more reminiscent of ancient Roman gladiators than of science fiction!  There are weaknesses: mature themes (such as allusions to pedastry) make &quot;Dune&quot; unsuitable for children, and Herbert's use of language is not outstanding. But what especially makes &quot;Dune&quot; great is the complexity of ideas.  Herbert has created not just a story, but a memorable world conveying an elaborate philosophy of ideas, with three outstanding themes:<br />1. ECOLOGY.  Arrakis is a barren and bare planet of desert sands, with characters reminiscent of desert Arabs (Herbert studied Arabic extensively in researching for the novel). As well as hosting titanic deadly sandworms, the desert sands feature a mysterious and narcotic spice substance known as Melange, which is central to the diet of its inhabitants, heightens powers of awareness, and is a central part of the economy.  The power and value of water in this hostile sandscape environment is manifested in that shedding tears is an expression of great devotion.  It becomes evident that there is a plan to rescue this planet from its barrenness and turn it into a paradise.  Significantly the book is dedicated to dry land ecologists.  Herbert was an accomplished ecologist himself, and one wonders whether he is expressing his own vision of the possibility of a man-achieved paradise on earth.<br />2. POLITICS.  There is a complex interplay of people, tribes, politics and economics, with constant scheming, plots and subterfuge revolving around personal and political ambitions.  Herbert has created an intricate and plausible history of tribes and peoples, with unique languages (much originating from Arabic), names and ambitions.  The lust for power and wealth is combined with a determination to succeed at all costs, stopping at nothing - even murder - to achieve it.  The political corruption and chaos of Dune's world is analogous to our contemporary world, as Herbert once observed in an interview: &quot;the scarce water of Dune is an exact analog of oil scarcity.  CHOAM is OPEC.&quot;  Paul's triumphant leadership is also thematic.  In humanizing a messiah figure, Herbert raises an important question: why do people blindly follow leaders?  &quot;Dune&quot; conveys his theory that &quot;superheroes are disastrous for mankind&quot; because even the greatest leaders are human.  Despite their strengths, relying completely on them is fatal.<br />3. RELIGION.  Religion is inter-woven with politics, and centers on women, such as the powerful matriarch, the Reverend Mother. Herbert at times seems to picture religion as the manipulation of the masses by the intelligent, since the Orthodox Catholic Bible functions as a human invention rather than divine revelation. The strong religious component especially comes to the fore with Paul, a Messiah figure who fulfils prophecies, the long awaited Kwisatz Haderach who is somehow both man and god, and from whom all blessings flow.  These prophecies have their own pitfalls - and are used to show the paradox of a system of predistination.  The religion is a mixture of Christianity, Islam (jihad and similar Arabic words are clearly borrowed), Buddhist philosophy, and a strong eastern mystical component. Strangely, there is no active involvement of the Creator, since &quot;the most persistent principles of the universe are accident and error.&quot;  The power of the divine resides instead within oneself, and there are definite occultic overtones, such as the mention of &quot;wierding&quot; (a form of witchcraft), and very obvious new age Eastern spiritualism and mysticism.  Herbert also makes a profound connection between technology and religion.  In light of the fact that this novel was written at the hey-day of space travel and lunar landings, it is remarkable that in an appendix Herbert observes that technology and space travel affects one's view of creation.  In his opinion, the god of technology and machine-logic is destined to be dethroned, and replaced with a renewed realization of the significance of man.  Instead of placing hope in machines, it is to be placed in mankind.  Herbert optimism about mankind is evident: a self-made paradise is attainable.<br />In short, Herbert has created a plausible world, reflecting his multi-faceted interests in society, culture, environment, politics, religion and science.  Dune's fictional cultures (Fremen), political parties (Harkonnen, Atreides), worlds (Dune), languages, religions, customs, geography, and ecology are imaginative, realistic, and function in a rich complexity that places him in the same league as  Tolkien and similar eminent writers.  Though written in the 1960s, the fact that Dune is still relevant, readable and in no way outdated is a testimony to its greatness.  You will find that this book has so much depth that you will not just read it once, but many times, with increasing enjoyment. So, don't hesitate, head for the sands of Dune for an unforgettable adventure!ngs flow.  These prophecies have their own pitfalls - and are used to show the paradox of a system of predistination.

US	51067904	R2QXC54CIQMIJY	0380781042	166804775	Grail (The Pendragon Cycle, Book 5)	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Warfare turns spiritual.	&quot;Grail&quot; is the last volume of Lawhead's Pendragon series.  It is narrated by Gwalchavad, and revolves around the mysterious and magical Grail which was the cause of Arthur's miraculous healing at the end of the previous volume. The Grail is the cup used by Christ in his last supper (p.45), and has healing powers.  Arthur's kingdom is firmly established now that the Saecsons and Vandals have both been defeated.  Now that the Kingdom of Summer is officially inaugurated, the Grail is seen as a symbol of this kingdom of light.  So Arthur builds a shrine for this symbol of his kingdom, and the kingdom of summer is officially declared.<br />Just when the kingdom of summer reaches its high point, tragedy strikes.  At the height of the kingdom's glory, the subversive attacks of Morgian return.  This Queen of the Powers of the Air and Darkness steals the sacred Grail, abducts Arthur's queen, and deceives his champion soldier.  From this point on the action intensifies, as the newly established kingdom of peace fights warfare on a new front: spiritual warfare.  Unlike the battle scenes of previous volumes, the battle scenes in this book describe a struggle against demons and the powers of darkness (Eph. 6).<br />Lawhead's vision of the Grail did make me uncomfortable.  Firstly, the cup used by Jesus was an ordinary object, and to have it turn into a sparkling grail with rows of rubies, emeralds, and pearls, with a &quot;broad band of impossibly ornate scrollwork&quot; seems to go against the very purpose of the last supper. Secondly, the purpose of the supper was to encourage believers in their spiritual worship and commemoration of Christ, not in a material worship of a sacred object.  The words of Jesus - &quot;Remember and believe&quot; - seem all but forgotten, since healing through the Grail appears to occur independent of faith and believing.  Rather than stress faith, the use of the Grail results in a magical form of healing that occurs through ritual rather than faith.  One other concern is the ease at which the characters take God's name on their lips - at times it borders on blasphemy and unnecessary oath-making.<br />But these weaknesses aside, Lawhead has created a convincing and exciting spiritual conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil.  The spiritual warfare is a refreshing change from the blood and gore of earlier battlefields.  It also functions as a compelling image of the universal conflict between God and Satan, a conflict involving both God and men.  The power of evil is vividly portrayed.  Here Lawhead successfully reminds us of the Biblical notion of angels of darkness disguising themselves as angels of light, and deceiving even believers.  The weakness and vulnerability of men over against these powers is vividly described.  But most importantly, when men are helpless over against the powers of evil, Lawhead presents the only path to victory: God.  Conquest of evil cannot be accomplished by human effort, but by divine power.  &quot;Only by God's good grace do any of us stand or fall.&quot; (p.377)<br />&quot;Grail&quot; marks the end of the wonderful Pendragon cycle.  It is true that while the ending of &quot;Grail&quot; resolves the conflict, it does not satisfactorily mark a clean ending to the series.  This is not surprising because &quot;Grail&quot; (like the preceding volume &quot;Pendragon&quot;) actually precedes the events described at the end of book 3, &quot;Arthur&quot;, and consequently both &quot;Pendragon&quot; and &quot;Grail&quot; have a distinctively &quot;add on&quot; feeling.  Next time I will read the series in chronological order, more or less as follows: Taliesin, Merlin, Pendragon Bk. 1, Arthur Bk. 1-2, Pendragon Bk. 2-4, Grail, Arthur Bk. 3.  The chronological aberrations of the last two volumes are indeed a weakness, and it is unfortunate they function more like an afterthought, rather than being properly integrated into Arthur's life. Yet the very fact that this series is so re-readable is a testimony to its greatness.  Great it truly is, and that is high praise indeed!his series is so re-readable is a testimony to its greatness.  Great it truly is, and that is high praise indeed!	2001-04-05
US	51067904	R3H9HZ62JCVI6	0380717573	636083362	Pendragon (The Pendragon Cycle, Book 4)	Books	4	39	41	N	N	Be forewarned about this one...then it won't disappoint!	Fans of the first three volumes of Lawhead's &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot; need to be forewarned about two things before they commence this fourth volume of the series.<br />Firstly, &quot;Pendragon&quot; is not a continuation of the story that ended in volume 3.  &quot;Taliesin&quot;, &quot;Merlin&quot; and &quot;Arthur&quot; complete Lawhead's retelling of the Arthurian legends, and form a complete and independent story in themselves.  In &quot;Pendragon&quot;, Lawhead expands on a part of the story about king Arthur that he has already described by recounting one of the struggles that the king Arthur faced in the early days of his kingship.<br />Secondly, &quot;Pendragon&quot; does not match the high standards of the three volumes that preceded it.  Readers familiar with the first three volumes will find that Lawhead recounts much of Arthur's life that they are already familiar with.  In fact, the description of Arthur's king-making is nearly identical word for word to the description of this same event found in &quot;Arthur&quot;, the only difference being that &quot;Pendragon&quot; recounts the event from the perspective of Merlin.  But the initial drama and sense of passion and glory is gone, because we have been here before.  Even though events such as Arthur's youth are described in more detail here than in &quot;Arthur&quot;, the fact remains that we already know the basic plot, and this detracts from the amount of enjoyment you can expect.<br />Yet with this warning in mind, &quot;Pendragon&quot; is still a worthwhile read.  Lawhead focuses on one aspect of Arthur's reign, namely his conflict against the barbarian Vandals and against a pestilent plague.  Don't be confused: this is not an enemy described in &quot;Arthur&quot;, hence its ascription as &quot;The Forgotten War&quot; (Chronologically both &quot;Pendragon&quot; - aside from the first part - and &quot;Grail&quot; both fit between books 2 &amp; 3 of &quot;Arthur&quot;)<br />In this great conflict, the human element strongly comes into the foreground, especially the twin roles of the bard Merlin, and the king Arthur.  The first point of view heightens the readers understanding of Merlin's role in this conflict.  Lawhead's treatment of Merlin is profound, and particularly outstanding in my mind is one passage where Merlin comes to realize that &quot;in order to welcome redemption, one must first embrace the utter hopelessness of failure.  For how can a man look for rescue unless he knows he is truly lost?&quot; (p.69) - a wonderful metaphor of salvation for lost sinners.  Equally outstanding is Merlin's journey to the other-world, where Lawhead uses a profound sequence of events to bring Merlin to understand his role in the great conflict over against evil.<br />Also profound is Lawhead's treatment of Arthur.  The last third of the book in my view is a climactic masterpiece, and after being entranced by the last section of the novel, Lawhead's weaknesses in the first half of the book were quickly forgiven and forgotten.  Arthur's role in the struggle against the enemies of the people is central: as leader and king he must fight on behalf of his people.  In an absolutely unforgettable climax, the whole weight of his people's hopes depend on him, as Arthur himself must single-handedly take on the leader of the barbarians in a battle to the death.  The imagery will not be lost on you, as Arthur makes a distinctly Messianic figure, bruised for his people, a Christ-like king giving his everything for his people at the risk of his own life.<br />Yes, &quot;Pendragon&quot; has weaknesses.  Does this make &quot;Pendragon&quot; a failure?  If you were not forewarned, you would likely be disappointed.  Even if you are forewarned, you may still be disappointed with the first half of the book because it lacks Lawhead's typical depth and drama.  But in the last half of the book Lawhead more than redeems himself with a captivating narrative that you won't be able to put down,and will in the end leave you breathless at its sparkling imagery and depth, and eagerly grabbing the next volume in the series.and will in the end leave you breathless at its sparkling imagery and depth, and eagerly grabbing the next volume in the series.	2001-04-05
US	51067904	R2TSXDY75PBUG3	0380708906	357909673	Arthur (Pendragon Cycle)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Ignites a passion for a king and kingdom.	With &quot;Arthur&quot;, the third title in his acclaimed &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot;, Lawhead finally progress beyond the stage-setting scenes of the first two titles.  Not surprisingly, the spotlight in this novel is Arthur, as Lawhead chronicles his progression from a fatherless and unknown teenager, to the Duke of Britain, to the High King of Britain, and finally to the Emperor of the West.<br />Unlike the preceding titles, &quot;Arthur&quot; features countless battles, and plunges the reader from glorious victories to devastating defeats.  But the primary note is one of victory, as Arthur overcomes the hostile forces both from within and outside of Britain to establish a magnificent Summer Kingdom.  &quot;Arthur&quot; is especially characterized by exciting medieval warfare, complete with clever and ingenious military strategy (sieges, ambushes), military tactics of infantry and cavalry, naval jousting, and plain man-to-man combat.  The sheer intensity of the action layered with political intrigue and suspense alone makes this a gripping read.<br />But this is so much more than a novel about military conquests.  Arthur's leadership and kingdom have definite overtones of the remarkable Israelite victories under Moses, Joshua and Gideon.  With the battle cry &quot;For God and Britain&quot;, Arthur and his brave warriors fight valiantly, but constantly ascribe victory to God alone.  &quot;If the High King of Heaven fights for us, who can prevail against us?&quot; (p.294)<br />But not only is the conflict helped by God, it is also for God.  Lawhead identifies Arthur's kingdom with the cause of Christ, and portrays his battles against the barbarians as a conflict between Arthur and the True God and &quot;the barbarians and their loathly idols.&quot; (p.265)  His battles are God's battles, and battles for God's kingdom.  Arthur's glorious kingdom strongly resembles the legendary kingdom of justice and peace of king Solomon.  It is clearly a symbol of the kingdom of Christ, the glorious Kingdom of Summer, described by prophecy as follows:  &quot;...a land where kings extend their hands in justice rather than reach for the sword; where mercy, kindness, and compassion flow like deep water over the land, and men revere virtue, revere truth, revere beauty, above comfort, pleasure, or selfish gain.  A land where peace reigns in the hearts of men; where faith blazes like a beacon from every hill and love like a fire from every hearth; where the True God is worshiped and his ways acclaimed by all.&quot; (p.136)  As High King of Britain, Arthur serves as steward of the justice of the High King of Heaven (p.383).  Just like the days of Solomon, men flock from far and wide to learn from Arthur's justice, and marvel at his prosperity and peace.<br />Because Arthur's kingdom is a symbol of the Christ's great Kingdom of Light, it is set over against the Kingdom of Darkness.  Arthur's true foes are not just physical warriors armed with spears and battle axes.  He must wage war especially against a spiritual foe armed with the powers of darkness: the evil sorcery of Morgian.<br />But Arthur's desire to bring peace to the ends of the earth ultimately proves to be his downfall.  The book ends with an ambiguity that leaves your heart burning for the kingdom of light and sorrowing over the waves of darkness that assault it.  Is the conclusion intended to be an indictment of modern Britain for abandoning the principles of the Kingdom of Summer?  At any rate, it will not leave you unmoved.<br />Does the book have weaknesses?  Although it is clearly symbolic, one might question the wisdom of marrying church and state too closely, not unlike the excesses of emperor Constantine.  And Lawhead's understanding of the extent to which God controls evil is questionable (p.369).  Further, this book (along with others in the series) would benefit immensely from a more detailed map, as well as a extensive glossary of terms, people and places. Readers should also be forewarned that even though &quot;Arthur&quot; is only volume 3 in a series of 5, the last part of &quot;Arthur&quot; concludes the life-story of Arthur.  If you want to get the most enjoyment out of the two following volumes (Vol. 4 &quot;Pendragon&quot; &amp; Vol. 5 &quot;Grail&quot;), you would be well-advised to read them in their correct chronological place, namely before the third part of &quot;Arthur&quot;.  The ending of &quot;Arthur&quot; is best read at the very end of the series.  The ending is somewhat sudden and surprising, but on the other hand the dash of tragedy injected in the concluding pages makes the novel all the more convincing and makes our passion for the Kingdom of Summer burn all the brighter.  A more fitting ending to the life of Arthur is hardly conceivable.<br />But such weaknesses will be quickly buried under the novel's countless strengths.  There is so much to say about this novel - the gripping plot, the marvellous descriptive language, the evocative mood where even the landscape contributes to the atmosphere in a manner strongly reminiscent of Tolkien (a high compliment indeed!), the religious imagery.  Typical of Lawhead, you will find yourself partaking in genuine glory and in genuine grief.  Lawhead has an uncanny ability to stir emotions and passions.  The passion that Lawhead ignites for a king and a kingdom ultimately proves itself to be a passion for God and His kingdom.

In Avalon, Stephen Lawhead has modernized the king Arthur of his delightful Pendragon cycle, and transported him to a futuristic and contemporary twenty-first century Britain, which is on the verge of throwing out the monarchy for good.  But Lawhead is convinced that the monarchy is not all bathwater, but that there's a baby in there somewhere that should be preserved.  Make the legendary Arthur come back to life to be that baby, and save the monarchy.  There in a nutshell, is the plot of Avalon.<br />Of course there's much more to it than that, and it's impossible to summarize in a few words a plot that is ingeniously original.  The Pendragon Cycle is clearly a prelude to this story, and I would suggest that it is required reading for readers of Avalon.  Lawhead makes frequent and obvious allusions to the characters and events of the Pendragon Cycle (eg p.89ff), and readers unfamiliar with his earlier work are likely to find themselves perplexed without this background.  At any rate, readers familiar with Lawhead's earlier works are sure to get the most of this new tale.<br />Yet this is far from a modernized Pendragon - it's definitely a story on its own, and fans of the Pendragon Cycle are treated to a completely new tale.  The story begins shortly after the death of the last of a series of corrupt and selfish monarchs, with Britain on the verge of abandoning the monarchy for good.  Suddenly the unknown James Stuart discovers that despite his ordinary and obscure childhood, he is the rightful king of Britain, and the modern-day Arthur.  Although James has a modern-day Merlin at his side, victory of the monarchy is far from assured, because there's a modern-day Morgian and a host of evil powers against him in his quest for kingship and the restoration of Arthurian Britain.<br />As a followup to the Pendragon Cycle, Avalon is equally suspenseful and exciting, sparkling with originality, action and intrigue, although some characters and sequences lack imagination and depth.  But on the whole it is not as successful.  The return of Arthur into a contemporary world bears the suggestion of reincarnation, although Lawhead clearly distances himself from reincarnation and leaves the idea of the &quot;same life in another time&quot; as an unsolved mystery (p.159-160).  Likely the premise of the return of Arthur and his companions into a modern world is not intended to be a serious religious or philosophical idea, but a literary device.  But one can not be so gracious to Lawhead with respect to other modern elements of the story - the sexual allusions (p.178-9) and frequent use of blasphemy (over two dozen instances) detracted strongly from this novel and its Christian message.<br />Certainly the vision of the Kingdom of Summer is clearly expressed (p.265ff).  Furthermore, the struggle to establish the kingship over against the forces of evil is clearly intended to be a conflict that parallels the universal spiritual conflict between the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness (p.396).  James' struggle for kingship has definite overtones of the Biblical struggle of David before him (p.343), and overtones of the Christ whom he shadows.  But sadly, although the kingdom of summer is presented as a vision, we don't get to see this vision become a reality, because the accession to kingship marks the end of the novel (whether we are treated to another novel where we see a modern kingdom of summer is yet to be seen).<br />On the whole, Avalon lacks the profound religious depth that made the Pendragon Cycle so captivating.  With some exceptions, it is less religious and philosophical and more political.  In a contemporary era where the monarchy is largely perceived as irrelevant, one cannot but wonder whether the lengthy and passionate diatribes in Avalon defending the monarchy as a legitimate institution by divine right are in fact an articulation of Lawhead's own opinion on the subject.  Is the defence of and vision for the monarchy and the biting criticism of the corruption of today's politicians Lawhead's own?  Perhaps there's a pro-royalist and anti-democrat message here for leadership in our own time.

US	51067904	R1KYHWG5LD3APH	0785277099	351376566	Leviathan	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A Christian Jurassic Park?	Leviathan is one of Huggins' earliest novels, and precedes &quot;Cain&quot;, a book which established him in mainstream fiction and was also developed into a movie.  &quot;Leviathan&quot; is the name of a powerful beast that is the product of a secret science project in an underground facility deep in the Arctic Circle.  But Leviathan proves to be stronger and smarter than its creators, and when it escapes its containment chamber, it threatens to kill everyone in reach.  But that isn't the only problem - Leviathan's escape sets off a fail-safe sequence that will detonate a nuclear device within 24 hours.  There is only one way to escape the nuclear holocaust: by killing Leviathan within 24 hours.  This book features heart-stopping suspense as the only ones who can stop Leviathan are the giant Norwegian Thor, and the unassuming electrical wizard Connor.  Can they stop Leviathan?  Can they do it within 24 hours?  Two words sum up the plot that unravels:<br />1. Action thriller.  The novel starts with a bang, and rarely slows down.  Huggins has a style that will leave your heart pounding, and you'll find yourself racing over the words and through the pages.  The action never lets up, so prepare yourself for a roller-coaster ride of action.  Only one problem: expect to see the same scenery.  The &quot;terrible roar&quot; of Leviathan and the &quot;hate-filled rage&quot; of its hunters rapidly wears thin after the umpteenth time.  Certainly the action is fast and furious, but the dragon's repeated roar and the repeated shouts and shooting of his hunters gets tiresome after a while.  Also be warned that the extent of blood and gore is not suitable for children.<br />2. Apocalyptic themes.  Unlike most thrillers, Huggins is clearly working with deeper themes.  There is a clear and cosmic conflict between good and evil, and Huggins makes several Biblical references to ensure that we understand this is a picture of the conflict between God and Satan.  The name &quot;Leviathan&quot; is drawn straight from the Bible (p.44), and is an ancient name for &quot;dragon&quot; (p.68).  Although Huggins' exegesis and historical description of Leviathan is questionable (p.73ff), the apocalyptic imagery is unmistakable, as we get glimpses of the beast rising from the sea described in Revelation.  Huggins' story does not completely fit with Revelation, which describes both a dragon and several beasts.  Revelation's imagery is symbolic - whereas Huggins tries to present this as a real conflict with a real dragon.  But probably it would be unfair to criticize him too severely for this: he intends the conflict against Leviathan to be a spiritual picture of the great struggle against evil and its master, Satan.  He takes great pains to describe the background of this conflict as the fall into sin, and presents the battle against Leviathan as a microcosm of the great and last battle, the Armageddon (p.63-4).  In Huggins' view, all of life is spiritual, and is part of the great struggle of good and evil (p.231).  Thor is the Messiah figure who features prominently in the great battle against evil, and like Christ is even pierced in his side (p.326), as he struggles valiantly against the dragon, even willing to give his own life for those he loves.<br />But ultimately the philosophy and deeper religious significance is washed away by a superficial stream of repetitive story-line.  Although gripping and suspenseful, the plot is not always completely convincing, its characters not completely credible.  Any serious message that this book has to offer is hampered by a plot that seems to have the same fighting, rage and fire over and over again.  The great deal of technical jargon about computers and science does lend the novel some authenticity, but also weighs it down unnecessarily.  Whatever religious meaning the novel does have to offer is further undermined by the stream of hate and curses unleashed by its hero Thor, and the surprisingly frequent instancesof blasphemy  (p.137,148,205,313) and unnecessary oaths (p.239,260).<br />In the end, I felt that I was reading a script for a revised movie of Jurassic Park, rather than a Christian thriller novel.  If you like reading about men being crunched in the jaws of a giant predator and fighting back with all kinds of weapons, you'll love this novel.  It's Jurassic Park all over again, with a Christian slant, but not quite with an equally successful execution.  Don't expect a whole lot more than that.of blasphemy  (p.137,148,205,313) and unnecessary oaths (p.239,260).<br />In the end, I felt that I was reading a script for a revised movie of Jurassic Park, rather than a Christian thriller novel.

This Rita award winning novel further chronicles the life of Marcus and Julia as part of Francine Rivers' highly acclaimed &quot;Mark of the Lion&quot; series.  Volume 1 (&quot;Voice in the Wind&quot;) portrayed the voice of God in the life of Hadassah, and now in volume 2 Hadassah's voice continues to echo in the dark and empty lives of Marcus and Julia (p.12-13).  The darkness and emptiness of their lives is one of the highlights of the novel.  Rivers has created a vivid and wonderful portrait of the truth of Ecclesiastes - the emptiness and vanity of a life where one pursues anything except God.  Just like today's world, Rome offers wealth, pleasure, power and knowledge (p.292).  Both Marcus and Julia come to discover the pursuit of pleasure, work, money and sexuality eventually proves to be meaningless and empty - the same conclusion as Ecclesiastes.  But will they come to discover that meaning is found instead in God?  That is the central question of &quot;An Echo in the Darkness.&quot;<br />This central question makes &quot;An Echo in the Darkness&quot; much more introspective than &quot;Voice in the Wind&quot;.  Readers who enjoyed the excitement and action of Rome's bread and circuses in Volume 1, will be disappointed to find that the conflict of Volume 2 is more of an internal nature.  Instead of gladiators and lions and battles in the arena, Rivers focuses more on the thoughts and inner battles of the heart, as Marcus and Julia search for peace and meaning in their lives.  Rivers demonstrates that she is as skilful at portraying inner conflict as she is at portraying outer conflict, displaying a remarkable ability to convey and describe human emotions, feelings and struggles.<br />In contrast to the emptiness experienced by Marcus and Julia, is the fullness and joy experienced by Hadassah (you thought she was dead didn't you?)  Her scars still testify to the &quot;mark of the lion&quot;, but beneath veils, Hadassah becomes known as Rapha, a healer who through God's power develops a miraculous ability to heal.  Hadassah proves to be instrumental in the resolution of the internal struggle for both Julia and Marcus, and in the end the lives of this three-some converge in a rather remarkable way.<br />Sad to say, the book is riddled with theological errors or questionable ideas.  The notion of miraculous healing (as worked by Hadassah) is highly questionable - certainly it took place during the generation of the apostles, but it is doubtful whether it extended beyond the apostles themselves or beyond their time.  The unique appearance of &quot;Paracletos&quot; and direct revelations from God (p.295 &amp; p.299) are hardly credible in an era when the church was established and God revealed Himself almost exclusively through apostles, prophets, and the written writings.  This is a particularly unfortunate weakness because the Paracletos incident functions as a turning point in Marcus' life.  There are also difficulties surrounding Marcus baptism (p.301) - was it administered by an office-bearer, and was the extent of his confession and understanding of Christ sufficient for this? - later events seem to prove the contrary.  And of course Rivers' concept of accepting Jesus into your heart (p.101,302, 412) and the notion that every one is precious in God's sight (p. 101,273)  is typical of Arminian theology.  I wonder whether her idea that lost sinners hunger for living water from birth (p.306, 375) sufficiently takes into account the total corruption of the lost human conditions where sinners do not hunger for God but rather hunger for sinful passions (Rom. 1).  The function and importance of the revealed and written Word and the church community did not in my opinion play a sufficient role in the novel.  What's more, love and forgiveness is presented as a Christian duty independent of repentance (p.136), whereas Scripture suggests that repentance functions as an important pre-requisite for forgiveness and reconciliation.  The notion that Abram's obedience in sacrificing Isaac made his descendants the chosen people (p.119) flatly contradicts Scripture which says it was God's mercy alone (eg Deut 9:1-6).  And whether prayers to Jesus (p.132) instead of to the Father can be defended as a Scriptural practice is highly debatable.  Another major concern is Hadassah's character - it's not surprising that so many readers admire her faith - because it's hardly believable.  Stating for example that she has not one particle of vanity in her (p.138) belittles the truth of Romans 7 - that even believers who have the Spirit still have an evil nature against which they must struggle daily.  I fear that Hadassah's character could thus be discouraging to Christians because it presents as a model an ideal that they cannot possibly reach in their personal lives.<br />There are literary flaws too.  The amount of coincidence it takes to integrate the lives of Hadassah, Marcus and Julia at the end is disappointing.  Also suspiciously coincidental is the amount of people who become Christians - it seems rather disproportionate to the real world, since the central characters of our lives do not all become Christian.  This makes the ending rather too happy and optimistic, in contrast to the ending of &quot;Voice in the Wind&quot; which was much more plausible - and so much more powerful.<br />&quot;An Echo in the Darkness&quot; is in the end a rather inferior effort when compared to &quot;A Voice in the Wind&quot;.  The picture of the emptiness of human life without God is certainly a redeeming quality.  But unfortunately, it's not enough to overcome the many weaknesses and make this book as good as the first.he notion that Abram's obedience in sacrificing Isaac made his descendants the chosen people (p.119) flatly contradicts Scripture which says it was God's mercy alone (eg Deut 9:1-6).

In this second volume of his &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot; series, Stephen Lawhead continues the story begun in &quot;Taliesin&quot; by telling the tale of Merlin, a remarkable warrior, king, bard, and prophet.  Lawhead recounts his rise to kingship, his subsequent fall, and finally his important role as counsellor to kings.<br />The story focuses on a time of great change in early Britain, as independent kingdoms under Roman rule vanish and become united under one High King.  The transition from individual local kingdoms to one great kingdom under a great king remarkably parallels a similar transition in the Bible: from the anarchy and chaos of the Judges, to the unified rule under the Kings Saul and David.  Merlin's role is much like that of the Biblical Samuel: the figure who ushers in this transition by his prophecies, wisdom and counsel.  The parallels don't end there - for like Israel, early Britain is portrayed as a time of prophets (the druids), priests (the Roman Catholics) and kings.<br />The world of upheaval in which Merlin lives is characterized by trials, tragedy and triumphs.  Much like &quot;Taliesin&quot;, the reader is treated to a vast array of human emotions described in most vivid details - from utter joy to utmost sorrow - and is subsequently tossed from the pinnacles of happiness to the pits of despair.  But Lawhead does not delight in dragging his readers through gory details of bloodshed and death - in fact killing for revenge alone is presented as murder (p.314-5).  Bloodshed for the sake of justice and truth has a clear purpose: the way is being paved to the &quot;Kingdom of Summer&quot; ruled by King Arthur where justice, truth and right will be defended and maintained (p.108).  One of Arthur's predecessor's (Aurelius) must bear the sword all his days as king before this is achieved (p.318).  Astute Bible readers will note here an unmistakeable parallel with the era of King David and King Solomon.<br />Yet beneath such formalistic parallels with Scriptural narratives, lies a solid Biblical death.  The foundation of any successful kingdom is clearly recognized and acknowledged: faith in the one true God and His Son Jesus Christ (p.113-4).  Once again, Lawhead's Christian perspective shines through beautifully.  Unlike much Christian fiction, it is not always obvious nor oppressive - but nor is it superficial.  The conflict between good and evil, the powers of light and darkness is always sharply defined, and mirrors the conflict between God and Satan.  Success is presented as possible only with God's help and His blessing.<br />But &quot;Merlin&quot; also raised the questions that were evoked by &quot;Taliesin&quot;. Why is Christianity is identified with Roman Catholicism, with its focus on holy places and objects, and materialistic view of the mass (p.112)?  And does Lawhead have an overly optimistic view of Celtic religion, and does he leave room for Christians to use the occult?  His assessment of the occultic and ancient rituals of the pagans does not appear harsh enough, since he appears to view it as a mild form of the truth (&quot;In every age there is some good&quot; p.191), and that the occultic powers can be harnessed by the Christian prophet for good - Merlin being a case in point.  This is confirmed by his description of Lughnasadh, as being a time where &quot;the veil between the Otherworld and this worlds-realm grows thin and allows the initiated a glimpse of what was, or will be.&quot; (p.397).  Whether such a syncretism of paganism and Christianity is possible is highly debatable, unless of course Lawhead is intending to present Britain as a model of the pre-Christian era (the time of judges and kings?) prior to the cessation of prophecy and prior to the completion of the canon of Scripture.  But as it is, leaving the door open to a favorable view of occultic activities left me distinctly uncomfortable.<br />But don't let this decrease your appetite for Merlin.  It's a gripping and satisfying tale, one that simultaneously evokes emotions, stimulates imagination, and causes reflection.  The first person point of view is utilized superbly to present Merlin as thoroughly real man with flaws and failures as well as strengths and successes.  Like &quot;Taliesin&quot;, &quot;Merlin&quot; showcases Lawhead's myriad of talents in a delightful mix of romance, adventure, emotion, faith and even poetry.  The Christian imagery is subtle and profound, and once again Lawhead has produced a fantasy gem that is greatly superior to most contemporary Christian fiction.isfying tale, one that simultaneously evokes emotions, stimulates imagination, and causes reflection.

This is a very sad novel.  Which is precisely the point.  Its aim is not to give us a warm fuzzy feeling, but to make us recoil over the horrors of abortion, feel ashamed, and motivate us to do something about it.<br />As a pro-life activist, DeParrie is well qualified to write a book like this.  As he notes in the after-word &quot;This story is not really fiction.  I have merely compiled true stories from within the pro-life movement.&quot;  What this brilliant work of fiction does is convey the truth - a horrible truth about abortion.  It is a story well-researched, and well-written.<br />By means of several intertwining plot-lines, DeParrie successfully and comprehensively covers nearly all the important issues relating to abortion, including the emotional and psychological trauma suffered by post-abortion mothers, the legal history of abortion, the judicial and legal bias and corruption against the pro-life movement, the selfish motivation that frequently accompanies abortion, the lies advanced by the pro-choice (make that: pro-abortion) movement.  Yet DeParrie is fair to both sides of the debate - he first pictures the situation from a pro-choice perspective and initially portrays the pro-life movement as anti-abortionist radicals.  Throughout the novel he presents all the arguments raised by the pro-choice movement, and lets them speak for themselves with their own reasoning.<br />But in the end, these arguments are shown to be what they really are: selfish, and hollow, and merely covering up the unavoidable truth that abortion is murder.  DeParrie heightens his point with a unique authorial device of describing part of the story from the perspective of the newly conceived baby.<br />As a reader, you may not find yourself completely agreeing with DeParrie on all accounts, but you are sure to gain respect for his view-point.  For instance, if you do not already agree with DeParrie's defence of civil disobedience by form of peaceful protest will certainly make you rethink your position on this controversial matter.  One criticism I do have to make is DeParrie's description of a protester's &quot;Jesus loves you&quot; sign, which seems entirely inconsistent with the message on the back cover of the book &quot;The wrath of God is coming.&quot;  It seems to me that the message of the cover is in this case correct - there is no love for those who reject Jesus, and the wrath of God remains on all those who do not repent from their sins, including the sins of abortion (Jn 3:36).<br />In the end we are left with the grisly facts that will bring tears to your eyes.  The grisly content is certainly suitable for mature readers only, but all who regard themselves as mature will greatly benefit by reading it.  In such a novel, there can be no happy ending - not for the unborn babies, nor for the pro-life protesters.  And in the end, there is no happy ending - and a good thing too, because it would only have softened the author's terrible message, a message that needs no softening because it is a message of truth.

In this best-selling historical novel, L'Amour plots an epic adventure story with furious action and intrigue.  He departs from his renowned Western setting in order to paint a story on the rich canvas of Medieval Europe.  The colorful backdrop of characters includes Goths, Persians, Greeks, Normans, Jews, Syrians, Slavs, Arabas, Franks, Moors, Saxons and Englanders, with a myriad of vocations (artisans, cobblers, weavers, potters, armorers and innkeepers), from a variety of classes, including nobility (barons, lords, and clergymen) ruffians and vagabonds (archers, swordsman) and performers (jugglers, magicians and acrobats).  The scope of this novel is enormous, and covers territory including Spain, France, Germany, Italy and Turkey.<br />The main character is Kerbouchard, who meets action a plenty as he seeks to avenge the death of his mother and rescue his captured father.  Kerbouchard's aim is to find his father, a fortune and a beautiful female friend, and his vast experiences give him a large measure of success on all accounts.<br />Kerbouchard is a portrayed as a warrior, lover and scholar, and it is his ability to adapt to a variety of roles that ensures his survival: from seafarer, to galley slave, to soldier, to scholar, to linguist, to vagabond, to merchant, to physician.  Brash, brazen and arrogant, he is not always loveable, but in the complex medieval world in which he is placed, it is these qualities that enable him to succeed.  The medieval era in which he lives is one where the sword speaks more than words, where fighting comes first and questions come later.  Yet from the outset, he is equipped with the maxim of an experienced man: &quot;Trust to your wits, boy, and to your good right hand.&quot; (p.2)  Kerbouchard comes to appreciate the value of both a sharp sword and a sharp mind (p.76).  One both accounts he is a rather larger-than-life hero, since his accomplishments with both sword and mind are so vast as to defy the imagination.<br />It is especially to the latter that Kerbouchard devotes his attention, convinced that &quot;knowledge might be power, but it was also the key to survival.&quot;  He rejects both Christianity and the Moslem religion, the dominant religions of the day, in favor of an open quest for truth, since knowledge and learning are better than money or health and strength (p.66).  Here L'Amour glorifies the &quot;spirit of inquiry&quot; and thirst for learning, as Kerbouchard hungrily pursues knowledge of physics, astronomy, geography, philosophy, mathematics, astrology, medicine, logic, religion, politics, law, natural sciences, necromancy, drama, poetry, military tactics, navigation, history, and chemistry.<br />Does &quot;The Walking Drum&quot; have any deeper significance beyond a racing plot set on a rich historical tapestry?  Consider this: Is Kerbouchard a mouthpiece for L'Amour when he confesses his paganism, and quest for truth over against the great institutions of learning, when he says &quot;I have reverence for all who ask questions and seek honest answers... I suspect all who claim to have THE truth&quot; (p.245) and &quot;dogma is invariably wrong, as knowledge is always in a state of transition.&quot; (p.255)?  Certainly his espousal of the philosophy of self-determination is typical L'Amour: &quot;Up to a point a man's life is shaped by environment, heredity, and movements and changes in the world about him; then there comes a time when it lies within his grasp to shape the clay of his life into the sort of thing he wishes to be.  Only the weak blame parents, their race, their times, lack of good fortune, or the quirks of fate.  Everyone has it within his power to say, this I am today, that I shall be tomorrow.  The wish, however, must be implemented by deeds.&quot; (p.373)<br />Certainly this novel does raise questions about the truth of such a philosophy, as well as the importance of a personal quest for learning.  One does not have to agree with Kerbouchard to findvalue in the discussion of these philosophical questions.  But ultimately this book is not a book about philosophy - it's a historical novel.  L'Amour is convinced that too little attention is given in Western society to the significant contribution of the Chinese, Indian and Moslem world to our civilization, and he wishes to correct this by introducing readers to a more balanced history of this era by means of a historical novel.  The dark ages may have been dark for Western Europe, but it is L'Amour's contention that in the Moslem world of the East it was time of prosperity and growth.<br />There can be little doubt that L'Amour succeeds in achieving this aim.  But even where he doesn't, there is no doubt that he's made his own unique and satisfying contribution to the piles of enjoyable adventure novels.  If you're looking for depth or for perceptive insights about human nature, you won't find it in &quot;The Walking Drum.&quot;  This is not literature.

Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure (The 25th Anniversary Edition)	Books	4	14	15	N	N	Unconventional look at the conventional romantic adventure.	This 1973 book is fast becoming a classic, and the movie version has done much to popularize it.  Goldman takes the conventional tale of romantic adventure featuring a kidnapped princess who is rescued by a gallant knight.  However, Goldman departs from the stereotypical mould of the romantic adventure by exaggerating the conventional roles to the point where the story evolves from a serious tale of adventure into a farcical spoof.  It is not so much a contemporary version of the Sir Walter Scott type adventure as it is an exaggerated version.  The delicious and distorted blend of the lofty and the mundane that Goldman serves up results in a comical buffoonery.  After all, who ever heard of a princess called &quot;Buttercup&quot;, a prince called &quot;Humperdinck&quot; and a hero (appropriately just a farm boy) called &quot;Westley&quot;?  And who ever heard of countries that go by the names of currencies like &quot;Florin&quot; and &quot;Guilder&quot;?  And who ever heard of pirates who retire?<br />Goldman heightens the farcical effect by writing under the guise of an editor who is merely abridging the supposed longer work by the early 20th century writer S. Morgenstern (an approach similar to that later used by Michael Crichton in &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;).  Of course Morgenstern is entirely a figment of Goldman's imagination and a fictional creation, as is evident from the numerous contemporary jokes found throughout which clearly originate from Goldman, and not an older Morgenstern.  This is in fact an ingenious literary device that successfully enables Goldman to get outside the story and give his own pithy commentary about the action.  The fact that it has fooled some readers to unsuccessfully endeavour to discover more about the mysterious Morgenstern can only serve as a tribute to the effectiveness of this literary device!<br />The story itself features an evil villain (Humperdinck), a beautiful princess (Buttercup), and the humble hero (Westley).  Westley needs to overcome the legendary Cliffs of Insanity and the dreaded Fire Swamp with its renowned R.O.U.S.s (Rodents of Unusual Size).  In what appears to be a farcical version of the three musketeers, he must also master the hired hands of his adversary, the infamous &quot;Sicilian Crowd&quot;, composed of the Turk Fezzik (a huge idiot whose contribution is his strength), the Spaniard Inigo (a tall athlete whose contribution is his sword), and the Sicilian Vizzini (a thin leader whose contribution is his brains).  Just so you can picture this farcical trio accurately, imagine Fezzik as a bulk who started shaving in Grade 1, Inigo as a madman who has devoted only 72,000 hours to prepare for a single fencing battle with his father's murderer, and Vizzini as a criminal mastermind who defies anything that doesn't fit with his logic as &quot;inconceivable.&quot;<br />Of course the mixture of strength, sword and brains doesn't faze our hero, and after he successfully overcomes the skill tests of strength, swordmanship, and brains, some of the Sicilian Crowd become his personal allies in the quest against Humperdinck.  Ultimately, they are the ones who rescue him from death by forcing a resurrection pill (you haven't heard of those either, have you?) down his throat, and help him rescue Buttercup and ride off into the sunset with her on four white horses.  But this isn't a typical adventure-romance, remember, so of course Goldman presents an alternative ending where there is no sunset, and the hapless hero is forever chased by the villains.<br />The movie version sticks very close to the book, and fans of the movie will especially enjoy this book.  It is marred by a few instances of blasphemy, and the glorification of Inigo's obsession with revenge.  But as a farce on the traditional romantic adventure, this book can be enjoyed by anyone with a sense of humor, and a vague awareness of the literary conventions that Goldman is mocking.  As Goldman describes it: &quot;Fencing.  Fighting.  Torture.  Poison.  True love.  Hate.  Revenge.  Giants.  Hunters.  Bad men.  Good men.  Beautifulest ladies.  Snakes.  Spiders.  Beasts of all natures and descriptions.  Pain.  Death.  Brave men.  Coward men.  Strongest men.  Chases.  Escapes.  Lies.  Truths.  Passion.  Miracles.&quot;  Take these ingredients, mix well with a grain of salt, a sense of humor, and a strong measure of exaggeration and farce, and you have &quot;The Princess Bride.&quot;  It's the recipe for success, and this book proves it.encing.

US	51067904	R2C30A2ZIJBIU6	1556616074	480068294	Dreamers (Legacies of the Ancient River No. 1) (Book 1)	Books	3	37	44	N	N	Biblical fiction? - more fictional than Biblical!	&quot;Dreamers&quot; is the first volume of a trilogy of books based on the life of Joseph.  But the Biblical story-line is only a starting-point for Hunt, as she weaves the Scriptural account with various fictional characters and events to make a wonderful story.  &quot;Dreamers&quot; describes Joseph being brought to Egypt as a slave, his rise to power in Potiphar's household, his imprisonment after being unjustly accused of adultery, and his subsequent rise to the second-highest in command in Egypt.  The book can also be read as the story of the fictional Tuya, Joseph's fellow slave and lover.  What can you expect from this book?<br />Weaknesses - the Biblical part.<br />1. The Egyptian chronology is inaccurate.  Although there is little consensus concerning precise dates for Egyptian chronology, most scholars agree that the Exodus occurred some time during the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom.  The pharaohs described by Hunt (Thutmosis III, Amenhotep II, Thutmosis IV, and Amenhotep III) are certainly historical figures, but it is more likely that these were the pharaohs from around the time of the Exodus, 400 years later.  If traditional Egyptian chronology is correct, Joseph rose to prominence in Egypt hundreds of years prior to the rise of the figures portrayed in &quot;Dreamers.&quot; Hunt could at least have acknowledged that she was following a revisionist Egyptian chronology that departs from the scholarly consensus.<br />2. Embellishment of the Biblical narrative.  No doubt Hunt would be the first to remind us that her novels are not a speculative picture of what might have happened to Joseph, but are rather a fictional account.  Certain aspects of the story line are clearly inventions of the author (e.g. specific injuries suffered by Joseph in the pit, his romance with Tuya, Potiphar's impotence and suicide, other revelatory dreams).  I felt distinctly uncomfortable with the idea of a fictional embellishment of Scriptural truth, and personally question the legitimacy of &quot;Biblical fiction&quot; a genre.<br />3. Weak theology.  The romance between Joseph and Tuya is central to the novel, but absent from Scripture.  Hunt's constant focus on romance and love as a feeling is more a reflection of our modern secular time than of Scripture.  Many readers may enjoy this aspect, but I find it sad that a writer needs to borrow secular concepts from our contemporary pagan culture to make Biblical fiction effective.  Hunt departs even further from the Bible by having Joseph unashamedly fall in love with and pledge to marry his fellow slave, who does at this time not share his belief in the invisible and true God.  Joseph's behaviour in this regard is a sharp departure from that of his father Jacob and grandfather Isaac, who both went to great lengths to ensure that their wives were from a believing family.  Hunt presents Joseph as unwavering in his desire to obey God, but she plainly ignores a clear command found throughout Scripture and plainly evident also in the life of Joseph's ancestors: that marrying an unbeliever is disobedience to God.<br />4. Religious pluralism. By attributing prophetic and miraculous powers to the Egyptian gods (e.g. an Egyptian god enables his pagan priestess to prophesy Joseph's rise to power p.186, and an Egyptian god speaks to the Egyptian prince and promises to make him king p.249), Hunt gives the impression that she departs from monotheism by regarding El Shaddai the invisible God as merely higher and better than other gods.  Hunt's picture is different than that found in Scripture, where other gods are portrayed as useless and non-existent (Isaiah 44:6-20).  Certainly the Bible does speak of demonic powers that are at work behind the powerless gods of wood and stone, but this is not the way Hunt presents it.<br />Strengths - the fictional part.<br />1. Superb story-telling.  Despite the fact that most readers are already familiar with the story of Joseph, the reader is not hampered by a predictable plot.  Even readers familiar with the Bible (and thus know the basic outcome), will find this novel enthralling.  Hunt's story-telling abilities shine through constantly, resulting in a gripping and powerful story that you will find hard to put down.<br />2. Magnificent setting.  The Egyptian culture is portrayed in rich and vivid colours, complete with its landscape, religion, social customs and beliefs.  Reading this books is a wonderful way to obtain a picture of life in Egypt, and your knowledge and understanding of ancient Egypt will grow without ever you getting the idea that you are on the receiving end of a dry lecture.  Even the metaphors and similes used by Hunt are appropriately Egyptian, and all aspects of the book have an Egyptian flavour - an altogether remarkable achievement!<br />Should you buy or read this book?  Do not expect a faithful representation of Joseph's life.  If you feel uncomfortable with the idea of Biblical fiction, then reading this book will leave you with a nagging dissatisfaction.  But if you are prepared to try to overlook the fact that this book is based on a Biblical story-line and read it as an entirely fictional work, you will find it a most thrilling and enjoyable read.  I am not eager to rush out and read the other books of this series, but Hunt's story-telling abilities have whetted my appetite for sampling some of her other contributions to the Christian fiction genre.  I am optimistic that these other efforts will be more satisfying than the Biblical fiction of &quot;Dreamers.&quot;edictable plot.

Don't expect blazing action, because the conflict is primarily internal and emotional, centring around the human relationships between three key players in the town.  First there's the ambitious assistant mayor, Connie Wilkes. Then there's her enigmatic 83 year-old uncle Poppa Joe, a grand old hilly-billy type who contracts cancer.  And finally there's the town's new doctor, Nathan Reynolds, a brilliant and dedicated doctor described as &quot;the most irascible, difficult, stubborn, domineering, extraordinarily infuriating individual you have ever met.&quot; (p.133).  The bulk of the novel describes the interplay of feelings and emotions as Poppa Joe is faced with the eternal life that follows death, and Nathan Reynolds is faced with the new life of a Christian.<br />I cannot wholeheartedly endorse Bunn's theology, such as his commitment to Arminianism (p.221-2), and his surprising use of veiled blasphemy (p.8, 160).  The idea of &quot;carrying something good&quot; into heaven to set before God's throne (p.175) had me especially puzzled - it certainly gives the impression that our works somehow earn merit before God, although it may not be Bunn's intention to convey this.  But especially weak is the portrayal of conversion.  Bunn glamorizes the beginning of faith, which forms the novel's climax (e.g. Nathan's baptism p.264-5), resulting in an overly optimistic conclusion that downplays the struggles and sorrows experienced in a life of faith.  Nor was I fully satisfied with the source and nature of the change experienced in Nathan's life.  The &quot;enemy&quot; is not portrayed as sin and Satan, but the bad experiences of the past and sorrowful sicknesses of the present.  Consequently, the &quot;solution&quot; is simply a calming &quot;presence&quot; (pp. 217-222), and being a Christian is presented as experiencing a warm fuzzy feeling.  But this misses the heart of the gospel - where the real problem is sin, and the real solution is the justifying and sanctifying work of Christ in overcoming sin. Sadly, it seemed to me the work of Jesus Christ was short-changed with a superficial gospel of warm feelings.<br />But don't let these weaknesses prevent you from reading this book.  The novel has much to recommend it, not least the beautiful hardcover presentation, attractive dust-cover, quality paper, and lovely pencil illustrations.  Bunn beautifully conveys the magnificent way in which God reveals himself in creation (pp. 91-2), a theme strongly reminiscent of Psalm 19.  But what I particularly enjoyed about this novel is that it has none of the sappy sentimentalism that normally characterizes Christmas novels.  It deals with the hard facts of life, and is often a very moving story.  Nathan Reynolds' initial antagonism is somewhat unrealistic, but aside from that Bunn relates very real feelings and emotions.  The significance of life and death is an important theme, as is evidenced by the quotation of Psalm 90:12 that prefaces the book - &quot;So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.&quot;  Here the character of Poppa Joe is presented as a shining example - a mountain man with simple faith.  Bunn beautifully depicts the simple faith of a solid believer who is faced with serious struggles - yet without resorting to an unrealistic and superficial one-dimensional experience of joy that some Christian novelists are guilty of depicting.<br />Despite its flaws, this book is thus still a very worthwhile read, far superior to the shallowness of most contemporary evangelical fiction offerings. Especially for someone struggling with a difficult illness or trial it would make a wonderful gift.  Our days are often difficult, but with the &quot;heart of wisdom&quot; of Psalm 90, we can carry on in faith and hope.the heart of the gospel - where the real problem is sin, and the real solution is the justifying and sanctifying work of Christ in overcoming sin.

US	51067904	RTEHKSA5XAIAJ	0812511816	456114433	The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time, Book 1)	Books	4	45	54	N	N	Tolkien meets Taoism.	&quot;The Eye of the World&quot; is the introductory volume of the mammoth and immensely popular &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series.  It lays the foundation to the series by introducing us to three young men who are central characters in the great and cosmic conflict against evil, describing their difficult and dangerous journey to the Eye of the World, constantly facing the perils and powers of magical abilities wielded by friends and foes.  The series bears the unmistakable imprint of two main influences.<br />1. The worldview of Tolkien.<br />Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; was the ground-breaking fantasy that firmly established the future direction of this genre.  His originality and imagination pioneered the structures of the fantasy playing field within which Jordan works. Although Jordan's characterization, description, and use of language rarely equals that of Tolkien, many of his concepts and ideas (notably &quot;The Dark Lord&quot; and his &quot;black riders&quot;) will be recognizable, and this epic fantasy with its cosmic conflict is superior to most other modern efforts in the genre.<br />Like Tolkien, Jordan's characterization and conflict parallels much found in the Christian Bible.  Underneath the trappings of fantasy, &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; is actually a very religious book.  Aside from the central struggle between good and evil, there are many unmistakable Biblical parallels and allusions, such as the idea of the tree of life, and the multitude of prayers to &quot;Light&quot;.  One only has to substitute the constant references to &quot;Light&quot; with &quot;God&quot; and the point is already made.  In contrast to the Creator and the &quot;Light&quot;, is the Dark One, &quot;Shai'tan&quot;.  Is it a coincidence that this sounds like the Biblical &quot;Satan&quot;?  &quot;Shai'tan&quot; shares many other titles with his Biblical namesake, notably the &quot;Father of Lies&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Grave.&quot;  And just as the fallen Satan and his angels of the Bible were destined by God to be bound in &quot;Sheol&quot; or realm of the grave, so Shai'tan and his followers (&quot;the Forsaken&quot;) are bound in &quot;Shayol Ghol.&quot;  Jordan closely mirrors the eschatology of the Biblical Revelation, where Satan is set free from his prison, leading to a final cosmic battle between good and evil that ends the world.  There is even a Messianic Christ figure - &quot;the Light in the flesh&quot; (p.779 ) - upon whom the hopes of the world rest, and like Jesus, Rand is tempted by Shai'tan to receive great power by kneeling before him.  Jordan plainly borrows from Tolkien, and from the source that inspired Tolkien's cosmic conflict - the Bible.<br />But this is not to say that Jordan is not original.  Quite the opposite: he is far from a Tolkien carbon copy!  Within the contours of a Tolkien-style genre of fantasy, he has created his own medieval type world, with his own conflicts and cast of characters.  &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; has captured the hearts and imaginations of readers by its own strengths, not merely strengths borrowed from Tolkien.  Although he rarely matches the epic grandeur and heroic tone of Tolkien's classic, Jordan in fact even surpasses Tolkien in suspense and action.<br />2. The worldview of Taoism.<br />Yet Jordan does not slavishly follow Tolkien's Christian worldview, but significantly departs from it by strongly incorporating elements of New Age Eastern thinking, particularly Taoist religion and philosophy.  In contrast to Tolkien and the Bible, where history is portrayed as linear, progressing towards a final goal, the history portrayed in &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; is circular, repetitive, and without end.  Jordan describes history as a &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; (a symbol for eternity) which turns, and ultimately repeats itself.  Not surprisingly, this history features reincarnation.  At the heart of the wheel of history is the &quot;True Source&quot; of power,consisting of equal male and female halves (saidin and saidar).  This is clearly the Taoist yin-yang (Taiji) concept dressed in new clothing.  Jordan's universe is actually very pagan in character, because the characters do not find success and salvation by reaching to God, but to the magical powers of this &quot;True Source.&quot;  Jordan's fantastic universe is governed not by the Creator, but by the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;, which leaves little room for the exercise of free will, since history is destined to repeat itself, and events are largely determined by the previous revolution of the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;.  The Creator makes the wheel, but then it is the &quot;Pattern&quot; which weaves - &quot;Everything is part of the pattern.  We cannot pick or choose.&quot; (p.143).  &quot;It will be as the wheel weaves.&quot; (p.422).  It is the Deistic, deterministic, circular universe of Taoism.<br />But don't let the underlying philosophy behind the universe of the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; scare you.  I found it stimulating, particularly the notion that all of history and even my individual life is part of a grand pattern, woven by the hand of an unseen Creator.  But &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; is not primarily a book about philosophy, but an exciting story.  Although I do not share much of the thinking behind the implicit world-view of the &quot;Wheel of Time,&quot; this did not prevent me from enjoying the book as an engrossing story.  Jordan has created a series that lacks Tolkien's grandeur, but is more readable.  Admittedly, the first hundred pages are somewhat difficult to read, because you are introduced to a new world, with new characters, creatures, and conflicts.  But once this world becomes familiar, you will find it completely captivating.  The action and suspense rarely lets up, and you will find it hard to put this book down.  One could argue that the ending is somewhat rushed, but on the whole, these hundreds of pages are sure to keep you constantly surprised and satisfied.  &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; absolutely deserves its place as one of the best contributions to contemporary fantasy.consisting of equal male and female halves (saidin and saidar).

Brian Jacques' &quot;Redwall&quot; series, starring hero Matthias mouse, has made him a renowned children's story-teller.  &quot;Redwall&quot; is the book that started it all, and introduces us to Redwall Abbey, where the Abbot is in charge of a peace-loving community of mice, who are eager to do good to all men...errr...animals.  Yes, there are no humans in this fantasy world of furry friends and foes - only animals: mice, sparrows, badgers, squirrels, and of course evil rats, stoats, ferrets, foxes, and snakes - each with its own unique characteristics and contribution to make to this fantasy world.<br />Conflict arises when Redwall Abbey is threatened by the notorious Cluny the Scourge, an evil one-eyed rat, with his band of equally nasty critters who want to claim Redwall as their own.  The Redwall creatures need to resort to desperate measures to defend their territory, but ultimately it is the Matthias mouse who comes to the rescue, after discovering the famous sword of his hero, Martin the Warrior, and emulating his feats.<br />Certainly there are weaknesses.  Despite the clearly religious setting of the Abbey, it never becomes clear what kind of religion this is, and it never really functions in the story-line.  There is a great deal of hellish imagery used in connection with Cluny's evil army, where rats &quot;look like the devil himself&quot;, use expletives such as &quot;by Satan's whiskers&quot; and &quot;by the claws of hell thunder&quot;, and join the devil in hell when they die.  Perhaps Jacques is borrowing Christianity as a traditional image of the powers of heaven over against the powers of hell, to underline the struggle between good and evil.  Matthias mouse also has his flaws.  He is at times rather anti-authoritarian, arrogant, bad-tempered and unjustifiably rude to his enemies, frequently resorting to rather horrifying name calling that hardly befits a role-model.<br />But despite this, it's not hard to see why children love this series.  The fantasy world Jacques has created is compelling, and yet not complicated like that of Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.  The good characters are loveable, the evil ones equally despicable.  The conflict between good and evil is easy to identify.  There is no lack of originality, as readers are treated to forms of brilliant military strategy that they have never dreamed about.  The creatures' creative schemes of attack and defence, and ingenious attempts to overcome the enemy are constantly charming.  There is action aplenty, suspense, humour, even a touch of romance.  And children are easily able to identify with Matthias, and join him on his journey to maturity.<br />This series does not have the makings of a classic like Tolkien's work, because it is doubtful that the appeal of this book will extend much beyond its intended readers of ages 9-12.  Adults who continue to enjoy Rowling's Harry Potter and Tolkien's Bilbo Baggins may find this book too uncomplicated and childish.  But it would be unfair to criticize Jacques too much for this, because the simplicity of the story-line is precisely what has made this series appeal so strongly to the age group it is written for, and it is this strength that lies behind its incredible success.  In the end, this book needs to be judged on its own merits - as a children's fantasy about animals.  As such it is unquestionably successful, and deservedly so.

If the &quot;happily ever after&quot; at the end of fairy tales never left you completely satisfied, then this is the book for you.  In &quot;Enchantment&quot;, Orson Scott Card takes you beyond the &quot;happily ever after&quot; of the traditional story of Sleeping Beauty.  The first few chapters introduce Ivan, a brilliant Russian graduate student living in America, and preparing to write a dissertation about Russian fairy tales.  Just when Card's realism had me convinced that this could be a true story, Ivan stumbles across the sleeping princess Katerina, and awakes her with his kiss.  But don't think that Card is just borrowing a fairy tale, because the end of the traditional story of Sleeping Beauty is merely the beginning of Card's tale!  Ivan quickly discovers that kissing a princess doesn't result in living happily ever after, as he travels back in time to Katerina's world, and becomes involved with her in an epic struggle to defend the kingdom of her father over against the wannabe ruler, the witch Baba Yaga.  In the course of this struggle, Ivan and Katerina travel to worlds past and present.  This leads to some delightfully cultural comedy, where ninth century Russians get to use gunpowder and molotov cocktails and also have the rare privilege of seeing a 747 jumbo jet enter their world well ahead of its time.  Card's story-telling is superb, and his fantastic blend of reality and magic, past and present, is wonderfully entertaining.  There is constant suspense, romance, adventure and humour.<br />But as usual, Card does much more than just tell a good story.  His special attention to inner thoughts and struggles and the psychology of human relationships is masterful.  In the course of telling his fairy tale, he shares numerous philosophical thoughts about literary theory, psychology, and religion. The clash between cultures achieves more than just comedy, but provides deep insights about the chasm between times, cultures, and religions (especially Judaism and Christianity - both of which are somewhat unfairly portrayed as mere outward rituals entered upon by circumcision or baptism).  Card demonstrates that it is possible for two very different individuals from different times and cultures to make a new beginning together in a marriage, although this meeting of cultures cannot occur without both gaining and losing something at the same time.<br />Especially thought provoking is the fact that Card uses a fairy tale to show that reality is not like the high fantasy of fairy tales, because in the real world that there is no such thing as living happily ever.  Is Card satirizing the impossibly high ideals of beauty and happiness that fairy tales normally offer?  I quickly found myself laughing at Card's harsh fantasy world, because it was one I recognized: the real world, my world, which in reality is often cold and harsh.  We quickly discover that kissing a beautiful princess in the real world is not all it is made out to be.  So we can identify with Ivan the naked prince - his shock at the harsh reality of a fairy tale come true (p.90) is our shock at the harsh reality of life.<br />Perhaps to heighten the effect of a fairy tale that reflects reality rather than fantasy, Card frequently resorts to crude language, and sexually explicit details.  Also the portrayal of the witch Baba Yaga and her sidekick Bear was at times unnecessarily morbid.  It is undeniable that this contributes to the effect of bringing the fantasy to cold hard earth, but personally I found it unnecessary to go so far in order to create the effect he wanted, and from Card (a Mormon) rather surprising and unexpected.  I find it a shame that by employing such language and giving attention to such crude details, Card has made this book suitable only for mature and discerning readers, and made it inappropriate even for older children.<br />Card also uses the culture contrast between modernity and myth, past and present to criticize contemporary culture.  Are Card's comments about the lack of respect for authority and the change in roles between husbands and wives (p.206) an implicit criticism of Western society?  And is Ivan a mouthpiece for Card when he makes the observation that contemporary culture focuses on having itself remembered, whereas past culture focuses more on surviving (p.139)?  And is the disappointing and harsh fantasy world that first promised so much intended to be a mirror image of life in the USA, which Ivan's Russian immigrant family also found disappointing (p.144)?<br />These and more questions will amuse you for hours.  &quot;Enchantment&quot; is certainly a wonderful marriage of fantasy and reality, past and present, magic and science, pleasure and philosophy.  The crude details do leave a bit of a bad aftertaste, but like Ivan and Katerina's marriage, this marriage of modernity and myth in the end proves to be most successful and satisfyinge.

In this classic, Baum describes the tale of poor Dorothy, who is hurled by a cyclone away from her uncle and aunt in Kansas into a strange and magical world of wizards and witches.  Fortunately Dorothy has the help of several companions that she meets in this new world - a stuffed scarecrow who wants brains, a tin woodsman who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who wants courage.  Together with Dorothy - who wants a return trip to Kansas - they travel to the emerald city where Oz is wizard, to ask him to make their wishes come true.  Their journey is fraught with adventures, and when they finally meet Oz they discover a terrible truth, that leads them into even more challenges and adventures.  The magical fantasy of this tale has pleased readers of all ages for a century, and it's not hard to see why.  Baum spins a wonderfully enchanting tale that includes wicked witches, flying monkeys, talking mice, and other fantastic creatures.<br />Is this book more than just a fantasy thrill?  Some literary critics have proposed that Baum - a strong believer in individualism and self-confidence - is working with themes about self-esteem and self-reliance.  This is quite plausible, especially considering that the brains, heart and courage sought by the scarecrow, woodsman and lion are abilities that they clearly already possess - they just need to recognize them and use them.  And Dorothy herself discovers that when the wizard can't help her, she must and can rely on herself.  Other literary critics have claimed that &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; needs to be read as an elaborate political allegory where the various characters represent various social classes and financial structures - a not impossible suggestion, but one that's somewhat difficult to defend.  Ultimately, however, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is best enjoyed as a wonderful story.  That doesn't mean it is any less of a contribution to English literature, because when appreciated as a brilliant story, you're sure to come back to it again and again, as are your children and grandchildren.  It's precisely this universal appeal that makes &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; a true classic.come back to it again and again, as are your children and grandchildren.

If you were the kind of child who always asked the &quot;why?&quot; question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book.  In &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down.  With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems.  Here's a small taste:<br />&quot;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&quot; said the Cat.  &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot;  &quot;It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way.  &quot;I thought it would,&quot; said the Cat, and vanished again.<br />&quot;they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M - &quot; &quot;Why with an M?&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why not?&quot; said the March Hare.<br />If you find this kind of surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's &quot;Wonderland&quot;.  You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of &quot;Off with his head.&quot;  &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy.  What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies.  Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults.  A &quot;classic&quot; is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;<br />Is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; all nonsense?  I don't think so.  Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense.  He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted.  Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time.  Don't be satisfied with a movie edition or simplified version of Alice - nothing is as enjoyable as the original!

Louis L'Amour is a giant when it comes to Westerns, and this best-selling historical novel shows why.  The hero is Johannes Verne, left to die in the desert as a young boy by his hateful grandfather.  L'Amour chronicles Johannes' growth from a naive child into a mature and experienced adventurer whose survival requires him to overcome both murderous enemies and rugged wilderness territory. Action, suspense and intrigue are rarely in short supply.  In the course of the action, L'Amour offers delightful descriptions of the desert scenery, and of the small town life of early Los Angeles in a time of rapid transition and growth.<br /> &quot;The Lonesome Gods&quot; is not without flaws.  The inflated dialogue at times takes on an unrealistic dry sermonizing tone, with one instance of uninterrupted three page monologue (p.108-111).  The action is at times rather oddly broken by chapter breaks.  The idea of the &quot;lonesome gods&quot; was important enough to make the title, and although is briefly explained as the spirits of the ancient ones who are lonely gods without worshipers (p.54,204,213,309,341,397), it is never fully developed, entirely pagan and hardly believable.  Personally I do not share L'Amour's use of blasphemy (p.93), his endorsement of a multi-million-year-old earth (p.76), and his personal existentialist philosophy of self-determination where one's destiny is completely in one's own hands (p.265,341) and that &quot;we're nothing until we make ourselves something.&quot; (p.242).  Death may be standard fare in most Westerns, but that still does not excuse the twenty corpses littered over the pages, sadly giving the appearance that human life is cheap, and minimizing the tragedy of loss.<br />But the strengths of this novel surpass its weaknesses.  It is true that L'Amour does not depart completely from the formulaic Western plot where boy meets girl, shoots some bad guys, and rides off into the sunset with his girl.  But in &quot;The Lonesome Gods&quot; L'Amour gives this formula at least some depth, which is more than can be said for most Westerns.  He works with deeper themes, such as the development of Johannes Verne's character from childhood to manhood, and the self-destruction that results from his grandfather's obsession with revenge.  To say, as California Magazine is quoted on the cover, that &quot;This is L'Amour's finest book&quot; is to say too much.  It is not literature, but it is a good light read - an absorbing and enjoyable story.  The pace of the action increases significantly towards the end, and you'll find yourself scrambling through the pages, and in the end, quite satisfied.'Amour gives this formula at least some depth, which is more than can be said for most Westerns.

Who hasn't heard of Robin Hood and his merry band of outlaws in Sherwood Forest?  In this book you meet them all - including the powerful Little John, courageous Will Scarlet, musical Allan a Dale, and sly Friar Tuck.  Howard Pyle offers what is probably the most complete and best collection of Robin Hood tales.  All the old favorites are included - Little John and his quarter-staff toppling Robin into the water, Robin winning the golden arrow at Nottingham's archery contest, and the Sheriff being outsmarted in numerous attempts to capture Robin.  But these are just the tip of the iceberg - this book is chock-full of entertaining merry adventures.<br />The medieval setting is portrayed beautifully, including the vast gulf between the upper and lower classes of society, the corruption and greed of the nobility, and the hypocrisy of the medieval Roman Catholic church where religion has degenerated to mere outward rituals.  Even the language is somewhat antiquated, which initially seems tedious, but persevere because you will soon find that this an enjoyable and essential addition that heightens the heroic atmosphere of the story.  But the medieval setting is not presented without a social commentary - Pyle shows that the unbalanced social structure inevitably resulted in the oppression of the poor and weak.  It is left to Robin Hood and his men to take justice into their own hands, and fight nobly for the cause of the downtrodden.  Such justice is accomplished in a questionable manner, because the notion of robbing the rich to help the poor implicitly endorses civil disobedience.  But the more important theme of seeking justice and maintaining truth and right is in itself a noble one.  With Robin Hood, we find ourselves wanting justice, and being prepared to make unselfish sacrifices in order to achieve it.  When justice is done, it is actually the greed and corruption of the nobility that has led to its own destruction and ruin.<br />But the real attraction of this gem are the enthralling exploits of Robin Hood and his band of merry men.  Howard Pyle presents Sherwood Forest as a rather glamorous utopian world where feasting and song abound, where it is never winter, and where the ale rarely runs dry.  Robin Hood clearly represents a form of hedonism, and in his company there is never a lack of action, adventure, or for that matter - ale.  But it's not the beer that attracts us to Robin Hood, it's rather his bravado.  There is no end to the accomplishments of muscles and mind, as he and his merry band outwit all comers by sheer physical skill in archery, wrestling, swordmanship, and quarter-staff combat, or by outsmarting them with deceit and disguise.  To our delight, Robin's brawn and brains always come out on top at the end.<br />Howard Pyle's collection of Robin Hood's merry adventures is a classic that is constantly entertaining and exciting - one that you'll want to own and read over and over!em are the enthralling exploits of Robin Hood and his band of merry men.

In his stunning five-volume &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot; series, Stephen Lawhead weaves together the two independent legends of the lost kingdom of Atlantis and that of King Arthur with sparkling originality and breath-taking colour.  Although the premise of these two legends being concurrent is historically impossible, one has to grant Lawhead this freedom because he clearly intends his book to be read as fantasy, not as historical fiction.  &quot;Taliesin&quot; is the first book in the series, and consists of two separate story-lines, one introducing us to Charis, princess of Atlantis and one of its few survivors, the other introducing us to Taliesin, prince of one of the British tribes.  Towards the end of the book, the twin plots merge with the romance and marriage of Charis and Taliesin, leading to the birth of the remarkable Merlin, thus setting the stage for the rest of the series about the legendary King Arthur.<br />Lawhead's fantasy is not altogether without flaws.  I did not feel I truly knew the characters and scenery in the same intimate way as in Tolkien and other fantasy greats.  The plot is not always consistently paced, and occasionally seems to degenerate into an aimless history without a real sense of an obvious conflict that needs to be resolved.  But Lawhead's fantasy world is still dazzling, and the further I got into his world, the more I found myself drawn in by a convincing, compelling, and enthralling story-line.  On the one hand Lawhead has created something heroic and noble, but the heroism is accompanied with an equal measure of tragedy, thus evoking emotions in the reader that range from ecstasy to genuine grief.<br />One of the highlights of this fantasy work is that Lawhead writes as a Christian, seeking to present a consistent Christian world-view in the course of his writing.  The sorrow one inevitably feels at the destruction and decay in the lives of individuals and societies eventually proves itself to be a sorrow over the destructive effect of sin.  Over against the empty paganism and rituals of polytheism, Lawhead presents the worship of the true God, the Creator.<br />Lawhead's theology is not altogether free of criticism.  I am not inclined to give pagan religions and prophets as much power and credibility as Lawhead does, since I think Romans 1 teaches us not to regard them as imperfect  &quot;shadows&quot; of the pure religion (p.371), but perversions which are little else than the worship of powerless wood and stone (Isaiah 44:6-20).  Although Lawhead clearly acknowledges God as the True God, it seemed to me that his focus on God as Creator comes at the expense of a recognition of God as Redeemer.  Certainly there is ample reference to Jesus Christ, but Lawhead seems to have overlooked a wonderful opportunity to present the gospel of Jesus Christ's work as a payment for sin.  Perhaps this is not surprising given that he portrays the Christian religion in the form of Roman Catholicism, mirroring its emphasis on outward rituals that dispense grace (p.403).  However, I must concede that Lawhead could simply be reflecting history in this respect.<br />But although I do not share all of Lawhead's religious convictions, this did not prevent me from finding this book both profound and stimulating.  In fact, the wonderful imagery and the complexity of Biblical allusions frequently astounded me.  The Biblical imagery is exceedingly subtle and skilfully woven into the story-line, soaking the novel and giving it richness and depth rarely found in fantasy.  The astute student of Scripture will notice veiled references to the Great Flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, God's questions to Job, Satan, John the Baptist, the Person of Jesus Christ as described in Revelation, the work of Jesus Christ as prophet, priest and king, the heavenly temple and kingdom, and more.  Lawhead's positive portrayal of sexual purity, his beautiful picture of marital love and faithfulness, and his delightful portrait of the unique roles of husband and wife are solidly Biblical and particularly touching.<br />If you are a fan of profound Christian fiction or else simply enjoy reading original and thoughtful fantasy, you will find this book a real treat.  If you enjoy both categories, this is a must have.rtrait of the unique roles of husband and wife are solidly Biblical and particularly touching.<br />If you are a fan of profound Christian fiction or else simply enjoy reading original and thoughtful fantasy, you will find this book a real treat.

The subtitle of this book says it all: &quot;The Imaginative Use of Books in Family Life&quot;.  Gladys Hunt will promote the imaginative use of books in your family in two ways, corresponding to the two halves of this book.  In the first half of this book, Hunt shares her insights and ideas about the value of reading, the usefulness of different genres, her notions about what makes a good book,  and useful guidelines on how to select good books.  Unfortunately, Hunt does not always express her thoughts and ideas in a completely coherent manner, but it would be a serious mistake to avoid this book for that reason.  What she does have to say is earnest, sincere, passionate, and incredibly valuable.  In the course of her sometimes unstructured ramblings, Hunt passes on many valuable insights about reading, such as the value of fantasy and poetry, and the positive contribution books can make in a child's life in contrast to the negative influence of the media.  What I really treasured, however, were the multitude of practical hints about making books come alive in the home.  Hunt offers terrific suggestions about reading stories out loud together as a family, and even shares worthwhile ideas to make family Bible reading more profitable.  The first half of this book alone makes this book worth purchasing, because if you apply some of these ideas they are sure to make books come alive in your home.<br />But what really makes this book a treasure is the second half, which is an extensive annotated bibliography of books worth reading, arranged by their suitability for various ages.  One might be tempted to quibble about a few favorite titles which have not been included, but you can't overlook the fact that this is a very comprehensive list that includes most children's classics and many more.  Parents who truly enjoy literature often are faced with the challenge of finding good literature.  Hunt makes this challenge a piece of cake, because here is a ready-to-use list of titles worth reading, an almost never-ending supply of books to keep your family busy nearly life-long.  She has done the hard work for us - mined through the endless number of books on library shelves, and passed on to us what is truly the honey that is worth reading.  As a Christian, Hunt is also very discerning and has a taste for what is truly good.  Yet her Christian filtering is not so narrow minded that it excludes all secular classics or great works of literature.  She has an appreciation for all literature that is quality literature, and so anyone who enjoys good literature will find her annotated bibliography most valuable.<br />In short, if you enjoy reading good books and want your children to do the same, then you cannot do without this book! The fact that this book is now in its third edition proves that many before me have found this book most useful.  If you do not yet have a passion for good children's books, reading this book is sure to change that.

Katy Steele Mystery No. 1: Tracks of Deceit &amp;  Katy Steele Mystery No. 2: Imperial Intrigue<br />&quot;Tracks of Deceit&quot; is the first mystery story in a series about the 19th century American detective Katy Steele.  After her father is murdered, Katy's determination to find her father's killer brings her to the construction site of the transcontinental railroad.  With her partner Sam Bronte, Katy uncovers a ruthless plot to sabotage the railroad project, and finds herself faced with murderous and money hungry villains who will stop at nothing to achieve their aims, even if it means Katy and her companions need to be &quot;eliminated.&quot;<br />&quot;Imperial Intrigue&quot; is the second volume in the series, and describes Katy and Sam's new assignment in protecting an Austrian prince and princess who are settling down on a ranch in the American West.  Katy soon shares in the struggles faced by the foreign royal party: adjusting to ranch life, befriending the ranch family, facing the murderous attempts of a greedy neighbouring rancher to take over the property, and avoiding death at the hands of a skilled assassin.<br />What NOT to expect:<br />1. Solid theology and a thought provoking message.....  Typical of much evangelical thinking, this book offers only shallow theology.  Typical are the ideas that heaven will be &quot;enriched&quot; by a wonderful Christian (&quot;Tracks of Deceit&quot; p.45), a false contrast between an Old Testament God of justice and the New Testament God of love (p.129), the idea that it is entirely wrong to judge someone even from their lifestyle (p.195), the pop-psychology assessment that an evil self-centred life is not really sin but rather indicative of being &quot;seriously sick...insane.&quot; (p.216), the secular notion that Christians must learn to love themselves more (&quot;Imperial Intrigue&quot; p.178), and that it is possible for an unbeliever to be &quot;basically a good person.&quot;  Despite the fall into sin, the authors have rather too much faith in human nature, which is probably not surprising considering their Arminian theology (p.50,142).  Such shallow thinking was evident throughout, and results in a grinding down of the gospel of Christ into a super-sweet sugar coating and sprinkling it over the story-line.  Also of concern is the Biblical thinking that is missing from these books.  Instead of focussing on the &quot;unseen&quot; heavenly promises, the authors focus with nauseating regularity on the &quot;seen&quot; qualities of physical beauty and physical attraction (&quot;Tracks of Deceit&quot; p.76,164, &quot;Imperial Intrigue&quot; p.32,47).  When this secular focus was combined with a liberal dose of sappy romance (&quot;Tracks of Deceit&quot; p.125, &quot;Imperial Intrigue&quot; p.81) where characters habitually wind up kissing at their first meeting or soon afterwards, at times I could hardly believe I was reading a Christian book.<br />2. Strong characterization.....  Katy herself is rather one-dimensional.  While barely shedding a tear over her father's death, she immediately goes off to play detective and find his murderer.  Although the characterization does improve in &quot;Imperial Intrigue&quot; (especially the attention devoted to the internal relationships of the ranch family), on the whole the characterization leaves much to be desired.  Even the unbelieving &quot;good guys&quot; are surprisingly unselfish or else become Christian at the tip of a hat, whereas the &quot;bad guys&quot; have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and are nearly always presented as &quot;human monsters&quot; that are always evil all the time.<br />3. A surprising and unpredictable plot..... The authors left so many clues that one of the surprising plot twists at the end of &quot;Tracks of Deceit&quot; came as no surprise whatsoever, but was instead entirely expected.  When there are surprises, in both books they are frequently the result of most remarkable coincidences thatare hardly credible, and thus hardly satisfying.  Although &quot;Imperial Intrigue&quot; was certainly more credible and convincing than &quot;Tracks of Deceit&quot;, weaknesses are still evident - among them an incident where the authors resort to having one of the characters have an unexplained urge to visit a grave in the middle of the night (p.195) in order to get three of the characters out of the house.  Oh please!<br />What to expect:<br />1. Lots of action, intrigue and murder.....  There is constant riveting action and intrigue, as Katy tumbles from one hair-raising situation to another.  There is action aplenty, and by the end of the &quot;Tracks of Deceit&quot; there are several corpses, gun battles, kidnappings and sabotage.  &quot;Imperial Intrigue&quot; also features constant action and intrigue, and probably even surpasses the effort of the first book.  Despite the lack of realism at times, it is really the story-line that gives these books any measure of success.<br />2. An informative historical picture.....  Despite the presence of a few questionable anachronisms (such as Katy's strong anti-discrimination and pro-feminist sentiments, as well as the frequent portrayal of minority groups as Christian), both books give interesting historical information without being tedious.  &quot;Tracks of Deceit&quot; passes on many interesting and accurate historical details about the construction of the transcontinental railroad project - without allowing the novel to degenerate into a history lecture.  Especially the conflict between two rival railway construction companies and the conflict between the Irish and the Chinese laborers is finely portrayed.  Similarly, &quot;Imperial Intrigue&quot; gives a fascinating portrait of the prairie setting, and the trials and triumphs of ranch life.<br />In short, if you are willing to overlook the over-sweetened sugar-coating of shallow soap opera theology, you can enjoy these books as mediocre mysteries.  But at best, these books offer little more than a so-so story-line, shoddily dressed in a rather poor-quality garment of thin Christian content.are hardly credible, and thus hardly satisfying.

But at best, these books offer little more than a so-so story-line, shoddily dressed in a rather poor-quality garment of thin Christian content.	2000-11-11
US	51067904	R2EGMM2TH0II4Y	0395974682	669379389	The Lord of the Rings	Books	5	6	9	N	N	A memorable &amp; monumental marathon journey.	&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy is not for everyone.  If you're used to a junk food diet of contemporary easy-to-read thrillers, you'll find &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; tough going.  This is no bag of high-cholesterol potato chips to be consumed in five minutes - this is a sack of solid food to be enjoyed over several evenings!  Unlike the brief attractions offered by a 100-meter sprint, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; offers the scenic adventures of a 100-mile walk.  Don't misunderstand this to mean that this journey is boring.  Most 100-meter sprint type novels provide only momentary and fleeting pleasure, whereas the marathon journey of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; provides an enduring and challenging journey, with a multitude of memorable pleasures.<br />Whose journey is it?  At the face of it, it is a journey undertaken by the hobbit Frodo and his companions.  Frodo possesses a most powerful ring, and the only way to prevent this ring from ever falling into the hands of the powers of evil is to destroy it - in the very heart of the kingdom of evil.  &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; describes the epic journey of the ring-bearer Frodo and his companions as they journey into the heart of enemy territory to do battle with the powers of evil.  If they successfully accomplish their quest, they will assure the  conquest of evil by good.<br />But it is not just Frodo who makes this marathon journey.  Tolkien has an uncanny ability to ensnare the reader, so that you will find yourself not just a spectator, but a participant in the marathon mission undertaken by Frodo and friends.  As you travel the journey with the ring-bearer Frodo and his company, they will become more than mere travelling companions.  They will become your friends.  You will feel you know them, and you will grow to love them - their joys will excite you, their sorrows will hurt you, their conquests will delight you, their failures will grief you.  And it will pain you to say goodbye to them all at the end.<br />Like the journey itself, however, participating in the journey by reading the trilogy can be tough going.  At times the travelling through the words is slow and tough going.  But at other times the pages fly by fast and furious with high paced action.  And precisely this makes the epic journey through the treasured pages of Tolkien so rewarding.  As a reader, you find yourself sharing in a very fantastic and yet very real journey, one which encompasses all of real life's emotions and experiences: sorrow as well as joy, inactivity as well as action, pain as well as pleasure.  While reading, you partake in the emotions and experiences of fantasy characters - hobbits, dwarves, elves, and the like - because these emotions and experiences are distinctly recognizable - morally these characters are so much like ourselves, and we recognize aspects of ourselves in them.<br />What's more, in the course of this long journey, you will be presented with breath-taking scenery.  Tolkien has a remarkable ability to describe scenery with colour, character and clarity, so that you will visualize every tree, rock and road.  By the time you are done, the setting of Middle-Earth will be as real as any place you've visited.  As such, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is not just about a story and a journey, it is about a place.  This place, you will discover, is immense and grand, because Tolkien has created cultures, histories, and languages.  The vast scope of the journey and place in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; makes it a truly epic novel.<br />In fact, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has all the qualities of an epic - an immense scope, combined with a heroic and grand style.  Tolkien constantly displays a mastery of the English language - the word usage at times gloriously grand, at times passionately poetic, at times wonderfully descriptive, but always amazing.  Together, the vast scope and elevated style combine to create a truly epic masterpiece, so that the three volumes of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; read like three acts of tremendously immense play, with a global cast of characters, and a worldwide stage.  And as you read, you are never quite sure whether this play is going to be a tragedy or triumph, as the powers of good seek to overcome the powers of evil.<br />This struggle between good and evil that actually makes &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a deeply religious book.  Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and although he adamantly maintained that it was written for pure entertainment and had no deeper meaning,  he could not avoid being influenced by his religious background, as is evidenced by his sharp view on morality, where good and evil are viewed as moral absolutes.  The epic struggle between good and evil occurs on a wider scale than in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and this gives the &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a much more serious tone, arising out of deeply rooted religious convictions.  Yet the struggle of good against evil never becomes a simplistic or shallow.  As in real life, Tolkien's characters have weaknesses and flaws, and are affected by their experiences - some on the side of good even being corrupted by evil.  And this makes the epic struggle for truth, freedom, justice and goodness all the more stimulating as your return to real life.  One cannot be unaffected by the commitment and undying devotion towards the cause of good, the undying devotion, even when it requires unselfish sacrifices to be made in the process.  In this sense, those who share Tolkien's underlying Christian values will especially enjoy the epic journey he has created.<br />But there are more ways in which Tolkien's religious insights implicitly shine through.  Biblical imagery is discernable throughout, especially the king's final victory and eternal reign of peace and joy, and banishment of evil is reminiscent of the victory of Christ over the dragon in Revelation.  For readers of Scripture, the images of light and happiness, the tree of life, and an eternal kingdom, will be strikingly familiar and recognizable.<br />But you do not have to be a Christian to enjoy &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;  There is nothing overtly religious about this trilogy, since the universe Tolkien creates and describes is a universe without God, where chance and fate are acknowledged as crucial players of the game, and where the conquest of evil is accomplished by the power of one's own will.  This is probably exactly what we should expect from a Catholic writer.<br />If you have never read &quot;The Lord of Rings&quot;, you should read it if only for the fact that it is widely acclaimed as the greatest fantasy classic, equaled by none.  Few have read it and failed to be affected by.  If you have not yet read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a most distinct pleasure and experience awaits you.  If you have already read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, you likely have already been touched by it, and yet the captivation of the reading experience is far from over.  That's the beauty of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; - the epic scale of this book is so grand, that it begs to be read again and again.  When you've read it once, you have the feeling that you have only just scratched the surface of something truly great.  Like an amusement park with too many attractions to see in one day, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; leaves you in constant wonder, and when you are done, you pledge to return again soon.

US	51067904	R1K7PM9M815RK1	0786223820	731558335	Avenger	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Vengance is mine says the Lord.  Or is it?	If you have not read the first two books in the &quot;Ben Sylvester Mystery Series&quot; (I haven't), then you'll find that this third book of the series takes off a little too fast, and is rather confusing at first.  Reference is made to characters and events of the first two books, and this left me as a newcomer to the series rather baffled at times.  This is, however, probably not a weakness of the book - it just means that it was not intended to be read independently, but only in the context of the rest of the series.<br />Even so, the cross currents of CIA, FBI, CSIS, Libertec, Juanita's government, Juanita's rebels (confused? - me too!), and numerous double crossers on various sides is difficult to keep track of at the best of times!  The terse style keeps the action moving quickly, and I found that only by reading very slowly I could follow the intrigue.  As such, this is not an easy book to read.  Even though it primarily has entertainment value, you need to work hard to keep up with all the various characters, plots and sub-plots.<br />That's not to say this is not a good book.  It is, particularly when the above is taken into consideration.  Lovers of adventure and mystery are sure to enjoy the constant action which rarely lets up.  The main character, Ben Sylvester, finds himself rolling from one danger to the next, chapter to chapter, and in this way the author continues to sustain interest throughout.  There is constant intrigue and suspense, as Ben meets with attempts on his life, kidnapping, government rebels, and more.  At times Ben seems to be just as confused as the reader as to who the good and the bad guys are, and in this sense the reader shares in his frustration.<br />What I especially enjoyed about this book is that it didn't just have a thin veneer of token Christian content.  Unlike the shallowness that characterizes much contemporary Christian fiction, &quot;Avenger&quot; boasts sharp characterization, and thoughtful dialogue.  Although the action surrounding Ben Sylvester is fast and furious, it is not so fast that we don't get the chance to understand his thoughts and feelings.  On the contrary, these feelings are portrayed vividly, and I found myself partaking in his struggles.  Ultimately, the real struggle in this novel is not a physical one, but a spiritual one: Can Ben be the &quot;avenger&quot; and execute justice on his enemy, or will he let God be the &quot;Avenger&quot; by leaving vengance to God?  It is this underlying struggle with bitterness, anger, hate and revenge that makes this mystery a solidly Christian book.  What the reader gains is more than a fast ride with thrills and spills, but a renewed understanding of a Biblical attitude toward revenge.  By the time I had turned the last page, my initial frustration had vanished, and I was eager to get hold of the first two titles of the series.e action surrounding Ben Sylvester is fast and furious, it is not so fast that we don't get the chance to understand his thoughts and feelings.

US	51067904	RRZT3IXVRNDT8	0679729917	68281403	The Best of Roald Dahl	Books	4	54	57	N	N	Short story master: Shocking, surprising, and satisfying	Roald Dahl is probably most famous as a popular children's writer, and is much loved by young readers world-wide for his contribution to children's literature with &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and many other favorites.  &quot;The Best of Roald Dahl&quot; proves that Dahl is also brilliant at writing short stories on a more adult level.  He has a wicked imagination, and has the uncanny ability to stretch it beyond the borders of the normal, picturing ordinary details in a most vivid and elaborate manner.  His brilliant imagination travels far and wide to places and events you have never imagined possible, and yet which are not fantastic but entirely believable because of his compelling realism.  His realism is sometimes so compelling, that you are almost persuaded that Dahl is telling a true story, and are left wondering whether or not the story is fact or fiction - a remarkable accomplishment for a fiction writer!<br />Dahl's interest is sometimes dark and off-colour, and his constant fascination with the morbid and ugly makes this book suitable only for mature readers.  I personally found his frequent use of blasphemy rather disturbing, as well has his occasional interest in sexual exploits (evident in three stories where he deals with matters such as prostitution, wife-swapping, and sexual conquest).  Despite this, the majority of these stories are unquestionably spell-binding.  Dahl's short stories have the capacity to leave you breathless because they are entirely unpredictable.  He has a love for unhappy, even horrible endings that shock and surprise, yet are incredibly satisfying because they are unexpected.  His incredible ability to describe an evil or horrible scheme in rich detail is so riveting, that you are completely caught up in its authenticity and excitement.  Just when you are at the point of rejoicing in its apparent success, Dahl takes the greatest pleasure in dashing all expectations to pieces, as the scheme ends in an astonishing failure.  You are left with a wonderful blend of mixed feelings: disappointment at failure, yet satisfaction knowing that justice is done, albeit in a cruel or most surprising manner.  His dark humor is completely captivating, and in certain respects Dahl can correctly be regarded as a literary genius.<br />Some of the highlights in my view are &quot;Taste&quot; (a delightful tale where a man lays his daughter on the line in a &quot;sure&quot; bet with a wine-taster),  &quot;Parson's Pleasure&quot; (where an underhanded scheme to acquire the some of the world's greatest antiques for peanuts is chopped to pieces on the verge of its success), &quot;Champion of the World&quot; (a poacher's dream nearly comes true with an incredible scheme to steal birds), and &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot;(a remarkable but believable story about a man who develops an incredible ability to see through playing-cards).<br />But these favorites are just the tip of the ice-berg.  This book boasts more than 500 pages, and contains nearly 30 of Roald Dahl's best short stories, selected from five of his published short story collections.  Each makes a delightful 10-20 minutes read, and exhibits his superb skill as one of the most entertaining and ingenius story-tellers in the late 20th century. Recommended!ng failure.

Because of Tolkien's reputation as a master story-teller, I began reading this book with absurdly high expectations.  The slow beginning confirmed my suspicions that such high expectations could not possibly be realistic, and I prepared myself to be gloriously disappointed.  Quite honestly, by the end of the first chapter I shared the opinion of the protagonist, the hobbit: I was rather unenthusiastic, and doubtful that the &quot;adventure&quot; which lay ahead could truly be as exciting as it promised to be.<br />But Tolkien rarely disappoints.  Within pages, along with our hobbit hero, Bilbo Baggins, I found myself launched into the famous fantasy world that is the product of Tolkien's imagination, a world of never-ending adventure, mystery and magic.  As I joined the hobbit on his remarkable quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reconquer the dwarves long-lost treasure, I met a wonderful array of friends and foes - wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and a myriad of other fantastic creatures - and my imagination and interest never waned.<br />By the end of the hobbit's adventure, like Bilbo, I was thoroughly satisfied.  At the conclusion, the wizard Gandalf remarks to the hobbit: &quot;My dear Bilbo!  Something is the matter with you!  You are not the hobbit that you were.&quot;  Yet it was not only the hobbit that had changed as a result of this adventure.  As a reader, I had to confess that I too had changed.  My initial lack of enthusiasm had entirely vanished.  I had participated in the hobbit's adventures, and like him, returned the better for it.  Tolkien's imaginative world is a world so vivid, that you cannot fail to return to the real world a changed person.  His descriptive abilities cannot fail to imprint his imaginary world in your memory.  This story is not deep, but it is delightful and unforgettable.  And like the hobbit, you will return to life the better having read it.<br />What's more, you can go &quot;there and back again&quot; again, and again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off.  For all ages, this book is eminently readable and re-readable, and belongs on every bookshelf.  Don't miss it, because you will miss one of the most enchanting escapes that literature has to offer.again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off.

US	51067904	R3JSA5HSYMHE2V	1564763390	726148736	September Strike	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Satisfying, but not stupendous.	This novel is a good first effort from this writer.  The plot is typical of many suspense thrillers, as a group of Palestinian extremists unleash a strike aimed at bringing America to its knees.  All the ingredients of a suspense thriller are there, including hostages, kidnapping, chemical warfare, murder, and a SWAT team take-out, complete with full media coverage.  The way in which Tanneberg works out the plot is intriguing and entertaining.  Tanneberg's strength, however, lies in his ability to write very descriptively, painting scenes in such vivid colours that I found myself virtually hearing, touching, smelling, and seeing the action unfold. The hero - Rev. John Cain - is not larger than life, but is portrayed with weaknesses as well as strengths.<br />Yet Tanneberg's writing style is much like his hero - there are weaknesses as well as strengths.  Unfortunately his superb attention to detail often comes at the expense of plot development, because it slows the novel down considerably.  If the average thriller novel can be compared to a fighter plane taking off at high speed from an aircraft carrier, this novel can be compared with a bomber, slowly lumbering down a lengthy runway.  Although the book consists of nearly 600 pages, in fact it contains only about 400 pages worth of story-line.  I felt that I was wading through unnecessary details to keep up with the story-line, rather than being carried along by it.<br />I also found the Christian content somewhat thin - certainly the novel centred around a church and characters who were Christians - but don't expect to find this novel life-changing or terribly thought-provoking.  But if you enjoy thrillers and are looking for a good read that will keep you busy for a decent stretch of time without being too &quot;deep&quot;, this book makes a good choice.	2000-09-25
US	51067904	R2EH5SOWRQH6UV	1556616694	856365863	The Messenger	Books	2	7	7	N	N	Cute, but not convincing.	The plot of this novella revolves around the premise of an angel, Ariel, who is sent to earth on a mission of mercy.  Ariel's heavenly pass-card is stolen, and she is unable to return to heaven.<br />The naivete of this heavenly messenger about the ways of earth is at first entertaining, but soon wears thin because it reflects badly on angels, and ultimately on their sender, God Himself.  Although the notion of earthly strangers being angels is certainly Scriptural (Heb. 13:2), the whole notion of an angel being stranded on earth is entirely unsupported by Scripture.  Further, Scripture's angels can be entertained &quot;unawares&quot; (Heb. 13:2) - but with Bunn's angels it's quite the opposite: their earthly ignorance does little to hide their heavenly identity!<br />Even when I tried to overlook these weaknesses, and suspend reality by entering the fictional world of Bunn's imagination, I did not find the story-line very compelling.  The plot is at best cute, although I felt that there was an unwarranted focus on the work of the Spirit outside the Word.  Ultimately, however, this book never quite overcomes the weakness of its premise: it's one thing for a story-line to be fiction, but it's quite another when one of the underlying theological concepts is fictional also.	2000-09-25
US	51067904	R2MXQ7SBJV62ZT	0849911796	723070327	The Visitation	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Matthew 24 comes to life.	Many Christians are familiar with Christ's prophecy in Matthew  24:4-5,11,24 that false prophets will come in the last days, proclaiming  that they are the Christ, performing miracles, and deceiving many.  Few  Christians have stopped to reflect on how Christ's prophecy about these  last days could become a reality in our own world.  Peretti does the job  for us, by painting a vivid fictional picture of how this could conceivably  come about.  His false Christ is initially so convincing, that I found  myself reading with a strong sense of disbelief, thinking &quot;This  Messiah looks like the real thing, acts like the real thing, but something  is not quite right!&quot;  It is this sense of disbelief that kept me  reading, intensely curious as to how Peretti would unravel the plot!<br />The plot is intriguing and entertaining.  Peretti sustains interest by  working with a story-line composed of twin strands that are intertwined  throughout the novel: one being the protagonist's past, the other being his  present.  Although the plot is not always convincing (the conclusion falls  somewhat flat since several loose ends are left hanging), on the whole it  is engaging and suspenseful.<br />Yet at the same time Peretti is very  introspective.  He takes the reader on a fast ride, but not so fast that  you don't get to enjoy the scenery on the way.  The main character, Travis  Jordan, is very believable, and his struggles and development are superbly  portrayed.  In the process, Peretti shares thoughtful insights about the  state of church-life in contemporary North America.  His careful attention  to characterization enables him to create an effective satire on the  hypocrisy of emotion-driven charismatics, as well as the superficiality of  factory-style big city churches.  At one point he goes somewhat too far, in  my view, by creating a false dilemma between membership in Christ's church  and having a personal relationship with Christ.  His endorsement of  Arminian theology is also one I personally do not share.<br />But you don't  have to agree with Peretti in every respect to find this novel stimulating.  While being entertained by an original story-line, I found myself gaining  a heightened awareness of the dangers of false prophets in the future, and  of the dangers of superficial church life in the present.  It is this  quality that makes this novel much more than a story with a token Christian  touch, but a novel with a genuinely Christian and thought-provoking  message.logy is also one I personally do not share.<br />But you don't  have to agree with Peretti in every respect to find this novel stimulating.

The captivating tale of the Christian Jewess Hadassah took me on  a breath-taking ride that starts in the ruins of Jerusalem, travels to the  godless hub of first century Rome, and concludes in the Artemis worshipping  city of Ephesus.<br />This book has the capacity not only to keep you  captivated for as long as it takes to read (500 pages plus!), but long  afterwards also.  Rivers' story-telling capabilities are simply superb, as  is her colourful characterization, and these are unquestionably some of the  highlights of this novel. Particularly compelling is the touching manner in  which Rivers portrays the special relationship between the slave Hadassah  and her master Julia, and I gained valuable insights and understanding  about slavery from this relationship.  Rivers' theological weaknesses  (endorsement of Arminianism and belief in ongoing revelation outside of  Scripture) are evident, but only occur incidentally, and do not really  detract from the power of the novel.<br />Her portrayal of first century Rome  is especially outstanding.  The culture of the Roman empire is described in  vivid detail, complete with its godless and decadent lifestyle, political  intrigue and corruption, infatuation with gladiators and games, sex and  sensuality.  The description of Rome's decadence is at times almost too  vivid, and consequently the book is not really suitable for younger  readers.  The inclusion of contemporary issues such as abortion,  homosexuality, and common-law marriage at first seem anachronistic, but I  soon realized that the decay evident in contemporary Western culture is  merely a mirror image of the decay that also characterized and eventually  destroyed corrupt Rome.<br />Over against the destructive decay of Roman  culture, Rivers describes its counter-culture: Christianity.  The only hope  for a people trapped in a immoral and disintegrating world - both then and  now - is the Saviour and restorer of life: Jesus Christ.  Ultimately this  age-old contrast between the church and the world is at the heart of this  epic novel.  As never before, I was able to picture and appreciate the  extent to which the Christians of the early church were counter-culture in  first century pagan Rome.  This renewed understanding of Christianity being  counter-culture quickly became a personal incentive to be a faithful  Christian in our equally corrupt times.  It is especially this quality that  made &quot;A Voice in the Wind&quot; not only immensely satisfying, but  also incredibly stimulating for my own faith.<br />This novel is not just  good, it's great, and is undoubtedly one of the very best in contemporary  Christian fiction.  Very highly recommended!or a people trapped in a immoral and disintegrating world - both then and  now - is the Saviour and restorer of life: Jesus Christ.

This was the first Francine Rivers title I have read, and came highly  recommended, so my expectations were high.  One of the outstanding  qualities immediately evident in this novel is Rivers' superb ability to  describe real feelings.  Few people have the ability to understand the  feelings and struggles of others.  Even less are able to communicate these  feelings and struggles to others.  Rivers succeeds admirably on both  counts.  The main character Dynah, like people in real life, is  unpredictable, and Rivers' description of her struggle with the difficult  issues and consequences of rape, pregnancy and abortion mirrors the highs  and lows experienced by people in the real world.  Although Rivers is  clearly committed to an absolute pro-life position on abortion, she shows  that applying this consistently in real life situations involves a  difficult and painful struggle. Her characters are far from shallow, and  their development throughout the course of the plot enables Rivers to work  with deeper themes of repentance and forgiveness.<br />A literary criticism  could be made that the fairy-tale type ending where Dynah and Joe pledge to  be married is too optimistic and is a concession to the standard movie  romance.  It seems to be a significant departure from the realism that  Rivers has so brilliantly described throughout the rest of the novel, since  the real struggles that Dynah experienced are far from over with the birth  of her child and impending marriage.  However, on the whole this novel's  strength lies its literary qualities.<br />Notwithstanding the above kudos,  The Atonement Child is not entirely exempt from criticism.  It is  unfortunate that Rivers' commitment to the sixth commandment (by firmly  maintaining a pro-life position over against murderous abortion) is not  accompanied with an equal commitment to the third commandment (the constant  casual use of God's Name as an expletive borders on the blasphemous) and  the fourth commandment (there are a number of instances where the main  characters buy a meal on a Sunday, implicitly endorsing Sunday shopping).  Moreover, I found Rivers' portrayal of the antagonistic church community  somewhat too negative. Although it is undeniable that the church community  does not always function as it should, I sensed that the important role and  involvement of a sympathetic and supportive church community could have  been developed more strongly.<br />Of more serious concern is Rivers' belief  in ongoing revelation.  On at least two occasions, God is presented as  speaking directly to and through Dynah.  Readers like myself who believe  that God's revelation is sufficient and complete in the Bible, will have to  sadly conclude that Rivers is unscriptural on this point.<br />The above  weaknesses, however, do not detract from the novel's strengths.  I simply  present them for the consideration of discerning readers, but still do not  hesitate in speaking very highly of this book.  Despite its theological  weaknesses, this novel is rightly regarded as one of the best in  contemporary Christian fiction.there are a number of instances where the main  characters buy a meal on a Sunday, implicitly endorsing Sunday shopping).

I decided to read this novel because it is widely acclaimed as a  contemporary science fiction classic.  Douglas Adams' description of Arthur  Dent, who is the lone man to survive the destruction of the planet earth,  is consistently humorous and entertaining.  Dent is set loose to roam the  galaxy, accompanied with an alien friend who is thankfully equipped with  the indispensable Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.<br />As the novel  progresses, it becomes evident that despite the superficial whimsical tone,  Adams is dealing with deeper themes relating to the meaning and existence  of human life.  The absurdity created by his imagination is not just a  matter of light-hearted sci-fi entertainment, but is a cloak which Adams  uses to convey his philosophy of human life and his personal  worldview.<br />One needs to recall that this novel was born in the late  1970s, in the hey-day of technology and space travel, a time when there was  a great deal of optimism and faith in science as the saviour of mankind.  Adams mocks this human arrogance.  The arrogance of Bent's fellow-humans in  destroying his home, becomes a microcosm for the arrogance of humankind,  and when it is applied to man's own home earth, results in man's own  destruction.  Adams' scorn for scientific arrogance is especially manifest  when it appears that the rulers of earth are not scientists, but their own  laboratory mice, who were secretly conducting large-scale experiments on  their captors all along.<br />Yet this novel achieves much more than a  scoffing of scientific arrogance.  It becomes painfully evident that  something essential is missing from the universe described in the  Hitchhiker's Guide: God.  When questioned by man about his existence, God  &quot;promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.&quot;  God's absence from  Adams' fictional universe corresponds to God's absence in Adams' personal  worldview.  The worldview which Adams believes in and portrays is a galaxy  without a Creator.  Adams is in fact a self-confessed &quot;radical  atheist&quot;, and holds this position very seriously.<br />But if Adam's  universe is a world without God, this leads to an inevitable question: In  such a universe, what is the meaning and purpose of life?  Adams toys with  this question when he describes the &quot;The Ultimate Question of Life,  the Universe and Everything.&quot;  After seven and a half million years of  calculation, the super computer &quot;Deep Thought&quot; announces that the  answer is &quot;Forty-two.&quot;  This meaningless answer is  incomprehensible, and is apparently so because we don't understand the  question properly!  Here Adams whimsically propounds his purpose for planet  earth: earth is a gigantic experiment, because it is on earth that the  question about the meaning and purpose of life is voiced, but never  answered!  The purpose of earth is to raise the question about its  purpose.<br />In Adams' atheistic worldview, the question about the purpose of  life cannot be answered, because the existence of the very creator of the  universe is denied.  Such a question can only be asked, answered, and  understood in a Christian worldview where the existence of the Creator is  maintained, because apart from Him, creation is indeed purposeless.  In  this respect, the message of Adams' classic is the same as that of the  Bible book of Ecclesiastes: there is no purpose and meaning in a world that  rejects God.  However, it is eternally unfortunate that Adams does not have  the same conclusion as Ecclesiastes, where the premise of practical atheism  is reversed, God's existence once again affirmed, and purpose discovered by  serving and obeying God the Creator.  Present day adherents of practical  atheism who share Adams' empty worldview will discover that they will spend  their life in the same way as Adams - in life whimsically hitchhiking an  empty earth without God, and in death discovering that that God was always  there, but that by their rejection of Him in the past, they will spend  eternity without Him in the future.  But then it will be too late.  Because  unlike the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, eternity without God has no  room for frivolous laughter, but only for sorrow and regret.<br />In  portraying the emptiness of an atheistic worldview, Adams is outstanding.  In endorsing this worldview, Adams is to be most pitied.  May God spare us  from echoing his endorsement.ejection of Him in the past, they will spend  eternity without Him in the future.

Adams, who is world renowned for  his Reformed approach to the field of counselling.  Mack has largely  followed in the footsteps of his mentor.  He is the author of several  books, all of which reflect the influence of the Jay Adams approach to  counselling.  Mack is currently the Director of the Christian Counselling  and Educational Foundation in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.<br />Strengthening  Your Marriage was initially developed as part of the requirements of Mack's  doctoral program under Adams, and this practical volume is essentially the  fruit of these studies.  Not surprisingly, it reflects the sensible and  solidly Biblical approach of Adams throughout.<br />Taking his starting  point in the divine blueprint for marriage revealed in Genesis 2:24, Mack  focuses on developing a Biblical understanding of becoming &quot;one  flesh&quot; in all areas of marriage.  Each area receives a solidly  Biblical exposition, with the following topics being addressed: unity  through understanding God's purpose for marriage; unity through a clear  understanding of the wife's responsibilities and husband's  responsibilities; unity through good communication; unity through financial  agreement; sexual unity; unity through a common philosophy of raising  children; promoting and maintaining unity by means of family religion.  Each chapter is followed by a comprehensive set of questions which  reinforce the content of the chapter by requiring the readers to study  various Bible verses and apply these Biblical principles to their  relationship.<br />Mack's intention is to promote solidly Biblical  pre-marital and marital counselling.  The book is primarily intended to be  used by pastors and counsellors as a guide and workbook in such  counselling.  However, it also has the potential to be used as an effective  tool by couples on their own.<br />The main strength of Strengthening Your  Marriage is that it is thorough, Reformed, and Biblical.  Mack constantly  refers to Scripture, and yet has the gift of being very concrete and  practical at the same time.  Be warned however - the density of its content  means that this book is not an easy armchair read.  However, Mack never  intended this to be an armchair read in the first place - it requires  systematic study and work on the part of readers.  Such study and work,  however, is sure to reap rich rewards.<br />In short, pastors and elders alike  will find Strengthening Your Marriage to be an excellent tool for dealing  with the basic aspects of marriage.  Jay Adam's recommendation is one I  enthusiastically endorse: &quot;Dr. Mack has produced a volume to which you  will turn again and again.  Buy it; it belongs on your shelf!&quot;thening Your  Marriage is that it is thorough, Reformed, and Biblical.

This book is a goldmine of topics that take daily conversations beyond the trivial and mundane.  I have carried this book around with me many times,  and it has turned many a dull conversation about the weather into a  sparkling discussion about life: my attitude in my own life and in the  lives of others.<br />In a group of friends, this book works wonders.  Asking &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;personal&quot; questions to your  friends can be artificial and difficult, but with the help of this book  it's a piece of cake.  Have one member of the group pick a question number  at random, and then have them answer that question, followed by the other  members of the group.  It works fantastic!<br />My only gripe with this book  is that as a Christian, I found that some of the questions were trivial and  unimportant.  For example, questions about personal boundaries with respect  to sexuality or the preservation of human life were easy for me to answer  on the basis of the guidelines of the Bible.  My Christian friends also  found that these questions didn't result in much discussion, because we all  agreed with each other from the outset!  We also found that some questions  are too direct and inappropriate, such as very specific questions about  your first sexual encounter.<br />However, such questions can easily be  skipped over by the discerning reader, and there are more than enough other  questions in this book to keep a group busy in healthy conversation for a  long time.

There is no doubt that Bill Bryson can make me laugh.  Out loud even!  Bryson's whimsical description of his stop and go tour through Europe  constantly entertains.  I learnt about Europe, the idiosyncrasies of its  places and people.<br />Probably one of the highlights was Bryson's  hilarious description of his desperation to reach the toilet of his hotel  room while his terribly overfull bladder is bursting.  Without giving my  belly a chance to recover from laughing, this account was immediately  followed by the equally hilarious description of Bryson's efforts to find  food in the hotel to satisfy the urgent needs of his terribly empty  stomach, an attempt which involved dead end fire-escapes, three drunken  Japanese men in blue business suits, a stubborn elevator that keeps  returning to the same floor, locked doors, and an over-zealous waiter who  takes away the very peanuts that our starved hero so desperately needed.<br />What I find most disappointing about this book, however, is that Bryson  frequently sees the need to resort to a brand of humor below the waist and  above the knees.  Such gutter humour, sexual jokes and innuendos are hardly  necessary given Bryson's incredible talent with words.  Although there are  chapters without this foul-mouthed and low-down humour, on the whole Bryson  has painted the whole book with this gutter-style brush of sexual humour.  In my view this negative cancels out all the positives of the book.  If it  wasn't for this, &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; would be a brilliant  book.  As it is, however, Bryson has successfully allowed his book to be  re-classified amongst a great deal of &quot;trash&quot; in the humour  section.  Too bad.<br />On the bright side, this book is one of Bryson's early  works, and he seems to have matured with age.  The weaknesses of this book  are much less evident in his most recent work, &quot;In a Sunburned  Country&quot;, which describes his trip to Australia.

See a  jet powered boat with a water skier at the Red Sea is in my view a  disrespectful anachronism.

The intriguing element of mystery that  makes detective Cadfael's presence essential to the plot clinches this  novel as a romping success.<br />If you enjoy mystery, as well as a writer's  ability to make excellent use of the English language with colourful  descriptions, you are sure to enjoy this book.	2000-08-04

This book has been a source of endless delight for our young  children.<br />In the style of the &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; series, Christian  illustrator Daniel Hochstatter has pages of brightly coloured and  entertaining pictures.  Each page features various various characters or  items that the children must find on the page.  &quot;Sammy the sheep&quot;  and his &quot;shepherd&quot; as well as their companions are hidden  somewhere on each page.<br />This title follows the &quot;Adventures of  Sammy&quot; title.  Unfortunately, it does not quite meet the same standard  of the first title.<br />My main concern with this book, is that the  illustrations picture scenes from Bible narratives, eg Noah's ark, the  dividing of the Red Sea.  Hochstatter does this rather disrespectfully,  confusing the modern with the ancient.  See a jet powered boat with a water  skier at the Red Sea is in my view a disrespectful anachronism.<br />However,  it must be conceded that with young children who don't realize that this is  intending to picture a Bible story, this is not an issue.<br />Nonetheless,  the entertainment value of this book makes it most desireable.  Recommended!	2000-08-04

When compared with  works of other contemporary fiction writers, Grisham's novels stand out as  cleaner, and more original.  His plots never fail to surprise and  entertain.  Though Grisham's books have all been bestsellers, &#34;The  Testament&#34; is one of his finest achievements.<br /><br />Grisham is supposedly a Christian but it is not noticeable  in most of his books.  &#34;The Testament&#34; is an exception in its  vivid depiction of a contented missionary in contrast with the emptiness of  North American materialism.  As such, this novel not only entertains, it  also brings a hard hitting thought-provoking message, that should cause us  all to examine ourselves, and ask ourselves whether the emptiness in the  lives of the characters in this book is manifest in our own life.  Conversely, if we seek peace and contentedness in our own life, it is found  in the same place where Grisham's missionary protagonist finds it - in  Jesus Christ and the God of the Bible.<br /><br />It is this theological message  underlying &#34;The Testament&#34; that distinguishes this novel from  most of Grisham's others.  Not only is this book an entertaining  page-turner, it also will leave you thinking about the purpose and meaning  of life.  Other Grisham favorites for me include &#34;The Client&#34;,  &#34;The Pelican Brief&#34;, and &#34;The Rainmaker&#34;.	2000-08-04

What is especially oustanding about his style is that he writes many of  his books in documentary form, which leaves the reader almost convinced the  story really happened. It is this unique quality that makes Crichton's  fiction stand out from much other contemporary fiction.<br /><br />&#34;The Great Train Robbery&#34; is an excellent example of Crichton's writing. It is  not only entertaining and suspenseful, but the historical setting and fine  details will leave you wondering whether or not this really is a work of  fiction or non-fiction! When a writer is able to write such a credible story which leaves the reader almost convinced it is a historical account, there's no doubt that the writer has been very successful in his  literary craft.<br /><br />I've read most of Michael Crichton's books, and this remains one of my all-time favourites.  Other recommended Crichton titles include  &#34;Airframe&#34;, &#34;Jurassic Park&#34;, &#34;The Andromeda  Strain&#34;, and &#34;Timeline.&#34;	2000-08-04

Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.  This is unmerited, because the works of Tolkien  and Lewis go far beyond the level of story - they impart great truths about  human nature and theology on a deeper level.  Rowling's novels do not have  such a deeper level, but are simply books which entertain.<br />That is not to  say that Rowling's novels are not good.  They clearly are.  The incredible  sales record of the Harry Potter series tells its own story of success.   <br />As a fantasy story-teller about the world of magic, Rowling is  undeniably skilled.  Many of Rowling's concepts are strongly reminiscent of  the brilliant children's fantasy fiction by Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl, and  she likely has been influenced by their work.<br />However, Rowling clearly  has a style of her own, and in this fourth book of the Harry Potter series,  has confirmed her reputation as a story-teller for children.  This novel  has all the ingredients of a good children's novel - suspense, imagination,  and excitement.  <br />Most importantly, children can identify with its  characters.  Although Rowling describes a fantasy world that exists only in  her imagination and the reader's, it is clear that this fantasy world is  largely a mirror image of our own 20th century Western world.  What makes  this series so successful, is that people recognize themselves in the novel  - their school life (Hogwarts), their human rights ideology (Hermione's  fight for the elves), their worship of team sports (the quiddich world cup)  and individual sports (the tri-wizard contest), their political world  (ministry of magic), their media (interviews with the Daily Prophet), their  concern with health and beauty, their relationships between guys and girls,  and their love of feasting and food (The Yule Ball). <br />Although Harry  Potter and the Goblet of Fire is about a fantasy world, ultimately it is  about ourselves.  And that is why we love it.  Highly recommended!	2000-08-04

Readers who want  their concept of heaven to be determined by Scripture must be discerning  and be aware which aspects are Scriptural and which are speculation.  Despite this weakness, however, this novel spectacularly demonstrates the  eternal consequences of our response to the gospel, as well as the  emptiness of modern culture.<br />The insight into the secular bias of the  media that the reader gains from this book alone makes it worth reading.<br />Christian fiction at its best!	2000-08-04

Allegorically, it  resembles a modern science fiction version of Pilgrim's Progress.<br />However, its complexity does not detract from its readability.  It reads  easily as a powerful novel, and even readers relatively unfamiliar with  Scripture will find it an enjoyable read, and grasp the depth of its  powerful message.  Alcorn would do well to consider making a study guide as  a companion to this novel, however.<br />My first read of this book did leave  me with some doctrinal questions about Alcorn's theology, but on the whole  this is an eminently readable and powerful novel.  In contrast to most  contemporary Christian fiction which merely leaves the reader satisfied,  this novel is sure to leave you satisfied and with a renewed perspective on  your life.  Great stuff!	2000-08-04

Although  his interest is sometimes dark and off-colour, his stories are  unquestionably spellbounding.  <br />This is a collection of his best short  stories, each making a delightful 5-10 minutes read.  It exhibits Dahl's  superb skill as one of the best entertaining story-tellers in the late 20th  century.  Highly recommended!<br />His children's books are worth checking out  as well - &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is probably his  most famous work, but there are many others which children are guaranteed  to love.	2000-08-04
US	51067904	R2NMMKO1UO2RRR	0425163865	303545082	Detective	Books	1	7	12	N	N	OFFENSIVE AND VERY DISAPPOINTING	I found this book to be one of the most disappointing of Hailey's books yet.  In terms of plot and action, it was on par of many of his previous successes.  However, of great concern in this book is the implicit message  that it brings.  What is especially offensive in &quot;Detective&quot; is  the clear anti-Christian thrust of the whole book.  Whether one is a  Christian or not, one can not help but getting the feeling that Hailey is  attacking Christians, and making them as the bad guys of  society.<br />Firstly, the main hero is an ex-priest.  He has rejected the  Christian faith completely, and Hailey goes to great lengths to show how he  rejected Christianity, and regarded it as impossible to maintain.  It is  obvious that Hailey takes great pains, even stepping far out of the plot,  to do this.<br />Secondly, the main criminal is someone who justifies his  mass-murder on the basis of a warped view of the Bible's book of  Revelation.  Again, Hailey is in a subtle way discrediting those who  maintain that the Bible (including Revelation) is the Word of God.<br />From  the above, it is evident that Hailey is doing far more than just writing a  book which includes Christians and ex-Christians.  It appears evident that  in an underhanded way he is undermining Christianity and what it stands  for.  I do not expect Hailey to place Christianity above other religions  (although personally I would like to see him do that).  However, I DO  expect Hailey to be treat Christians fairly, and not treat them any more  negatively than others.  In fact, I am convinced that if the book had been  written presenting any other religion disfavorably in this manner, it would  have received a great deal of criticism among critics.  When it's  Christians who are misrepresented or rejected, it seems to be okay.  Anyone  can see that this is not even-handed or fair.<br />In short, this is a  disappointing book, which I found very offensive, and can not recommend to  others.	1998-12-02

Its strength is its written style and plot development.  However, the entire plot development is based on a dispensationalist eschatology which  is theologically flawed.  The book depends on a literal interpretation of  many Old Testament prophecies, whereas Scripture itself indicates that many  of these prophecies are to be understood spiritually.  &quot;Israel&quot;  designates the New Testament church (Gal 6:16; Heb 8:10), and the  &quot;Jerusalem&quot; of prophecy also is fulfilled in spiritual sense, as  is clear from Gal 4:24 and Heb 12:22.  When one understands that the book's  theology is fundamentally flawed, one can not but realize that the book has  a serious weakness.  Unfortunately, when the book is stripped of its flawed  theology, nothing remains, for it is this theology which forms the plot.  If you are not an adherent of dispensationalist eschatology, I would  strongly recommend not reading this book, as it will only confuse and  disappoint the reader.	1998-11-27
