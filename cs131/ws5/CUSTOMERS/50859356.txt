I have never read a book like this.  The author did an excellent job at the &quot;sentence level,&quot; and at the &quot;chapter level,&quot; but it was the arrangement of chapters which I at first did not like.  I read several books per week, and rarely review one, but this one just, well, jolted the heck out of me.  By the end of the book I realized the construction was not an accident, but very creative and, in a word, excellent.  It is hard to believe this book was self-published, and just goes to show why so many of the most creative come from &quot;out of the woods.&quot;  No mainstream editor (I imagine) would have let this book be published in its current form.  It's just too different.  He can be incredibly funny, but was constantly scaring the bee-jeebers out of me, or had me laughing and crying at the same time.  I hope the writer reads his reviews.  If you do, Mr. Yon, don't sell out for the bucks!	2001-08-13

There are better and worse, but this one is the best I have read so far and is really on the money.  It seems that most of the navigation books are written by people who spend more time learning to write  than to navigate.  Nothing wrong with that, since I know I don't write the best, but I do know how to navigate.  I haven't been lost more than two or three times in about the last five years, and when I was, I just followed the basic rules (find a creek and follow it downstream, or a powerline, etc.) and got out in a couple days.

That is the first evidence that the writer is telling the truth, his truth, and without sugarcoating.  On the other hand, there are small mountains of books whose purpose seems to be to inflame passions of the readers, which is powerful evidence that the writers are simply screaming for attention.  \\"Just a Sailor\\" rang with truth because there were times that the author sincerely... me off, but he never seemed to do it for the sake of such.  He was just telling things as he saw/sees them, which takes courage.  As with probably every book I have read - and that would be thousands - there were parts that I enjoyed more than others.  In \\"Just a Sailor\\" I enjoyed the Vietnam narration but, surprisingly, found the \\"civilian aspects\\" and the diving and photography just as interesting.<br />I tend to find it annoying in some military books (and in some books on business or on government), when the author gives a blow by blow of the internal politics.  Hearing all the tales and reasons why the \\"commander is incompetent\\" or why the \\"REMFs should all be dropped in the ocean\\" grows old.  There were a couple of times when I thought the author was going that route.  But, luckily, he sailed away at the last minute, which let me know that he had seen the political icebergs but wisely chose to avoid them, favoring instead to tell what was unique about his story.  I found the technical information regarding the bends and other diving information was very interesting, well presented, and held my attention the strongest.  This was an excellent book, and I look forward to the author's next.	2001-02-13

I saw that the 24 February 2000 review from the reader in Los Angeles was so accurate and well written  that I scrapped mine; no need to say many of the same things twice.  I will  say, however, that from a man's perspective I found Lori Gottlieb's  thoughts as a girl extremely enlightening.  At times her thoughts and  pressures during adolescence were so different than mine were as a boy,  that for me her book is an excellent look into what amounts to another  world.  The excerpts from the author's diary are analogous to fossilized  thoughts and feelings preserved in amber and, as such, offer very important  insights for fathers or for others who deal with children.  Thank you Lori  for giving us a poignant, resonating look into the pressures of being a  girl, and for delivering a good share of laughs along the way.	2000-07-21

First you walk out into a clear desert night, a cloudless sky above, and you see many stars.  There are the patterns of stars described by the zodiac signs, but those patterns are  haphazard, jerky, and \\"not real.\\"  Those are the patterns people strain to  create from apparent chaos because they do not have the tools to see deeper  into space.  They do not have the tools to see the Real patterns.  But  there are those people who do have the tools, and one such implement is the  telescope.  The better the telescope, and the more you learn where to look,  the better you see the patterns.  You see entire galaxies, binary stars,  and those exploding.  There are black holes.  Life and death throughout the  universe, and there are repeated themes everywhere you look.  Only the  details change.  You may not understand the archetypical galaxies, or how  they dance together in some great symphony that physicists are forever  struggling to describe, but the fact that there ARE patterns is obvious.   The rules apparently don't change, just the details in how they are  expressed.  This is nothing new, and it is certainly not a revelation that  patterns occur, too, within us.  Perhaps myths are like internal galaxies,  swirling about within us by certain rules, and then there is \\"that  uncertainty thing\\" that we hope might translate into free will.  Well, this  review seems a bit galactic itself, and perhaps a bit out there, but Joseph  Campbell, with this book, has provided a telescope that points to certain  galaxies within each person and population, galaxies which reverberate  throughout humankind past, present, and future.  And though Campbell helps  us see these galaxies, there obviously remains much to be explained.  One  of the interesting things about the act of peering through a telescope is  in knowing that other people have looked, or will look, through the same  apparatus.  Will they see what you see?  How will others interpret messages  delivered by photons that zip through space into their curious eyes?         Recently I read a book called &quot;Danger Close&quot; by Mike Yon.  It is  the true story of an American soldier who was charged with murder in  Maryland.  Throughout the book I noticed themes, patterns and so forth.  At  times it seemed as though the author were winking at a small (a very small)  section of the readership.  The author seemed to allude to Joseph Campbell  and his discoveries.  In the final hilarious chapter of Danger Close, the  future soldier, then a teenager in a Florida high school uttered, \\"sat chit  ananda\\" to his raging school principal.  And that was when I knew the  author had studied his art beyond the writing of a single true sentence; he  said so clearly to those few who could read the signs.  The author had  peered through the telescope created by Joseph Campbell, had seen the  galaxies swirling, and had applied the principles of Creative Mythology to  a true story, and perhaps that is why &quot;Danger Close&quot; is  categorized as \\"creative nonfiction.\\"  The book, or rather the author, even  won the very prestigious William A. Gurley award for application of  scholarship.        I have also noticed that a certain lawyer, a man who  wins his cases without fail, sub fuses mythology in his winning arguments.   The lawyer uses symbolism and the structure of myth tirelessly, presenting  contemporary cases as if they were epic drama.  Some of these stories, when  presented to juries, have returned verdicts worth tens of millions of  dollars.  THAT is an example of the power of \\"applied myth.\\"          &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; is a \\"must read,\\" a part of the  training, for any serious writer, artist, or anyone who wishes to reach  people on a basic level, or to better understand some of the powerful  galaxies swirling within us.	2000-03-17
