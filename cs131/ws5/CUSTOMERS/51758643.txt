Moreover, Trull's character in House of Chains (second weakest book of the series), while intriguing, certainly wasn't a 'star.' <br /> <br />Well, I can fully attest that my fears and predilections were wrong.  <br /> <br />Midnight Tides is awesome.  It stands right at the (if not above the) top of the line of the series.   <br /> <br />The 'backstory' of the Tiste Edur, Tiste Andii, and Letherii empire (remnants of the first empire) was filled with important details for the over-arching story that courses through the Tale of the Malazan Empire.   <br /> <br />Additionally, new characters, such as Tehol and Bugg, Iron Bars, and Withal are note-worthy.  The familial tragedy of Fear, Rhulad and Trull (and the whole Tiste Edur 'race', for that matter)-- being betrayed, if you will, by a certain pronounced nefarious prescence-- strikes true. <br /> <br />This book is a winner.  The series is a winner. <br /> <br />If you love literature.  If you love the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre, get this book.  Read this series.	2005-05-07

After the exhilirating joyride which was 'Time's Eye', I can't help but state how disenchanted, disappointed, and saddened I was by the  near-tripe that is Sunstorm. <br /> <br />I'll attempt to do so with minimal/no spoilers. <br /> <br />First, there's the obvious:  Bisesa is nearly non-existant.  While this itself is acceptable, her minimal presence is, at best, distracting; at worst: disappointing.  Where is the headstrong lady from the first book?  Where is the go-getter?  Heck, where is the presence of mind to weep for your lost love, grab your daughter, and do something.  Instead....   <br /> <br />Second, there's the more obvious:  the book, unlike it's predecessor, piles on the science at the cost of the fiction.  While this is fantastic in the sense of addressing a major (for sci-fi) shortcoming of the first book, it cost it's enjoyability.  Within the first few pages, we (the readers) are aware of the situation and 'the cause'.  We don't need 200+ more pages describing it, and the solution.   Along those lines, at the cost of the (occassionally nauseating while pleasantly liberating) PC vestiges of the book:  \\"increase the humanity\\".  Make me, the reader, *care* for Siobhan.  Or Bud.  Or Eugene.  Anybody. <br /> <br />Well, I take that back:  Athena was a *worthy* addition.  I empathized with her. I would have like to have more  time spent on her.  Of course, 'her' portion was itself limited.  To the degree that became, itself discouraging, but, at the least, in line with the rest of the novel. <br /> <br />Finally, the resolution was... anything but.  Minimal details on the First Born emerged, and the post-storm section was glossed over. <br /> <br />Hopefully, being the optimist, Clarke and Baxter will revisit the world a third time.  Hopefully, if so, it will be the charm.	2005-04-13
US	51758643	RCEB2N6KJ1WBM	0756402190	460694079	1: Shadowmarch: Shadowmarch: Volume I	Books	4	75	85	N	Y	Not his best, but good to have Tad back in the genre....	Shadowmarch, the second fantasy novel that Tad Williams has written since completing the SciFi \\"Otherland\\" series, is the first such entry in an entirely new series.  I believe the major, non-spoiler plot points are either addressed in the publisher's description or through other reviews.  With that in mind, I'll focus on this book when compared to the rest of his works. <br /> <br />In contrast to his pedigree (see the first two hundred pages of \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\" or the entire book that was \\"City of Golden Shadow\\"), the book is long on plot and short on in-depth character development.  <br /> <br />Let me explain. <br /> <br />As a reader, and fan, of Tad Williams' works, the opposite tends to be true.  He focuses, primarily, on a few highly borne out characters (Orlando, Renie, Simon, Miramele).  This can lead to sequences that, to the impatient reader, paint a very detailed caricature while moving the/a-semblance-of-a plot forward minimally.  Of course, as evidenced in \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\", even during those long initialization sequences, very pertinent information is divulged (eg the statues as visited by a young Simon). <br /> <br />In \\"Shadowmarch\\", the opposite track seems to have been taken.  Swarms of characters dart in and out (Briony, Barrick, Qinnitan, Chert, Chaven, Yassaminez, Flint, Vansen) in very short sequences-- most such 3rd person limited perspectives are 1-2 pages; the exception being Qinnitan whose 'perspectives' take an entire chapter (although even her average chapter length is only 7 pages).  This serves, in a contrarian form to his early works, to progress the well-thought out and multi-faceted plot forward at a swift clip (especially for Tad Williams).  However, and most disappointedly as I see it, only Briony and Chert are painted at more than 'sketch-level.'  Given that I was most compelled by  (and disappointed by his \\"absence\\" for long stretches) Barrick, I hope this changes later in the series. <br /> <br />In short, to advance plot more expediciously, Tad Williams has replaced depth of character with breadth of characters. <br /> <br />As a Tad Williams fan, I don't know that I like the trade-off.  However, when compared to the vast quantity of fantasy rubbish flying of bookshelves (some of which I've had the misfortune to read), this book as a whole stands up well. <br /> <br />Most importantly, I eagerly await the second volume.	2005-02-16

Instead, as I had done with Robin Hobb's excellent \\"Fool's Errand\\", I had hoped to read the first book from the new series and then, while awaiting book 2, read the first (2) series. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, for me, that will not occur.  Nor will a sojourn into book two (through a purported four) of this series. <br /> <br />I found the primary protagonist (Lianden) unempathetic (perhaps even pathetic) and, worse, the author's general writing ponderous and... lacking. <br /> <br />I, admittedly, can't attest to how this book stacks up to its predecessors.  I can only state that compared to its contemporaries that I have read (Steven Erikson, Robin Hobb, George RR Martin, Robert Jordan, to name a few), I found that it didn't stack up well at all.	2005-01-27

In Gardens of the Moon, the world of the Malazans was unfurled and the daunting potential of Steven Erikson became evident. <br /> <br />In Deadhouse Gates, book two of the series, the inimitable Chain of Dogs with Coltaine wrought and forged the universe into the fantasy series history books. <br /> <br />With Memories of Ice, amazingly, dazzingly, wondefully, Steven Erikson has bested the first two books in the series.  Perhaps, as a whole, better than the first two combined (but (admittedly) with singular event better than the closure of Coltaine's march). <br /> <br />Back are Ganoes Paran (my favorite), Whiskeyjack and Korlat and Anomanader Rake, Dujek and Quick Ben and Mallet and Troc.  Introduced are Itkovian and Gruntle and Stonny and Anaster and the Pannion Seer.  Additionally greater (much Greater) depth is given to the conflict between the Jaghut and T'lan Imass and the Tiste Andii (with a little mentioned of the the Tiste Edur). <br /> <br />The book, as is Erikson's hallmark, has a bitter end with several not-insignificant characters dying.  However, the tale holds together well. Very well. <br /> <br />The bottom line:  A classic series is expanded.  The whole of literature is the better for it.	2005-01-18

Not an excellent book	\\"Fitzpatrick's War,\\" the first novel by Theodore Judson, bodes well for a stellar career in the field of writing and literary commendation.  However, as engrossing as the tale is-with regards to that, please see either the book jacket or the description listed by Amazon-, I can't give it the highest possible ranking.   <br /> <br />To that point, and with that in mind, here are the highs and lows (at least from my perspective): <br /> <br />Some Highs: <br />*  Perfectly detailed and on-tap nuevo-Edwardian perspective by the protagonist (Bruce) <br />*  Amazingly humorous 'footnotes' throughout the book <br />*  Vivid portrayal of Bruce of Charlotte  <br />*  Solid and realistic, but too infrequent, character dialogue <br /> <br />Some Lows: <br />*   Numerous points throughout the book had multi-page long paragraphs.  At least in my case, I found myself \\"parsing\\" where the paragraphs could've either been abridged or terminated (and followed by another). <br />*   Overly long buildup to the actual war  (in comparison to time spent on the war and thereafter) <br />*   (While only 1 chapter, oxymoronically,) The hideously long and overly precise (77 charges anyone?) detailing of the War <br />*   Unnecessary interlude of the Universal Railroad chapter  <br />*   'The events of Chapter 19' <br /> <br />Make no bones about it, this is a good, original story.  It has spot on caricatures not against, imho, conservatism (as railed against in other reviews here on amazon) but, rather, the general costs of war and decadence that success in war often brings to societies; greed of/for power/money and the irony of off-shoring (or undercutting).   <br /> <br />Of all these, however, the most prevalent theme is the importance of love of family-- both immediate and extended. <br /> <br />That theme can not be told enough.	2004-12-24

River of Blue Fire, volume 2 in the Otherland series, presents me, a true Tad Williams fan, with a solid quandry:  do I continue with book 3 or end the pain now? <br /> <br />First, for the story, and it's review (summarized in one sentence (possible spoiler)):  The main characters split into three groups:  renie & !xabbu; orlando and pithlit/fredericks;  florimel, martine, et al.  They go from simulation to simulation and become progressively more frustrated at their inability to do... anything with regards to their for being on the net: either (a) rejoining Sellars or (b) finding their loved ones (aka Renie's brother).... OH wait, Paul Jonas, \\"Dread\\", Felix Jongleur have occassional intercessionals as well.  There is sporadic dialogue... And tremendous amounts of description. <br /> <br />Of course, I gloss over some really important points:  Orlando and Fredericks, as well as Paul, to me, are the character highlights.  I empathize with them.  Orlando: doomed with progeria (RL), meeting up with Fredericks a girl \\"simming\\" as boy; Paul, lost, banished (presumably a former Grail colleague, but no evidence to the point).   <br /> <br />Renie and !Xabbu?  About as interesting as a dinner of green peas.  Let me clarify:  It's not that their characters coudn't be interesting, it's that the specific scenarios the author utilizes them are... blaise... <br /> <br />Martine/Florimel/Quan Li/Sweet William/etc:  An interesting plot <br /> <br />Again, though, I do give credit for Tad Williams for one major point (worth 1 star of the 2 I credit this title): an exquisite plot that was before it's time:  use of an advanced internet; items that were \\"utilized\\" in the Matrix (which followed these titles); some elements of traditional suspense (detectives investigating Dread) and sci-fantasy... <br /> <br />Bottom line: for Williams' fans only... or those anticipating a long-convelescent period only.	2004-12-10

It does not, however, meet the lofty level of excellence that its predecessor, The Knight, met.  Whereas \\"The Knight\\" will retain its place on my shortlist of best fantasy novels ever written (and the top one of 2004), The Wizard is (merely) a good read. <br /> <br />Gone, in my estimation, are the intricacies of The Knight-- the striving to attain (or have accepted) Able's Knighthood; the heart-wrenching moments associated with the absence of Disiri; the subtle nuisances flowing through the text as a result of the protagonist's youth (but not Able's). <br /> <br />In its stead, are near-standard fantasy fair battles:  Jotunland, RedHall, the Five Fates (description only) and the concluding sequence.  And of them all, only the concluding, final chapter of the book (comprising, of course, the final battle) is exemplary.  And, as with many Wolfe novels, the end rushes in: a swift wind undeterred by a readers desire for a less abrupt cessation.  Additionally, the swift rise and sudden disappearance of Toug (and his centric views) and Mani (gotta love that Cat) were both hearteningly fresh and sorely noticed. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, this book is better than all but the finest of fantasy (or other fictional) work.  Its highpoints are very good:  the ruinous portrayal of Morcaine;  the torn relationship between Idnn and Svonn;  the tattered mind of  Etela's mother; Baki and Uri. <br /> <br />I can only hope that Wolfe returns to this universe.  It's worthy of more of his time just as The Wizard was worthy of mine.	2004-11-15

Unlike the predecessor, in which the plot sped at, somewhat, the expense of character depth, Erikson spends pronounced time exploring the new, or more deeply defining existing characters. <br /> <br />For example, Apsalar, Crokus, Fiddler and Kalam all return.  Fiddler and Kalam's role (and characters) are fleshed out to a much-fuller degree.  Apsalar still suffers from character gap, and Crokus, aside from unrequited infatuation with Apsalar, appears to be a mere bookmark.   Given that I liked Crokus' role in GotM, I was saddened by his relegation. <br /> <br />On the upside, however, are the newcomers:   Felisin, Duiker, Coltaine, Truth, etc. <br /> <br />Of course, the emotional apex of the story details the trail of tears associated with Coltain and the \\"Chain of Dogs\\".  While, in my opinion, there was, during the beginning portion of the novel, too much emphasis on *\\"graphic\\" descriptions* of death and destruction (and, thereby conversely, a reduction in the impact of the despair that was intended), the closing third of the book hit the morbid \\"nail on the head\\": a delicate balance of encroaching despair intermingled with abject, unrelenting hope.   <br /> <br />The series, it should be noted, is about the \\"Fallen.\\"  And the culmination of Duiker and Coltaine's story bears witness to that aspect.  Amazing stuff.   <br /> <br />Amazing read.	2004-11-03

I do suspect that Feist fans, the diehards, will love this book.  I am not a diehard Fiest fan, so I can make no such recommendation. <br /> <br />I will state the following, and I hope it helps the \\"fantasy genre fan\\".   <br /> <br />First, if you've not read book one (Talon of the Silver Hawk), and are inclined to read this tome, do so before beginning with this entry. <br /> <br />Second, with regards to the read itself, I found the beginning slow, and... contrived.  As it begins, Talon is not yet under the influence of Duke Kaspar; however, he must become so (as was elicited in book 1) to further the goals of the Conclave.  Instead of taking the open offer from the Duke; however, Talon decides it would be best to humiliate a royal Prince (albeit a \\"baffoon\\") first.  The rationale, while described by Feist in some detail, is the worst kind of \\"B plot\\",  Beyond contrived: just bad.  <br /> <br />Luckily for the reader, the book hits a high note (a very high \\"****\\", almost \\"*****\\" note) during the sequences wherein Talon is performing nefarious tasks for the Duke and, later, is ... not.  Additionally, the notes continue during the portions up-to those where he re-establishes full-contact with the Conclave. <br /> <br />During the final chapters, however, as Tal prepares to assault the Duke, the book loses steam and bluster.  It's gale wind has blown out, and instead, it weakly limps to a conclusion that is putridly saccharin.  Most open issues appear resolved at the end of book 2, with the exception of one (apparent, for Feist) \\"been there, done that\\" plot twist late in the book, and the \\"unknown whereabouts\\" of a character new to book 2. <br /> <br />Hopefully, in volume three, Feist will be able to resurrect the plot line(s) and character exposition so adroitly displayed during the mid-sections of this book.  If so, we, the reader(s) should be in for a treat.  If not....	2004-09-13

These all return, and The Charnel Prince extends this list by at least 2 characters, albeit one of them has a very trivial role (Eohawk).    <br /> <br />In the vein of both Tad Williams, George RR Martin and Robert Jordan, the third person limited perspective shifts frequently (in this case, with every chapter).  Sadly, due to the quantities of characters, and in part, the \\"light\\" writing style of the author, I felt no empathy for them.  Even Cazio, my favorite character in book TBK, is relegated to a second or third tier role.  His replacements, Leoff and Muriel and (minimal) Eohawk were short shrift in comparison. <br /> <br />Furthermore, gone, from this book, were the emotional gravitas moments of its predecessor:  Neil's ill-fated love of Fastia; Anne's anguish at banishment/youthful exuberence for Rhoderick; Aspar's anguish with Winna.  And the conflict, if it were, with the Gryffin. <br /> <br />Instead, Aspar's party are transformed into psuedo-superheroes:  never truly threatened (one exception to one character)); a love angle (currently tangental at best) was added.  Neil flounders (one sequence excepted) and Leoff, a newbie,  is of questionable worth. <br /> <br />The first half of the book compounds these limitations:  the book is lifeless.  It appears Keyes' was strumming the motions: working from dialogue sequence to dialogue sequence while waiting for the book's crescendo to near.   <br /> <br />Pleasantly, that crescendo did arrive, and the last \\"part\\" of the book rescues it.  As with a championship team that struggles for 3 quarters before finding their way in the end, so too veers this book, if but barely.   <br /> <br />Of note:  I added an additional \\"*\\" (for totalof 3) to the review in large part due to my affinity for The Briar King and hope that book 3 rekindles the fire.	2004-09-09

Stirling's books that I have read, is a very good read.   <br /> <br />Of course, as with most \\"alternative history\\" books, the basic premise-- cause: unexplained-- requires the most fundamental tenet of a fictional work:  the tremendous acceptance of suspended disbelief.   Given that the catalyst, the Change, requires the cessation (apparently world-wide) of all modern electrical amenities and a slight-shift (non-fatal) of Physical properties such that neither Steam compression nor Gun-Powder work as they do \\"currently\\", this is no small task.   <br /> <br />However, if you do accept that cessation, the rest of the book's idiosyncrasies (eg an inexplicable assortment of \\"well-placed\\" people with \\"rare\\" skills (Farrier's, Swordsmen, Black Smiths, former Black Ops soldiers, Wiccans) is easy to overlook. <br /> <br />This, of course, is a good thing.  As the two primary protagonists, Juniper McKenzie and Mike Havel, are two thoroughly enjoyable and pre-eminently readable characters.  Junipers belief system (Wiccan) embodies her chapters (some would say \\"nauseatingly so\\"); however, it provides ample justification for her actions (and corresponding motives) throughout her segments.  Additionally, Mike Havel's military background is left (pleasantly) under-stated in thought-process, but not so in/through his courses of action. <br /> <br />Finally, the brief interaction between the two protagonists is intriguing.  There is definitively a \\"connection\\" that would seem to require further interaction in the future sequels (two planned). <br /> <br />If there are qualms (and there are few books without them) outside those listed at the outset of this review, they involve, perhaps, the contrasting desolation caused by the massive post-Change die off and the large quantities of armed, warring factions that square off at the end.  This is especially disparate given the \\"short\\" 9-10month timeframe of the book.  I, perhaps, had more issues with this compressed timeframe juxtaposed against the near-immediate mini-rebuildup then the entire premise (aka the Change). <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I was enthralled with the read, and hope it portents well for the sequels.  Finally, I reviewed the book with a tilt of 4++ stars, hence, an overall rating of 5.	2004-08-25

Besides his well known \\"Dragonlance\\" series (co-authored with Margaret Weiss), I also found his solo novel \\"The Immortals\\" to be a tremendous effort.  However, I never \\"clicked\\" with this novel. <br /> <br />I found Galen, one of the 3-4 protagonists, to be \\"whiny\\".  I found Mimic to be aptly named (a positive) and insufficiently detailed.  Additionally, Dwynnwyn, the faery portent, was (initially) stoically presented.  By the end, she's running roughshod (albeit through means not of her own) over the humoursly recalcitrant Xian. <br /> <br />And perhaps that is the gist of it:  the book is ~420 pages.  It has 3 (again, at least) protagonists, large (easily readable) typeface, and, as a result, none of them are fleshed out.  While each viewpoint, ala George RR Martins A Sword of Fire and Ice series, drives the plot forward, there are still great, inexplicable \\"gaps\\" in the storyline.  <br /> <br />To whit: if Galen is \\"unaware\\" of his \\"mystic power\\" and \\"Deep Magic\\", how does he facilitate the end game (of book 1)? <br /> <br />I suppose, in reading this critique, it may be asked why the book didn't garner \\"*\\" versus \\"***\\".  At least that part is easily explainable: <br />(a) I like the author(s), and am more than willing to cede at least one extra point for that alone and <br />(b) the last portion of the book, \\"Warriors\\", rised substantially above the muck (but not dreck) that precedes it.  A \\"****\\" quadrant to conclude the book. <br /> <br />And perhaps that's the summary:  Disappoingtly average muck that rises substantially at the end; enough so that I, at the least, will read volume 2.	2004-08-13

His book \\"The War of the Flowers\\", imho, was the best of 2003 in Fantasy.  Additionally, his Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy ranks among modern fantasy's best. <br />Moreover, I love both the Sci-Fi and Fantasy genres.  Hence, I was excited to pick up the first book of Otherland (City of Golden Shadow).  <br />I was braced to  slog through the first few hundred pages of his prose.  It's part of the Tad Williams prose \\"schtick\\".  (It proved no different in this book, btw)<br />Additionally, I have to give kudos for a book that pre-dated, but yet mirrors (at high level) some of the plot points of \\"The Matrix\\"-- the concept of a VR world where we fully \\"jack in\\" (to the point of not being aware that we ARE \\"jacked in\\") that was published in Jan 1998 and, therefore, written prior to it, is pure evidence of Tad's vast imagination.<br />However, I found myself loathing every single chapter involving Renie.  To me, her plot is as engaging as boiling Turnips (eg not very).  <br />Further, while I like(d) !Xabbu, I found myself doing a mental \\"search & replace\\" operation from Mr. Williams earlier MST trilogy:  \\"Look!

The volumes seems more focused and driven, while, at the same time, not losing the meticulous prose that is his hallmark.<br />Indeed, Severian's tale has him travelling from north of Thrax, through the corridors of time, and, ultimately, back to the Citadel of the Autarch.  I don't think it unfair to state that Severian, in this tale, doesn't achieve consummate happiness. As with the first book, he seems to radiate health for the unwell and (as with Angela Lansbury in 'Murder She Wrote') unhappiness for those near (up to and including) himself. <br />At the least, some of the mysteries of the tetralogy are resolved late in the book (4).  Given Mr. Wolfe's style, it is not surprising that the book is 'thick' despite being a mere 400 pages.  Nonetheless, I found it disappointing that the ending seemed rushed: an &quot;I need 20 more pages&quot; theme seemed to carry it.   Hence, in this reviewers eyes, it ended with a whimper and not a bang.<br />The bottom line: I would recommend 'The Book of the New Sun' (both books, comprised of four volumes).  I don't know that I would equate it to the literary masterpieces on its jacket as Wolfe, through his protagonist, does not use the vocabulary of the common man.  This will, I fear, cause this tale to fade in its being read.  And that would be a great loss.	2004-05-07

Ilium begins -- through approximately half of its volume-- as a most excellent, 5-star book set, at least partially, in a future environment with the Trojan war, Greek gods and goddesses, and semi-sentient logo- and bio-spheres.  The stage is intriguing, the characters are well-done, and the 'what's going on here' factor is at its foremost.<br />At that point, however, Ilium loses some thunder and dips into 'standard mass fiction fare'.   The characterizations are tossed out the window, if you will, in lieu of (at least partially implausible) scenarios involving nuclear explosions, and one antagonist that appears directly lifted from the LotR (Gollum), albeit with a different name.  *However*, despite dipping into the lighter fare of pulp-fiction, it's still a good read (by those standards).<br />Now, with that being said, it presents the reader (and this reviewer) with a conundrum: do I review with the more abject, and 'stodgy' science fiction genre or with the fluffy, pulp-fiction popcorn fare?  With the former, it's a 3-star book; the latter? a 5-star book.<br />So, I'll take the middle-road and rate it with 4 stars and this caveat:  I hope, in volume 2, Dan Simmons adheres more closely to the style and implementation of the first portion of Ilium.  That portion was-- is-- legendary.	2004-04-26

Quite the contrary, unlike legendary works by Tolkien (admitted 20th century master of Fantasy) or Dickens (to whom he's compared on the book jacket) or Hemmingway, Gene Wolf's works are not pre-eminently accessible to the common man.  <br />Now, with that being said, this isn't to say that books should be on the ubiquitous 6th grade-level or that Gene Wolf's work is not excellent in the abstract, impressionistic, stream-of-consciousness sense of the word.  <br />However, not disclaiming the aforementioned caveat would be, itself, a tremendous oversight by a reviewer.  <br />Additionally, while the author's metaphorical prowess is astounding--- such as an entire play serving as a chapter in the Claw book while,too, apocryphically detailing the entire mythos of the series-- so, too, is the author's (or, as it's first person, the protagonist's) amazing inability to have any semblance of a conclusion to each of the (original) books.  <br />As with a rambling speaker that loses his audience due to tangental gambits, so too do(es) the book(s) digress and diverge before coming an amazingly abrupt ending.<br />I found myself torn between my full appreciation of Gene Wolf's linguistic mastery and those sections of the book that fleshed out characters such as Dorcas, Jonas and Jolenta (among others), while despising those sections, which, to date--perhaps resolved in the concluding volume(s)-- should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br />Where's the lithium?  The book(s) need(s) it.	2004-04-07

Period.<br />Without giving away too much of the plot-- as with good liquor, the plot is better when it's distilled at its own pace, I feel it sufficient to state that the story (written in the first-person perspective) involves a 'boy', from America he who ends up somewhere else (Mythgartr) by a manner he's not familiar for reasons of which he's unsure.  As he 'grows', he's embued with preternatural, near-Herculean strength physically, but still maintains the perspective of a youth.<br />It's a magnificient tale: much closer in scale to the legendary Tristan/Tristam and written by a master's hand,  I await the second, and concluding, book with high hopes, and the highest of expectations.<br />Marvelous!  Simply marvelous!	2004-03-15

Well worth the Adventure	First, I should state that I love the Wheel of Time series, but, amazingly, had not read the novella &quot;New Spring&quot;.  Hence, while having a general knowledge of New Spring's, this was a first pass for me.<br />And, with it, I found an amazingly fun read.  It helps that it concentrates its focus on Moiraine (my favorite Aes Sedai from the Wheel of Time series) and Lan.  Besides being of a quicker pace-- and of a size more akin to standard fiction then Fantasy fiction-- then some recent WoT primary novels, it sheds valuable insight into several key facets of Wheel of Time (minor spoilers, don't read):  <BR>* a certain, fundamental Aes Sedai ritual<BR>* The role of the Black Ajah (make sure you track who is Black Ajah)<BR>* Some insight into the relationship/mindset of Moiraine, Siuan and Lan<br />All in all, a great book, serving as either a good introduction to Wheel of Time, or an excellent back story to help (in my mind) ultimately tie-up some sure to be loose-ends at the end of the main Wheel of Time story.	2004-01-15

I should state that I read a good bit of Fantasy fiction, including some of Mr. Williams other books, and do generally consider him, Robin Hobb, George RR Martin and Robert Jordan to be the apex of current fantasy writing.  <br />With that being caveat, it should not be surprising that just as that Tad Williams' prior books tended to focus on in depth-characterization and setting, rather than raw action or discordant perspectives (Martin), so too does 'The War of the Flowers'.  Moreover, 'The War of the Flowers' utterly succeeds within that caveat.  <br />Set in the land of 'Faerie', a mortal, Theo Vilmus, arrives through suspect means.  A 'loser' at ~ age 30 in 'mortalia' prior to his advent, Theo comes of age while unwillingly, and to some degree, unwittingly, assisting in a civil war.<br />This relatively simple story succeeds in several outstanding ways:  <BR>(1) It, like many non-Fantasy fictional brethren, is told in 1 book-- and not scattered over many.<BR>(2) The setting is fabulous:  Sprites, Nixies, Doonies, Goblins, Grims, et al.  In place, used 'accurately'.  The class warfare(neo-marxist???)/condemnation of industralization may, to some, go over the top, but it's appropriate for the Neo-Victorian backdrop of Faeries<BR>(3) The primary Protagonist is fabulous:  Theo, as with Simon way back in 'The Memory...' Trilogy, is an angst-ridden, relatively indecisive ne'er-do-well at the beginning, who successfully migrates to adulthood by the end (nevermind that he's 30 to begin with as age doesn't make one an 'adult').<BR>(4) The secondary characters are outstanding, with special kudos to both Hellebore and Applecore.  <br />This book sat on my bookshelf for nearly 5 months before I read it.  What a mistake.  Being followed closely by only &quot;Golden Fool&quot; by Robin Hobb, this is unquestionably the best Fantasy book of 2003.  Finally, while it was self-contained in only1 volume, I assuredly hope Tad Williams revisits the land and time he created.  Wonderful.  Magnificient.	2003-12-01

Lots of people have appropriately eviscerated portions of this book for being (often eggregriously) inaccurate.  However, it's marked as fiction, and not non-fiction, so I don't see why that would prove surprising.  At it's best, in terms of analogies, I would think this is fictionally equivalent to the movie &quot;JFK&quot;.  In other words, potentially intriguing, mostly enjoyable, but horrifically flawed in terms of the interconnection of key 'facts.'<br />With that being said, the I actually found this book to be patently absurd for reasons specific to its fictional elements within the Thriller genre.<br />Essentially, the *entire* book comes down to this sequence (in broad generalizations so as not to spoil it anymore than other reviews have):<br />*  &lt;&lt;initial setup&gt;&gt;<br />*  Arrive at Location<br />*  Pontificate in a manner and breadth that no human ever would<br />*  &lt;&lt;repeat steps 2-3 incessantly&gt;&gt;<br />*  &lt;&lt;conclusion&gt;&gt;<br />Oh yes, and all of this is done in one day, with no appreciable, discernible, inferrential loss of stamina or lucidity among the primary protagonists.  It's stultifyingly amazing!<br />Perhaps instead of a 'thriller' for his next book, Dan Brown could write a fitness manual that prescribes the appropriate mix of exercise and gensing to achieve and maintain these levels.  NOW that would be a book worth reading.	2003-10-27

However, it took me but a little while (read 1-2 chapters) to get fully enraptured in the series again-- despite the sabatical.  The book--without divulging plot-- truly begins well.  <br />Why then 3 stars?  It runs out of gas, for lack of a better analogy.  The book is subdivided into segments (4, I believe).  The first 2 are excellent.  3 is short.  4, not surprising, containing the ending, peters out.  <br />Worst of all is the \\"Animal House\\"-esque epilogue (don't read till the end, of course).  I didn't, nor don't still, know what to make of it.  It left a foul taste in my mouth: did the editors force it into the book?  Or did they (editors), rather, prune it to the length present?  Don't get me wrong:  it's not hideous (no Ace-Ventura \\"laces out\\" scene or anything), but it's totally unnecessary.  Baagh!  Such a bitter center!  <br />Ahh, then, the final statement:  Baron Shadamerh is an excellent character!  His and Alise' interactions are among the best modelled (& most enjoyable to read) relationships to the fantasy-genre in a while.  <br />Their segments, alone, make the book worthy of reading!<br />Bottom line:  If you're a Weiss & Hickman fan, get it.  If you've read the predecessors, read it.  If you're curious, read it.  If, however, you're only looking for \\"best of breed\\"....	2003-09-01

To Green Angel Tower (the entirety, comprised, in my case, of books 1 and 2 in paperback) is a monumental work.  The entire 'trilogy' of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is excellent along with it.<br />I try to avoid plot spoilers in reviews-- I don't think it's important or helpful to say \\"Gaah! so and so died\\" or \\"Phew! So and so made it\\".  After all, who wants to read a book if all the salient points are foreknown ?  <br />With that caveat, what can I say about TGAT?  The book is exhausting in all the appropriate visaages.  Tad Williams is the master of the minutae--not plodding minutae, mind you-- that tie together to form a cohesive masterpiece.  There were some loops thrown--especially with regards to Cameris--, Seoman/Simon was a marvel--no, a joy-- to read about (although his sections seemed, to me, too few), Miramele aged appropriately for a lady in her mid/late teens, and Josua-Isgrimnur-Jiriki-Binibak-Cadrach were delightful, but, in the end, the end came too quickly.<br />I suppose, given the fact that the book, as a whole, is nearly 1600 pages, that itself is a stunning statement.  It's not an action thriller-- dooming it for those who prefer such fare--, nor does it delve to deeply in the romance aspect (perhaps even too little, in my opine), but it does form its own raptorous melody.<br />The bottom line?  Memory, Sorrow and Thorn forms one of the great Fantasy series.  There's a lot of crap in the genre, and this series, and this book, helps dispel their collective bad air.	2003-08-09

What a mistake to wait!  What a fantastic read!<br />Caveat: this book is definitely not for everyone, nor is it perfect.  I would presume that those who like short sentences, terse descriptions and endless, mindless action coupled with formulaic plots (such as in the Sword of Truth series) will probably find this book stifling.  Moreover, I'm presuming the rest of the series (which I haven't read yet) would be likewise off limits.<br />For those who are outside the constraints above-- those who might, or do, for example, enjoy the forays into Robin Hobb's delectable works-- this book proves the building, budding, cresting wave set to soak the nearest beach.  <br />As noted elsewhere, it slowly churns through the first few hundred pages: each of those early pages ripe with information and minutae and glorious detail, though.  As the book proceeds, however, the storyline, as with a wave, rises up, the pages turn endlessly, instantly, until the glorious crush upon the shore... its stunning, fantastic, ending.  Book 2, here I come.<br />Bottom line?  Read it, enjoy it!	2003-07-11

Further, as with many of his works, it takes a while to build into the story.  Specifically, the second quarter of the book is somewhat laborious.<br />Nonetheless, the onset-- set in Britain, for pre-enslaved Succat-- and the closing (scenes again set in Britain and in Rome) are very strong.  <br />Obviously, the work is set as historical fiction. Moreover, doing so with the patron saint of Ireland is risky business.  However, the portrayed humanization of St. Patrick is pulled off, with one  exception, in excellent form.  His sojourn from rakehell to 'hero' to broken man is a chronicle worth reading.  With that said, the final contrivance that leads Patrick to return Ireland borders (but does not quite crest) on being 'over the top'.  <br />Given the quality of the rest of the book, that's a shame.<br />Bottom line:  BUY THE BOOK.  READ THE BOOK.  ENJOY THE STORY.	2003-05-30

It's does, however, bode well for the series.  I won't delve into the plot, per se, except to highlight what I feel to be the author's strong point(s).  Namely, his inter-character dialogue and plot-pacing.  He does not, for good or ill, spend quantities of space detailing places, or even people.  Rather, as an 'impressionist', he merely outlines them and allows the mind's eye of each reader to fill in the rest.  This is markedly different then, say, Jordan or Martin (to whom this author/book is most frequently compared).  <br />In closing, I will state that Cazio is a 5 '*' character.  I looked forward to reading his section(s) as I have few others in recent memory.  Frequently, I found myself laughing at loud.  Excellent!  Beyond excellent: fantastic!	2003-05-21

There are a thousand, or so, negative reviews of Crossroads of Twilight, and, having just finished the book, I had to wonder if the collective &quot;we&quot; had read the same book.   Here it is in a nutshell:  anyone who's reading CoT is best apprised to insure that the first nine books are read first.  Assuredly, *not* doing that would force this book into a literary abyss.  <br />Now to my point, before reading Crossroads of Twilight, I did reread, in order, all the previous 9 books.  #10, to the authors intent, flows as a good wine into a beckoning chalice.  Surely, those who favor titanic &quot;Falme&quot; like scenes will not find their sanction here.  Nor fans of Rand, per se.  But Perrin, Egwene and Elayne shine... and... Light... Mat!  He shines as the morning sun on a brisk spring morning.    <br />This book does, indeed, go through the nuances of each of the aforementioned characters.  I suppose many people don't like that.  I suppose there's a little Mack Bolan fan in me as well.  To the point of this book, though, I found that the more--effort-- I expended in reading it the more I was rewarded.  Make no bones about it, save for Mat, this is a thick book to read (and I'm not talking about the length).<br />But, in major storms, such as hurricanes, many of us know, an &quot;eye&quot; passes over at roughly after some modicum of the storm has moved.  It can be at the midpoint, earlier or later.  Regardless, that eye allows for a brief respite, yet is coupled with the foreknowledge that another storm side is on its way.  That the often cloudless clear blue skies belie the end.  No, we realize, they harbinge it.<br />So too with Crossroads of Twilight and the Wheel of Time series.  Excellent!	2003-04-20

Book 2 of the Tawny Man series is everything that book 2s from Robin Hobb should be and generally are.  What does that mean?  She makes, it seems, book 2's her epicenter.  A lot happens.  Little gets resolved.<br />However, where she excels-- where she *exceeds*-- is drawing the vivid portrayal of characters.  In this case, as with Fool's Errand and the Farseer Trilogy before it, in the first person perspective of protagonist FitzChivalry Farseer aka Tom Badgerlock.<br />I won't give away a thing of the plot, suffice it to say that the book jacket's contents, provided by Amazon here, are all you need to know.  That and, if you haven't done so already, pick up Fool's Errand and read it first (if not the Farseer and Liveship series).<br />This is a wonderful book.  I absorbed it and loved it.  I await eagerly book 3.	2003-01-03

It (of course) was very good.  In fact, it was jolly well enough to compell me to read the originating Farseer trilogy.  The first book (Assassin's Apprentice) was OK-- a 3.5 star effort-- a good start to a series.<br />Royal Assassin, however, is a different beast.  Whereas Assassin's Apprentice was a good, but not great, beginning, Royal Assassin is the consummate trilogy midpoint.  A 5-star effort in every sense (think: \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" kind of mid-trilogy effort), leaving disappointment only in it  ending & heaving empathic protagonist-despair.  <br />Both expected, of course-- being the calling card of a trilogy-- but also excellently implemented.<br />Are there hairs to split?  Of course.  The Fool is, perhaps, way too heavy with the ranting which, empathetically, is a huge stepdown from his portrayal in book 1; Regal, a pleasant villain, is portrayed as both amazingly vainglorious and treachoroulsy thorough-> a good character point, but, in my eyes, left slightly lacking in portrayal; Molly, accurately--to fault-- painted in puppy-dog/first-love love eyes... but these are minor quibbles.<br />Again, though, the book is a good read, solid read.  It is a strong step forward from its predecessor and left me wanting more.  Those are sure signs of an investment well made.	2002-11-18

However, it was far more than that.<br />It was a gripping, epic read  (nearly 1000pp).  It was, again, over the top with sex -- it sometimes seems that GRRM uses it as filler--, violence and intrigue.  It only occassionally dipped in to the \\"not again\\" syndrome (ie, how many times can someone almost, but not quite meet somebody else that they were searching for).  <br />And-- going back to the protagonist killing machine that is reputed to be GRRM-- there are some \\"shocking\\" deaths that, upon reflection, really aren't that shocking.  If anything, GRRM seems reticient to kill off \\"antagonists\\" and ever willing to dole out the \\"splash\\" of magic to put the word \\"fantasy\\" in this \\"war of the roses\\" inspired, expanded & delivered upon delight.<br />It's book 3 in a reported-to-be 6 book series.  It's grim.  It's dark.  It's interim and self-standing.<br />As such, is it better than Jordan, or Tolkien, as some have claimed?  That's really the wrong question.  The right question is: why can't more authors fill the fantasy field with the same high quality that the above, and GRRM, do ?  Followed closely by: when is book 4 due ?<br />Bottom line:  An excellent-- nay, legendary-- addition to a classic series.  Buy it. Read it.  Enjoy it.	2002-09-22

A friend of mine suggested I pickup George RR Martin during a &quot;downtime&quot; of reading.  Boy, what a great suggestion!  The first book in the series, The Game of Thrones, was excellent.  <br />As is my wont, that tends to make me a little suspicious. After all, with such a high level having been set by the predecessor, it's very difficult to maintain the level of excellence.<br />My fears quickly abated, though, as I delved into this book.  <br />It is darker book than book1-- perhaps because, after the success of book 1, GRRM decided to expand the series?  No rousing finish here.  Instead, the book grimly, stupendously, marches onward hewing characters (*mostly* minor in this tome) as timber.  <br />In the process, &quot;major&quot; characters are fleshed out giving life and breadth and breath to their motions, intuitions and actions. Cersei becomes less wooden, Catelyn more human, Sansa less &quot;doll&quot;-like, Arya more rogue-ish (and the perspective GRRM obtains in writing as a &quot;10yr old&quot; is excellent).  Jon?  Tyrion? The best....<br />Bottom Line?  An excellent edition in an excellent series.  Wonderful.	2002-09-15

It's fairly amazing to me that I'd still, from time to time, search on 'Sargent' to see if she'd ever written the third book.  The pleasant surprise at seeing she had can not be overstated.<br />What was also exhilarating to me was how-- prodded reflectively by the author-- I was able to recall the first two novels read nearly a decade and a half ago.  That alone was worth the trip.  However, to be frank, the book is a *good* read.    <br />How to describe it?  It is a character novel. Specifically, a novel on the entirety of the protagonist's Mahala's life-- her choices, the people with whom she interacts, etc.  It's interweavon nicely with a science fiction thread dealing with the fate of Venus, the Habbers, Earth and, ultimately, all of humanity.<br />As such, it's a good thing that Sargent's strength in this novel is the fine, yet gentle literary tapestry of characters, future 'plausible' science, and, quite frankly, leveraged strength wrought from the legacy of the first two novels.<br />If anything, the weakness in the books-- borne out in the closing 50 or so pages-- seems to be the cause of the delay in writing the third book (12 years? 13 years?): namely, how to end it.  After all, the trilogy, at least from a Sci Fi standpoint, is about terraforming venus. of course, I'm not going to divulge that here.<br />bottom line?  It's a good read.  If you haven't read the first two books, SHAME ON YOU.  Get them.  Read them all.  Enjoy them.	2002-07-07

In fact, I did like it; hence a 3 star effort.  <br />However, I was unable to get over a couple of issues I had with the first book that were not addressed in the second;  or that were not quite as good in the second.<br />For example, if you loved Grunthor in the first book; be prepared to be disappointed.  He's just not *present*.  <br />Second, if you liked Gwyddion (or Ashe), be prepared to say, at the end of the book, \\"what\\" ?  Suffice it to say, that I nearly tossed the book out following the \\"pearl of no memory\\" scene.  Rubbish.  Not the discussions (or the implicit outcome), but the explicit outcome?  No memory?  What is this, the Bobby \\"all of last season was a dream\\" Ewing from Dallas those many years ago redux?  <BR>And even Achmed, who I admittedly loathe, was reduced in plot scope, and into an obvious bowl of silent, lurking, but emotionally quivering jelly for Rhapsody.  I mean, if there's anything that Achmed is, it's the antithesis of Rhapsody.   As selfless as she is, he is selfish.  But no, I'm wagering that instead expanding the character scope to bring Achmed someone himself... the author will  keep the scope limited.<br />Finally, and most startlingly, I never felt the characters-- outside of the ancillary ones like Ashe and Jo-- were in danger.  It was like 3 super(wo)men with no Kryptonite in the universe.  <br />Hence, while the book was a good read, it didn't really thrive on any front:  it annoyed me that the intro that so enthralled me in book 1 is *still*, to a degree, left ludicrously open; it annoyed me that the characters who I loathed, but enjoyed reading, in book one were unloathable in book 2 (and that's a bad thing); it annoyed me that the romance, perhaps explicit, lead to nothing; it annoyed me that a book that could've been one for the ages just didn't quite hit the notes for which it was trying. <br />Bottom line: if you liked booked one, get book 2.  If you were so-so on book 1, don't.<br />As for me, will I read book three? I own it, so someday.  Perhaps when the pearl of \\"no memory\\" is returned to me.	2002-06-17
US	51758643	RT0GW52PWX72A	0812570812	953091978	Rhapsody : Child of Blood	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Very good effort!	Rhapsody starts with an amazingly compelling introduction.  I-- a veteran of Jordan, Goodkin, Lawhead, Weiss &amp; Hickman, etc-- was immediately drawn into the series by the 'Overture' section.  Had the book continued at the level of the 'overture', the book would've warranted more than 5 stars. <br />Instead, it bogs down in a few places, shows a 'Goodkin' tendency to make 'supermen' out of the main characters, and doesn't have an overtly taught plot line.<br />Be that as it may, the book *is* a very good read.  <br />I very much liked Rhapsody and Gunthor and, ultimately, Ashe.  Achmed?  Perhaps.  Frankly, Haydon excels at inter-character banter and emotive descriptions.  Achmed's soliloquies, though infrequent, near the end of the book seemed estranged.  For example, I found myself asking, is he in love with Rhapsody?  Or does he just love her as a Brother?<br />I suppose the uncertainty of knowledge is a good thing.  It even ties into some of the thematic elements in the book.<br />The bottom line:  As Haydon's first work, it's excellent.  I'm looking forward to reading the remainder of the series.  Buy it and read it today.	2002-06-14

I had read the original dragonlance sixpence during their first arrival nearly 1.5 decades ago.  I also remember vividly seeing this book in the local bookstore upon publication;  however, silly me, I skipped over it then.  Needless to say, I had left the Dragonlance series behind for a long time until I played Baldur's Gate II this past year, and, amazingly, that rekindled my spirit.  Armed with a freshened spirit, I purchased and (re)read the Annotated Chronicles.   This time thru, however, Sturm's impact was perhaps bigger on me.  I could wait not longer.  As such, I bought this book.<br />It was an excellent read.  Being his first novel, I was reminded (at the risk of blasphemy) 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was also a first novel.<br />Yes, there were discrepancies in total actuality between this story and the &quot;myth&quot; of Huma as relayed in the Chronicles.  However, the author tried to dispel that in two ways (a) in the preface by Astinus and (b) in various junkets throughout the book by referencing how the-then-already-spreading legend wasn't entirely meshing with fact.  <br />Neither detracts from the story--or from the Chronicles themselves.  Rather, Huma is seemingly a poignant, uber-Sturm.  Very much human, but driven to a higher calling.  <br />Do I have qualms with the book?  Sure.  Are they worth relaying?  No.  Read the book.  It's worth your time.	2001-06-26
US	51758643	R26WTFAPDNQPB6	0061057541	18473604	Byzantium	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Excellent Lawhead Work!	At nearly 900 pages, this is a monumental work.  Having read earlier Lawhead works (Arthur series, Endless Knot series), and been very impressed, I was still dubious of this work initially.  After all, I found  Pendragon (book 4 of the Arthur series) to be rather, well, average.<br />Fear  Not!<br />From beginning to end, Byzantium is Lawhead's single most consummate  book.  Aidan, the protagonist, is enthralling.  If the book has a weakness,  it is the rush with which it ends.<br />Considering the excellence of the  proceeding 800 (or so) pages, this is a trite complaint.	1999-12-17
