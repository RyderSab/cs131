It is not a &quot;well-made&quot; novel, though, and it may help to recall the willful craziness of &quot;Jesus' Son,&quot; which made similar demands on the reader.  Where the earlier book was a collection of interrelated stories, &quot;The Name of the World&quot; is one long first-person narrative, devoid of chapter breaks, which meanders all over the map--the basic strategy is more or less the same, though.  It's a &quot;mess,&quot; but I'm certain the mess is deliberate, and the narrative is hypnotically effective.  Far from a failure, it strikes me as a book by a very confident writer at the top of his game.	2001-10-14

History has shown that dictatorial governments prefer to hide their real intentions behind hypocritical rhetoric; they would not be so obvious as to call a retirement center &quot;the Home of the Useless&quot; (oh, please), as Rand does here.  Why, in a society presumably devoid of religion, does the narrator keep referring to his &quot;sins&quot;?  And in all seriousness, I can't see how a government could last for more than two days if it allowed its citizens to make love only once a year.  Wasn't there an editor around to bring up these questions?<br />The plot is constructed in such a way as to telegraph every twist well in advance, as if Rand were afraid of losing the reader.  Any half-way alert reader should be able to guess what will come of the narrator's pivotal encounter with the Home of the Scholars.  One wonders why the vaultingly intelligent (or so we're told) narrator did not see it coming as well.<br />This book made me giggle.  The &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;-ish speech that closes the book is embarassingly overbaked.  The romance sub-plot also reaches rare heights of corniness.  Ah, young love:  &quot;We stood still; for the first time did we know fear, and then pain.  And we stood still that we might not spill this pain more precious than pleasure.&quot;<br />Whatever the merits of Objectivism, it does not seem to promote the creation of fine literature.  Or even decent sci-fi.	2001-09-16

This is one of the best examples of the stream of consciousness technique I've ever come across; despite the absence of chapters or paragraph breaks, the prose is extremely readable.  It's a bitterly funny book (the rant about how domesticated dogs are destroying the world is the most hilarious thing I've read in some time), but it's the genuinely unsettling finale that puts this book into the top tier of modern novels.  An absolutely first-rate book; don't let Bernhard's reputation as a difficult &quot;experimental&quot; writer scare you away from it.	2001-09-09

Definitely not your average crime novel, it's heavy on quirky grit but surprisingly thin on plot; very little actually happens if you leave out the characters' seemingly random conversations.  It's not hard to see why David Lynch found this prime material for one of his oddball cinematic experiments (he was responsible for the 1990 film adaptation), but as a novel, &quot;Wild at Heart,&quot; though harmless fun, is just too breezy to leave much of an impression.	2001-08-21

Ballard takes a patently out-there concept--a gang of car-crash enthusiasts who derive erotic pleasure from getting maimed in accidents--and makes it vivid and compelling, if not exactly plausible.  Written in tightly coiled prose reminiscent of Don DeLillo, &quot;Crash&quot; seems excessively repetitive with all these endless descriptions of carnal doings in smashed-up cars, but keep in mind that a book about obsessive behavior perhaps ought to be obsessive in its execution.  This is a gutsy book, one that makes &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; look like Oprah Book Club material.  (I found myself wondering how Ballard managed to get it published at all.  I even found myself wondering how he managed to stay out of jail.)  It is not for everyone, but for adventurous readers it is a memorably wild ride through the dark side of the human psyche.	2001-06-27

It's a very short book that you will likely wish were shorter.  But though the plot goes (by design) nowhere, and the book is stuffed with the kind of affected whimsy employed by writers far too impressed with their own intelligence, there is some witty, bouncy prose to enjoy and a few inspired comic moments.

Sontag is, of course, primarily an essayist, and the book is at its best whenever she's just musing on various subjects.  &quot;If war did not satisfy an elementary desire--not the desire to destroy, which is superficial, but the desire to be in a state of strain, to feel more intensely--the practice of war would have been tried once and abandoned.&quot;  But this is &quot;thought provoking&quot; in the worst sense--more of a lecture than a fully realized novel.  The book is full of aphorisms, but the characters and events tend to be unconvincing (such as the narrator's unlikely detour into movie acting).  It is finally undramatic and lifeless; monotony sets in well before the end.  It comes off like a second-rate version of Andre Gide's &quot;The Immoralist.&quot;	2001-05-08

A certain moral outrage is evident nonetheless.  The mental health industry does not come off well at all (Frumkin's institution is unfavorably compared to the one depicted in &quot;One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest&quot;).  It's difficult not to come away with the impression that a little less bureaucratic negligence might have saved Miss Frumkin many wasted years.  Fortunately, this is not a one-sided screed (not quite, anyhow):  some of these medics and bureaucrats are just doing the best they can with the limited resources on hand.<br />The prose style is plain and straightforward--maybe a little flat-footed, too.  But overall, the book is a good example of how facts can speak for themselves.	2001-04-29

You might call it the Cliff's Notes version of Mao, intended for people who want only the really important bits from charmingly titled tomes like &quot;People of the World, Unite and Defeat the U.S. Aggressors and All Their Lackeys.&quot;<br />I've always heard about &quot;Maoism,&quot; and now that I've read the so-called Little Red Book, I'm still not certain what distinguishes Mao's ideology from run-of-the-mill Marxism-Leninism.  Many of the Quotations are merely edicts for keeping the troops in line; when he plunges into philosophical matters (see Section 22), he's really just offering over-simplified Marx.  Mao was probably an extremely intelligent man, but a Deep Thinker he was not:  &quot;We should support whatever the enemy opposes and oppose whatever the enemy supports.&quot;<br />Lastly, &quot;Quotations&quot; is irritatingly repetitive.  I'd estimate that one-fourth of these quotes could have been eliminated with no real loss of content.  You keep running into the same basic ideas over and over, until it becomes possible to predict the next sentence before it actually comes.  After a while, Mao starts playing in your head like a catchy tune.  Quoth Mao:  We must have the support of the people.  You complete the thought:  Because without the people, we can accomplish nothing.  Perhaps that's the most insidious aspect of the &quot;Quotations&quot;:  it'll turn you into a Maoist whether you want to or not.	2001-04-22

It's hard to go wrong with subject matter like that, and Nasar does indeed manage to produce a page-flipping biography of John Forbes Nash, Jr.  <br />The secondary characters, Nash's mathematical colleagues, are also vividly depicted.  (And a more Pynchon-esque bunch could hardly be imagined--are all mathematicians this weird?)  I count the book's generally plain, journalistic style as a plus.  If Nasar's prose doesn't reach Updikean levels, at least she conveys a lot of hard-to-explain information in a fairly straight-forward manner.  She makes both the man (who's admittedly tough to like) and his ideas quite interesting.  Before this book, I knew next to nothing about economics or game theory, but Nasar's biography has led me to read more about the subject.	2001-03-24

The teens--a jaded rich girl; her two male friends; and the &quot;fourth angel&quot; who joins them, a young man recovering from his mother's death--turn to drugs and a little bit of the old ultraviolence to block out the pain of their lives.  <br />As an examination of troubled youth, this novel sometimes plunges into the kind of cliches I associate with bad JD movies (emotionally wounded kids rebelling against hypocritical society, etc., etc.).  But Rechy manages to create four vivid, distinct characters here; they're more complex than the street-corner nihilists they proclaim themselves to be--and that's exactly the point.  Tight prose and a quick pace are additional assets.  Though not as impressive as &quot;City of Night,&quot; it's a readable book that hasn't dated much (except for the occasional &quot;far out!&quot; dialogue) since its initial publication in 1972, whereas Bret Easton Ellis' vaguely similar &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; feels lost in the '80s.  It's worth reading.	2001-03-21

It may well have delayed my recovery. The plot: Some kind of ageless evil is menacing a rural town, manifesting itself in the form of rampaging reanimated fetuses (no joke, people). After all kinds of grisly, mysterious happenings (taking up more than half of the novel) a stereotypical wild-eyed preacher, leading a small band of determined locals, shows up with a plan to save the day. Now, it should be noted that horror novels, if they are to be bothered with at all, ought to have at minimum as much merit as your average slasher movie--but it seems to me that I wasted both less money and less time watching &quot;Scream,&quot; which at least scored a few points for decent satire. &quot;The Revelation,&quot; conversely, is so witless, blandly written, and unimaginative (just for fun, count how many chapters end with sentences like &quot;The last thing he heard before he blacked out...&quot;) that I can only assume that it must have been a lousy year in horror fiction for this to have won--as the front cover boasts--the Bram Stoker Award. It's also gratuitously violent; one tasteless scene involving a kitten nearly inspired me to toss the book right out the nearest window. The characters are thoroughly uninteresting; they're either cardboard cutouts (the aforementioned preacher) or so vaguely sketched that it's difficult to get a handle on them. There's no revelation here worth talking about--though it convinced me that trash fiction is no better than trash cinema.	2001-02-28

(Midnight Classics)	Books	3	4	10	N	N	Yeah, but sometimes they just put 'em out to pasture	Let's face it:  Somebody had to write a novel about those Depression-era marathon dance contests, and I suppose Horace McCoy somewhat overrated &quot;classic&quot; is a passable stab at it.  It's tight, it's readable, and--quite apart from its artistic value--it successfully captures a tiny segment of cultural history.  You'll learn a lot about this bizarre episode in American history, much as Charles Willeford's &quot;Cockfighter&quot; teaches readers more than they ever thought they wanted to know about the art of training roosters to kill each other.  <br />I wish, though, that McCoy hadn't given away the ending on the first page, thereby defusing much of the suspense.  Yes, I understand the concept of foreshadowing, but here it just doesn't work.  (In fact, the whole framing device of the novel might have been eliminated entirely, if you ask me.)  In addition, the finale left a bad aftertaste.  You'd have to be a bigger cynic than I am--and, more to the point, a bigger cynic than the narrator is portrayed as being--to be convinced by the climax; it just doesn't seem true to the character.  And as a result, the novel ends not with a bang but with a dull thud. <br />Ka-thump. <br />An OK read, but I probably won't bother with other titles in the Horace McCoy catalog.	2001-02-16

Styron's book is better written than almost any other autobiographical account on the subject you're likely to find, and I strongly disagree with all the complaints that the book is (1) self-serving, (2) stilted, or (3) shallow.  Stryon is hardly the first to point out that writers are far more likely than Joe Average to contract severe depression, that some of the very greatest authors have suffered from this disease; and in doing so here I doubt that he's trying to impress the Nobel Committee.  <br />Nor can I fault him for failing to explain conclusively what triggered his malady.  I've gone through one major depressive episode, which I have explained to myself a hundred different ways without settling on a hard-and-fast answer.  Styron does as well as one could reasonably expect.  He's lucid, articulate, and occasionally (I'm thinking of his episode with Art Therapy) funny.  At under 100 pages, &quot;Darkness Visible&quot; has plenty to offer for what little time it demands from readers.	2001-01-31

Professor Aldridge has admittedly taken on some easy targets in this, a no-nonsense demolition of trendy &quot;minimalist&quot; writers and their ilk.  Much of what he says about, for example, Bret Easton Ellis' terrible (and aptly titled) &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; is somewhat less than profound.  But even so, I happen to find merit in the &quot;cranky old man&quot; school of literary criticism (chaired by Harold Bloom); it's important to have critics like Aldridge, who have a strong sense of the history of literature, who refuse to go along with the wave of mindless enthusiasm that accompanies whatever flavor-of-the-month the mass media hoists upon the rest of us.<br />I take issue with some of Aldridge's arguments here.  Judging from his complaints about the &quot;hermetically sealed&quot; nature of much contemporary literature, it sounds like he belongs to the fiction-as-sociology school of thought.  Personally, I do not believe that literature need be a commentary on society, and in fact more than a few &quot;classic&quot; writers have gone their merry way without fretting much about the social and/or political relevance of their books.  (I also had a few problems with Aldridge's rather undistinguished prose, and found myself marvelling at all the sentences that ramble on and on without benefit of commas.)  But his larger point is quite correct:  that these writers seem out of touch with the society they seek to describe.  His complaints about the cloistered creative writing industry--which, as Aldridge puts it, regularly produces scribes who seem not to have read any books they haven't written themselves--are essentially right on target.  It is also worth pointing out that this refreshingly non-technical book can be easily approached by general readers unfamiliar with academic theory.	2001-01-07

Despite some pointed criticisms of Communism--the author is far from being a &quot;fellow traveler&quot;--this is definitely second-tier Simon; it lacks the scale of his earlier masterpieces and the prose is less fluid (though here I may simply be missing the able hand of long-time Simon translator Richard Howard).  The subject matter is also unfortunate; the novel already feels a little dated, and that certainly cannot be said for &quot;The Wind,&quot; which made Simon's reputation back in the late '50s and stands as one of the best French novels of the past fifty years.  I can recommend &quot;The Invitation&quot; only to interested readers who may want to try out Claude Simon without plunging into his longer (and better) books--this novel is, at least, too short to overstay its welcome.	2001-01-02

Anyone who found themselves gazing blankly at the pages of Robbe-Grillet's &quot;Jealousy&quot; will at least get a general idea of the New Novel from this book.  <br />As yet another literary technique based on the idea that we mere mortals cannot know anything for certain, the New Novel restricts itself to elaborate physical description (usually visual), disregards characterization in the traditional sense, and ignores symbolism altogether (because objects MEAN nothing, they just ARE).  It also plays havoc with the linear time-schemes of conventional novels; if you're familiar with the jumping-back-and-forth plot of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (or if you've seen the notorious art-house film &quot;Last Year at Marienbad,&quot; which Robbe-Grillet wrote) then you're already aware of one of the New Novel's most distinguishing features.  In sum, it tends to be deeply ambiguous and not a little confusing.<br />Luckily for Robbe-Grillet, he's honest enough not to set himself up as a dogmatic theoretician.  The definition of the New Novel, he claims, must be open-ended; the theory must interpret the fiction, not the other way around.  Fair enough, I'd say.  I  think he's correct in claiming that novelists today can no longer write like the naturalists of the 19th Century; but I also doubt--as he optimistically says at one point--that we'll ever come to view the techniques of the New Novel as a &quot;normal&quot; form of fiction, against which other novels will be compared.  The New Novel is just too WEIRD and, unlike, say, the novels of Flaubert, it is difficult to approach it unless you're already familiar with the theories and philosophical ideas it operates under.  But then, theories of literature must always take a back seat to literature itself, which is why the curious reader might be better off tackling Robbe-Grillet's fiction first.  <br />&quot;For a New Novel&quot; can be safely ignored by the general reader, but it's worth a look for fans of the French avant-garde.	2000-12-31

Freud argues that psychoanalysts, though they certainly need extensive training of some kind before they hang up a shingle, shouldn't be required to go through the med school route, which he finds largely irrelevant to the field of psychology.  Subtitled &quot;Conversations with an Impartial Person,&quot; this book is set up as a dialogue between Freud and a not quite convinced but sympathetic listener; as a literary device, it functions pretty well.<br />The whole &quot;lay analysis&quot; angle, which members of the general public (like me) could hardly be expected to find terribly compelling, makes up only part of the book.  The chief interest here, I think, lies in Freud's lucid description of how psychoanalysis is conducted (whereas most of his other books provide only brief glimpses of what happens on Freud's couch).  It also sums up some key Freudian concepts for those who came in late.  All in all, it's readable and informative.	2000-12-27

Jung basically argues for the importance of the individual as opposed to the mob, the latter taking the form of totalitarianism.  Despite many references to the Iron Curtain (this book first appeared in the 1950's), it is not really &quot;dated,&quot; unless you want to argue that contemporary society has since become immune to the dangers of mindless group-think.  Jung's point here has nothing specifically to do with Communism. <br />Still, I found some of Jung's thought tediously familiar.  Let's face it, practically every intellectual from Rousseau to the Unabomber has believed that their contemporaries had somehow lost touch with their true nature, and has had their own ideas about reuniting us all with our Inner Whatever-you-call-it.  In its general outline, &quot;The Undiscovered Self&quot; does not exactly represent an advance in human thought--at least not in my view.  But Jung does have some compelling insights, particularly his notion (which I cannot help but think is the absolute truth) that human conflicts essentially boil down to the tendency to project our own weaknesses (our &quot;shadow side&quot;) onto others.  It will, if nothing else, give you something to think about.  <br />Also, this book (in the R.F.C. Hull translation) taught me my favorite word of the day:  &quot;chiliastic.&quot;	2000-12-12

Not many poets can say so much with so little (from the title poem): &quot;You are the last/Who will know him/Nurse//Not know him,/He is an old man,/A patient,/How could one know him?//You are the last/Who will see him/Or touch him,/Nurse.&quot; If you're like me and have had your share of &quot;chatty&quot; or self-consciously clever wordsmiths, this is strong stuff. (As he writes elsewhere: &quot;I have not and never did have any motive of poetry/But to achieve clarity.&quot;) Oppen's chilly, Spartan poetry sounds like it should be chiseled in stone, and he can be winning even when he departs from form, as proven by the prose sections in &quot;Route.&quot; It's intense, haunting, and truly memorable (and I mean this last adjective literally: I can remember this stuff after I've put the book down, whereas most poetry disintegrates in my head almost instantly). This is the real thing, people, and you owe it to yourself to find a copy.	2000-12-06

Actually, that's just a jumping-off point for a poem more concerned with philosophical issues than the here and now, which is fairly uncommon in this age of tinny free verse poems about pretty much nothing.  Ammons' imagination takes him all over the map, from musings on the trials of being sixty-three years old with &quot;an unaccomplished mission unaccomplished,&quot; to the possibility of personal immortality.  Parts are a little obscure, but on the whole this is very readable, even funny at times.  Ammons knows how to make philosophy entertaining; as he puts it, &quot;Argument is like dining:/mess with a nice dinner long enough, it's garbage.&quot;	2000-11-27

Mr. Thomas' pet theory, which he repeats approximately every other page, is that New Agey &quot;interdependence of nature&quot; business you've heard many times before; we earthly organisms may indeed belong to a seamless web of Nature, but I did not need to have that argument drilled into my head so insistently.  Luckily, Thomas has a clean, concise prose style (though here and there riddled with dense patches of scientific lingo) that at least keeps the pages turning.  He is genuinely informative, and able to link apparently esoteric advances in biology to the everyday lives of the two-legged microbe carriers vulgarly known as human beings.  Readers will either be comforted or irritated by the author's sunny belief in Progress--despite myself, my reaction was closer to the former than the latter.	2000-11-16

The majority of the entries here are brief, fanciful prose-poems in the spirit of Charles Simic's &quot;The World Doesn't End&quot;; if you like one, you'll probably like the other.  Poems like &quot;'Max is a Lunatic' (Everyone)&quot; goof on his own eccentric personality; others are surprisingly direct--and, among the French surrealists, pretty uncommon--expressions of religious belief (&quot;Ballad of the Perpetual Miracle&quot;).

For that reason alone, it's worth reading. I find it interesting to view history through the eyes of ordinary people, and I'm certainly not poorer for having become acquainted with Martha. But I only wish I could be as enthusastic about this book as are its many admirers. What are the problems here? For one, Ulrich's prose is your standard-issue academic fare--competent but pedestrian. For another, Ulrich perhaps makes too many lofty claims for Martha Ballard's sketchy diary; she tries too hard to convince us that we are indeed dealing with an Important Subject. Ulrich is often convincing as she ties in the musings of the diary with the daily happenings of New England society, but in places it sounds like modern times simply would not have come to pass without elderly Martha Ballard of Hallowell, Maine. One also gets the distinct feeling that the author is determined to view her subject through trendy feminist ideology. Martha's male neighbors and acquaintances are usually portrayed as obnoxious twits, resistant to the humble, earthy wisdom that Martha Ballard personifies. Ulrich is just too obviously on her heroine's side. While discussing the extravagant titles often held by prominent males in the region, Ulrich unloads this priceless complaint: &quot;There were no Committees to Inspect the Kitchens and Gardens of Hallowell, no Packers of Candles or Cullers of Linen Thread, nor was there a Sealer of Reels and Sleighs.&quot; Do we need this kind of commentary? This book probably took all kinds of scholarly detective work to pull off; I'm impressed at how much relevant detail the author managed to pick out of Martha's extremely terse diary (portions of which are included at the beginning of each chapter). I give Ulrich an &quot;A&quot; for effort and a &quot;B-&quot; for execution.	2000-10-17

The weakest poems are the ones that come off as relatively straightforward protest pieces (one section is titled &quot;The Vietnam War&quot;), but at least they're not as bad as the stupid titles might suggest. (I tend to quake in fear when I encounter poems called &quot;Listening to President Kennedy Lie about the Cuban Invasion&quot;.) Elsewhere, Bly indulges freely, and with sporadic success, in the kind of imagistic, semi-surreal verse that characterizes much contemporary poetry. It's not bad; Bly, despite his overuse of &quot;there is/are&quot; constructions, comes up with some nice lines now and then. But only ardent fans of 60's-style anti-war poetry really need this stuff.	2000-10-07

That's too bad, really, because &quot;City of Night&quot; turns out to be miles better than most of the laborious Great American Novels that sprang up like so many red, white, and blue weeds during the 50's and 60's. As a look at an important subculture, this novel is amazingly comprehensive, with many memorable character portraits, and feels entirely authentic. Better yet, Rechy manages to imbue the nameless protagonist's trials with real emotional gravity, up to and very much including the pensive, haunting conclusion. The prose manages to be rich and florid without seeming overwrought; it reads very well. I could be snippy and blast Rechy for some forced attempts at Meaning late in the proceedings, but these feel like minor flaws compared to the sweep of the novel as a whole. It is, at very least, a minor classic.	2000-09-17

Given the undeniable intensity of &quot;Blasted,&quot; not to mention the in-your-face subject matter, it's not difficult to see why. I think Kane had at least some talent, but the modest technical skill she brings to this play is definitely overwhelmed by the unpleasantness of the material. Really, &quot;Blasted&quot; is just that old Theatre of the Absurd shtick--you know: &quot;The world is a crazy, horrible place but it's all we have&quot;--updated for somewhat more permissive 1990's audiences; no one familiar with the best plays of Beckett, Pinter, or Stoppard should be terribly impressed by it. The companion piece, &quot;Phaedra's Love,&quot; is more of the same, only lacking the questionable merits of the first play. In fact, &quot;Phaedra's Love&quot; is flat-out awful, strongly suggesting that Kane had really very little to say. But that's often how it goes with would-be rebels in the arts.	2000-09-13

A delicate and enigmatic tale of a young widow and her relationship with a  restless, cosmopolitan fellow, this novel makes no innovations in the art  of fiction, but it is notable for its psychological acuteness; the author  is very good at describing his characters' internal conflicts.  Some  readers will have trouble putting up with the baroque flourishes (this is  one of those 19th Century novels where the characters rarely talk like  human beings), but I quite enjoyed it.	2000-09-10

Beginning with the  youthful Freud's days with pioneer Josef Breuer in late 19th Century  Vienna, it charts the burgeoning movement through the psychoanalysis  organization that Freud founded in 1908--and which nearly went to pieces a  few years later due to some nasty internecine battles.  These were  obviously trying times for Freud, and the book sometimes lapses into an  acrimonious tone (he calls one detractor an &quot;evil genius&quot;); he  also shoots a few poisoned arrows at former colleagues Jung and Adler.  For  the most part, though, it's a very readable, revealing look back at the  days when psychoanalysis was young and had far more enemies than allies:   &quot;Occasionally a colleague would make some reference to me in one of  his publications; it would be very short and not at all flattering--words  such as 'eccentric', 'extreme', or 'very peculiar' would be used.&quot;	2000-09-10

By way of illustrating my point, I will now quote one of the shorter sentences from &quot;The Wind&quot; (tr. Richard Howard): &quot;I remember how the wind blew almost continuously for three months, so that when it did stop (a few hours or a few days--but never more than two or three) you thought you could still hear it, wild and wailing, not outdoors but somehow inside your own head: voices emptied of meaning, nothing but noise and, so it seemed, dust--the dust that penetrated everywhere, insinuated itself under your burning eyelids, in your mouth, communicating its taste to the things you ate, interposing between the skin of your fingertips and what they took hold of (papers left on the desk the day before, plates, napkins) that haunting, imperceptible, granular film.&quot; Still with me? &quot;The Wind&quot; is a lovely 254 page prose-poem, a long, sad sigh of a book. There is a story here--it deals with the pitful, tragic life of one Antoine Montes--but narrative is secondary to Simon's lyrical stream-of-consciousness prose, which at its best achieves an elemental beauty you seldom find in fiction. The appeal of this book is sensuous, not intellectual; you need not even have to follow the serpentine storyline to appreciate this novel. Parts of it can be frustratingly mystifying, but it isn't terribly difficult to read once you have become accustomed to Simon's lush prose. It really is a beautiful book. For those who keep track of these things, Claude Simon won the 1985 Nobel Prize in Literature.	2000-08-30

The  agreeably brief &quot;On Dreams,&quot; while far from a comprehensive look  at the subject, is a good crash-course on this fascinating topic, still  worth reading generations after its initial publication.  <br />Here, Freud  convincingly demolishes the long-standing scientific argument, which is  still very much with us, that considers dreams as simply random mental  events.  He distinguishes between the manifest content of a dream (what  happens) and its latent content (what it means).  He also makes valuable  distinctions among the different types of dreams, varying from the simple  wish-fulfillment dreams mostly restricted to children and the bafflingly  weird ones that we all get on occasion, and takes a stab at explaining why  and how they are formed in our sleeping minds.  You can love Freud or hate  him, but you cannot imagine the 20th Century without him, and he still  deserves our attention.	2000-08-27

As a record of a man's journey  from a kind of living death, this book benefits a lot from Appelfeld's  terse, simple prose, which keeps the tale rolling at a brisk pace.  He's  the sort of writer who knows exactly what he can state explicitly and what  he can leave unsaid.  It may just be me, but I was not altogether convinced  by the book, partly due to the somewhat abrupt ending.  I will tentatively  suggest that the author was only partly successful in dramatizing Bartfuss'  internal conflicts... or maybe I'm just missing the point of Appelfeld's  minimalist artistry.  I will still recommend the book, and suggest that who  anyone likes it should also seek out Appelfeld's &quot;Badenheim  1939.&quot;	2000-06-03

Man, as we're told somewhere along the way, appeared on  Earth during the Holocene (present) era, quite late in the history of our  tiny planet; the book is haunted with a sense of the infinite smallness and  frality of the human race before the utterly impersonal will of nature.   Personally, I could have done without all the scientific talk (much of the  text is composed of geology articles that the narrator cuts out of various  books), but it's still a fairly compelling read.	2000-06-01

It wasn't quite  as innovative as a lot of people have claimed, though.  It strongly  resembles &quot;Hunger&quot; by Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun (one of  Miller's favorite writers and an acknowledged influence on his work), with  the difference, of course, that Miller makes absolutely no concessions to  public decorum.<br />Miller doesn't have the remarkable ability to describe  psychological states that distinguished early Hamsun, or his nicely limpid  style.  Instead, he's fond of unleashing lots and lots of baroque  philosophical bombast upon the page, which sometimes gets tiresome.  &quot;To fathom the new reality it is first necessary to dismantle the  drains, to lay open the gangrened ducts which compose the genito-urinary  system that supplies the excreta of art.&quot;  Uh, whatever you say,  Henry....  Largely due to outpourings like this, the protagonist remains a  somewhat shadowy figure.  We hear much about his homegrown philosophy--not  to mention his escapades with prostitutes--but you wouldn't be able to  recognize him on the street.  Never has anyone said so much about himself  while revealing so little.<br />It may be that I simply became used to  Miller's flamboyant prose, but this book seems to get better as it goes on.  Certain parts have a raw beauty; Miller very convincingly portrays what it  means to live without hope but also without despair.  As a paean to Life,  it is both maddening and touching.  Perhaps Miller, fond of the  warts-and-all approach, wanted it that way.  And if he is right when he  claims, late in the novel, that a book with only one great page is still  worth reading, then there's certainly enough here to make the trip  worthwhile.	2000-05-25

This volume--not quite 600 pages of encyclopedia-style entries of 20th Century authors--struck me as a usefully  coherent overview of modern letters, as presented by someone who seems to  have absorbed the whole of literature.  Like fellow critic Harold Bloom,  Martin Seymour-Smith has apparently read everything.  <br />The book's most  appealing quality is also its biggest weakness:  Seymour-Smith is an almost  unbelievably biased critic.  Listen to him on Sinclair Lewis:  &quot;Lewis  is only of socio-anthropological interest; as a writer, he is almost  worthless.&quot;  Or John Barth:  &quot;ingenious, clever, admirable--and a  crushing bore.&quot;  Or Yukio Mishima:  &quot;evil and cruel... no more  than a nasty little boy.&quot;  He spends far too much time examining the  personalities of the authors, and he pretends to know more about them than,  I think, he has a right to believe; the Mishima quote above is all too  typical.<br />He is also capable of highly eccentric critical judgments.   Very, very few critics have ever judged Wyndham Lewis as &quot;without  question the greatest English-language writer of the century.&quot;  He  takes a surprisingly dim view of many writers commonly considered among the  preeminent of the century--Eliot, Yeats, Mann, Nabokov, Hemingway, Shaw.   (To be fair, though, he's very often dead on the money, championing  oft-overlooked authors like Francois Mauriac, Robert Walser, Robert Musil,  others.)  His prose style is often needlessly convoluted.  He's terribly  fond of cramming long parenthetical asides into the middle of  sentences.<br />Nonetheless, one has to respect Seymour-Smith's positions,  even if they're sometimes difficult to agree with.  The book is, above all,  a valuable reference guide for &quot;serious&quot; readers looking for  suggestions about what to read next.  (I have myself discovered more than a  few obscure but worthwhile authors from this volume.)  If you read it in  this light, and not as the gospel truth, then you'll likely get a lot out  of it.	2000-05-24

The conceit here is that time's arrow runs backwards; the novel begins with the death of its protagonist and goes on,  in reverse, from there.  This is not an original idea, nor, by the way, was  Kurt Vonnegut the first guy to come up with it; C.H. Sisson used much the  same gimmick in his novel &quot;Christopher Homme&quot; back in the '60s.  <br />Amis just doesn't have the skill to deal with the concept adequately.   His characters conduct conversations backwards--but the actual sentences  they speak run forward.  This is perhaps a necessary compromise--no one  would want to read backwards prose--but one wishes that Amis had resolved  this problem without violating his premise.  A more grievous fault lies in  the awkward use of the first-person narrator, which is, I think, another  technical compromise.  Obviously, this book could not have been written in  the first person from the viewpoint of Tod T. Friendly, but Amis' solution  to this is unsatisfactory.  He introduces a nameless second character's  mind, somehow trapped within the body of Mr. Friendly (this is never  clearly explained), which reflects, in comically befuddled fashion, upon  the various happenings.  It feels terribly contrived.  <br />Amis is taking on  a large subject here, but the end result feels too gimmicky--and it is  fatuous to claim that he says anything particularly profound about the  Holocaust.  Despite everything, though, this is a very readable book, with  some funny, memorable moments.  For all its faults, it is not easily  forgotten.	2000-05-21

It is more difficult, though, not to agree with him when he  insists that the vast majority of art produced today is essentially  worthless.  (The title is slightly misleading:  his focus is on fiction,  but he discusses contemporary theatre, poetry, and music as well.)  Those  of us who have trouble thinking of guys like John Updike, John Barth, and  Thomas Pynchon as &quot;major&quot; authors will find a friend in Gardner,  who is not one to mince words.<br />Fortunately, Gardner is aware that the  world of art cannot be reduced to black-and-white contrasts; for all his  self-righteous fire, it is obvious that he has considered his position  well.  Clearly, he knows a lot about the history of art.<br />His argument  here is, I think, largely sound--but I am personally not certain whether we  would be better off if we had an army of young writers eager to affirm all  that is Good, True, and Beautiful.  Bad art is nothing new--the late Roman  Empire was rife with would-be Homers.  The existence of bad art has less to  do with our hopelessly decadent times than with the inherent difficulty  involved in creating timeless masterpieces, as well as the perennial  scarcity of real talent.  And one really does not have to be a  &quot;moral&quot; critic to find fault with authors like William Gass.  Gardner certainly has some valid points here, and this book is definitely  worth reading, but as a call to arms I wonder how much value it really has.  But perhaps you should read this book and judge for yourself.	2000-05-21

Thank you, Bret Easton Ellis.  You've really opened my eyes.<br />The absurdly caricatured portrayal of Los Angeles, which  is of course passed off as gritty realism, is just one problem among many.   This novel makes its point early on and then has nowhere to go, leaving the  reader with vast patches of droning, mediocre prose to slog through.  Ellis  likes those run-on sentences; perhaps this makes sense considering the  narrator's drug problems and general anomie, but to argue that certainly  doesn't make the book any more interesting.  <br />Eventually the purveyors of  &quot;transgressive&quot; literature and suchlike will figure out that  nihilistic, emotionally benumbed characters are--almost by  definition--pretty dull company, at least in fiction.  It's certainly true  here; and, no, making the narrator break down into a crying fit on occasion  doesn't add much emotional texture to the novel.  This book makes Jay  McInerney's &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; (which shares much in  common with the present tome) seem like Dostoevsky.	2000-05-11

Written entirely without punctuation,  and sometimes a little obscure as to exactly what is going on, this book  does not make for easy reading.  It's worth the effort, though.<br />I almost  didn't get through it myself.  &quot;Post-modern hocus-pocus,&quot; I  thought sourly, as I read the first third.  But it becomes oddly  compelling, even poetic.  Beckett's severely minimalistic style is  fascinating; there's nothing in this book except the eerily dehumanized  voice of its narrator, a lonely monologue that generates real poignancy.  The effect is like hearing a voice from beyond the grave, and it haunts the  mind like few conventionally written novels do.	2000-05-11

But he really drops the ball here. This book reads like an unrevised first draft. The diamond-hard sentences of &quot;White Noise&quot; have now given way to flaccid stream-of-consciousness mumbling. The plot is similarly unfocused; I kept expecting all these threads to tie together more neatly, but they never do. And the flimsy scenario DeLillo has contrived here can hardly support all these grandiose meditations on contemporary society, which seem forced into the texture of the novel. One soon tires of lengthy scenes in which the characters dilate endlessly upon the social importance of the evening news, while saying things like &quot;I have my own cosmology of pain.&quot; Give DeLillo credit: he has important things to say. The problem is that he's said everything here more memorably in previous books.	2000-04-30

It has been noted many times that artists are usually not the most pleasant human beings to be around; Maugham's novel is, among other things, a compelling examination of why this is so.  The obsessed artist who dominates this book, Charles Strickland (based on the notorious Paul  Gauguin), walks away from his cushy middle-class existence in England to  pursue his dream to paint, amid frightful poverty, in France.  Strickland  is an unforgettable character, an inarticulate, brutishly sensual creature,  callously indifferent to his fellow man and even his own health, who lives  only to record his private visions on canvas.<br />It would be a mistake to  read this novel as an inspiring tale of the triumph of the spirit.   Strickland is an appalling human being--but the world itself, Maugham seems  to say, is a cruel, forbidding place.  The author toys with the (strongly  Nietzschean) idea that men like Charles Strickland may somehow be closer to  the mad pulse of life, and cannot therefore be dismissed as mere egotists.   The moralists among us, the book suggests, are simply shrinking violets if  not outright hypocrites.  It is not a very cheery conception of humanity  (and arguably not an accurate one), but the questions Maugham raises are  fascinating.  Aside from that, he's a wonderful storyteller.  This book is  a real page turner.	2000-04-29

Frank's goal in life is to win the Cockfighter of the Year  award, and he's taken a vow not to speak another word until he does so.  In  relating silent Frank's journey, the author takes us on a memorable trip  through the cockfighting pits of the Southern U.S. and allows us a close-up  look at the rugged, obsessive, fiercely individualistic types who haunt  them.  You will learn from this novel virtually everything you could  conceivably wish to know about cockfighting; the details feel absolutely  authentic.  Above all, though, it's a convincing portrait of a man driven  half-mad by his private demons.	2000-04-28

It is remarkable that someone born into  slavery could learn to write as well as virtually any &quot;man of  letters&quot; in his era.  Despite Douglass' unhappy lot (or maybe because  of it), he managed to acquire a great deal of insight into the people,  white and black, around him.  Douglass convincingly depicts how the  institution of slavery damages both oppressed and oppressor--it dehumanizes  the former and brings out the cruelest qualities of the latter.  (A hundred  years later, Martin Luther King would say much the same about the practice  of segregration.)  There is much anger in the Narrative--but also a wise  and noble spirit.  Compulsively readable, this book is still very much  &quot;relevant&quot; today, and I can hardly imagine a time in which people  will no longer wish to read it.	2000-04-25

I'm not certain what to make of it, really.  The book is composed of a series of brief vignettes, ranging from exactly one sentence to several  pages, which essentially act as snapshots of various incidents in Cuban  history.  It takes in every era of &quot;that long, sad, unfortunate  island&quot; and includes along the way an awful lot of tyranny, warfare,  and bloodshed, which the author seems to think constitutes the spine of his  native land's history.<br />All of this may not sound like your idea of fun,  and I'll admit that the book sometimes lapses into a monotonous litany of  executions and similar nastiness.  But G. Cabrera Infante is a genuinely  funny guy, who can put more pitch-black humor in one page than an Evelyn  Waugh can pack into fifty.  Some of the episodes here are little  masterpieces of concision.  The author puts forth his rancorous vision with  impressive skill, which makes this book worth reading.	2000-04-25

He's neither too obscure nor too obvious, and if his example were more widely followed then contemporary poetry might find a sizable audience.  The poem &quot;The Continuous Life&quot; says everything that needs saying  about the joys, hopes, fears, tensions, and emptiness of middle-class  existence--or perhaps just plain human existence--and note how well the  cascading rhythm matches its theme.  It reminded me of James Salter's novel  &quot;Light Years,&quot; but Strand manages to compress his vision into a  mere 28 lines.  As an observer of the human comedy, he's quite  perceptive.<br />My only major complaint with this volume is the somewhat  repetitive subject matter--there is too much musing about the Nature of  Art, too many descriptions of verdant scenery.  Considering this was his  first volume of original poetry in at least 10 years, we could have  reasonably expected a little more variety.  Or perhaps I'm being churlish.  Don't let me discourage you:  read this book.	2000-04-24
US	49693709	R3MUFM9GC1ZJCX	0679749012	76874151	The Breast	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Readable, but only partly successful.	How's this for a premise:  a university professor one day inexplicably turns into a human breast.  It's a memorably bizarre set-up that launches Roth on all his usual speculations on the nature of human sexuality.  But  Roth is unable to do much with the idea, and the novel simply lurches along  to a tepid conclusion.  Still, this is very readable, like all of Roth's  fiction; it's entertaining enough for a quiet night at home.	2000-04-23
US	49693709	RD5380SB97OYW	0140188282	843633553	Sister Carrie (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	102	105	N	N	Possibly the greatest novel in American literature	Somewhere in the depths of time a critic once labeled playwright Eugene O'Neill a genius with no talent.  It's a description that could just as easily fit Theodore Dreiser, an uneducated, mercurial man who, while still  in his twenties, and with virtually no experience composing fiction,  managed to crank out what I consider one of the greatest novels in American  literature.  Very few authors have ever managed to generate the raw power  that Dreiser does over the 500 or so pages of &quot;Sister Carrie.&quot;   It is amazing how much of the human experience he has put into this book,  how well he understands the hopes, fears, and desires--mysterious and  contradictory as they often are--that drive ordinary people.<br />The  conventional judgment on Dreiser puts him in the naturalistic,  social-realist tradition of Zola and Hardy.  There is much in this; but I  think his real strength lies in depicting character--Carrie, Hurstwood, and  Drouet really come alive in these pages.  His characters possess a depth  and complexity of feeling that one rarely finds in fiction.  Dreiser has a  melancholy, fatalistic sense that the world may be too vast and impersonal  for people to live in it comfortably, and yet his world is vibrantly human  as well.<br />I personally find Carrie a more likable heroine (if you could  call her that) than many readers have.  She is self-absorbed, yes, but also  capable of compassion for others, and she is never intentionally cruel.   Like all of Dreiser's characters she is somewhere between the angels and  the devils.<br />This is by no means a perfect book.  Dreiser's rhetorical  flourishes can become absolutely ridiculous, and so can his habit of  injecting philosophical commentary into the texture of the narrative. But  the total effect of &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is powerful, and more than  compensates for any defects in the novel.	2000-04-21
US	49693709	R2LPW7S0H9OSZK	0393047059	898276764	Vice: New and Selected Poems	Books	1	12	19	N	N	I've read worse poetry, but....	I wish I could say something nice about this collection, which inexplicably won a National Book Award. Most of the poems (particularly the later ones) take the form of what the book jacket calls &quot;dramatic monologues,&quot; in which the poet thinks her way into the minds of various political/pop culture icons (and sometimes just ordinary folk). Unfortunately, Ai lacks the insight to say anything particularly fresh or even interesting about her subjects; poems like &quot;The Paparazzi&quot; and &quot;Hoover, Edgar J.&quot; are painfully trite. The poet's apparent lack of sympathy for her subjects tends to lead her into heavy-handedness. Worse, she has an erratic ear, resulting sometimes in weird clunkers: &quot;come close between my thighs/and let me laugh for you from my second mouth.&quot; The poet is also excessively fond of having her characters describe themselves getting killed, a bizarre motif that pops up ad nauseam. Here we have Leon Trotsky, who continues prattling on even as his head is split open with an axe (&quot;my head fell to one side, hanging only by skin&quot;). Here's James Dean, who gives us the gory details of his car crash: &quot;My head nearly tore from my neck/my bones broke into fragments.&quot; Other poems deal predictably with a host of sociopolitical figures: Nixon, the Kennedys, Joe McCarthy, O.J. Simpson, and so on. Before long, the poems begin sounding remarkably alike. This kind of ripped-from-the-headlines poetry tends to be ephemeral, and I don't think this volume is any exception. Even the very best poems here are no better than competent. The most I can say for this volume is that it makes for fairly breezy reading... but don't expect much.	2000-04-18

A tale of the crazed Lester Ballard and his gradual slide into absolute depravity--necrophilia is just the beginning of it--this is dark, dark  stuff.  It could have been merely a freak show in prose, but fortunately  we're in the hands of a master stylist, who makes this a rich, haunting,  blackly comic experience.  Nor is the violence extraneous to the point, as  McCarthy puts forth the notion that even a Lester Ballard--&quot;a child of  God much like yourself perhaps&quot;--may somehow occupy a vital place in  the human family.  A first-rate novel.	2000-04-17

A loosely connected collection of stories about a drugged-out low-life and his buddies, &quot;Jesus' Son&quot; is not the kind of book I usually read myself to sleep with... but I can't deny that the author is enormously  talented.  The stories seem random and fragmented, but they do manage to  add up to a coherent whole, and this elliptical quality, I think, largely  accounts for the book's power.  Johnson manages to say a lot about the  strange mystery of life in these pages, where comedy and tragedy frequently  collide, lightning can strike anyone at any moment, and even the doomed can  be saved. <br />Even so, the author sometimes strains too hard with his prose,  which can be pretentiously &quot;poetic.&quot;  The stories are also a tad  uneven in quality.  Still, I'd recommend this book to any serious reader of  fiction.	2000-04-16

Ginsberg is perhaps an &quot;important&quot; poet, and I admit that &quot;Howl&quot; has a certain frothy energy.  But aside from the oceanic rhetoric, there's not much in these poems; it's the kind of poetry that no  doubt sounds great when recited before a crowd, but doesn't really bear  much scrutiny.  I was tired of hearing about the best minds of Allen  Ginsberg's generation long before the bombastic, repetitive verses of the  title poem came to a close.  A few of the additional poems included,  though, are decent enough, and manage to communicate a sense of the  transcendent in the stuff of everyday life.	2000-04-16

Robbe-Grillet's method is, in part, to replace  psychological analysis (a hallmark of French literature) with objective  visual description.  His work is often hauntingly ambiguous precisely  because the author refuses to impose, at least overtly, any kind of meaning  on his narrative, or allow us to enter his characters' minds.  He simply  writes scenes--and let the reader make of it what he will.<br />In  &quot;Snapshots,&quot; though, the author generally comes up empty.  I just  don't know what to think of these stories, which present the reader with a  simple sequence of events, elaborately detailed, and then stop.  One can  pick them apart and find more to them than might be immediately clear, but  there isn't much here worth dwelling on.  &quot;The Secret Room&quot; is  probably the best of an undistinguished lot.<br />Perhaps the author needed  to write these little exercises before he could go on to bigger and better  things.  I'd advise the interested reader to skip the stories and go  straight to the novels, in which Robbe-Grillet's peculiar talent displays  itself more fully.	2000-04-16

I tend to think of his books as post-modern detective stories, in which the  mystery to be solved is nothing less than existence itself; that the reader  often finds himself in the dark is very much to the point.  They should be  interesting to anyone looking for an off-the-beaten-path read.<br />&quot;Jealousy&quot; (the better of the two) deals with a love triangle  in a remote African plantation... which may or may not be all in the  narrator's mind.  It's creepy and enigmatic.  &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot;  is a vaguely Kafkaesque tale about a soldier attempting to deliver a  mysterious package in a vast, unnamed city.  Admittedly, Robbe-Grillet is  not the most approachable of authors, but these densely composed novels  amply pay off the attention required to read them.	2000-04-16
