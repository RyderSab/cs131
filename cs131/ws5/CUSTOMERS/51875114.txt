Ria is a young woman from Ireland whose first love, Danny is the man she eventually marries and with whom she raises two children. Years later, she faces the shocking realization that, what she thought was the &quot;perfect&quot; marriage and family, comes to a sudden end by her husband's abrupt departure. In the mean time, Marilyn, who resides in Connecticut, is living day to day doing her best to endure a painful recovery of her own personal loss. One day Marilyn phones Ria's residence and a chance dialogue between them results in arranging for the two women to switch residences for a summer. In doing so, certain events and truths are revealed to one another about the other's life; events and experiences that were the other to know the truth could cause great pain and heartache. They discover that things are not always as they seem, and have seemed. Danny is not the debonaire husband Ria idealized him to be. Rosemary gives the appearance of being the loyal friend and confidante; &quot;appearance&quot; being the definitive word. Gertie is so deep in her denial that her pretending to be happy becomes her saving grace. <br />Ms. Binchey a superb story teller. Her style is that of interwoven dialogue and emotional action/reaction. I found myself completely absorbed in each of these people's lives until the very last page.	2003-04-18

Many relationships fail because an individual makes assumptions and projects their expectations onto the other person. &quot;The Mate Map&quot; holds the individual accountable for what they want and desire in a relationship by presenting a list of attributes one seeks in a relationship. It then gives examples as to how each attribute could or could not be compromised depending on the individual's standards. The individual then rates these attributes on a scale of importance. Through a series of exercises and evaluations, these attributes are then applied to an already existing relationship or one that is in its beginning stages. <br />If you are looking for someone to make you happy and fill a void, this book is not a quick fix. If you are one who takes responsibility for your thoughts, feelings and actions, &quot;The Mate Map&quot; is an excellent guide and resource and can be quite effective towards a successful, fulfilling relationship.	2002-10-22
US	51875114	R1DKEXHM2ZKNV2	059035342X	667539744	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A classic for modern times	Recommended by several adult friends, I finally read \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", the first of the \\"Harry Potter\\" series. I can see why this, and the succeeding three books in the series have remained on the bestseller lists. J.K. Rowling was indeed gifted with a stellar and creative charm and imagination. Harry, Ron and Hermione share a bond likened to that of Oz's beloved Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tinman and Cowardly Lion. And words like \\"Hogworts\\", \\"muggles\\", and \\"quidditch\\" are considered a part of the English language (not to mention the many languages in which the book has been translated and read all over the world).<br />Perhaps, when originally conceived, Ms. Rowling had children in mind when she wrote \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", followed by the subsequent books in the Harry Potter series. But adults will be equally intrigued and absorbed.	2002-09-25
US	51875114	R1P1CE6HMHUVCP	0060185147	737127896	Courting Trouble	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Mediocre and unrealistic	When I read the inside cover synopsis of this book, I was anticipating a good weekend read... until I got past the first three chapters. \\"Mediocre\\" seems to be the definitive word among several of the reviewers. Because from then on, what I thought had potential to be a good page-turning thriller, became just that.<br />While out of town on a holiday weekend get-away, Anne Murphy, an associate in an all-female law firm, comes upon her local newspaper where, upon reading the headlines, learns of her own murder. Obviously, the victim is one of mistaken identity. The rest of the story follows Anne, along with her law firm associates, solving the mystery of her murder.<br />I enjoy reading books featuring strong, female characters overcoming adversities. But in this case, I think perhaps Ms. Scottoline was trying too hard to over emphasize Anne's strength of character. For example, at first, Anne reacts with horror and disbelief -- a normal reaction for anyone in her situation. However, as the story unfolds, she seems to take the whole incident in stride, at times even joking about it. <br />Another thing that makes this story rather contrite and unrealistic is the timeline in which the events unfold. A few months ago, the cast of the popular TV series \\"CSI\\" was on Larry King's show, talking about the show's popularity and success, emphasizing it's authenticity. One of the technical advisors to the show stated that everything about \\"CSI\\" is true to life... except that crimes such as those depicted on the show are not solved in an hour, referring to the show being an hour long. Well, crimes such as the one depicted in \\"Courting Trouble\\" are not solved in three days, let alone with such nonchalance. But then again, this is, after all, only fiction.	2002-09-25

What I like about this book, aside from it's fast-pace and intriguing plot, is that Nina is depicted as an independent woman with smart business savy, yet one with shortcomings and insecurities. In other words, she's human.<br />Having just left her husband and a prestigious corporate law firm in San Francisco, Nina relocates to Lake Tahoe where she sets up a private practice. There, she takes her first criminal case, Misty Patterson, accused of murdering her abusive husband. In the meantime, Nina has her own personal issues to resolve, including a pending divorce, and warding off intimidation from a another defense attorney, drivin by male ego, who's use to having the run of the town's clientele.<br />Other bright and colorful characters include Nina's private investigator friend who has hinted at being more than just colleagues, a sassy and witty secretary who has friends and relatives in high places as well as referrals, and a supportive family with whom she takes temporary residence.<br />If &quot;Motion to Suppress&quot; is an indication of what's to come, I look forward to more of Perri O'Shaughnessy's books.	2002-09-25

Having read and enjoyed \\"Along Came a Spider\\", I felt compelled to read this second book in the Alex Cross series. Had I known of the graphic and gorey details of this book I probably would not have picked it up to begin with. However, I was already hooked after the first page, and every page thereafter. <br />If you are a fan of James Patterson, and can get beyond the gruesome scenes of women being brutally raped and murdered, then you, too, will probably find yourself turning the pages of this book to the very end.	2002-09-03

The book opens with a homeless man, who goes by the name of \\"Mister\\", who barges into a prestigious Washington D.C.law firm. There, he holds members of the firm hostage at gun point for several hours, only to end in his own tragic death via the law enforcement. From that point on, the story drags on, documenting the plight of the homeless. Not until half-way into the book do we get even get a glimpse of \\"Mister\\"'s character and why he chose to terrorize this particular law firm. A chapter or two about the plight of the homeless and poverty in America would have sufficed, followed by another chapter or two as to why the main character, Michael Brock chose to leave all the amenities of a prestigious law firm to help those who were less fortunate (hence, the name \\"The Street Lawyer\\"). <br />John Grisham is one of the best authors of his genre. Don't judge him by this book. For vintage Grisham read \\"A Time to Kill\\", \\"The Firm\\", and \\"The Pelican Brief.\\"	2002-08-30

Thus begins the trial both in and out of the court room. Is the murder of the two assailants of this little girl an act of temporary insanity or justifiable homicide? Therein lies the question that becomes unraveled in this riviting story. <br />Set in Mississippi, the characters include a pompous district attorney who uses this case for his own egotistical and political gain; a sympathetic defense attorney with integrity who puts his client first before his legal fees; a law clerk/student with liberal ideas and notions, wit and smart legal savy; the Ku Klux Klan, members of the black community from around the state, the media and the National Guard. One would think this is a setting out of the civil rights movement of the 60's, with scenes of demonstrations, rioting and killing of innocent people. This story in fact takes place in 1989 (the year the book was published).<br />My only critique is that the book was a bit lengthy at times. But overall, it's worth the read from beginning to end.	2002-08-15

Textually, it was easy reading and, admittedly, I was intrigued from the first page. As the story unfolds, one really sees the true colors... dark, dismal and corrupted colors in this case... of the rich and famous. I actually felt compassion for Jack's loss of his brother, while at the same time enraged and disgusted by his supposed \\"poor little rich girlfriend\\", along with that of her immediate family, the attorney who defended them, and other supposed law enforcers who participated in their sick schemes. <br />The ending left some questions still unanswered as well as some loose ends that seemed to have gotten dropped by the wayside midway through the story. But overall, I would recommend this book if for no other reason, you get some good suspense along with a little romance.	2002-08-05

There were times I found the storyline rather contrite, though it had some poignant, heartfelt moments. Plus the storyline overall had too many similarities to Firefly Beach, from which Safe Harbor was essentially a spin-off. If you want true vintage Luanne Rice, read &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; and &quot;Follow the Stars Home.&quot;	2002-08-05

There are two separate stories. One traces Carlynn's life beginning in 1937 at the age of 7; the other begins with Joelle's birth in 1967.  The two stories merge into one where deep rooted feelings and secrets are revealed between the two women and that of their loved ones.

It is more to do with Chelsea's life's passions, mainly her obsession in finding her birth parents. While on her search she encounters many adversities, including being shunned by a reserved New England community that does not condone her free-spirited lifestyle, including a pregnancy without a father in the picture, a love affair with one of the town's available and handsome men, and a business partnership in the town quarry. <br />As the story unfolds, we learn that Norwich Notch has some hidden secrets and \\"skeletons\\" of their own that they don't want uncovered and disclosed, which include illegitimacy and domestic abuse. In other words, they want to give the appearance that they are a quaint, New England community... \\"appearance\\" being the definitive word. Thus, it is easier for them to hold Chelsea Kane in judgment rather than admit their own shortcomings.<br />I gave the book 4 stars because I thought it was a bit too long. I would have left out the lengthy descriptions of the quarry business. Aside from that, it's one of those books that will grab your attention from the beginning and keeps you hooked right up to the end.	2002-03-05

When I see a book cover showing a semi-clad man and woman in a moment of passion, it gives the implication of a hot, passionate romance from beginning to end. This is indeed a story of romance and passion, but it is also the story of two lonely people, Stone Man and Devon, who have suppressed their respective painful pasts, while co-existing in the adverse elements of a brutal winter in the Yukon, in the late 19th century. As the story evolves we come to know these two people's inner thoughts and desires through how they relate to one another.<br />This a book to be read by the fireside or snuggled in a warm blanket, lest you get chills (literally) while reading Ms. Hannah's vivid descriptions of the Yukon wilderness in winter.	2001-12-10

Landon is conflicted with teen peer pressure as his feelings for Jamie become increasingly endearing with each passing day. <br />&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; could also be entitled &quot;A Gift to Remember&quot;.

She has done an excellent job of historical research... from the vivid, graphic battle scenes at Hastings to the societal culture of the period. The love stories of Ailith &amp; Rolf, and Julitta &amp; Benedict would stand alone regardless of the time period. However, the setting of 11th century Britain makes these &amp; all the characters that much more intriguing.	2001-07-18

Superbly written from the horrific, graphic details of a young girl's painful and humilitating ordeal to the beautiful, natural landscape of the land in which this story takes place. Don't stop after reading this book. The sequels to follow are just as captivating.	2000-11-08

These women forgot one very important rule... DO NOT PLAY GAMES. Men despise games. Yet this whole book  is a 'how to play games' in order to get a man. Men want one simple  thing... to be loved and accepted for who they are. You don't need 'rules'  to tell you what is just common sense.<br />Women... you do not  &quot;need&quot; this book! The sad fact is that many women feel they have  to have a man to make them happy and fulfilled. No one can make you happy  but YOU. If you have self-confidence and inner peace within yourself you  don't 'need' a man to give you these qualities... and you certainly don't  need this book.	2000-07-27

This book has everything in a good romance novel... passion, longing, desire, villans, heroes, life-long vendettas,  revenge. Even though the ending was somewhat predictable, it still held my  interest and curiousity from the very first page.	2000-02-28

Although this book is written in Ms. Riley's unique style of humor and  cynicism, I kept waiting for something to happen. &quot;The Oracle  Glass&quot; was far more captivating; it's Ms. Riley's best, in my opinion.  &quot;Vision of Light&quot; is also a good read.	2000-02-15

Ms. Laker does just that in this beautifully crafted novel. She is an excellent story teller and has a wonderful way of getting inside the human heart and soul through her  characters.
