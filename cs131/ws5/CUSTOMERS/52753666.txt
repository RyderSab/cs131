I had to come out of retirement to say this book is wacked. I am going to say that Mr. Coleman is a very creative writer, however, I wished I never purchased this book.   <br /> <br />It is just about a bunch of DOG's.  Maybe next time Mr. Coleman, even though it holds truth, don't care to read about it in this way.  How dare two sister - that's what really pissed me off!!!!!  And Corey needs a damn doctor seriously. The other two are just helpless.  All them are unworthy.	2005-05-06

Shay and Ric what a love battlefield.  I enjoyed this book of fiction as it is.  Some people really do fall for the drama that a mate will dish to them.<br />Shay, Wood and Ric were all in the same boat confused, they had issues. I must say this book was very entertaining it had it's flaws, but sometime what we think is love isn't and sometime we settle for less and do what we have to do. Shay was living through her romance writing and got stuck in the middle of it with Ric. Shay didn't know reality was until it hit her square in the face.  Ric, on the other hand was doing what he knew was best for him.  Woody, what can I say about him, just that I liked him.  I didn't truly agree with his actions, however, he got what he wanted. It's always a great day to wake up and see reality for what it is for.	2001-08-23

Why did Jada agree to do the do with Wellington and you know who?  The book has it moments, however, I guess the sequel will piece it all together. This book is full of sex.  This one was very confusing especially about a church woman with worldly ways.  Will those who write about christian women identify them from church women because there is a difference.  We all are not perfect but lets not be confusing.  There are other parts in the book that did help it out once you got beyond all the sex drama.	2001-08-15

It dealt with feelings, health, love, relationship and romance on a whole different level.  We sometime forget as readers that everyone is doing just fine and in the end it will work out alright.  It isn't true for everyone.  People are out there living in life of turmoil, but there is hope. This book explores all the above avenues.  Keep on writing Ms. Jackson, I love to know what else is out there for real people living in real situations.	1998-04-27

I am a female and I have enjoyed many of my female writers, however, you have been put on top of the list over them.  I enjoyed &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot; and then I've just finished reading this one &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;.  Dickey, I enjoy knowing when characters fall in and out of love with respect and understanding. Sometimes we know it can turn ugly also. How we truly act with outrages situations.  This book had me laughing my head off like I was enjoying it as a movie.  I enjoy knowing that they can also believe in God, attend church and participate in worthwhile activities/organizations.  Please write a book atleast once or maybe twice a year.  Boy I am enjoying you.  Hurry up with the next book, but don't rush to fast.  Loving you in Chicago!!!  Stay blessed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1998-04-20

I can't wait until the next novel comes out from these writers.  The story lines details excellent real life events, moments, hopes and dreams.   No matter what an individual looks like, their environment, their hopes, dreams or greatest satifications; it can be achieved no matter what obstacle comes into ones life.  I really enjoyed the characters they were real life people, with real problems and solutions that were and are achieveable.   Writers please hurry up and write another one please.
