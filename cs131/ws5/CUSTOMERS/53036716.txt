It is a closely-argued work on behalf of clean and clear communications.  It is also a wonderful art book depicting the evolution of an often-misunderstood art form.  <br />Whether you're an engineer, a statistician, a businessman, or a teacher, this beautifully-designed book will help you become a more effective communicator.	2004-07-10

Tufte has revised and extended his theory of graphical excellence with a handful of simple yet powerful techniques for improving our presentation graphics.  <br />Anyone involved in graphics design or in the communication of complex information should have this book on his shelf---it is simply too valuable to keep having to borrow it from your public library.	2004-07-10

It was naturally only a matter of time before he cast a critical eye on the software most responsible for dumbing down information transfer across the fruited plains---PowerPoint.<br />Don't worry: Tufte's criticisms of the software package are not the latest round of Microsoft-bashing from an academic elite practically wed to its Macs.  <br />Rather, Tufte sets his sights on bigger and more rewarding game: how presenters have watered down their presentation styles to suit off-the-rack presentation templates provided by this software package. <br />His thesis is as simple and elegant as his goal of streamlined, impactful communication.  PowerPoint lacks the resolution necessary to convey a rich stream of information to the presentation audience.  <br />If you're inclined to defend the software, ask yourself if you've endured the following in a PowerPoint slideshow:<br />- An unending stream of bullet lists or &quot;talking points&quot; consisting of a handful of words per slide<br />- Branding (logos, headers, footers, titles etc) which takes up a large portion of available slide real estate<br />- &quot;Sesame Street&quot; style animations which obscure rather than illuminate the subject matter<br />- Distracting audio cues which draw the audience's attention away from the speaker and toward &quot;the machine that goes, 'PING'&quot;<br />Or try a simpler exercise: Think back to the best talk or pitch you can recall.  Was PowerPoint employed?  I suspect not; and for good reason, as Tufte argues.<br />Sadly, thanks to the ubiquity of the software, the abuse of PowerPoint has consequences far beyond bored audiences.  In a particularly powerful section of the essay, Tufte demonstrates how PowerPoint contributed to the space shuttle Columbia disaster.  <br />Since my purchase of this pamphlet, I have shared it widely with my PowerPoint-happy colleagues.  The result, I'm happy to say, has been far more impactful and dynamic presentations which do not shirk on the data.   <br />Once my dog-eared copy circulates widely enough (or enough freeloaders buy their own), my company may well break off the shackles of boring meetings and overly-slick sales pitches once and for all.	2004-07-10

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was an Army officer and war hero of the Soviet Union condemned to spend a large portion of his life laboring away in Stalin's gulags.  Rather than wither away as so many of his fellow prisoners did, Solzhenitsyn's moral outrage sustained him, and he began collecting scraps of stories from the unfortunates condemned alongside him, eventually weaving these pieces into an epic narrative worthy of Tolstoy.<br />I will herein paraphrase one haunting anecdote, one of many which are strewn across each page of this gigantic work.  It is to my mind indicative of the true nature of Communist regimes everywhere.<br />Solzhenitsyn tells us of a Party official who attended one of the endless memorial get-togethers.  Someone mentions the name of Stalin (not present), thus prompting everyone in the audience to \\"spontaneously\\" stand and applaud, for fear of appearing to be less enthusiastic in their support of the dictator than their fellows.<br />The applause goes on and on.  Old men sweat and grow pale as the minutes drag on.  Yet no one dares be the first to stop applauding and sit down, for they will immediately be marked as being less supportive of the regime.  It becomes a tragic comedy---one wonders who will be the first to collapse from sheer exhaustion.  Yet the applause continues in the sweaty, gasping throng.<br />Finally, one brave soul ceases to applaud and sit down, giving the audience implicit permission to do the same.  The relief is palpable as everyone sits and the business of the gathering resumes.<br />This tale was told to Solzhenitsyn by the man who first sat down, who was arrested this very night and thrown in the gulag for this \\"crime.\\"<br />This is the ugly truth of totalitarianism: one must ever appear to be more lunatic in their support for the madmen at the head of the regime to stave off the knock on the door in the middle of the night.<br />Solzhenitsyn's greatest work is rife with these truths, told compelling with a white-hot fire of outrage undimmed by passing decades.	2002-05-26

Stan Lee himself could do little better than these angst-ridden antiheroes:  a racecar driver spared a gruesome death only by having his brain placed in a robot body; a movie actress who could grow to gargantuan heights or shrink to Lilliputian dimensions; a test pilot bonded with a strange alien radiation.  <br />Together, they would tackle the oddest menaces to be found:  a disembodied brain with a gorilla sidekick, an octogenarian madman with world-conquering pretensions, a shape-shifter able to take on any form. Unlike your other super-powered teams of the time, the Doom Patrol did not adjust well to their new situation, and the tension on the team was palpable from the first. <br />Arnold Drake's Doom Patrol was in many ways a precursor to Chris Claremont's X-Men.  His stories were character-driven and emphasized the alienation each of the heroes felt from their comrades as a result of their abilities.  The team struggled on behalf of a world which would never accept them.  And behind it all lurked the unfathomable ambitions of their stricken leader, Dr. Niles Caulder, \\"The Chief.\\"  <br />This collection includes \\"My Greatest Adventure/Doom Patrol\\" 80-89 from 1963-1964.    <br />It is a must-have for any Silver Age comics fan.	2002-05-07

When a multi-disciplined group of experts on the medieval period discover a message requesting help in perfect modern English in ruins dating back to the 14th century, they embark upon a time-travelling adventure melding science fiction with historical literature.  <br />The results are decidedly mixed.   Crichton's twists are often telegraphed and his characters rarely rise above their archetypes.  He displays a solid knowledge of the medieval period and quite ably explains the quantum mysteries in terms accessible to the layman.  The tale itself is straight-ahead adventure of the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; stripe---this is fast-food fiction, not &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; <br />Still and all, Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot; is like a terrific television show---it's fun, entertaining, and mildly informative to boot.	2002-05-07

Historical fiction offers wondrous advantages to the writer---after all, who needs to generate story ideas when the lives of our forbears offers all the triumph and tragedy we need?<br />Pressfield debuted in the genre with the marvelous &quot;Gates of Fire&quot;, his account of Spartan King Leonidas' last stand at Thermopylae.  With &quot;Tides of War&quot;, he returns to ancient Greek history, this time relating the story of Alcibiades, the most accomplished politician, rhetorician, and commander of his day.  <br />Undefeated in battle, Alcibiades dominated the scene during the Pelopponesian War.  He commanded and counseled leaders on both the Athenian and Spartan sides in the conflict, earning considerable enmity and admiration in both camps.  He trucked with the Persians as well, making him almost unique in the annals of history in his ability to play the political chameleon.<br />&quot;Tides of War&quot; is told from the perspective of Polymides, Alcibiades' assassin, and his legal counsel.  Pressfield succeeds wildly in bringing Thucydides' account of the cataclysmic, 27-year long conflict to life.  We recognize these long-dead characters in all their complexity---their loves, hates, and follies.  When Polymides is betrayed by his wife, we sympathize; when he is swayed by the charismatic Alcibiades, we empathize.  Pressfield makes us care about these characters with his brilliant pacing and dialogue.  <br />If you're a student of history or a fan of historical drama, drink deeply from &quot;Tides of War.&quot;	2001-01-22

Even though all salaried employees were trained as Green Belts, even though all managers took great care to spout the proper nostrums at the proper times, nothing really changed much in how we operated.  <br />I worked on a new product program which served more as salve to the egos of engineers than to improve our product for our customer.  I and a few others fought valiantly to ensure that the voice of the customer was injected into the process, and that the design capability was measured and reported through Six Sigma scorecards.  This was all deemed to be unimportant in the rush to get the product to market.  <br />Eckes' book reveals why this was so.  <br />Early on, he had counseled Jack Welch that Six Sigma rests on two pillars: customer satisfaction and process capability.  It's quite simple: ask the customer what he wants and fine tune your process to efficiently deliver it.  Thus you both increase revenue (through customer loyalty and product quality) and decrease costs (by eliminating the hidden factory and focusing only on customer CTQs).  Welch being Welch, he completely ignored the former and focused on the latter, to great effect.  <br />In 1999, Welch realized that this was a mistake, as customer after customer inquired why they didn't notice a change in GE's products and services after the Six Sigma introduction.  While shareholders realized double-digit growth year after year, customers saw the same old mixed bag of products and services.  Welch immediately launched a major initiative to reduce customer span and inject the voice of the customer into GE processes.  <br />Eckes, to his credit, indulges in a bit of well-deserved &quot;I told you so.&quot;  After all, it's not often one proves the most admired CEO in the world to be wrong.  <br />This is an excellent book covering the whys and wherefores of a Six Sigma introduction.  For those of us in the trenches trying to effect lasting change in our companies, this is an indispensable resource.  If you're looking for an in-depth guide to the tools employed in Six Sigma project execution, grab &quot;Implementing Six Sigma&quot; by Forrest Breyfogle instead.	2001-01-20

This is not because most Americans are functionally illiterate (although this is arguably true---use a word over three syllables in a sentence, preferably with a Latin suffix, and watch the jaws slacken).  It is not because King is a sellout, cranking out the literary equivalent of Jujubees.  It is because what interests King interests us, and because he works quite hard to deliver it in digestible form.  <br />&quot;On Writing&quot; is a quite unusual book---equal parts stunning, no-holds-barred autobiography on the order of Rousseau's Confessions and insider's look into the craft of writing novels and short stories.  King has always been pretty fearless in dishing himself up to the public---this is no J.D. Salinger, hiding under the bed and diddling an occasional fan.  But his courage in relaying the good, the bad, and the ugly in his life is simply astounding.  <br />Amateur writers are always seeking out the magical formula to literary success.  This is why books on writing represent one of the hottest markets in publishing today.  As King reveals, there is no magic formula.  You simply employ your God-given talent day after day, no matter how tough it gets or how the market responds, the best you can.  Writing is no easier than sculpting or painting---it is the product of an enormous amount of difficult and demanding labor.   To do it well takes more than the ability to turn a phrase or generate a compelling story idea.  It takes a willingness to go to work, day after day, just like everyone else in the world (okay, except the Kennedy family).  <br />I personally find King's stuff to be a mixed bag.  I've often wondered how someone gifted enough to produce riveting thrillers like &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; or &quot;The Shining&quot; could also crank out such hackneyed crap as &quot;Storm of the Century.&quot;  It turns out the answer is pretty simple---you do the best you can with the story you wish to tell, but some stories are better than others.  <br />A great book for any King fan or any aspiring writer (and aren't we all aspiring writers at some point?)	2001-01-20

Those of us who have cracked the covers on this daunting work have more often than not become utterly entranced with its detailed depiction of the whale trade at its apogee.  One could not help but wonder how Melville, no mean sailor himself, had managed to create a world as deep as the sea which inspired it.  <br />The answer has arrived with Nathaniel Philbrick's &quot;In the Heart of the Sea.&quot;  The Nantucket whaleship Essex and the misfortunes which befell it following its encounter with an enraged sperm whale in the trackless Pacific Ocean inspired Melville's timeless novel.  <br />Whereas &quot;Moby Dick&quot; reaches its climax with the destruction of the Pequod by the great white whale, the suffering of the men of the Essex begins here, stranded thousands of miles from hospitable land with meager provisions in boats suited only for short jaunts.  Their tale of perseverance, survival, and redemption rivals that of the Wedding Guest in Coleridge's &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&quot;  <br />If the recent success of the blockbuster movie &quot;Castaway&quot; has whet your appetite for stories of epic struggle for survival, you will devour &quot;In the Heart of the Sea.&quot;  <br />If, on the other hand, you follow the outgoing President's habit of purchasing books because they look nice on the shelf and impress down-on-their-luck former beauty queens, I should point out that the jacket of this book is quite attractive and may suit your tastes as well.	2001-01-20

I have at best only a mild interest in the ingenious ways which man has developed to inflict pain and suffering on his fellow man.  <br />Jean Kellaway chooses the time-honored Time/Life books approach to her subject---lots of big color pictures, a couple of paragraphs of execrable prose on her subject, and the requisite coda denouncing the practices she recounts with ready glee.  <br />More disturbing to me than the numerous images of broken and burning victims were the numerous errors Kellaway makes in covering the various torture methods employed down through the ages.  She describes the knout employed by Peter the Great's thugs as being a type of flogging.  This is true, but the truly hideous aspect of the application of the knout was that the victim was simultaneously roasted over a fire.  Thus, the wounds inflicted by the knout were exposed to flame, increasing the agony of the victim tenfold.  <br />She relays the old canard about Marie Antoinette's responding to the Paris mob's cries for bread with &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;; this has been discredited far too many times to recall by professional historians not given to producing picture books on torture.  <br />She is curiously soft on the crimes of Communists, a lot well known for their hell-spawned creativity in the art of cruelty.  At one point, she actually justifies the Stalinist gulags (survival rate-10 percent) by pointing out that Stalin himself did time in a czarist camp and that this was the way he chose to industrialize Russia.  Alexander Solzhenitsyn's &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; tells a different story.  <br />In short, this book is a complete travesty and I suspect no one will be stupid enough to purchase it outright.  I intend to send my copy to Dr. Kevorkian; I'm certain the numerous depictions of sadism will adorn his cell marvelously.	2001-01-20

Since 1985, we endure these series at about a one-a-year clip, each more execrable than the last as beloved characters get strip-mined to provide fodder for another gargantuan battle against pure evil to pad the pockets of lazy and unimaginative writers. <br />Karl Kesel's hands aren't clean in this matter either: one of the better writers in DC's stable, Kesel's work on &quot;Hawk &amp; Dove&quot; was always fairly interesting and uncontrived.  Once that series ended, we were socked with &quot;Armageddon: 2001&quot; as Hawk became the ubiquitous uber-tyrant Monarch; then &quot;Armageddon: The Alien Agenda&quot; which was a poor sequel with the other also-ran Captain Atom; which in turn was followed by &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, which featured Hawk/Monarch's transformation into another omnipotent opponent for our trusty heroes, this time called Extant, who promptly murdered the Justice Society for no apparent reason. <br />In between, of course, Hal Jordan, the Silver Age Green Lantern, suddenly went nuts and destroyed the Green Lantern Corps and seemingly half the universe in &quot;Emerald Twilight&quot;.  Jordan turned up as the master villain behind Extant in &quot;Zero Hour.&quot;<br />With &quot;Final Night&quot;, this cycle comes to a merciful close.  The plot is incomprehensible but basically revolves around an old Legion of Super-Heroes villain called the Sun Eater coming to take a bite out of Sol.  The world is saved in the end, of course, and by an unlikely hero.  Unlikely, that is, unless you've followed any of the DC stuff for the last 15 years, that is.  <br />Another pedestrian crossover cynically geared toward making lots of money off gullible fans.  2 stars for Kesel trying to do the right thing, at least.	2001-01-01

I read a lot, and a lot of what I read (particularly that written within the last decade) is simply poorly-written garbage.  The authors lack knowledge of basic grammar and composition.

Worse, they can't even turn a phrase to make the experience a pleasure for the wordsmiths among their readership.  <br />And that's pretty much all there is to say about &quot;Left Behind.&quot;  <br />I've always rather enjoyed apocalyptic fiction, served up straight as in &quot;The Omen&quot; or with a wink as in &quot;Good Omens.&quot;  LaHaye and Jenkins' writing is so weak (I believe LaHaye came up with the concept and Jenkins actually wrote the thing) that I couldn't slog through a hundred pages without throwing the book in the trash for the god awful dialogue, the truck stop proselytizing, the paper-thin characterization and plot.  Unfortunately, I've bought 6 paperbacks, believing that something this popular couldn't possibly be drivel.  Live and learn...<br />An example for those of you who are inclined to think I'm given to hyperbole in describing how wretched this book is:  we all know the story concerns the conflict between God and the Antichrist.

You won't find much in the way of titillation in his tales unless it's the frisson one gets upon seeing an imaginative concept brilliantly executed.  <br />In &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, Clarke gives us a distinctly different sort of alien invasion than the laser-and-bomb battles we're used to from decades of movies and novels.  Clarke's Overlords simply hover above our cities, unapproachable and immune to harm.  When the initial furor dies down, they start to execute their plan.  <br />The tale spans generations and never flags in its ability to grab and hold the reader's attention.

This trend continued with Marvel's Secret Wars soon afterward and is still with us today.  <br />&quot;Crisis&quot; is the high-water mark of the genre.  Unlike most crossover series, Crisis promised lasting changes to the DC universe, and it mostly delivered.  A couple of relatively minor characters were killed off, while a major Silver Age character whose book had recently been cancelled joined them, although his death was sufficiently ambiguous as to almost guarantee his eventual return.  <br />George Perez's work is quite attractive, but Wolfman's writing is overwrought and incomprehensible.  Throughout the 12 issues, we get exactly two well-written scenes: the destruction of Earth-6, and the death of Supergirl.  Everything else is drivel.  <br />Unfortunately, &quot;Crisis&quot; established once and for all that drivel is what the fans want.  Since this series, we've had &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, &quot;Final Night&quot;, &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot;, &quot;Armageddon 2001&quot;, &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;, and host of other imitators, all following the same theme of lots and lots of tiny figures hurling themselves at a Galactus-sized foe for the umpteenth time with porno-quality dialogue.  It's a cynical marketing ploy which idiots fall for again and again.<br />Do yourself a favor.  Instead of reading &quot;Crisis&quot;, pick up Alan Moore's &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Frank Miller's &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, or Neil Gaiman's &quot;Sandman&quot;.  These series had no impact on comic continuity, yet completely transformed the genre nonetheless.  They also feature excellent writing and a plot with a discernible beginning, middle, and end.  They represent what the medium can achieve when not being coopted by the publisher's marketing department and lazy writers.	2001-01-01

Longtime fans will never forget his &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; or his stint on &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;.  <br />Since these mid-80s triumphs, Moore's labored a bit in obscurity.  The gripping &quot;From Hell&quot; didn't appeal to the comics mainstream, nor did &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, but were still well-written and worth the read.  <br />Then Moore started &quot;America's Best Comics&quot;, marking his return to the superhero genre, with a distinct Moore-ish twist, of course.  <br />&quot;Promethea&quot; is Wonder Woman as seen through a realistic lens.  The daughter of a sorceror rescued by mythological gods when her father was murdered, she is immortal, but lives only through possessing the bodies of mortals.  Naturally, she has some supernatural foes to take on and some rather exotic powers, yet the world she inhabits is quite similar to our own in all its ragged glory.<br />I won't reveal any of the plot but will note that it is quite good and reveals Moore to have fallen in love once more with the superhero genre which spawned him.  The illustrations are wonderful as well.	2001-01-01

Marvel Comics in the 60s managed to distinguish itself from the rest of the comics pack with topical stories drenched in pathos.  No Superman in the Marvel Bullpen---the Marvel superheroes always had a touch of human frailty to them.  <br />Iron Man is a good example of this.  Tony Stark was a weapons inventor who was mortally wounded in Vietnam.  When forced to use his last dying days preparing a weapon for his Vietcong captors, Stark turns the tables on his foes by creating a powerful suit of armor, equal parts life support system for his wounded heart and weapon against evil.  <br />The ensuing tales capture that ol' time Marvel magic and introduce unforgettable characters which still resonate today: the Crimson Dynamo, Titanium Man, the Mandarin.  Marvel in this early period had a number of WWII and Korea vets among its writing staff unafraid to take sides in the Cold War---if you have a Che Guevara poster in your bedroom, you're unlikely to enjoy these stories.  Those of us on the victorious side of this conflict, however, will relish them.  <br />Secure your copy of this terrific collection today.	2000-10-18

Those who doubt the magnitude of the debt current comics fans owe to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby need only pick up a copy of &quot;Essential X-Men vol. 1&quot; to become true believers.  Most latter-day X-fans associate all  that is good and pure with this title to Chris Claremont and John Byrne.   As this collection of the first 24 issues of the title shows, however,  Claremont and Byrne were truly standing on the shoulders of giants.  <br />How  many of these fans know, for example, that Lee and Kirby created many of  the X-Men's archenemies? Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.  The  Juggernaut.  The Sentinels (yes, that's right---the Sentinels!).  Much of  the X-Men mythos emerged from the fertile collaboration of Lee and Kirby.   <br />Unfortunately, the X-Men were a bit of an also-ran in the Lee/Kirby  stable.  The stories are fearly pedestrian, the art not as grandiose as we  expect from Kirby, and the title ultimately languished until Claremont and  Byrne brought it back from the ashes like, well, a Phoenix.  <br />Still, this  is a worthy glimpse into the birth of a legendary superteam, and I heartily  recommend this collection to X-philes everywhere.	2000-08-02

Reprinting Avengers 25-46 and King Size Special #1, &quot;Essential Avengers vol. 2&quot; is something of a mixed bag.  Stan Lee hands over the  reins to Roy Thomas at approximately the midway point in the collection,  which is a slight improvement as Thomas injects some fresh blood into a  project which clearly held Lee's interest only flaggingly at the end.  Don  Heck's art looks uniformly execrable throughout, so John Buscema coming on  board for the last third or so is a very welcome change indeed.<br />The  scripts themselves are uneven. While the initial bickering amongst the team  is fairly interesting (if only to hear Captain America, a product of the  40s, exchanging barbs with Hawkeye in perfect 60s tough-guy patois), the  team soon begins to emit affirmations of hero-worship to each other like a  couple of natural-born bootlickers at a Promise Keepers rally (&quot;You're  the man!&quot; &quot;No, you're the man!&quot; &lt;hug&gt;)<br />The initial  promise of Goliath's being trapped at the freakish height of 10 feet tall  is squandered within a few issues, Hercules joins the team in an apparent  attempt to bring Stan Lee's lofty dialogue back, the Wasp is her usual  irrelevant self, and Captain America, the born leader, fails miserably to  control the team and needs Goliath to straighten it out.  <br />The issues do  build some momentum, and classic battles with the Super-Adaptoid and the  Whizzer rekindle the old magic of the Avengers.   <br />Even with all the  aforementioned flaws, this collection of the Avengers still beats most of  the stuff on the newsstand and in the comics shops today.	2000-08-02

For any latter-day comics fans who wonder why Spider-Man, and not the X-Men, remains the most visible character in Marvel's stable today need to  pick up &quot;Essential Spider-Man vol. 2&quot; for a primer on how comics  are written and characters established.  (Chris Claremont, call your  office).  <br />Spider-Man was always obviously the first love of writer Stan  Lee.  Rather than crank out the usual superhero nonsense displayed over at  Marvel's Distinguished Competition for most of the 60s, Lee and artist  Steve Ditko created in Peter Parker a character as unique and compelling as  his alter ego.  As a high schooler blessed with great power but constantly  struggling to balance the demands of his life, Parker is a poignant and  realistic hero.  <br />I will illustrate this with just two examples from this  collection.  In the first, Parker's beloved Aunt May is dying of an  incurable disease he unwittingly introduced to her bloodstream.  To save  her, he needs a rare isotope recently stolen by an enigmatic crime figure.   After frenetically rampaging through New York to unravel this criminal  organization, Spider-Man battles his foe in his headquarters, only to be  buried under tons of machinery as the ceiling collapses and the river  begins to flood in, the isotope a few feet away.  Spider-Man struggles to  free himself despite the enormous weight of the machine, his exhaustion,  and his own nagging self-doubts, knowing that he alone can save the woman  who raised him.  Powerful stuff, indeed, powerfully illustrated in Steve  Ditko's swan song on the series.  <br />Fast forward to his next encounter  with the Green Goblin, a madman who discovers his identity and attacks him  at his house.  Peter Parker, terrified of having his identity exposed or  having his frail aunt exposed to danger, battles the Goblin in his own  front yard, eventually allowing himself to be beaten and dragged away to  the villain's hideout, where he discovers the shocking secret identity of  his foe.  New artist John Romita turns in an incredible performance here.   <br />I highly recommend this collection to all comics fans.  Excelsior!	2000-08-02

As good as the early Fantastic Four issues were, the Avengers took the superteam concept to a whole new level.  Here was a team formed for the noblest of goals, thrown together by the machinations of an evil immortal  only to turn the tables and begin the legendary association which would  have teenagers all over the world shouting &quot;Avengers Assemble!&quot;  in their backyards.  <br />&quot;Essential Avengers vol. 1&quot; captures the  first 24 issues of the classic series, scripted by Stan Lee and illustrated  by Jack Kirby and Don Heck. If the first appearances of Kang the Conqueror,  Immortus, and the Masters of Evil aren't enough for you, pick this  collection up for Avengers # 4, the return of Captain America.  This alone  is enough to mark a substantial return on your investment for this book.   <br />Highly recommended to all comics fans and X-Men fanatics who need a  primer in how team books used to be written.	2000-08-02

Comics fans usually date the Silver Age of the medium from the first appearance of the Fantastic Four in FF#1.  By the time the issues collected  in &quot;Essential Fantastic Four vol.2&quot; appeared, however, the  magazine had lost quite a bit of its initial steam.  Jack Kirby's art still  retained its powerful punch, but Stan Lee's writing began to show the  strain as he tried to crank out multiple Marvel titles every month.  <br />As  a result, the FF went through a number of odd mood swings, such as when Sue  Storm joined the Thing and the Human Torch in trying to oust her own fiance  as leader of the group because he spent too much time working on scientific  projects.  The stoic Mr. Fantastic responds to this leadership challenge  with all the grace of a three-year-old. While the Torch and Thing's  bickering has always been part of the formula, Lee usually plays Richards  and Storm with some nuance.  <br />There is plenty of good stuff here as well.   The first appearance of Dragon Man is a keeper, as are Dr. Doom's  appearances (including the legendary &quot;Battle of the Baxter  Building&quot;).  Of particular interest is a story wherein in the  aftermath of a battle with the Frightful Four, the FF lose their powers and  develop alternate means of taking the fight to their enemies. <br />I  recommend this collection to die-hard FF fans (like they don't already have  it) and Jack Kirby fans interested in the very beginnings of his cosmic  style.  For all others, pick up the first volume instead.	2000-08-02

Action Comics #1 with the emergence of Superman.    Frank Miller's &quot;Batman: The Dark Night Returns&quot;.  And bisecting these two  milestones?  Fantastic Four #1, the comic which gave birth to the Silver  Age.  <br />This legendary issue is included, along with the 19 issues of the  title which followed it, and the 1st FF annual, in &quot;Essential  Fantastic Four vol. 1&quot;.  Each issue is absolutely packed with some of  the most innovative characters and writing ever seen in comics.  Aside from  the truly radical members of the FF (a superteam that bickers?  This ain't  the Justice League), readers are treated to the first appearances of the  Sub-Mariner, the shapeshifting Skrulls, and Dr. Doom.  <br />This is a  top-drawer collection which every comics fan should own.	2000-08-02

Once the Dark Phoenix Saga concluded, the X-Men became a victim of their own success, as the sensational collaboration between Chris Claremont and John Byrne began to sag beneath the weight of the artists' egos.  The  stories became verbose and overwrought as ideas seemed to perpetually  recycle, the art lost much of its previous verve, and the title generally  settled into a long decline.<br />There remain some notable highlights in  &quot;Essential X-Men Vol. 3&quot;, however.  The courtship of Dr. Doom and  Storm is classic and totally unexpected.  The story arc with Cyclops  stranded on a desert isle housing his greatest foe is sensational, as is  the appearance of Dracula (!).  Unfortunately, these high points sink  beneath the weight of drecch like Kitty Pryde's fairytale version of the  X-Men and the touted return of Dark Phoenix.<br />If you're a true fan of  the X-Men, you'll want this collection to avoid bending the corners of your  precious back issues.  Otherwise, grab the first two volumes of this series  instead.	2000-08-02

Simple, classic heroes who immediately bond to the imaginations of  comic fans.  <br />The story here is simple, straightforward, and infused with  a joy that would make Garth Ennis throw up.  Whatever happened to the  comics you didn't mind your kids reading?  <br />If you prefer your comics to  be uplifting and life-affirming, as opposed to the relentless bleakness of  the various X-titles, stop by &quot;Astro City.&quot;  You'll be glad you  did.	2000-08-02

As  long-serving Marvelphiles know, the Hulk was originally cancelled after six  issues as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby found themselves worn thin by all the  other Marvel titles they were cranking out.  The series was later revived  in Tales to Astonish along with a backup feature. <br />Would that the  original series had simply continued, for those first six issues represent  some of the most amazing comics to come out of the Silver Age.  During the  initial run, the Hulk played as more of a Mr. Hyde to Bruce Banner's Dr.  Jekyll, and Banner's noble struggle to control his darker side drove a  powerful tale of regret and redemption, gorgeously illustrated by Jack  Kirby.  As with Mr. Hyde, the Hulk possessed much of his alter ego's  intellect, and actively schemed against his better half to ensure his  survival.  <br />With the &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; run, Lee lost this  momentum and soon turned the Hulk into a pedestrian version of  Frankenstein, a dull-witted, misunderstood freak.  I find this version of  the character to be much less compelling and gnash my teeth at the  &quot;Hulk smash!&quot; dialogue.  <br />The art is terrific, however, and  almost saves the collection.  Aside from Kirby, legends Steve Ditko, John  Buscema, John Romita, and Gil Kane (!) all take a turn at the drawing  board, and no matter how goofy the story gets, the art is invariably  gorgeous.  <br />However, if you read comics for something approximating  writing, you'll be disappointed with much of this collection.  Essential  for true Hulk fans only.	2000-08-02

Now that Marvel Comics has picked over the bones of its original lineup until there is not a sliver of meat left on them, it is refreshing to reread the original stories and realize what a mighty, graceful beast  Marvel once was, back when its writers and artists gave a damn.  <br />\\"The  Essential Spider-Man\\" harkens us back to the early 60s, when an  angst-ridden teenager first was bitten by a radioactive spider and learned  that with great power comes great responsibility.  Stan Lee is often  ridiculed for his overwrought prose, but his Spider-Man tales remain  extremely poignant and affecting some four decades after they were written,  while their postmodern successors seem dated already.  <br />Perhaps the most  amazing thing about the amazing Spider-Man is that Lee creates a  supporting, non-superpowered cast which is often more compelling than the  heroes and villains.  Flash Thompson, Peter Parker's archenemy, is also  Spider-Man's biggest fan, willing to undertake reckless acts of courage to  keep his hero's name from being dragged through the mud.  Betty Brant,  whose brother died after an ill-considered criminal career, loves Peter  Parker but despises his alter ego, building a wall between her and Parker  that neither can breach.   \\"The Essential Spider-Man\\" is packed with such  realistic contradictions.  <br />The collection covers Amazing Fantasy # 15  (the first appearance of Spider-Man) through Amazing Spider-Man # 20 and  Annual # 1.  The tales feature some incredibly fluid artwork by Steve  Ditko, Stan the Man's superlative writing, and the first appearances of  such characters as Sandman, Kraven the Hunter, Dr. Octupus, and the Green  Goblin.  Lee and Ditko's creativity is to be marveled at, given the number  of characters they created during these twenty issues which are still  viable in 2000.  <br />If you're sick of the gorgeous garbage that passes for  comics today, pick up this collection and see what the medium is capable in  the hands of men who love it.	2000-08-01

With the X-men movie lighting up the box office, there is no better time than the present for new fans to be introduced to the classic past of this long-running comic title.   \\"The Essential X-Men Vol. 2\\" delivers, nicely  covering the terrific Chris Claremont/John Byrne run which resurrected the  X-Men and made the book must reading for a generation of comics fans.   <br />The collection features the most tumultuous and terrific two years of  the dynamic duo's run on the book, including the legendary \\"Dark Phoenix\\"  saga and \\"Days of Future Past\\".  During this run (Uncanny X-Men 120-144),  Claremont turned up the realism and alienation a couple of notches and  delivered some incredible stories.  John Byrne's art is bold and detailed  (the black and white presentation here only reinforces his fine pencils).   <br />If the movie left you hungering for more X-Men (and the current spate of  mutant books left you cold), check out this collection  and see what made  this such a great book.	2000-08-01

Neil Gaiman has several recurring themes to which he revisits again and again like the swallows returning to Capostrano.  Foremost among these is the persistence of memory, which is the theme of \\"The Tragical Comedy or  Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch.\\"  <br />The tale revolves around a Punch n' Judy  show at a seaside carnival and how it acts as a trigger for a young boys  memories of his family.  As with much of Gaiman's work, there are tales  within tales here, and the real story he tells is more implied than  elucidated upon.  <br />Dave McKean's art underscores this theme beautifully,  with the \\"real\\" characters in the story as cartoon caricatures while the  puppets look like photographs, exactly the focus with which young children  would concentrate their memories.  Can we not all remember a favorite toy  more easily than our parents faces when we were little?  <br />A marvelous and  poignant tale well worth your time and money.	2000-08-01

While we have seen disturbing trends in  the inroads tweed-jacketed neo-Marxists have made in driving political  correctness into the heads of the foolish and ignorant, we have yet to hit  rock bottom as evidenced by major efforts to understand the childhood  traumas of Josef Stalin, or the various indignities which no doubt turned  Vlad Tepes into Vlad the Impaler.  Whereas the prophets of psychobabble  dominate the present, the past is still replete with good, old-fashioned  monsters, unredeemable through modern psychiatric understanding.  <br />Even  if one day this last rampart of sanity falls to the Prozac-entranced  hordes, I suspect that one figure will remain too horrible to define by any  therapeutic term:  Adolf Hitler.  This is not to say that investigating the  hideous mental character of the archfiend is not worthwhile; just that  comprehending pure evil may be as beyond our ken as understanding the  nature of God.  <br />Besides, Leonard L. and Renate Heston (M.D. and R.N.  respectively) have already conducted a dispassionate study of Hitler which  has been available for the past twenty years.  \\"The Medical Casebook of  Adolf Hitler\\" takes a novel approach to its subject: it merely treats  Hitler as a patient and constructs a complete medical workup based on  accounts accumulated from various high-ranking Nazis.  This historical  approach is fascinating in its simplicity; after all, it is easier (and far  less perilous) to be objective about whether someone complained of sinus  headaches than to report when exactly you learned about Treblinka.   <br />Their findings are shocking and (to a layman such as myself) eminently  credible.  Historians tend to view Hitler as a lucky lunatic, viewing the  mental decline of his latter years as the true Hitler, whereas the  brilliant politician of the war's early years was merely a cunning  disguise.  This \\"rabid dog\\" view of Hitler always struck me as ringing  hollow, as I could not imagine the likes of Erwin Rommel or Heinz Guderian  eagerly embracing a madman.  The authors blame the Fuhrer's very own Dr.  Feelgood for pumping him full of methamphetamine and cocaine, an assertion  which they support with a substantial amount of evidence.  <br />If you're an  avid student of World War II, Hitler, or merely one of the growing number  of history fans who enjoy playing \\"What If?\\", you'll thoroughly enjoy this  book on a much-neglected topic.	2000-08-01

Rather than a simple mathematical problem (1=1), this is the question which dogged the men tasked with rescuing U.S. prisoners of  war during the Vietnam conflict.  <br />There has been the nasty suspicion  lingering for years that the U.S. government decided that the math didn't  quite work out and so left our POWs in Southeast Asia to meet their fates  alone.  Congressional hearings have been held, various recovery missions  have been launched, and a cottage industry in conspiracy theory has sprung  up in the decades since Operation Homecoming in 1973. <br />George Veith blows  the lid off much of the secrecy surrounding U.S. efforts to recover POWs in  Vietnam and thus evaporates much of the conspiracy theories with  &quot;Codename: Bright Light.&quot;  Despite assertions to the contrary,  U.S. special forces made substantial and repeated efforts to free POWs  during the war.  The main obstacles to repatriation were: the constant  relocation of prisoners, the intransigence of the North Vietnamese and  their American supporters, the failure of intelligence on POW matters,  bureaucratic snafus, and the extremely difficult terrain and climate which  made escape a dicey proposition at best.  As a result, the Bright Light  operation failed to rescue a single American POW during its entire  course.<br />Despite these failures, the men supporting Bright Light gave  their all to bring our men home and had a substantive impact upon  repatriation.  Yet most of the surviving members of these teams believe to  this day that men were left behind---specifically, those captured in Laos,  none of whom returned at Homecoming.  <br />Veith has done a great service in  writing this book, which likely will earn him derision in conspiracy  circles.  Despite the demonization of the military brass, Veith portrays  the men of Bright Light and their superiors as doing their best to pull men  outof the maw of hell despite wrestling constantly with the fundamental  question: how many men is one man's life worth?	2000-07-31

Whereas top competitor DC had cranked out superheroes for years, Marvel's heroes always seemed much more  tangible, more human.<br />Much of this is due to Stan Lee's writing.  While  descending into self-parody later, one cannot help but feel a frisson in  reading Lee's early stuff: the angst-ridden Spider-Man, the tumultuous  Fantastic Four, the tortured Hulk.  Lee made heroes and comics that  teenagers could identify with.<br />And then he made the Silver Surfer.<br />The Surfer was a mass of contradictions: a peace-loving alien imbued  with incredible power in the service of world-devouring Galactus; a  faithful herald who betrayed his master; an intergalactic traveller  confined to Earth.  The Surfer was so over-the-top, it was hard for anyone  to identify with him.<br />And yet we love him anyway. Why?  Perhaps because  the Surfer's alien naivete allows us to see the world anew.  Or because  Stan Lee's lofty prose finally seems to have found a suitable subject.<br />Either way, I guarantee you'll love this collection of early Silver  Surfer tales.  Excelsior!	2000-07-31

Stephen King phones it in.  <br />&quot;Storm of the Century&quot; is King at his worst.  The characters are two-dimensional (even for television, for which the screenplay was written), the villain is silly in the Randall  Flagg fashion which made the latter half of &quot;The Stand&quot;  unreadable, and the climax is probably the nadir of the book.  <br />The book  itself is in screenplay form, which may throw people unused to reading  plays.  Of particular interest is King's little throwaway, profanity-laced  directions; one necessarily wonders if these were in the original  screenplay or if he added them to bulk up the book and thus his payday.   <br />The story concerns a malevolent stranger who arrives on a small Maine  island just as a major winter storm hits.  People start dying in banally  brutal fashion, usually after someone writes &quot;Give me what I want and  I'll go away&quot; in their blood.  <br />Naturally, speculation centers on  the stranger who just happened to beat an old woman to death and wrote the  same message in her blood.  Now, if this took place in L.A. and the villain  was O.J. Simpson, we might expect some suspense as to whether the dimbulb  citizenry would ever put the two together, but even in Maine the yokels  have some concept of reality and so the villain is cast into the island's  lone jail cell.  Unfortunately, people keep getting knocked off.  Could  Faye Resnik be involved?  A.C. Cowlings?  Kato Kaelin?  Or could the fanged  dude in the cell somehow have supernatural powers?<br />All of this makes the  book seem more suspenseful than it is. King having spent the better part of  the last couple of years recovering from a near fatal run-in with a van, I  can't really blame him for phoning it in this time out.  <br />I would  recommend, however, that you stay away from this book and grab some earlier  King instead.	2000-07-31

I am thus woefully unprepared to evaluate &quot;The Hidden Book in the Bible&quot; on its merits as an academic work.  <br />Having become moderately familiar with the  major schools of thought on the development of the Bible, I can say that  the author clearly favors an evolutionary development of the Bible, placing  him at odds to some extent with those who believe it to be the  divinely-inspired word of God.  <br />Friedman here has attempted to link  together like-sounding passages from the Old Testament which he attributes  to the Yahwist (the author he believes is distinctive for referring to the  God of the Jews as YHWH). The resulting book tells the story of the Bible  from the creation of the world until the reign of King Solomon.   <br />Surprisingly, the story is cohesive, lending some credence to the claim  that this was the sturdy scaffolding upon which later authors  (divinely-inspired or no) built.  <br />All in all, I found the book to be an  entertaining read, and a bit of fun in its attempt to puncture preconceived  notions about the Bible.  I thus recommend it, but am incapable of  evaluating it on its scholarly merits.	2000-07-06

They immediately took to the airwaves in droves to decry the  &quot;racism&quot; of the authors, and put out a bunch of hastily-written  garbage to refute the book which apparently none of them had read.  <br />Thus  it may surprise you to learn that the section on ethnic differences in  cognitive ability is but 70 pages out of 845 in the book, and that the most  &quot;controversial&quot; finding within these 70 pages is that,  historically, blacks on average have scored lower than whites on tests of  cognitive ability, and that whites have scored lower on average than  Asians.  (Far from being white supremacists, the authors are apparently  Asian supremacists, if we follow the Left's overwrought arguments.)<br />But  the attention paid to race and ethnicity is merely a strawman for the Ivory  Tower Marxists.  The actual thesis of the book, as proven by a plethora of  empirical evidence, is this: that in analyzing America, intelligence is a  far more accurate predictor of success than class origin, and that the  current stratification of American society is due to differences in  cognitive ability rather than in social class.  The Left understands that  this is the death nell for the Marxist dream, and has pulled out all the  stops to suppress this book.    <br />Yet is this controversial?  As we enter  the Information Age, it is clear that the intellectual Haves have clear  advantages over the Have Nots.  Only 20% of Americans access the Internet  regularly.  Would it surprise anyone to see a positive correlation between  Internet usage and scores on IQ tests?  <br />Is anyone amazed that criminals  tend to be dumb, regardless of the social class they were born into?  Or  that stupid scions of wealthy families usually blow their money, while  bright sons and daughters of poor families seem to do quite well? <br />The  thesis isa yawner.  What is appaling is that in America, the Left has had  such success in creating a culture of class envy that we now find the  obvious connection between brains and success astounding.  Herrnstein and  Murray, to their lasting credit, have once again proven that the truth will  out, no matter how inconvenient for some.  <br />For the record, my father was  a bricklayer, I score quite well on cognitive tests, and I am doing very  well in the corporate technology sector.  I thus tend to sympathize with  the authors' thesis and find the Birkenstock Bolsheviks of academia to lack  credibility on this issue, as all others.  <br />Grab this book and give it a  thorough read if you're at all interested in intelligence, statistics,  sociology, or simply want to know what all the fuss was about in an  unfiltered fashion.  You won't be sorry, no matter where you fall on the  Bell Curve.	2000-07-06

At GE, Six Sigma training entails two full weeks  of study, two huge binders of reference material, then the completion of at  least two projects under the watchful eyes of the Six Sigma Black Belt  community.  Even after all this, true comprehension remains  elusive.<br />Fortunately, &quot;Implementing Six Sigma&quot; serves as a  handy reference work to help guide us through the tangled thickets of Six  Sigma.  Aside from providing numerous examples of how and when to use each  of the tools in the Six Sigma toolkit, the work also frankly discusses why  the methodology succeeds or fails (a lot of which has to do with the way it  is implemented), and gives a good general overview of the principles behind  the methodology.<br />The one negative about the work is the lack of a  comprehensive summary.  There is a smorgasbord of tools to use; when on  earth is someone going to produce a handy 2-page guide to what to use when?   The book is also sadly a bit light on Design for Six Sigma principles;  let's face it---quality gurus tend to focus exclusively on product  improvement and not on business process improvement, yet the driving force  behind hidden factory costs is the inefficiency of business processes  themselves.  This is a glaring omission in any work which calls itself  comprehensive in scope.<br />Still, this is a reference work which belongs on  the shelf of anyone interested in Six Sigma or in the improvement of  manufacturing processes.  Despite the hefty price tag, it truly is the best  single-volume reference to Six Sigma available.	2000-07-06

Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Lucid and Indispensable Study of Classical Warfare	The number of misconceptions about ancient warfare is legion.  There is a tendency to see ancient battles as little more than bloody scrums, with none of the tactical art, deception, or finesse of modern battle.  Indeed,  the tactics and weaponry are often perceived as being static, nowhere near  as fluid as those of today.  <br />John Warry punctures all of these myths  with his seminal work &quot;Warfare in the Classical World&quot;, which  covers the Greek and Roman art of war in a single slim, accessible volume.   <br />Warry does not fall into the trap which often befalls military  historians in that he strives to place each conflict in its proper  political context.  Surprisingly, there is not a single battle map in the  book, as he is for the most part concerned with how armies fight and not  the results of single battles.  <br />In each section, Warry begins with an  incisive commentary on the sources from which we have inherited our  historical knowledge, probing the biases of each.  He then describes the  political scene of the day before analyzing the art of war as practiced at  the time, finally wrapping up with a brief summary.<br />This makes for highly  entertaining and thought-provoking reading, and allows the reader to grasp  the evolution of land and naval warfare from the Homeric Age to the fall of  Rome.  <br />And what an evolution this was, from the individual, hand-to-hand  combat of the Heroic Greeks to the extremely disciplined and varied tactics  of the Roman Legion.  Ancient warfare was anything but a static affair as  brilliant warriors constantly sought the battlefield edge through new  tactics and weaponry.  <br />Take, for example, the evolution of the spear,  from the short, thrusting weapon used by early Greek phalangists to the  throwing spear represented by the Roman pilum, craftily designed so as to  make the shields of the barbarian hordes they faced useless.  Or the rise  and fall of elephants in battle, first used by Persians battling the  Greeks, then employed by the Carthaginians against Rome before falling out  of favor with Hannibal's defeat at Zama.  Talk about heavy cavalry!<br />This  book will delight even the most casual interest in military history or the  ancient world.  For the professional soldier, this work is an essential  reference which belongs on your bookshelf, if only to convince the boss  that you do study your profession.

Following up on his 1986 renovation of the Batman myth with &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, Frank Miller teamed with David Mazzucchelli to produce &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;, a novel retelling of how Bruce Wayne  came to don tights to fight crime.  <br />Miller's Gotham City is a corrupt  and festering cesspool, much as he would later depict in his Sin City  series.  Two good men come to town to clean things up: Bruce Wayne and Jim  Gordon, a new detective on the Gotham police force fresh from his role in  cleaning up another police department.  <br />Wayne himself has returned to  his hometown after a long absence, during which he trained himself to  become a vigilante.  Wayne's first foray into crimefighting nearly ends in  disaster, but leads him ultimately to adopt the Batman motif to frighten  criminals.  Gordon becomes his unlikely ally as he strives to clean up  Gotham's police department.  <br />The writing remains more mature and gritty  than the typical comic book fare of the time.  Batman is not the invincible  denizen of the dark we've come to know and love, but an awkward guy in a  goofy costume who seems always to be within an inch of death.  Gordon is no  paragon of virtue either; the main subplot deals with his affair with  another cop while his wife waits to give birth to his son.<br />The result is  a gripping, gritty, and ultimately redeeming tale which once again  reinvents the familiar figure of the Batman.	2000-07-06

With most Americans blissfully unaware of the workings of simple machines,  is it any surprise that every ancient invention showing a modicum of  engineering skill is treated as proof that aliens have visited Earth?   <br />With their previous book, James and Thorpe debunked a bunch of nonsense  regarding ancient inventions and proved that man has always possessed the  ability to build elegant and useful tools.  With &quot;Ancient  Mysteries&quot;, they cast their net a bit wider, and basically put Leonard  Nimoy's &quot;In Search Of...&quot; program in the dustbin where it  belongs.  <br />Whether addressing the mystery of the Sphinx, the statues of  Easter Island, Stonehenge, or the Inca &quot;roads&quot;, the authors bring  a light touch and a jeweler's eye for the truth to the topic.  They are  unafraid to deviate from orthodoxy where necessary; they posit, for  example, that much of the ancient artwork depicting very large comets were  faithful depictions of an ancient comet much larger than Halley's.  And,  generally speaking, they argue their case persuasively.  <br />This is a great  summer read for anyone who has a genuine interest in the ancient world.   Crystal-worshippers need not apply.	2000-07-06

This gives artist Dave Gibbons a great deal of flexibility  in his depiction of the story and allows him to employ a variety of  cinematic storytelling techniques to the project.<br />For his part, Moore  turns in a tightly-plotted take on a world in which costumed crimefighters  are quite real, dominated by the godlike Dr. Manhattan.  The murder of one  of their own brings these crimefighters out of government-enforced  retirement to answer the question: &quot;Who Watches the  Watchmen?&quot;<br />This is a phenomenal work which illustrates once and for  all the potential of the comic book genre.  Even if you are not a comics  fan, you will find &quot;Watchmen&quot; to be exceptional.	2000-07-06

When a cop is killed in Old  Town, the protagonist takes great pains to cover up the death and protect  the women from the repercussions.  Mayhem ensues.<br />When &quot;Sin  City&quot; first appeared, it was a revelation.  The use of negative space,  the noir elements, the over-the-top scripting, all served to separate it  from that which had come before.  With &quot;The Big Fat Kill&quot;,  Miller's enthusiasm for the series seems to be on the wane.  Essential for  Sin City completists only.	2000-07-06

Geyer makes clear that  Castro is a power-mad dictator first, and a Communist second.  From his  earliest days as a Cuban street thug to his corpulent posturing of today,  the only loyalty to man or cause Fidel Castro has shown is to himself.   <br />This was evident in his brutal treatment of his wife, ironically the  daughter of a pro-American businessman and quite well off.  If you're of  the Marxism Forever crowd, prepare to tear those Che Guevara posters of the  wall of your parents' home when you read about how Castro betrayed his  righthand man as he strove to consolidate his power in Havana.  And lets  not forget the millions of dead and incarcerated political enemies who will  shake their bloody fists at Fidel when he gets to his final  reward....<br />Perhaps most interesting of all, Geyer uncovers an  illuminating incident from 1956 in which Castro waged a vicious custody  battle over his son Fidelito.  As his ex-wife was preparing to remarry,  Castro sent for his son.  His wife asked him for his word of honor that he  would be returned to her within two weeks.  He agreed.  After five weeks,  he finally told his ex-wife that his son would not be raised by thugs.  He  then renamed him and gave him to two of his Mexican patrons to raise.  With  the help of Mexican police, his son was eventually returned (temporarily)  to his mother.  In the end, of course, Castro stripped his ex-wife of her  child when he came to power and raised Fidelito as a model Communist.   <br />This story has some rather obvious bearing on the Elian affair, yet was  of no interest to the American media.  <br />I bet that it and the rest of  this excellent biography will be of interest to you.  Pick it up now, and  learn the full story of one of the most evil and charismatic men of the  20th century.	2000-07-06

As a junior officer in Turkey during a minor special forces operation, I had no problem at all ordering troops not to say a word to Christiane Amanpour,  the CNN reporter lurking outside the gate of the base as the mission took  off.  The press is rarely of any help to the operation, and often a great  hindrance.  This is due in part to the fact that most of the press hate the  military, a bias which invariably shows up in their coverage.  <br />Reading  &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, by Mark Bowden, a reporter with the  Philadelphia Inquirer, has caused me to reevaluate some of my preconceived  notions about war journalism.  <br />It is clear from the first page of his  narrative that Bowden is taking great pains to tell it like it really was.   While Bowden devotes much of the story to the Somali point of view, he is  scrupulously fair, and avoids giving away any of his own opinions regarding  the Battle of Mogadishu.<br />And what a battle it was.  It began with a  routine operation to capture a few aides to Aidid, the Somali warlord who  was the bete noire of the Clinton administration until Slobodan Milosevic  crawled out from under his rock.  Delta Force personnel, aided by U.S. Army  Rangers, entered the city via helicopter and convoy to conduct the  operation.  <br />The Somalis were not caught unawares this time.  They had  rehearsed firing rocket propelled grenades at Black Hawk helicopters prior  to this ill-fated mission, now they succeeded in bringing two of the  nigh-invulnerable choppers down.  <br />A pitched battle, full of the fog and  friction of war, ensued about the crash sites as the Americans fought  frantically to rescue their comrades.  <br />Bowden relates this gripping tale  in a tense, minute-by-minute narrative.  Having conducted extensive  interviews, he manages to reconstruct the battle and dissect it at the same  time.  <br />Too often, military history portrays the glory of battle with  none of the horror it invariably entails.  Bowden skillfully avoids this  trap as well, portraying eloquently the sacrifices of the 18 U.S. soldiers  who died in the battle.  <br />In this, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; compares  favorably with another classic of the genre, &quot;We Were Soldiers  Once...And Young&quot; by General Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway, which  adopted the same &quot;Just the facts, ma'am&quot; approach to the battle  of Ia Drang during Vietnam.  <br />If you have any interest at all in what the  modern battlefield is really like, pick this book up now.	2000-07-05

Mirroring Hitler's ascent over the ashes  of the Weimar Republic, the Norsefire party seizes power in Britain and  restores order at a horrible price.  <br />That is, until a stylish terrorist  in a Guy Fawkes mask codenamed &quot;V&quot; appears on the scene to tear  the new order down.  <br />&quot;V for Vendetta&quot; marks a major departure  from comic book style.  David Lloyd's cinematic style plays like a  storyboard for a film; gone are the motion lines and Batman-esque sound  effects so familiar to comic readers.  Lloyd also dispenses with one of the  comic writer's main crutches for exposition---the thought balloon.  The  story is thus relayed entirely by motion and dialogue, deepening the  inherent mystery of the plot as we try to comprehend the master plan of the  inscrutable antihero &quot;V&quot;.  <br />As with &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Moore  has layered his tale with enormous depth, making subsequent readings a must  to truly comprehend all that's going on within the plot.  <br />If you're  interested in seeing what the comic art form is capable of when geared  toward an adult audience, rush out and grab a copy of &quot;V for  Vendetta&quot; today.	2000-05-22

Miller single-handedly reinvented the superhero genre with his seminal &quot;Batman: The Dark Night Returns&quot; in 1986, then took on a flagging Daredevil title and made it the most gripping reading  available in the comic book racks. Even the X-Clone fans had to applaud  Miller for breathing life into a dying medium.  <br />And then he created  &quot;Sin City,&quot; making everything which came before seem amateurish  in comparison.<br />&quot;Sin City&quot; is the story of a  down-on-his-luck,dumb schlub named Marv who wanders into a tangled  situation he cannot begin to understand.  Naturally, his life heads  straight down the toilet immediately after making love to an incredibly  beautiful woman.   Marv's single-minded pursuit of vengeance consumes the  remainder of the series in true film noir fashion.<br />I could go on and on  about the classic noir elements Miller blends into the tale, the obvious  glee he takes in crafting this work, or the extraordinary nature of the  villain he has constructed to be Marv's foil.  <br />Forget all that and look  at the art.  It explodes off the page in glorious black and white.   Miller's use of light and shadow and the cinematic nature of his  composition is the most remarkable thing I have seen in the medium.  The  best way I can describe the illustrations in this series is to say it looks  like a storyboard Orson Welles would have put together for &quot;Touch of  Evil.&quot;  <br />Let's face it: &quot;Sin City&quot; is no  &quot;Othello.&quot;  (&quot;Titus Andronicus,&quot; maybe,  &quot;Othello,&quot; no.) But Miller's not looking to create great  literature here, as Chris Claremont often attempts in his overwrought  &quot;X-Men.&quot;  Instead, he's treating his fans to a tightly-wound,  suspenseful romp through a visceral urban swamp.  <br />This is a book you'll  read straight through to the shocking end, and I heartily recommend it to  anyone tired of the Todd McFarlane clones and their spandex jive.	2000-05-04

If you're into ancient gods and horror beyond compare, you  won't find it here.  <br />But if you're literary jones is only sated by the  kind of extraordinary-ordinary situations real people experience in the  real world from time to time, the kind of story which stays with you long  after you've returned the book to its shelf, stick around awhile.   <br />\\"Signal to Noise\\" is the story of a screenwriter racing against the  clock to finish his final screenplay.  It is also the story of simple  peasants waiting for the world to end at the dawn of the second millenium.   It is also the story of the immortality of art.  It is all these things and  more; which will surprise exactly none of Gaiman's fans, familiar as they  are with his flair for layered storytelling.  <br />The art is a revelation.   I had previously been of the opinion that Dave McKean's distinctive art  style evolved during his Sandman run, building on his \\"Arkham Asylum\\" work.   I was clearly mistaken:  \\"Signal to Noise\\" is classic McKean; that is, the  artwork is unlike anything you've seen before yet does not draw focus away  from the story itself.  <br />I have studiously avoided commenting on the  plot.

William A.  Dembski, who managed to obtain advanced degrees in both mathematics and philosophy, brought together a number of these persecuted souls for a conference on the singularly unhip topic of creationism.  <br />The ensuing essays in \\"Mere Creation\\" are guaranteed to change the way you view the world.  To glean some highlights from the numerous arguments favoring intelligent design of the universe:<br />The Universe began with the Big Bang, the instant of time when all matter and energy came into existence in an enormous explosion.  Despite the Universe's seeming complexity, it is governed by only a tiny handful of physical laws.  Should any of these governing principles be altered in the slightest (a bit less gravity, for example), life could not exist.  The odds of life arising naturally are infinitesimally small.  Genetic mutation, the means for transferring traits so crucial to the theory of evolution, always results in the loss of information, making beneficial mutation much less likely.  There is no evidence of interspecies evolution extant. <br />If you have the slightest interest in how our Universe came about, or pondered the existence of God, or even simply distrust the dogma constantly shoveled around by tweed-jacketed academics who haven't had a new idea since Che Guevara's book came out, you'll thoroughly enjoy \\"Mere Creation.\\"	2000-05-02

From the  earliest days of her existence, this is a woman who has pursued power with  the same single-minded determination with which her husband pursues bimbos.   <br />Unfortunately, her book does not include much that will be new to  veteran Hillary-haters like myself (I can hear the Clintonista sycophants  clicking on \\"Not helpful\\" now).  Her transformation from lukewarm limousine  liberal Republican to full-blown hippie harpy is well known (and fully  documented with grotesque photos!), as is her odd relationship with her  Oprahfied husband.  Her lust for power and devious pursuit of the same is  also familiar to those of us who would have taken to the streets like the  Black Panthers of old had her socialist reconstruction of our health care  system actually gone anywhere.  Quite frankly, given her lot's penchant for  using the federal government to destroy anyone who stands against their  nutty ambitions and narcissistic schemes, there's not going to be any new  information on the Lady Macbeth of Little Rock until Chelsea's book hits  the stands decades hence.  <br />While Olson's tome does raise a couple of  interesting questions (whatever did happen to the baby Hillary claimed she  and Bubba were looking to adopt during the '96 campaign anyway?), on the  whole it is satisfying neither as screed, polemic, nor investigative  journalism.  It reveals neither why anyone believes a word this woman has  to say on any subject nor why Americans buy into the Saint Hillary nonsense  at the drop of a fresh-baked cookie.  In the end, this is the only thing of  interest in the tale of this modern-day Medusa.	2000-05-02

Anyone want a coffee table  book filled with blood and gore?  Put your hand down, Hannibal  Lecter.<br />\\"300\\" is an absolutely stunning recounting of the heroism of the  ancient Spartans as they stood and fell before the might of the largest  armed force on the planet.   Fans of Xenophon and Thucydides will instantly  recognize the ancient Greece depicted herein; the furious discipline of the  bristling phalanx, the oppressive heat of the campaign, the rhythmic thud  of the marching battalions.  Leonidas gleams like the hero-kings of old  always do in our imagination, noble and cruel.  This simple tale of how one  man refused to allow the glory of Greece to fade before a barbarous horde  is punctuated by breathtaking battle scenes, glorious heroism, and base  treachery.  This is truly the power of the comic book medium, a power  well-remembered by those of us who dropped the melodrama and tissue paper  plots of the X-clones long ago.  <br />Bravo, Mr. Miller, and thanks for  recalling us to a nobler, bolder, though hardly more savage age.

To almost no one's surprise, Miller completely retooled the  medium with his take on film noir in \\"Sin City\\".  <br />How radical was this  alteration in Miller's artistic vision?  <br />In a world of garish,  computer-derived colors, Miller constructed a world of broad swaths of  black ink.  In a medium dominated increasingly by splash pages linked by   plots beneath the sophistication level of your average porno movie, Miller  delivered a compelling satire of modern urban existence.  In an industry  increasingly convinced of its own sociological significance, Miller crafts  a tale so over-the-top in its violent imagery as to eradicate any claim to  stature amongst the Starbucks set.  <br />How do you follow up the outstanding  statement that was \\"Sin City\\"?<br />You don't.  <br />\\"A Dame to Kill For\\" finds  Miller clearly less infatuated with the vision that fairly screamed from  his pen in the prior tale.  The art, while still visually stunning in  places and always crafted with a cinematic flair, seems somehow rushed  here, as though the languid love affair he previously had with his imagery  has cooled to a Thursday night quickie.  <br />The plot involves a sleazy  photographer whose past returns to haunt him in horrific fashion.  As in  the best film noir, nothing is as it initially seems, motives are rarely  clear, and the hero takes a terrific beating along the way to both body and  sensibility.  Unfortunately, Miller's portrayal of the villain here is less  nuanced than his past work, detracting from the psychological reality he is  apparently trying to convey.  <br />This is an eminently forgivable sin in the  noir world.  Did anyone truly believe that Bogart's Spade really wouldn't  pack Mary Astor off to the big house at the end of \\"TheMaltese Falcon\\"?   Did anyone not find the melodramatic finale to \\"D.O.A.\\" to ultimately ring  hollow?  Not likely, but neither did this diminish these films' stature as  classics of the noir genre; after all, the noir world is in the final  analysis a distorted vision of our own painted solely from the duskier hues  of the palette.<br />While not a story to die for as was \\"Sin City\\", \\"A Dame  to Kill For\\" is still a story well worth your time.	2000-04-28

A successful cavalry commander while still  in his teens, Alexander took the reins of an up-and-coming minor power and  turned Macedonia into the preeminent power in the known world.  He built a  powerful navy from scratch to challenge the Persian Empire, subdued the  contentious Greeks, and conquered Darius.  He founded the greatest library  of the ancient world at Alexandria, contributing immeasurably to the  dispersion of knowledge across the world.  He was a student of Aristotle  and as skilled in statecraft and diplomacy as in war.  Aside from his  skills as a leader, Alexander was a powerful hand to hand combatant,  possessed of a deep fount of personal courage.  He was a hero straight out  of Greek mythology, with all the tragedy and triumph the canon contained.   <br />It should thus come as no surprise that the life of Alexander would  capture the imagination of academics and warriors alike through the ages.   Innumerable accounts of his life have been written, the best to date by  Arrian and Theodore Ayrault Dodge.  <br />Add Peter Green to the top of the  heap.  His Alexander of Macedon incorporates the work of previous  biographers with the most recent research into a breezy narrative which  captures the awe and majesty of Alexander's reign.  <br />Green takes us to  Tyre, where the young king displays the patience of his Greek forebears  besieging Troy in building a land bridge to the island city in order for  his army to subdue it.  We then hopscotch across the near East with the  Macedonian army as it conquers its way to Babylon, heart of the Persian  Empire.  The battles are recounted dramatically and with an eye to detail;  Green knows his audience includes plenty of grognards who know the material  nearly as well as he.  <br />Green does not shy from the controversial  arguments arising of late.  He takes on the possibility that Alexander  arranged the death of his father Philip II in order to usurp the throne,  and ruminates on the King's well-known love for the vine.  He investigates  the potential cause of the fever that would ultimately lay him low (was it  poison, typhoid, or something else entirely?  Read this book and you'll  see).  <br />This is easily the most accessible and informative biography of  Alexander the Great available in English today.  If you have the slightest  interest in military history, the Greek world, or biography, get your copy  of this outstanding book today.	2000-03-05

It is beautifully crude and sophomoric in a manner  Mad magazine no longer aspires to, and for readers looking for some deathly  funny satire in this politically-correct, can't-we-all-just-get-along,  sissified age, it is a lighthouse in a stormy sea.  <br />So what's Our Dumb  Century about?  It is a parody of those fin-de-siecle commemoratives most  major newspapers put out last year, ignorant of the fact that we still have  a year left in the 20th century.  <br />The book allegedly reprints the front  pages of the last 100 years of the Onion during critical times in the  nation's history.  The writers accurately ape the style of newspapers  throughout this period, from the cluttered text columns of the early 1900s  to the graphic-intensive layouts of today.  <br />Of course it's the stories  themselves that hit you where you live.  1902-&quot;Republics Negroes Still  Waiting for 40 Acres, Mule--Agriculture Secretary Faults Low Mule, Acreage  Availability at Present.&quot;  1918-&quot;Corpse-Eating Rats Now Largest  Military Force in Europe.&quot; 1934-&quot;FDR Creates 300,000 Jobs With  'Tunnel to New Zealand' Project.&quot;  1945-&quot;Hitler Commits Suicide;  Ravaging of Europe a 'Desperate Cry for Help', Say Therapists.&quot;  Or my  favorite from 1963-&quot;Kennedy Slain by CIA, Mafia, Castro, LBJ,  Teamsters, Freemasons--President Shot 129 Times from 43 Different  Angles.&quot; Oliver Stone was right!<br />If you're up for slaughtering some  sacred cows with a smile and have more of a sense of humor than your  typical Thought Police apparatchik, this may be the book for you.	2000-03-04

Wherever one thinks his  story is headed at the beginning, one can be guaranteed the destination is  altogether different, yet still plausible.  Grisham, on the other hand, is  a Democratic Party hack who writes formulaically in the typical paranoid  corporate conspiracy fashion we've come to expect from Oliver Stone and the  rest of the Hollywood set.  The law is invariably a tool used to set the  Vast Right Wing Conspiracy straight in a Grisham novel; with Turow it's a  much more ambiguous tool.  Choosing between Grisham and Turow is like  choosing between comic books and literature.<br />Enter &quot;Personal  Injuries,&quot; Turow's latest.  Robbie Feaver is a smiling, corrupt  attorney in Turow's fictional Kindle County, Mississippi.  Feaver gets by  on Southern charm, lack of scruples, and an occasional genuine desire to do  the right thing, although he tends to rationalize &quot;right&quot; to suit  whichever is easiest for him at the time.  Feaver coasts along bribing  judges to secure courtroom victories until he becomes ensnared in an FBI  probe of the Kindle County court system.  <br />Enter Evon Miller, a Clarice  Starling-esque FBI agent assigned to protect Feaver as he turns state's  evidence and participates in a federal sting operation.  Evon's distaste  for Feaver is clear from the beginning, although one can bet that she will  not remain totally cool and aloof for long.  <br />The investigation which  ensues is typically (for Turow, anyway) labyrinthine and compelling,  building to a shocking climax one will not soon forget.  Turow has drawn  more complex characters this time out than was the case with &quot;Presumed  Innocent&quot; or &quot;Burden of Proof,&quot; and as the storyevolves  these characters come into their own.  <br />Unfortunately, it takes Turow far  too long to build up momentum for his tale.  The first third or so of the  book is hard going; I believe many readers may simply put it down at this  point.  Tighter editing and a slightly quicker pace would have helped  immeasurably here.  Once the story takes off, however, Turow returns to  form and readers are in for a rollercoaster ride.  <br />I should also note  (without giving plot points away) that Turow is careful to avoid cliches  throughout.  Nothing is completely as it seems in Kindle County, and even  the old standbys of a romantic relationship between the lead characters is  handled quite differently from what you would expect here.  It is this  willingness to walk new paths with his writing which makes Turow so much  more compelling than Grisham in the end.  It is a shame that more of this  novel's payoff couldn't be packed into the first half.  <br />As such, I  recommend this book only to Turow's fans.  If you're looking to become a  Turow fan, start with &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; instead.	2000-03-04

His characters often struggle to come to grips with their dimly-remembered pasts (take Rose Walker in &quot;The Doll's House&quot; or any of the  characters in &quot;A Game of You&quot; from The Sandman, or even the  protagonists of &quot;Black Orchid.&quot;)  <br />&quot;Violent Cases&quot;  explores the gauzy environs of childhood memory.  As he would later attempt  with much more poignant effect in &quot;The Tragical Comedy of Mr.  Punch,&quot;  Gaiman here examines a grown man's efforts to make sense out  of violence in his dimly-remembered past, in this case revolving around a  man who may have been Al Capone's osteopath.  <br />The tale, while simple, is  masterfully plotted, allowing the reader to make connections the narrator  himself may not make.  While the telling is a bit ham-handed in spots (you  can almost see Gaiman grinning smugly at certain points; not a good thing),  one must reflect that this was written quite early in the author's career,  and marked quite a departure from comic book conventions.  Even Art  Spiegelman felt it necessary to use some of the art's cliches in his  groundbreaking &quot;Maus&quot;; Gaiman chooses to ignore them quite  audaciously. <br />The artwork by Dave McKean shows a strong Sienkiewicz  influence almost wholly alien to his later work, yet still quite appealing.   <br />I highly recommend &quot;Violent Cases&quot; to anyone with a more  mature taste in comic books and to fans of Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's  body of work.  Although an early effort, &quot;Violent Cases&quot; clearly  presages the glory to come for this most successful comic book  collaboration.	2000-02-14

The story itself is not quite as laudable  on its own merits, however.  <br />Gaiman continues his early apprenticeship  under Alan Moore and Rick Veitch here, and this work could be viewed as an  open homage to the latter's run on &quot;Swamp Thing.&quot;  The stable of  Swamp Thing characters appear here at various points and fans of this comic  will undoubtedly find the tale familiar.  <br />Of greater interest is  Gaiman's attempt to take an obscure DC character and breath fresh life (and  a bit of the supernatural) into it.  While the initial shock of how he  intends &quot;Black Orchid&quot; to depart from the conventions of the  superhero genre is spoiled by the introduction (trust me: read this LAST),  it still has impact, and shows the audacity we would come to expect of  Gaiman later.  <br />The rest of the tale doesn't quite hold up.  Perhaps  Gaiman lost steam after the breathtaking first installment and didn't know  quite how to wrap it up; perhaps giving birth to The Sandman soaked up all  his creative oxygen and left this story in the lurch.  Regardless, the last  few chapters of the story meander all over the place and resolve themselves  in a wholly unsatisfactory manner.  <br />The artwork is vintage McKean and  quite beautiful.  The illustrator shows a great willingness to take chances  with perspective and color to enhance the narrative and it is clear that  McKean at this early stage possesses more confidence than Gaiman.  <br />I  recommend &quot;Black Orchid&quot; to Gaiman &amp; McKean fans interested  in the early stages of their partnership, warts and all, and to Swamp Thing  fans curious to see how the milieu is translated by the author.  Otherwise,  I'm afraid this is of only marginal value to comic book readers.	2000-02-12

Ryan combined the meticulous research of the  historian, the nose for rooting out the story of a journalist, and the plot  and pacing of a novelist into a package heretofore unequaled.  <br />Having  read both of the above works (and seen the movies, along with most of  America), I prefer &quot;The Last Battle.&quot;  This account of the fall  of Berlin shows Ryan at the top of his gain as he weaves together disparate  tales of struggle amidst the ashes of the Thousand Year Reich into a  sweeping narrative of survival.  <br />Most of the work is told from the point  of view of the encircled Germans, from the general charged with the  impossible mission of defending the Nazi capitol with nothing more than  teenagers and grit to the women who vowed to take cyanide rather than  endure rape at the hands of the conquering Russians.  <br />Through it all,  Ryan succeeds in recreating the dense atmosphere of dread which descended  over Berlin in the closing days of the war, making all the more poignant  our realization of the terrible tidal wave of suffering unleashed by the  Nazi madmen who initiated the conflict.  <br />This is not merely a tale of  good and evil, however, and the Allies do not come off very well.  Aside  from the plundering savages amidst the Soviet rank-and-file, readers may be  surprised at the depiction of top American and British commanders'  indifference to the fate of German civilians.  (Although given the  lingering shock at the Nazi atrocities uncovered mere weeks before at  Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, and other death camps, one should not be too  surprised).  <br />Particularly damning is Ryan's assertion that, despite all  the talk of the Allies' planning the partition of Germany and Berlin at  Yalta, there was no agreement to any line of partition between the Allies  at the time of this battle.  No one had given much thought to the shape of  the postwar world in the West; millions of people were sacrificed to the  Soviets as an afterthought.  <br />If you prefer your military history at the  trench level, drenched in blood and chromite, this book is for you.	2000-02-11

As Lt. Col. Dave Grossman shows in his  groundbreaking study of killing in war, nothing could be further from the  truth.  <br />Remember the steely-eyed warriors who descended on Normandy,  Anzio, Guadalcanal, and a host of other blood-soaked battlegrounds during  World War II?  Only one in five of these combat infantrymen were willing to  fire their rifles.  <br />Shocking?  Surely, given the popular depiction of  our fighting men.  But military training has never been able to fully  eradicate the innate resistance of killing one's fellow man amongst the  common soldiery.  <br />Yet we're getting better at it, with disturbing  implications for our society.  Grossman's data shows that the current crop  of soldiers, raised on graphic violence in movies and video games, is much  more willing to slay the enemy.  This is undoubtedly a good thing from a  purely military point of view.  However, the cost is a consequent  desensitization to the suffering of friend and foe alike, and psychological  trauma which lasts long after the firing stops.  <br />The introduction of  women into combat situations has not slowed the inexorable trend toward a  more savage soldier.  During training to endure potential captivity as  prisoners of war, male soldiers are taught to conquer their natural  tendencies to protect females through an active desensitization process (a  soldier is a soldier, whether male or female; we all signed up for this,  etc.)  What impact this has once these brave men return to society is  uncertain, but you can bet that one cannot turn their humanity on and off  like a light switch.  <br />A profound and disturbing study which belongs in  every library.	2000-02-11

The backwoods colonists of the New World handily defeated the trained  soldiers of the Old and so liberated the world, paving the way for  modernity.  <br />Thankfully, this is not so.  <br />Thankfully, because the  responsibility for the curse of absolutism and the rise of oppressive,  autocratic states so endemic in the 19th and 20th centuries falls squarely  on the revered sans-culottes of France.  <br />Reactionary, you say?  Perhaps.   But as Simon Schama demonstrates ably in this account of the French  Revolution, the cry &quot;Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite&quot; so beloved of  the Birkenstock Left first erupted from bloodthirsty mobs calling for their  fellow citizens' heads.  <br />The schoolboy believes the French Revolution  was an inevitable reaction to its American counterpart, and to the  coldheartedness of the French nobility.  The Terror which followed, while  regrettable, was wholly necessary to purge France of its old oppression.   Like so much of history being taught today, this is simplistic tripe.   <br />Schama explains the origins of the Revolution as no other, weaving the  strands of the narrative together into a mighty torrent.  Far from being  unavoidable, the French Revolution was eminently preventable--if only the  King took swift, decisive, and brutal action to deal with the  revolutionaries before the famous Tennis Court Oath, or if he had reined in  his imperial ambitions, or his incompetent ministers who bankrupted the  Empire.  <br />Schama punctures other schoolboy myths. The Bastille, long a  symbol of monarchial tyranny, actually housed only a couple of bewildered  old men, quite surprised at the row made over them.  Queen  Marie-Antoinette, far from being the viper who told starving peasants to  &quot;eat cake&quot; if they could not find bread, went to the guillotine  with a nobility the tyrant Robespierre could not match when his turn came.   And there are countless other surprises in store within these pages.   <br />Schama has an eye for detail.  Were you ever morbid enough to wonder  whether the victims of the guillotine were conscious as their heads were  raised to the cheering throngs?  It's in the book.  Interested in the role  figures of the American Revolution played in the French?  Then you'll  follow Thomas Paine, the Marquis de Lafayette, and others through the  tumult.  <br />Most importantly, you'll understand exactly how the Pandora's  Box opened during the French Revolution drove the rise of fascism and  communism, and why contemporaries the world over viewed it as the signal  event of their time.  <br />If there's one book you read on this fascinating  era, read this one.	2000-02-08

And  like Caesar, Napoleon's moment of triumph was short-lived, although the  Waterloo campaign gave Napoleon the second chance his predecessor could  only dream of.<br />David G. Chandler is that rarest of historians who  combines the dogged research skills of a born academic with the light  writing touch of a master storyteller.  While this work is enormous in both  detail and scope, it is eminently readable, each page filled with the  wonders of the Napoleonic Era.<br />Far from pure biography, Chandler  attempts to unravel the genius of Napoleon and explain the man and his  times in terms even the military layman can understand.  The longevity of  this work (published 1973) attests to the success of this endeavor.<br />This book is an excellent choice for the budding military enthusiast,  the Napoleonic fanatic, or the reader who wishes to begin his introduction  to one of the great captains of history with the finest monograph ever  published on the subject.  Lavishly illustrated with maps, photographs, and  drawings, you'll find The Campaigns of Napoleon to be simply the most  accessible work on on of history's great men.<br />Vive L'Empereur!  Vive  Chandler!	2000-02-08

His previous book &quot;Case Closed&quot;  proved definitively that, Stone's fanciful drivel aside, lone lunatic Lee  Harvey Oswald killed John F. Kennedy, aided only by chance and a U.S.  Marine's sharpshooting skill.  <br />Not one to shy from controversy, Posner  now turns his attention to another 60s hero laid low tragically young by  another assassin's bullet.  Conspiracy theories about MLK's death have long  been fashionable among the African American community; of late even King's  family have bought into the notion that James Earl Ray was innocent.   Posner once again sifts through the facts and speculation and concludes  that Ray was the lone assassin.  <br />In reviewing the case, Posner brings to  light a surprisingly complete picture of the assassin's life.  Ray grew up  in a dirt poor family of criminals and cut his teeth on petty crimes before  settling into his life's calling as a robber.  His increasing tendency  toward violence and continued brushed with the law finally resulted in a  long prison sentence.  Ray escaped prison and set his sights on one more  criminal goal, one guaranteed to make him a hero amongst the  underworld--the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.  <br />Posner takes  the reader through the events of that terrible day in 1968, weaving a  masterful tragedy made more tragic by those unwilling to lay the blame for  this hideous crime where it belongs: squarely on the shoulders of James  Earl Ray.  <br />Posner delivers yet again, and in so doing shines the light  of truth on an incident almost submerged in the murk of paranoia and  denial.  I only hope that Coretta Scott King and the rest of her family  take time to read this book.  While nothing can dim their sorrow, they  could at least gain some measure of comfort in knowing that King's murdererwas brought to justice.	2000-02-02

It was said of Chambers that he  didn't return from Hell empty-handed.  David Horowitz has made the same  journey, and returned to us heavily burdened.  <br />Hating Whitey is a  polemic first and foremost.  Horowitz does not pretend to be a neutral  observer in the Culture War.  Like Chambers, Horowitz is plainly ashamed of  his youthful association with the Left, and like Coleridge's Ancient  Mariner feels condemned to confess his sins to all who come near.  <br />That  there is a sizeable proportion of the Left (black and white) which is  vehemently racist should surprise no one (especially if you've been to one  of our nation's universities).  That the Black Panther movement was nothing  more than a cover for a gang of robbers, rapists, and murderers likewise  should come as no surprise.  <br />What is shocking about this book is the  degree to which those who know better seek to deceive the rest of America.   Horowitz prints a damning letter from a former Black Panther colleague  basically accusing him of murder for allowing a white woman he knew to  audit the Panthers' books, knowing full well that such scrutiny would not  be tolerated.  That a grown man would actually excuse the rape and murder  of a woman to cover up the pillage of organizational coffers is stunning.   Horowitz' response to this incident, as to a number of others covered in  his essays, is one of unbridled outrage.<br />Some readers will take umbrage  at the author's tone.  This is no Firing Line debate, moderated by the  congenial William F. Buckley.  Horowitz came back from Hell not a sadder  and wiser man, as with Chambers, but as a hellfire-and-brimstone pulpit  thumper eager to save souls from the fiery pit whence he came.  It is a  marvelous collection, if not for the faint of heart.	2000-02-01

For those who only know the inimitable Mr. Gaiman from his comic book works,  this collection represents a treasure trove of the author's prose work,  with a generous helping of verse thrown in to boot.<br />The stories contained  within Smoke and Mirrors range from straight horror to wild fantasy.  While  the stories range widely in quality, the 337 pages of this collection fly  by, and even where Gaiman misses the mark, he makes an impression.  <br />I  highly recommend &quot;Murder Mysteries,&quot; a tale of a murder  investigation in Heaven before Lucifer's Fall (or was he pushed?);  &quot;Troll Bridge,&quot; concerning dark happenings beneath a highway  bridge; and &quot;The Price,&quot; a story about a cat's sacrifice which I  believe Mr. King found quite wonderful.  <br />Gaiman thoughtfully includes a  detailed introduction wherein he describes the genesis of these stories.   Fellow writers will find this section fascinating as a window on the  author's creative process.  <br />Short story collections are of necessity a  mixed bag, but even casual Gaiman fans will find Smoke and Mirrors  rewarding.	2000-02-01

Rather than commit an immediate and warranted act of violence to knock some sense into  anyone silly and naive enough to promote such nonsense, give them this  book.<br />The Black Book of Communism lays bare the truth behind this  murderous theology and shows that, contrary to the assertion above,  Communism has left a trail of murder and deceit wherever it has taken root.<br />There are those who claim that Lenin was a great man who simply lost  control of the Revolution he started.  Explain then the numerous examples  of his bloodthirsty orders.  My personal favorite is when he calls for the  hanging of the kulaks in a tone so mild-mannered you'd think he was asking  his babushka to save him some sugar beets.  The banality of evil,  indeed.<br />While a large portion of the book is rightly devoted to the  Bolsheviks (including an amazing account of Russian Civil War atrocities),  you'll also find detailed accounts of Communism in China, Vietnam,  Cambodia, Latin America, and Africa.  This is by far the most comprehensive  and detailed account of Communism's global terror yet produced and  demonstrates conclusively that the Communist ideal IS the problem, not  errors in its execution.<br />Aside from providing numerous, detailed examples  of Communist atrocities, this book raises a number of disturbing questions.  Why do so many persist in following this atheistic religion with such  single-minded fervor, even in the U.S. and Europe?  Why does the West  continue to deny that Communism, not Fascism, is the most murderous  ideology yet created by Man (having caused over 100 million deaths  worldwide, according to the authors)?  Why did it take so long for this  book to be written?<br />Once you crack the cover on this masterful work,  you will be utterly enthralled (and likely outraged) by the unfolding  narrative.  While the book is huge, most readers will find it a quick read  and well worth the time invested. I dare anyone to read this and emerge  with any respect for the Communists or their fellow travellers.  Even the  casual reader will walk away with a deeper appreciation for the suffering  inflicted by this warped creed, as well as sincere gratitude to the men and  women who risked life and liberty to destroy it.he book is huge, most readers will find it a quick read  and well worth the time invested.

US	53036716	R7S1WENUGWUWR	0140440720	437473421	The Twelve Caesars (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	15	19	N	N	Rediscover the Fall of Rome and the Birth of  Historiography	Conventional wisdom holds that historiography began with Tacitus, Herodutus, Thucydides, and Xenephon.  Conventional wisdom is wrong. <br />Suetonius is the father of historians.  While the other four (throw in  Plutarch if you're leery of separating biography from history) certainly  had their place in the creation of the form, it is Suetonius who speaks to  us most clearly as an historian, through the intervening ages.  <br />Why is  this so?<br />Because Suetonius created objective history. Cynics and whiners  hold that history is written by the winning side (thus explaining the  Robert E. Lee hagiographies, I suppose) and therefore reflect a distortion  of reality; yet over a thousand years ago one Roman historian set out (at  some personal risk) to write an objective history of the twelve most  powerful men in the world.  <br />Suetonius had extensive access to Roman  archives and interviewed numerous contemporaries of the Caesars and (where  possible) their descendants.  From this extensive narrative, he chose not  to chronologically lay out their lives, as Plutarch did, but to discourse  on the various characteristics of each ruler.  <br />While the text is  occasionally maddening for drawing no conclusions regarding its subjects,  one cannot doubt that the author is presenting the facts as he gathered  them. Suetonius made a concerted effort not to skew his narrative for or  against its subjects; but rather to present all extant information (some  admittedly outrageous) and allow readers to draw their own conclusions.   The result is the fullest picture of the men who ruled the Roman Empire  ever to emerge.  <br />We owe an enormous debt to Suetonius for his effort.   The historical method (so reviled by partisans of various stripes through  the ages) is as much his invention as the scientific method was Galileo and  da Vinci's.  <br />The Twelve Caesars is a masterful work which belongs in  every library.	2000-01-30
US	53036716	R3CRG4BUXLYIQE	1563894653	728506304	The Sandman Companion	Books	4	23	25	N	Y	A peek behind the curtain and into the world of the Sandman	When Neil Gaiman set down his pen and brought the saga of the Sandman to an end several years ago, it left a huge void in the comics market.  Since the 80s, the trend in comics has been to diminish the role of the writer  and bring the artist to the fore (check out Todd McFarlane's track record  if you don't believe this to be the case.)  Thus most of the comics on the  rack will have gorgeous artwork and incoherent plots, a la The X-Men.  <br />Neil Gaiman fought this inexorable tide almost single-handedly  throughout his run on the Sandman with thought-provoking, intricately  layered tales which simply could not be confined by genre or medium.    <br />The Sandman Companion gives even casual readers a sense of how deep and  how complex Gaiman's stories were and provides a fascinating window on the  comic business and the creative process to boot. <br />Author Hy Bender opens  with background on how Gaiman got his start and how the Sandman came about,  none of which will be very new to those fans who've followed Gaiman's  interviews in fanzines. <br />Then we hit the meat of the book.  Bender takes  us through every Sandman story, providing a detailed synopsis of the plot,  then deconstructing the story with the aid of insightful interviews with  Gaiman and others.  Even those of us familiar with The Annotated Sandman on  the Web will find this fascinating. <br />The collection wraps up with 3  interviews/essays and a detailed list of credits for the original Sandman  comics.<br />Some have criticized DC for trading on the Sandman allure to make  a buck.  (Given the puerile garbage they put out for comics today, who  could blame them?)  The Sandman Companion is no marketing ploy, however. It  is a solid addition to the Gaiman canon and will be a welcome gift for fans  of the author or his immortal creation.	2000-01-22
US	53036716	R34DEVJCM43LOB	0805023968	352900823	Churchill: A Life	Books	5	37	40	N	N	An Indispensable Biography of the Indispensable Man	Throughout the fin-de-siecle excess and Y2K irrationality, the man most often mentioned on the various Man of the Century lists was a paunchy politician who was for most of his career distrusted, despised, and  detested by elites the world over.  He was a Victorian imperialist at the  dawn of the Democratic Age, he opposed women's suffrage with as great a  zeal as the Americans embraced it, he tried to strangle Bolshevism in its  crib just as Europe drew it to its breast and the United States cooed over  it.  Worse yet, he died in 1963, which might as well have been a millenium  ago for our history-challenged populace.<br />How then to explain his appeal?  <br />Simple.  Winston Spencer Churchill saved the world from the twin 20th  century cancers of Communism and Nazism.  <br />Martin Gilbert is the official  biographer of this great man, and as such had access to an unprecedented  collection of material concerning his life. I suggest anyone serious about  his Churchill studies to read the 8-volume biography (and the additional  appendices of correspondence and source material) in its entirety; it will  take some time, but you won't regret a minute of it.  <br />For the rest of  you, this astounding abridgement will do just fine.  How on earth Gilbert  distilled his magesterial biography down into one volume while not turning  it into Cliff's Notes, I don't know; but this book, while large, is  well-written, brisk, and comprehensive in scope.  You'll follow Winston's  path from neglected child to ambitious young adventurer to gifted orator to  brilliant strategist to disgraced politician to indomitable warlord to  elder statesman.  You will learn things about this man you had never  dreamed, and gain new appreciation for the largeness of spirit which  characterized him.  <br />Most of all, you'll realize how rare such a man is,  and how our contemporary heroes pale in comparison to Mr. Churchill.  Man  of the Century?  How about Man of the Milennium?	2000-01-22

The Napoleon of the siege of Toulon merely hinted at the glory to come.  Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus is B-movie theater, especially compared to the majesty of  &quot;Hamlet&quot; or &quot;The Tempest&quot;.  <br />Unfortunately, the same  is true of the man who reinvented the comics medium, Neil Gaiman, late of  Sandman fame.  <br />The stories in this collection show the early evolution  of this great fantasy writer, and those expecting Gaiman at the top of his  game will be disappointed.  <br />&quot;Jack in the Green&quot; is a Swamp  Thing story which comes across as well-meaning fan-fiction.  <br />&quot;Brothers&quot; is a hippy nostalgia trip that reads like an  overlong Allman Brothers jam notable only for Gaiman's unease with DC's  stable of superheroes and his penchant for strip-mining the most obscure  characters.  <br />&quot;Shaggy God Stories&quot; continues in this vein with  another Swamp Thing tale, this one featuring the Floronic Man and a much  more autonomous Gaiman at the helm less beholden to Alan Moore and Rick  Veitch.<br />&quot;Hold Me&quot; is a weak Hellblazer story beautifully  illustrated.  The somber, elegaic mood of the piece will be instantly  familiar to Sandman fans. <br />&quot;Sandman Midnight Theatre,&quot; is a  masterpiece.  Gaiman proves his ability to seamlessly incorporate other DC  characters within his milieu while retaining there inherent  characteristics.  Truly inspired stuff, if you don't mind wading through  the rest.  <br />Essential for Gaiman completists only.	2000-01-16
