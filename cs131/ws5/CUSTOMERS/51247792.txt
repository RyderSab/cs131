Brennan gives a year by year history of each tour, she highlights favorite skaters, talks about unique antics/events that occured with touring, but my favorite is when she gives a blow by blow 24 hour day in the life of the skaters and the Champions on Ice staff.  Marvelous!  Page after page is devoted to setting up of the ice show (they start early in the wee morning hours), problems that occur, and how the skaters spend their time, warm up prior to the show, what they do during the performance.  Lots of pictures of the skaters on and off the ice.  One of the best skating books ever!	2003-01-09

So much research and behind the scenes work went into this beautiful production, this book is certainly worth purchasing.  My only wish would be to have larger pictures of Mr. Darcy!  Maybe a whole chapter of just Mr Darcy pictures!  The chapter in which Mr Firth discusses how he acted in some of the more dramatic scenes was definitely a favorite.  Great book!	2002-07-28

A truly great book--I could hear Peggy's voice in her words as I read each page!  Peggy not only goes through her personal history but the last chapters are devoted to her cancer struggles, and her advice on fitness/health.  She wants to help us all get through our own &quot;long programs&quot; in the healthiest ways possible.  Peggy is very candid and open in her narrative and keeps your interest, even if you don't know much about the sport.  Buy this book!	2002-05-05

Very interesting to read that some as early as 5 years of age  felt uncomfortable with their lifesyle practices.  The hardships  endured to leave the  Amish community are also well described, as the Amish lifestyle does not make it easy to blend into modern &quot; English&quot; sociey ( with only as high as an 8 grade education, no money, only skills are farming/carpentry). Most astounding to me is that some Amish left because of religious disputes, of not being able to worship God freely for the only acceptable bible is the German version which few could read. This is a great book to get a view of the true life of the Amish rather than the  romanticized slant.	2000-11-11

I have read numerous books on the Kennedy family, and this biography tells the Kennedy story best.  I was, however, disappointed  there was not more on his wife,  Carolyn or her sister Lauren since the title encompassed their death, also.  I truly feel anyone reading this book will get a true picture of the man JFK, Jr. was, from premature birth to death.	2000-09-29

As Kim tells her life's story she talks about how she has been able to survive the pressures and stress put upon her as a model, a wife and a  mother in a crazy immoral world.  This book carries Christian themes since   religion is her major lifeline, faith is what keeps her strong.  In reading  this book one feels if Kim can  be a morally strong and physically healthy  person I can too.  Kim shows us the way.  This book is more than a beauty  book, it is about being whole from the inside out.  If you are looking for  a book on beauty tips this is not the book for you, however if you want to  live a healthier, happier more fulfiling  life Kim tells you how and gives  numerous examples of how she accomplished it..	2000-06-13

This book is a must for any fan of G&amp;G (Gordeeva and Grinkov) and any lover of ice skating.  Ekaterina lovingly  tells her story of how they met, trained together, and  fell in love.  She also gives one a good idea of what life is like for an  athlete in the Soviet Union.  A touching love story.....I only hope someday  she chooses to write a sequel about her struggles and ultimate triumphs  since that sad day so long ago when Sergei breathed his last.	2000-06-04

A must read!	Joan Collins does a spendid job of interviewing her famous friends and gets down to the nitty gritty!  She asks them about diet, excersize,style,beauty tips, and  mental attitude regarding aging.  One  really gets insight and  lots of motivation on how these gorgeous women  stay so beautiful.  Some tips are even bizarre-Jerry Hall rarely washes her  gorgeous hair and uses mink oil to moisturize it.  Bo Derek confesses how  sorry she is having been a sun bather and the consequences she is facing.   Wonderful full page photos in color complete this great book.  If you are  an over 40 female I highly recommend it!	2000-05-01

This is a very shallow book about Cybill's life.  She tells all about her numerous, and I mean numerous affairs--Elvis doesn't care for oral sex, she engaged in a threesome with a stuntman,so on and so forth.  Cybill  constantly reminds the reader of her beauty, a picture of her and former  lover Bogdonavich is quoted &quot;We're Peter and Cybill and you  aren't&quot;.  Bruce Willis comments to her that he can't say his lines  because she is so beautiful.  And she feels that only God could love her  for qualities other than her blondeness.  Enough already-we all know you  are beautiful Cybill.  Cybill doesn't seem to grow much intellectaully with  age through the book, but I guess she figures with her beauty... Buy this  book if A) you want to read what makes her tick (her beauty and sexual  relationships)  B)  You are interested in a sleezy, careless sexual  lifestyle  C)  You need to be reminded that she is beautiful	2000-04-21

A well written book about Hillary and Bill which makes one wonder---How did Bill Clinton ever become president?   If all that is written about him in this book is true, how did the people of Arkansas let all the  womanizing and scandals disappear?  It also still leaves me wondering why  an INTELLIGENT  woman would stay with a philandering man who embarrasses  her continually?   Going for the senate is great but not worth giving up  your self respect.  I had to read this book in small doses, it  amazed/sickened me so when it came to their political life.	2000-03-03

Scott gives the insiders  view to training for the Olympics and the politics of skating.  He also  devotes a touching chapter to Sergei Grinkov and Katia Gordeeva the former  pairs skaters (Sergei died unexpectedly from heart problems, leaving his  partner in skating/wife Katia and their young daughter.)

Very descriptive, graphic, tells all about the horrific treatment he, his father and many others endured.  What surprised me most  about this book is the human qualities of denial  (in the beginning), and  optimism (throughout imprisonment) these people had,  and  strong faith,  such as debating about whether to fast on holy days, since they are  literally starving to death on the few morsals they are given.  Night  will  have an effect on your life, the images the author describes are hard to  erase.  Made a BIGGER IMPRESSION than DIARY OF ANNE FRANK and SCHINDLER'S  LIST.  READ NIGHT!!!!!	1999-10-17

Lady Campbell digs up lots of dirt on the Princess regarding  lovers, her extravagant lifestyle, her &quot;mental  illness&quot;(who wouldn't be mentally ill having to deal with all the  pressures Diana faced - and with zero support), and goes into great detail  on the last few weeks of Diana's life.  Many of the sources are anonymous -  others are various royals, palace workers, family friends. A great deal of   information came from Lady Colin's conversations with the Princess herself.   This book looks at all sides of the Princess - the good and especially the  bad.  For a more &quot; fairy-tale&quot; one sided view of Diana read  Andrew Morton's book.  Lady Colin Campbell  at times seems to despise  and/or is immensely jealous of Diana, and often comes to the defense of  Prince Charles instead of seeing  Diana's view.  For example, the author  could not understand why Diana was upset that Charles wanted to say  goodbye, prior to his marriage, to Camilla face to face.  The author felt  this was a&quot;gentlemanly&quot; thing to do, and felt  Diana was being  immature . I would recommend reading this book to any avid Diana readers  (after reading Morton's book) to help get the big picture of Diana's life  and how  her peers viewed her	1999-09-07
