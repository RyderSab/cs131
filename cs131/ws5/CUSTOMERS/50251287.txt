Up till that point the author writes a endearing, mature romance about two older (30's) characters who've been hurt by past loves and are realistically flawed because of it. The author then goes a bit wanky with her writing-having both the hero and heroine behaving so outlandishly you'll be wondering if you're reading the same book:)<br /><br />The book does have a happy ending-and the writing is at least above average. The love scenes are mild, to moderately erotic at the end.The hero, Simon, a man who was entrenched in  women's rights issues-a hero before his time, and a true romantic-ya gotta love him!<br /><br />Overall, a pleasant read and I'll be trying more of this author's books. 4 stars!	2005-10-09

Seducing Mr. Heywood certainly fits that bill. Unlike most regencies-where the man is the rake,notorious and experienced-in this regency the lady-thrice married and quite a beau monde scandal maker-is the much more experienced of the two. I loved the fact that the hero is a bit younger, fresh faced and never married VICAR!<br /><br />The book is well written and fast paced-the author was able to turn, what at first glace,a  very unlikable heroine into a wonderful character by novels end. The author fits many funny and interesting characters into this short,fun and flirty novel. This book is quite sexy by most regency standards-while not explicit-you'll find yourself rooting for both characters-that they find their love-and make love as well:)<br /><br />I thoughly enjoyed this fresh new look at regency romance!<br /><br />5 stars:)	2005-09-18

A truer phrase was never spoken! This is the first in an intriguing new futuristic series written by several authors.<br /><br />This book is part action, part sci-fi, time travel (in cryo sleep but she still finds herself in the future), and finally part romance. The romance and love story play very little in this book-but it doesn't lag from that, in fact it makes, IMO, a more enjoyable read. Banzai is a truely heroic female-she takes the initiative-no whiney, TSTL heroine here!:) The male leads are equally stong and capable-and super fine-always a crowd pleaser:). As someone who grew up on sci-fi and action movies I really enjoyed this book. Very fast paced-especially towards the end-I can see this being made into a movie.<br /><br />The only forwarning you may need is this series is written in \\"installment\\" format. While you COULD read a particular book alone I don't think you'll get as much out of it if you do not continue with the other books in the series-for example, there is a \\"happy ending\\" here but you are left with a cliff hanger type ending that pretty much insures you'll want to read the other four books-a very clever marketing ploy on Zebra's part:)<br /><br />If you're looking for a traditional romance book-then this isn't it. But if you like to try new styles of books and are open to a lot of action with minor romance-then I recommend this book to you:)<br /><br />4.5 stars!	2005-08-26

I had been hearing great reviews on many paranormal romance boards I go on about this series of books. I picked up the first, and my husband, who is NO romance reader, thought it looked interesting so he read it first. He loved it and so we bought all of the current books.<br /><br />I thought the first was great but the second is even better. It gets into more detail of the lifestyle of the now publicly known vampires-who are legal-but who must now follow certain laws in our society.<br /><br />As a southerner-I love these books. I like the fact that were not all portayed as rich, but redneck. Sookie-the main character-is a working stiff like the rest of us. What's different about Sookie is she is a telepath. Ms Harris writes about all the pros and cons of that gift with a lot of class and fun. I would never want to \\"read minds\\" after reading about some truly awful and embarrassing things Sookie sees in peoples thoughts.<br /><br />The vampires are uniquely written-the main vampires in this book are average joes-who, besiding drinking blood, of course-like some of the things we all do-fast cars, traveling, making love-and Bill's favorite-the internet:)<br /><br />Ms Harris introduces a few new characters that we'll hopefully see in future books, as well as going more into existing characters, and introducing more conflict into the love triangle of Sookie, Bill, and Eric-as well, as Sam, the shapeshifter. Shapeshifters-another supernatural, but underground class, are featured heavily in this short, fast paced and fun book.<br /><br />Violence is mild to medium, sex is much more predominant in this book, as well as the idea of a \\"religious right\\" who hate vampires. If any of these things are sensitive to you, then you may want to skip it. Otherwise 5 stars!	2005-08-21

Filled with dozens of animals, people, even structures-built entirely from shells! You will see many shell deesigns that you have never seen in other shell craft books.<br /><br />The book has great pictures and tells exactly what shells you need for each critter. But you can substitute-and you will have to on certain things-for example, the author uses wentletraps-very rare and expensive in the states, so you will have to substitute something more common for those.<br /><br />I like the fact that the author doesn't use \\"google eyes\\" on her creations-which, in my opinion always detract from the creation-but you can easily add these if you like them. Anyone would like to receive one of these great little shell creations as a gift.<br /><br />My only \\"needs improvement\\" would be on the explaination and suggestions for glue. The author suggests generic \\"strong glue\\"-but most folks, especially children, will get frustrated when the shell critters fall apart before fully dry. My suggestion-strong, fast grip silicone caulking glue for kids use, or a hot glue gun for adult use.<br /><br />Otherwise, 5 stars!	2005-08-02

The author has clear photos of many common shells, as well as where in the US you would find them, as well as an approximate monatery value (which may be a bit higher as this book is a decade + old, but seems pretty accurate).<br /><br />My eight year old son, who is a budding conchologist, loves to look through this book-and can now identify several shells from it. I refer to it quite a bit as well.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend to a more advanced collector as it is too basic for that. Also, as to the \\"shelling\\" aspect-the book gives you no more hints or tips to shell collecting than any other shell book.<br /><br />Overall-a great basic guide-and you can get it dirt cheap here on Amazon (used)!<br /><br />4.5 stars!	2005-07-24

It does cover lot's of shells found in Texas. It gives good scientific info as to each shells class and family.<br /><br />My main areas that I was disappointed were:<br /><br />1-the regions (city, county, beach) etc was NOT specific enough, as well as what would be the best time of the year of what region is best to find each shell.<br /><br />2-no color photos! In my opinion-very important for different shell identifaction.<br /><br />3-I was also surprised there was no section that gave an indepth guide to areas of high shell concentrations-where to find shells and when's the best time of the year to go look.<br /><br />this is my only specifically Texas shell id book-but I have the idea that there are probably better ones out there. It may be that it's just an older book.<br /><br />OK for the price (used here on Amazon) and a good \\"jumping off point\\" for Texas shell id. I will be looking for more, possibly better books though.<br /><br />4 stars.	2005-07-24

I would recommend it as a book for a child just getting into nature-birdwatching, rocks,trees and seeds, etc. It gives you basic info on several common \\"natural\\" things found in the US.<br /><br />The book has it's good and bad points. While it covers lots of different areas-what it does cover is VERY basic-kind of like a starting point in several natural fields. The drawings are OK-but to be honest they are not clear enough for proper id of many things-for example, several of the seed id's-even I as an adult couldn't tell one from the other. I think either better art or photos would have been more appropriate in this type of book.<br /><br />The age range suggested is 7 to 10. My 8 year old son did skim through it, but nothing really seemed to grab him. He's pretty \\"into\\" all things nature, and has many field guides-so-a child just starting out might appreciate it more.<br /><br />The craft aspect I give 0 stars-as the projects are few, and VERY simplistic and barely explained-very poor- do not buy if you are looking for nature crafts:(<br /><br />Overall, I'd suggest it for a young 6-8 aspiring naturalist-if you buy it used-I wouldn't suggest paying full price as it's honestly pretty run of the mill.<br /><br />3 stars.	2005-07-24

Has several different sections regarding various natural materials. Shells, feathers, leaves, pods, etc. This books is basically about different home decor items with a \\"natural\\" slant. You find your standard wreaths, flower pots, frames, topiaries, etc-but shows how to cover them with various natural materials.<br /><br />The projects all look top quality-you'd be happy to display as home decor without worrying if they looked \\"hokey\\"-but all these projects have been covered in many other craft books over the years-nothing seemed new or innovative. The directions are BASIC-pretty much written with few step by step instructions-a novice crafter may not understand the directions.<br /><br />Overall, beautiful \\"eye candy\\" for seasoned crafters looking for inspiration for \\"flower arrangement\\" type crafts. I'd suggest you buy used.<br /><br />3.5 stars.	2005-07-24

The author does talk about her making of shell colleges, BUT this book is not a craft book. It's a sweet story on the author's fascination with shells. She gives insight to the history of certain shells. The book is mostly about her love of nature.<br /><br />If you like to read books about naturalists, then you'd enjoy this book. But if you're looking to advance your education of shells-there is much better books out there for that.<br /><br />3 stars.	2005-07-21

That is misleading, and if you buy it for that reason you will be dissappointed. The author does include a few blurbs about shell crafts and recipes. BUT, the vast majority of the book is a mid size, watercolor art book of various shells the author admires. The art work is lovely, and would be appreciated by a shell collector-but as pretty as the book is-content wise it's not more than just \\"eye candy\\".<br /><br />So, if you're looking for shell crafts, education, or a shell guide-I'd say skip it.

While it doesn't have the big color pictures like most new books-it does have good black and white pics and lot's of ideas. I especially like the way the book shows various rock artists work-then shows how to make something similar yourself.<br /><br />The ideas are a bit dated-ala funky 70's styles-but they are fun and playful-and vintage is in of course.

I actually bought this book for myself-to learn to make critters out of shells and to read to/teach that to my 8 year old son. It has several good \\"sea critters\\" pictured that I haven't seen in other books. But the directions on how to step by step MAKE these critters is pretty much non exisistant.<br /><br />For example-on one page the author talks about using your critters in a sea scene or diorama-but all the \\"directions\\" is one picture of finished critters, foam, and cover! I feel this would frustrate children wanting to make these critters, but not knowing how.<br /><br />Overall, I'd suggest either buying this book used at a much lower rate, or checking out from the library-but I sadly wouldn't recommend dropping 15 bucks on it new-as it's pretty much a picture book with no instructions-but will give you ideas to make sea shell critters	2005-07-12

What it DOES have is instructions on making sea shell flowers, shell flower pictures, colleges, shell flower jewelry and mosaics.<br /><br />There are good drawings that explain how to assemble the items, and what shells to use to make each different flower.<br /><br />After buying several newer shell craft books that were more \\"eye candy\\" than instructional, I was pleased with this books directions.

Here's why:<br /><br />Clear,concise directions with good pictures-most projects could be done by a beginner but there are also MANY projects to make a more advanced artist happy.<br /><br />Great variation of mosaics-this author covers some mosaics styles I've never seen in other books. Like making your own wire mesh base for cool animal mosaic sculptures-with enough how to pictures that even I can contemplate making one:), making several different shaped stepping stones-from scratch-these are GREAT-there are footprints and fish to die for. And unusual mosaic creations like windchimes and garden \\"cones\\".<br /><br />This book helps you to think outside the box and many of these projects would look wonderful outside or inside as well.

On some mixed breeds if I can rule in favor of the dog being part of a certain breed-that may greatly help it's chances for adoption-so I'm always on the lookout for clear, concise new breed info. The breed listings in this book are exceptional-with interesting history of the breed, physical characteristics, and lovely, helpful color drawings of each breed. Since this book was written overseas-you'll find many rare (to US folks) breeds listed that are very interesting to learn about.<br /><br />The other sections of the book deal with the history of dogs, dog care and dog health are pretty standard for a dog reference book-handy but not specialized. If you are someone who keeps a \\"library\\" of dog breed books on hand then I'd recommend adding this one to your collection.<br /><br />4 stars:)	2005-07-01

Being thrust into marriage they learn about each other, about what love really is, and that they truly are meant to be together.<br /><br />Unlike the other reviewers, I enjoyed the mystery in the story, especially since Anne was able to help solve it.<br /><br />Those of you who like traditional regencies, and who may be offended by LOTS of fairly graphic love scenes should skip this one as it is very erotic and explicit.<br /><br />Ms. Jewel is a great new, talented writer and for a first novel it was excellent. Like another review, I also felt that if there had been more characterization and interaction between the two characters and a few less sex scenes than this book would rate a 5.<br /><br />Otherwise a spicy glimpse into Regency life, fun and enjoyable. 4 stars!	2005-05-31

She's sitting there, supposedly afraid of what he'll do to her, but \\"strangely attracted\\"-UGH! What a waste of time-there are MANY more, better, thought provoking and uplifting romances than this.<br /><br />I guess my main problem with this book was that both characters are completely without morals and just basically unpleasant and unlikeable.

Don't get me wrong-I love the \\"reformed rake\\" storyline-but these two didn't  seem like they wanted reforming, they enjoyed their crimes too much:(<br /><br />I was hoping that it was just this particular Ivory book, but alas, I tried \\"Beast\\" by the same author next and was equally dissappointed.

But, these characters have NO positive aspects, no moral or ethical views, that would redeem or uplift them in the course of the book. Very one dimensional.<br /><br /> For example-how many romances have the heroine, while on a ship to meet their fiance, start a clandestine affair-this mystery \\"lover\\" happens to be the selfsame fiance who is angry over hearing the heroine badmouth him before they even met-so he basically cons her and has sex with her as another man?? This is supposed to be romance???<br /><br />The heroine is an absolute brat and spouts hateful, vindictive things to the hero-who still adores her!??!<br /><br />There is quite a bit of \\"submission and domination\\" in the sex scenes-getting tied up, bent over, etc...also not my cup of tea-be forewarned.<br /><br />Throughly unpleasant book-NO stars and NO recommendation!	2005-05-23

If I was specifically judging it on continuity, plot holes and such, I'd give it a 1 because the storyline does have some big plot holes, info just left out, no explaintion of how or why the characters have these mystical abilities, and what explaination given was hard to follow.<br /><br />If you are looking for galas, and balls, the fun of the regency era thru the \\"ton\\"-you won't find it here.

I felt there was so MUCH mundane writing and hardly any dialog between not only the two main characters but between any characters at all.

I read quite a few books recently that start with promise and quickly go downhill-this book is just the opposite. I felt it started a bit slow but became very good as it progressed. I disagree with the other reviewers thought's on the heroine. I believe she was always a sweet person, but was just behaving angrily because she had literally saved the hero's life, and hid him away from possible arrest but he refused to confide in her! He kissed her in public, which in regency times, could mean \\"ruin\\" for a unwed maiden-so all in all, she had REASONS to be angry, and if you read the story correctly, you can see that she never really stopped caring for, or believing in, the hero.<br /><br />I enjoyed the \\"country\\" regency aspect of this novel-this novel was more picnics, teas, and festivals than the glitter of the ton. The cute cast of Laura's pets were a nice touch.<br /><br />Not the best novel-but far from the worst. A cute regency read. 4 stars!	2005-05-05

Darcy tries to maintain some semblance of a regular life but also runs a \\"underground railroad\\" of sorts for other abused woman.<br /><br />All in all, a good action book-I would have given it five stars except the romance, in my opinion, could have been better, and the heroine was a bit aggrevating with her die hard reluctance to getting the police involved-even though big time crimes were being committed.<br /><br />I'd recommend this short, exciting read to romance fans who like tough, take charge female leads, and equally tough heroes. 4 stars.	2005-05-03

This is also the last book in the \\"lessons of love\\" trilogy but I throughly enjoyed it without having read the other two first. The hero, Robert Carroway, steals the show in this powerful tale of loss and love. Lucinda is portrayed as just the right mix of serenity and fun loving to shake Roberts's tortured life up and make him realize his life is worth living and not hidden away from society.<br /><br />This author is very good about introducing and portaying many fun and interesting secondary characters. I also thought the idea of introducing what was either panic attacks, post tramatic stress disorder, or both into a historical a brilliant idea. The love scenes are slightly sensual-nothing too racy to offend readers of straight romance.  A tender albeit a bit melancholy regency romance-4.5 stars!	2005-05-01

While I'm not as big a fan on comptemporary romance-I was pleased with this exceptionally fun, and surprisingly erotic, book.<br /><br /> The heroine, Emma, is a animal behaviorist. With my background in animal welfare, I thought her character was portrayed accurately but not so much so that it would be boring to the novice. Thomas, the hero, was a great,hunky, morose character that was a bit uptight and needed the love of a family and good woman more than he realized. I was pleased with the fact that the characters were more mature than most 20 something romance characters-AND they were portayed as still wanting to get-it-on!<br /><br />The sex scenes are VERY hot, but also downright funny-the dialog is great, and the various animals, especially Hairy, steal the show. If you enjoy funny and spicy contemporary romance with real, working class characters (no millionares here), then I think you'll enjoy this book-4.5 stars!	2005-04-27

The heroine-a half white, half gypsy, Liza is a stong character whose faced adversity in her life but doesn't let it get her down-she always lived as Romany before the fateful day she comes to town to sell baskets, and her adventure begins there.<br /><br />The hero is a self made railroad man, Reese-a friendly workaholic who is about to pop the question to the \\"perfect\\" but cold Rebecca Ann, before he meets the \\"imperfect\\" but loving Liza. The way the story is written from Liza's \\"fish out of water\\" perspective is fun and fresh.<br /><br />Lot's of gypsy/Romany lore and tidbits-whether they are historically accurate, I don't know but they make the book very interesting. The books sidebar of overcoming prejudice is well done and the secondary characters are as well. The romance scenes are slightly sensual but not over done for those who don't do racy reads. The beautiful cover art by John Ennis is icing on the cake!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more from this author-5 stars!	2005-04-26

We all thought the book funny and sad as well. Mr Stink is a fun character for young boys, especially those with a interest in spy's like James Bond. Some younger children may not get some of the main character's brit speak, so this is a good book to read aloud and explain to them.<br /><br />I would recommend this novel as a fun adventure book for young kids-but, as a personal aside, I didn't like the  high amount of animal ignorance and neglect that goes on in this book.<br /><br />For Example- The family adopts stink from a shelter, they own a pet store, but seem to have no knowledge of cat care. They lock him up in the basement as soon as he gets home, the little sister corners Stink, torments him, trying to put doll clothes on him, and poor Stink, defending himself, scratches her, and the dad immediately says declaw him, the mom wants to get rid of him, a neighbor's dog is starving cause other animal's are eating his food but no human seems to notice, etc...I could go on and on...is this a good message to be sending to young kids about responsible/compassionate pet ownership? But this is a good way to begin a dialog of discussion with your child about being humane towards animals.<br /><br />We'll try the others but if more of the same goes on in the next installment we won't be reading the others. 3 stars.	2005-04-26

The chemistry was excellent betwwen the characters, with enough interesting secondary characters and villians, adventure, laugh out loud humor, and quite spicy love scenes to make for an entertaining fast (315 page)book.

This vampire romance is set with a dark, brooding vamp who was \\"made\\" against his will and he does not really want to be a vampire. I also liked the fact that it's clear early on that the two main characters are in love-but she doesn't want to become a vamp, and he doesn't want to turn her into one either.<br /><br />You'll find yourself rooting for the couple and I enjoyed the happy, albeit inplausible, ending.

There is little, if any romantic scenes, NO love scenes, and no passion at all. This book is a book about a marriage of convienence, a ill bred albeit wealthy woman and a titled but poor man. IMO, his family behaves terribly to Susannah after she saves their lousy hides, they have no problem of pointing out that she is base born while happily spending her money. The husband acts not much better.<br /><br />While this behavior is certainly more accurate than most passionate regencies I'm used to-I guess I'd rather enjoy the fiction than be perturbed by reality. If you are looking for passionate, romantic, chivalry, then skip this book-2 stars.	2005-04-18

I had heard many good reviews about the Cynster series, and that this particular one is a prequel of sorts to the others, so start with this one. Sadly I was not impressed.<br /><br />I quit this book about 100 pages in. The story began on a interesting note, but went downhill fast.<br /><br />Unlike the other reviewer, I disliked these characters, the hero in particular, because of the under current of manipulation of the heroine, not voicing his feelings but instead assuming the \\"you will be mine whether you like it or not\\". That kind of arrogance is not my personal cup of tea.<br /><br />Stephanie Laurens writing style isn't bad, but didn't particularly grab me either.But I'm withholding any judgement and will try other books by her again.<br /><br />BTW-A little pet peeve of mine that I noticed in this book-the hero kept calling the heroine a pet name-mignonne. Once or twice is cute-but it was WAY overused-about 40 times in 100 pages! I would be ready to throttle my lover if they kept that up:)-<br /><br />If you like arrogant hero's-try it you may like it. I'm more into the tortured hero or fun loving rake. I'd give what I did read 2 stars.	2005-04-06

This particular romance, is a ghost story, but unlike any I've read so far. The setting, an Antebellum house, a confederate soldier and a modern day widow looking for closure to her husbands death  was a very good romantic suspense book. While this book's \\"ghostly\\" overtones may not be enough for some paranormal purists, I think those who truly like a well written, entertaining read will quite enjoy it.<br /><br />The most surprising aspect of this book was the \\"unhappy\\" end, though much more feasible to the storyline.

The book actually had a plot-unlike some regencies which are a series of event goings thrown in with a few love scenes. The hero and heroine are older, realistic characters-no gorgeous 19 year old virgins here. I liked the fact that the heroine takes control of her life instead of wallowing in self pity after she's abandoned by the hero years earlier-in fact she becomes an accomplished business woman.<br /><br />The storyline of finding the golden leopard was exciting, the sub characters-assasins from India-are interesting and add to the exotic flavor of the book and the love scenes are very sensual and erotic-unusual for a regency romance. If you love regencies but are looking for a bit more adventuresome plot, then I recommend this book-4 1/2 stars!	2005-03-26

I just want to add that this book exceeded my expectactions on several accounts<br /><br />First-for a relatively short (250 pages) Harlequin type book I felt the story much more involved.<br /><br />Second-this was a surprising series regency, IMO, in the fact that there are a fair amount of involved \\"love\\" scenes here-ie-sex. All done tastefully, but sensually. I also thought the heroine's affection for her husband, including wanting to be near him by being intimate, refreshing and realistic.<br /><br />I liked both characters and I would recommend this book for those who want a regency that's a bit out of the norm. 4 stars	2005-03-11

It just doesn't grab you. The story-the heroine being forced into a search mission by the hero-an unscrupulous businessman-uninteresting, and not inducable to wanting to continue the story.<br /><br />The hero is your typical hero for some romances-tough, self made millionaire-but this guy is a user, and will use any means necessary to get what he wants-not a high recomendation for a romantic hero.<br /><br />the heroine is bland and one dimensionable-and that's saying something for a modern heroine that is a search dog rescuer for the ATF! Her \\"psychic\\" connection is a bit far fetched the way it's written.<br /><br />The biggest miss was the dialog-flat and dull. The interplay is very repetitive and simplistic.<br /><br />1 star and hopefully another Johanson will be better.	2005-02-22

The main problem was the lack of chemistry and not enough indication that these two characters were falling for each other, and too much barb throwing and battling betwwen the two.<br /><br />I feel if the author would have got the issue of Miss Verey not wedding the hero's brother, as well as get the romance between the hero/heroine underway sooner, than it would have been a better book.	2005-02-16

Miss Bonander handles the subject-mental illness-with class and sensitivity. The book is very emotionally gripping. You'll find yourself rooting for the hero and heroine-who have both faced abuse in their lifetimes but have not allowed it to make them failures. The book is great because it shows a mixed race character that is a sucessful man despite his harsh treatment early in life.<br /><br />Very sensual lovescenes throughout the book and the author ingeniously deals with the heroines naivety with style and a lot of fun.

I throughly enjoyed this book and finished it in a day. While some may see the plots and characters \\"formulaic\\", heck, they work-and I might add,similar plotlines have worked for some of bestselling romance writers as well for years. \\"If it ain't broke why fix it?\\"<br /><br />Logan is a great \\"tortured\\" hero. 30, been around the block and then some with many lovers, but had only one \\"true\\"love that betrayed him. Madeline is the perfect yin to his yang. Sweet, full of love and patience, but still a strong woman. Unlike others, I found it likable that here is a regency heroine who refused to sit back and be betrothed to a truly horrid person just because it's the \\"right\\" thing for her parents interests. She was willing to accept whatever fate her actions caused, and that would have been huge in those days.<br /><br />It was refreshing to see characters, hero & heroine both, who were basically abused growing up (he was physically, she was neglected/emotionally put down) that went on with their lives and became productive members of society rather than let their misfortune make then abusive themselves. The sub-plot dealing with these issues were very engrossing to read.<br /><br />The playhouse storyline was refreshing as most regencies deal strictly with the \\"ton\\", so this was a unique change of pace. This book struck me as similar in chemistry and plot movement to some other well known authors like Johanna Lindsey and Amanda Quick. I think Miss Kleypas has a long and illustrious career ahead of her and will in time become as popular as some of these authors if not more.<br /><br />The love scenes are highly sensual-I found nothing \\"icky\\" about the fact that she was 18 and he 30-hell, the man her parents wanted her for was probably at least 50, so what's the big deal? Marriages with this age difference were common in this time period, so I didn't find it implausible in the least.<br /><br />Highly entertaining, highly recommended 5 stars!	2005-02-12

This romance is unusual because it begins ten years after the hero and heroine break up after a tragedy befalls the heroines brother-and she blames the hero for his death. She moves back to the small town, to take the place of her father-the city's doctor. A accident happens-this romance turns into a semi mystery.<br /><br />Some sensuality, but quite formulaic in the lovers \\"battle\\" to not fall in love again. I'd say this romance was better than average but not much. There's nothing that makes it stand out from similar books. I would give it an award for a beautiful cover but horrible title. I'd say buy if you can get it used, otherwise skip it. 3.5 stars.	2005-02-10

Almost against my better judgement.<br /><br />In my opinion, it would have been a five star book WITHOUT some of the graphic submissive/dominant sex scenes. I'm no prude, I read erotic romance, but truthfully several scenes were not remotely necessary, and were downright pornographic.<br /><br />They didn't make sense in this storyline-they are tracking a serial killer who brutalizes women viciously-then the heroine rushes off to have blantantly submissive sex with the hero??? Getting tied up features prominently in this book-not my thing personally.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong-Angela Knight is a good writer. I think she'll go far in romance, if her stories feature more mainstream erotica and more time devoted to the actual romance. Here's a hint-a dozen kinky interludes, with the last 50 pages saying \\"I think I love you\\" doesn't constitute a romance. That's just erotica, or possibly pornography, depending on your point of view.<br /><br />If you look at the futuristic element to the romance-very convoluted, highly inplausible, but somehow strangely enjoyable. This is a hard book to pinpoint good or bad.<br /><br />Be forewarned-if you cannot stomach GRAPHIC sex scenes and language, skip this book.Otherwise, 3.899 stars:)	2005-01-27

But I haven't read that one first and still found Dryden's Bride enjoyable on it's own merit. The book has all the elements of classic Medievel romance-tortured hero, downtrodden but spunky heroine, truly evil villian. The theme of the book is how the two main characters have a flawed sense on how others perceive and value them. Having the love of the other opens their eyes that they are truly worthy and worthy of love and family.<br /><br />While I understand another's reviewers comment about historical accuracy-I do feel that this IS a work of fiction, a romance, and therefore the author should be given a little leeway about historical accuracy. It's supposed to be entertainment, light reading-don't overanalyze it folks:)<br /><br />Great escapist weekend reading-4 stars****	2005-01-25

The book lags a bit in the middle, but was interesting enough at the beginning that I hung around to see how the book ended. It did pick up at the end. My only complaint, though not really a complaint, is that there is almost no intimacy or passion between the couple. There was no \\"umph\\" between the characters-they just seemed to \\"admire\\" each other greatly.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for fans of historical romance with very light love scenes. If you like a spicier romance, then look to another book. 3.5 stars.	2005-01-24

The hero was a musical genius, the plotline where he is playing \\"twin\\" brothers a unique touch. The story was a bit moody and dramatic, but in a good way. The heroine was a forward thinking lady who was a gossip columnist. Sensual romantic elements. Like the other reviewer, I am also happily surprised at the quality of some of the Harlequin Historicals, like this one. I look forward to reading more by Miss Stone. 5 stars!	2005-01-24

Agnes is a wonderfully unconventional historical heroine. Brave, intelligent and beautiful-she's a bodyguard-and Miss Lamb's skillful, fun writing carries that, at first implausible, lady's occupation off. Her hero is equally a bold character as he is a studious, intelligent inventor of textiles. A truly enjoyable read. 5 stars!	2005-01-20

Betrayed is one of the MacKenzie family series-and,while in my opinion, not the best (so far that's Beguiled, for me), it's still excellent. This family is free spirited, unconventional, and they protect their own. I think you'll love these four sisters, their Rogue of a father, and the strong heros they fall for. 4 stars!	2005-01-20

If you've read and enjoyed the other books in this series, especially Beguiled, Agne's story, then you owe it to yourself to pick up True Heart and find out what happened to Virginia.<br /><br />Fans of Scottish Historicals should seek out Miss Lamb's books as they are older but better than some current novels out there. 5 stars!	2005-01-20

Not true for this book. The story is very enjoyable to read. Two unusual, independant characters who realize that in life, we all need family. What starts as sexual attraction becomes a deeper need to be together and to share their lives. This is one of a series of books, The Tallchiefs-a family whose ancestors are both Indian and Scottish-a interesting combo. After reading this one-I'll now find and read the others in this series, as I want to read more about this fun, loving family. I highly recommend this book.	2005-01-13

Like one of the other reviewers I'm ambivalant about this book. It started, in my opinion, with a bang-there was a lot of promise in the characters presented. I guess the main problem was the somewhat dreariness of the characters as the book progresses, or possibly, that because the story is set literally weeks after the hero's sister is found dead, there was a feeling of morose over the whole book/romance. Heck, even the hero thinks to himself-\\"I'm here to solve my sisters death, not fall in love\\". No joy could be taken (and rightly so) in any activity without the thought of the sisters death in the background.<br /><br />The writing is enjoyable, and in no way should Miss Ashworth be discounted as a writer. I think it was the theme of the book that I didn't enjoy. As I found I could only read this book in about 10 page increments before I'd lose interest, I gave up after halfway through. It may just be me-try the book and see for yourself.	2005-01-12

While the writing is good, I just couldn't \\"root\\" for these characters. I think the main problem is that the hero, is a known rake and womanizer-but no reasoning behind his actions, as well as no redeeming features about him surfaced early enough in the story to \\"win me over\\" to liking the characters.<br /><br />The heroine is likable enough-but does several stupid, and possibly dangerous stunts, that make her a little TSTL. If you enjoy rakes then this may be a book that is more your taste.	2005-01-05

This is the first book I've read from this author, and I plan on reading her other books after this. Miss Kingston has a true talent for evoking the regency period and spinning a heartfelt, emotional tale. The hero is a gallant officer, one of a group of British heroes called the \\"Lucky 7\\".<br /><br />He sustains a wound to his arm that paralyzes it, and unfortunately, paralyzes any zest he has for life. Until a fateful meeting with a beautiful, though not uncourageous, damsel in distress. Through Alissa and her family, the hero finds that life is truly worth living.<br /><br />Well thought out dialogue, a more mature aspect to this period (no flighty teenage hoydens here), and gently written but thought provoking love scenes make this an enjoyable book. I'd give this book 4 and 3/4 stars instead of 5 simply because the villianous uncle should have been made to meet his maker but receives a punishment much too nice for him, IMO.  Otherwise 5 stars!	2005-01-03

From the back blurb you are lead to believe that a large part of the book is set on the Titanic-which I'm not interested in. I almost didn't buy it for that reason but I'm glad I changed my mind. The only part that deals with the Titanic is the first few pages-to set up the relationship of the characters.<br /><br />What you then have is a delightful new romance set in San Francisco in the 1910's. For those looking for strong, intelligent heroines, Loretta is a near perfect example. Loratta is a wealthy lady of 28 (a spinster:), who is a true follower of the burgeoning feminist movement. She was considered a \\"bohemian\\" for her beliefs, intellectual aquaintences, and philanthopical efforts. But she's not a \\"perfect\\" character-her faults-speaking whatever's on her mind, all the time, ability to get her friends into her fiascos, etc-just make her more endearing as a heroine. And all us + size ladies rejoice-Loretta is a voluptuous larger lady who also wears glasses!<br /><br />The hero is a adventuresome, hulk of a sea captain-a well-told hero with his own set of good and bad qualities. The interplay between the two characters is very funny.<br /><br />Since I find that the majority of historicals seem to fall in either regency, medievel, or old west-this book is a wonderful change of pace and a thoroughly enjoyable time period to \\"visit\\".<br /><br />While the book has a few minor foibles, it's really none worth noting in the overall review. This is an excellent beginning novel from a new author. I was delighted by this book and look forward to reading more from this author in the future.	2005-01-01

The story and characters were enjoyable but seemed like your typical fare in many historicals.<br /><br /> One interesting part was that the hero fell hard for the heroine early on but it takes her till almost the end to realize she loves him. I personally did not like the way the author tries to write the Scottish Brogue out in the speaking sentances-I found it hard to decipher and literally headache enducing:)<br /><br />While the heroine's fiery spirit and pluckiness was fun in the beginning, her increasing pranks and tricks to convince the hero she's \\"mad\\" grate on you as the book wears on and turn very immature-so much so that I found I almost disliked her towards the end.<br /><br />About the only redeeming side in this book was the very sensual love scenes and the more sensible side romance between the heroine's brother and best friend . Though I found it weird that the hero, seeing the heroine in alot of ghoulish make up as she was trying to make him think she's disfigured, he can't help being not attracted to her-but then proceeds to have sex with her anyway!!!<br /><br /> I guess I'm ambivalant whether I liked this book-I had to force myself through the last 40 pages, by then I just wanted then all to grow up and go away:)	2004-12-29

The heroine, Amanda, is the eldest sister of a large family-since her parents death, this smart, gutsy lady of 26 years (a bluestocking) has had to raise her younger siblings. The hero, Justin, is a good natured captain who fought with Amanda's brother and has to bring her sad news.<br /><br />The couple are both opinionated and sparks fly. Justin is determined to do right by Amanda's genteel if impovished family. Both characters are sensible and down to earth-which is very refreshing since many regency heroines tend to be flighty, IMO.<br /><br />A delightful Christmas read that can be enjoyed any time of the year. Miss Overfield is a great writer and I plan to pick up her other regencies. Fantastic secondary characters make this a near perfect book. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and highly recommend!	2004-12-27

I enjoy strong heroines and this one, Sue, just struck me as about the weakest I've seen in awhile. IMO, a modern, paranormal novel is not the book one see's a heroine that thinks it would be better to have herself killed, than  write off her vile, contemptuous family-who have used and abused her physically as a servant and mentally abused her-but, in her words \\"they're still my family\\"!<br /><br />While I normally enjoy werewolf books-this particular world where the werewolf is a slavering beast who will kill without conpunction-but, lo and behold, he won't harm a hair on the heroines head and follows her around like a puppy a bit inplausible. My preference is one or the other-uncontrolled werewolf or intelligent \\"were\\" who can control it's needs.<br /><br />Maybe it got better-I'll never know-there are too many other books out there than to waste time on the bad ones. I did give the book two stars because the writers style, if not the substance, was fairly good.	2004-12-27

I thoroughly enjoyed this shorter, sweet novel that renews fans with their favorite family, the Malory's. If you loved the different characters from the various books and want to see a slice of their holiday lives and see how they are \\"doing\\"-then I think you'll enjoy this. I also found the story of the romance of Anna and Christopher Malory very sweet and charming-and is a nice lil way to \\"tie up\\" loose ends, explaining why some Malory's are a bit adventuresome and gifted, and leading into a much anticipated union for two of the older, beloved characters.<br /><br />If you are looking for a full length, sensual romance focusing on two main characters, then your looking at the wrong book. But if you want a endearing, uplifting story to read this holiday season I'd recommend this book. It's like having old friends stop by to visit and you'll finish the book with a smile on your face:)	2004-12-23

My main problem was the inept, flighty, weak willed heroine, who seems to have many moments where she's just TSTL-LOL!

Likewise the hero, Ramsey Kellogg, an ex-pinkerton detective, is a hard living, hard drinking man who's hired to protect the saloons-and his die hard reasons for doing so are as misguided as hers. This is a good story of two people in search of family and running from the worst sorts of family in their pasts. If you enjoy reading Western romance you'll probably enjoy this story. The two characters are a lil too slow to realize the error of their ways, IMO, but they do have a happy ending. The love scenes are B-, I'd give the overall story a B+.	2004-12-19

In most regencies you either see an \\"unmatched\\" couple buck society and be possibly snubbed for true love OR do the \\"noble\\" thing and marry for a proper match and forsake true love.  The two characters in this book do the latter but meet up again 10 years later.  I'm one of those who would rather they face scandal and be together so this was not my cup of tea.

Does a person's past actions dictate if they are worthy of true love? This is the question that this book is based on. Cathy Maxwell has written a wonderful, sweet tale about the hardships that all of us-rich and poor-have to sometimes face, and what our choices mean to our future.<br /><br /> I found all the characters interesting-a few who are stalwart, and some to be enjoyed if for no other reason than their obvious flawed character. The hero and heroine are beautiful-but not perfect-and that is what endears them to the reader. The hero in particular is a genuinely good man, and good lord to his people. They are both, along with the oppressive mother in law, in heart lonely and in search of a family. They are also ruled by the dictates of the regency era ton. A thoroughly enjoyable book that I heartily recommend.	2004-12-08

The other reviewers have good points, about unlikely names, or if this was that time period, the sisters would have been killed for being witches. BUT, the story is a sweet, fantastical tale-a fairy tale filled with creatures like winged horses, trolls, crones, seers, and yes, even fairies:). It's light, enjoyable reading.
