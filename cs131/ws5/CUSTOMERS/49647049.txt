War is sold to the American people like a new brand of soap with magical qualities. When the war drums start beating one must remember that all governments lie to get their own way - even the \\"best\\" governments lie and spin to get their own way. The author doesn't have much of a solution. However, if we are not blind to the fact that the our government has used the 9/11 disaster to become a war mongering government, we will be wiser and not so easily swayed. According to the author - America has the most pro war government in the world right now. It is essential that we stop this war.	2005-08-29

The Nazi Government in Germany was especially evil as it attacked many millions of its own people and neighboring peoples. The Nazi Government which was, as is always the case in evil governments, run by a relatively few number of people with awesome power, was on a murderous rampage in Europe. A very few courageous people stood up in opposition. One of these people is Major Plagge. It is thrilling to read of his courage, bravery and success. Everyone should read this book. Hopefully, then more persons could stand up against evil governments before its too late. Why is it that of all the species on the Earth that Man is the most evil? It is because of the accumulation of power in the hands of a few people. That is always a recipe for disaster.	2005-08-28

There is no formula and there is no immediate answer. We need to comfort and inspire each other to reach up higher. This book is a spiritual journey. It asks questions such as where did we come from, why are we here and what happens at death? The author has had a battle with prostate cancer and this has aroused his interest in all of these spiritual questions. Certainly the world needs changing, but it starts with the human heart and the ways in which the human being positions himself in the bigger world around him.	2005-07-03

The book raises provocative and troubling questions. There are many hazards in the world today and additional hazards in how our country is dealing with these hazards. When we need less saber rattling, we now have more saber rattling. I think it can be argued that our leadership is not up to the task at hand. I think it also be argued that our under-educated electorate is not up to the task at hand of putting our best citizens into roles of leadership. Based upon the facts and analysis in this excellent book we may have no choice but to be pessimistic as we continue to put our heads in the sand.	2005-07-03

However, our system, and many people serving on juries act as if it is worse to let a guilty person go free than it is to convict an innocent person.<br /><br />It is impossible to understand why juries convict persons who might possibly be innocent. If the juror could stand in the shoes of an innocent person being wrongly convicted, how could that juror ever let this happen.	2005-06-28

America is one of the wealthiest countries in the world because of our adherence to the freemarket system. However, our citizens rank near the bottom in health status. Americans have lower life expectancy, more health-related morbidity and higher adolescent death rates than most other advanced nations in the world and even some developing countries.<br /><br />With the exception of a few of our high technology medical advances that will benefit a very small percentage of the population, the overall condition of our preventive and maintenance healthcare and its delivery is in terrible condition. To function in the freemarket and be productive each person needs the best overall health possible. To obtain healthcare and good health in general must not be a fruit of that individual's success in the freemarket system. For our system to function properly, be fair, be wise, be compassionate and, in fact, to not be evil, healtcare must be a right for every citizen and must not be dependent upon a person's ability or even willingness to pay money. After a decent level of good healthcare is provided to each citizen, then, and only then, can that person swim in the freemarket ocean where he/she will sink or swim based on their ability, their intelligence and their willingness to expend effort. To have a fair chance at success which will benefit both the individual and all of society, each person needs to be provided with the availability and ease of access to both preventive healthcare and basic healthcare delivery.	2005-06-18

It is the most important thing we have. The slogan on the New Hampshire license tells how very important our freedom is. It reads \\"Live Free or Die.\\" If the American people allow fear to change their thinking - it will be a very sad day. Fear of terrorism could very well be far more dangerous to us than actual terrorism.<br /><br />The tragedy of 9/11 is far more than the terrible suicide attack of that day. The greatest tragedy could be in our own hands. If the American people give up their freedoms to the government for the illusion of safety from terrorism it would be a huge tragedy. The worst terrorism in history has always been committed by out-of-control governments such as what happened in Russia and Germany in the last 100 years. American People, do not ever give up your freedoms to the government such as some of the provisions in the patriot act that give away your freedom. The entire vitality of the American experience has been and always will be, if we are to stay vital, the placing of individual freedom as the most important value in the land. No amount of marginal illusionary additional security gained by giving up our freedoms could ever be worth it as we would watch the destruction of the vitality of our land.	2005-06-18

What matters in a blessed society is how the wealth is distributed. Even in a very wealthy country as in America, uneven and idiotic distribution of the wealth is leading to corruption of CEOs and large corporations, disintegration of health care delivery, and unbelievable amounts of misery in families where husband and wife have to both work to survive. It used to be that one spouse worked outside the home and the other spouse worked inside the home available for the raising of children. With all of the wealth in America, the healthcare delivery system is one of the most inefficient and corrupt delivery systems one could even imagine. Without good preventice and curative healthcare for Americans the country will fail and it will be a completely avoidable tragedy caused by raw greed. By far the number one priority for America should be quality healthcare for all Americans not based on social standing, who you know, or the money in your bank account.	2005-06-11

This book is no better than the hundreds of TV shows she has been on convicting persons of crimes without a trial again and again. There is at least one famous case in Utah where Nancy Grace convicted a man on TV who was eventually proved to be 100% innocent, but who died in jail where he was placed for no reason, in part, because of the ranting and raving of Nancy Grace and other TV stars who jumped to the wrong conclusion without knowing the facts. As I write this the jury is in deliberation on the Jackson case, and Nancy is mocking Michael Jackson for going to the hospital and she is \\"telling the world\\" that she thinks he is guilty. Keep in mind that the jury is not even sequestered. Where is the justice? Not to be found here.	2005-06-10

Aging is not so inevitable as most of us think it is. However, help is very slow in coming for reasons that have to do with the complexities of the human body and its coding. My grandfather, age 91, cut his hand and brand new cells grew in quickly. In fact, it was not even scar tissue as the cut was not deep. They were brand new skin cells covering his hand. However, even though they were brand new functioning skin cells, they were age 91 in appearance and quality. We are simply programmed to age genetically. The genetic coding can be changed safely to alter this grotesque aging process.<br /><br />Our best friend, the dog, ages about 7 times faster than we do even though his bodily systems are very similar to ours. There is no reason for this much shorter lifespan based on wear-and-tare or some degradation of the dog's bodily system. It happens due to genetic coding which can ultimately be changed.	2005-06-05

This book tells the terrible story. This is not a new problem. Even in the American Civil War about 100,000 soldiers were age 15 or youngr. Many parts of this book are shocking as it explains the recruitment, training, and discipline of these young children as they are developed into brutal soldiers at the same time that they are robbed of their childhood.	2005-05-31

We now live in a world communtity. Just at the time the entire world is moving into a world communtiy, some (many) in America are trying to move in the other direction - into more isolation. The many forms of nationalism that exist and say that our people are better, more important, smarter than your people are basically evil. All human beings deserve equal treatment as we enter the world community which will eventually treat all persons on the planet earth with respect, care and compassion. The history of nationalism is one of overwhelming evil. One dramatic example of the evils of nationalism is that of Nazi Germany. However, there are many more subtle evils to nationalism that infect this world chronically. Nationalism doesn't have to be an acute infection as in the case of Nazi Germany to do damage.	2005-05-31

This is advanced Jefferson studies about sexuality, slavery, prostitution, concubines and the many darker and even immoral sides of Jefferson and our other founding fathers. I find this book to be dark, but a book that tells the truth about Jefferson and other founding fathers and does not put them up on a pedestal as do most biographies. Americans have been brought up to treasure our founding fathers in a mystical way. As always the truth gets a short stick. Hopefully, someday in the future our civilization will evolve to cherish and adore the truth about the world around us. Sadly, at this point in time much of the truth is hidden from us, especially as pertains to our national leaders.	2005-05-29

The polarization has roots in our massive merchandising economy, our religions, our fears, our ignorance and more. Males and females are so polarized in our society that it is truly a tragedy. Actually, males and females are very much the same people who have been exposed to various varying hormone baths starting early in the womb. Some of these hormone baths are natural and some are manmade. In simple terms it is testosterone vs. estrogen. We all have both hormones, but in varying concentrations. After birth we make our own hormones based on our genetic codes and on our exposure to environmental factors.<br /><br />Our gender characteristics are on a continuum. Only a few of us are the \\"perfect\\" male or the \\"perfect\\" female. The tremendous polarization in our society is acting as if there was no continuum. As we all try to fit in to our place in this polarization we may face many challenges of clinical depression, self esteem and self identity. In the United States one's gender is all too often determined by one's anatomical sex, no matter how ambiguous it might happen to be. From birth we are bombarded with gender propaganda that supports a regressive dual gender system pitting the sexes (genders) against one another. Transgender Nation looks at the male to female journey some people take as they try to find their place on the continuum.<br /><br />One example of our society's polarizing the genders is that restrooms in our society are almost always polarized into men and women. This is even done in the many restrooms where only one person enters at a time so privacy is not an issue. Making these private restrooms male or female is just one sad example of how our society polarizes the genders.	2005-05-28

The huge amount of spending by our ballooning government is destroying the fabric of our country. People do not know that most welfare does not go to low income persons, but instead goes to giant corporations so that they can pay top management tens of millions of dollars. People do not know that the middleclass is being vaporized by governement and corporate policies. The government and giant corporations are in cohoots. People do not know that welfare to low income persons helps the country immediately because the money is put back into the economy immediately. People do not know that the vast amounts of welfare paid to giant corporations do not help the economy because is money is sidelined and put back into the economy very slowly or taken out of the country. We do not need all of this wasted spending.	2005-05-16

The system screens out all potential jurors who have the wisdom to understand the fact that the death penalty should never be an option because it is evil and exploits our animal instinct for revenge and vengence. The government that murders one of its own people in revenge for a crime that may have been committed is a government unwilling to set a good example for its own citizens.

This is an inside the bus look at the campaigns. The book, I believe, achieves it purpose of exposing what goes on in presidential campaigns. It is not a pretty picture. In fact, it is a very ugly picture of sound bites, scripting, fatigue, painted on smiles and even boredom. Most Americans have not been to a presidential campaign rally and probably would find them very distasteful. The way a candidate wins the race is to say very little and to say the same thing day after day with a smile painted on his/her face. A real candidate such as Howard Dean who speaks more than just a script will lose. Our democratic system is not bringing us the best people to be our president because the truth is too elusive and too easily distorted.	2005-05-14

The utility of force is more limited than most Americans realize. The new American militarism is now a problem as we now place too much emphasis on military force as we have overvalued its utility.<br /><br />The United States spends more on defense than all of the rest of the world combined by some accounts. US forces are prowling around the entire globe. Self-restraint is lacking on America's part.<br /><br />The author makes the case for a military draft as we need to have a citizen military where the people have a direct stake in our country's military policy so that we have adequate checks and balances on the overreach of the military. The author also makes the case that many of the hundreds of billions of dollars that we have spent on the military would have been better spent on energy independence.	2005-05-08

Our reputation, our wisdom, our validity, our values, our respect for life, our honor, our future standing in the world and our ultimate ability to get the best intelligence is all dependent upon our ability to treat prisoners with respect and compassion and to never torture prisoners. To torture a prisoner is always evil and self-defeating and will never represent the goodness that our country is based on. This book and others like it are eye-opening. It is very difficult to understand what logic could possibly indicate that torture is a good thing. There is no such logic.

IBM provided super-fast punchcard sorting equipment to the evil Nazis which where used to keep track of and sort out the populations in the countries which the Nazis controlled. The Nazis identified and tracked the populations of all peoples which they, The Nazis, deemed to be inferior peoples. These peoples were killed, tortured and placed in concentration camps and stripped of all their posessions. We must remember that these atrocities were performed under the direction of the highest politicians in the German government. When politicians, such as these, gain too much power over the people they often will turn rotten.

It is about a lack of money, and it is about far more. It is also about the myth that if one works hard that one will not be poor. In fact, most persons who are poor do work hard. Most hard work is rewarded at a low level of pay because our system rewards the employer who pays at the lowest level that can be achieved.<br /><br />The author discusses the problem of Asthma in America caused primarily by the poor living in cities and in poor housing. He also discusses malnutrition in America.<br /><br />The more money we invest in our children, the lesser amount of money we will need to invest in prisons. More than that, if we will reduce the poverty of millions of children then we will have a much more wonderful society in which to live. Our society works in part like a chain-link fence. That is, the overall quality of our society is no better than the weakest link in our \\"chain-link fence\\" of security for our citizens.	2005-04-16

The audience survey almost always answers the question correctly. This is just one well-known example of the wisdom of crowds.<br /><br />Crowds are often wiser than individuals, even experts, if certain conditions are met. Conditions needed for crowds to be wise are as follows:<br /><br />1. Diversity of perspectives<br /><br />2. Independence of individuals within the group<br /><br />3. Decentralization, aka local experience<br /><br />4. Aggregation - the integration of different views & opinions<br /><br />The author makes the case for the value of group decisions as long as the group is properly arranged to be effective. He shows how these decisions can be better quality than the decisions of individuals, even experts. These concepts form the backbone of our democratic governmental system. The lack of collective wisdom is often seen in the dangerous case of an autocratic-charismatic leader.	2005-04-14

However, it is the economics in the world that determine how the world actually works. \\"Freakonomics\\" turns up the hidden side and secret aspects of almost anything in life whose economics determine the reality of the world in which we live.<br /><br />The authors show that economics is the study of incentives - how people get what they want, or need, especially when in competition with others who want or need the same things. They provide the readers with many interesting and fascinating topics to make their case that economics of all sorts (legal, illegal & even strange) determine the nature of the world in which we live.

This book does not replace visits to the Museum. It is an excellent reference book to have in combination with visits to the Museum. The Holocaust Museum is one of the finest Museums in Washington, DC.<br /><br />The history told at the Museum is powerful in so many ways. My hope is that humanity can learn from history not to keep repeating the many horrific mistakes that were made during the period of Hitler and Stalin. We must always remember that most of the terrible crimes during this period were sanctioned, promoted and authorized by National Governments. The Governments of nations can and do become evil, corrupt and murderous. We the people of the world must be forever vigilant against vesting too much power in the hands of too few people. Concentrated power almost always becomes corrupt.<br /><br />We must learn from history how to prevent the concentrations of power in too few people. These concentrations of power can sooner or later lead to evil. Even power that is initially built on good intentions will good bad eventually. That is the nature of the human condition that we must fear that charismatic leaders will concentrate power in ways that are unhealthy and deadly. We should find ways to avoid electing charismatic leaders as these types of leaders are just too dangerous. The Holocaust happened just seconds ago in terms of the lifespan of our planet, and something like it will happen again unless we learn the lessons taught to us by history.	2005-04-12

These big egos have led to hundreds of selfish corporate mergers of which at least half have been disasters for the workers and stockholders. In many of these mergers the only persons who benefit are a few managers at the top who end up with golden parachutes. Enough of these big egos. We need more humble and faithful leaders in the future. High-energy is fine. Intelligence is wonderful. However, the giant egos and the one-hundred million dollar pay packages are a disgrace. Let's stop killing off the middleclass and destroying our Country. Our leaders only deserve a modest multiple of the middleclass pay rates.<br /><br />Jack says that if you, average worker, work for a company and there are problems at the top, then you can just quit that company and go someplace else. Do not complain. It is not ever that simple for the average worker. Most workers have limited choices and are powerless to deal with corruption at the top of the company where they work. In most companies the power is held by a few persons at the top who are often too detached from the plight of the vast majority of workers.	2005-04-08

Does anyone know?<br /><br />In any event, the book is very interesting. I couldn't put it down. I read about half of it before I even purchased it. It is a fast read as I am, along with many other people, familiar with the case. I also read \\"Blood Brother\\", the book written by Scott's sister, Anne Bird. That book was excellent and more intimate as Scott lived with Anne after Laci's murder and revealed himself to her in a most incriminating way.<br /><br />What is most amazing about both books is the mountains of circumstancial evidence that they have piled up showing that Scott murdered his wife and unborn son. The mountains of circumstantial evidence are overwhelming. It is impossible to even imagine a scenario in which all of this circumstantial evidence could point to Scott not being the murderer. In terms of probability, the probability that Scott is the murderer would work out to something like 9,999 chances in 10,000. There is far more evidence than one will find in most convictions.<br /><br />I am not a big believer in circumstantial evidence. However, in this case the evidence is overwhelming. In addition, the case is not based on eyewitness testimony which is some of the worst evidence used to convict persons. This, in itself, is a plus.<br /><br />The picture that emerges of Scott in both books is that of a classic sociopath. However, that does not make him a murderer. It just explains his lack of remorse. Interestingly enough, some big time CEOs and CFOs are sociopaths. Again they do not have ordinary remorse for the damage that they do when they steal from or destroy the Company that they lead.	2005-04-08

BookTV has an excellent author interview available which was taped on 3/3/05. The author discusses hush orders at universities that are taking corporate money. This taking of corporate money usually does not serve the public good because the university has to serve its coporate master. Academic freedom is damaged.<br /><br />The author, Jennifer Washburn, explains that historically universities have always placed great importance on academic freedom. Now, with the lust for money, research universities are becoming more like corporations and sometimes invest the university's own endowment into ventures where the university is attempting to profit on its own research. There is a blurring of the lines between business and academic independence.<br /><br />There is a tension between teaching and research at universities. Teaching has been downsized with more resources going into research.<br /><br />There is a need for much more stringent conflict-of-interest rules. Unfortunately, some professors have their own business ventures on the side and are bleeding research results into the business ventures.	2005-03-27

For example, asteroids pose a long-term risk hundreds and thousands of years into the future. We have the technology now to map asteroids and safeguard our future. To a large extent this is not being done. There is a lack of scientific enthusiasm to do this.<br /><br />Global warming is another topic of interest. Glaciers are melting right now. The gravity of the problem is increasing. However, it would be very expensive to do anything about it. So, not much is being done to correct the problem. Even if we reduce emissions into the atmosphere, the build-up is cumulative so that the problem increases even with reduced emisssions. Heavy taxes on CO2 emissions would be scientifically helpful, but politically impossible.<br /><br />Scientists tend to be either too pessimistic or too optimistic regarding the future. The reality, actually, is somewhere in the middle. Yet, the risks tend to be misstated.<br /><br />How does the marketplace respond to future risks? Reinsurance companies are very concerned about global warming. The risk is difficult to quantify. Global warming will effect the weather in the future.<br /><br />The author talks about the risks of terrorism. His position is that terrorism is very difficult to prevent. Our borders may be too porous.<br /><br />The author covers possible future disasters in this book which include biodiversity loss, sudden global warming, bioterrorists, asteroid impacts, and nuclear meltdowns.

This fact, alone, indicates that the book has been inspirational and helpful to a great many people. Now, the book is back at the top of the bestseller list again because it was so helpful to Ashley Smith as she ministered to Brian Nichols for over 7 hours on that terrible day when Nichols shot 4 people with a sheriff's gun. The sheriffs carry a gun in a their holsters to stop and kill a person in custody who tries to escape or otherwise misbehaves. Guns should not be in a courthouse. It is too deadly. This day, however, Brian Nichols turned the tables which tragic results.<br /><br />Against all wisdom, there were deadly guns on holsters in the courthouse that terrible day and a tragedy did happen. Hence it came to pass that Brian Nichols, a hunted man, found himself on Ashley's doorstep in a terrible predictament.

We have over 2,000,000 citizens in prison in the land of the free. Most of these citizens are non-violent and about 15% are mentally ill in need medical care. With the tax dollars that we pay we treat some non-violent prisoners in ways that are just horrible. It is done by politicians who want to get reelected and understand a terrible fact that the uninformed citizens vote for politicians who advocate building more prisons and filling them to overcrowded capacity with more prisoners. Only a small percentage of the citizenship understand the terrible cost to our society with this practice. It is a cost in billions of dollars and much more. It is also a cost in respect, common sense, decency and the goodness of the American people.<br /><br />On top of this, studies indicate that about 10 -15% of prisoners are completely innocent and had absolutely nothing to do with the crime that they were put in prison for. This is because juries do not understand and respect the bedrock of the system which is \\"proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" The large amount of reasonable doubt that is ignored by juries is shocking to the conscious of any good person.	2005-03-07

Of course, most of the readers of the book do not know anything about Anne Bird. Assuming she is not an evil person her convincing book takes away the small amount of lingering doubt that remained in some minds after the trial. Writing such a book condemning her brother is certainly an unusual move. However, Laci's murder was such an unusual case and so brutal that being convinced of Scott's guilt she would almost have to speak out.<br /><br />This book is much better than one would expect in a case like this. The book is much better than the many thousands of hours of TV coverage of the Peterson case. Scott Peterson lived with the author and her husband for weeks after the murder of his wife. Even as a sociopath he could not hide the truth from his sister for weeks. As one would expect, the truth came out during that time. If you were a big-time TV watcher of the case, as you read this book with the inside information that only a family insider could provide, you will probably feel that many of those hours watching TV were wasted hours as they were not close enough to the case to provide the inside scoop that this book provides.	2005-03-04

The first one-third of the book is a \\"course\\" in mathematics to help explain the laws of the universe. This book is extraordinary in that it will hold your attention through over 1000 pages on a challenging subject matter. The author, Roger Penrose, takes great care as you proceed through the book to prepare you for the science that lies ahead. The book needs to be read in the order presented and each section needs to be understood before going on to the next section.<br /><br />Penrose's book is exciting, informative and hopefully will turn new students on to the joys of scientific learning. The book is likely to get new high school students excited about science so they can go on to careers in cosmology, chemistry, biology, medicine and the other sciences. There is something for everyone in this book and the author has gone to great effort to make the material available to the layperson.<br /><br />For the reader the best part of the book comes in the 2nd half after the reader learns the basics in the 1st half. The reader learns about classical physics, relativity, quantum mechanics, string theory, twisters, gravity, black holes, the big bang and much more. The bottom line is that the book is never boring, but it certainly is challenging.	2005-02-27

Let's explain actual innocence. We are talking about the cases when a person has nothing to do with a crime and is not connected to the crime in any way, not about a technicality, but about a person just like the reader of this book who has absolutely nothing to do with a crime. This is, you must admit, a terrifying situation. However, it happens again and again. Read the book \\"Bloodsworth\\" as a good true story on how this kind of thing happens.<br /><br />How does this happen? Unfortunately, it happens too easily. One reason is because eyewitness testimony is incredibly unreliable and almost never reaches the quality of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But this is not properly explained to juries by the judges or prosecutors because too many cases rely on eyewitness testimony and if the truth be known then prosecutors would not be able to get enough convictions to satisfy the publics thrist for revenge when a crime has occurred.<br /><br />One way out of this mess is DNA, but only when DNA is available and only when the lead is pursued. In the case of Bloodsworth, mentioned above, who was 100% actually innocent, he finally got out of the mess after almost ten years of living hell and only because a good lawyer found a small amount of DNA.<br /><br />How many innocent people are in prison because of ridiculous eyewitness testimony and where there is no way out without a good lawyer and some DNA?	2005-02-23

She reports that her course \\"the sociology of deviance\\" is a rare sociology course that is not being taught in most universities. She says this is because many behaviors that were formerly labeled as deviant are no longer being referred to as deviant.<br /><br />This book is about many forms of behavior that the author thinks should be reclassified as deviant. This is not a good book. The author is interested in putting black labels on behaviors that have shades of gray. She as a conservative, with right-wing type thinking apparently would like to take all behaviors that she doesn't like and label them as deviant. This is really a political book more than it is a sociology book. One gets the feeling that she would like to label more and more people as deviant as a sponsorship of her right-wing views. This book is a dangerous book. This book is very political and it is an effort to take our culture away from the political center where our culture can best serve the needs of all citizens.	2005-02-22

She is sometimes funny and her accounts of her training and her short career in the CIA are interesting and easy to read. The book portrays the CIA agency as too partisan and somewhat incompetant. She does talk about the 9/11 tragedy and as a person who was inside the CIA does blame the agency in part for not preventing that disaster.<br /><br />One of the most interesting parts of the book is the expensive and detailed training that she and all new case workers undergo at the CIA. Her short career cost the government a lot of money. One hopes that this doesn't happen too often as it is all being paid for by the hapless taxpayer.	2005-02-20

It is supply and demand of workers, not gender discrimination.<br /><br />The author introduces 25 factors of jobs and careers that make the jobs either less desirable or more demanding or both. Some of these factors are long hours, more travel, commission only, irregular hours, high risk, etc. Jobs containing one or more of these factors may pay a bigger paycheck but always at a cost to the worker such as time away from home, longer commute, taking the job home at night, dangerous environment, etc. Pay differences are determined mostly by who is willing to take these \\"worse\\" jobs. In fact when all of these 25 factors are controlled so that you have either a man or woman in the same job, the women on average earn the same as men or more than men in about 90 job classifications.	2005-02-20

Dean \\"lived\\" inside of the former out-of-control Nixon administration. Now we have the out-of-control Bush administration. Dean address issues including too much secrecy in the current administration.<br /><br />Dean convincingly makes the point that the level of secrecy and scandal in the Bush administration is worse than what happened in the Nixon administration. Dean has the inside knowledge of how administrations work that most of us could never have a clue as to these inside workings. In Dean's estimation, the secrecy with which Bush and Cheney govern is an obessive strategy meant to conceal a deeply troubling agenda of corporate favoritism and a dramatic growth in unchecked power that is putting at risk the lives of American citizens, civil liberties, and the Constitution.	2005-02-19

The Bush campaign was very well-oiled and disciplined. Kerry's inability to counter the swift boat ads was just devastating to Kerry and may have made the difference in the election.<br /><br />The book has the inside story how how Kerry lost. It is not really that Bush won, but what really happened is that Kerry lost. In many ways Kerry and his campaign team just dropped the ball. They certainly dropped the ball on national health insurance. Over 41,000,000 Americans have no health insurance and are in desperate shape. They could have brought more than enough votes to the Kerry side to win.<br /><br />Kerry also could have won if he could have found a way to convince the voters of the truth of the war in Iraq, that it is a war of choice, not really a war of national security. In fact, there have been many good arguments that the war in Iraq has done just the opposite - it has put us at more risk, not less.<br /><br />The Republican well-oiled political machine has learned how to get the sound bites out to the red states that have maniputated the voters in the red states that do not have the time, the skill or the inclination to understand the political process at a deeper level than the sound bites.<br /><br />The election was close enough that many different things could have changed the outcome.

This is the author's first book. Sam Harris, the author, is now working on his doctorate in neuroscience. He has studied Eastern and Western religious traditions, along with a variety of spiritual disciplines for twenty years. Harris calls for the end of religious faith in the modern world and identifies religious beliefs as the core of many of the human atrocities throughout history. He argues that our willingness to ignore reason and scientific facts as we maintain our beliefs, not based on sound science and reason, will lead the world into more peril because these beliefs not only legitimize intolerance, but they have also invaded most aspects of political and secular life and threaten to become apocalyptic in a world with weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />The author believes that all religions are harmful, not just extremist & terrorist religions, which are obviously harmful. He sees those who practice moderate religion as a bigger part of the problem than some people think because they provide a foundation of unreason that radicals, fundamentalists and religious terrorists build upon.<br /><br />What is a belief? A belief is a powerful force that once it is internalized moves almost everything else in a person's life. Beliefs define one's vision of the world, one's behavior and one's emotional responses. Beliefs are principles of action. It is through beliefs that we predict events and consider the likely consequences of our actions and therefore guide our behavior. The power beliefs have over our emotional lives is total because for every emotion we are capable of feeling, there is a belief that evokes it.<br /><br />What is faith? The Bible defines faith as the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. It seems to say that faith is entirely self-justifying. Religious faith is unjustified belief in the most important matters that we have been convinced we don't need to justify.<br /><br />The terrorists who committed the atrocities on September 11 have been described as men of profound (extremist) religious faith. There were serious reports that they expected to receive the very best rewards in heaven for their efforts. This is just one example of the dangers that we all face when persons do not base their actions on reason. Another example is the Inquisition which began in the year 1184 and continued in parts of the world until 1834. In the name of God, countless innocents were tortured and murdered for heresy. All the perpetrators of these atrocities were men of God including popes, bishops, friars and priests.<br /><br />Seeking more knowledge in our world is in a way the opposite of faith. Faith relies on unquestioned, closed mindedness. Wanting to know more about our world leaves us vulnerable to new evidence. The thing that will permit human beings to work together with open minds in making a better world is our willingness to have our beliefs modified by reasoned facts.<br /><br />What does religion offer? There is a clear difference between religious moderates and religious extremists. However, both pose a danger to reason. This is because moderates underestimate the effect that faith has had on man's inhumanity to man, and they wrongly advocate the belief that faith is an essential component of human life. There is a myth that moderation is far superior to more extremist religious faith. It is not moderate to believe in the Bible and the God of organized religion because these beliefs are not in line with reason and there is no evidence to support these beliefs.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that moderates have had to make the decision to ignore or loosely interpret the bible in order to live coherently in the modern world. Living in a world where a single world leader can annihilate millions based on faith, it must be argued that we no longer have a right to our myths.<br /><br />Spirituality,of course, is not a myth. There are degrees of human experiences of meaningfulness, selflessness, awareness and heightened emotions that go beyond our current understanding of the mind. Spirituality is the range of experiences that exceed our ordinary-everyday limits of subjectivity and include exploring new and changed emotions as well as cognitive and conceptual new awarenesses. Spirituality respects the fact healthy skepticism is important, and that skepticism does not in any way diminish spirituality.s of meaningfulness, selflessness, awareness and heightened emotions that go beyond our current understanding of the mind.

It is a nonpartisan guide. Matthews believes that the rules of politics apply to every human life, not just to senators and congressmen. Here are some of the rules of politics as put forth by Matthews:<br /><br />1. It is not who you know, it is who you get to know. Washington is like working in a big Company where it is who you know is more important than what you know. The key to your success in life is based upon your personal relationships. Nearly everyone in Washington owes their job to a personal friend.<br /><br />2. All politics is local.<br /><br />3. It is better to receive than give. Ask for help. The more someone invests in you, the more committed they become to seeing you succeed. As Benjamin Franklin once said, \\"If you want to make a friend, let someone do you a favor.\\"<br /><br />4. Dance with the one that brung ya. It is about loyalty to your side. Think about the loyalty that Ronald Reagan had to the conservative movement.<br /><br />5. Keep your ememies in front of you. Great politicians always stay on speaking terms with fierce opponents to show strength, obtain useful information and because they know that they may have to call on the opponent as an ally some day.<br /><br />6. Don't get mad, don't get even, get ahead. Focus on getting past your adversaries.<br /><br />7. Leave no shot unanswered. Always respond to attacks quickly and effectively by attacking the credibility of your opponent, ridicule your opponent, and reverse the attack so it backfires against your opponent.<br /><br />8. Only talk when it improves the silence. Know when to speak and when to listen.<br /><br />9. Always concede on principal. In many cases, the best way to achieve one's goal is to concede the argument. Great politicians often negotiate by telling their adversaries exactly what they want to hear. By conceding the principal at issue, they manipulate their critics into accepting their views.<br /><br />10. Hang a lantern on your problem. When in doubt, get it out.<br /><br />11. Spin, spin & spin. Always turn negatives into positives.<br /><br />12. The press is the enemy.<br /><br />13. Have the reputation of power. Political leaders become powerful by appearing powerful. There are six ways to appear powerful. They are: play your strengths, lowballing, sandbagging, creating new commandments, passing the buck, and put your opponent in a \\"put up or shut up\\" position.<br /><br />14.

Health Care in America has become big business with a primary focus of making a big profit. The free market is great for America, but is does not work for health care. The reason the free market does not work for health care is that the health care consumer in many cases is not making a real choice. The consumer that is rushed to the hospital has little or no free market choice. In any critical situation the person needing health care does not have free choice when facing life or death or any other critical situation.<br /><br />There is a big difference between health care and other goods and services where a consumer has a real choice. The market system does not work for health care. Our system is not about health care, but it is about the insurance reimbursement system. The USA health care system is a huge bureaucracy where billions of dollars are spent on the huge bureaucracy that has nothing to do with basic preventative and life-savings care.<br /><br />The leading cause of death in the USA is heart disease and has been so for decades. The second leading cause is cancer and has been so for decades. The third leading cause of death in the USA is new.

Tragically, the opposite is often the case. The government breaks its own laws with impunity and undermines the goodness of the Country.<br /><br />The author, Judge Napolitano, has written a very important book that states the true facts that our liberties are in grave danger and will fall unless we pay attention to this book and other books like it. The government's war on terrorism is of more danger to the citizenship than it may end up of being a hinderance to the terrorists. If we defeat the terrorists by defeating our own liberties we will have gained nothing, for sure.<br /><br />From the introduction to the book - The government, federal, state, and local, is not bound to obey its own laws. I know this sounds crazy, but the events recounted in this book prove it to be true. This book should be a wake-up call for every American who prizes personal liberty in a free society.

That is that the USA tax system is primarily regressive and not progressive as it is \\"advertised\\" to be. The USA tax system is very complex and there are many points that can be made. The book only covered some of them.<br /><br />The FICA tax is little more than an income tax because the money goes into the general fund. It is highly regressive and for many Americans more burdensome than the regular income tax. The FICA tax does not have deductions and is charged to the first dollar that one makes. Even if one has a low income with just enough money for necessities, he/she is fully taxed by the FICA & Medicare tax.<br /><br />The complexities of the tax system also make it very regressive since only the wealthy have the ability, knowledge, means, resources and access to expert advice to arrange their affairs in the many ways that minimize taxes. The reality is that many of the wealthy pay an overall tax rate that is the same as or even less than persons with modest and low incomes.<br /><br />The bottom line is that we should have known this, if we did not, because the tax system and the political process is run by the most powerful persons in our society and thay have constructed a regressive tax system to benefit the wealthy.<br /><br />(Hamden)	2005-02-01

It is Darwinian - it is the survival of the prettiest and most handsome. The author, Nancy Etcoff, proposes that valuing beauty is an essential and ineradicable part of human nature and that it is revered and ferociously pursued at enormous cost in nearly every civilization.<br /><br />This book from 1999 shows how outside the realm of ideas, beauty rules the day. According to the author, in the United States more money is spent on beauty than on education or social services. In fact, according to the author, 1484 tubes of lipstick are sold every minute of every day. There is tremendous power in a young woman's beauty.<br /><br />Also, the facts show that people are less likely to ask good-looking people for help. Our efforts to please good-looking people with no expectation of immediate reward are one way we reinforce beauty as a form of status.	2005-01-31

It is my reading of all of the major world religions that they have developed in service to humankind. Just because a person says that they are religous does not make it so.

The Red Cross report and other valid reports are in the book so that the reader can see for himself that the torture at Abu Ghraib was certainly far more than a few rotten apples that were military police serving in the reserves that were sent to Abu Ghraib.<br /><br />There was sadism at Abu Ghraib. There was a breakdown in law and order at Abu Ghraib. There was a breakdown in discipline at Abu Ghraib. This, of course, puts our entire Country and our entire military at risk.<br /><br />Not only is the torture wrong, but, beyond that, torture is ineffective and many of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib had no intelligence value in the first place. Torture is very harmful to our Country politically speaking. It is certainly the case that any information that was obtained by torture would be overshadowed by the political damage caused by the activities.	2005-01-16

The famous speech \\"ask not ......\\" told Americans that each individual was important. Other terms in the speech repeat that the individual is important, has a purpose and can make a difference. Americans were hungry for the words that Kennedy spoke in the speech. Americans wanted to do more for the Country over and above their own selfish interests. Kennedy had created this spirit of patriotism during his campaign and, therefore, the inaugural speech rang true. Kennedy closes the speech by saying that the listener could ask of his government the same spirit of helpfulness as the Country was asking of its citizens.<br /><br />The author is a micro historian and densely researched the short period of time surrounding the speech. The book is not broad spectrum but focused on this inauguration period only.	2005-01-16

You can be assured that the facts are startling and shocking. The book points out that half of the prisoners in the world are in the prisons and jails of the USA. It just gets worse from there. There are too many errors and too much lack of justice in our justice system.<br /><br />John Lamb killed one person and was executed for his crime. Sammy \\"The Bull\\" Gravano killed 19 persons and was given a soft sentance. In the USA there are about 22,000 homicides each year and only about 300 defendants are advanced to death row. They are almost all poor, have bad attorneys and are 99% male. Getting the death penalty is kind of a backwards lottery. If everything goes wrong, much of it out of the defendants control, such as your lawyer falling asleep in the courthouse, eyewitnesses lying (very common occurance), being born poor and being born the wrong gender, then the defendant may very well end up on death row. In order to \\"win\\" this horrific backwards lottery it helps to be on trial in Texas which has the most executions of any State. The law in texas is so punitive toward the defendant that at least one person was executed after he was found to be innocent by new evidence not allowed to be even considered due to an arbitrary 30 day time limit on bringing in new evidence.<br /> <br />	2005-01-05

There have been almost ten books in recent time delving into the issues of good drugs, dangerous drugs, ineffective drugs and the corrosive effects of commercial influence over medical research. This book goes into more detail and is more sophisticated than any of the others on this topic that I have seen.<br /><br />The list of problems that the consumer faces when taking many of these prescription drugs seems to be almost without limit. You will read about incomplete testing of drugs. You will also learn about testing in age groups that are different than the ultimate or target age groups. You will learn of drugs given to children without any non-adult testing. There are approved drugs such as Accutane that can have devastating results if the directions are not followed exactly.<br /><br />This book addresses the out-of-control drug advertising on TV, online and in print media. The costs of drugs are often based on whatever the market can bear, even when the key discoveries are not made by the drug company. The author explains that the real scientific evidence shows that many of the things that you can do to protect and maintain your own health are far more effective than what the drug companies products can do for you. Many of these things that you can do to stay healthy are more difficult to do than just popping a few pills - things like exercise, weight lose, stop smoking and eating a low-fat and low-carb diet.	2005-01-04

Some family members achieve better mental health and healing by searching for forgiveness and reaching out to the perpetrators rather than seeking retribution as the only answer.<br /><br />This book will open your eyes and your mind with stories of personal strength and forgiveness.

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	5	15	20	N	N	The Policies Of The Republican Party Benefit The Wealthy	Why do many of the red-staters vote against their own self interest. This book covers many of the reasons. The policies of the Republican Party tend to benefit the wealthy and the powerful at the great expense of the average workers and their families. The pro-life red-state factory worker will repeatedly vote for the Republican Party that is less likely to protect his safety, his job and is less likely to benefit him economically.<br /><br />According to the author the Republicans have duped the working-class people into voting for them, by speaking of the decline in the American cultural values as if it were caused by some kind of liberal conspiracy to lower moral standards, instead of voting for a more liberal political party that would be more focused on the economic wellbeing and healthcare of the middleclass.<br /><br />For those that are interested in this book and this author, Thomas Frank, Book TV C-Span2 has an author interview event available.	2005-01-01

The book talks about violence at all levels of society and shows that the death penalty is just another form of violence sponsored by the State. When compared to other advanced societies America is a very violent place and the state-sanctioned killing of the death penalty is just adding to and perpetuating that violence.<br /><br />One would hope that the government would set a good example for its citizens and stop the violence. The book points out that the death penalty is not needed for crime control as life imprisonment is available as an alternative. \\"Kiss of Death\\" brings a fresh reasoned approach to the debate. It shows why people should care.	2004-12-29

You can learn all about Objectivism on the web. She promotes Objectivism in a pure idealistic way in this novel as a faith. In the real world things are not so simple. Objectivism is in part a philosopy about the merits of being selfish so that each person can reach his/her full potential without interference from outside forces. The philosophy teaches that selfish interest provides the motivation to not only enrich oneself but to also enrich the community in which one lives because the interests are so very much entwined.	2004-12-28

The book makes the case that moderately overweight persons may not be at risk if they are physically active and eating a healthful diet. The author shows how a moderately active heavier person is likely to be far healthier and live longer than someone who is thin but sedentary.<br /><br />In addition, the book shows how a common problem of yo-yo dieting is more dangerous than not losing the weight in the first place. The book in many ways points out that the steps that people take to lose weight can be more dangerous than the excess weight itself. One example of this is the story of Fen-phen which is explained in the book.	2004-12-26

It tells the story of how all of our lives are so very much interconnected. It is excellent storytelling about the life of 83 year old Eddie, the main character of the story. Eddie learns after his death about the impact his life had on others and vice versa.<br /><br />This storytelling is very moving because it vividly brings home how all humans are interconnected in this world and the tremendous power that each of us has to impact the lives of others. At a time when many people feel powerless when surrounded by major world issues, it is so good to be reminded of the fact that each of us can make a difference in a big way in some of the lives around us.	2004-12-25

Sometimes the side effects will make a drug not worth the investment in money, time and health risk to the consumer.<br /><br />Dr. Abramson, the author, did painstaking research on this book. The USA spends nearly three times more money per capita on health care, compared to other advanced countries, but is near the bottom in the quality of healthcare received by its citizens.

This is a very good book about the problem of obesity in America. It is not a diet book. However, it can help a person with the motivation needed to succeed with a reduced calorie lifestyle. It is a simple book. Yet, it is well written and well focused on the causes of and the solutions to obesity.<br /><br />The metabolic cause of obesity is very simple in most cases. There are too many calories and not enough calorie-burning activities. First, the book explains where the calories are coming from. Next, the book explains who got the calories into our bellies along with our help. Then there is a discussion of the reasons why the calories build up on our bodies.<br /><br />The last half of the book discusses the devestating affects that too many calories and obesity can do to a person. It also discusses what can be done to help improve the situation. For some readers the book may actually scare them into losing weight.	2004-12-10

It is a very interesting read and you will be amazed at how the majority of Americans worry about the wrong things. \\"The Culture Of Fear\\" gives some of the answers as to why this is occurring.<br /><br />Why do Americans fear crime more when the crime rate is falling substantially? Why do Americans fear crime by stranger the most when over 80% of all crime is done by persons well known to the victim? Why do Americans fear exotic diseases far more than a disease such as heart disease which is far more deadly.

Tens of millions of Americans work full-time, year-round, for poverty level wages.<br /><br />You will learn that most of these jobs are not unskilled, that they require quite a high level of skill both physical and mental. You will learn that in most cases as rents go up that there is no corresponding rise in wages for the working poor and you will learn why this occurs. Our economic system as it is presently structured is wholly dependent upon tens of millions of working poor and upon the illusion that these same people do not have to be poor if they would just go out and get a better job.<br /><br />The reality is that vast amounts of wealth for a small percentage of the population is gained upon the backs of these working poor. This situation is continuing and will continue into the future because of the webs of denial about the working poor and the lies about how easy it is to move up the ladder. The author has both courage and empathy as she goes face to face with the problem and tells us frankly what is going on in the workplace.	2004-12-09

To a large extent the world has not listened and still is not listening. Man-made chemicals are very dangerous for not too complicated reasons. All living things are made up of chemical systems that evolved over millions of years. Before man-made chemicals were introduced chemical changes in the environment were very gradual. Now introduced chemicals are very powerful (spoken of in terms such as 3 parts per million)  because the biological systems have no previous exposure to these introduced chemicals in the DNA code.<br /><br />Rarely does a single book alter the course of history, but Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" did that, but not to the extent needed to fully protect the environment. As of 2004 the environment is losing and the chemicals are winning. Rachel Carson's message is now more important than ever. We hope people listen.	2004-12-09

There was no DNA database at the time. Yet the detectives step by step used DNA to exclude suspects until the murderer was \\"left standing.\\" There was a DNA dragnet with much suspense which the murderer managed to avoid until the very end. This is the true story of the first DNA conviction.<br /><br />Also, this reader suggests you read the new book \\"Bloodsworth.\\"<br /><br />This is the true story of the first DNA exoneration in the USA. These two cases are linked in a very important way.	2004-12-01

Due to the large number of places provided there is a minimal about of detail on each place. I would have preferred 500 places with twice as much detail on each place. I think that would have been a better balance.	2004-12-01

This story of aspirin goes all the way back to ancient Egypt and up to the present time 2004. In addition to it's remarkable history as a wonder drug aspirin holds promise in the prevention and treatment of many diseases including heart attacks, stroke, dementia and cancer. Also discussed are rival analgesics such as acetominophen(Tylenol) and ibuprofen(Advil).<br /><br />This reader also suggests you read a similar 5 star book from 1991 \\"Aspirin Wars, The: Money, Medicine, and 100 Years of Rampant Competition.\\" This book goes into more detail giving an interesting picture of over-the-counter drug marketing during the entire 20th century. Except for the fact that this book only has the history of aspirin until 1991, I would give it a higher rating than the newer book.	2004-11-30

Absolute power has dire effects on human relationships. You will learn many of the personal details of the lives of Stalin and his henchmen. You will observe so much pathology that led to the ruin of millions of lives by a small group of men.<br /><br />Stalin's court was evil in so many ways. There were no checks and balances to stop the evil. Both the absolute power and the lack of any mechanisms to put a stop to it are chilling and terrifying.

It is not too long and contains about 4 true life mysteries. You will learn alot about the adventures of deep sea diving. That part of the book is thrilling in much of the same way as the great books that I have read on climbing Mt. Everest. But this book is more because of the mysteries. What is more than 200 feet underwater in deep ocean? How did it get there? Why is it so difficult to get there? Why does it take so many years?<br /><br />One more thought, if you get an audio book, be sure you get an unabridged version. You would not want to leave anything out of this true story.	2004-11-18

He is innocent to a very high standard. He is innocent beyond a reasonable doubt. He was innocent by our legal standards even before his exoneration by the DNA test. As you read the book you will learn that Kirk Bloodsworth was never at any point in the ten year ordeal  guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In spite of this fact he was put on death row when he had nothing to do with the crime.<br /><br />Our best protection in the system is that guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Yet, in this case the prosecution, the judge and the jury ignored this protection. Kirk was never at any point proved to be quilty beyond a reasonable doubt. His conviction was obtained primarily by very imperfect eyewitness testimony that never reached the stardard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<br /><br />This is a very important book that everyone should read. It is such an important message for all citizens that it is almost wrong not to read this book. Kirk Bloodsworth was brutalized for a crime in which he had no connection by a justice system paid for with your tax dollars and little or no accountability for the horrible errors that it made against Kirk Bloodsworth.<br /><br />Also read Mill's review (#11). It is well done.<br /><br />Feedback welcome:<br /><br />George<br />knowledgebooks@snet.net	2004-11-13
