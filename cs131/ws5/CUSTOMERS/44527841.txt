The characters are Tom, a Navy seal specializing is counter terrorism home on medical leave visiting his uncle, and Kally, a big-city doctor caring for her terminally ill father. Sounds like a typical match for a romance novel, but this novel is so much more than that. Kelly and Tom have a past, but her father and his uncle has an even bigger past. All four of them have to draw on their pasts to protect the futures of themselves and many others. Many long kept secrets must be bared and all their hearts must mend.<br /><br />I think I have yet another author to add to my favorite list. This novel not only has a suspenseful, gripping plot, but is packed with romance, and excitement on many levels. Most romance novels are only about two people with various cameo appearances by several others. Not so, with this one. There are four different stories wrapped eloquently into one novel, and expertly blended to create the whole. The reader is kept guessing and there are surprises around every turn. Some are pleasant and some sad. This is truly a moving tale on all levels. You won 't be disappointed.	2005-08-10

True, this isn't usually the type of book I read, and that may be the reason why it took me so long to get into it. I found it hard to follow the story at first.

It isn't what she expected, in fact, it doesn't seem to be any fun at all.<br />Ms. Cleary's Ramona books are a fun read full of humor, but she never neglects to address the problems that really face school age children.  As a child reading these books I remember that it helped put things into perspective for me, although at the time that probably wasn't the word I used.<br />I would recommend this book to all children, and even to adults with children.	2003-12-11

Thank you to Ms. Roberts for a wonderfully written series with three very different women.  This book is a great conclusion to the Stars of Mithra series.  <br />Grace is believed to be dead, but she isn't.  Police Lieutenant Seth Buchanan now has to try and keep her alive as the person who killed her cousin by mistake is still trying to get her.  <br />The characters in this novel could be real, and that makes this novel even more enjoyable.  Ms. roberts has a talent for describing feelings in a way most can't.  You will feel what the characters feel.  Don't miss this dramatic conclusion.  It will keep you guessing about one thing or another right to the end.	2003-10-08

Keep in mind that there is some character cross over from a previous book of Ms. Garwood's (Mercy), but even if you haven't read it you will still be able to follow along easily.<br />This was a tough novel to put down.  It kept me on the edge of my seat trying to guess what would happen next in the saga of Avery and John-Paul, as well as Aunt Carolyn and Monk.  This isn't a traditional romance, nor a traditional suspense novel which made it a wonderfully quick and entertaining read.  The characters could easily be real life, and the comic relief that was scattered throughout the book was delightful.  This is one that I feel just about anyone would enjoy.	2003-10-08

However, I enjoyed this book tremendously.  <br />The characters were real, and true to life.  This book painted a picture of a very fast moving romance between two people.  It showed how many things can go wrong, how hard communcation could be, but how important it has to be.  <br />For a short novel it was wonderful.  Maybe I would have liked a little more character developement, but it really didn't detract too much from the story or the out come.	2003-10-08

I was at a very low point in my life, and was probably close to making a rash decision that I would regret later.  This book has taught me that I am not defective, and that I have more control over me and the events in my life than I thought.  To some this book may be a rude awakening, but it is an awakening well worth it.  I would recommend it to everyone, not just those at a low-point in their lives.

It held my attention from beginning to end.  It made me laugh, it made me hang on to the edge of my seat, it had some truly romantic scenes that made me want more, but it never once compromised the story line.  This is a powerful novel that outlines the wonderful qualities of human nature while fighting some of the worst qualities of human anture.  The characters are believable and very easy to relate to.  Possible made for TV movie anyone?  Although I could see it happening, I wouldn't want to see it happen as I am sure it would loose something.

I am one who couldn't get into it. Hawthorne gets off of the topic often and takes forever to accomplish the discription of something I felt most writers could have done more quickly and more succesfully. All of the discription seemed excessive and only confused me. I had to force myself to read the first half of this book, and by the time I had reached that point I came to the conclusion that if it hadn't already captured my attention then it wasn't going to.<br />I have always enjoyed early American literature, Greek literature, and have read my fare share of William Shakespeare, but I just couldn't enjoy this one. It was just too dry, and the story really seemed to go no where.  I really couldn't recommend this one to anyone as a good read.	2003-06-04

I picked this book up at the grocery store from the sale bin for 50 cents along with many many others.  Usually any book that has a cover dipicting a possibly erotic nature I don't bother with, but I thought I would take my mother's advice for once and not judge a book by its cover.  I was not dissapointed.  This novel actually has a story line.<br />Glorianna and Johnny have known each other since childhood, and because of a wrotten turn of events they are seperated for five years.  Upon Glory's return to her home she is faced with trying to peace her life back together with the help of a partner in her ranch, who turns out to be Johnny.

This is the first of Ms. Garwood's Novels that I have read, but I am a new fan and it won't be the last.  I was moved by Garwood's ability to show her hero as a strong warrior, but to also paint her Heroine as a warrior as well.  Elizabeth is strong willed, and determined.  I also found it a blessing that Ms. Garwood lets her characters be truer to life.  To see a couple who are willing to fight publically and shout is rare in a novel of this time perior, but I h ave no doubt that it happened, even if rarely.<br />There was a great number of ocassions where teasing and humor is present in the book making this one very enjoyable.  The love scenes are tactful, and well written.  The reader can tell that there si lvoe and passion there, and that neither character is shy, but the reader won't spend the entire time blushing.  <br />This is a wonderful novel that is a sure page turner.	2003-05-27

Living off the the land, and avoiding the white man and his world.  <br />This was a very well written book, and enjoyable, but I spent much of my time wondering what the main character Thomas Black Bull was hoping to accomplish.  Regardless, it is a story I would recommend to anyone as it gives a peak into a different culture, and exhibits the importance of obeserving a heritage, but also of the human ability to adapt to circumstance.	2003-05-23

I remember loving her ability to retell an ancient story with accuracy while using her artistic license to add a new character and making it very entertaining.<br />All L'Engle fans should be sure to read this one, and those who aren't should as well.

This is a very entertaining and moving tale of how badly love can go wrong, and how quickly love can make it all right again.  I truly loved this novel.

It takes a very long time for the both of them to realize just how much they love each other, and because of their stubborn pride, and they constant misunderstandings their love almost doesn't come into being.  They both fight to keep their current lives under the control they feel they need, and struggle to stay apart from each other as if they know that in some way a life together would bring an end to all that they had promised themselves.  <br />I found myself wantnig the best for both characters and scolding them for being so stubborn, but with that in mind I can never doubt Ms. Martin's ability to make a character true and believable.

Lucretius saw into the future in a manner of speaking, and was able to elaborate on physical objects being composed of smaller objects he called atoms.  He also touches on many other items with an acuracy that is unbelievable when one considers that scientific advancement has only recently made the tools contributing to the proof of these theories readily available.  <br />Another striking characteristic of this work is that unlike practices in today's society, Lucretius also has his own theories and beliefs on religous matters, and incorporates these along with his scientific view of the world and how it works.  (Religion is rarely even mentioned today in scientific papers.)<br />I enjoyed this work a lot more that I had thought I would.  The translation has made it easy to read and comprehend.

Of course, the Murray children can't just waltz in and snatch up their father.  First they must battle the evil being known as IT.  IT is a very frightning thing that is described as a disembodied brain who offers people complete security if they will give up their freedom and their individuality, and become just as the others on Camazotz have.<br />This book contains some of the most beautiful descriptions of human life, and expresses the ability of even younger folk to change the world, and to do it one step at a time.  It also shows how storng the family unit is, or must be.  This book conveys a worthwhile lesson about the human condition and is great fun to read. It will be a classis in children's literature.	2003-03-11

Thomas More is a wise, brave and educated man who was executed by orders of Henry VIII, and wrote Utopia more as an explanation of why society needed to be far from perfect in order to be enjoyable. Utopia, meaning in Latin \\"in no place\\", was written entirely in satire, and many have said that it was a great source of entertainment for the more educated as they watched those less educated argue on the side of a Utopian state while quoting Moore, and having never seen the satire present while reading. Mr. Moore's Utopia touches on every aspect of the human existance as it would be experienced if we prescribed to this way of life.  I found many of his discriptions colorful, and commonly found myself of the verge of anger before realizing that Mr. Morre was more often than not simply playing the devil's advocate.<br />This was very enjoyable for me.  I would recommend that everyone take a risk and read this one.	2003-03-11

Through the use of her characters she is able to lead the reader into the world as it was in that particular time and place. She is a talented story teller who uses colorful description to create &#34;real&#34; characters to tell her story.<br /><br />Emmanuelle de Beauvais, a widowed single mother and a woman who goes against the social grain of the time by quietly practicing as a doctor, hates the Union forces who have occupied New Orleans. Zachary Cooper, a Union provost marshal, is called to investigate a murder in which Emmanuelle is not only the only known witness, but also the prime suspect. Emmanuelle while knowing she is a suspect, and trying to answer all of the questions Cooper throws at her without giving away too much of her own past and identity has questions of her own. The biggest being whether the arrow that killed her colleague and friend had actually been meant for her. Her fear intensifies when other friends, also associated with the hospital, are murdered. Of course this only makes Cooper view her as an even stronger suspect.<br /><br />Proctor uses a few phrases a few times to many, but despite this she is in top form. This novel has it all. Romantic involvement that isn't your run of the mill variety, coupled with characters you can love, respect and believe in make this a must read.	2003-03-07

The Symposium recounts a debating party held at the home of a well-known poet of the times who was entertaining other well-known celebrities. All of those in attendance take turns flaunting their intellectual prowess by making speeches on love. The Phaedo presents a discussion held in a prison cell where Socrates is being held shortly before his death. Accordingly immortality is the focus of the discussion.<br /><br />I find it interesting that although many things have changed over the centuries, many things also have remained the same. Mankind is still struggling to answer questions regarding immortality and sexuality. While we may have better scientific answers to many things in modern society, we haven't progressed very far in the psychological aspect of things.	2003-02-27

The head of her new family is a heartless grandmother, her sister is Clara Sue, and her boyfriend Phillip is now her brother.

This of course is a timeless classic and a perfect example.<br />This tale deals primarily with Siegfried's life, and his death at the hands of his wife's family. It also deals with the revenge exacted by Siegfried's wife, Kriemhild. The tale is set in the high Middle Ages, and the heroes, as they are in all works of this time period, are supposed to exemplify chivalric values.

It was almost instantly obvious that this was not going to be a typical book, and although I have always loved Barbara Michaels writing style I was releived that she could be original and unpredictable.  There was humor, suspense and the story built as it went.  Just when you thought you couldn't possibly be shocked any further, Ms. Michaels threw a curve at the ending.<br />The characters of Bea, Roger, Father Stevens, Kevin, were all very real, likeable, and interesting. Throughout the book, the suspensese became more intense, the humor climaxed, and the author threw in wonderfully fascinating bits of history.  There was even some conflict between the various characters and their religious beliefs.  This novel keeps you guesing all the way to the end, and then drops a surprising bombshell.

The style flowed easily, and the author quickly painted a perfect picture of the character by using the language that had no holds barred.  It is because of this language that I have to agree with a reveiwer who said &quot;Salinger is subtle, and yet wonderfully blunt&quot;.  <br />I was also impressed with how the author developed his  character, and never strayed from the foundations he a laid.  Not once did Holden seem unlike Holden. <br />The Catcher in the Rye is a classic. Salinger so perfectly put himself into the shoes of an angry and depressed teen that it's almost impossible to think that anyone but Holden actually penned the novel.  It is also no wonder that this novel has become required reading in many schools, irregardless of the complaints from parents not approving of the language the author has chosen.<br />I have never regretted having been forced into the reading of this book in high school.  In fact, I have a new found respect for any schoo lthat reequires it's reading.  It was nice for me to have been able to read a novel that proved I wasn't alone.

Steinberg has written a powerful book that will touch on very sensitive emotions as you follow the character George and Lenny through a short section of their lives together.  The relationship between Lenny and George is related to the reader almost entirely through dilouge, allowing the reader to provide much of their own interpretations.  Their relationship is the basis of the novel, and is only further developed through the use of other, very animated characters.<br />This is not an action packed adventure, or a steamy  romance, or even a suspense filled mystery, but instead a story of a very simply kind of love between very simple characters looking only for a simple existance.	2003-02-24

Mark Twain has done a spetacullar job creating the character of Huck Finn. Huckleberry Finn is developed into a wonderful character, and the book is full of many elements of high drama, starting with Huck's escape from his wicked father, and going on to a series of adventures with the runaway slave named Jim. Along the way, he meets an assortment of memorable characters, including a murderous feuding family and a couple of con men. He even gets to meet up again with his old friend, Tom Sawyer.  All of these characters have a lesson to teach or a moral to show the reader.  You won't realize it though, which is one of the main reasons the story still remains enjoyable.<br />This book has a long history of being banned in schools because of its depiction of Jim, as well as the liberal use of the \\"n\\" word that will always make my skin crawl, to describe African Americans. However, reading of the book will quickly show you that the author had a deep rooted dislike for slavery and the treatment of African-Anericans during his lifetime. Why else would the character Jim keep his dignity throughout while the white men are shown as cruel and or foolish? The character of Jim also shows that he has a big heart and the reader cannot help but want his story to end well.  Jim is only one of the characters that I mentioned earlier that will teach the reader without the reader being aware.<br />I loved this book much to my surprise and found it very hard to put it down. If a person reads nothing else in life but one or two books, this should be one of them.	2003-02-24

Her father, Atticus Finch is a well-respected lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson. <br />Aside, from the obvious theme of prejudice the author has also created a mysterious character that is the center of intrigue to the population Maycomb. The purpose of this character, who is Boo Radley, is unknown to the reader and to both Scout and her brother Jem.  They become obsessed with him and won't give up their struggle to discover his true identity, aluckily for the reader they do.  This mysterious character ends up playing a very important role in the outcome of the novel.<br />Regardless of age, this novel will touch people on a personal level.  It will make the reader think and xplore the ramifications of hate and discrimination.  At least this will be the case if there is to remian the hope that racism, predjudice and discrimination will someday be irradicated.  This is a nvael that has a lot to teach if only the reader is willing to listen.	2003-02-24

This is a play that is based on the Salem Witch Trials, and I have heard that acutal quotes have been taken from actual trial transcripts in its writing, but I haven't delved into the actual transcripts to find out for myself as of yet.  It is because of the historical nature of this play that I enjoyed reading it.  Although the spoken language that is used by Miller for his characters is eloquent it may make this a difficult read for some.  I didn't find it as hard to follow as the language used by Shakespeare, but there a few times that I had to re-read a line here or there. <br />The plot is surprisingly clever and gives the reader the idea that this could very well have been how it happened. The author's ability to touch on every aspect of the experience is truly moving.  The writing is brilliant and I was engulfed in the tradgedy caused by the horrors of life in Salem during this time period. There are numerous moments filled with tension, and I found myself hoping for the best for all of the wrongly accused. <br />This is novel that points out the cruelty of human nature when survival is a person's only concern.  It also points out the level of hysteria a population can reach.  If a reader doesn't take those two lessons away as learned, then perhaps they will take the simpler lesson that is rarely touched upon away with them.  Be kind to your neighbors as ou never know who will have the next profound effect on your like.	2003-02-24

This was the first John Sandford book I have read, and I have to totally disagree will all that say this is a stand alone book.  It does quick well alone, and now that I know there are others in the series I will go back and read them as well.<br />Lucas Davenport chases a serial killer through this novel who has more fashion sense then conscience.  His only leads in the beginning are some poorly (at least in the eyes of the art community) sketched drawings of the now deceased women, and a huntch or two.<br />The character of Lucas Davenport feels very human, and his creator leaves you no choice other than to admire him for his skill as a detective, his sense of right and wrong, his ability to do what he thinks is right no matter what the cost, and his pateince with life as it throws one curve after another his way.	2003-02-19

Not only that, but she has a twin brother that she didn't know existed. After confronting her mother she learns all of this is true.  Samantha decides to meet her brother and her biological father against her mother's better judgement. Enter Agent Nathan McLean, and let the fun begin.<br />This novel is fast paced, and will have no trouble keeping your attention. There is of course a whirl-wind romance as is Ms. Potter's trade mark.  I am usually a big fan of her historical romances, but wasxn't dissapointed on reading this novel.  Twisted Shadows shows all of the talent Ms. Potter has.	2003-02-19

This novel touches on serveral important topics such as prejudice, love, and survival. <br />This novel takes place during the years of World War II.  11-year-old Phillip Enright lives with his parents on the island of Curaçao.  When the war becomes too close for comfort, his mother decides to travel with him back to Virginia in hopes of finding safety.  It is on the journey to Virginia that their boat is torpedoed.  Phillip is one of only a few known survivors, and  is blinded during the sinking of his ship.  He soon finds himself adrift on a life raft with an old black man named Timothy and a cat.  They eventually land on a deserted scarap of land much too small to be called an island (hence the name Cay). <br />Phillip is suspicious of Timothy, but as they suffer through the hardships they must face he soon grows to trust and to later love Timothy. <br />This is a truly remarkable book, and leaves small wonder as to why it is now required reading for school children.  I find it benificial to all ages myself, and would recommend it to anyone.	2003-02-10

I enjoyed it throughly, and would recomend it as a well written book although I had a bit of difficulty swollowing the actions of the main character concerning her husband.  I thought her way of handling her husband's life altering injury set her up for a long line of bad choices. I spent my experience with this novel yelling at her for being dumb, and I am sure that took a bit of the enjoyment out of it for me. <br />I could almost understand why she kept her husband's injury and the reasons it occured from her son, but I didn't understand why she hid her husband from her son entirely. I was equally puzzeled at her dicission to pursue romantic envolvment with another man that she would never be willing to marry until her current husband died. If her love or feeling of comitment was so strong towards her husband than the question of another romance shouldn't have enve come up.  <br />Maybe the author was trying to show something to her readers regarding human nature and morality that I just wasn't able to see.  I must say that altough I had terrible feelings about most of the dicisions that the main character made I wasn't dissapointed in the way the sotry was written.  It kept my attention throughout even if it also kept me atagonized.	2003-01-10

The road to success and happiness isn't always easy, and not always the same road.  It is also a question of how many can stand the tests along the way.      A must read!  This is a remarkable story full of history, adventure, suspense and romance.  Kat is an enjoyable character.  She is strong despite what she is faced with, and the author's ability to paint her portrait as well as those of the other characters in this book is remarkable.      I truly enjoyed this book from cover to cover, and have nothing but praise for the author who knew the history of the era and place the novel was set in, as well as how to portray it all in a very convincing and capturing manner.	2002-12-27

The book was so well written you quickly become attached to the characters and fall in love with them. You find a continuation of events from previous novels accompanied by new developments.  This of course leaves you wanting more.  It is for all of these reasons that I loved the book.<br />I hate this book for only one reason, and it directly correspondes with my fast growing love for the characters and how and when King Javan's Year comes to an end. A must read, but be prepared for tears.	2002-12-27

I fell in love with this book the first time I read it a few months ago and have since read it twice more. A beautiful love story filled with the pain of two people who only find hapiness in each other, but have to struggle to overcome social boundries in order to be together.  Dare I mention that this novel has a fantastic ending?  Don't worry.  So many surprising and exciting things happen before you make it to that fantastic ending that you won't be able to put this one down.	2002-12-27

It found that it was very well written, and presented, and I truly had a hard time putting it down.  I did have trouble however trying to figure out why Katherine Kurtz went this direction with the characters.  I found all that happened very interesting and captivating, but the events seemed so out of place when compared to the path taken in earlier books.  I am not dissapointed, just surprised.  It felt as if the characters left their usual way of life and went on an african safari postponing everything else.  Even taking all of that into consideration Ms. Kurtz has kept her amazing ability to write intact.  Her characters are still believable, and her development of them and the plot are captivating.	2002-12-27

Kartherine Kurtz has always had a knack for making her characters real and loveable, and this novel is no exception.  Her character development and description is simply amazing as always.    The story outlines Gwynedd's growing difficulty with their Torenthi neighbor, and the threat that an illigitimate heir to the Torenthi throne poses.  The ending is a shocker, especially since Mrs. Kurtz has a goal of always keeping her readers guessing.  She has reached her goal yet again.  It is my hope that the story will continue even further yet.	2002-12-27

I hope that this won't be the end of this generation of characters in the Deryni series.  All of Ms. Kurtz novels feature main characters of strong moral value, and this is not an exception.  This is a novel full of the usual well written and thought out scenes, and strong charaters.  It is, as are of her Ms. Kurtz books enjoyable and believable.  It has a good number of surprises as well, and it's own fair share of suspense and intrigue.  The charaters struggle and risk all they have for what the feel is the greater good.  They stop at nothing to do what is right, and accomplish it while attempting to hurt as few others along the way as possible.  this is a page turner of a book.  It won't dissapoint.	2002-12-27

For such a twisted \\"love\\" triangle I throughly enjoyed Mrs. Rogers work, and I really didn't want this novel to end.
