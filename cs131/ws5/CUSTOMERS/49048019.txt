Set up in alphabetical order the text offers it's information in synonomous dictionary style.  Example: (p.199) \\"Melee:  A 'mix-up', or hand-to-hand fight in the lists between teams of knights.  Though they were usually friendly contests, accidents were not uncommon....\\"<br /><br />I rate this unusual and interesting tome at five stars for uniqueness and useability.  I recommend it heartily for any student of history and chivalry.  Superb!	2005-06-09

Author Friedman's use of the modern vernacular \\"flat-world\\" means that \\"flat\\" is \\"connected\\" and the world has shrunk to a size of minutiae as the global business distance can be spanned almost immediately by the average person.  The proposition is posited that the connection between the lowering of trade and political barriers (GATT, NAFTA, etc.) and the exponential technical advances of the digital revolution have made it possible to do business, or almost anything else, instantaneously with billions of other people across the planet.<br /><br />Though instant communication is not news to anyone, the hypothethis that Friedman has to deliver is that just when we stopped paying attention to these developments is when they actually began to accelerate to the detriment of the Western World, particularly the United States.<br /><br />Author Friedman calls the new business paradigm \\"Globalization 3.0,\\" and it is being driven not by major corporations or giant trade organizations like the World Bank, but by techno-savvy individuals such as desktop freelancers and innovative startups all over the world, such as in India and China, \\"who can compete not just for low-wage manufacturing and information labor but, increasingly, for the highest-end research and design work as well.\\"<br /><br />Author Friedman presents troubling statistical data concerning the United States' inability to keep pace with the demand for hard science trained professionals and the lack of social infrastructure to insure that America remains the world's leading source for technological research, development, and engineering.  As a reader, if you wanted to gather a current future assessment of where the United States and the Western World are possibly heading, this book is then a must read.  I rate this text at five stars.	2005-06-09

The subject of author Noel Barber's vast, astonishing, and brilliantly readable work of history, \\"The Sultans,\\" is the bizarre story of the Ottoman Empire as seen through the lives and actions of its Sultans, with their absolute power and terrifying cruelty, their love of pomp and magnificence and their overwhelming venality and corruption.<br /><br />In this detailed tome, The men, the events, the daily life and the strange customs of the Turkish court are described in vibrant detail.  The text begins from Turkey's emergence as a great power in the Sixteenth Century and through the centuries to the death of Kermal Ataturk, who overthrew the Sultanate to establish a new and more modern form of government.  This book is a unique and fascinating record of four centuries of glory, debauchery, splendor and cruelty.  This book will not disappoint the interested reader.

Although the content of the book bespeaks his conservative perspective, it simply feels like the book is just a codification of excerpts from his radio program.  I found the content of the text to be suitable and well within the parameters of the talk radio-television host genre.<br /><br />However, I rate the text at three stars for providing accurate information (as substantiated by footnotes) and for content.

Stewart creates a regaling story for the reader with a compelling narrative of the 1980's Wall Street era of greed and glory.<br /><br />Stewart takes the reader into the lives of the big players on the Wall Street court at the time: Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, and Martin Siegel among many others.  In great detail, Stewart provides the full story of the insider trading scandal that nearly destroyed Wall Street.  Stewart also shows how these \\"players\\" created a series of security scams that made legitimate trading pale in comparison.<br /><br />Equally as intriguing is the story of the SEC detectives that brought the rampant illegal trading to a screeching halt.

Karnow has filled the pages of his book with fresh revelations drawn from secret documents and from exclusive interviews with hundreds of participants on both sides of the \\"conflict.\\"<br /><br />The central theme of the book is that America's leaders, prompted as much by domestic politics as by global ambitions, carried the United States into Southeast Asia with little regard for the realities of the region.  The Truman administration first set America's course in Vietnam by supporting France's futile effort to reimpose its rule there as a barrier against Communism; then Eisenhower pledged the nation to South Vietnam's defense; John Kennedy and his aides deepened the American commitment by their complicity in a plot that led to the assassinationof President Ngo Dinh Diem; Johnson sent in hundreds of thousands of American troops; Nixon and Kissinger, finally, made the concessions that led to the Communist victory they had for so long, and at such a high price, hoped to prevent.<br /><br />This book is a historical treasure by way of unflinching and accurate narrative.  For example (p.302): \\"The crackdowns on the Buddhist temples in August had been carried out by Colonel Tung's special forces on orders from Nhu.  But General Dinh, who approved of the raids as Saigon commander, claimed credit for them, boasting that he had rescued South Vietnam from Buddhists, Communists, and 'foreign adventurers,' his transparent euphemism for Americans.  'I have defeated Henry Cabot Lodge,' he announced.  'He came to stage a coup d'etat, but I, Ton That Dinh, have conquered him and saved the country.'\\"<br /><br />What a great book.

Yet in ruse and strategem the record of Scipio's battles is even richer (p.253).\\"<br /><br />Author Basil H. Liddell Hart has created a wonderful story outlining the history and exploits of possibly the greatest general of any military force, Scipio Africanus.<br /><br />Publius Cornelius Scipio was born in Rome in 235 B.C.; his first recorded taste of warfare was at the battle of the Ticinus, where Hannibal first clashed with the Romans after his famous passage through the Alps with his elephants, and in which Scipio's father was the commander.  Here the 17 year old Scipio saved his father's life, and only two years later, the year of the Romans' disastrous defeat at Cannae, he was already the equivalent of a Colonel.  In 210 B.C. the dynamic and charasmatic young Scipio was put in supreme command; Ticinus and Cannae were the only scenes of failure Scipio witnessed, for in command he never lost a battle.  In three years he destroyed Carthaginian power in Spain and on his return to Italy pressed for a direct attack on Carthage.  Made consul, he took his forces to Africa where he destroyed the forces of Carthage's great ally, Syphax.  Two years later he clashed with Hannibal himself, annihilating his army in the decisive battle of Zama.  For his triumph of arms, which finally broke Carthaginian power, he was awarded the title of \\"Africanus.\\"<br /><br />At 280 pages, this text is very entertaining and easy to read and understand.

Behe offers a scientific treatise suggesting that the more complex the living organism, the less likely the creature was not of intelligent design or creation.<br /><br />At less than &#60;300 pages, the reader is treated to scientific theorem reduced to explanations in layperson terms.  For example (pp.142-43): &#34;I've used the analogy of snap-lock beads to convey how amino acids and nucleotides are put together into long chains.  To understand how AMP is synthesized, let's think of something like Tinkertoys.  For those readers who are unfamiliar with them, Tinkertoys have two kinds of pieces--a wooden wheel with holes drilled into the rim and center, and wooden sticks that have the same diameter as that of the holes . . ..&#34;<br /><br />By offering up the science of biochemistry to the altar of criticism, author Behe explains that &#34;Biochemistry has pushed Darwin's theory to the limit.  It has done so by opening the ultimate black box, the cell, thereby making possible our understanding of how life works.&#34;  I believe that this text combined with other similar books on the topic will provide the reader with a compelling counter-argument to the notions of evolution, natural selection, and others.

The actions of the warriors of both peoples are portrayed in both a heroic and moral context, and it should be understood that the Mahabharata is a reenactment (allegorical) of a cosmic moral confrontation (by the gods), and not simply an account of the cataclysmic battle.<br /><br />Buck's version of the original is written in a smooth flowing and interesting way and is a good introduction to Dharma, Indian mythology, Hinduism, and the caste system.

For example (p.129):<br /><br />  \\"Our next step was to consider an additional important information source which could give us another perspective on the Apohis-Seqenenre struggle.  Our insight into the events of the sixteenth century B.C. had been developed by a new merging of information drawn from written Egyptian history and Masonic ritual; now the Book of Genesis could be added to the mix because, surprisingly, we found it to be rich in information about this period.\\"<br /><br />The evidence that the authors cite is compelling and creates more provocative questions than answers.

If you cannot or will not read the eleven volumes of The Story of Civilization, but want to be an armchair historian, I suggest you at least read this book!<br /><br />For example (p.44): &#34;Though the Church served the state, it claimed to stand above all states, as morality should stand above power.  It taught men that patriotism unchecked by a higher loyalty can be a tool of greed and crime.&#34;<br /><br />This book is fantastic!  I rate this text as five stars!	2004-09-02

Author Frank Herbert's masterpiece of science fiction, \\"Dune,\\" has earned the bragging rights to be known as one of the premier sci-fi classical writings of all time.<br /><br />If you can get past the commercialism spanning over decades of a board game or two, a movie, a television series, comic books, etc., and read the book objectively with no biases, you most likely will find an unbelievably rich and detailed story that harkens back to the likings of a Greek tragedy.<br /><br />The setting in \\"Dune\\" is far into the future where mankind has warred and has spread out into the universe.  Organized religion still plays a vital role (Orange Catholic Bible, etc.).  The nobility of each habitable planet bicker, plot, negotiate, and war with each other like Renaissance city-states.  The title planet, Arrakis or \\"Dune\\" is a desert planet of sand that is rich in the spice \\"Melange.\\"  Melange allows, when ingested as a narcotic, primarily among other things, the Space Guild to bend space so as to transport personnel and cargo great distances in little time.  The main plot involves two warring Noble Houses that compete for control of \\"Dune\\" for various reasons involving much deceit and treachery.  The protagonist of the story, Paul Atreides, finds himself a sort of \\"Hamlet\\" type of figure who grows physically, mentally, and spiritually to become a Messianic type of figure who controls the desert planet and terraforms it to become habitable (like Earth).  The story is so much more involved than this though! I believe, however, that the sci-fi reader will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I read this book in 1987 after having seen the Dino DeLaurentis movie of the same name a few years before.  Needless to say, I loved it!  This book is the benchmark of the sci-fi genre.  I rate this book at five stars.  A masterpiece!	2004-08-31

In his &#34;The 48 Laws of Power,&#34; Author Robert Greene presents 48 laws or chapters that encapsulate the human psyche.  Greene masterly backs his psychological contentions with historical use or &#34;observance&#34; of the law, and then counters the lesson with a breach or &#34;transgression&#34; of the law.  The reader will understand how the lesson works and how it fails.<br /><br />Although no book, tape, or lecture provides a panacea for every human interaction problem, this text goes the distance to make the reader understand our human psychological realm as to why we do what we do.  From our loftiest aspirations to our most base reactions such as jealousy, Greene has created a masterful text.<br /><br />I have used this book many times and have found that Greene speaks about the ugly truths of our human condition.  For example from the Introduction: &#34;In the world today, however, it is dangerous to seem too power hungry, to be overt with your power moves.  We have to seem fair and decent.  So we need to be subtle--congenial yet cunning, democratic yet devious.&#34;  To a student, never in the real world these sentences may seem boastful or a sham.  To the adult with the job, he or she will understand completely.  It is true.  So, gentle reader, protect yourself and livelihood with the aid of this book.  In fact, this book is so valuable to understanding the shortcomings, foibles and flaws in the human psychological machination that I would rate it eight stars if I could.<br /><br />I could offer more examples, but why?  If you've gotten this far you may need the advice this book has to offer.  The Best!  I rate this text as &#62;Five (5) Stars +++.	2004-08-29

This slight book was compiled by heavy borrowing from U.S. Army Field Manuals and the like.  The illustrations are not real good either.<br /><br />Respecting the fact that the book was written twenty-five years ago when the field of SWAT/ERT, or any other acronym implying \\"police acting as soldiers\\" was generally being formed, I think that the reader can do much better with the many contemporary books written on the subject.<br /><br />I came across this book at a chain national bookseller and paid an exorbitant price for it.  The book simply is not that detailed and runs more like an outline than anything else.  It was obvious to me that the author probably hadn't experienced many \\"SWAT\\" situations to incorporate as examples in the book.  Perhaps that could be remedied now if he chose to update the book with a second edition.  For law enforcement officers or students.  I would stay away.  I rated it two stars for the condensed military leadership and MOUT training references, among others, and for the fact that the author took a chance when the field was young.	2004-08-29

Edward Griffin's book \\"The Creature From Jekyll Island: A Second Look At The Federal Reserve\\" is a most well researched and written historical text.  Griffin presents the background with almost an air of mystery that the reader must peel away, like layers of an onion, to reveal the truth.<br /><br />The book provides, in great detail, the time, place, and manner  in which the groundwork for the Federal Reserve was laid, and more importantly, the reasons why.  Griffin explains why even the name is misleading.  The Federal Reserve is not a federal or governmental administration, and it is not a reserve, such as a  bank.<br /><br />Also provided is great historical detail about the commerce and industry in our nation during the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries.  This book will not disappoint the reader looking to expand his or her knowledge of how the collective financial machinations of our country are run.<br /><br />I read this book during my undergraduate years and once presented the book in defense of a historical argument I had with one of my history professors.  Needless to say the professor looked at my reference (the book is so well researched), acceded to my contention, borrowed the book \\"for his own enrichment\\" and never gave it back!  I gratefully let him keep it so maybe he would soften his ascribed \\"socialist democrat\\" leanings.  Unfortunately I am sans the book this day.  Oh well, we march on.<br /><br />As the topic of Civics is not really taught in public schools, or even required in undergraduate studies anymore, this book will serve to \\"illuminate\\" the reader into the background of how private finances and politics are inseparable.  My only criticism of this text is the highlighted aspect of a government conspiracy at work.  Not that Griffin's arguments have no merit, they certainly do, as Lord Acton so aptly is quoted \\"Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely!\\"  However, the mere aspect of \\"a conspiracy notion\\" is all the extremists on all sides need to \\"debunk\\" a truly great piece of historical research and writing.<br /><br />I rate this wonderful book five stars.

Professor Kennedy has prepared a well written historical text covering the economic change and military conflict of the Great Powers of the world from 1500 A.D. to 2000 A.D..<br /><br />The only part of the text which requires modification is the prognostication of the future of the United States and other \\"great\\" world powers as stated in the last one-hundred pages of the book.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it though, this book is a very good recount of pre-1980 history and should be read, reviewed and analyzed under that premise.<br /><br />For example: \\"Although the United States is at present still in a class of its own economically and perhaps even militarily, it cannot avoid confronting the two great tests which challenge the longevity of every major power that occupies the 'number one' position in world affairs: whether, in the military/strategical realm, it can preserve a reasonable balance between the nation's perceived defense requirements and the means it possesses to maintain those commitments.\\"<br /><br />This book represents a groundbreaking treatise of historical accuracy and is a must have for any student of history.	2004-08-28

It is money well invested!<br /><br />Francis Wellman's \\"The Art of Cross Examination\\" is the undisputed classic text on cross.<br /><br />As Wellman points out on page 24, \\"There is no short cut, no royal road to proficiency, in the art of advocacy.\\"  No truer statement has ever been put to paper.  I first came across this paperback in Law School during mock trials, and have come to rely upon it many, many times especially at preliminary hearings.<br /><br />Although dated (first edition 1903), the author quotes extensively from memorable cases and utilizes them to illustrate both the manner and matter of cross-examination.  Wellman covers the topics of handling perjured witness and the expert, and the importance of sequence and the importance of paying attention to the nature of the psychology of the witness.<br /><br />The aspect of Wellman showing how, and knowing when, to illicit information from the witness is why this book has become famous.<br /><br />Wellman uses many famous (at the time) cases that are very humorous, and also timeless (marital discord in 1903 is marital discord in 2004, for example).  This is a very well written book and I promise that useful \\"nuggets\\" of information will be found.  Well done!  Five stars.	2004-08-28

William Valente's (et. al) \\"Cases And Materials On State And Local Government Law\\" is a fantastic text on the subject.<br /><br />For interested Law Students or the Attorney who needs to know about the subject, this book provides a very clear understanding.<br /><br />The text is filled with a detailed introduction and is proliferated with the landmark cases that shaped the law.<br /><br />Topics include: State & local finance, revenues, borrowing and debt limitations, tort liability, national powers in state and federal relations, state sovereignty, local boundaries, municipal incorporation, state constitutional limitations, preemption, etc.<br /><br />An example of the rich and detailed sources the text draws from is this excerpt(p.19) from the informative introduction to the subject: \\". . . [T]he strength of free peoples resides in the local community.  Local institutions are to liberty what primary schools are to science; they put it within the people's reach; they teach people to appreciate its peaceful enjoyment and accustom them to make use of it.  Without local institutions a nation may give itself a free government, but it has not got the spirit of liberty . . .\\" ---Alexis de Tocqueville, \\"Democracy In America.\\"<br /><br />Everything covering the expanse and scope from \\"home rule charter\\" to the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is covered here.  Great text.  Five stars.	2004-08-28

This is the autobiography of, ostensibly, \\"the greatest swordsman who ever lived.\\"  For those who have knowledge of the sport of fencing, nothing else needs to be said as Nadi is a legend.  For those who are curious or newly initiated into the sport, read on!<br /><br />Nadi's self-styled autobiography is very easy to read and understand.  This does not detract, however, from the smooth storyline and rich detail from the mouth of the Master himself.  While I was reading this book it seemed as if I could hear Nadi speaking the words in narrative fashion, and I quickly became lost in his amazing story.<br /><br />Nadi's story is about growing up the son of a fencing master in Italy.  How he rose to become almost a prodigy in fencing.  He provides many details of his youthful chasings of wine, women, and song, and his fencing challenges in Europe.  An interesting chapter is included on his becoming a French actor.  Nadi describes his coming to America, teaching fencing, becoming a respected Citizen, and fencing advisor to the Hollywood \\"stars.\\"<br /><br />Nadi provides the in-depth detail of his loves, his passion for sport, and of course the infamous European \\"duel,\\" that makes great reading, and as a book, is well worth reading.  The reader will truly be moved, I believe, by the accounts of Nadi's own feelings and sensations he experienced during his exploits.  For fencers this book is a must have!  This book deserves a place in every enthusiast's library.  Unparalleled.  Five stars.	2004-08-25

Know that many fencing instructors consider Nadi to be the consumate Master of sport.<br /><br />Aldo Nadi places his many decades of fencing instruction into text form for all of us to use and enjoy.  He provides the reader with his \\"secrets\\" gleaned through his fencing education, techniques, and learned and natural talents.<br /><br />In this book, Nadi states that \\"teaching fencing is much more difficult than might be generally supposed.\\"  He then launches into a treatise of the history of the sword, the importance of footwork, the lunge, proper attack techniques, parry-ripostes, counterattacks, and much more.<br /><br />I feel that this book is a model of fencing instruction, that is devoted to the sport, nay art, of fencing.  Nadi's insights into the \\"psychology of combat\\" are revealing of the authority to which he speaks through his instructions.<br /><br />The reader will find this text very easy to understand and incorporate into their personal fencing regimen.  For novice or advanced fencers, this book is a must read!  What else needs to be said.  This is a great instructional/tutorial text.  Superb!  Five stars.	2004-08-25

As a student of the \\"Self-Help\\" genre of books, tapes, and the like I came across the title of this text in an obscure martial arts on-line retail store.  I had never heard of this title nor of the author.<br /><br />The write-ups and boastful hype which described the book were too juicy to pass up, i.e.:<br />\\"Cleanse your body from unwanted habits; Learn to accept change and have the courage to try new things; Discover how to perceive and get along with others; Gather parenting skills; Find success and follow your destiny; Learn how your home affects your life; Arm yourself with secret words that will send antagonists running away, leaving you the victor instead of the victim; Uncover how to calm your mind to find the answers you seek; Wake up energized,\\" etc., etc..<br /><br />Having recently received my 1st Dan in a mixed martial arts (MMA) style, I was curious to see what kind of esoteric, \\"held closely to the vest,\\" secret type of martial arts/psychological information that author Master Abruzzi was actually dispensing.<br /><br />so I purchased the book to satisfy my curiosity.<br /><br />Review:  I can honestly tell you that you will reap the price of this book hundreds of times over.  This book is absolutely one of the finest self-help books I have ever read.  There are no secrets.  Only Master Abruzzi stating the obvious and giving you permission to do it.  For example, on Page 93, \\"If you owe someone and apology -- just apologize.  People lose contact with loves ones over words.  What a waste of time.\\"  The genius is in the simplicity.  Abruzzi needs no colorful trappings to disguise his truth.  It is beautiful, almost a work of art.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I feel that this book has the potential to truly \\"change your life,\\" if you desire it.  I read this book and sniffed, snorted, and choked back tears several times.  Author Abruzzi, drawing upon his own life experiences, tells it like it is and like it needs to be said.  What a refreshing experience.  Do yourself a favor and get this book today!  Five stars.  Bravo!xperience.  Do yourself a favor and get this book today!  Five stars.  Bravo!	2004-08-24

For laypeople and philosophical adherents alike!<br />This review applies to the 1974 Fourth Edition.<br /><br />Professor Kaufmann has brought about an easily understood text on the great German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900).<br />Professor Kaufmann breaks his work down into easily understandable \\"chunks\\" of vital information as chapters.  Those chapters encompass Neitzsche's background (Part I); the development of his thought (Part II); his philospohy of power (Part III); a synopsis of his controversial works and philosophy (Part IV); his heritage; and appendixes of \\"supressed manuscripts\\" and four handwritten letters.<br /><br />Kaufmann's develoment of Nietzsche's background progresses through his (Nietzsche's) works such as \\"Human, All Too Human,\\" \\"Ecce Homo,\\" \\"The Antichrist,\\" and \\"Thus Spake Zarathustra.\\"<br /><br />Through excerpts and analysis, a portion of this book is also dedicated to investigating the insanity which gripped Nietzsche in his later years.  Left without much explanantion, however, is the fact that Nietzsche actually believed that he was an incarnation of the ancient Persian prophet (God?), Zoroaster (Gr.) or Zarathustra.<br /><br />This book, although not a complete biography or primer on the subject, fulfills the expectations of the reader and will leave that person with a solid understanding of Friedrich Nietzsche.  I rate this text as five stars.	2004-08-23

Tribe's treatise (Volume I) on U.S. Constitutional Law is worth a look.<br /><br />During my semester studying U.S. Constitutional Law, I looked at some hornbooks and then, after some disappointment, specially ordered Tribe's book.<br /><br />I found the Treatise to be enlightening in many areas of Constitutional Law, inlcluding the levels of U.S. Supreme Court review, and others.  In my opinion Professor Tribe brings a refreshing, different perspective to the issues that appeal to many students, although perhaps not to all.<br /><br />The price may be prohibitive for some, but for the Law Student employed full time, along with many other responsibilities, this may be the break you have been looking for.  This is especially true when you are dealing with professors who love to \\"hide the ball!\\"<br /><br />Considering the high cost of your legal education, I feel this book is well worth the money and would be a welcome addition to any law library.  As an aside, after my Con-Law course was completed and my required paper was submitted (rife with Tribe footnotes of course), miraculously, the Law School bookstore began carrying this book at the professor's request!<br /><br />This book comes highly recommended!	2004-08-20

Author Zinn presents U.S. history through the exacting lens of detailed minutia and many lesser known historical facts.  These facts, as presented, serve to \\"fill in the gaps\\" between the greater or more laudible benchmark events in our brave Nation's past.<br /><br />This book focuses primarily on the contributions, labor, and sufferings of the resident national and immigrant poor.  Professor Zinn paints his prose with great detail to include the significant contributions by early African and Native American peoples.<br /><br />Be forwarned however, this book does not celebrate the national triumphs and victories as traditional historical texts have done.  This book vividly fleshes out the ugly, oft forgotten clashes between the rich and poor, management and labor, and government and citizen.  The details as presented serve to remind the reader that any advantages in standard of living, wages, etc., that are realized by our society today were paid for in \\"blood, sweat, and tears,\\" many, many times over by our collective national ancestors.<br /><br />This text is well worth the money and I heartily recommend it without hesitation or reservation as a necessary part of any home or institutional library.

Author Graham Hancock, through \\"Fingerprints Of The Gods\\" and his other genre specific books, asks the fundamental archaeological questions never before presented for public consideration.<br /><br />This book offers a complete thesis so as to complement, augment, and even change contemporary theories concerning the ancient history of mankind.  If read with an open mind, this book has the potential to spark the research of a new breed of archaeological investigators determined to \\"fill in the gaps\\" of mankind's vague history.<br /><br />This book will absolutely stimulate your cusiosity into the origins of ancient human history.  Hancock's endnotes and research reference notes alone are worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2004-08-20

Patrick Buchanan has compiled a literal sourcebook of contemporary historical insight that will no doubt be interpreted as &#34;on-point&#34; or realized as true.<br /><br />As a political science genre text, the book at &#60;300 pages is easily readable and interpreted without requiring advanced education.  Although it can be read and understood in less than a weekend, it delivers a concise and powerful message to the reader.<br /><br />Right, wrong, or indifferent, the future as predicted in this book is being realized.  Accuracy is checked by many footnotes to references.  What can I say?  A very good book worth reading!	2004-08-19
