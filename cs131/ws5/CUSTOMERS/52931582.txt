She falls in love with an arrogant, brilliant, musician. The Enterprise is on it's way to a planet that is going to be swallowed up in a nebula, unless they can find out why it is growing. The strang creatures on the planet sing all day and all night. Hunters hunt them for the tears they shed when they are killed. The Klingons have an intention of claiming the planet. In the end they all work together and solve the problems. This a good book, but I think Uhura is a little too loose.	1997-10-17

It takes a long time for the crew to find out that they have been turned into giant crabs. The only way to get back to normal is to find the other window and go through it.

I loved this book, it wasn't filled with useless technical jargon. The Rift, is a big 'hole' you go through to get to get to a highly developed planet. This Rift is like the story of Briggadoom, it will disappear and it only reappears every 30 years. You find a love a commadoore and of the head of the planet. They met the during the first time Christopher Pike went to the planet. There is a good portion of historical background, which is very accurate. Spock is shown in both the past with Pike and the future with Kirk. I would recommend this book to eryone, it's worth any afternoon.	1997-10-17

When Sarek leaves, days before Amanda dies, Spock is angry and feels that his father betrayed his mother. In the end they reconcile, but it is hard, very hard on Spock's human half. I really enjoyed this book, I looked into what pre-Spock life was for Spock's parents. I saw how Amanda truly felt at certain moments.

This Novel is pretty much predictable in all senses, and you know, as well as I do, that none of the main characters ever die. Just the ones that are extras. Deana could have died, but she was saved. I don't recommend this novel if you want to read something that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Yet, this novel does keep you slightly intrigued if you let it.	1997-10-15

Pawns and Symbols was a excellent book, not only because of an excellently written story, but because of the history it shows.

This novel is good, in the fact that Uhura must keep the group together, because Checkov gets sick, while they search for a missing science team. It is not that great in the fact that the Kirk/McCoy sections were usually tedious to read. Kirk and McCoy were underwater and yet they couldn't be pushed aside for Checkov and co. more interesting plot.	1997-10-15

I only read bits and pieces of Spock (he's accused of conspiricy) that I thought I liked. The story does have a plot, manical commodoore arresting Spock, and other members for not obeying her orders, then searching for Spock, it's ok, but the boring parts just wasted too much time. It took away from the real story it could have been. Like about friendship and loyalty. It showed loyalty, but not to the extint it could have.	1997-10-15

Spock was portrayed in a way that we hardly ever see him in. He was protecting his niece so that in the future she could marry a Romulan. I'm sure she wasn't that happy about it. Well Spock is good in the book and I liked the way that he softened a little, in regards to Teska. If you like Spock read the book, it might surprise you.	1997-10-15
