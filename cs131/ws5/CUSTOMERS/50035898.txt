Automatic writing is the art of \\"contacting other intelligences through the use of a pen and paper while in an altered state of consciousness.\\" This book answers many commonly asked questions about this divinatory art, while offering many different techniques to make it work for you. McCoy explains the power of the planets, planetary hours, and colours in the zodiac in her chapter on automatic writing and astrology. <br />In the next chapter, one of the most important in the book, the author explains proper methods of breathing, meditation,and the chakras. The next section deals with actually doing automatic writing. McCoy describes many different methods of attempting this art, and offers tips for the event that you don't succeed. Finally, she offers some basic interpretations of some common symbols used in automatic writing. A glossary rounds out the book. <br />All in all, this is a great introduction to a subject often referred to but rarely described. If you are interested in this easy yet accurate form of divination and communication, be sure to get this book as a starting point.	2000-06-06

This is my first year reading it and I must say the horoscopes and information are fresh, exciting, fun to read, and most of all accurate. I will no doubt be buying it every year from now on.<br />The Sun Sign Book begins with an overview of astrology and the zodiac, followed by a glossary and a VERY useful table for figuring out your rising sign. The book then is divided into 12 sections, one for each sign. Unlike most annual horoscope books, this one has every sign so you can have horoscopes for not only yourself but also your friends. Each sign has a table of correspondence, a description of the sign's traits, a horoscope for the year, a yearly affirmation, and then the horoscopes are divided into months. Each month offers a forecast for love, fitness, major changes, finance and an affirmation. Rewarding and Challenging days are also listed. Each sign ends with an action table listing the best times to do various things such as start a diet, end a relationship, ask for a raise, etc.<br />The final section of the book has articles on related subjects, such as predictions for the year, friendship, and personality types. I cannot possibly recommend this book more, it's great and should be acquired by anyone wanting a comprehensive, well-written horoscope.	2000-06-06
US	50035898	RSJN0LEQMAACS	0895948710	246265398	Ghosts, Spirits, and Hauntings	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Another great book by Patricia	Ghosts, Spirits and Hauntings by Patricia Telesco offers a balanced, comprehensive look at the subject, all while remaining fun to read. Trish begins the book talking about souls, final resting places, reincarnation and the cases for and against. The book is scattered with personal accounts from many different people, and also a \\"Skeptical Advisor\\" that provides more sensible explanations for some of these phenomenon. OBE's and NDE's are outlined, with definitions and accounts of each. <br />The next section, The Spectral Register, explains and describes the different types of ghosts, their characteristics and reasons for being the way they are. (EX: angry ghosts may harbor fury toward one who's still living.) False Faces covers other astral beings, such as angels and faeries, who may be mistaken for ghosts. This chapter is well-written and offers a ton of information. The next chapter gives signs of, protections for, and remedies for suspected hauntings. <br />The last chapter, Communicating with the Dead, gives information on channeling, mediumship, Ouija, and other types of communication, giving methods and warnings about each. The appendices cover Spirit Superstitions, Historical Haunts, and a glossary. For anyone interested in a well-researched book about ghosts without sensationalism, Ghosts, Spirits and Hauntings is the book to acquire. I highly recommend it for its comprehensive information, detailed summaries, and healthy outlook.	2000-06-06
US	50035898	RAH2ZXCAFEWHQ	0806517824	971409640	Wicca Love Spells (Citadel Library of the Mystic Arts)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Could've been better...	... but it's interesting. \\"Wicca Love Spells\\" (formerly released as Secrets of Love Magick) includes many spells, charms, and information about the magick of love. She spends some time explaining the secrets of love magick, with notes on feeling, sincerity, and proper timing and visualization. This was very responsible of her to do, as many books do not offer anything for you to consider before doing the spell. The spells themselves, however, fall very flat. Do some go against the Rede? Absolutely, there are spells to attract certain people and to bring an old lover back. But, keeping in mind that not all who read this book will be Wiccan (despite the name) I have not rated lower because of that, just because many of the spells don't seem to be... very practical or do-able. Some require strange ingredients such as your intended's blood (just so easy to get! *LOL*), toenails from a rooster, and an oil lamp made out of the root of a lily. Some spells in this section are to be considered, but some just seem like too much of a hassle to me when there's so many easier ways of doing a love spell. <br />The section on Love Charms fares better, including information on Love Talismans, Magick Squares, and Mojo Bags designed to attract love. The worst part of the book, however, comes next. Although Gerina says that the spells in the Ancient Love Magick section should NOT be done and are only included for curiousity and historical sake, I think it should've never been included at all. Even with that warning, someone new at spellcasting may pick up the book and attempt one of these spells paying no attention to the warning. These \\"spells\\" include pinning a frog bone on your intended's clothing, eating dove's hearts, and drinking the ground liver of a black cat. After this low point, Gerina devotes an entire section to herbs, something she seems to do in every book. Love potions and aphrodisiacs come next, most of which seem simple to do. The section Star Signs of Love is too simple, as it just lists the signs of the Zodiac and what signs are compatible, pretty standard fare if you're familiar with astrology. I would've liked to see her expand this some more, along with the section on Love Palmistry, which seems a bit confusing, almost like it's not explained well enough. <br />My favorite part of the book has to be the listings of the Goddesses of Love, as many are uncommon and she offers some fascinating information. The same goes for the Gods of Love. The section on Love Divination is interesting enough, sadly most of her information is taken directly from \\"The Dictionary of Omens and Superstitions\\" by Philippa Waring. I would've liked to see more \\"actual\\" divination information, such as Tarot spreads or the like, rather than just omens. Gerina's handfasting ceremony is nice and she offers some simple background on the ceremony itself. There's a single page on Love Numerology, but it's useful. The book ends with a glossary and bibliography. <br />Although a lot of different information is crammed into this book, I wish the author would've gone into more detail about some aspects. I also wish the spells would've showed more variation and that some would've been simpler... Some more spells to attract a non-specific lover would've been nice too. Aside from these low points, I found this book interesting to read, and I recommend it to anyone with some basic knowledge already of how love magick works.	2000-06-05

She told me it doesn't get much better than this, and she was right. Linda Goodman offers so much information on each sign it's incredible. She uses many examples to get her point across about certain personality traits and quirks.<br />As another reviewer said, it all depends the most on the exact time, location etc. of birth, but this book offers great generalizations for men, women, children, bosses, and employees. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book. You will no doubt find out a great deal of information about yourself and those important to you.	2000-06-05

What I like the most about this book is that unlike The Pagan Book of Days,  it has something for everyday of the year.  Each month listing begins with  a brief history of the month itself, birthstone, flowers, and astrological  signs.  Each day has a magickal tidbit such as God/dess observance days,  festivals, birthdays, or history.  The illustrations are beautiful and give  the book an almost &quot;medieval&quot; feeling.  For the record, there are  NO spells or rituals in this book, but there is a wonderful poem by Dunwich  at the front of the book.  If you are interested in history and want to  know more about ancient Pagan festivals and when they were observed, get  this book!  You won't be disappointed.  Blessed be.	2000-06-05

I found this book very complete and informative about a man I admire deeply and whose work helped lead me to the path I follow today. Most of all, it showed how Scott was human like the rest of us. He was humble, loved the Goddess deeply, and wanted his work to be the best it could possibly be. The recounting of his death is particularly touching and handled well. <br />A section of photographs show Scott at various times in his life including photos of Hawaii, a board game he created, and his books. The book ends with the complete text of his booklet \\"A Formula Book of Magical Incenses and Oils\\", a complete list of his writings, Cunningham's astrological chart, and notes from one of his workshops. If you are a fan of Cunningham's work, do yourself a favor and pick this book up to learn more about this great man and his life.	2000-06-05

I have always been fascinated with mystical creatures, but unfortunately very few intelligent books have been written about them. I'm glad to say this book is great! It covers a lot of ground, offering information for each creature, and also advice for working with them.<br />Conway begins with an introduction to the concept of mythical beasts, and a general overview of working with them. The book is then divided into sections for each type of creature, as follows: Unicorns, Flying Horses, Centaurs, Satyrs and Fauns, Gigantic Birds, Human-Birds, Griffins, Mystical Bulls, Fabulous Lions, Magickal Serpents, Sphinxes, Hell Hounds, Water-folk, Creatures of the Stony Stare, Gargoyles, and other creatures. Each chapter has many different types of creatures that fall under that heading, such as Woodwose under \\"Centaurs\\", and Nixies under \\"water-folk\\". For each creature a description, area, origin, and folklore are given, followed by psychological attributes and magickal attributes. The many illustrations are delightful and detailed. The final part of the book deals with working with magick, and covers candle burning, amulets and talismans, and rituals. These chapters are brief, but Conway gets right to the point. <br />In the \\"Rituals\\" section, she offers three different quarter calls and dismissals, for the Archangels, Lords and Ladies, and the Elemental Kings.A wonderful book that anyone interesting in magick or mystical beasts can enjoy greatly. Even if you are not into magick or paganism, you can still delight in reading about the folklore and legends about these magickal mythical mystical beasts.	2000-05-28

Silver begins with the basics of magick, written in her warm, friendly voice. She explains how long a spell should take to manifest, manifesting and banishing energies, timing and astrological correspondences, why magick doesn't always work, and staying away from \\"black\\" magick. Such basics should always be kept in mind, and Silver does a good job of refreshing our knowledge, or giving a primer to anyone new to spellcasting. Her self-blessing ritual is a nice touch, and her tips on being honest with yourself are also helpful.<br />All throughout the book Silver gives practical, mundane advice and tips for staying safe and maximizing your protection. This is always good, for all spells must be backed up on the physical plane in order to be beneficial. A sampling of such advice: never giving your credit card number or internet passwords to anyone; what to expect when you call 911; and the fact that being angry can be okay, amongst other things. The spells themselves are divided into three well-organized sections: Personal Prevention Magick, Banishing Those Lesser Irritations, and When Things Get Sticky.<br />Personal Prevention Magick covers strengthening one's self esteem, filling one with a sense of responsibility, leading one away from the victim mentality, and putting one in touch with one's personal choice of divinity. Sample spells include: Black Madonna Protection Incense; Dragon's Eye Triangle, which gives suggestions for using this symbol for protection; Penelope's Protection Web to stop fraud; a spell for when your car breaks down; and a house blessing. These spells are very effective and are very simple to perform, many not requiring anything more than the simple memorization of a chant.<br />Banishing Those Lesser Irritations includes spells for eliminating stress; repelling negativity; stopping gossip; nightmares; midnight callers; and liars. These too, are very practical.<br />Finally, When Things Get Sticky covers spells for more serious or complicated matters. These spells include: bringing an animal killer to justice; getting your stuff back; getting rid of a jealous lover; candle magick for court cases; catching thieves and criminals; and working things out. These spells are more detailed and require more attention and focals, but are well worth the extra effort. <br />\\"Silver's Spells for Protection\\" ends with an herbal table, colour correspondences, astrological correspondences, planetary hours, and moon phases. I recommend this book to anyone searching for simple yet effective ideas to enhance protection in their lives.	2000-05-28

It reveals the origins of many modern superstitions such as walking under ladders (The Devil and the Triangle), and such sayings as \\"pinch me\\" (sailors who had spent long periods of time were often mistaken for ghosts when they returned, and so they were pinched to prove they were real). This book is very comprehensive, answering many questions and giving fascinating information. <br />Some more things covered in this book are: birthmarks, chain letters, epitaphs, ladybirds, may blossoms, palpitations, robins, shooting, sodomy, tables, and weeds, among other common and uncommon omens. I highly recommend this book.	2000-05-28

The author himself makes note that it was just casual note-taking that led to this booklet, not a major scholarly work he labored on.<br />The Gods of Man covers deities from the following cultures: African, Aztec, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Japanese, Mesopotamian, Norse, North American Indian, Oceanic, Roman, Santerian, Slavic, South and Central Native American Indian. Each culture has a small sampling of deities, with a brief definition of each. This book is meant more as a dictionary, NOT as large biographies of each deity. I have found info on many lesser-known deities, enough to give me an understanding of who he/she was and what he/she did.	2000-05-28

The book begins with an introduction to the runes, and a brief introduction to Norse mythology. The history of the Runes follows, covering such info as magick, the coming of Christianity, and the Old Norse language. Runes is then separated into Frey's Aett, Hagal's Aett, and Tyr's Aett, with detailed info and an illustration for each rune. The next section of the book deals with Runic divination and Runic Magick. Casting the Runes is described, along with these rune casts: Three-Rune, Six-Rune, Seven-Rune, Cross, Celtic Cross, Sigel, and Peorth. Rune script and bind runes are then explained in detail.<br />Finally, this delightful little book ends with gemstone, flower, and tree associations for each rune. I recommend this book for those interested in the Runes, their history, and many uses.	2000-05-27

The 1997 edition is no exception! The articles cover a wide variety of ground and there is something for every magical background.<br />First, I think I'll start with the bad: Silver RavenWolf has WAY too many articles in here; 21, in fact. I love Silver and everything but that's a bit of overkill. Her articles aren't bad, but some of them could've been compressed into one larger article.  However, most of her articles are good, with the notable ones being \\"Teen Witch: How Do I Tell my Parents?\\" which offers practical and usable advice, and \\"Dream Magick\\", a personal favorite of mine, which offers a technique for getting a message through to someone you cannot reach. <br />D.J. Conway makes some wonderful contributions, including some sweet children's stories and an article on \\"Chaos Dragon Power for Women.\\" Other notable articles include biographies of Dion Fortune, Sybil Leek, and Scott Cunningham; \\"How to Use Planetary Hours\\"; \\"The Island of Pimu\\"; \\"Men and Isis Worship\\"; and \\"Recycling your Jack o'Lantern\\". The illustrations are great and fitting, with more hand-drawn ones in this edition. Poetry is also offered in this edition, with contributions by Jen Besemer and Jane Callard.<br />Highly recommended, I suggest picking a copy up if you can. You won't regret it!	2000-05-27

If I was forced to name one good point about the book, it'd probably be the section on figure candles, although it is pitiful. It covers such candles as Devil, Human, Mummy, Witch, Cat, Cross, Skull, and Snake, and what each can be used for. Altar setup is covered, and then the \\"Spells\\" begin.<br />All the spells in this book have are a picture of an altar setup with the proper candles, oil, incense to use, and then a short affirmation. All the oils and incense are Anna Riva's \\"own\\", which must be purchased at somewhere like AzureGreen. The spells can surely be personalized, but I wouldn't waste my time. The rest of this book covers prayers to the saints, psalms and candles, seals and candles, the hand of glory, and ceromancy. The section on seals offers uses for seals from the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses; unfortunately, the info is so incomplete you would have to go and buy those books just to get the seals themselves. The Hand of Glory is some bizarre medieval spell that she has adapted to make out of clay and use to control another.  All in all, not recommended.	2000-05-27

This book is about as complete as you could get, aside from the exclusion of meat... His explanations are valid however, that red meat hinders psychic development, and many magicians are vegetarians as it is. Aside from that, the book is VERY comprehensive and I have not found much if anything that appears to have been overlooked. <br />Scott begins the book with an overview of the magick in food, and how to harness it. He then divides the next part of the book into chapters for each separate food \\"group\\", such as: fruit, breads and grains, alcohol, eggs, spices and herbs, etc. The history of each food is given, such as where it was discovered, and what peoples ate it the most. Under each section specific foods are given, such as barley and rye in the bread section. Each listing gives the planet, element, energies, lore, and magickal uses. The information is practical and useful, just like the rest of his books. <br />Part III details magickal diets, such as love, money, spirituality, weight loss, and peace and awareness. Here Cunningham gives a listing of foods pertaining to each magickal goal and suggestions on serving each. Finally, even junk food and fast food is covered, for those of us who can't live without it. A table of correspondence and a glossary round out this wonderful, well-written book. <br />I wholeheartedly suggest trying to find a copy because I guarantee it: if you eat, you'll find use in this book. Bright blessings.	2000-05-03

This author seems to rely on secondhand accounts and the book seems more of an attack against non-Christians than anything else.  Yes, this book is definitely written from a Christian viewpoint, and as such is a bit biased. It never even mentions the possibility that such activities may be beneficial, or that practitioners of such things as Wicca are genuinely happy. I personally know no one who has been possessed or driven to suicide because of the board. Read such books at your own discretion, but please keep an open mind; this is not the only view, or the only way.	2000-05-03

I read this book thinking it would have practical information and techniques to develop psychic ability, but such info is scant. Instead, the majority of the book deals with interviews and answers to questionaires filled out by psychics, explaining the art and their own personal involvement. The section on the history of psychics, the spiritualist movement, and the paranormal in the 20th century is likely the most interesting part of the book. It describes a wide variety of authors, works, and people instrumental to the movement and resurgence of spiritualism. The rest of the book describes in detail the responses she got to the questionairre. This is very interesting, especially if you have always wondered how they started, what exactly they do, their religious beliefs, feelings about commercialism, etc. After one reading however, it's probably something you won't feel inclined to reading again. This is not to say, however, that there are not any techniques given; they just have little organization and seem to get lost between the personal accounts. Psychometry, crystalomancy, and palm reading are among the methods covered, unfortunately none of them are mentioned in any great detail or length. \\"Complete\\" is not what I would call this book. <br />The Appendices are the most organized section in this book, and perhaps the most useful. Appendix A gives the complete survey results, including statistical information, personal involvement, clients, and general questions about the field. Appendix B gives a very comprehensive glossary, Appendix C lists many types of divination, and Appendix D details palmistry. Appendix E lists noteworthy psychics and channelers, including Silver RavenWolf and Richard Webster.	2000-05-03

Her book of Cat Spells is a wonderful book for those who love cats, magick, or both :) Most spells only call for something like the discarded fur or whiskers, or the presence of your cat. I recommend it highly.<br />She begins with an introduction of the magickal history of the cat: their omens, worship, and also their torture and torment. Cat Naming Spells come next, with a wide variety of names from folklore and mythology. Spells are given for naming and blessing your \\"familiar\\", or cat that will be working with you in your magickal workings. The next chapter deals with healing spells, such as healing a broken bone or toothaches, to give some examples. I would've liked to see some spells for healing your pets, rather than just humans, but all is alright. Spells for Love and Enchantments come next. These include spells to see spirits, and the loveletter cat spell, where your cat accompanies you on your walk to mail a letter to your loved one.Spells for good luck are briefly covered, and so are weather spells, and then Faery spells are included, which is my favourite part of the book! ^_^ There are only two Faery spells, one being the Northern Lights Faery Spell and the other being the Faery Cordial. All the spells in this book are practical and very workable, given your cat goes along with it ^_^ I would've liked to see more material covered, but there are few other cat magick books so this inexpensive book is definitely worth picking up.	2000-04-30

Instead, what you will find is a deck emphasizing the positive aspects of life to the exclusion of the negative. <br />On to the cards :)The cards have beautiful artwork by a variety of artists, the borders differ on each card, and the backs of the cards are nice as well. It is not just geared towards a certain religion, although Archangel Michael is one of the cards. The cards also include images of unicorns, faeries and gnomes. All 44 cards have their own charm and uniqueness.The booklet covers methods of attunement and dealing the cards, and gives a short description and meaning of each. These meanings are NOT meant to be the final word, as Doreen Virtue says clearly that you will find your own meanings of each card as time goes by.<br />A great deck to use, and a good alternative to Tarot decks, although I think I'll be using this one less than my Rider-Waite :) Great for angel lovers of any religion.	2000-04-29

However, if you are looking for common and not-so-common herbal remedies, then this book may be worth a look, although it is not always accurate. This book is divided into sections pertaining to different parts of the body and different illnesses that one may encounter. Her section on quitting smoking was very helpful for some addicted friends of mine, and one even successfully quit while supplementing her doctor's suggestions with those from this book. I also appreciate the warnings on certain herbs for pregnant women, such as warning that rue can cause a miscarriage. I recommend this book because I feel it is comprehensive, if you look beyond the title.	2000-04-27

Mynne shows the connection between faerie and UFO sightings, describes the Faerie universe and four great seers, then devotes the rest of the book to amazing guided meditations and the complete  Ballad and Romance of Thomas the Rhymer.

Most people view the Tarot as a fun little fortune-telling device and do not take it seriously, and sadly most books on the market share this view. Aleister Crowley certainly was strange to say the least and while not all may agree with his way of seeing things, I believe this book will be of tremendous help to a serious student of the Tarot. Crowley covers every aspect of every card and illustrations are used from the Thoth Tarot which was commissioned by him and painted by Frieda Harris. The symbolism comes mainly from ceremonial magick and the Qabala, and for those unfamiliar with those systems re-reading will no doubt be required, but it is well worth it. Also, knowledge of Crowley's Book of the Law may be desired, because he refers to it frequently.<br />A great asset to those wishing to take their study of the Tarot one step further.	2000-04-27

Amber K's book is a straightforward, no-nonsense book with a great tone and wonderful information.<br />The book is awesome for everyone interested in magick whether they are beginners or not. I still find myself turning back to it whenever I need clarification or inspiration. She begins with an explanation of what magick is and is not, your magickal education and the different magickal traditions. I particularly enjoy the sections on preparing yourself for magick and magick and your health, as a lot of people tend to not realize that your diet really does have an effect. Ritual, raisingpower, and some sample spells are the meat of the book. The spells are simple and effective, and the section on ethics is important and well-handled. The glossary and correspondence tables round out True Magick.<br />I cannot recommend this inexpensive book enough, whether you are starting out on your path or seeking some new angles on magick. I especially recommend this book to beginners before they buy any spell \\"recipe\\" books so they understand the basis of magick and do not take it to be something it is not.	2000-04-27

Otherwise if you are serious, I would suggest getting an actual Ouija Board, which is not nearly as \\"bad\\" as most make it out to be.<br />The set comes with 52 category cards, Ouija Category board, Ouija Answer Board, forecaster, rule booklet, and scorepad. It is meant for 3 people or play, and really doesn't work with less (I've tried; it loses interest quickly unless you have a fairly large group of people). Each category has 26 different answers, but most do not fit very well. Only if you are looking for something not so serious and fun; otherwise pick up a board, be careful, and find a good, comprehensive book on the Ouija.	2000-04-27

I discovered nothing groundbreaking, but I found enough to write another more detailed review.<br />Teen Witch has its good points, but its bad points tend to stick out forcing you to dig for the good qualities. The language used in this book is rather degrading. I am a teen and do not refer to adults as \\"big people\\". The Principles of Wiccan belief do not need to be translated, and some of the spell names have to go. A lot of spells do violate the Rede which 30 pages before she tried desperately to get readers to understand and respect, and some of the teens she uses as examples are rather stereotypical, almost reminding me of the movie \\"The Craft\\". This is enough to make you want to gag, but thankfully the rest of the book fares better.<br />Silver does cover a lot of ground in this book, making it a good first book if one can look past the language. She clears up misconceptions and myths, and offers some basic info on Esbats and Sabbats. There are a lot of lists, with the one on magickal herbs you can find in your grocery store being the most useful for me. Love spells and unethical spells aside, the protection and psychic spells aren't bad and she encourages that you personalise and even create your own spells, a point I always enjoy in a book.<br />So, childish references aside, the book is not that bad of a buy if you are really new to Wicca or just curious. However, Silver should've realized that she did name the book \\"TEEN Witch\\" and that the majority of us are more intelligent than she seems to believe. I would suggest flipping through it first at the store and making sure you will find it useful before you buy.	2000-04-12

The artwork is beautiful and powerful, the meanings empowering, and all in all is a wonderful deck to use for self-empowerment.   I especially enjoy the inclusion of Freyja, one of the Goddesses I work  with a lot.  My only complaint is that the cards are very wide and those with small hands will not handle that well, and that is why I have  taken off one star.

The booklet  explains meanings well and offers a springboard for the reader to form  their own interpretations.  My complaint is that many of the minor arcana  cards are not very original and appear to be taken directly from the  Rider-Waite deck without many modifications.  A good buy nonetheless.	2000-04-12

With that in mind it's refreshing to see a spell book promoting harmony and  happiness, especially in the home, where unfortunately it is oftentimes  lacking.  This book covers practical advice, correspondence tables and  spells for moving in, safety, nurturing and love, health and joy for  grandparents, coziness, healing, and finding buyers.  I especially like the  section on mood shifting for fire, earth, air and water signs.  The last  portion of the book covers spells for holidays - traditional and  &quot;nature&quot; (read: pagan).  I thought the spells for the Sabbats  were very lacking and that's why I took off one star...  However, if you  are looking to bring harmony to your living space, this is a book you  should seriously consider, along with the Magical Household by Scott  Cunningham and David Harrington.	2000-04-10

Although this book seems like a sequel to Spinning Spells, Weaving Wonders, it is different enough  to warrant a purchase.  The first part of the book, &quot;Off to  'Oz'&quot;, answers common questions about magick, such as &quot;does folk  magick have a religious element&quot;, and Telesco offers her own rules of  magick, much as Cunningham did.  Getting started in folk magick is  discussed, as is folk magick fundamentals.  The second part of the book,   the Components, is divided into Traditional and Modern components, and  covers such items as coral, hawthorn, lead, snakes, batteries, blenders,  and more.  These entries are in alphabetical order and include themes,  elemental correspondences, and sample applications.  If you are looking for  practical ways to use ordinary household items in your magickal practices,  this book is well worth the price.	2000-04-10

I picked it up, seeing as how the cover is so nice and the photos are beautiful. The only other love magick book I own is Love Magic by Laurie Cabot; and that remains my favourite love magick book simply because it packs in more information. Beautiful pictures do not make up for lack of substance.<br />Bewitched does certainly have its high points in terms of text; The color breathing section is new to me, and I believe self-love spells are always good to have on hand. The book is divided into six sections, the first being devoted to \\"attraction spells\\"; that is, attracting a nonspecific person who is right for you. Section 2, entitled \\"Two's Company\\", deals with \\"moving flirtations on into the realms of reality\\". These spells are somewhat drab, such as the manicure spell, which calls for mixing your nail filings into your sought-after lover's tea. Mmmm. Refreshing. ;)<br />\\"Three's a Crowd\\" offers solutions for when you cannot make up your mind between two lovers or when you cannot let go of a past relationship. These spells are practical and should help one out, if that is your predicament. If you are looking for a stronger commitment such as marriage, there are many spells to push it along; the next spell section deals with aphrodisiacs and potions for passion; and finally, the last chapter deals with keeping love fresh throughout a relationship.<br />Although Ms. Hardie covers a lot of ground in such a small book, I tend to get the impression that she rushed it a bit. Yes, most of the spells have some sort of nice-sounding authority to them, such as romany traditional spells, but none of them are really groundbreaking or offer any sort of substitution or personalization. If you really need a love spell and/or need to understand the ethics first, I would suggest buying Love Magic by Laurie Cabot or any book by Scott Cunningham, such as Earth Power. This book is wonderful if you already have a firm understanding of love magick, but I would not recommend it as a first book.	2000-04-10

She lists many types of herbs and their qualities, herbs for incense and candle magic, and herbal treatments. <br />Moving on she covers green living, or living your life in a Pagan context. She explains how to cast a circle, runes, divination, and includes recipes for herbal teas and herbal baths. Aoumiel's spells are simple and effective, her Sabbat rituals are beautiful, and she always allows for personalization.

A generation ago, the ancient forests of Walensor swallowed up the young princeling Dart. All the kingdom presumed him dead. But, enclosed in the bark of the oldest tree, Dart was still alive--a human vessel of the trees' greatest secrets ... and most powerful magic. Twenty years later, Dart was released. The trees had given him the most precious of gifts: A wooden sword, a harp, and timeless wisdom. The trees also gave him a great and terrible mission: To save his world from a powerful tyrant, a dark wizard of smoke... and fire.\\"<br />When I began reading this book I could not put it down. Following Berika and her frustration at not being able to reach the Web, her meeting with Dart, and their subsequent journey... this all was wonderful. However, about halfway through the book it began to lose the charm and style of the beginning and I began to lose interest. A good book for fantasy lovers, if you can pick a copy up.	2000-04-07

However,  if you're as stuck as I was at that point, any help is greatly appreciated!   As for FF6, I thought the information was rather skimpy and bare bones,  but if you're new to the game it'll help you out.

This book serves to dispel some common myths about spirit communication (i.e. Ouija,  seances, automatic writing etc.) and teaches you  the reality of the art.  It begins with an outline of the 5 levels of the spirit world and a  thorough discussion of each, then moves on to discuss the history of the  Spiritualist movement and religion.  Buckland offers definitions of many  common terms, such as clairaudience and channeling, and offers advice for  doing each.

The book states it in a way that I never could, so I'll quote you a passage to let it speak for itself: The Devil: ...\\"I close the triangle, the other two sides of which are Death and Time. In order to quit this triangle it is necessary to see that it does not exist.\\" I would suggest this little volume for anyone searching for the deeper meaning of the Tarot.	2000-04-07

Throughout the whole book Trish stresses the importance of respect for our Earth Mother, by offering prayers and charms designed to help her heal and  to help foster more respect for her in the next millenium. Aside from the  Gaia prayers, the second most interesting part is \\"Future Visions,  Ancient Quests\\", a chapter on divination.  It includes omens, scrying,  lot casting, dice casting, playing cards, and divination ideas for  children.

Good; variation makes life interesting. This book certainly does come from a somewhat feminist viewpoint, which will be a turn-off to many readers who do not share that same view. This in itself does not mean that the book is not worth checking out; however I would suggest flipping through and perusing some of the book before purchase just to make sure it will be of some interest to you, because -- as I have stated -- this is not a book for everyone. <br />It covers the author's discovery of witchcraft and her subsequent journeys, covering in detail the people she meets and what happens in the circle; basically, an autobiography. It covers a great deal of her feelings and different things she tried, and although this is very fascinating, at times her writing becomes a bit romanticised and/or dreamy, which detracts a bit. If one is looking for a spell book, this is not the place to look. I personally wouldn't suggest this as a beginning book unless you are looking for a more first person account. Again, it depends on the type of person you are. The appendix does include a couple of spells and a very brief overview of the holidays, but any other spells will have to be picked out of the chapters.  The reason I rate it a bit low is simply because it is not for everyone and therefore is not as accessible as a lot of other good Wiccan books. However, if the idea intrigues you then it will be well worth the money.	2000-03-03

This is, simply, an enchanting fantasy unlike any I've read before. The setting is dreamlike, the characters realistic and the way everything ties together at the end is satisfying.  I've read this book at least thirteen times, and never tire of it.<br />Tristran Thorn's adventure to find a fallen star to win the heart of his \\"one true love\\" follows many paths, all of which are powerful and fascinating.	2000-03-02

One day a disturbing man leaves an old book in her shop, and when he begins to invade her dreams she starts on a bizarre journey into the arcane.  Her friends and family gather psychic forces while Rian finally discovers the Rag Bone Man's identity.  But will she able to harness her own magickal power before the final confrontation?<br />This book has a good plot, full of intelligent and well-researched occult references. The mystery itself keeps you on your toes. However, some choppy sentences, cliches, and weak dialogue here and there detract from the overall enjoyment of the book.  Characterization is also weak.  Despite all this, the book is still worth a read.	2000-02-25

It is written for very young audiences and this is noticable when you first open the book. Silver should know teens have more intelligence than this. The only good parts are the herbal charts and perhaps one or two spells.... There are many better books for beginners, try anything by Scott Cunningham or Laurie Cabot.	2000-02-23

It is not a recipe book like most, but instead gives you props and focals so that you can create your own spells, which  are, of course, the best.  It was my first book on magick and I'm glad I  started off so well.  A must-have!	2000-02-20

There are many, many better candle magick books out there. This one is the scantiest and also most egotistical I've seen. All of the so-called spells require some of her oils and incense, and none of the info is real helpful either.	2000-02-20

It includes spells, oils, incense, feasts, and of course rituals for each holiday.  The rituals are written for coven use but I've found they can be easily  modified to fit solitary practice, as well.  For anyone interested in  Celtic folklore or just the holidays, this is the book to get.	2000-02-20

It differs from traditional tarot decks because it includes the Tree of Life card and four Gift of Faery cards.  It, however, is not for everyone, as it is rather specialized (the Faery  Wicca path) and it definitely helps to have a background in the tradition,  but a beautiful deck nonetheless.	2000-02-19
