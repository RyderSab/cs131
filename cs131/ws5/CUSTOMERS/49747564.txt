The great philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is in a suicidal depression, and his estranged friend Lou Salome seeks to help him out.  In an insightfully imagined meeting between himself and one of the founders of modern psychology, Josef Breuer, the two engage in a series of talks that ultimately leads to the unraveling and subsequent recognition of both their problems.  Only in historical fiction could you hope to get such a close and human portrait of the great thinker and his idea's.  Cannot recommend it enough.	2004-08-28

The Irish did not single handedly save civilization anymore than did Christianity destroy it, although it is largely the Christian bias that he suffers from.  At the end of the book he says: &quot;---if we are to be saved, it will not be by Romans but by saints.&quot;  If it were not for the Romans there would not have been any civilization for the Irish to save in the first place.  Mr. Cahill as well treats his idea as though it were unknown before him, when any student of European history is quite well aware of the contributions of the monastery system of the British Isles in helping to reorganize the west.  As Cahill is an Irish name I wonder that anyone should be surprised by his views.	2003-09-22

Through out this work, Livy readily admits in his own word's: &quot;...the mists of antiquity cannot always be pierced.&quot;  He makes up for the lack of information with lively stories of Rome's foundation and early struggles that sound as though they could come from any High School history book on the American Revolution.  George Washington, who consciously propagated the image, could be seen as a latter day Cincinnatus.  The founding of the Twelve Tables could be likened to the writing of the Constitution.  And at the end you can detect in the speech of Camillus the religious fanaticism of a proto-Pat Robertson, claiming all their victories as due to strict religious observance, and clearing the way towards that sense of self-righteous conviction that would purge the Romans of all guilt in their later conquest's.  Though it is excellent in its telling, (a proof of its power and danger) Livy has created a masterpiece of nationalist propaganda; the foolish, sentimental example of which has still to be learned from after two-thousand years.	2001-06-28

Thucydides is usually accounted the first &quot;real&quot; historian; because of his use of written material, interviews with participants, and scientific objectivity, he set a precedent that would be held as the ideal for all who followed.  Thucydides remarks at the beginning of his book that:&quot;...if these words of mine are judged useful by those who want to understand clearly the events which happened in the past and which (human nature being what it is) will, at some time or other in much the same ways, be repeated in the future.&quot;  No historian today would claim that the past repeats its self, but, sadly, human nature does.  Like some of my fellow reviewers you can see the correlation of the Peloponnesian and Delian leagues with the United Nations and NATO of today.  The numerous peace treaties and ambassadorial delegations seem so closely to mirror our present time.  This book is at the bedrock of Western Civilization, and must be read to understand the great European conflicts which followed.	2001-05-23

Francois duc do La Rouchefoucauld was cursed with a double nature which led him in his career as a courtier to, as Leonard Tanner puts it in his introduction \\"romantic self-dedication followed by bitter disillusion.\\"  After the fighting in Paris of 1652 he retired to a quiet life of contemplation and the society of such friends as Mme de Sevigne, who's letters give us such a vibrant window upon that age.  It was during the many meetings he had with these friends that the first maxims evolved, and which he would continue to compose and perfect until his death in 1680.  Nothing quite like them had ever existed before in European literature, and their precision and bleak though biting wit would shape the style of French letters for centuries to come.

As well as being a great historian Plutarch was a philosopher who used the examples of good and infamous men alike to reinforce his conception of morality and what the best in a man can truly be.  Unlike other classical  historians, he doesn't just accept stories about individuals at face value  but always mentions conflicting facts in the historical record.  He often  digresses in mid narrative, but never to the reader's frustration, as it is  always with an eye to the social practice's and political environment of the  people of whom he writes, analyzing deeply with an anecdote here or an  quotation there the merits and demerits of that society, and leaving us  with a clearer picture of the classical mind-set as well as we might know  it.  As for the translation of Dryden which my fellow reviewer below much  bemoans, I can only say that as a classic of English prose style it ranks  only second to Gibbon and reminds us that Plutarch means not just to  educate, but to delight and entertain as well; such an achievement is not  easily matched without the advantage of genius.	2000-06-25

On a review of his life one is taken aback that one man could have  had such drive and energy to divide between civic reforms, military  campaigns, and a host of other activities which brought him fame and renown  through out the entire Roman world; when at the same time he could with  ease write masterworks of classical literature the vividness and potency of  which still stun us.

Although you can't rank him with Tacitus (and Suetonius certainly doesn't bother to give much background information) he did write an entertaining introduction to the lives of those first rulers of imperial Rome we have  only known by rumors but find the truth was even more bizarre.  This fine  translation by the poet Robert Graves was the inspiration for his classic  novels 'I, Claudius' and 'Claudius the God'.	2000-05-27
US	49747564	R2RCH81DXFFT7W	0140441506	141219283	The Histories (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Considerations	I will agree with some that this work can often be confusing in Tacitus failure to fully explain new characters as they suddenly appear as if from no where, but the narrative is smooth, never tiresome, and it must be  considered that it was written more than a thousand years ago and has been  left to us in a mutilated form.  Despite these small drawbacks Tacitus is  still Rome's greatest ancient historian and the greatest stylist in the  Latin language.	2000-05-27

An engaging account of the reign of Justinian I and his queen Theodora, but if your looking for down to earth scholarship and historical objectivity, then you won't find it here.  Though the story is wonderfully,  even at times humorously told, Procopius seems to have written the work  merely to blow off steam at his employer's expense.  He describes Justinian  as a money grubbing &quot;demon in human shape&quot;, and Theodora as not  much better.  By the end of the book you are left with the impression that  despite such accomplishments as his successful expansion of the empire, the  Justinian Code, and the church of Hagia Sofia, still one of the wonders of  the ancient world which Procopius would consider a worthless building  project, no greater pair of sinners ever walked the earth.  I will admit,  Justinian was far from sainthood, (it's been estimated a hundred million  people perished under his reign) but he certainly deserves a better hearing  than Procopius has given him.  I give the book four stars for its interest  and readability, but withold the fifth in Procopian spite.	2000-05-07

Though he constantly praises his every virtue he never forgets to detail his faults.  Slow going and a bit bewildering at first but moves to a fast paced and  exciting end.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-24
