It's not easy being in your 20s.  When you leave school, especially college, you have this ideal that your life is going to just work itself out.  You'll land a great job, meet the person of your dreams, and buy the home you've always wanted.  Needless to say, it gets you down when you're still single, can't afford living on your own, and your job isn't what you thought it would be. <br /> <br />Many of the chapter titles had the same questions and statements that I've pondered.  These are the chapters that meant the most to me: <br />- What if I don't know what I want? <br />- When do I let go of my dream? <br />- Why am I having trouble meeting people? <br />- How important are sparks? <br />- How do I weight doing something I love versus making money? <br />- What if I feel like I'm \\"stuck\\"? <br />- How do I stop comparing myself to other people? <br />- How do I stop feeling so overwhelmed? <br /> <br />However, I didn't find this book very helpful beyond the \\"I'm not alone\\" factor.  Sure these are questions I've asked and it's nice to read that other people are going through the same thing.  But there's very little in the way of advice for dealing with these concerns.  The best advice came from the contributors (make lists, imagine this scenario, ask yourself these questions, etc.).  Robbins seemed to summarize the contributors' advice in the chapter conclusions in a hopes to claim credit for the idea.	2005-08-08
US	50716846	RP1JK1SJ4I2XR	0756400023	882477161	Assassin Fantastic	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Good but could have been stronger	I finished the \\"Assassin Fantastic\\" anthology, edited by Marc Greenberg and Alexander Potter.  It was a better anthology than most that I've read, but I still found the assassins very similar from story to story.  Most could be summed up as \\"dark and mysterious,\\" not too far removed from a romance novel hero in its \\"cardboard-ness\\".  And the plots were predictable. <br /> <br />The stories that I became most engaged in were Tanya Huff's \\"Death Rites\\" where if anyone has read here two novels about the brother/sister assassin duo Bannon and Vree (respectively), then you'd enjoy this little tale.  It's just a one-shot story that doesn't try to develop much of who they are.  It's better if you've read the stories and know the characters, because you can certainly catch several instances of continuity with the novels.  The story doesn't try to do too much and that makes the plot so much better. <br /> <br />Teresa Edgerton's \\"Dying By Inches\\" also jumped off the beaten path about a woman seeking revenge on the man who wrought so much trouble for her and her family.  This story focuses more on a moral dilemma than an assassination. <br /> <br />Kristin Rusch's \\"Coin of the Realm\\" was also an enveloping story about a princess on her way to her wedding.  You see the end coming a mile away, but the writing and characterization made it worth reading.  It's smart but easy and that worked very well. <br /> <br />Lynn Flewelling is an author who I enjoy, but she failed to capture me with her story-within-a-story, \\"Raven's Cut.\\"  It was just icky and dumb. <br /> <br />Anna Oster's \\"History and Economics\\" was a great premise but ended up vague, confusing, and one step away from snuff porn.  Very unlikely that the guy going after the assassin who killed his sister would end up so familiar with the killer. <br /> <br />I was very disappointed in P. N. Elrod's yakkity story, \\"Myhr's Adventure in Hell.\\"  Yep...that about sums it up.  I was in hell. <br /> <br />The rest other handfulof stories were bland, poorly written, and/or submitted solely for getting a known author.  In the case of the latter, the work produced by the author felt more like a writing excersize than an actual attempt at a story.	2005-07-11

It's about the world's only female werewolf, Elena, who has returned to the Pack, because some enemy is picking off members of the Pack one by one. Not only must Elena deal with the baggage of leaving her \\"normal\\" life in Toronto, but she must also deal with the emotional baggage of the Pack members whom she left, especially the one werewolf she most wants to avoid - Clay. It turns out there's a lot of resentment between these exes, and when you learn what it is, it's a twist I didn't see coming. <br /> <br />The novel is sexy, adventurous, and Armstrong does amazingly well developing characteristics that I can best describe as \\"wolf in human's clothing.\\" As human or wolf, each version of Elena has essence of the other. <br /> <br />I found this book entertaining. I also appreciated that the writer focused only on the werewolf as the world's supernatural beings, with a clan-like culture and wolfish mentality. No vampires, witches, elves or goblins. I liked that because I had a better sense of the characters and it made the supernatural more natural. <br /> <br />However, I hear her subsequent novels in this series aren't as werewolf centric. I may pick the sequel up at the library; more because Armstrong's writing is intelligent than to find out that there are supernatural beings other than werewolves. <br /> <br />Good novel. Worth reading.	2005-05-13

I can see where and why the movie deviated from the book, but that made reading the book more interesting, because it was a familiar story, but not the exact same thing as what I'd seen. <br /> <br />I feel like the movie stayed true to the book, which is about a young, single woman who gets pregnant during the latter years of WWII. Her strict preacher of a father sends her from their home in the heart of Denver, CO and arranges for her to marry a farmer. For Livvy, this is torture. Before getting knocked up, she'd almost completed her Master's degree in history/archeology, so to be in the middle of nowhere with no one she knows, bored and pregnant, is devastating. <br /> <br />Her relationship with her \\"husband,\\" Ray, is a distant one. He's a sweet and humble man who does what he can to make her comfortable and he eventually falls in love with her. <br /> <br />But Livvy can't understand why a farmer like him would be willing to accept a woman like her, who knows nothing of farming and doesn't understand rural life, and who's willing to accept a baby that is not his own. <br /> <br />A second plot comes into play, when Livvy meets the Uhmara sisters (Rose and Lorelei) who are living in the local Japanese internment camp and volunteer their time to work on local farms, teach English to the young, and keep their family trade of tailoring alive. <br /> <br />Intrigue, love, secrets, and family are all central themes to this novel. <br /> <br />It's decently written, but often slow paced, and the secondary plot doesn't seem necessary, but it's still a captivating and heart-warming story.	2005-05-13

Ever. <br /> <br />In David Sosnowski's sophmore novel and first stab at the vampiric mythos, Vamped, is a riot! <br /> <br />Marty the Vampire may have the body of a 20 year old, but he's lived for 100 years. He was vamped when he was a dying soldier in WWII and has since spent his unlife doing what he can to keep himself amused, including joining a plot to \\"flip\\" the world population in favor of the vampires. Unfortunately, what this leads to is a quasi-depressing world where humans are rare, farm-raised, and only available via the Internet to the highest bidders. This leads a world full of vampires drinking stem cell derived, manufactured blood. Needless to say, the idea of forever gets old to vampires now and then. <br /> <br />To spice things up Marty decides to make things more interesting by killing himself, he ends up coming across a human in the form of a bossy six-year-old cutey named Isuzu Trooper Cassidy, who along with her now-murdered mother escaped from a local human-farm. <br /> <br />Intending Izzy as a snack, Marty smuggles her back to his apartment. After a few attempts to convince himself that Isuzu is on the menu, he gives up because he's fallen in love with her and instead decides to raise her as his daughter. <br /> <br />Let the laughter ensue! With incidents ranging from superglue to going to the toilet to the wicked hell that are the teenage years, we follow the hilarious adventures of Marty's impromtu parenting. Along the way, we learn about the loving family that Marty grew up in, losing his dear father at a too young age, Marty wants to be the father he never had. The comedy of this book is often turned on its head with unexpected heartwarming and heartbreaking scenes of devotion, love, and letting go. <br /> <br />Even the stuff that I didn't like somehow felt right. I wanted to hate particular scenes or actions, but they just made too much sense to the story being told. <br /> <br />This book managed to give me warm fuzzies as it tickled my funny bone. <br /> <br />Read it and enjoy!	2005-05-13

After her plan to marry money falls through, she decides to shear her hair and join the military as a man.  All the while she is being pursued by the rakish Captain Ulyanov. <br /> <br />Amazon.com's customers rated this book with three stars out of five, and I agree with it.  I found the narrative to be well written and intellectual - Scrupski borrows literary characters from classic Tsarist writers (Tolstoy, etc.).  The plot reads like a contemporary Jane Austen novel full of matchmaking, failed relationships, misunderstandings, and a pretty bow-tied ending.  My issue is with the main character.  Her emotions towards other people change so often and without reason that a manic depressive would get whiplash.  Most characters are cardboard cutouts of classic Russian literature, which is both interesting (literary references)...but sadly predictable.  You know the guy who seems good isn't and the bad guy is actually good ([i]Pride and Prejudice[/i] much?). <br /> <br />It wasn't a light read either.  In the moments where characters and emotions made sense, you felt yourself thrown into the world of turn of the century Russia.  When the opposite is true, it's difficult to get to the next page.	2005-01-27

Simply a great, great epic novel. <br /> <br />The Light Bearer tells the duel story of the Germanic tribeswoman Auriane and the Roman Senator Marcus Julianus. From the reviews I've read, this is a very thoroughly research book. It takes place during the reigns of Nero, Vespatian, Titus, and Domitian. While the books caption leads one to think it's a love story, it is first and foremost a book about people trying to preserve their way of life. The Romans view the Germanic tribes as uncivilized and little more than groups of animals. The Germans view the Romans as domineering, unreligious, and misogynistic. <br /> <br />Auriane is the daughter of the head of the tribe. A priestess deemed at birth that she is destined for so much and that comes to fruition as Auriane grows older. She has a Roman serf teach her how to fight because she sees that the ways her people fight are not effective against the Romans. But still, she cannot completely reconcile her feelings for the Roman ways of war with her people's way of life, creating an interesting and heartfelt internal conflict. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the governor of Germania (Marcus Arrius Julianus) finds his long lost son (Marcus Julianus...confusing, I know) in the slums of Rome and raises him to take his mantle as a strong Roman figure. What he doesn't expect is that his son's life in the slums has taught him the value of intellectual and social equality...which causes more than one Roman eyebrow to lift in suspicion. But when Nero targets the Julianus family as traitors, Marcus's father takes his own life. <br /> <br />Okay,that's enough, because if I were to summarize this novel appropriate, I wouldn't be able to stop myself from telling too much. This book is slow enough that you can absorb the cultures, lives, and emotions of the characters, but fast enough that the 1000+ pages seems no more than any other novel. <br /> <br />It's fabulous. A new favorite book of mine. <br /> <br />I highly recommend it.	2004-10-20

It was a male-centric book, except that the women of Underdark were the rulers.

It's also the first book in the trilogy. It's about a young woman, Talia, who lives in an oppressive household and runs away when she is told she has to marry. She's an imaginative and extremely shy and self-conscious young woman. She stumbles (literally) upon a Companion, a white horse of the Heralds of Valdemar who serve the monarchy. The Companion takes her to the capital where she goes into training to become a Herald and finds out that she has been chosen by a special Companion whose Herald is the Monarch's Own, sort of the one person the monarch can trust above all else. The first book is mainly about her intitial years at the capital, getting to know people, learning what Heralds are and do, and overcoming her extreme shyness. <br /> <br />I read these books when I was about Talia's age and it meant a lot more to me then than it did now. I got into reading through Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series, but after a few years, I think I outgrew them. <br /> <br />I decided to read the trilogy again, because I wanted to read a series and fantasy tends to have the most extensive series available, and because I had read them and was interested in seeing how my views of the book had changed. <br /> <br />The following book in the trilogy is \\"Arrow's Flight\\" and the third is \\"Arrow's Fall.\\"	2004-10-20

This book suffers somewhat from the \\"middle of the trilogy\\" syndrome, but it keeps the plot going. <br /> <br />One thing I've noticed about Hearn's works is that events are well-paced and the action is detailed without being overly descriptive. Even if you're a slow reader (like I can be), these books are quick reads. <br /> <br />This book begins with Lady Kaede, who is now on her own with her lady-in-waiting Shizuka, who is also part of The Tribe. Kaede must now find a way to fend for her life and help her sisters survive in this dangerous world they live in. With the help of Shizuka, she learns how to defend herself and learn the skills that traditionally belong to a man, because she knows that she can no longer trust anyone else, and she will certainly not trust a man again. Her only love Takeo has been taken away and she does not even know whether he is alive. <br /> <br />Takeo is also unaware of what has become of Kaede. He has been taken by the Tribe and will eventually become one of them as is his birthright. Takeo has no desire to be with them but is bound to them by heritage and a promise he made in the first book. <br /> <br />Takeo and Kaede live day by day, yearning for each other and never knowing whether they will see tomorrow. Their struggles and adventures are comparable to a cross between Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Lord of the Rings. The Tales of the Otori are written on an epic scale, brought to a conclusion by the third installment, Brillance of the Moon. <br /> <br />Grass for His Pillow is an adventure epic that is beautifully written and researched thoroughly by Hearn.	2004-10-20

One night his village is massacred by the chief warlord, Iida. Tomasu pulls a trick and escapes into the mountains and is saved by another warrior lord, Otori Shigeru. Otori takes Tomasu in as his adopted son, renames him Takeo (after Otori's late brother), and the young man begins to learn the way of the warrior. It soon becomes apparent that he possesses the skills of the assassin class known as the Tribe which include superior hearing, stealth, invisibility and the ability to leave a \\"second self\\" behind. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, a second plot told involves Kaede, a young woman who is the daughter of a lord but held hostage to keep her family from considering an uprising. The warlords are to use Kaede as a pawn in an arranged marriage with Otori. Things get complicated because of a certain Lady Maruyama, and then Takeo's feelings toward Kaede. A little Shakespearean tragedy within a Japanese setting makes for plenty of intrigue. <br /> <br />Takeo makes an interesting and likable protagonist, and I found myself cheering for him and all the challenges he had to face. The side characters were also colorful, with heroic Otori Shigeru, the mysterious teacher Kenji, the doomed Lady Maruyama, jinxed Kaede, and more. Some of them will play larger roles in the following two books. <br /> <br />While the language and sentence construction read fairly simple, there is graphic violence and some sex that should be for a more mature audience. The dialogue was sometimes stilted but appropriately formal to fit into the way it is in Japan. For the most part, Hearn makes this story work.	2004-10-20

It's got a bit of a British English slant, but then the author is English. The book is about the history of punctuation, how the use of punctuation has changed, and the role it plays in clarifying the content of a sentence. The author does a good job at pausing every now and then to explain the difference between American English and British English punctuation. For example, the British don't usually put a period (or \\"full stop\\") after an abbreviation. <br /> <br />English: Mister = Mr <br />American: Mister = Mr. <br /> <br />While educational, the book is also very entertaining and, as a writer, it was something that I enjoyed.

It is by far the best novel of the three, but in the wider scheme of fiction and even fantasy...it remains mediocre. Since this book was written early in Lackey's writing career, you can see how her style and plots improve from one novel to the next. That said, the villians are still cardboard; right down to the evil laugh. The main characters, such as Talia, Dirk, Kris, and Elspeth, become more fleshed-out though. They become more understandable to the reader and their personalities finally become consistent. <br /> <br />More than issue with the plot, this time, I find her writing style simplistic. The voices of the characters, their senses of humor, are very similar to each other. Everyone has an annoying cute petname like \\"catling\\" or \\"dearling\\" and too often, regular dialog is punctuated with exclamation marks. It gets annoying because it's over-used and unnecessary. <br /> <br />I also had issues with the part of the book in which Talia is captured and imprisoned by the evil Prince Ancar and raped and tortured. Her rape gets about a paragraph of attention and is written off as if it's not a big deal because she's so devastated by the death of her friend and that she might never have the chance to make things right between her and Elspeth and her and Dirk. <br /> <br />I was placated somewhat to see the after-effects of rape brought up and dealt with but it was a bit too easily resolved (oh, we've got mind-Healers for that!).	2004-10-20

It's the fourth book in her series of fictional novels centered on the life and times of Elizabeth I. In this novel, Maxwell's attention turned to the the waning years of Elizabeth's life and her ongoing struggle to colonize Ireland. Her nemesis in the novel is Grace O'Malley, the pirate queen and &quot;Mother of the Irish Rebellion.&quot; The first part of the novel is based on the historical meeting of the Queen and Grace, and then fictionalizes the retelling of Grace's own life and what brought her before the queen. That is, namely, to beg a truce of the queen to save her son from the clutches of the dastardly English governor of Ireland and to hopefully establish some peace. As the cousel between Grace and Elizabeth closes, the queen grants the Irish pirate's request. A wary trust to say the least, though both women have developed greater respect for one another as powerful women in a world of men.<br />But Elizabeth soon finds herself sending Robert, Devereaux, ear of Essex, to quash the ongoing Irish rebellion. Suffering from syphilis and outnumbered in troops, O'Malley convinces Essex that a truce can save many a life. Essex, in turn, makes peace with the Irish but when he returns to England, the queen denounces him and brands him a traitor to the crown for personal and political reasons.<br />Like her three preceeding novels, this is a mixture of fiction and history. IMO, the first part of the novel is much more interesting and you can tell the author has a profound respect for the sea-loving Irish noblewoman, Grace O'Malley. The second part of the book is more of a war story, in which Grace plays a much lesser part.<br />If you like late Renaissance history and don't want to read a book that exhalts Elizabeth as the ruler of a golden age, then give this one a try.	2004-03-18

With great imagery and poetic description, one feels drawn into the land.  Unfortunately, the character of Beatrice leaves much to be desired.  She's an anti-heroine through and through.  She knows what she wants (Wideacre) and she'll resort to any means necessary to keep it.  As a regular person, she's hard to related to and you find yourself so drawn into her lies and manipulative actions, that you become frustrated with the character and the situations.<br />Yes, there is incest in the book.  It's pretty needless and this is one of the reasons why I will not read the other novels in this trilogy.  Another reason is because of Beatrice's deeds, I lost a sense of connection with the Laceys.  The only comfort found in this novel is from the secondary characters, who also become twisted by Beatrice.  I found the conclusion of the story satisfying.	2004-02-27

The language was a bit to reminiscent of Joss Whedon's Buffy slang for my liking, and I found most characters beyond Sunshine and Constantine to be one-dimensional.  This novel felt like it was setting itself up to be yet another vampire series, a la Laurel Hamilton (of whom I'm not a big fan).  If this book remains a stand alone, I think I will respect it a bit more for it's willingness to leave a few strings untied and left up to the reader's imagination.<br />As for plot, it was a bit lacking beyond the vampire/mystical reality.  I felt that the author used the bakery as a way to pass the time instead of using it to give Sunshine some depth.  There are some very striking moments in the novel, usually centering on Sunshine's developing bond with Constantine.  The secondary characters, such as Sunshine's family and boyfriend, feel more like blips in the story or, when they actually play a small part, they are carbon copies - bland and practically useless.<br />One major problem with the writing was that I found myself skimming or practically skipping pages and being able to still know what's going on.  The narrative was too often a stream of consciousness or overly tangential with unneccessary background information that did little for the storyline.<br />If you're looking for a book that's a quick read with progressively increasing elements of mystical reality, then this book is worth it.  Otherwise, I'd keep scanning the shelves.	2004-02-24

I haven't read any other books in Daheim's B&amp;B series, but I don't think I want to.  The writing was weak, the characters have very little dimension, and there was just too much subplot (if you can call it that).<br />Joe was about the only character that appealed to me.  He actually used his brains to assist, unlike Judith who could charm anyone, no matter how unwilling they were to talk.  And Renie was just annoying.<br />Attempts at comedy usually fell flat.  Gertrude was pretty fun, though.  I think we all know someone a bit like that (for me, it's my aunt).<br />The reason I'm giving this book two stars is because it's a light-read and it's meant to be one.  But it's not the quality I was hoping for when I picked it up at the bookstore.	2003-09-23

Otherwise you'll miss out on one of the most empowering and liberating works that I've ever read.  Having Gloria Steinem add her two cents is just an added bonus.<br />The Vagina Monologues don't put on the kid gloves.  They give you an open and honest view of what women think of their vaginas.  Why are women afraid or embarassed of their vaginas?  Eve Ensler makes it a point to tell women (through the words of other people) that who they are and what they are is precious.<br />The Vagina Monologues manages to take the reader from the heights of laughter into true stories of rape, birth, and sexual abuse.  This masterpiece makes you giddy, makes you reflect, makes you sad...but what it really does is makes you think!	2003-02-19

She is an intelligent character who is believable and acutely historical.<br />I discovered Dalby while traveling in England and Scotland.  The depth and detail of this book couldn't have been written by a more apt author.  Dalby is a known athropologist who is the only Westerner became a part of the the Japanese geisha society.  Her extensive historical and cultural research in Japan lends itself to creating a fluid and comprehensive novel with realistic characters and events.<br />Her style may be occasionally technical or academic and her plot sometimes lags, but the detail, imagery, and style of the story more than compensate for these momentary lapses in her writing.<br />I highly recommend this novel.  If you are looking for a non-fiction book on Japanese culture and society, I recommend &quot;Geisha&quot; by Ms. Dalby, which I consider her best book to date.	2003-02-06
US	50716846	R1QL44BGBATT0K	0520204956	618151081	Geisha	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Absolute Beauty!	This book is Dalby's definitive work on perhaps the most secret, the most mysterious, and certain the most provocative aspect of Japanese society - the Geisha.<br />Dalby does a masterful job in showing Western culture the ins and outs of the Japanese geisha society and does an excellent job correcting many of the misconceptions about geishas.  What better person to write a social and cultural history on geishas than a person who knows the language and was accepted into that exclusive niche of that cultural.<br />I would like to give Ms. Dalby especial praise for her excellent detail and descriptions on the meaning of kimono, for which there must have been enough because she wrote an entire book dedicated to that subject matter.  I feel that the author gives a well thought out and analytical study of the history of the geisha society - what it was then and how it became what it is today.<br />This book is a great read.  Dalby's style makes this book flow.  It certainly is NOT your typically dry non-fiction historical analysis.<br />I consider this Dalby's best work to date.  It is an outstanding piece of non-fiction and a top source for information on geishas and their lives, heirarchy, history, culture, art, etc.	2003-02-06

I read them and couldn't wait to read the last.  Unfortunately, the third book lacks the beauty of the first two.  It's obvious what the difficult choice that the main character Fainne has to make of whether to be good or bad is never really doubted in anyone's mind except the character herself's own.  The love story isn't as well developed as the first two and the evil soceress is reminiscent of an wicked stepmother in a Disney cartoon.<br />I was sadly let down by this book.  \\"Daughter of the Forest\\" was enchantingly intricate as it weaved the story of an old fairy tale into an early Christian Ireland.  The second novel, \\"The Son of the Shadows,\\" lost a bit of the magical presence that was so mainlined in \\"Daughter,\\" but it made up for that with a beautiful love story.<br />\\"Child of Prophecy\\" takes a different route, and one that I admittedly had hoped for otherwise, by making the main character not a strong and sure woman or one who is determined and good, but a girl with faults and untapped power.<br />It's a good read, but not Marillier's best.  Despite my moderate disappointment with this story, I'm looking forward to her new series that will be coming out later this year.  Marillier is a good writer and I hope her successes continue.	2003-02-04

The author so masterfully wrote the interactions between these characters, where I, as a reader, felt so completely a part of it.<br />I wish the author had addressed Hyacinthe a little more, but I have a feeling that this is what the final novel in the trilogy will be concering.<br />Jacqueline Carey is an original and excellent writer.  Her stories are compelling and her characters are realistic (for a fantasy).  Carey has a great talent for portraying the world of politics, cultures, and intrigue.<br />I recommend this novel to anyone with an open mind and a love for fantasy!	2003-02-04

Well, if this is you, then your in for a treat.

This is more than Southern women's hijinx.  It strikes to the heart of what family is...what it should be.  It is the bond between mothers and their children and the imperfect lives we all lead.

Taking world history and showing reader's a different path from the point of Christ's crucifixion onward.  With that concept, she has created a world that is both familiar and new to us and a culture that is as exotic as it is erotic.<br />Carey manages to create a heroine that is intelligent and sexy.  Her characterization is well developed and her plot line is engaging and draws the reader into the political intrigues.  At times, your head swims with the politics and people of the novel, but that's not a criticism.  I took this novel to be an interpretation of the Renaissance/Elizabethan era, and the politics for the era are dead on.<br />The action in this novel, once it starts, is almost non-stop.<br />One criticism I have against the novel is if this is a society and culture that espouses the concepts of free-love (love as thou wilt), where men and women are not judged for being sexually involved with another person of the same sex, then why are there no same-sex marriages?  Why are men still viewed as the dominant sex.  Why are Cassilines only men and women are subservient, yet Namaah is held with such reverence and prostitution is seen as holy because of Elua (a child of Mother Earth, Christ and Mary Magdalene) and Namaah (Elua's provider through prostitution).  Despite its sexual liberty, this culture is very heterocentric and still focuses on the concepts primogeniture and male dominance, which don't make coincide with the establishment of the culture and history of the novel.<br />Another small issue is the repetitive voicing of the future.  Phedre often remarks about \\"not knowing then what she knows now\\" which I found distracting to the current action.  Another repetitive description the author uses is the term \\"beautiful.\\"  The characters all seemed to look the same...\\"beautiful.\\"  I wanted more than that.  I felt like Carey drew these characters from a magazine, and Carey used the term so much that it became shallow instead of rare and precious or well-founded.  What makes a person beautiful?  What makes a person ugly?  We don't really find out.<br />Nevertheless, this novel is amazing and excellent in its style.  it takes only a few pages to grasp the author's vivid use of language that captivates and entralls the reader.  I highly recommend it...it is full of depth and intrigue, and despite a highly sexual theme that is ongoing, this novel is successful in not becoming pornographic, but remains tasteful and important to the story.	2003-01-20

While I enjoy the occasional romance novel, I am wary to pick up a book by a cross-genre writer like Vella Munn.  Its the story of a young woman Twana who has a special power to be able to locate animals, and even in one case, talk telepathically to them.  Twana's mother disappeared many years ago, and both she and her mother have been surrounded by abusive, conniving men.  Until the insipidly instant love of her life kidnaps her, and together they are able to work through their past traumas and live happily ever after.<br />There!  You know the story and that's about as exciting as it gets.  It's very negative to most of the men in the novel as a way to make the main male character more attractive and lovable to the reader.<br />This book isn't worth your time or money.

Published in the 1980, this book was cutting edge with one dreamt about ideas of successful cloning.  Amazing how the power and awe of this book lasts today.<br />The story is a futurized version of Hans Christian Anderson's \\"The Snow Queen.\\"  Personally, I'm an admirer of writers who can successfully translate traditional stories into modern literary works, and Joan D. Vinge pulls it off spectacularly.<br />Her main character, Moon, is a loving young woman who loves her cousin Sparks and goes through several trials and torments to save him from her clone, the ruthless, power-hungry, and vain Snow Queen Arienrhod.  But Sparks isn't the person Moon remembers.  He gets swept up in the crazy city of Carbuncle.  Soon, Moon is also swept up in this whirlwind.<br />Love, suspence, action, and a mystery more cosmic than the people of Tiamat realize.

In another sense, it also took away from the &quot;unique interpretation&quot; value that was present in the first novel.<br />Still, I liked the strength of the characters in this novel, and the romantic development between the main characters was touching, if a touch unbelievable.<br />If you've read the first novel in this triology, I recommend continuing the saga, and while I have yet to read &quot;Child of Prophecy,&quot; I'm eagerly anticipating the chance to do so.	2002-12-03

I'm the second half of a 2-person book club, and we selected this book because we wanted to read something different.  After many \\"hits\\" in our readings, this one was a big miss.<br />This is definitely a book geared toward actors as the title says.  It's not for casual reading.  But, even as a source of audition monologues, this book comes across as repetitive, vague, and one-dimensional.<br />The selection of movies starts in the 1930 and goes through many famous and infamous movies, which is great - a wide range.  But it failed to give a diversity of characters, especially female characters, many of whom were the typical down-on-her-luck lasses.  And the problem with the male characters selected is the demographic...white WASPs.<br />The emotional range doesn't get too far beyond the depressed and the depressing, which is useless to a character who's auditioning for a comedy and wants to show the producers and director that they are made for this part.<br />Comedy was rare, the monologue selections redundant (except for the classics like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"), and the plot descriptions were vague at best.  Rarely were the authors able to give a sufficient set-up of the plot and characterization for the monologues.  It helped if the reader had seen the movie and understood the character's motivation and the plot, but the author's seem frightened to give away endings, when that isn't the point of their work.<br />Our book club gave this a rating of 3 out of 10, but here, that translates to a 1 star.<br />Don't waste your money...rent a movie instead.	2002-12-03

It turned out to be Romy Schneider and the magazine was celebrating the 100th anniversary of Sissi's death.<br />I was utterly FASCINATED, reading about her life, her beauty cult, her self-abusive trials with anorexia and bulimia, her marriage to the emperor, and so forth.<br />A few years later, I got the chance to study abroad in Austria and hat the opportunity to visit actual historical Sissi-related sites.<br />When I got back to the US for my senior semester of college, I took a women's studies course and did a paper of the Austro-Germanic Beauty Cult surrounding Empress Elisabeth of Austria.  This, along with my personal experiences in Austria and Hamann's book, provided me with a plethora of information about Elisabeth.<br />But what made me truly appreciate this book was the way that the author presented the material.  This book read like a novel.
