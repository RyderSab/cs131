When the initial PR on a book is about how much the publisher is  going to spend on marketing the book, I feel it's fair game to factor  this information into the review. Orchard Books ( a division of Scholastic)  is positioning a British import, CHILDREN OF THE  LAMP: THE AKHENATEN  ADVENTURE, as the first installment of another flagship franchise.  Two more books have been contracted and Dreamworks has purchased the  film rights. Could it be another Harry Potter? Well...no. But CHILDREN  OF THE LAMP if filled with potential.<br /><br />THE AKHENATEN ADVENTURE has the scope of an epic adventure, moving  rapidly from New York, to London, to Cairo, to Russia, and even to  the polar ice cap. It's opening earthquake sequence in the Egyptian desert with a native artifact hunter and his son is evocative of an  Indiana Jones adventure. It's London museum crime caper calls images  of Thomas Crown or maybe Artemis Fowl.<br /><br />The book is also populated by interesting characters including twins  who are unaware of their destiny, an adventurous uncle, a one armed  butler, and two dogs with a past. Like Harry, twelve-year-old John  and Philippa Gaunt discover that they are not ordinary. When both have  an early arrival of wisdom teeth, the truth of their heritage starts  to emerge - they are part of a powerful clan of Djinn. Unlike Harry,  however, the reader may find it hard to empathize with the twins who  live in Manhattan, in an extremely privileged family, and seem to be  spoiled beyond reason. Also like the boy wizard, the twins find themselves  to be central characters in a great battle of good and evil - or more  accurately, good luck and bad luck. You see, Djinn control all the  luck in the world, and a population balance between the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" Djinn  clans is essential to a smoothly functioning world.<br /><br />There is also great potential in the magical world P. B. Kerr creates.  The Djinn world is refreshingly different from the now overworked world  of wizards and witches. Interesting ideas like what is life like inside  a bottle? It is perhaps the set up of this world, however, that most  directly keeps THE AKHENATEN ADVENTURE from our RECOMMENDED list. Kerr spends so much time having Uncle Nimrod explain the rules the Djinn world, and it takes so long for the twins to be come the active agents  in the story, that the book fells like a very long prologue to a potentially excellent story.<br /><br />On a more personal note. I am not a stickler for political correctness,  but I had a problem with the part smoking plays in the story. I can understand its presence in principle, but it really is not crucial  (at least in this book), particularly to the detail of naming brands.  And this brings up another \\"what were the editors thinking\\" aspect  of this book.  It is filled with product placements. Do corporations  now pay publishers for placements like they do film producers? Or is  this a concession to the film deal already in place?<br /><br />Reservations aside, I do look forward to the next installment, and I  hope the trilogy lives up to potential.<br /><br />SPECTRUM Children's Book Club - [...]orld  of wizards and witches.

She lives in a society that neatly tests, evaluates and classifies all of its people. The Wind Singer is a solid, fast-paced adventure for young readers with interesting characters and a theme to which most students and educators can relate: standardized testing. What if your whole life was measured by a series of tests, standardized and thus seemingly fair to all who took them? What if your family's status within the community depended on the accumulated scores of parents and children? What if you just don't fit into this system?<br />At the heart of this book is an examination of social structure. Like Swift's Gulliver, Kestral and her brother, Bowman, journey beyond the confines of their society and encounter two cultures-the peaceful, agrarian Mud People and the mobile, warring cities of Ombaraka and Omchaka. These societies seem strange even though they are logically based on the philosophical and physical dispositions of their people. But Kestral is no more an alien in these societies than she is in her own.<br />That is not to say The Wind Singer is a heavy-handed lecture on the ills of society. First and foremost, this is a tale of adventure. The author, a screenwriter (Tomb Raider) and director, draws vivid action scenes and moves the plot along at a motion-picture pace.<br />There is not a lot of depth to the characters in this first volume of a trilogy because, like J. K. Rowling, the author lets us learn about the characters through their actions rather than long passages describing who they are and justifying their personalities. As the trilogy continues to grow, so will its characters. In the end, the entire cast of characters are interesting and immensely enjoyable. I am particularly fond of Hanno Hath, the patriarch of the Hath family and a most unlikely revolutionary.<br />The Wind Singer is a very good entertainment that should have a broad appeal to boys and girls alike.<br />- KB Shaw, Publisher<br />SPECTRUM Children's Book Club<br />[...]alike.<br />- KB Shaw, Publisher<BR>SPECTRUM Children's Book Club<BR>[...]	2003-12-10

With the character introductions out of the way, and the major underlying plot line established, She is free to hurtle us into the past in order to come to the present, when a relative, who could be Charlie's doppelganger, is whisked by a glowing marble from Bloor's academy to the Bloor's Charlie now attends.<br />Amidst the underlying struggle of good and evil that permeates both the academy and Charlie's Yewbeam family history, Charlie must discover the truth about the boy from the past to secure the boy's future.

He yearns for adventure. Perhaps that is why he is drawn to the likes of Dr.  Harker, a well-traveled scholar, and to Will Piggot, a young pickpocket. When Will is found murdered with a Death and the Arrow card upon his body, Tom seeks the aid of Dr. Harker in his quest to bring Will's murderer to justice.<br /><br />Chris Priestly has crafted a wonderful tale that is a rousing blend of  Robert Louis Stevenson adventure and Sherlock Holmes detective story. Priestly's bits of historical detail add texture to the tale  without losing sight of his action/adventure pacing.<br />Although the reading level  says ages 9 and up, this is a terrific book  for anyone who reads to younger children at bedtime, for it will keep them entertained  and will inspire them to revisit the book on their own when they are older.<br />- KB SHAW,  Publisher<br />Spectrum Children's Book Club - [...]<br />  Member SCBWI	2003-12-10

That genre is fantasy and the strains are influenced by that boy wizard from England and a certain Hobbit from Middle Earth.<br />Fans of what is called \\"high fantasy,\\" as epitomized by the Lord of the Rings trilogy, will form the core audience for Christopher Paolini's new \\"Inheritance\\" trilogy. While Eragon does not have the epic scale of LOTR, it compares favorably to LOTR in several ways. In writing a single-focus story with the title character Eragon in every scene, Paolini puts an equal emphasis on character and plot development, often delving into Eragon's thoughts. But like Tolkien, he takes his time to create a vividly real mythical world and a very human protagonist.<br />I recommend this book not only to fantasy fans, but also to those who might be new to the genre, or who think they don't like it. This books is less about elves and dragons and quests, than it is about character. And, if prophecies are to be believed, this may develop into one heckuva romance as well.<br />I recommend this book to any young person interested in becoming a writer, for the author began the book when he was just fifteen and was nineteen when it was published. The writing is technically much better written than many adult authors, which makes the young author's acknowledgements an important part of appreciating his effort.<br />Eragon's one negative is actually another similarity to LOTR: an unsatisfying end to book one, which may, suggest the trilogy may be like LOTR, one long, continuous story rather than three standalone books.<br />- KB Shaw, Publisher<br />SPECTRUM Children's Book Club<br />[...]	2003-12-10

Reading Level: 9-12<br />The adventure begins in an unlikely place: the laundry room of a New York apartment building where Gregor is washing the family clothes and babysitting his two-year-old sister, Boots. Gregor is doing laundry while most of the other kids in the neighborhood are at summer camp because, since his father disappeared, his mother works very hard to support the family, which includes another, younger sister and Gregor's grandmother.<br />When the curious Boots is discovered dangerously close to an open vent shaft, Gregor is horrified to see her sucked in. In his attempt to grab her, Gregor is himself propelled into the shaft and begins his long fall down to Underland. While the fall and the name of the topsy-turvy underworld are Collins' acknowledgement of the inspiration of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, that's where the similarity ends.<br />Gregor the Overlander, is a well-written, fast-paced, extremely entertaining read populated with likeable characters and fantastic creatures. Gregor and Boots are endearing protagonists and the fantasy elements are mostly exaggerations of real-life urban creatures like bats and roaches rather than dragons and such. The straight-forward, non-stop story, with its sense of family, hints of romance, and a few gross-outs, should appeal to both boys and girls. If you are looking for a good read-aloud family book, Gregor the Overlander will fit the bill superbly.<br />- KB Shaw, Publisher<br />SPECTRUM Children's Book Club<br />[...]	2003-12-10

Books	4	1	1	N	N	SPECTRUM Children's Book Club Recommendation	Reading Level: Young Adult<br />The final book of the Wind on Fire trilogy is firesong. Unlike the gap between books one and two, Firesong begins only a short time after the fateful events in the Mastery. The rich literary heritage of this story continues as the Manth people, lead by the Hath family, embark on their epic exodus from slavery as they wander the wastelands of a disintegrating world, in search of their homeland and safety. It is an odyssey that has challenges of character and trials of trust and faith worthy of biblical or classical Greek heros.<br />After reading the three books I have modified my view about the lack of depth to the main characters. I never felt the humanity of Bo or Kestral in the same way as I felt for say, Harry Potter or Lyra, the heroine of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. But then, the Hath family is cut from a different mold. They are descendents of mythic heros like Moses, Hercules, Oedipus, and Sir Gawain. In the end, The Wind on Fire is about deeds, choices, and fate.<br />If your child likes this story, I would serve well as a springboard into re-tellings of other classic epics like The Iliad, The Odyssey,or the Knights of the Round Table.<br />- KB Shaw, Publisher<br />SPECTRUM Children's Book Club<br />[...]	2003-12-10

The death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort marked the abrupt end of innocence in this epic story and sowed seeds of discord and discontent.<br />In the first four books Harry was propelled along his series of adventures by outside forces and the circumstance of his fame. He was, like typical youth, immersed in the here-and-now, focused on the problem of the moment, without much thought to the past or concern about future consequences. During the month spent secluded at the Dursleys after the tragic events of the Triwizard Tournament, Harry has time to think about what has happened to him and worry about what is to come. And he's angry, frustrated, and feeling alienated even in his true home, the wizarding world. This broadening of Harry's perception of the world around him is the foundation to the multitude of changes found in \\"Order of the Phoenix\\". All of which result in the best Harry Potter book yet.<br />This is the first volume in the series where there is no attempt to craft a standalone book. From the first page on, Rowling assumes you know the story and are immersed in the world she has created. (She has saved us yet another 30-or-so pages by cutting the usual back story references required in a standalone book.) As expected, \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" draws on a rich existing cast of characters and locales, while taking us to places we've never been and introducing memorable characters including a clumsy auror, a wizard from the wrong side of the law, and a positively dreadful new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. But this is not the most striking difference in the book.<br />What is most different about the \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" is its tone and its deviation from the comfortable style and structure of the previous installments. All of these changes have been orchestrated to instill in us the same anxious and unsettled feelings Harry is experiencing-and they are effective. From the first chapter, we are nagged by feelings that \\"this isn't right\\" or \\"that's not the way it's supposed to be.\\" Rowling has set us up and is now masterfully manipulating the rules of the game.<br />Rowling no longer focuses only on what Harry does.

In Summerland, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon uses baseball as a metaphor for existence itself and pins the fate of everything on the outcome of a single, fateful game played by the most unlikely of teams. To carry that imagery over into this review, reading Summerland was like watching the Babe come to bat. You love the Babe. You have all the expectations of seeing him one out of the park, so anything less than a home run-a single or even a double-tends to be a disappointment. I wanted-I expected-to read a great book, but instead, I discovered a good book, which would not, and should not, be a disappointment if it were not for the stature of the author.<br />Summerland is not great children's literature. It's 500 pages are filled to the brim with characters, gadgets, fantasy worlds, and situations derived from a wealth of sources from Native American and European mythology to American Tall Tales. And that may be why this book is not a home run. Like so many power hitters, Chabon is so determined to hit knock the cover off that he uses his power when maybe a finesse blooper over the shortstop's head would be best.<br />Chabon crams so much \\"stuff\\" into this book that he lacks focus-on the storyline and particularly on character development. Chabon doesn't write consistently from point of view of our baseball-hating hero, Ethan Feld. Therefore, Ethan is not the focus of our attention or our emotional attachment as this child of destiny should be. He becomes just one of many characters in an adventure story. If we become attached to Ethan, we will, by extension care for those close to him and dislike those who want to do him harm. J. K. Rowling accomplishes this with great success by staying focused on Harry Potter's point of view.<br />But other authors have successfully incorporated multiple points of view in their works. The Lord of the Rings and Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy are two fantasy masterworks. Tolkien leaves Frodo and the Ring for many, many pages at a time to tell the stories of multiple sets of characters and Pullman leaves his Lyra to follow happenings in multiple universes. So why doesn't Summerland rise to this level? Summerland's story just doesn't have the weight of \\"reality\\" great fantasy needs. We believe in Middle Earth, we believe in Hogwarts, and in Philip Pullman's multiple universes. Chabon doesn't focus on making the world of the book feel real. Rather, his narrative voice contains the wink and nod of a person telling a tall tale, bringing the book to the level of a Fairy Tale rather than a full-fledged fantasy adventure. And, to me, that is difference between a home run and a double.<br />But there is nothing wrong with a good solid double, and Summerland is an entertaining, if somewhat long, tall tale.<br />- K. B.

His only desire is to stay out of trouble. <br />In choosing the adult Samuel as her storyteller, Ms. Pearsall has created a voice that is at once educated and naive. SamuelÃ*s perception of the journey and the people he encounters is the heart of the bookï¿½most importantly, his portrayal of the crotchety, perhaps senile, old slave Harrison. The book has an almost Huckelberry Finn quality to it, mostly because of its episodic nature and the variety of \\"characters\\" the duo meet on their journey. <br />For better or worse, the author has toned down the language and dialect of the period keeping the words and dialog well within today's politically acceptable range. While this puts a softer edge on the events portrayed than should be, it does give the book a broader reach into our sometimes-restrictive educational system. In any event, it does not affect the overall value of this volume. <br />All Spectrum Home & School Magazine recommendations can be found...	2002-03-31

And like THE WIND SINGER, there is much below the surface of the action. At the heart of the tale is the duality of life. Nicholson explores the similarity and differences between good and evil, freedom and slavery (even self slavery), beauty and violence, love and hatred, and life and death.<br />The author has drawn on many sources to create this story, the most obvious of which is the Moses story and the &quot;Book of Exodus.&quot; He has utilized his research for &quot;Gladiator&quot; in creating an artistic death sport called the Manaxa. But most intriguing is his exploration of slavery. On this point long hours of discussion can ensue, because Nicholson's implications are vast. We may even pause to ask are we slaves ourselves -- slaves of culture, religion, and even work? Just who does the Master represent in Nicholson's grand design. I have a definite opinion, and I'm sure you will too.<br />The themes and juxtaposed scenes of beauty and violence make this a more mature book for older readers and adults. For these same reasons, SLAVES OF THE MASTERY rises above the level of the first book as Nicholson immerses us in two new cultures populated with characters, customs, and cultures that range from awe inspiring to absurd.<br />The only negative may be that this book may not stand on it's own, particularly in the area of character development. If you haven't read the first book, the characters seem rather sketchy and thin, particularly the Hath family around whom the story revolves. Solution?  Read THE WIND SINGER first.d THE WIND SINGER first.	2001-10-22

Who doesn't like a scary story once in awhile? Set in 1950's Michigan, &quot;The Tower at the End of the World&quot; is the sequel to Bellairs' &quot;The House with a Clock in Its Walls.&quot;  However, no prior knowledge of the first book is necessary to enjoy this tome. There are sorcerers and witches-both good and bad, as well as isolated islands-real and magical, not to mentions banshees, creeping shadows, runic threats, and a doomsday clock!

By no means do I want to suggest that this is solely a female's book. It's a terrific story to read aloud with the whole family.<br />It is 1893. Thirteen-year-old Rosie Beckett lives on a small farm in southern Illinois with her parents, grandpa, older sister, and younger brother.  It's a rugged life of early morning chores and long days of work. It's a life without electricity or anything frivolous or luxurious. The children only wear shoes for special occasions. The Becketts have no complaints-it is the life they know.  But everything changes when their aunt sends them train tickets and invites them to Chicago for a week to visit the World's Columbian Exposition. The trip is a whirlwind adventure of fact and fiction you won't want to miss.	2001-10-01

There is great excitement in the community because on this special night they will feast and be entertained by the famous &quot;Traveling Thistledown Troup.&quot; This is a tale of community, friendship, and belief that will no doubt become a family holiday tradition.	2001-10-01

I suspect that this book with the un-cool title and pulp-western cover will get overlooked by the publisher, press, and the public.  It is a gem of a story to share with your kids or to read for your own enjoyment.<br />Reading it reminded me of the hours I spent with the Hardy Boys as a kid and as a father reading them again to my children. There is only one difference: &quot;Moonshiner's Gold&quot; is really well written.  Built on a tried-and-true western plot of &quot;save the family ranch,&quot; the author has populated the tale with interesting characters and set it in a time and place balanced on the edge of on the old west and the modern world.<br />The story unfolds in the Texas Panhandle of 1927. The mixture of horses and cars, traditional ranch life and oil boom town society is fascinating. Mr. Erickson combines a ne'er-do-well Grandpa, a widowed mom, an adventurous teen, skulking moonshiners, hidden gold, the Texas Rangers, and skunk-nabbing to weave this entertaining yarn.	2001-10-01

Brian Jacques, best known for his popular Redwall fantasy-adventure series, launches a new series in his new novel, &quot;Castaways of the Flying Dutchman.&quot; With Castaways, Jacques leaves his world of Medieval mice and roguish rats, for a story of a forever-young boy &quot;condemned&quot; to roam the world for eternity, doing good deeds and helping people in need help themselves.<br />Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this book and strongly recommend it to readers 9 and up. However, chances are Redwall fans will be initially disappointed in this tale. The first fifty pages - the story of how this boy and his dog came to wander the Earth - is a ripping sea yarn worthy of Robert Louis Stevenson. Set in 1620, it has a tyrannical sea captain and a mutinous crew. After the murderous captain curses God in the midst of an epic battle against nature, an avenging angel descends to condemn The Flying Dutchman and its crew to an eternity upon the seas. When the boy, Ben, and his dog are washed overboard, the angel grants the innocent lad a reprieve of sorts: an eternal quest to do good.<br />Here again, the author must battle the expectations of even first time readers. I was looking forward to an epic tale of Ben's journey through the ages. Instead, Jacques takes us to the small English village of Chapelvale in 1896. The bulk of the book essays a single task given to the boy. In this thin plot, Ben must help a widow find the deed to her lands and save the village from developers.<br />But, like Lois Lowry's &quot;Gathering Blue,&quot; Castaways is made a very enjoyable read by the sheer quality of the writing. Jacques gives us nice, comfortable characters we can instantly like or despise and his easy, good-natured style carries us through a treasure hunt filled with riddles and non-violent confrontations with a local gang, to a predictable, yet satisfying ending.<br />I do hope, however, that in future volumes the author will fulfill the promise of adventure he displayed in the opening sequence of this novel.splayed in the opening sequence of this novel.	2001-06-11

This is a must read series for anyone who likes odd characters, peculiar happenings and a quirky sense of humor.<br />In this volume the trio are taken in by the trendy Squalors, Jerome and Esme, who live in the penthouse apartment at 667 Dark Avenue. The Squalors have welcomed the children because current fashion says orphans are &quot;in.&quot; Unfortunately for the Baudelaire's, elevators are &quot;out&quot; and their new foster family lives either forty-eight or eighty-four flights up.<br />The author's dark,delightfully witty narrative style can best be described as Alfred Hitchcock meets Monty Python. This book, we are told, &quot;is one of two books in the world that will show you the difference between the word 'nervous' and the word 'anxious.' The other book, of course, is the dictionary, and if I were you I would read that book instead.&quot; Good reading and a great value!	2001-04-09

More often than not, we are told that something like a horrid journey to a far away place or an encounter with a stalking beast along a forest path has happened, rather than experiencing the journey or having the encounter ourselves.  In many ways, this seems like the exposition half of a longer work. (And perhaps it is.)<br />But all these flaws mean nothing because the author paints a compelling picture of a society where flawed people are summarily discarded and left to die in &quot;the fields.&quot; We are sympathetic to the two-syllable orphan, Kira, with her lame leg and precarious position in the village.  We are moved by here plight and are drawn into a world we experience with wonder through her eyes.  GATHERING BLUE is more a tale of personal discovery than of physical action.<br />Like the physically flawed Kira, who is saved  from death by her artistic talents, Lois Lowry's masterly writing turns an apparently flawed story in to a small gem of a read.	2001-04-02

What's it doing in the Children's Section?  Is it simply that children are at the heart of this fable? Be forewarned, this is a rich and complex tale with themes that examine the creation and structure of the universe, good and evil, and the very meaning of life and death. While cloaked in the trappings of an epic odyssey, the language, violence, and themes make this a book most suitable for mature young readers and adults.<br />&quot;His Dark Materials&quot; is not only &quot;Dust&quot; --the fear of which propels this story -- but it is the dark recesses of human nature. Pullman questions our views of the world, science, religion and ourselves.  It is bold enough to make a clear philosophical stand, which the reader, like Lyra, comes to understand over the course of this journey through multiple universes and the inner depths of human spirit.<br />So why is this book in the Children's Section? Perhaps it's because it requires a mind not set firmly in its ways -- a mind that can jump from idea to idea as quickly as Lyra's daemon can change shapes.	2001-01-22

What if your whole life was measured by a series of tests, seemingly standardized and thus fair to all who took them?  What if your family's status within the community depended on the accumulated scores of parents and children? What if you just don't fit into this system?<br /><br /> While 'The Wind Singer' is not as rich and complex as 'The Golden Compass' and not as strongly plotted as \\"Harry Potter,\\" it is a very good entertainment, which happens to make an interesting point about education.<br /><br /> The author, a screenwriter and director, draws vivid action scenes and moves the plot along at a motion-picture pace.  There is not much depth to the characters, but this is the first book of a series, so their growth may be the focus of the books as the series progresses.	2001-01-22

It is a fairly  standard adventure tale wrapped in a small amount of science.  THE ICE  LIMIT follows an expedition to the hostile environment of the Horn Islands  at the Southern tip of South America as they try to retrieve a very  mysterious meteorite.  Neither the characters nor the story live up to the  potential of the premiss.<br />I never became emotionally involved with any of  central characters.  Indeed, some characters seem to MIA at various points  in the book.  The apparent central character, Dr. Sam Mc Farland, never  materializes as a moving force within the story.  The dynamics between Mc  Farland, a professional outcast and loose cannon,  and Eli Glinn, the  precise leader of the expedition, fizzle.  It is a central character arc  which goes unrealized.<br />The adventure plot is mechanical and telegraphed.  Like CONGO and TIMELINE, it culminates in an ultimately unsatisfying  ending, with only the last line of the book of interest.	2000-09-17
