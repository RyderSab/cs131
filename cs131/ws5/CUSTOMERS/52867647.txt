Although it does have a fair bit of technical detail that anyone can understand if they have the patience, the real charm of the book is Sara's enthusiasm, her descriptions of epiphanies, her reaction to contest stresses and contest judges, her bouts with keeping herself human.

Part Two, Ch 5, Custom Interface Design, describes a &quot;Wellington Cycle Works&quot; application that hides the natural EXCEL interface. User Forms are applied. Part Three, Database Access, I haven't explored. It also contains an example application, the &quot;Setagaya Cycle&quot; (a competitor of Wellington Cycle), which uses a database to generate a sales forecast with pivot tables, goal seek and some other functionality of EXCEL. Part Four discusses integration with Access,  Word and PowerPoint. It also discusses web application. I haven't looked at this part of the book, which also contains the &quot;Pacific Industries&quot; application that uses Access and Word to generate reports, queries external databases, uses the office assistant to guide the user, and so forth.<br />I am impressed with the authors' clarity of explanation and the examples that show how to use the various tools available. <br />The book is very approachable. Unlike books like Kofler's &quot;Definitive Guide&quot; and Walkenbach's &quot;Power Programming&quot;, the complete working examples allow the reader to see how different facets of the program can be combined. You can see how features work together. The way is clear to adapt to your own requirements.	2001-07-31

It starts from scratch (no statistical background) introduces the relative frequency and Bayesian (subjective) interpretations of probability. Both viewpoints are given throughout the book, where appropriate.  The last chapter is a very useful treatment of deconvolution in the presence of limited resolution of a measuring device, and it makes the connection to image restoration.<br />Time series analysis is not included.<br />The author's background is particle physics, and he works at CERN. Many examples come from that arena, but the presentation is definitely more accessible to an engineer, physicist or chemist than the numerous treatments by financial analysts and social scientists.	2001-07-14

Like beads on a necklace, no interconnections. <br />Even worse, circuits are presented with no practical insight or motivation. Seldom are answers given to questions like: What is the reason for using a particular circuit? What are its shortcomings and advantages? The authors take standard practice for granted, and take their job as description of standard technique. So too often you have no idea why things are done, what are the compromises, or what to explore to improve matters.<br />These days circuits are simulated easily using the free PSpice software. This book makes only a token attempt to use this software. Virtually all the examples of its use are straightforward verifications of hand design. Nowhere are we treated to PSpice as a design aid, an integral part of the design process. We are led to believe that every design is carried to near completion by hand, and then PSpice is used to check our algebra, or maybe to include second order effects that we dropped in the hand analysis. However, reality is a balance of thought and simulation, not explored in this book. A design carried out entirely by hand compared to one done jointly with simulation will be less original, slower to design, and poorer in performance.<br />My last gripe is with MOSFET's. It is clear that the authors have a bipolar bias, despite the huge importance of MOSFETs in modern IC's. The MOSFET analysis is very limited. The PSpice models for MOSFETs are hopelessly oversimple. <br />Bottom line: Look elsewhere. I'd start with &quot;Analog Integrated Circuit Design&quot; by David Johns, Ken Martin, Kenneth W.

He points out that only the last item added to the clipboard is accessible, and how to do it.   Later, pp. 762-765, Kofler introduces the programming of a new ActiveX server with VB that is used from within Excel. This approach extends clipboard access for large data sets, and requires setup using some executable VB subroutines on the supplied disk. <br />It's surprising that other books don't discuss such an important topic, even though Microsoft has made more than limited access to this feature unbearable.<br />I stick with my four-star rating.	2001-06-11

These remarks give an incorrect flavor for the book. Of approximately 350 references, less than a dozen are post 1990. The vast majority are from 1950 to 1965. The author repeatedly refers to &quot;more recent&quot; results with references to the early 1960's. So much for &quot;newer results&quot;. The author's remarks in the preface to the new edition are much more informative:  &quot;...just what could easily be added [to the new edition]. For example, even a modest treatment of finite elements...was questionable. This was also the case for multigrid methods, Krylov subspace methods, preconditioning methods, and incomplete factorization methods. In the end, only a few items were added...

Terry's book focuses on the mechanics of using various UML diagrams. The examples are based on a simple Course Enrollment system that serves to provide an example of the diagrams, but not much more insight than a a bus tour. Murray's book hits the management issues and provides a more realistic example of an aircraft cockpit simulator. He focuses on the management issues and ably describes how UML can help with the customer relations,team communication, and keeping the project on track and on budget. Paul Reed tries to do all these things and includes a lot of code to boot.<br />There is a problem with Paul's approach. Because of the amount of detail, I found it easy to get lost. What issues are balanced in  ending up with Paul's choices? Paul tries to tell me, but the issues are so closely tied to the Remulak Productions example of a musical instrument company that extraction of the idea from this particular example can be a headache that takes you back and forth through a lot of code and a lot of chapters. In the end, you will know far more than you ever wanted about Remulak Productions.<br />I find the issues and the art much more lucidly presented in Ivar  Jacobson's &quot;Object-oriented Software Engineering&quot;. <br />Bottom Line: If you want to know semantics: Quatrani, if you want to know management: Cantor, if you want a lot of detail, particularly how code is generated: Reed, if you want perspective: Jacobson.	2001-01-27

The PSpice software also allows the student to vary the problems in an almost infinite variety of ways to try out ideas about what is going on in the circuit.<br />My own gripe about this book is its (almost) complete neglect of algebraic solutions. For example, reactances in most problems are given in Ohms (just numbers), and frequency doesn't even show up. This avoidance of frequency and of symbolic values for R,L,C makes the frequency and component dependencies of the circuit obscure, and doesn't prepare the student to use algebraic expressions to understand the qualitative behavior of the circuit.<br />Sinusoidal steady-state analysis (which largely suffers from the above complaint) doesn't show up until p. 441!! Real frequency dependence doesn't show up until Bode Diagrams on p. 736!!<br />The combination of real thought using algebraic analysis with numerical simulation using PSpice is hardly even a concept in this book.<br />Bottom line:  Go elsewhere	2001-01-06

A related book that is a description of the language with nothing about the EXCEL object model is Lomax &quot;VB &amp; VBA in a Nutshell&quot;.<br />Kofler can be cryptic at times. As explanation, he says (p. 336) &quot;The long and the short of it is that you [dear reader] will not be spared the opportunity to do a bit of experimenting yourself&quot;. An example of this brevity is the treatment of the MsgBox, which is used to interrogate the user of the spreadsheet and offer a variety of choices. Kofler provides an example on p. 220, and refers the reader to the online help for amplification. In contrast, Julitta Korol offers over 7 pages of examples and tables using this function. The pro of brevity is many features can be outlined, and the reader can find the additional info for free. The con is that the reader won't appreciate the full utility of the feature without perusing the online help in some detail. <br />Compared to Walkenbach, Kofler has more about features new to EXCEL 2000. For instance, Kofler has subroutines illustrating the use of the Implements statement in VBA, while Walkenbach lists it as a statement with no comment, Green doesn't even mention it. Lomax has a complete discussion pp. 373 - 375. Kofler also describes the manipulation of files using the FSO (File System Objects) Library (pp. 245ff.), a new feature. <br />Compared to Green, Kofler is almost entirely exposition, while pp. 343-695 of Green is a listing of the EXCEL 2000 and VBE object models, which I personally find not too useful. However, because the first 245 pages of Green is compact, I find it easier to find information there. <br />Kofler definitely is a notch more advanced than Walkenbach, at least as knowledgeable, and much better organized. In fact, although there is a lot of overlap, it is handy to have both books because it is usually possible to find what you want in Kofler, and then (sometimes) use Walkenbach for a more detailed hand-holding example. However, finding something in Walkenbach by itself requires luck because of his poor organization and index.<br />None of the three EXCEL books describes the special status of sub main().<br />Bottom line: Buy Green first (cheapest), Kofler second and Walkenbach last.	2001-01-04

How  much VB do we need?<br />An example I ran into might help you decide. On p.  178 the author describes an example of an &quot;array of arrays&quot;  creating an appointment calendar with descriptions of appointments stored  in the array of arrays named &quot;apps(day)&quot;. As part of the code,  the satement appears<br />If IsEmpty(apps(day)) Then<br />I was surprised to find  that IsEmpty ALWAYS evaluated FALSE, making this If statement useless. Once  this problem was discovered, I found from the online help that IsEmpty  always evaluates false unless apps(day) is a simple variant. (Do you know  this? I had to find out.)<br />Can apps(day) be a simple empty variant? It's  supposed to be an array of arrays. Well, if you initiate apps(day)  with<br />apps(day)  = Empty<br />then the If statement works. But if you  initiate apps(day) with <br />apps(day) = Array(Empty)<br />which is how it's  done when apps(day) is NOT empty, for example,<br />apps(day) =  Array(&quot;First meeting of day&quot;, &quot;Second meeting of  day&quot;)<br />then the If statement won't work unless it is changed to <br />If  IsEmpty(apps(day)(0)) Then<br />(What do you know about arrays, array  notation, how empty array notation changes when it fills? I had to find  out.)<br />What does this have to do with evaluating the book? The above  example is not unusual. If you are happy to read at an abstract level, the  gist of the examples is clear, and the examples are interesting. In the  above example, it's clear what the IsEmpty is about, and the &quot;array of  arrays&quot; idea is great. However, if you want to implement the author's  ideas using his code, his elliptical approach leaves gaps and ambiguities.  Depending on your VB background, the needed fill-in and clarification can  require much head-scratching.<br />Bottom line: As a stimulus to the  imagination, definitely go ahead.

Comparison with exact solutions for special cases of Poisson's equation showed it to be accurate to micro percents in less time  than it takes to write the spreadsheet (a second or so). The explanation of  the program in the text is clearer than specialist discussions like  Wessling (An Introduction to Multigrid Methods), but doesn't contain  theoretical analysis of convergence rates. Personally, I find it more  persuasive to plot the errors vs number of cycles, number of smoothings  etc. than to read theoretical analysis.<br />The authors also compare various  methods and give practical advice about which methods to use. Specialist  texts on numerical methods aren't much good in this regard, being hung up  on methods where it is easy to prove convergence rates.<br />Bottom line: Good  code, good qualitative discussion, good comparisons of methods.	2000-05-29

Maybe my first review was too technical, so I'm trying again.   <br />It is clear from the positive reviews that this book is a success for an  audience of fairly advanced VB programmers. Those of us that are less  advanced (I'm a beginner) might question whether the book will suit our  needs, or if we are going to have the &quot; two-star review&quot;  experience. <br />An example might help you decide. On p. 178 the author  describes an example of an &quot;array of arrays&quot; using an appointment  calendar with appointments stored in the array of arrays named  &quot;apps(day)&quot;.

(Do you know this? If not, you won't understand how the  If-statement works. The author doesn't explain, so you'll have to figure it  out.) But apps(day) is an array of arrays; can it be an empty variant? The  above If-statement works if:<br />     apps(day) = Empty<br />which you might  deduce as what the author is thinking, but if instead the reader imagines  that <br />apps(day) = Array(Empty)<br />then the &quot;IsEmpty&quot; line must  be changed to<br />If IsEmpty(apps(day)(0)) Then<br />(What do you know about  array notation? The author mentions it, but not in the context of this  code.) The author never spells out the constituent elements of apps(day),  so the specifics are the reader's guess.<br />What does all this have to do  with evaluating the book? The above example is not unusual. If you are  happy to read at an abstract level, the gist of the examples is interesting  and clear. However, if you want to implement the author's ideas using his  code, his elliptical approach has gaps and ambiguities. He doesn't dwell on  VB details.

The few that are not  are complaints from &quot;moderately experienced&quot; VB programmers. I am  probably a novice myself, so I'll give you an example of what is expected  of you. On page 178 is an example using arrays to make an appointment  calendar. This example is fairly typical of what you might run up against  in the author's examples. The appointments in the example are stored in an  array called apps(day). Early in the code one finds the line <br />If  IsEmpty(apps(day)) Then<br />It took me a while to find out how to make this  line work. From the online help you will find that IsEmpty is meaningful  only for variants, and even then returns false if there is more than one  component in the array apps(day), whether it is empty or not. So by  watching the locals window while doing a lot of experimentation, I found  that I could arrange that when apps(day) happens to be empty, it is not  treated as an array at all, but just an empty variant variable. However, if  instead (as is quite natural) you define the empty apps(day) as an empty  array, the code won't work.<br />Personally, I think that a few words of  warning to the reader and a short Sub Main() to exercise the code would  have been in order. Certainly there are much more obvious matters that are  discussed in more detail.<br />So, bottom line? There is a lot to think about  here, and many imaginative implementations of the language. But be prepared  to mull things over and invest a bit of time.	2000-05-23

Information is scattered throughout the book, and its utility is not apparent. The reader  must invent just what might work, and guess just where in the book the  igredients of solution are stashed. If you can't visualize an approach (and  guess when Walkenbach thought about it while writing the book) you will not  find what you need.<br />An example is the Input Box. First, it is placed in  the chapter &quot;Introducing UserForms&quot;, but it is not a UserForm,  and we're never told. In time one comes to see that a VBA subroutine has to  be used to get an Input Box. By using the online help, one can find a code  example to produce an Input Box. Then Walkenbach distinguishes between  Excel's and VBA's Input Box method. But the code example on p. 357 is a  snipit:  you have to figure out how to incorporate it into a functioning  subroutine.<br />Unfortunately this pattern is repeated: debugging is  scattered about, error handling is an afterthought, exchanging data between  VBA and the spreadsheet is buried under &quot;The Range Property&quot; on  p. 155 (for writing), buried (without discussion) as a line in a code  example on p. 166 (for reading), and used (without comment) in an array  example much later on p. 287.<br />This book is a series of examples and many  useful informational items, but it's just not tutorial for most subjects.  Wells and Harshbarger, &quot;Microsoft Excel 97 Developer's Handbook&quot;  does much more for imagining how the various elements can be combined in  useful applications.	2000-05-02

For example, she has Chapter 12 &quot;How do you get  all that stuff from Excel into VBA and back?&quot; You'll be able to figure  this out from Walkenbach, but you will have to develop your own  &quot;search and find&quot; method to locate what you need: it's not  organized that way.<br />Likewise, Walkenbach talks about debugging in snipits  scattered throughout the book, while Boonin collects this topic in one  chapter: &quot;Fixing your code&quot;, where you can find a clear  discussion of the whole subject. Getz and Gilbert &quot;VBA Developer's  Handbook&quot; also have a more coherent discussion of debugging.<br />Another  gripe: combining different morsels to actually do something requires trial  and error splicing.<br />Bottom line: I recommend this book, but wish it were  less a scattergun approach.	2000-04-20
US	52867647	RACWBXZY7TSN	0201543931	652185519	Semiconductor Device Fundamentals	Books	4	0	4	N	N	boring but clear	This book is unique in its pedagogical details:tables of formulas, tables describing what idea a problem tests for,tables of technical terms, three review sections spaced evenly through the book with sets of open-book and  closed-book problems and their answers. The MATLAB exercises are a joke,  and don't take advantage of this tool.<br />Although much effort has been  taken to descirbe the material and provide lots of feedback to the reader  about how well they are &quot;getting&quot; it, this book has absolutely  nothing in it to &quot;sell&quot; the material as interesting or practical.  Like crosswords, either you love it because you were born that way, or your  boss told you to learn it, or you're not part of the audience.	2000-03-28

Compared to Pierret there is less reader feedback in terms  of review and worked problems. Problems tend to be of the same type and  level. <br />Compared to Streetman (5th Edition) coverage is narrower, without  optoelectronic, microwave and power devices. For electrical engineers, this  greater focus is rewarded in Casey's book with in-depth introduction to  SPICE simulations of all covered devices. For MOSFETs focus is on level 1  and level 2 PSpice, with a description of higher models up to level 6,  BSIM3.<br />In addition to PSpice, the sales point for Casey is physics of  device operation. For example, it has solid discussions of intrinsic  carrier density (why doesn't simple formula agree with experiment?) and of  MOSFET threshold voltage. None of the other books come close for  authoritative, basic argument.	2000-03-28

These bad examples are fixed using useful general principles, like replacing names  for actions with verbs. <br />The focus is primarily on sentences with some  attention to paragraphs. The book &quot;The New Oxford Guide to  Writing&quot; by Thamas Kane is more ambitious in covering the organization  of larger documents and including a more varied approach to making text  interesting.<br />Bottom line: Williams to fix the egregious, Kane to make  things sing.	2000-01-13

For  example, the menu arrangement described in this book for inserting a module  sheet is different if you use Excel '97. The dialog sheet is used here for  designing dialog boxes, a method replaced with UserForms in Excel '97. So  although intended to be a very handholding approach, for users of Excel '97  it is no longer so straigtforward. Probably John Walkenbach's  &quot;Microsoft Excel 2000 Power Programming&quot; is more useful, but  unfortunately at a more advanced level.	1999-12-13

The useful aspect is the identification of many features of style unnoticed by me.<br />It may indicate the age of the author that on p. 32 he  recommends &quot;If you type .... Keep the keys clean and invest now and  then in a new ribbon.&quot; He has no special advice for users of a word  processor, and I'd guess he never used one. He refers to Webster's Seventh  New Collegiate Dictionary, which gives an idea of how new &quot;new&quot;  is. <br />I'd put this book at a high-school to first-year college level. The  author's style is that of a friendly and knowledgable advisor,  pedantic at  times, but usually not.<br />I found the examples really made the points, and  the overall view of techniques shows what can be done.	1999-11-23

It does not do enough to describe the context in which circuits arise, nor to describe the design process. It also fails to tell the reader what comes next: that is, where is all this going, what is our next course, and so forth. <br />Its strong point is a lot of problems that, if worked, should provide a good background for the student.	1998-07-24

It also integrates SPICE very well. The entry to the subject is careful to build context, explaining the role of signals and signal processing, and how the processing of signals leads to circuits. It also is careful to emphasize the design process and how it is related to SPICE and to analysis methods.<br />There are some sources of confusion, for example, Fig. 2.17(b) and Fig. 2.18(b) contain circuit elements pertaining to reverse bias of a diode that are never explained, including a diode symbol never introduced or explained. The discussion of a peak detector as a demodulator employs a series connection of voltage sources (p. 119) instead of a multiplication of the modulating and carrier waveforms.<br />Overall, an excellent introduction, more modern and much better at context and motivation than most.	1998-07-24

However, not nearly as many workarounds are provided as in the WORD Annoyances book. Also, large sections are copied verbatim. For example, the introductory VBA examples are the same as WORD Annoyances, although there are a few EXCEL specific VBA programs as well. The discussion of worksheet auditing (tracking down mistakes in entries) and organization of worksheets inside a workbook is better than most.	1998-07-14

Undoubtedly, developers will use VBA most often for this purpose.&quot; <br /> Despite the above remark, there is NOT ONE MORE WORD about this in the entire 922 pages.!.!<br />The term &quot;handbook&quot; as used, for example, in &quot;The Electrical Engineer's Handbook&quot; and tomes of that sort means a rather complete, though brief, coverage of an entire subject. In contrast, this book is a hodge-podge of program scraps that can be cut and pasted here and there in a real program. I can understand the enthusiasm of the reviewers that found exactly the tidbit they needed, but a better title would be &quot;Miscellaneous Program Excerpts using VBA&quot;.<br />   An exception to this generalization is Chapter 7 on error handling and debugging, which actually provides some understanding of these items. In fairness, there are myriad little details that can be useful to know. My main gripes are the omission of big areas, and the lack of a cohesive presentation.	1998-07-06

It begins at the beginning (What is a toolbar?)and goes on to Visual Basic. The main drawback of a book of this type is that it concentrates on describing features one after the other. Like reading a dictionary, knowing a lot of words doesn't mean you are developing fluency.<br />An exception to this remark is the last chapter in the book &quot;Sample Visual Basic Application&quot;. I'm a novice in this area, so experts might not agree with me. But I found this example really got my imagination. It describes a project that picks up data from an outside monitoring station on a regularly updated basis, puts it into EXCEL, generates a regularly updated chart, and makes a report using WORD. The entire sequence is automatic. This example puts EXCEL to work with other applications in a complex project showing me what is possible. Variations on this theme could be used for many other projects.	1998-07-01

Things like what might motivate Microsoft's decisions, historical figures and occurrences, the philisophical issues behind some software design. Personally I enjoyed these diversions, but they are not germane to learning VBA. From the learning standpoint, the author does not provide an approach that builds up step by step, as texts do. He believes in the immersion approach, dumping the reader in the deep end and providing enough help that you don't drown. However, only gradually do you grasp the situation and begin to piece it together. I'd say that this book will accomplish its purpose and contains a lot of pertenant info, but it does require patience, and a willingness to let the author ramble in the hopes that he is going somewhere.	1998-06-23

There are a number of features of EXCEL that are useful and are introduced in a sample problem context where you can see how it works. A trivial example is the use of ctrl + with a chart to produce a chart based on  the actual data and not the spreadsheet, saving tons of memory. I haven't found this trick anywhere else.  This book also provides a nice introduction to the basics of numerical methods, showing how they work and how EXCEL can be used with them. He shows how to use visual basic as well, and provides some useful examples. The author also provides references to other books and programs that complement his discussion.  This is the most useful EXCEL book that I have found. It is not entirely up to date, but that is not a real problem.	1998-06-15
