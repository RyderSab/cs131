I read this book 30 years ago, and I still think about it.  I can remember the xxxxxx, the xxxxx that xxxx the main character, the waves of xxxxx xxxxxx after the event...  the xxxx, the forced xxxx, the eventual shut down of the xxxxx xxxxx as the xxxxxxxxx started to xxxxx.  The shift from xxxxxxxxxx( for years) to xxxxxxx for themselves.<br /><br />The last breaths of the xxxxxxx and the xxxxxx  for the xxxxxxx, the xxxx which every year the xxxxxxx took up to the xxxxx and xxxxx the time since the xxxxx.<br /><br />30 Years.... and I still think about it.  How many books, movies, songs... etc... do you expect to think about 30 years down the road.  You probably wouldn't even remember the title let alone a rough outline.<br /><br />Will I read it again? Certainly!  I ran into a young lady reading this on the subway a few years back, and we had a wonderful conversation...  it's that kind of a book.<br /><br />SPOILAGE AVERTED --- Skol	2005-03-01

Dogs stretch when they sense the need, humans don't unless taught.  Dogs are amazing to watch, there are many things innate to dogs (and most animals), that humans don't do, but probably should.<br /><br />Breathing - Humans breath shallow inadequate, terse breaths.  Why?  Because we've forgotten how to breath correctly.<br /><br />How do we learn to breath correctly?  Well, at birth.  Once born the baby should be placed on the mother's chest, before the cord is severed and taught to breath.  There, feeling the breath come in and out of the mother, feeling the heart beat, the baby learns to breath.  Most mothers will have to ensure THEY are breathing correctly to pass this Vital Information onto the babe.<br /><br />Since dogs breath naturally, pups are brought close to the mother, umbilical chord usually intact and feel the breathing and the heartbeat and become one with the mother.<br /><br />Okay... think about it.  And that's precisely what this book does, it gets one thinking about things, that perhaps we normally wouldn't take the time nor have the inclination to discover.<br /><br />I enjoyed the read, it was cute, informative and being a dog owner I could relate.	2005-02-27

I've been down this road before.  Buy the book, get involved with it, learn a few things then forget them.  But, there is value here. Methods such as these do start the creative juices flowing, plus exercise your technical abilities.  I won't put too much weight on these methods, but Wolf Marshall has put out some wonderful aids for the developing guitarist.<br /><br />Choose those licks, or songs you like and rehearse those.  Developing a language of your own sounds easy. But it's not. It takes some time and a boat load of dedication.<br /><br />My hat is off to Wolf Marshall, he's jump starting the process, but you have to keep at it.  YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE TIME AND EFFORT.

Al Franken, the goof of SNL gets serious about stuff he used to joke about. Why isn't he joking about the biggest goof of all, Bill (goofy) Klintoon? Surely if Leno and Letterman and all the other successful late nighters can get a hoot out of the man, Al could at least quit the sychophant prattle towards the \\"previous\\" administration and talk about politics as a whole. Perhaps a 3 or 4 party system, maybe some constructive dialog towards real change and not perceptions based on \\"facts\\" that even the mighty Al Franken or Michael Moore are not privy to.<br /><br />My advice, read it! Accept it as fact and then go up to scholarly web sites and pull down both inferential and discriptive statistics on issues such as... the economy (for example). That would allow the reader a feel for what the term \\"intuitive\\" deduction means and how value added (wink wink) intuitive reasoning (such as this book) really is.<br /><br />It is an amusing read and Al Franken will always be, in my minds eye, an amusing fellow. Gosh, all the press and hullaballo couldn't have hurt either. Nothing like a media hype to boost the 'ol career, and probably at a time when (Al who?) needed one. After all his audience has shifted and the demongraphics for his talent has moved on to other venues.	2004-08-29

Being good security conscience people, they basically told me that they couldn't talk about it.  But, they suggested I read the Puzzle Palace for some insight.  So a number of years later I did.  It was interesting.  Working around communications for the better part of 30 years plus growing up around D.C., I was very familiar with some of the NSA, Army and OGA sites, which are written about in the book and could take you to those sites today.  But, time and technology has marched on.  Many of the sites from the 60's, 70's and 80's have been abandoned, and in Northern Virginia's march to cover the landscape with urban sprawl, are now shopping centers, housing developments or just plain abandoned.  Even a CG Base in California is the former location of the site where the Army intercepted Japanese communications regarding Pearl Harbor. So, to me the book was great.  It yielded the type of history in communications that marked WWII and the ensuing Cold War years.  Well, with advances in communications, satellites etc... much of the former infrastructure is outmoded and other technologies have taken their place.  For instance...  Norfolk Virginia, once home to a large communications center at the Naval Operations Base, employing hundreds of Navy Radiomen, is now a very large room occupied with a rack or two of computer gear.  Communications are no longer the labor-intensive operation it once was.  Computers do the routing and relaying, computer networks, uplinks and downlinks to satellites have replaced the Radio Communications of the past.  Quite a change from just 30, even 10 to 20 years ago.  The puzzle palace documents specific uses of that telecommunications system, in that it shows the reader the organization of secure communications, electronic intelligence gathering and associated operations.  I liked the book, yes it did read like a text, but I wasn't looking for a novel or a fiction.  As for the writers who claim this was pure fiction.  I believe they are flawed in their \\"expert\\" assessments.secure communications, electronic intelligence gathering and associated operations.

I'll make two statements here. Number one which I learned in Viet Nam and number two, which I figured out later after much reflection.  1) NEVER trust a young stupid officer (LTjg, 2nd LT etc...) and I mean any of them. 2) Some young stupid officers are no longer with us, because they were stupid enough to get a lot of good men killed including themselves.  Maybe it was a good thing Kerry was in country only 4 months. He probably saved some lives by exiting early.  It appears that Kerry was an apple polishing suck up during the war, and clearly sucked up to the darlings of the anti war movement after his service.  During the forthcoming election, when asked what he would have done different after 9/11 Kerry has already stated some specifics, well... why didn't he speak up?  We're at war, surely the President would have welcomed some seasoned advice. It's like we're in large boat and Kerry is rowing in the wrong direction.  I don't understand this, the legacy of rowing in the opposite direction still exists with this guy.  What is it about team work that Sen. John Kerry doesn't understand?

Let's pretend Mr. Moore is a philosopher...versus, say, a mathematician.  In order for the mathematician to work, it would take three things 1) a pencil, 2) paper, and 3) a wastebasket.  For a philosopher it would take 2 things 1) a pencil, and 2) paper.  There are absolutely no absolutes (wink wink) in what Moore does for a living, which is lie, lie some more and present skewed statistics, which he either is a genius at manipulating or he's utterly devoid of basic concepts in statistical research.  The latter of which, I would bet cash on.<br /><br />But I'm not going to rail against Michael Moore; he's feeding the propaganda-starved masses.  He employs techniques, which rival tyrannical approaches to subliminal seduction, and at the very least Moore possesses an adept feel for dialectic discourse leaving the audience either without an opinion or highly in favor of his reasoning.  It's an art form; Goebbels was pretty good at it as was, Mao, Stalin and the whole gang of \\"liberating\\" souls who have graced the planet in last 250 or 300 years.<br /><br />In summary, this book details the simple fact that Michael Moore is a propagandist, and by doing so, (strangely enough) puts itself in the same category, as it hypes the opposing thinkers.  I tend to go with the facts on most subjects, especially theoretical mathematics, number theory and other subjects, which are proven through the exactness of the methodology.  Moore does not do this... so in essence I take his point of view with raised eyebrow.  My ultra-left wing Hippie cousin in the 60's once asked me \\"do you believe everything you read?\\" If memory serves he was referring to the Washington Post at the time-- funny how that sort of panned out.  The flagship newspaper for liberal thought is rather tough to believe, just as the man the Washington Post heralds (Michael Moore), is also tough to believe.	2004-08-14

Budget, schedule, source selection, contract management, program & technology management... it seems at times--overwhelming.  Managing projects of this scope are like juggling chainsaws, especially when wrapped so tightly with budget and schedule, or changing schedules as technology changes and emerges during the course of an acquisition.  Then it's rework and modifications to contract, it's extreamly dynamic! Interconnectivity along the differing nodes (USN, USAF, USA, USMC, USCG, HQ, Pentagon...) was incredible. Defense contracting is HUGE, INNOVATIVE and it's NOT like running a sandwich shop or a gas station. Totally different realm. Just the technological advances from 1992 to 2000 were staggering, managing that aspect of the acquisition took strict attention to detail and a hand on the pulse of the industry. No sense fielding a system which needs a major technology upgrade 2 years after FRP.<br /><br />  Remember Winter 2003? I couldn't believe the press questions during tactical updates... if they had read THIS book they would have completely understood the capability, innovation and the battlefield overview the ARMY possessed. Instead we get the usual uninformed prattle about how bad the losses were going to get, or how will our Army ever survive the onslaught of the RNG. The U.S. owned the night, had total control over every aspect associated with the dissemination of the opposing forces.<br />  Example: in 1992 it took 10 minutes to acquire and put ordnance on a target. In 2003 it took 2 minutes, 45 seconds of which was the time the ordnance was in the air enroute to impact. That's impressive, that's technology at work, that's why this book is a must read for every business major or military professional or... the press.<br /><br />  Otherwise, you're just uninformed.	2004-08-02

Witnessing to people for many years, this book has sent a powerful message out to all who have taken the time to read it. Believe it not, this book used to be required reading in many High Schools across America.<br />I found this book on the Washington Monument (Mall) grounds July 4th in the early 70's after the police broke up a very large demonstration (i.e. very large dope smoking party) against the war in Viet Nam. The place was littered with many items left after a &quot;hippy vs police&quot; riot broke out (the hippies actually stated fighting among themselves, I remember hundreds of coke bottles flying through the air); the police intervened by deploying tear gas and tactics...battling the demonstrators up Pennsylvania Avenue. It was an exciting day, but it also proved to be a day which my eyes were truly opened to the power of Lord... after I started to read the worn copy I had found in the mud. I couldn't put it down. This book opened the eyes of my understanding in so many ways, and started my path towards the recovery from the battlefields of southeast asia, from the struggle to survive in the brutal climate of war. From the conflicts of doing my job as a warrior, and seeing the death and destruction of lives all around me -- I was a shell of what I should have been at 25, a survivor a fighter, enduring the ravages of the human race and coming out physically capable but mentally tormented. This book started my comeback, my recovery, my search, my seeking and showed me an open door which, once I entered in, I was given my life back. I can never forget that, I can only praise God for the redemption and revelation.	2004-07-05

Secondly, you will need the CD's or source material needed to pick up on the nuances that Jaco employs through dynamics, touch and feeling. Thirdly -- you will need time.  Acquaint yourself with the music then start hitting the book.  Not wanting to play anything note for note like some sort of automotron, I choose rather to go for the feel.  Afterall, can one really achieve each individual percussive attack or note?  I hope not!  If you can then buy an old beater Fender Fretless, drop in .9mf Cap, make sure the pickups supply the necessary Low, Mids and Trebs... change your roto-sounds weekly pick up an acoustic 360 amp and go for it.  If not... go for the feel.  The selections are good and cover a wide range of material and styles. It is enjoyable to get inside the music a bit.	2004-02-26

This Comforter is the Holy Spirit which enables one to heal, it's not Smith Wigglesworth who heals, but the Holy Spirit working through Smith Wigglesworth.  The experiences and emotions Mr. Wigglesworth bears during his walk with the Lord are expressed in his writings.  This is not an autobiography, it's the words he put down expressing the experience of having the Holy Spirit work through him.	2004-02-18

Interesting study of the history of diets and the gradual shifting of man from a hunter/gatherer to civilized culture.  Mr. Audette makes a good case, in my opinion, through studies of Inuit medical records, anthopological remains etc...<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the chapters detailing man's ability to hunt, the adaptation of wolves (dogs) in the hunt and how domestication of both animals and crops changed our diets and health.  Based on the study of remains through the ages, those changes and the processes involved in making domesticated goods edible, may not have been favorable to the human.	2003-02-01

The up's the down's, the trials and tribulations, the known and unknown quirks...  the beautiful life of Louis Armstrong.  He lived through a tough period in American history.  Yet he managed to always remain upbeat, polite and (naturally) highly innovative.  This quintessential entertainer of the 20th century was the backbone of what we, today call Jazz. Mr. Louis Armstrong had a few bedeviling idiosyncrasies, but don't we all.  His were relatively benign compared to some of his contemporaries.  A wonderful read. I can't give it a proper review... you're just going to have to read it!	2003-01-26

This one works, I've tried them all and over the years watched a lot of friends maintain carb-loading diets and all of them have grown out of their workout cloths.  Okay, to be fair, nutrition and weight gain is proportionate to the amount of effort expending during exercise.  But a lot of folks are eating carbs in quantities only serious marathon runners would dare to ingest.  In other words, the nutritionists have sold us a pyramid, which is VERY heavy on carbs (when unused are stored as FAT) and not enough leafy greens or protein.  Do you want muscle mass?  Protein does it.  Check out a few other selections too, such as Protein Power or Neandrathin.  I like Protein Power because it really expresses the \\"burn\\" in a studied way.  But the Atkin's explains the diet in an easy almost non-scientific way.  If you want the studied explanation go to Protein Power and read it there.<br />Lots of reviewers are aghast that someone would promote meat, that's knee jerk reactionism.  A key point to be regarded is... veggies are also included in sufficient quantities, PURE WATER is promoted, CAFFIEN is out.  Sugars are out and Carbs, which turn to glucose, are also out.  Sounds like a good healthy way to provide your body with nutrients if you ask me.  I've used this diet for years.  Yes you do lose you're taste for sweets, but it takes a couple of weeks (if you eat a lot of sweets to begin with).  But, hey, junk food isn't good for you.  Also, stick with unprocessed foods.  Processing tends to add sugar and other fillers that inhibit your systems transition into the burn mode.  Go fish, go chicken, go seafood, what ever.  But go for it!  It's worth the ability to really control your weight.	2002-06-18

Hemingway argued that it was Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, which identified the American novel and that particular style or writing by individuals now referred to as American writers.<br />Andrew Pham, combines both a sense of journalistic license with some stylistic American writing in Catfish and Mandala. Which struck me as rather interesting. Searching for his roots, a sense of self, who and where he came from all cumulated from his ability and sense of the American literary style.<br />Mr. Pham may disagree after all, it is his writing style, but that is how it reads to me. Personally, I find his style very good -- captivating me from start to finish.<br />Other reviews on this book talk about the events of the story, I prefer to examine the style of this work. Again, Andrew Pham has accomplished a major breakthrough in his writing career with this one. It's read in colleges, book clubs, by bicyclists, travel buffs and tourists -- just to name a few. His style flows throughout the work... but the end just sort of happens.  I thought perhaps an additional 100 pages or so may have moved the story of the trip and the introspection he experienced along a smoother path.  So the ending just sort of happened and I was left a little perplexed...  sort of like the end of a Clapton song -- no \\"outro\\" just \\"blat\\" and it's over.<br />For the readers interest please note that this work has been well received by both the 2000 Whiting Writers Award and the 1999 Kiriyama (Pacific Rim Book Prize). Thank you Mr. Pham. Thank you.	2002-04-09

Successful Musician, gifted, genius, thunderbolt from heaven, then poof, they self destruct and are gone long before they should be... yet are memorialized because of the ground they broke. Bix Beiderbeck, Jimi Hendrix, Chet Baker, Charlie Parker etc...<br />While this book covers the basic time line information, it doesn't really get to deep below the surface. Perhaps because there are too many people too fond of Jaco.<br />Should the journalist delve deeply or just run a shallow narrative concerning the life and times of Jaco Pastorius? Jaco had severe problems which led to his untimely death. While he was taken early in a altercation outside of a bar... he had already pushed the self destruct button and appeared to be beyond anyone's reach.<br />Sadly, no one came forward to really help this suffering soul. A few tried, and yes the responsibility ultimately rests with the individual, but Jaco was in need of some serious tough lov., Could it have worked? We'll never know.<br />Rest peacefully Jaco, you WERE loved and ARE missed.	2001-12-31

And, this instruction delves the musician in exactly those techniques at the root level.  It will require study and lots of time to incorporate the presented material into ones muscial psyche.  The CD has become a staple of instruction material as of late, and that is the GOOD news.  A great teaching aid and one (perhaps the only one for Bongo) which should not be ignored.  The tools are here.  Like all musical studies just add diligence and practice time and you won't be disappointed.	2001-07-31
