US	49374774	R3628ONT39ES6Y	051505495X	872579289	Pivot	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A NY Skyscraper, a lovely September day, an unimaginable plan of destruction - 1944	In \\"Pivot\\" (which I first read in 1988!!), the Nazis plan a daring strike to bring the war to America's home soil.  With a V-2 missile (the crude yet effective and destructive ancestor of the modern ICBM) towed across the Atlantic in a special barge by a souped-up U-Boat, the Germans aim to strike at the Empire State Building in the heart of Manhattan.  If the Germans succeed, the Americans will have to redeploy their naval forces in defense of homeland shores against further attacks (they were probably stretched to the breaking point fighting U-Boats on the open seas) thus weakening the forces they can commit on other fronts.  While real V-2's were notoriously inaccurate, the ones in this book use a special seeker head attuned to follow a radio beacon to be placed on the target by a German spy - ensuring a direct hit.  No precaution is spared to ensure success and secrecy, even though the Americans don't even know to look for them. <br /> <br />\\"Pivot\\" was an unforgettable book - even if I couldn't remember the author or title, I recalled enough details to confirm it was the same book when I reencountered it recently.  More than just the basic attack plot, \\"Pivot\\" spices things up by following (and seldom escaping) the harrowing confines of the submarine.  We get the crusty U-Boat vet dragooned into the mission by an old friend (now a powerful Nazi) who needs a favor; we get powerful Nazi's spoiled brat of a son who is the sub's XO; and then we get the spy, the young man tasked with planting the special radio that will lead the Nazi terror weapon into the heart of New York City.  \\"Pivot\\" is a slim tale, yet satisfying - giving you the big picture while keeping your mind on the main characters.  (The novel does have a POV problem, switching from chapter to chapter between third and first person narratives.)  The technology and its implications is plausibly mapped out, so the tension is real.  All in all, a solid WWII actioner that delivers the goods.	2005-09-28
US	49374774	R1G7M7Z6FD32NK	0553049763	464619665	The R Document	Books	2	1	4	N	N	shallow political novel	\\"The R Document\\" is one of those novels that reviewers like to hale as \\"topical today as it was when published\\", though it's actually one of those novels that proves that the width of the gap between \\"topical\\" and \\"relevant\\" remains as wide today as it was in 1980.  Set during a politically and socially unstable era in American history, Wallace's novel seemingly posits a debate between those Americans who believe that freedom is the price of law and order on the one side, and those Americans who see the equation the other way around.  On the one side is Tynan, an FBI director pushing for a new constitutional amendment that may gut the bill of rights.  Our hero is the brave Attorney General - who supports the amendment, but has his doubts.  When the AG's son provides more than doubts with which to oppose the Amendment, the AG finds himself the target of intimidation and (not soon thereafter) outright extortion.  Can our hero find that one piece of...something that will blow Tynan out of the water and save freedom for America? <br /> <br />Like I said, there's a big difference between topical - which pays lip service to an issue - and relevant - which actually deals with the issue.  Though pointing towards the debate, \\"R Document\\" is more concerned with its own cardboard characters - we pretty much know which way the novel will go once we realize where each of the characters will stand on the issue.  Instead of arguing over the true values of freedom and order, the novel instead dwells on the virtues of characters who engage in dirty tricks.  As in any number of Alan Drury novels, the characters talk politically while never embodying the principles underlying either side of the political divide.  There's a sort of surprise ending - which again does nothing to answer the underlying debate of freedom v. honor.  The plot never feels like it's going anywhere, and Wallace takes this stuff to seriously to make it as much fun as \\"The Plot\\".	2005-09-27

The Lady of the title is a virtual clone of the American President's wife - living unfortunately in Russia.  The Lady is stumbled upon by the Soviets' spymaster who hits upon a daring idea: swap the two - if temporarily - to give them access to the President's innermost secrets.  Specifically, they need to determine whether the Americans have really beefed up the military position of an embattled and US-Backed African nation.  As the Russian spy gains access, she soon realizes that it may take more than looks to pass for the president's wife. <br /> <br />So why is this novel so bad?  The cardboard characters typical to novels like this are in attendance, but it's the premise that makes this an unlikely read.  The idea behind the Russian lady is problematic because it was unnecessarily made as implausibly as possible - instead of working at some secret soviet lab, there just happens to be a Russian woman who looks like the wife of the most powerful man in the free world, and she just happens to catch the eye of the head of the KGB.  Just to reassure jaded readers, we're told that the real first lady is an avid skinny-dipper, allowing Russian spy-photographers to verify in pictures what file photos at Reuters will not.  (More intelligent readers wonder how the First Lady's predilections survived our ruthless press.)  The Soviets get so used to having the plot go there way, that when a problem crops up, they seem to miss the simplest solution. (The Russians, despite their dossier on the President's wife, miss an embarrassing detail about the lady's current medical condition; when they learn that there's a problem after having made the switch, they go to desperate lengths to get details, even though they have the First Lady in their power and can have one of their own doctors find out what's wrong).  Most of the Irving Wallace novel's I've read are rife with plot howlers, but the good ones (like \\"The Plot\\") actually work on their implausibility and have enough fun characters that they work.  To its credit, \\"Lady\\" ends on a smart twist ending, but it's one that seems undeserved by this contrived book.	2005-09-27

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Really entitled "Sea Leopard"	Rather than direct you to the proper page, I'll just review \\"Sea Leopard\\" here. <br /> <br />\\"Sea Leopard\\" refers to a revolutionary device for immunizing submarines against detection.  When the novel opens, it's already been loaded on the RN submarine Proteus.  It's the cutting edge for submarines, but the British believe the system virtually compromised - thinking that the Russians have already kidnapped its inventor.  The black-joke is on the British - the Soviets haven't nabbed Leopard's creator yet.  Instead, they plan to grab both the scientist and his invention simultaneously - the latter in an act of unprecedented piracy below the waves. <br /> <br />\\"Sea Leopard\\", set within the same continuity as \\"Firefox\\" is a great CT novel - it's fast, and has his trademark deft character descriptions and terse dialog.  Though not a submariner, Thomas gives \\"Leopard\\" a great feel for its surroundings - the forbidding wastes of the North Sea, the close confines of a submarine, the situation rooms of either side (where digital symbols dance on Perspex screens like fireflies) - making you feel like you're a part of the action, even if much of the action seems to stretch credibility.  \\"Sea Leopard\\" is solid reading, cover-to-cover.	2005-09-27
US	49374774	R2BGRC0QSAOCR7	0671125087	945247587	The Plot	Books	4	0	0	N	N	preposterous, yet immensely satisfying	In The Plot, a group of characters having apparently little personally to do with each other, converge on Paris to right old wrongs and end up saving the world from a massive conspiracy. <br /> <br />Our heroes include Matt, a once famous White House aide now exiled from America because of his role in \\"allowing\\" an American nuclear-weapons expert to defect to Red China; Emmet, a former President, modeled after Eisenhower, already living in obscurity but now threatened with a darker place in history for his role in that same nuclear scandal; Jay, a former internationally recognized print journalist now going to fat writing cookbooks (also in obscurity) in Vienna; Hazel, Jay's estranged lover and one-time pupil, who now surpasses him, but can't get past him; and Medora Hart, a young British girl living in exile in France for her role in a Profumo-like sex-scandal involving high-ranking British Politicians.  <br /> <br />Sharing nothing besides being losers, each of our heroes suddenly discovers that the key to their salvation may be waiting for them in Paris where America, China and Russia have gathered to hold disarmament talks. For Matt, it means the chance to reunite with a Soviet diplomat who can prove Matt was not to blame for allowing the Chinese a toe-hold in the nuclear club; For Emmett, it means the chance to talk an embittered and dying German munitions magnate out of publishing memoirs that will hold the ex-president accountable for allowing the Chinese a nuclear arsenal; For Jay, it means reuniting with Hazel and uncovering proof she hinted at years earlier of Russian involvement in the Kennedy assassination, proof that will bring Jay back the journalistic stardom now only a memory; For Hazel, it means the chance to scoop her competitors and escape Jay's shadow; And for Medora, it means that Paris will be full of British diplomats, including the one who tricked her into leaving England and then yanked her citizenship.  <br /> <br />None of our heroes connects their plight to the underlying summit that has drawn diplomats of the world's most powerful nations to Paris to decide the fate of the world. Darker powers are at work, aimed at reshaping a larger chunk of the world than that inhabited by any one of our protagonists.  <br /> <br />Except that this is Irving Wallace, and, despite being over 500 pages long, a series of impossibly contrived plot devices brings our heroes together first and then to the realization that more is involved than any of their petty desires. In fact, what drives the book, and makes it both improbable and enjoyable is that our loser heroes really are losers who would couldn't nab the last metro let alone uncover the Sino-Soviet conspiracy. Instead, our heroes would wander aimlessly through Paris (much of the book reads like a travelogue) while salvation continues to elude them. Our heroes are so dim, that when they realize the possibility that a larger plot even exists, the development is abrupt, almost atypical for them, and the novel would collapse right then if the author hadn't already suspended our belief for hundreds of pages. Examples of such howlers - Hazel's Russian lover hints at Soviet backing for the Kennedy assassination, but Hazel sits on the story for years; At a gathering of global gluttons, a Russian cookbook author accidentally spills the beans that the Russians and Chinese have been meeting together for years, despite the fact that the two powers are bitter enemies and the fact that the Russians can't cook lo-mein to save their lives; Blame for the Chinese defection falls squarely on Matt, a young, idealistic diplomat, with none being reserved for the president; When nothing tips our heroes off to the existence of the Sino-Soviet plot, Medora picks up more clues in an overheard conversation spoken between the wives of Communist Chinese diplomats - in English!  <br /> <br />Any one of the above would kill the book, yet Wallace makes his characters incredibly fallible yet gifted in instinct. They're dim like us, but have pluck and can piece together clues that we can't making them - and us - seem smarter than they have a right to be. It's almost as if Wallace were including his readers in his schemes. Toss in Paris and the fate of the free world, and the Plot delivers.	2005-09-18
US	49374774	R20LDAR7P8ZCCO	0523403658	52496529	Sunstrike	Books	1	0	0	N	N	non-story	The only memorable character in \\"Sunstrike\\" is a famed Physicist who (as I read it) looked and sounded a lot like Dr. Zarkov from the original \\"Flash Gordon\\" serials - a true-blue mad scientist who's only made less mad by his un-real surroundings.  The scientist, apparently respected around the world, has a hidden agenda that's apparent to readers immediately, even if it misses the brilliant scientists and students he spends time with - another example of technothrillers populated by characters who are geniuses without having to be all that smart.  Under the pretext of inventing a new plastic that shields astronauts from deadly cosmic rays, he plunges the world into a new ice-age.  In the mean time, a class of his brightest students is kept safe (and oblivious from the frosty apocalypse above) in a mountain shelter as part of what they think is an experiment, but what is obviously part of the Doctor's plan to repopulate Earth with their descendants.  Feeling the time right, the Doctor commandeers a prototype spaceship and sets off to start a new ice age.  Enwrapped by sheaths of the Doctor's plastic placed in orbit, Earth turns into a huge snowball, with civilization freezing to death.  Knowing that the growing catastrophe has something to do with the Doctor (both he and the one-of-a-kind spaceship go missing at the same time) scientists on Earth seem hard-pressed to determine just what the problem is.  Can they pierce the secret in time? <br /> <br />Just about every page of \\"Sunstrike\\" begs you to stop reading - consign it to a dustbin.  We're supposed to fear for the safety of the world, but the Earth of this novel already seems to have suffered a mass-extinction of real characters.  Also, despite the premise, there's no real plot - much of the stuff here just happens.  Rather than create any real challenges, the author just greases the wheels - the spaceship can land and launch like an airplane, has nearly unlimited fuel and its computers allow it to be flown byanybody (I recall the author using a monkey as the example).  The Villain fools his brilliant colleagues, but luckily for us - and true to mad-scientist form - documents the entire plan and leaves it in a safety-deposit box.  The logic of this fits the rest of the book - the scientist conveniently blabbing about a plan he presumably knows about, and leaving it where only he knows (not counting on the memory of a bank employee) is just one of many leaps that you'll be asked to make before finishing this book.  Another knit-pick is the setting - it's Earth, not quite futurstic, but not present-day either.  The author tosses in celebrity names to give the thing a sense of verimilitude that seems quaint nearly 30 years later (Mondale is president).  In short, give yourself a dose of Coppertone, and toss this tome to the shade...	2005-08-31
US	49374774	R1ZVSATW4NY0EB	0517685485	930909953	Diary of a Yuppie	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Neither a diary nor about Yuppies (important)	\\"Diary of a Yuppie\\", by Louis Auchincloss fails at being either a diary or a compelling portrait of a Yuppie.  Rather than a genuine diary - a journal of daily goings on, both mundane and monumental and always exhibiting the narrator's consignment to the prison of the here and now - \\"Diary\\" is simply a short-term excerpt from the life of Bob Service.  Service, a Manhattan corporate attorney, is prodded by his wife to begin documenting his life before it reaches the dramatic crossroads detailed in this book.  Service is virtually a self-made man - there's no doubt he burnt some serious elbow-grease in his journey from less-than white-shoe origins, but the critical moves were made by colleagues and his aged mentor - people that Service will easily use and discard.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the premise of a diary - which is compelling for men like Service whose lives embrace so many possibilities - is lost here.  A real diary documents the events of the day oblivious to the impact those events will have on the future.  Rather than a cohesive narrative, a diary is by definition a string of separate narratives linked by a common narrator.  Some days may compliment each other, but many frustrate each other.  Plans are left and come to naught, or are defeated by whatever outrageous fortune comes with the next day.  Also, the narrator has an excuse/duty to be as oblivious to the inner workings of the story as anybody else, as well as subjective and self-centered.  A diary is very much an anti-novel, with unique opportunities for plot-twists and deliciously painful irony.  Service, incongruously for a selfish and unlikable oaf, is pretty objective, and Auchincloss clumsily allows Service to use foreshadowing or other dramatic touches with which to clue us to the story's direction.  Service isn't an inconsiderate guy - he knows the painful consequences others will bear for his actions - he simply doesn't care about them. <br /> <br />Also misplaced is the label of Yuppie- Service just doesn't fit that label at all.  He's selfish but not really shallow.  Although the novel describes Service's lowly origins, nothing in his character informs Service's being an outsider to the old-money surroundings of his law firm and circle of friends.  He reads Wadsworth rather than Tama Janowitz and Jay Mcinerney favored by Yuppies who read any books when they weren't listening to their pitiful CD's (shallow magazines fit their hectic schedules and their need to pattern their appearances; for a Yuppie, Service seldom concerns himself with his looks) and gives little clue of the avarice or guttsiness that meant survival and wealth for the yuppies or corporate lawyers of the mid-80's.  Rather than over-ambitious, Service is just purposelessly callous.  He's not even self-centered enough to remain the moral universe of his own diary - he yields that to his wife.  Service's circle is status-hungry, but closer to that old-money set that the Yuppies were dead-set on destroying.  Auchincloss' yuppie is the last guy in the world you'd see lighting up - let alone inhaling. The hero's cultural background is too old-fashioned for those homo-sapiens who brought CD's to the market and fought the stigmas of multiple bankruptcy or early retirement. Even the idea of a journal seems closer to the self-absorbed slacker 1990's than the yuppie's that Auchincloss wants to portray. <br /> <br />As a poorly conceived depiction of Yuppie-dom, \\"Diary\\" fails to satisfy, with the hero's moral dilemmas involving less of the hero than his reaction to the sufferings of others - abandoned law partners, ex-wives, colleagues and relatives. This is the novel where the hero's greatest challenege is whether to stick with the upper-crust law firm that had nurtured him from law school or make the break for something new. Pack it in your Beamer and forget about it.	2005-08-26

The best story is not \\"Blue Rose\\" by Straub, but the haunting and heartbreaking \\"Little Cruelties\\" by Steve Rasnic Tem.  Unlike most stories that save an obvious twist for the end, \\"Cruelties\\" makes the end obvious by the middle, and ruthlessly underlines it by the end of the story.  \\"Blue Rose\\", probably one of the first stories (and the one that got the cover) is just manipulative - one of two stories (and not even the better one) linking horror with Vietnam.  In '86, When \\"Rose\\" was written, Vietnam was grist for everybody's mill - TV shows, movies and even comic books relentlessly sipped from the well of Vietnam-as-metaphor - and \\"Rose\\" callously exploits cultural prejudices of the war as a breeding ground for the darkest of American monstrosity.  Bloch alters the mood with a middling-to-fun tale about a man who tries to work out a deal with the Grim Reaper, and learns just what Death's favorite weapon really is.  Few of the stories here (including a high-concept film-noir style horror story by Barker) stand out.  Virtually all the stories are plagued by association - in a book full of horror stories, you've no doubts that you'll see only the stuff that has to happen in horror stories (serial killers with psychotic mothers; dank corners of hell; demons to name a few).  Not even \\"Jack the Ripper\\" can add much bite to this story - he appears in an extended, yet painfully underwritten story that has all the hallmarks of a work-in-progress.	2005-08-15

The novel opens on a lazy summer night - Enid and Rebecca are long-time friends who've just graduated high school.  Neither thinks much beyond the oddities of the previous day - most revolving around this diner frequented by them and the cartoonish characters that share their world (a singularly odd looking couple Enid quickly determines to be satanic; a cheery and chatty white supremacist and misanthrope, an enigmatic seer named Bob Skeats, hookers and their Johns).  Though their world is alive with outrageous amusement, Enid and Rebecca themselves embody self loathing and frustration.  Though they're friends, it's soon clear that Enid & Rebecca don't much like each other or themselves, and mask that mutual disaffection with a more overt dislike of the rest of the planet.  The story starts off funny.  Having graduated HS, they're faced with an endless summer - which they fill by harassing and exploiting Josh (a young boy about their age who seems immune to have long grown immune to them) and other acts of capricious destruction.  At times \\"Ghost World\\" doesn't seem to even be a single story at all - instead of loose episodes.  As the summer does near its end, forcing Enid and Rebecca to consider future lives that don't include each other, the story becomes darker.  A prank involving a single man and a \\"personals\\" ad ends on an ugly note; both girls discard Josh emotionally, even as they come to realize how much he means to them; and the differences between Enid and Rebecca, which made the two of them individuals, tear them apart.  Rebecca seems content to never change who she is, move from where she is or discover anything new.  Enid reveals that her obsession is about change - she wants to become something else because she can't stand who she is.  I'm not going to say that \\"Ghost World\\" manages to be funny while being emotionally complex- like Enid, it undergoes a transformation of its own. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ IT: \\"Ghost World\\" displays a range of emotional depth that is uncommon even in \\"underground\\" comics.  Much of what you'll see is weird, gross or downright inexplicable - but the emotional cohesiveness grabs hold of you early on.  Though the story focuses on the relationship of two girls, it never becomes a comics version of \\"Teen People\\".  The story bravely focuses on characters who aren't that likable and don't become touchstones of topical discussion.  I can't say I'm glad to have read GW, but I'd hate to have missed it.	2005-08-12

Books	5	0	0	N	N	Unsurpassed technothriller	This is it - the original \\"Firefox\\", the first and arguably best of the high-speed technothrillers.  Though not greatly served by the 1982 Clint Eastwood movie, \\"Firefox\\" is still a must-read that elevates the techno-thriller to fine literature. <br /> <br />The Plot: deceptively simple.  Some time between the end of the Viet Nam war and 1982 (when Yuri Andropov still heads the KGB) the Soviets perfect the ultimate warplane - the MiG-31, NATO codenamed \\"Firefox\\".  Invisible on radar, capable of attaining speeds five times faster than sound, and driven by a thought-controlled fire-control system, the new plane easily exceeds anything on Western drawing boards.  As made clear in a flurry of memos between western intelligence sources, the Soviets have left the free-world one chance to even the gap: against all odds, steal Firefox! <br /> <br />Until that point, \\"Firefox\\" sounds like a conventional thriller - guys in suits with medals direct warplanes and other military toys.  But \\"Firefox\\" excels in its characters - chiefly that of Mitchell Gant, the American chosen to snatch the MiG.  Hardly the ideal hero of your typical novel, and not quite as you'd expect a fighter-pilot to look or sound - Gant inexplicably triumphs over every challenge, including himself.  Burnt out after an horrific experience in Viet Nam, Gant seemed like a man who'd never fly again - until the CIA plucks him out of obscurity and readies him for a mission with very little chance for survival.  In Thomas's uncompromising prose, Gant is a mixture of cynicism, self-destruction and conceit - he harbors less hope than his superiors do of him ever getting out of Russia alive, but never fails to take pride for his accomplishments.  Thomas excels in never letting his human characters (even the secondary, or tertiary ones) get sidelined by his props.  Even so, the \\"Firefox\\" itself is amazing piece of hardware - and almost becomes a character in its own right.  While many technothriller authors claim thattheir books put you in the pilot's seat, few have achieved that to the same degree that Thomas does here - with his deft descriptions of whipping G-Forces, dropping few levels and the other challenges of air combat.  With \\"Firefox Down\\" and \\"Winterhawk\\" Thomas fashioned a loose trilogy of books starring the character of Gant - each providing more than enough reason not to miss a single Thomas novel.	2005-08-07

More likely to please those who loved his other books, \\"Crow\\" follows the story arcs begun in prior books (the South African connection from \\"Last Raven\\"; the perfidy of turncoat Babbington from \\"Bear's Tears\\", AKA \\"Lion's Run\\") and never stitches a sufficiently coherent plot from its many intriguing threads.   <br /> <br />Babbington, unhappy in his Soviet exile, plots with his new colleagues to loot an Anglo high-tech firm of its technology.

Meanwhile, Richard Anderson, a former British operative living a gentle life of retirement in South Africa, discovers a crashed cargo plane in the middle of the desert.  The sand-covered tomb houses high-tech cargo and a dead pilot with a KGB ID card.

Barely surviving, Anderson turns to his old habits of \\"an operative\\" in hopes of learning who is behind the assault that claims his wife.  He also hopes for revenge.

It does lack the underlying threat of something big (like a Soviet coup from \\"Snow Falcon\\" or orbiting laser weapons from \\"Winterhawk\\") and it's difficult to get motivated by high-tech weaponry that exists only to be pursued but don't otherwise effect the story.  For fans comfy with Thomas's prose, \\"Crow\\" offers the climax of the Babbington story arc, as well as an intriguing transformation of Anderson and the ruthless efficiency of Patrick Hyde.	2005-07-22

Dan Lenson, the hero/antihero of Poyer's books, is in Caribbean aboard the USS Barret.  Unlike the rustbuckets of previous Lenson commands, Barret is a next-generation wonder - a sea-going computerized weapons system.  Unfortunately, the computer is bug-ridden, requiring a landlubber-civilian to be stationed on board the newly commissioned ship.  Poyer's plot includes a captain suspected of being gay, possible sabotage, murder and the Russians.  It's the cold-war 1980's, but Poyer doesn't just say so - he deftly draws the contemporary picture and lets it come alive.  The novel works because Poyer also brings alive the various crew of the Barret - angry, suspicious or just hard working.  Poyer never lets the action get stale, even though most of it is episodic.  There's less of the naval jargon than you'd expect - and what's left doesn't get in the way of the story.  This is only one of Poyer's novels dedicated to Dan Lenson of the USN, but it stands on its own feet and is easily a great entry for those who've read none of the other Lenson books.	2005-07-19

Time was, you didn't need the sub-title, since the story's focus was enough to clue readers in to who and what the story was about.  In \\"Cuba\\", the story involves a dying Castro, those among his followers vying for power (or for more than that), the weapons that he's leaving behind, and those determined to make sure the inevitable/imminent transition from Castro will be either as peaceful or as chaotic as possible.  Rather than become anybody's story, \\"Cuba\\" becomes a debut of sorts for master safecracker Tommy Carmelini (now to have his own Coonts franchise).  It also features corrupt Cuban politicians, bureaucratic Americans, an American fighter who just can't score, and a Cuban MiG pilot (actually, he's *the* Cuban fighter pilot) who's as much a loser on the ground as he is an ace in the air.  None of these characters ever becomes as full-bodied as the supporting characters of \\"Intruder\\", and none become the focus of the story.  There are so many sub-plots (missing Cuban bullion, bio-weapons, Castro's replacement, ancient-yet-dangerous Russian missiles, craven American bureaucrats) that none ever becomes an interesting focus on which to build tension.  The novel ends on a bit of an anti-climax.  I can appreciate that Coonts wanted to avoid a \\"Hollywood Ending\\" for his novel, but couldn't have left something that made the story memorable - some reminder of why anybody picked this story up at all?	2005-07-18

Quietly but decidedly, Japan has fallen under the control of an ultra-nationalistic cabal of militarists (is there any other kind?) who decide to go where their 1930's ancestors did not.  Using next-generation avionics (actually, they rely on a stolen version of ATHENA, the active stealth system up for grabs in \\"Minotaur\\") Japanese warplanes overwhelm the Russian forces of Siberia already strapped by a crippled economy.  Despite the fact that Russia itself is under the sway of an utter paranoid psychotic (or maybe for that very reason) the Americans decide that the Japanese must not succeed, and dispatch a squadron of F-22 fighters flown by vets who volunteer themselves out of retirement for various reasons.  Meanwhile, a Russian sub - a diesel-electric - stages daring attacks on Japan.  Meanwhile, a Russian fighter-pilot manages to survive whatever the Japanese can send his way.  Meanwhile, the paranoid-psychotic Russian leader decides he's not content with fighting an almost entirely defensive war.  Meanwhile... <br /> <br />Meanwhile is actually the problem with this novel.  It develops many threads that could easily support a single novel if Coonts had taken the time and energy to develope them.  Instead, he throws them all into a single book too slim to allow any of them breathing room.  We get just enough of the plucky Russian fighter pilot, the brutally effective Russian Sub skipper, the Yankee fighter pilots and fighter-pilot Bob Cassidy to remind just how interesting they could have been had either of them been the star of a novel with the same power of perspective of Jake Grafton.  We get more than enough of the crazy Russian leader to remind us that Coonts is at play in Dale-Brown country, where the bad guys areconveniently out of their minds.  Coonts changes direction so many times, it's easy to forget who this story is about.  Coonts seems to have forgotten as well - early on, as Bob Cassidy tracks down the volunteers who will volunteer to fight the Japanese, we get the brief life stories of each volunteer.  Once Cassidy assembles his fighter pilots in Russia, however, they disappear as coherent, individual characters, and then disappear entirely.  What was the point of Coonts even introducing us to these guys?  It's almost as if Coonts wanted to try his hand at the sort of novel that \\"Intruder\\" had saved us from - a soulless technothriller that offers no hint of the challenges of fighting with the high-tech weaponry of today.	2005-07-15

Earth has been destroyed after colliding with a wayward star which, luckily enough brought another planet along for the interstellar ride.  A raw deal for Earth turns into a major jackpot for a few human survivors - the new planet settles into orbit perfectly.  At this point, the novel could present its characters with the challenge of making a life on the new world for themselves.  Unfortunately, this slim novel has little time for characters who rise to the occasion.  Instead, \\"After\\" has our characters (already on a lucky-streak) discover a huge city left behind by the planet's original inhabitants.  Apparently not that far removed from the human newcomers, the original natives did not survive the interstellar trip, but left their cities in perfect shape for the human refugees - right down to stocks of apparently edible food.  In a more enlightened time, \\"After\\" would have had our characters discover that even a peachy-life in a new world has its downsides - as the Vikings discovered when they starved to death despite finding paradise in Greenland.<br /><br />Rather than learn the natural limits of their new world, \\"After\\" turns dated and moralistic - pitting the good survivors against another group, the bad survivors who escaped on a rocket built by hardcore Stalinists.  These enemies commandeer the largest of the alien cities, and choke off power to the smaller ones (meaning the ones occupied by the \\"good humans\\").  Will good win out over bad?  I was more interested in whether the either of the two would wake up and realize that their war might threaten the planet.  Just how dated is this story?  The good survivors are led by a Moses figure who hints at the bad survivors in biblical terms - Midianites, he calls them.  The novel never hints at the possibility that the miraculous feat of planetary physics that brought the new world to our solar system may have been off - with the planet either flying into the sun, or taking a hostile orbit, or simply careening away into the void again, looking for another, less complicated species with which to selflessly bring its promise of a new life.net either flying into the sun, or taking a hostile orbit, or simply careening away into the void again, looking for another, less complicated species with which to selflessly bring its promise of a new life.	2005-07-10

The Foxbat is a big and ugly airplane, one that Western intel had already dismissed as less-than wonderful.  (Previous reports of the jet's technological formidability were shot down when the west got a close look at a MiG-25 flown by a defecting pilot to Japan.)  In \\"Foxbat\\", the west changes its mind again due to reports of a new variant.  With better electronics, and more high-powered engines, this Foxbat is primed to become the Soviets' primary platform for anti-satellite weaponry.  \\"Foxbat\\" tells of the efforts to recruit, then blackmail an elite fighter pilot into defecting with his wonder fighter.  The novel is an interesting piece of cold-war frisson - easily dated to the mid/late 1970's.  (There are no good guys; even the Americans are using people to get what they want - an observation made by a navy pilot who realizes that he's being sacrificed to help nab the Soviet fighter.)  The hero of the story is the feckless and luckless Foxbat pilot who's dragooned into defecting, and then must survive when the Yankees get cold feet and decide that they want the plan quashed.  The characters are pretty thin, and the writing style won't stick on you like Craig Thomas does.

US	49374774	RNWEGNBMN7SEZ	B0007DUG8G	359856065	The missile lords;: A novel	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Novel of the defense industry	The \\"Missile Lords\\" of the title are neither astronauts, scientists, military officers or the politicians who authorize who pay for military contracts - no, the kings of the title are the corporate execs of Western Aerospace, a fictitious California company created for the sole purpose of selling nuclear missiles to the US government.  In this case, the rocket is the \\"Monarch\\", a ninety-foot, liquid-fueled monster destined to usher in a new generation of ICBM's.  As a prototype is being readied for the all-important test-launch, WA's chief marketing exec quits - triggering a power grab by front-runners of dubious promise for the job.  The real front-runner is Elliot, but Elliot's lover hopes he'll leave the Monarch, and the rat-race of WA, behind.  Koepple, we get the idea, would have been a great choice years earlier - now he's got the burn-out the job would have entailed without ever attaining the job itself.  Garfield is an unlikable lout - I keep picturing Jack Warden's character from \\"12 Angry Men\\".  Then there's Henderson, the suave exec who seems to have a more direct line to the boss.   <br /> <br />All of this drama exists even as the company has yet to sell the government a single Monarch.  As the launch date approaches, the company must deal with intrigue within, as well as pressures from the outside - from a congressman biased against liquid-fueled missiles, from skeptical media, and by the trouble-prone missile itself - which tends to explode.  As the execs face their individual problems, they debate the travails of the company, and thus inform the dilemmas of military contractors in pursuing the almighty \\"defense dollar\\".  (In pushing for contracts, contractors must guard against alienating other customers - other branches of the services, all of whom get their money from the same source.  Some services seem to push for programs simply to nullify programs of competing services.  To sell the \\"Monarch\\", WA must argue against the feasibility of anti-missile defenses, but not so strenuously that they'll upset the Army, which wants funding for its ABM projects.  The dilemma exists even if WA isn't funding that army project.) <br /> <br />This was a disappointing book for many reasons - but maybe my hopes were too high.  Written in 1962, when the world was less jaded, \\"Lords\\" still misses a big piece of the story - the Monarch itself.  Despite the defense-industry talk, the story is generic - this is a story about selling a product, rather than the birth of a complex and menacing weapons-system.  We seldom get closer than the ad-execs charged with selling the Monarch to America, but the might and mind behind this advanced technology is absent.  Worse, we get hints of what an interesting story the Monarch would make, while even the dynamics of different rockets is barely glanced over.  There are obviously nuts and bolts behind every adventure, but \\"Lords\\" seems to concern itself with the least interesting aspect of the entire story.  (This is most telling in an extended sequence set in Washington, when a scientist is quizzed by congressmen about different missiles - it seems that there many different missiles because there are so many different missions; but a congressman deftly observes that the missions seem created to justify the missile, rather than the other way around; he then gets WA's chief scientist to extol the benefits of solid-fueled and hypergolic rockets - which WA doesn't make.)  By the end of the story, WA's execs slowly divorce themselves of their romance with the Monarch - realizing that the next-generation of ICBM seems to exist only for the Monarch to be its vanguard.  Why these supposedly educated men had to wait that long is only one of the questions you'll be left asking.  Even the idea of \\"Lords\\" as a character-driven story seems a stretch - who are the contenders?  Sutton's characterizations seem pretty shallow (you quickly guess who Sutton's top choice is), and their backgrounds are a total mystery.   <br /> <br />Still, defense industry devotees may find themselves engrossed in this novel, which is firmly dated in the 1960's (with its old-fashioned ideas of corporate-exec speak, and its loving references to such time-lost projects as Skybolt & the RS-70).  Perhaps the disappointment of \\"Lords\\" reflects a story that just couldn't be told, and may explain why nobody has attempted to improve on it.  For its faults, \\"Lords\\" is a fast read, one that keeps you guessing until the hot-pad launch that climaxes the story.	2005-06-29

With no way to repair their ship, and nothing on hand but time, Captain Kirk, Mr. Scott & Pavel Chekhov begin swapping stories.  The fatal mine is not only a relic of an older war, it's also a painful reminder of a notorious test administered to Starfleet cadets (and made famous in \\"Wrath of Khan\\") called \\"Kobayshi Maru\\".  (Cadets who take the test are given simulated command of a starship; in the test itself, they are called on to rescue a stricken cargo ship crippled by a gravitic mine, and marooned in hostile space.  In flying to the rescue, cadets find themselves ambushed by Klingon battlecruisers.  At the heart of the simulation is an algorithm that automatically stacks the odds towards the cadet's obliteration.)  Their chances of survival looking slim, Kirk, Scott & Chekhov begin to wonder if they are experiencing a very real-life version of the \\"Kobayashi Maru\\".  While the test itself is only a simulation, the bitter failure is not.   <br /> <br />The stories our heroes swap inform much about them - Kirk who doesn't like to lose, Chekhov who can't bear that he did lose, and Scotty who thinks that there's an engineering solution for everything.  Still, it's a bit shallow - we get three short stories rather than a single deeper (and more satisfying) one.  If this were an episode of one of the shows, it would fall into the \\"ship in a bottle\\" variety.  Meant to be a character-driven story, KM offers little about the characters that we didn't already know (Kirk will break the rules to win; Chekhov is serious; Scotty is very can-do about things.) Still, it's a solid TOS-era story that won't leave you hungry.  It's never slow or dull and once you've started, you can't quite put it down.	2005-06-28

(Luckily, Drury encapsulates the the action of the prior books in a preface to this one; he also includes a list of the main characters). By \\"one of the last\\" I mean that it is one of two alternate finales to the \\"Advise\\" saga. At the end of the last book (which I didn't catch), an assassin kills one of two front-runners for the oval office. The victim identity - and our nation's fate - is resolved in both this book and its companion \\"Promise of joy\\". In \\"Promise\\" the heroic Orrin Knox survives to save America (and the world) from wooden-headed liberals. In \\"Tyre\\" it's king liberal himself, Ted Jason, who survives and ruins the country on becoming the president. Jason's platform is that of \\"peace\\" (which means dismantling the nation's status as a global superpower and its policy of confrontation with the Soviets). No Stalinist booster, Jason is nevertheless an outright stooge of the hardcore Soviets - convinced that their wish for peace reciprocates his own. But those familiar with Alan Drury know that this path invites disaster. In every global arena, a backward step by Americans is matched by an aggressive Soviet leap forward. Yankees pulling out of Africa are routed by a Soviet army; US advisers are rounded up and sent to camps in the Ukraine; American ships are sunk by Russian warships disguised as trawlers; Alaska is briefly occupied. In every case, the Jason administration faithfully clings to its sincere belief that all Soviets are good people just surrounded by nasty advisers - and that its more important to deal with opposition at home than commit warfare everywhere else. In every instance, Jason's refusal to resort to war (as well as every episode of the Soviets' refusal to resort to anything else) is championed by the craven, unelected plutocracy that is the American media, and enforced by leather-jacketed thugs.  <br /> <br/>Believe it or not, I've been called a right-wing stooge in my time, and not without reason. But I just couldn't buy Drury's fable. His perspective on both the Soviets and their willing accomplices (the media and ambitious, amoral politicians) alternates between arch sarcasm and overt antipathy, without the slightest nuance. The evil of liberal politicians - embodied by the Fred Ackerman and JB Swarthmore - seems most pronounced because their lack of depth: they'll do anything for political gain. The media (mostly named only according to their publications - a persistent Drury quirk) seems to have been driven insane with a new-found power to make Americans believe utter nonsense (the Russians are our friends - we're just a pack of evil imperialists who've long had it coming). The Russians themselves don't so much as speak as swagger in mindless triumph, careful to place the credit where it belongs (for their evil, the Soviets are little more than a force of natural evil; the real blame always lays firmly with domestic liberals and the media). Having taken pains to demonize the Yankee-left, the Russians themselves appear neglected, and their dialog wouldn't be enough for the villains of a second-rate Bond parody.  <br /> <br />Strangely, Drury's politics have nothing to do with the novels' problems because politics has nothing to do with the story. Drury's anti-Soviet plot make the case clear enough to elude debate, and only willfull blindness to Russian aggression allows it to survive. Otherwise, the combatants themselves are interchangeable - nothing about them defines them as left or right, conservative or liberal, GOP or DNC. In 2001, it would take little re-writing to make \\"Come Nineveh\\" an indictment of the right - replace the Soviets with OPEC, the media with big business, America's dominance in military power with its economic power, and just swap left-for-right.  <br /> <br />There's so much hot-air prose here about liberals and conservatives that it's easyto forget that the book never really identifies either of the two. Rather, the story relies on our bringing our own prejudices to the story - which Drury highlights in a foreword in which he warns readers that his prose won't sit well with those \\"who set the trends\\". The problem is that, when you put politics aside, \\"Come Nineveh\\" is worse than polemic - it's boring. The liberal media, and Yankee-bashing foreigners traverse the novel like a Greek chorus, courteously orating what's on everybody's mind. The \\"action\\" falls into a familiar pattern - Jason makes unwise overtures, the Soviets exploit them, the media reports dramatic American reversals at the hands of the Soviets, then somehow save Jason's leftist administration from the repercussions of his ruinous policies - for hundreds of pages. By the end of story, you're almost praying the Soviets will win, if only put the entire exercise to rest. The only shock Drury leaves is this: for all of its tortuous history and dialog, this is essentially a Seinfeld version of the political novel, the potboiler about nothing.	2005-06-27

If you've read any of the books in the \\"Advise and Consent\\" series, then nothing will surprise you here - least of all the fact that the book, which bills itself \\"a novel of space and politics\\", has next-to nothing to do with the exploration of space, but is really about the politics and dirty tricks of Drury's perennial enemies - the media and America's left.  <br /> <br />Set in the near future, when man has already landed on the moon, NASA plans an even greater leap to Mars. The stage is set for a spectacular showcase of technology and man surviving at its leading edge. Instead, Drury serves up a bland morality play in which intellectuals, liberal politicians, organized labor and the media (the triumvirate of the radical left) tries to co-opt the mission to serve their own liberal agenda. Whether its the racial makeup of the crew or cooperation with the Russians (who never cooperate despite the left's insistence to the contrary), nothing NASA does is right for the book's liberal villains. Drury's heroes are meant to be astronauts but they spend less time in space than on the ground where they are victimized by the left for their patriotism and their staunch opposition to the left. Drury has a reputation for hitting hard at liberals, but \\"Throne\\" illustrates less of an attack on liberal principles than dependency on the anti-leftist antipathy of his readers. Drury doesn't so much hit on liberals as remind his readers that he simply doesn't like them. As in other books, Drury has his media fixtures embodied by the chiefs of various newspapers, but they are named only according to their publications; among other villains are a few real-life lefties are described without names, but in ways that leave no doubt as to their identity (Dr. Spock puts in an appearance as the casualty of a botched sabotage-riot on the day of the Mars launch). Stuck to create a real villain, Drury gives us two wayward souls: a columnist dubbed \\"Percy have Mercy\\" who finds himself with the power to direct the national will for or against the mission; and the mission's sole African American - a black astronaut who nurses a monster chip on his shoulder, and is convinced above all of his victim hood.  <br /> <br />\\"Throne\\", written during the Vietnam war, mirrors the national chaos of the 1960's, but manages not to explain why the liberals were so fired up. (In contrast, though not entirely approving, Apollo era-Leftists were somewhat muted despite the fact that Vietnam made it fashionable to distrust any splashy government program). Drury's liberals aren't so much unprincipled as they are simply scheming, cowardly and dishonest. No liberal aims or principles exist in Drury's universe. As in \\"Come Nineveh\\", the left exists merely to emasculate America and tear it down, rather than compliment the right and balance its flaws. Though Drury may be convinced that he pounds mercilessly on his liberals, he misses liberalism entirely in \\"Throne\\". Percy, who is introduced early on, doesn't seem liberal at all - coming off as a somewhat effete Walter Winchell type. There was also a quirk in the way he speaks in which he repeated his dialog (\\"I do\\", he said \\"Indeed I do\\") though it's clear that everybody in the book speaks like him. Everybody but the Russians, who don't so much as say dialog as much as sneer it.  <br /> <br />The biggest insult is how close to Earth \\"Throne\\" remains. Though Drury posits his conservatives as principled humans who only want to further human exploration, Drury himself is eager to escape the confines of Earth and its complicated disputes as his liberals are. It's no surprise that Mars remains out of reach of Drury's Earthbound prose. With no liberal-elite-dominated media to mess things up on that distant planet, just what would these astronauts do when they got to Mars? Indeed, what would they do?	2005-06-27

It's fast and is very much a CT novel while also showing signs that the author was tiring of the form that he mastered.<br /><br />\\"Playing\\", set in modern India, centers on Patrick Hyde, former SAS commando and hero of previous Thomas novels.  (\\"Playing\\" features recurring CT characters, but CT's deft writing keeps you from getting lost, even if you've never read one of his older books.)  Having already retired from SAS and from being a behind-the-lines man for MI6, Hyde prepares to leave England for \\"Oz\\" with his portly and middle-aged lover, Ros.  Unfortunately for them both, Hyde is asked to take one last mission - investigate the situation of Phillip Cass, an MI6 agent in India.  Last seen as a small character in \\"Last Raven\\", Cass is now under scrutiny of both New Delhi and London when he's implicated in the brutal murder of the Indian PM's beautiful wife.  There's no doubt that Cass had been intimate with the beautiful Serena Sharmar, but he denies the murder.  Instead, Serena was murdered (and Cass framed) by her husband VK Sharmar and his conniving brother Prakhesh to cover the Sharmars' role as a master heroin trafficker.  Hyde is quickly convinced of Cass's innocence - but he's alone in that respect.  Serena was worshipped across India - married to a liberal politician, frequent co-star of action movie heroes who appeal to Hindi nationalism.  Worse, even the British are unwilling to consider Cass's story - because it would antagonize Sharmar's allies in India's progressive Congress party - consequently weakening its anti-nationalist goals (disengagement from Kashmir; peace with Pakistan) and handing India over to the rabidly nationalistic and anti-secular BJP party. (That's my take from the novel - \\"The Rotten Review\\" professes no reasonable perspective on Indo-Pak politics.)  When the Sharmars kidnap Cass from prison, because it would be easier for everybody if he just disappears, Hyde springs into action - jumping over the heads of fellow Brits and the Indians at the same time.  Thomas brings the action to a climax with one of his trademark massive-manhunts, using the lushness of India, the remoteness of Pakistan and the glacial hell of the Afghan border to utterly consume his characters.  Few if any writers have captured as sublimely the tension of being at the center of a huge, cross-border manhunt as Craig Thomas has.  It's \\"Firefox\\" on the ground - and it works as unlikely as it sounds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Playing\\" gets too little of the Craig Thomas formula - going on too long before the big-hunt part of the book even kicks off.  Until then it's a story about crooked Indian politicians - one whose conspiracies haven't aroused much interest among the British.  Much of the story seems forced - Hyde's believing Cass, suspicion falling on the Sharmars, London getting ready to toss Cass to the wolves - without substance justifying it.  We know the Sharmar's are bad...because the book tells us so (and not as is traditional in CT novels, because characters have enough depth to learn it themselves).  The story seems rushed - more like \\"A Different War\\" than \\"Snow Falcon\\" or the other Mitchell Gant books.  It rewards CT fans, but is not a great book for first time CT readers.	2005-06-26

In \\"Sphere\\", a team of brilliant scientists are taken to a deep sea lab, miles below the waves, to investigate a mysterious object that turns out to be a spacecraft. Rather than extraterrestrial, the ship appears to be the product of an advanced human civilization of the future (and the grave of several of those futuristic humans).  How the craft came to bend the rules of time is only one tidbit left to the debate of the scientists.  The team hasn't enough time to decode the mystery of the spacecraft before they find an even deeper mystery in its hold - a large spherical object clearly of non-human origin. Its purpose unknown, but possibly holding the essence of the intelligence that created it, the sphere soon makes its presence felt far beyond the spaceship. Returning to their lab, but unable to return to the surface immediately, the team finds the lab surrounded by mysterious mutations of undersea life. A larger, though invisible creature makes appearances on the sonar screens. Then the team begins receiving messages from an unknown entity...called Harry. Friendly at first, Harry becomes cranky, then malicious.  <br /> <br />This was actually a great book. Though it's not entirely original (trap a bunch of eggheads in some remote place where they've got to fill each other's heads with technobabble and psychogibberish) for a Crichton novel, there are variations on his general theme - a strong central character, and a supporting cast. Rather than try and get these guys to work with each other, we soon suspect that at least one of them is working with the sphere. The mystery of the sphere itself remains suitably mysterious and, by necessity, we are spared the indignity of having some character solve the mystery for us simply by telling us what it all means. I'm no fan of Crichton's writing, but I enjoyed \\"Sphere\\".	2005-06-16
US	49374774	RTEBI4UEE43HY	0060094117	11422607	Plan of Attack: A Novel (Brown, Dale)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Good, not Great Dale Brown	\\"Plan of Attack\\" hints at being the last of Dale Brown's mil/aviation techno-thrillers.  (A coming book hints a new franchise; like Coonts, Brown seems ready to jettison the genre of military aviation fiction for something closer to earth.)  The war here is much closer to home.  Iran, Korea and China?  Nowhere near the fray.  \\"Plan\\" is a direct sequel to Brown's last book - which I missed - in which hero Pat Mclanahan, roasted a large chunk of Russia's strategic bomber fleet.  Russian leader Anatolyi Gryzlov is a former bomber-driver, and seems eager for revenge.   <br /> <br />The story starts with Americans and Russians in an uneasy ceasefire.  Mclanahan heads \\"Air Battle Force\\", an elite USAF unit using next generation hardware - including \\"Tin Man\\" commandos and remote-piloted aircraft.  When Mclanahn attacks a Russian SAM task force he suspects of planning to violate the fragile ceasefire, he's demoted and exiled from ABF, and consigned to a ground position in intel.  Worst of all, his new boss is actually his old boss: General Houser - the B-52 pilot last seen giving Mclanahan orders in the first chapter of \\"Flight of the Old Dog\\" 18 years ago.  Houser, a professional pilot in \\"Dog\\" seamlessly transitioned to flying desks, and will become the latest in a long line of USAF staff-weenies determined to cure Mclanahan of his maverick streak and make him a team player. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the Russians revamp their bomber fleet with new weapons and logistics.  Though signs of a major Russian strike are everywhere, only Mclanahan is capable of explicitly interpreting them as pointing to a major attack.  When Mclanahan circumvents USAF protocol, with its devotion to channels of authority, he's stripped even further by his capricious superiors - certain that Mclanahan has become another loose-cannon like his mentor, the late Brad Elliot.  Even after the Russians do strike, vindicating Mclanahan, his bosses still want to cream him.  It's only by force of will that Mclanahan re-claims control of the ABF, \\"surges\\" with enough aircraft to neutralize the Russian threat and manages to save the day. <br /> <br />This was a very good - though not quite great novel.  On the one hand, there is a compelling threat.  Also, the danger here isn't some exotic new technology, but a more conventional kind, as our heroes scramble to locate every ICBM unit capable of threatening America.  There's a compelling villain here as well - with Gryzlov as a former pilot who may have Mclanahan's smarts and seems most capable of checking him.  We even have some good shots of Russian bomber crews at work.  There's even an honest-to-god surprise ending. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, while still a good read, Brown fans will find much of the stuff that makes it hard to enjoy one of his books.  The story junks Russian aircrews who looked more interesting than their American counterparts - having them easily fall victim to Yankee hi-tech.  American high-tech magically annihilates the opposition.  It's hard to tell if the Russians fail because they aren't following Gryzlov's advice for countering ABF's stealth aircraft, or if they're just doing it badly.  The story never stays in one place long enough or with one character or character set long enough to make anybody interesting.  Gryzlov seems to have enough know-how to obviate his being the latest in a long-line of psychotic villains in Brown novels - but he's miscast as the Russian President.  (Wouldn't a guy who knows so much about warplanes have been a better choice to actually lead them?  Here, he's stuck advising his generals about how to destroy the ABF rather than taking charge himself.)  Thorn, Brown's whippy-dippy President, also goes out badly.  In previous novels, he was interesting and more importantly, decisive.  Best of all, he was perhaps the only Brown only character who was neither a hero, villain, bureaucratic or political opportunist or simply raving lunatic.  Here he's just petulant.  As forthe technology, the book's selling point - as in Brown's latter books, it's a bit too high-tech, with pilotless bombers, insertion aircraft and drones behaving way too smoothly.  Brown never attempts the otherwise impossible challenge of human drama when there's no humans involved - he just describes what's going on matter-of fact.  Brown has seldom brought much humanity to the flightdecks of his warplanes - and only cements that fact by enhancing the use of human-less warplanes.  Also, the concentration of all that high-tech to a single unit makes you wonder why some of it hasn't made its way to regular line units.  There are man-portable rail-guns capable of knocking down cruise missiles and high-performance aircraft - but there are no fixed rail-gun sites replacing Patriot missiles, and F-16 fighters are still stuck with a handful of sidewinders and their guns.  StealthHawk drones can only be carried, launched, refueled and reclaimed by special, purpose-built ABF aircraft - but no expendable versions that can be launched by existing planes or ships.  Lastly, Brown never constructs believable characters, even though so much of \\"Plan\\" is character driven.  The USAF brass that sneers at Mclanahan's initiative seems capriciously anal - military versions of the police brass seen in countless and dated cop shows.  Never mind that Mclanahan correctly predicts every Russian move, his compulsively bureaucratic superiors will not abide an officer who's not a team player - even though hounding \\"Muck\\" will force his superiors to publicize how they goofed.  Never mind how much of \\"Plan\\" boils down to the war between \\"Muck\\" and his annoying supervisors - making the officers of \\"Plan\\" the least convincing of their kind to be found outside a Pat Robinson novel.  Much of the story is burdened by Brown's trademark leaden style - full names, titles and responsibilities for characters repeated during the story; full operational dossiers of characters, regardless of lack of relevances; full run-down on inventories of weapons and technology, even when not relevant - all interrupting the action.  To its credit, \\"Plan\\" has fewer than normal references to Brown's earlier books. <br /> <br />In short - a great Brown novel, but still a Brown novel.	2005-06-05

He is also emotionally crippled by a loveless childhood, a career spent in the shadow of his boss, Ray Horgan and a marriage all but mortally wounded by Sabich's fling with another prosecutor.  When Carolyn Polhemus, Sabich's lover is found brutally murdered, he's assigned to find the killer.  Polhemus, we learn, was an ambitious prosecutor who uses and discards men. Carolyn's brutal murder, coming critical days before Ray Horgan's latest re-election campaign, electrifies Kindle county. For Sabich, the problems are deeper. His affair with Carolyn already brought to a painful end, Sabich's assignment to crack the case only raises more cruel memories. But, when clues begin pointing directly at Sabich, his problems are just beginning and Sabich faces the prosecutor's other nightmare - to become the target of the very same apparatus that he has long mastered. Forced to rely on a formidible professional rival - the courtly Alejandro \\"Sandy\\" Stern - and now facing as bitter enemies his ex-colleagues, Sabich's life is turned upside-down.  <br />\\"Presumed Innocent\\" is actually several novels - Sabich's trial being only one. Rather than rely on inelegant prose, Turow also crafts a nuanced study of Sabich's character, creating a hollow adult capable of prosecuting cases of unspeakable crimes yet brought to the edge of ruin by the callous disregard of a cruel woman. But most of all, \\"Innocent\\" is also the story of Kindle County, of crooked and vindictive cops and judges, of the \\"Night Saints\\", of litigating attorneys who use the courts to boost their prestige, of the hacks, the ambitious, the overzealous and the cruel. In delicate prose, Turow lays out his story and his rogue's gallery of characters, but manages almost neverto become judgmental. Even Ray Horgan's betrayal of Sabich seems a perfectly human response to perceived betrayals by Rusty. In the end, there doesn't seem to be a character that hasn't faced some kind of prosecution between the lines.  \\"Presumed Innocent\\" may be one of the most re-readable novels of the past 20 years.	2005-05-22
US	49374774	R2PLYL3MYP6FKK	044022165X	511419057	The Rainmaker	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Great Grisham	Because I was in law school when I read it, I immediately identified with the hero of this Grisham novel. Rudy Baylor, the hero, isn't the top-notch student of some top-tier school, and the mysterious or openly corrupt southern firms aren't about to bang down his door. Even the mid-level prospects that Baylor had counted on for needed employment after graduation seem to vanish in the wind. But he's determined and not just a little ambitious, and his very first case takes him up against an evil HMO represented by the top law firm in state, a self-contained old-boy network with time and money to burn, and half the state's judges in its pocket.  <br /> <br />But Rainmaker is more than that. Actually, it's a bundle of stories sharing Rudy Baylor as the common denominator. He finds love with a battered wife, room and board with a widow who may be worth millions, learns things about law they don't teach you in law school and mixes with a rogue's gallery of unsavory types who are in equal measures scary and indispensable. Baylor's best hope (for work) is the ambulance chasing king of the hill, served by an army of disbarred or never-licensed minions who can't litigate issues.  <br /> <br />The book is best in the first half when it's not clear which of these little stories - if any - will take over the book. When Baylor's lawsuit against the evil HMO's takes over, the story necessarily slows down and becomes less satisfying. The trial itself becomes a bit of a disappointment - the racist old-time judges suddenly keels over to be replaced with one more friendly to Rudy and his cause and openly averse to the defense; the defense attorneys themselves remain the perfect paradigms of their evil breed and the defendants...well, what would you say in the defense of an HMO?  <br /> <br />As if to balance, Grisham beefs up the other plots (now firmly subplots) with unconvincing melodrama - a violent confrontation with the battered wife's evil husband being the worst example. Through it all however, he remains Rudy Baylor, first year law grad, scared out of his mind and possibly the Grisham's best hero.	2005-05-22
US	49374774	R37LG2OK4ITHPN	0312965613	413159447	Tomahawk: A Dan Lenson Novel (Dan Lenson Novels)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Flawed but still a worthwhile read.	The \\"Rotten Review\\" has a tough time with this one, the latest (but not last) of Poyer's \\"Dan Lenson\\" novels.  Rather than an outright op., I'll go with what I saw and hope that gives readers an informed choice. <br /> <br />FOR THOSE WHO KNOW NO LENSON: I'd recommend against meeting him here.  For its plusses, \\"Tomahawk\\" will never be considered a good starting point (oops - I eant, \\"point of ingress\\") for anybody.  Instead, pick up \\"The Passage\\" or \\"The Circle\\".  That said, Lenson is the unluckiest officer in USN history.  Not especially genius, he's motivated (the reviewer who called him a doofus wasn't that far off).  But {Poyer gave us enough to make him sympathetic - we had to follow the story because it was always about him (most of the time).  None of the Lenson novels are contemporary - though written in recent times, they are set in the past along a linear line beginning with the post Vietnam war era.  The Lenson novels are also a sort of blue-collar approach to the naval-novel - fixated on the flaws of characters rather than their hardware (though Lenson does provide plenty of the hardware as well).  Chapters don't begin with block-letter blurbs of date, location and time in military/zulu hours, and pages aren't redolent with countless forgettable military acronyms.  There's a lot of military arcane, but the stuff you need to know seeps in, while I think Poyer provides even the most unschooled with hints on what to ignore. <br /> <br />THE PLOT: \\"Tomahawk\\" occurs after the events of \\"The Passage\\".  It's the mid -80's, as the Navy is gearing up to meet The Reagan administration's goal of a 600-ship navy, and the new generation of sophisticated weapons that will arm it.  One of these new weapons is the Tomahawk, a low-flying cruse-missile capable of carrying nuclear weapons deep into hostile skies.  Now a fixture of pour arsenal, in the mid-1980's, the weapon is untested, over-budget and apparently doomed to failure.   Though cruise missiles were invented in WWII, as Lenson learns, the technology to make them worthwhile remains in a snag a generation later.  Fresh from sea-duty, and at a cross-roads in his life, Lenson takes to his new high-stakes job with less than high enthusiasm.  Romance with an anti-nuclear activist, and a less-than pretty look at the dark-side of military-industrial complex arouse his doubts about the program, and his own future as a naval officer.  Poyer tosses in inter-service rivalry, Libyan rumblings and espionage into the mix. <br /> <br />Like I said this was not the Lenson novel to begin the series with.  It's much too long, there's probably too much introspection (a lot of it religious, but much of it questioning our development of nuclear and nuclear capable weapons) and much other non-nautical stuff going on before Lenson oets to sea again.  Also, there are more characters around then Poyer can deal with, and none of them rises high enough to define Lenson by reflection. <br /> <br />That said, Poyer is to be commended for giving \\"Tomahawk\\" a try.  The focus never leaves Lenson - whose actions seemed plausible in light of his confused and unstable state of mind.  Whether or not the novel evinces a left-ward slant on Poyer's part, the prose make it clear that Lenson has reason to feel his way - very much the anti Patrick Robinson novel.  The nautical scenes are few and far between, but enjoyable and well worth the wait.  This was an overlong novel whose biggest flaw isd that it takes bigger risks than most other naval-technothrillers.	2005-05-15

Direct combat with U-Boats - which are about as fast underwater as a man on a bicycle - only leads to greater losses. Coordinated by the German navy using a seemingly impenetrable military code, the U-Boats are on the verge of starving England into submission and crippling the war effort on every front.  <br /> <br />While England survives on a diet of moldy bread and jam (and whale meat), and British women concoct cosmetics out of odds and ends, teams of theoretical mathematicians struggle feverishly to decode every German transmission. Cloistered at a remote estate outside of London, and using captured enigma code breaking machines, early computers and every secret they can muster, the cryptographers assault the code and incidentally invent artificial intelligence.  In \\"Enigma\\", Harris takes the true story of the \\"Bletchley\\" Codebreakers and tosses in murder and espionage. <br /> <br />For Harris' hero, Tom Jericho, the strain of breaking codes proved too great, triggering a nervous breakdown and an early retirement. Unfortunately, and forewarned by British decryption, a huge convoy of desperately needed supplies has been targeted by a massive wolfpack of U-boats.  As the convoy steams toward waters teeming with submarine hunters, the German's completely revamp their codes. Now blind and soon to be crippled, the British have no choice but to summon Jericho back to the project.  <br /> <br />Returning, but soon wearing out his welcome, Jericho finds that the U-boats are not the only threat. Trying to reunite with a fellow cryptographer with whom he'd fallen in love, Jericho uncovers signs of espionage within the cryptographer's cloistered headquarters in Bletchley Park. When Jericho's lover goes missing, and with the allied convoy heading for certain disaster, Jericho turns sleuth. It's a painful and unwanted role, but Harriss manuevers his reluctant hero imaginatively, brilliantly turning Jericho's investigation into a deadly exercize in decoding the deepest, darkest code-making machine ever devised: the human heart.	2005-05-09
US	49374774	RQUS7GGC46BY1	0553296124	81931578	Heir to the Empire (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 1)	Books	2	5	10	N	N	SW: The Next Generation (not a good thing!)	This talky and not very dynamic SW novel is very much to SW what \\"The Next Generation\\" was to the Trek franchise.  It hits all the core ideas of the franchise, but doesn't really expand on them, making sure it goes exactly where we've gone before.   <br /> <br />\\"Heir\\" picks up the SW saga 5 years after the Rebellion's triumph at Endor. By \\"now\\" the dread imperial star fleet has been reduced to shreds commanded by a loose array of brooding admirals and imperial generals who, for the reverence they exact from their troops, are little more than potentates of discord. The rebellion, now a new republic, contends not only with the remnants of the empire but the anarchy left by its collapse. (Remember, the Empire didn't rely on unity to enhance its rule - preferring to split the galaxy into military districts and using firepower to subdue everybody else.) While the new republic tries to create order, Luke leaves on a search for a lost jedi knight. Han and Leia are separated as Leia finds herself pursued by mysterious bounty hunters. Lando Calrissian finds the maneuverings of the imperial fleet getting in the way of one his latest schemes. Meanwhile, Admiral Thrawn, late of the Imperial fleet, maneuvers his ragtag collection of worn-out star destroyers in harassing raids against the fringes of the republic. Though he's fighting a losing battle, he has other plans, all centered around a lost jedi. Is this the beginning of a new saga?  <br /> <br />As if.  <br /> <br />In every way, this over-sized potboiler saps the saga everything that made it fun. While the original scripts relied on techno-babble as a necessary evil - Zahn uses it as main dialog. Worse, unlike each of the films, which were necessarily connected but also complete by themselves, \\"Heir\\" is obviously the incomplete episode of a larger series. That Zahn couldn't write a singular plot (whether to be connected to sequels or not) says less about the complexity of the story than Zahn's derivative, meandering plot. Thrawn (who appears in the PC game \\"Tie Fighter\\" of 1994) plans some moves, but keeps strategy to himself; Luke searches for some last Jedi, but the implications are pretty vague; A mysterious and sinister Jedi may be a clone of another mysterious and dark jedi; Lando has his business pursuits; and so on. Instead of bringing these threads together, Zahn adds more, and never seems to know where he's going. Instead of climaxes that tie the disparate threads together (as in the movies) we have orbiting story arcs that merge together. It's almost as if the points of the plot had nothing better to do than prolong the book and ensure sequels.  Narrative aside, Zahn's plot doesn't quite stand the test of time, and its unoriginal plot ideas (clones, dark jedis, interplanetary gangsters who play both sides and the ever-present threat that the empire will resurrect itself) wasn't quite the epic when it first appeared. Nothing here communicates the drama, irony or velocity of the movies, and some ideas like plants that feed on force power, seem more like contrived ideas created for a video game than substantive plot elements (Lucas took a big hit for suggesting \\"Midi Chloridians\\", yet the idea of \\"force-sucking\\" ferns seems about as palatable). Without the kinetic style of the movies, \\"Heir\\" is like \\"Phantom Menace\\" without the special effects.	2005-05-02

Though it's an adventurous job, \\"War\\" set itself above other techno thrillers or mil-av novels by painfully depicting just how hard a job it really was to fly high-performance fighter jets from aircraft carriers.  The Tomcats of the Punk novels are incredible airplanes - but they're also trouble-prone, and are light-years away from the high-tech dream machines of the Dale Brown books.  More tellingly, the fliers who populate \\"Punk's War\\" and its sequels are nuanced, fallible and typically display more of a dramatic range than you'd expect from a single-page character dossier.  In \\"War\\", Reichert flew Tomcats in the Iraqi skies between the two Gulf wars.  In \\"Fight\\", Reichert will endure combat on the ground after he's forced to bail-out over Afghanistan in the wake of the 9-11 attacks.   <br /> <br />In \\"Wing\\", Reichert has a more sedate job - a summer job as an F-14 instructor working on the shore.  Though it's not as rigorous as sea-duty - with possible combat or the nightly horror of having to land on carriers in the dark - teaching raw cadets how to fly the F-14 proves to have its own hazards.  Most of those deal with \\"Muddy\\" Waters - a woman whose advancement as a Tomcat driver has attracted politicians and politically minded naval officers.  But Punk also has to contend with a mysterious problem plaguing F-14's - one that proves tragic in one case.  Punk also has to deal with slippery defense contractors out to pin the F-14 problems on pilot error.  But the biggest problem turns out to be a matter of timing: the blissful summer, we learn, is actually the summer of 2001.  By the end of the novel, Punk will have left behind his cozy shore-side billetfor the no-margin-for-error battlefront, and will have to rely on help from his untried trainees. <br /> <br />From cover to cover, \\"Punk's Wing\\" proves the best of the series, and perhaps one the best military aviation novels ever written.  The characters are full-bodied, but author Carroll wisely restricts the novel's POV to Punk Reichert himself.  Though the novel is chock full of the sort of highly arcane and technical details you'd normally find in a technothriller, Carroll uses them to drive his story demonstrate varying degrees of expertise among his aviators, unlike other authors who use excessive and typically irrelevant technical detail to cover up threadbare writing skills, characters and plots, and otherwise create a sense of realism that really isn't there.  (Carroll gets some good shots at technothriller writers when he skewers the researcher for one in the aftermath of the WTC attacks.)  Carroll also covers much ground - from basic airmanship in the F-14 to the horrors of night flying to the rigors of long-distance flight.  Every military aviation author claims to make his readers feel like they're at the controls - but Punk delivers the goods.	2005-05-02
US	49374774	R23JB0JGSKENE9	0385043929	237267567	Come Nineveh, Come Tyre: The Presidency of Edward M. Jason	Books	2	11	17	N	N	overlong polemic...about nothing	\\"Come Nineveh, Come Tyre\\", is one of the last entries of a prolonged political saga that Alan Drury began with \\"Advise and Consent\\". (Luckily, Drury encapsulates the the action of the prior books in a preface to this one; he also includes a list of the main characters).  By \\"one of the last\\" I mean that it is one of two alternate finales to the \\"Advise\\" saga.  At the end of the last book (which I didn't catch), an assassin kills one of two front-runners for the oval office.  The victim identity - and our nation's fate - is resolved in both this book and its companion \\"Promise of joy\\".  In \\"Promise\\" the heroic Orrin Knox survives to save America (and the world) from wooden-headed liberals.  In \\"Tyre\\" it's king liberal himself, Ted Jason, who survives and ruins the country on becoming the president.  Jason's platform is that of \\"peace\\" (which means dismantling the nation's status as a global superpower and its policy of confrontation with the Soviets). No Stalinist booster, Jason is nevertheless an outright stooge of the hardcore Soviets - convinced that their wish for peace reciprocates his own. But those familiar with Alan Drury know that this path invites disaster. In every global arena, a backward step by Americans is matched by an aggressive Soviet leap forward. Yankees pulling out of Africa are routed by a Soviet army; US advisers are rounded up and sent to camps in the Ukraine; American ships are sunk by Russian warships disguised as trawlers; Alaska is briefly occupied. In every case, the Jason administration faithfully clings to its sincere belief that all Soviets are good people just surrounded by nasty advisers - and that its more important to deal with opposition at home than commit warfare everywhere else. In every instance, Jason's refusal to resort to war (as well as every episode of the Soviets' refusal to resort to anything else) is championed by the craven, unelected plutocracy that is the American media, and enforced by leather-jacketed thugs.  <br/> <br />Believe it or not, I've been called a right-wing stooge in my time, and not without reason. But I just couldn't buy Drury's fable. His perspective on both the Soviets and their willing accomplices (the media and ambitious, amoral politicians) alternates between arch sarcasm and overt antipathy, without the slightest nuance. The evil of liberal politicians - embodied by the Fred Ackerman and JB Swarthmore - seems most pronounced because their lack of depth: they'll do anything for political gain. The media (mostly named only according to their publications - a persistent Drury quirk) seems to have been driven insane with a new-found power to make Americans believe utter nonsense (the Russians are our friends - we're just a pack of evil imperialists who've long had it coming). The Russians themselves don't so much as speak as swagger in mindless triumph, careful to place the credit where it belongs (for their evil, the Soviets are little more than a force of natural evil; the real blame always lays firmly with domestic liberals and the media). Having taken pains to demonize the Yankee-left, the Russians themselves appear neglected, and their dialog wouldn't be enough for the villains of a second-rate Bond parody.  <br /> <br />Strangely, Drury's politics have nothing to do with the novels' problems because politics has nothing to do with the story. Drury's anti-Soviet plot make the case clear enough to elude debate, and only willfull blindness to Russian aggression allows it to survive. Otherwise, the combatants themselves are interchangeable - nothing about them defines them as left or right, conservative or liberal, GOP or DNC.  In 2001, it would take little re-writing to make \\"Come Nineveh\\" an indictment of the right - replace the Soviets with OPEC, the media with big business, America's dominance in military power with its economic power, and just swap left-for-right.   <br /> <br />There's so much hot-air prose here about liberals and conservatives thatit's easy to forget that the book never really identifies either of the two. Rather, the story relies on our bringing our own prejudices to the story - which Drury highlights in a foreword in which he warns readers that his prose won't sit well with those \\"who set the trends\\".  The problem is that, when you put politics aside, \\"Come Nineveh\\" is worse than polemic - it's boring.  The liberal media, and Yankee-bashing foreigners traverse the novel like a Greek chorus, courteously orating what's on everybody's mind.  The \\"action\\" falls into a familiar pattern - Jason makes unwise overtures, the Soviets exploit them, the media reports dramatic American reversals at the hands of the Soviets, then somehow save Jason's leftist administration from the repercussions of his ruinous policies - for hundreds of pages.  By the end of story, you're almost praying the Soviets will win, if only put the entire exercise to rest.  The only shock Drury leaves is this: for all of its tortuous history and dialog, this is essentially a Seinfeld version of the political novel, the potboiler about nothing.	2005-04-19

In \\"Venus\\", set in the near future, a ruthless tycoon offers an even $10 billion (what will that buy by then?) to the first person who can retrieve the remains of his eldest son from the ruthless surface of never-colonized Venus. Martin Humphries's first son died while trying to land on Venus years ago. His surviving son, Van, is a whiny, spoiled brat who suffers from a rare and incurable anemia. In a stroke of genius, Bova makes Van (as unsympathetic a character as you can get) the hero. Van is no fearless strapping pioneer - he explores planets using VR goggles - but his love for his dead brother draws him to Venus. (Van also needs the prize money, since Humphries has cut off Van's stipend to pay for it.)  Because of his love for his brother, and hatred of his father, winning the prize seems the best way to achieve two aims - all Van must do is reclaim his brother's remains...from the surface of a planet that approximates hell itself.   <br /> <br />Also vying for the prize is the mysterious Lars Fuchs. An old enemy of Humphries, Fuchs made his fortunes as a \\"rock rat\\", a sort of wildcat driller essentially exiled to the asteroid belt. The enmity between the two provides some of the mystery to the story. Though Humphries is the typical villain in the Bova mold (filthy rich and an anti-environmentalist tycoon - essentially evil incorporate), Fuchs is an enigmatic genius in the Verne mode - of dark moods, many secrets and an oversized ego.  Fuchs also has an ominous taste in naming his spaceships.  (Fuch's spaceship is named \\"Lucifer\\"; the descent module is named \\"Hecate\\" after the underworld goddess.)  Bova even tosses in a sort of love-interest in the beautiful Marguerite Duchamp.  When disaster strikes, and the two must throw their lot in with the enigmatic Fuchs, Bova becomes deliberately vague about what Duchamp must do to save herself and Humphries from their savior and captor. <br /> <br />The characters are compelling, but the real star is Venus, one of those worlds that seethes damnation. Closer to the sun, Venus is exposed to more heat than Earth, but can't vent it because of the clouds of sulfuric acid that enshroud it. Because there's no liquid water, Venus has no \\"fuel\\" for the geological movement needed to vent the planet's interior heat.  With volcanic pressure of Venus's core steadily building up without release, the planet is turning into a geological time-bomb. With its slower planetary rotation, Venus accepts the brunt of the sun's energy on one side, (the \\"subsolar\\"), generating huge storms called \\"super-rotations\\". Bova makes all of this clear to the reader, not simply because he uses Van as the narrator but makes Van something approachable to readers - a planetologist making the leap, not from one planet to another, but from a virtual version of one planet to another. Bova doesn't serve the heaping moralism of the Moonrise and Mars books (in which anything \\"corporate\\" is bad; also in which some fabulous new technology is assailed by fundamentalist religious types, and become available only to the very rich), though expensive technology firmly demarcates the line between haves and have-nots more forcefully than in those other books. Though Van's transformation to hero is a bit too pat, and there's little-enough sense of time or tension as to what he will find when his chance comes to land on Venus, \\"Venus\\" the story still excels in the climax.	2005-04-18

Hardly a cause for celebration among his enemies, Stalin's impending demise signals that he's on the verge of his most reckless adventure yet - WWIII.  Hoping to forestall the Soviets before they can perfect the H-bomb, the CIA dispatches their most elusive assassin to off Stalin for good.  With a beautiful woman at his side - a Russian who escaped the brutal Gulags, but left her daughter behind - the assassin eludes every dragnet the Soviets leave in his pathm but one.  Unfortunately, the mission of the assassin, codenamed \\"Snow Wolf\\" is compromised before it even touches Soviet-bloc soil.  Yet the Wolf feels confident he can reach his target.  Meanwhile, Jake Massey, the American spymaster who set the mission going, is ordered to kill it - and his agents if he has to.  With the details of the mission known to the Russians, the west is terrified that the soviets will use Stalin's murder as an excuse for war.<br /><br />This was a book I'd wanted to read for years, but the results are disappointing.  There's little to break away from the pack of McLean, Forsythe or Ludlum or their imitators.  The dialog and prose are flat, and the characters are cardboard caricatures - you learn little more about them than needed to set the good guys from bad (especially a KGB sadist named Romulka who'll pose problems for the Americans and Russians alike).  Those flaws aside, \\"Snow Wolf\\" is boring - it takes forever to get its act together, and by then, it's lost sight of what its about.  Nothing in the latter part of the book ratifies the fears of the former - that Stalin is on his last legs, and plans to go out with a thermo-nuclear bang; that the Russians are on the verge of starting WWIII; that the Soviet Union is a police state inhabited by loyal and ideology-enslaved communists ready to destroy the world).  The story hints at some secret held by Anna Khorev, the Wolf's companion - but then forgets about her and turns her into the standard damsel-in-distress.  Worse, losing sight of the ideas it started with, \\"Snow Wolf\\" doesn't create any new ones, or become any character's story.  It focuses on the Wolf's hunter, a KGB officer names Lukin who, unsurprisingly, turns out to be a too-decent guy to kill his prey.  There's a late plot twist revealed in the last few chapters, but it's been botched as well - the existence of the secret is revealed near the beginning, so you're already primed for it.  The revelation of the secret follows the rest of the novel's style of unnecessarily over-baked dialog, and the revelation itself just has you scratching your head.  That said, the plot holes aren't terribly huge, but do beg for your attention - though the story is told from the viewpoint of Anna Khoreva (no spoiler - she's introduced early on), much of the book occurs out of her presence.  Also, the idea that Soviets would blame the west seems pretty much out the window once they learn of the Wolf's mission.  Don't they have enough to blame the west already?  The novel posits a Soviet armed camp poised to strike at the rest of the world, but never hints of this once we actually get to Moscow.<br /><br />But worst of all, \\"Snow Wolf\\" just doesn't hold your attention.

(Dirk Pitt Adventure)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Another enjoyable & over-the-top Pitt actioner	They've come bigger, and badder and louder, but there's something about \\"Raise the Titanic\\" that sets it apart from the rest of the series of books starring ocean-going adventurer Dirk Pitt.  In this adventure, Pitt must track down a motherlode of a rare element called Byzanium.  Mined decades earlier from Russia, the ore is an essential component of a huge forcefield the United States hopes to use against Soviet missiles.  When the story starts, the surviving ill-fated \\"Coloradans\\" who mined the precious mineral are nearing home.  But as with every Pitt story, this one begins with an historic disaster.  In this case, the miners have snagged a berth on RMS Titanic for their last-leg home.  Fast forward to the other side of the century - Americans learning of the Byzanium waiting at the bottom of the Atlantic mount a huge effort to find and raise the Titanic.  Unfortunately, a wily Soviet spymaster learns of the Byzanium himself, and the race is on. <br /> <br />Much of \\"Titanic\\" is preposterous but fun in Cussler's great tradition of Pitt stories.  Will Pitt and his loyal friends at NUMA manage to pull off the greatest act of salvage in maritime history?  Will our heroes confront every last minute crisis with their typical aplomb?  Will the Soviets go down despite their ruthlessness?  Will every beautiful woman in the story throw themselves at Pitt?  Is the Atlantic wet?  \\"Titanic\\" manages to be shocking in its resolve to follow every rule of Dirk Pitt stories, while delivering the goods.  Completely preposterous and undeniably fun.	2005-03-29
US	49374774	R3UEUEGHJMIFBN	0425157164	41517145	Shadows of Steel	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Not so thrilling technothriller	In \\"Shadows of Steel\\", It's the \\"United States Air Force of Patrick McLanahan\\" v. Iran.  Having previously duked it out with Soviets, Red China and a KGB mole, maverick flier McLanahan is tagged to fly stealth missions into Iran.  The covert war is spurred by Iran's defacto nationalization of large pieces of the Persian Gulf and their acquisition of an ex-Russian aircraft carrier (betcha can't guess the name).  Obviously the Iranians will have none of McLanahan's airborne warfare, but they get help from some allies in America - liberals, bureaucrats and a pissed-off Navy Admiral who's around to remind us that inter-service rivalry is alive and well in the future of Brown's books. <br /> <br />This was a middling novel.  Like most of Brown's books, its hampered by its need to get the look, sound and feel of air combat.  Unfortunately, we get so much data, there's no room for the story, or even the idea that the book has a plot.  \\"Steel\\" never feels like it's working towards something - instead it's basically a sting of scenes with flight jargon, political back-talk and scheming villains.  Even the feeling of being in the pilot's seat is spoiled - our characters engage in the same easygoing dialog that you expect to hear from people schmoozing on the ground but never from people strapped into a high-performance fighter jet flying over enemy territory.  The realism is debatable, but its drag on the plot is painfully obvious.  Some howlers however aren't so much technical but fall into that realm of he human conscious for which there is no on-line directory.  For all pretensions of being a maverick, McLanahan is a textbook hero, while a thinly veiled versions of real-life liberals make this less a technothriller than a high-tech Alan Drury novel.  I should have realized something was wrong when Brown created as a love interest, a beautiful Saudi female soldier - this from a country where women aren't aloowed to drive or show their faces.	2005-03-22

It's thin, burdened by an outrageous plot twist, but fun. <br /> <br />As with all Pitt books, this one begins in the past - in this case the late WWII-era disappearance of a cargo plane called \\"Vixen-03\\" which of course is carrying a super-secret cargo.  Pitt stumbles on the wreckage of the airplane years later, learning that her cargo includes naval shells armed with an engineered bacteriologic agent more deadly than its designers had imagined.  He also finds that somebody has already beaten him to some of the cargo. <br /> <br />On the other side of the world, South Africa's ruling white regime engineers a bizarre plot to attack Washington DC using a mothballed American battleship loaded with WWII surplus ammo, and implicate their communist backed enemies for the deed.  Nobody involved in that plot, it seems, has any idea that there's anything unusual about their ammo (any more than your typical 16\\" artillery shell).  It's a race against time for Pitt to link the plot (codenamed \\"wildflower\\") to the missing shells.  But can he save Washington from annihilation? <br /> <br />Thin, but fun.  Pitt brings enough bravado for several books (he stares down some would-be blackmailers with aplomb), while the action shows no shortage of surprises.  Though thin, it's still better than the newer NUMA novels.	2005-03-21
US	49374774	R1BHR17EUC5NHI	0425115291	664914773	Silver Tower	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good technothriller	\\"Silver Tower\\" is a huge American space station armed with a first generation, space-based laser weapon.  As American and Soviet forces converge on Iran (I read this book in 1988 - it was hardly dated; preposterous perhaps but not dated) the Americans are desperate to get the revolutionary \\"Skybolt\\" system operational.  Russian forces have assets of their own - a new aircraft carrier, and orbital fighter-craft.  Character development takes a backseat to the action - but that's sprawling, with action at sea and in space.  While the prose are weighed down in that Dale Brown way, the fact that \\"Tower\\" is unconnected with his other books (starring Pat Mclanahan and Brad Elliot) means that the story comes without the baggage of the \\"Old Dog\\" books.  Characters seem warmly awed by their technology when they should be wary of it, and the implications that Skybolt poses for nuclear disarmament are barely touched on (you'd think there'd be more talk about how it negates MAD and arguably makes nuclear war more likely). <br /> <br />That said, \\"Tower\\" is satisfying and not to trying on the senses.  Brown convincingly sketches the worldwide military crisis and the new generation of weaponry making it harder to resist starting WWIII.	2005-03-21

China" epic.	\\"Skymasters\\" follows the typical formula for Brown's technothrillers, though the execution rises above the pack in comparison to other books. <br /> <br />In \\"Skymasters\\", the development of a new technology for launching surveillance satellites from the backs of modified airliners coincides with Chinese aggression against the Philippines.  An overzealous Chinese admiral attacks the Philippines with a nuclear weapon.  Rather than hit back with stealthy forces, Americans use a wide array of warplanes - B-1's, B-52's, the \\"Stealth Bomber\\" in what comes closest to WWIII than you'd get in most of Brown's other novels.  Though Pat Mclanahan is here, \\"Skymasters\\" is very much an ensemble piece, rising above being the story of \\"the world v. Mclanahan\\", and the brute force required to fight the Chinese means that the battle isn't the clean push-button warfare that typifies Brown's other books.  You get a better sense of being inside the cockpit of one of these airplanes than in other books, though it's still largely a matter of reading from computer screens.  Definitely a worthy Brown read.	2005-03-16

(A Dell book)	Books	4	21	22	N	N	Mixes of "Fountainhead" & "Red October"	\\"Blow Negative\\" (and what a title!) tells the fictionalized story of the men who invented the nuclear navy.  The \\"hero\\" is Sampson Greice, an obvious stand-in for Hymam Rickover, who pushes ahead various innovations that will make obsolete the diesel-electric submarines of two world wars and take the US Navy into the next century.  The story is largely told through the eyes of Lt. Joy, a former destroyer sailor now consigned to submarines.  In the years immediately following the end of WWII, Joy finds himself reluctantly aboard Greice's aging submarine, but manages to make something of a transition to the otherworldly ways of the \\"Silent Service\\".  Through other crewmen, Joy learns the two marks that have made Greice an outcast among other officers: his unconventional ideas about the next generation of submarines (subs with steam engines?  subs armed with missiles?  Subs with vertical launch tubes?) and the fact that he's pretty much hated by his superiors.  After a complicated string of events - thankfully depicted from within the sub - Joy gets his dolphins, yet is nearly killed in a catastrophe that all but destroys the sub and virtually ends Greice's career.  Joy, once a man willing to follow a crowd, nevertheless matures, tracks Greice down to an obscure Naval Research command, and joins his crusade to bring the navy into the next century (even as the present century wasn't quite half over). <br /> <br />\\"Blow\\" is fun - probably more now than it was when first written.  In an era with cookie-cutter \\"Pat Robinson\\" novels, it's refreshing to find something as old as \\"Blow\\" which has a very period feel to it.  Apart from the fact that it is a novel, it's still historically suspect.  While Admiral Rickover was outspoken on many issues, Greice speaks barely a word for the first half of the story - and much of what we know of him comes from his enemies.  Unlike the real Rickover, Greice actually has experience with subs as fighting machines.  That said, the book alsogives short shrift to Greice's resilience - after the tragedy early in the book, we lose sight of him and don't meet up with him again until he's ensconced in the command that will create the first generation of SSN's.  How Greice managed that bit of career resurrection is not quite explored, and we see little of subs themselves once he goes to work on the nuclear navy. <br /> <br />That said, \\"Blow\\" is still a must-read, a biting near-satire of the technothriller before that term ever really existed.  \\"Blow\\" gives us insecure and in-over-their-heads submariners in dangerous ships instead of the typical mechanized officers in cutting-edge submarines.  It's over the top, full bodied and seldom droops into skim-worthy.  If you can find a copy of this anywhere, grab one.	2005-03-11

Nevertheless, like sharks and predatory litigators, \\"Angels\\" follows a form that is coolly efficient and undeniably thrilling.    THE PLOT should come as no surprise to any vet of Brown's other stuff - a brilliant physicist on the verge of announcing a scientific breakthrough with theological implications (he was also a Catholic priest) is found in his lab brutally murdered.  The only clue to his death is a diabolical symbol branded into the victim's chest - an \\"ambigram\\" (capable of being read upside down) pointing towards the dread Illuminati.  A fabled secret order with an ancient hatred of all religion (they were originally scientists, born of the purported split between science and religion created by the Galilieo affair), the Illuminati now threaten to use their victim's breakthrough as a horrific weapon against the seat of the Papacy.  Employing an (...) who works like a one-man killing machine schooled in the ancient arts of death, the Illuminati plot seems planned to coincide with the oncoming conclave - the elaborate and ancient ritual designed to find a successor for the recently passed Pontiff.  The only clues to the cracking the plot are the arcane and seemingly impenetrable messages and symbols left behind by the killer and in the pages of the Illuminati documents in the archives of the Vatican.  All is lost...unless you've got a Harvard-Trained symbologist handy.    That's right, Rob Langdon, hero of DVC is back.  This time, he faces a tighter deadline, and more tangible threat - the Illuminati threaten elaborate and visible murders of Cardinals tagged as front-runners for the papal throne; the  their plot culminates with the obliteration of the Vatican.  Like DVC, \\"Angels\\" succeeds because it keeps from devolving into a crypto-history lesson (in which Langdon schools the rest of the characters and Brown's readers about otherwise pointless arcane, if only to warn us never to challenge him to a home-game version of \\"The Weakest Link\\".)  \\"Angels\\" also succeeds in its pacing of surprises - which are many.  Brown doesn't delay dropping the next big twist on us until right before we've gotten over the shock of the last one.  It's preposterous fun, and intolerable only for those who take it seriously.	2005-02-20

Pitt, as we all know, is the larger-than-life adventurer who gamely puts his life on the line working as a diver for the National Underwater Marine Agency - NUMA.  (Though a civilian agency whose mission is nothing more exotic than researching anything below the waves, NUMA rotunely crosses paths with mercenaries, arch-criminals, wicked corporate marauders, would be world-conquerors, insane villains and other all-round baddies.)  In PV, Pitt is called on to find a missing nuclear attack sub, one that disappeared with no explanation.  Luckily, a fragment of what might be the sub's final hours, happens to find its way to Dirk Pitt, who just happens to be in the same...ocean.  Unfortunately, that ocean is the deceptively named Pacific, the largest ocean on earth, and a vortex of ships, crews and lives.  Can Pitt find the sub and solve the riddle of her disappearance? <br /> <br />Okay, there's no doubt that Pitt will do all the above, and tangle with a ferocious enemy while romancing an exotic mystery woman.  In short, it manages to be just like every other Pitt novel, yet delivers the goods.  Still, it's a slim story, not full-blooded and globe-trotting like \\"Cyclops\\" or \\"Valhalla Rising\\".  In short, if you're in need of a good Pitt novel, try one of his later books.  Otherwise, you're in for some decent, if not terribly shocking fun.	2005-02-17

In the early 20, twin disasters separately take the lives of two men - diplomats for England & the USA.  Unknown is that each carried copies of a treaty giving Canda to the USA.  Fast forward to the near-future - America faces an unprecedented energy crisis.  Luckily, billions of barrels of oil is available just off-shore.  Unfortunately, it's on (or under) Canadian waters.  Heidi Milligan, a USN Officer and frequent Dirk Pitt companion, discovers reference to the obscure treaty while doing historical research.  Knowing the implications of the treaty, NUMA and Dirk Pitt soon join the treasure hunt.  Learning of the treaty themselves, the Brits pull out the stops to secure it first.  (It's unclear if the Brits are aware of the massive petro-implications at stake, but they're not about to give up Canada.)  Routine, and hardly the globe-hopping romp of novels like \\"Valhalla Rising\\" or \\"Cyclops\\", \\"Night Probe\\" is still worth a look.  Like Pitt, \\"Probe\\" knows what we want, and delivers the goods.  The story also adventurously tries a less-than patently evil adversary - with Pitt facing a british agent who's bound by duty, but not given to the bad-guy speeches or grandiose plans.  He's probably the most sympathetic foe Pitt has ever faced.  For Pitt fans, definately worth a read.	2005-02-07

In this first entry of a three-book epic, we follow Will, Henry and Jean-Paul as they make their way to a redoubt where free-men conspire to seize Earth back from the huge three-legged machines.  Not apparently evil, the myserious invaders seem to allow everybody else to live peacefully, with only a single catch: at a critical age, they are \\"capped\\" - their head implanted with a weird metal thing that (we're to assume) changes their minds for them.  Not immediately rebellious, Will & Henry are urged to escape after a chance meeting with Ozymandias - one of countless demented \\"vagrants\\" who roam the countryside because of imperfect capping.  Not really a vagrant, Ozymandias gives the boys a map and a compass (alien concepts to them) with instructions on how to reach freedom...if they want it. <br /> <br />Though I read an excerpt of \\"Mountain\\" in grade school years ago, and even caught a strip of the series that ran in the Boy Scouts magazine.  However, it was the Fremantle TV series that ran about 20 years ago that grabbed my attention.

While I knew that they'd been written with pre-teens in mind, I had guessed that it was written on two levels - much as the show had been.  Unfortunately, it's a book you can finish in about a day, undermining the epic scale you'd expect from a story about either the subjugation of the earth, or a walk from England to the Alps.	2005-01-31

This third and final end of the Colossus trilogy achieves an end for ends sake.  There are no loose ends, but then again, it takes little effort to wrap up the slim complexities of the last book.  While \\"Fall of Colossus\\" was set a few years after the last book left off, \\"Crab\\" picks up immediately at the end of the last book's cliffhanger.  In \\"Fall\\", Forbin, creator of the world-controlling Colossus destroyed his machine using a logical problem designed by highly advanced Martians.  Ready to pick up the pieces now that the \\"Master\\" is no more (Blake, Forbin's reluctant colleague and firm enemy of the machine, is more than ready - dispatching automated battle-fleets to NY to bring the UN into submission), Forbin began to wonder if perhaps the Martians had some agenda of their own in abetting the crash of the computer.  In \\"Crab\\" Forbin meets the Martians who reveal their own plans - they need oxygen, a lot of it.  Their conservative estimates call for half of Earth's atmospheric supply.  (Though the Martians can neutralize gravity, no explanation is offered for their inability to fashion oxygen using raw elements we can guess abundant in our solar system.)  Stalling for time, and perhaps an opportunity to bring Colossus back to life, Forbin offers to build the Martians a huge device that will collect the needed oxygen and compress it to a mind-boggling 5 tons to the cubic centimeter.  (The Martians, advanced as they are, are sufficiently down-to-earth to confuse metric and non-metric terms in a single measurement.)  Meanwhile, Forbin teams up with Blake on an impossible mission to restore Colossus, with an eye towards defeating the Martians and ending a plan that may mean death for much of the world's population.<br /><br />I had already read fall, so I had no choice but finish the job here with \\"Crab\\".  The simplest thing you can say is that \\"Crab\\", like \\"Fall\\" is simply skimworthy.  You're curious about how it all ends, but the story never makes the trip worthwhile.  Once the Martians appear, we get the standard spiel that we got from Colossus - man is a primitive and self-destructive species, so it can't be helped if so many of them must die for a higher aim.  For a series of events that will sharply alter the fates of the world, \\"Crab\\" spends little time investigating how life proceeds under the aegis of the machine (or how things changed much with his downfall).  Characters don't develop, and the fate of Forbin's wife, one of the major motivators of the last book, seems to have been forgotten entirely.  Worse, characters don't seem to react to the events of the story - there are vague hints that the pro-machine \\"Sect\\" has become a target for reactionaries like \\"The Fellowship\\", yet we see no characters who lead that reactionary upsurge, nor those who lead the counter-reaction when Forbin re-establishes control.  The book never works up a theme which is defined by the end of the story, and the most palpable feeling on the last page is \\"okay, what's next?\\"hile.

Still wielding power over mankind through its hold on man's nuclear weapons, much of the world has settled into an existence not radically different from our own.  Nukes aside, Colossus also rules through a repressive quasi-religious cabal, \\"The Sect\\", that describes the machine as a god, with Forbin as its prophet.  Under the Machine, justice is swift, but also scrupulously honest (the computer is aware that scientists close to running Colossus are also members of the anti-machine \\"Fellowship\\", but holds off for want of conclusive proof).  Life is strictly regulated, but hardly an Orwellian-style police state.  However, there are the ESC's - hidden laboratories in which Colossus precisely and painfully studies the limits of man's emotions by subjecting ordinary men and women to tests of varying degrees of cruelty.  The ESC's aside, the machine also picks at the brain of its creator - Father Forbin himself.  What the machine is unaware of is the nature of an even more dangerous threat to its existence - Martians.  As Colossus submits orders for an even larger extension of itself, Forbin's wife receives messages over the radio - voices claiming to come from Mars offer their help in ending the Machine's reign over mankind.  The Martians first enlist Dr. Blake, a key Colossus functionary, and Cleo Forbin - Forbin's wife.  When the machine outmaneuvers both Blake and Mrs. Forbin, only Father Forbin himself can complete the Martian plan.  However, Forbin has his own sense of loyalty to the machine.  When the machine punishes Forbin's wife, that loyalty may be stretched too far. <br /> <br /> <br />Unfortunately, \\"Fall\\" is a slim book, and nothing therein delves into the baggage created by the concept of the supercomputer.  The characters have no depth at all - both Sect and Fellowship have their own greed, with the machine being a convenient focus for them to lash out at each other.  Though brilliant, none of the characters privy to the Martians' plan take the time to consider the wisdom of acting on behalf of Mars.  Worst of all, the Colossus-ruled world really isn't that scary or different than our own - with corporations using computers to sell us stuff or dictate our future.  Not a whole lot of imagination is at work in this skim-worthy tome.  The Sect seems entirely useless - being around if only to make themselves unlikable.  The Fellowship barely registers at all - seeming composed of only Cleo Forbin & Blake.  (Even the names seem wrong - almost randomly chosen.)  Worst of all, for a story that pits man against machine, \\"Fall\\" lacks any subtext, any of that unquantifiable stream of ideas that separates pristine AI from the flawed natural version.	2005-01-25

A derelict spaceship, a homicidal computer, an enigmatic relic of non-human manufacture that may be the doorway to the other end of the universe and the key to both man's past and his future.  These were the pieces of a puzzle deliberately left unfinished at the end of \\"2001, a Space Odyssey\\" and much of the reason for that book's classic status.  Clarke had a nearly impossible mission: how to follow up and flesh out the mystery while preserving the story's critical air of the enigmatic.  Improbably, he succeeds. <br /> <br />Nine years have passed since all contact failed with the USS Discovery.  Sent to Jupiter to follow a radio signal beamed there by a mysterious monolith found on the moon, the Discovery all but vanished into mystery.  No man built the monolith, and none could have left it buried under the Lunar crater of Tycho.  And none of the scientists could know that another monolith, as depicted in the prolog of \\"2001\\", appeared in Africa over 3 million years earlier, ushering in the dawn of human civilization.  Before reaching the recipient of the monolith's message, disaster strikes Discovery: HAL-9000, the chatty super-computer running the ship, turns homicidal, killing three astronauts in suspended animation, dispatching another to an almost certain death in space, and nearly killing off Dave Bowman, the mission commander.  Bowman survives, but only by un-plugging Hal.  Truly alone, Bowman rendezvous with another monolith, and vanishes through a stargate.  Emerging on the other side of the universe, he finds himself altered into something new by the creators of the monolith, an advanced race of thinkers that has found nothing greater in the universe than the sentient mind.   <br /> <br />Knowing little more than the deaths of the astronauts and the \\"death\\" of Hal, Americans have spent 9 years feverishly working to complete \\"Discovery 2\\", only to find that they'll be beaten to Discovery by a Russian ship, the Leonov (nee Titov).  Magnanimously (also to avoid any hint of space-piracy), the Russians invite Americans to accompany them.  Along for the ride is Walter Curnow, a friendly bear of a man who knows Discovery's systems inside/out; Heywood Floyd, a minor character from the last book; and Dr. Chandra, referred to in \\"2001\\" as the father of Hal.  Getting to Discovery, they will have to bring Hal back to life if they have any hope of cracking the 9-year old mystery.  In the mean time, the man known as Dave Bowman must learn why he has been sent back to his solar system.  Reaching the orbit of Jupiter and its moons, the Russian/American team finds Discovery and the larger monolith in which Bowman disappeared, but also finds their answers are elusive. <br /> <br />This was a great book.  Clarke brings surprising depth to the dangers of space travel, the emotional pitfalls of artificial intelligence and the search for intelligent life in the universe.  Clarke develops a sub-plot involving a Chinese ship, one wisely junked for the movie, but quite effective here.  In short, and without spoiling things, Clarke builds on the house-of-cards of his last book, without bringing it down.  Neither of the follow-ups could touch this sequel.	2005-01-10

Using tons of high-tech, most of it involving bio-warfare tested on condemned criminals, Area-7 scientists develop cures for diseases engineered by America's enemies. Unfortunately, \\"Caesar\\" Russel, a disgraced and supposedly executed former USAF general, seizes Area-7 and locks everybody - including the President and his loyal marine contingent - inside. Russel has implanted a microscopic transmitter on the president's heart connecting the unwitting chief to nuclear warheads placed in every major northern city. All will explode should Caesar's troopers locate and kill the president. Also, the \\"football\\" - the president's nuclear-war trigger - will signal the bombs unless the president keys in his palm print every 90 minutes. With his special shock troops, Caesar can easily kill the President, but he needs the Chief to suffer the humiliation deserved by all politicians. Unbeknownst to Russell, Area-7's South African chief bio-chemist has his own plans now that he's developed a cure for a Chinese bio-engineered disease. Unknown to him, some of Ceasar's own men have gone into business themselves - with the Chinese. Unexpected by them is the role to be played by Area-7's residents - the vilest criminals in America. And a nasty shock to them all is \\"Scarecrow\\" Schofield - the world's toughest Marine and the novel's hero.  <br /> <br />I wasn't looking for literature - deep characters, a complex plot, irony - yet \\"Area 7\\" still left me hungry.   Reilly not only tosses character development, he practically junks the idea characters - each is a walking mannequin who knows his dossier and never deviates.   (The book starts off with Schofield's nominal superior being described as a cowardly careerist; a civilian presidential aide is from page 1 one of those politically connected, vapid and craven morons who populate failed sitcoms. By the climactic end of \\"Area 7\\", Schofield's boss is still a martinet, while the civilian faces Russell's plan with a desperate call his stockbroker - sell dollars!!!).  <br /> <br />\\"Area-7\\" isn't literature, but it's no fun either - it's far too unoriginal.  Reilly fans like to compare Schofield to Indiana Jones, but he's more like one of those forgotten Indy-clones who romped countless botched \\"Raiders\\" rip-offs.  The story is largely a string of clumsily choreographed action scenes, none of which will surprise to anybody who's watched late-night cable or straight-to-video movies or played computer games like \\"Half-Life\\". (Underground fortress; hide around corners, watch-out for the special troops, kill, steal their ammo, rinse and repeat.) Reilly's idea of using a heart as a fail-safe isn't new either (read Nance's \\"Medusa's Child\\"; see the movie \\"Spawn\\") while Caesar looks like any of the disgruntled post-Cold War hawks of early 1990's novels and movies. Reilly crams so much action in so small a space, it's almost laughable - as if his books were oversized screenplays in search of a producer, but I can't even imagine Steven Segal giving \\"Area 7\\" a serious look. In the space of a few pages, Schofield hijacks a space shuttle, blasts into orbit, downs a Chinese shuttle, lands intact and escapes the spaceship before Caesar's men destroy it. \\"Area-7\\" is less of a story for a book than some high-powered 3D computer game - which would be okay if it came with the gorgeous graphics and sound and characters empowered with AI. (Reading \\"Area\\" probably approximates watching somebody else play a video game with every possible cheat enabled.)  Instead, the narrative falls back on Reilly's prose which are both action-packed and an action-suckage loaded down with over-blown verbiage and irrelevant technical detail. Nobody just carries a semiautomatic pistol or assault rifle - we get the make and model of every gun in the book, (even though the way they're used seems to make each as good as the other), its nationality and, where applicable, whether the weapon is nickel-plated or whether the magazine is curved or straight. Unfortunately, Reilly needs specifics like that because without them he wouldn't have enough to fill up his action scenes; nor would \\"Area 7\\"  have enough technical data for its author to write sentences like \\"what many people don't realize is that....\\" and win praise for exhaustive research and \\"chilling plausibility\\".  The enemy characters have less AI than you'd get in \\"Half-Life\\"  - especially in there choice of weapons, rooted in a love of high-tech rather than common sense (having trapped our heroes inside of a hangared AWACS jet, Caesar's commandos assault it with a guided-missiles, even though missiles can't be trusted against the plane's electronics; simply shooting the tires and its engines doesn't occur to anybody). Our heroes seem to be expert at just about anything they come across (with the marines capable of flying helicopters and navigating the electronics and cockpits of the Air Force E-3) and always seem to come out on top (shooting down a Sidewinder missile with a machine gun?).  If you want non-stop action that's actually fun, pick up a Dirk Pitt Novel (I recommend \\"Cyclops\\").	2005-01-04

Though \\"2010\\" was a worthy successor to the original \\"A Space Odyssey\\", this third book in the series is inferior to it in every way. <br /> <br />RECAP: the series concerns itself with a mysterious and never-seen race of aliens use living computers to stimulate the growth of intelligence in primitive but potentially productive life-forms.  In \\"2001\\", one of these computers - contained within an enigmatic monolith - targets hominids, early men 3 million years in our past.  Ages later, a second monolith is discovered on the moon by advanced humans, and signals this discovery by beaming a message to a third, and much larger monolith, floating near Jupiter.  Working in secrecy, Americans dispatch a spaceship, \\"Discovery\\", crewed by astronauts having no idea of what their mission is about, and helmed by the chatty-yet-psychotic computer HAL-9000.  By the end of the book, HAL has been terminated, and Dave Bowman - the sole survivor of the mission - confronts the monolith, never to be seen again.  In \\"2010\\", Heywood Floyd, the boring scientist from the first book, accompanies a Russian expedition to recover \\"Discovery\\" and solve the many mysteries left over from the last book - like what happened to Dave Bowman and HAL, and what's up with those monoliths?  By the end of the book, the monoliths have converted Jupiter into a subscale sun, turning its many moons into a miniature version of our own solar system.  All of these new worlds are ours, except for Europa - the watery moon that likely harbors life. <br /> <br />In \\"2061\\", man has colonized all of the Jovian moons, save Europa, and space travel has evolved dramatically.  Heywood Floyd, now over a century old, plans to spend his next vacation on a trip to Haley's comet.  Looking and feeling well for his age (though prolonged time in zero-gravity means that he can never return to Earth), Floyd is decidedly upbeat.  Meanwhile, Floyd's grandson finds himself marooned on Europa when a spaceship he's on is hijacked.  Clarke tosses in dissident Afrikaners, a mountain-sized diamond, and the possibility that the monoliths may have been damaged in the fiery creation of the new Jovian sun.   <br /> <br />So why doesn't this novel boldly go?  With \\"2010\\" being a welcome surprise follow-up to the iconic \\"2001\\", Clarke may have missed how difficult it is to flesh out a franchise.  Nothing much happens in the first half of \\"2061\\", and it's soon clear that nothing is going to happen.  Clarke maintains the same air of enigma to the monoliths that made the first books a lot of fun, but he gives them little to work with - they loom, boding some dramatic event, but otherwise do nothing.  The \\"action\\" of the book has Floyd's grandson trying to stay alive on Europa, while Heywood commandeers his space-cruiser, using ice from Haley's comet as fuel.  Bowman returns, this time accompanied by a transformed HAL-9000, now also an advanced being.  There is talk of Europa and the monolith's experiment with Jupiter being at a crossroads - interesting, given that it's been scarcely more than 50 years since Europa was thawed out, and what's that to the cosmos?  (How and why the Europans survived the radical change to their environment is never explained.)  Little actually happens, and there are none of the fun characters of the second book - Walter Curnow doesn't appear, and Dr. Chandra did not survive the return trip in \\"2010\\".  At best, \\"2061\\" is a passable novella, but hardly a novel, and certainly not an adventurous one.	2004-12-29

Robert Langdon, a renowned expert on codes and arcane symbiology, finds himself enmeshed in a conspiracy involving the Vatican, a far-right-wing Roman-Catholic sect, an over-zealous Parisianne detective, the Louvre's curator, his beautiful and brilliant cryptologist granddaughter, a secret and centuries-old society and the works of aLeonard Da Vinci.  On a working vacation in the city of lights, Langdon is called to the Louvre to comment on the murder of Monsieur Sauniere, its curator, whose body has been found amid the Western world's greatest collection of art.  At first, Langdon is told that he's needed to explain the mysterious condition of the victim - splayed to resemble Da Vinci's \\"Vitruvian Man\\", and covered with symbols hinting at a deeper-then-average understanding of codes by the victim or the killer.  The action ratchets up a notch when Langdon is warned by Sophie - Sauniere's estranged granddaughter -  that the police's interest is not quite academic: when first arriving on the scene, one of Sauniere's mysterious messages found by the police was Langdon's own name - making him the obvious suspect.  Skeptical, Sophie urges Langdon to run, knowing that this will only cement suspicions against him.  On the run, Langdon and Sophie - herself a police cryptologist - piece together clues left behind by her grandfather.  It soon becomes clear that the elder Sauniere was the grand master of a known yet still impenetrable secret society, one possessing knowledge that may shake the foundations of the western world.  Unfortunately, the order was not secret enough, and a mysterious assassin has managed to identify its key leaders and murder them.  Now only Langdon and Sophie remain to find and save the secret, pursued by the police and by the assassin himself.  Can they find the secret - and if they do, will it be enough to save them.  Should the secret be found at all?<br /><br />I admit I was prepared to hate \\"Code\\", partly because of the hype, but mostly because it seldom stopped hinting at an earlier Brown book, the horrible \\"Digital Fortress\\" - which also involved codes, code-breaking by unusually intelligent individuals, and a psychotic assassin.  That said, \\"Code\\" was at least satisfying in its first half and came alive in its second as a well-paced thriller that easily compensates for its weaknesses.  Unlike \\"Fortress\\", \\"Code\\" is more of an ensemble piece - Brown wisely hooks the hero up with other characters: besides Sophie, there's a wealthy and franco-phobic British ex-pat who knows so much, you're wondering if he's broken the code himself.  While Brown sets up the Church to take the fall as the novel's heavies (the ancient secret, from early on in the story, is one long suppressed by the church; also, Langdon's French pursuer is both politically ambitious and a loyal Catholic), a more threatening and mysterious character is soon made the story's true villain.<br /><br />\\"Code\\" is fun, though it pays to know when the story should and must not be taken seriously.  The novel has taken pot-shots for its bleak light on the Church, though its punches are light - signaling that it takes little in this day and age to establish a dim view of organized religion, and also that Brown doesn't so much as undermine traditional religious teachings as he does just present alternative theories accepted as true by his heroes.  The real villains of course are us - the ignorant masses who blithely weave ancient and highly spiritual symbols and ideas into our daily lives without making the slightest attempt to understand or appreciate them (yet unsurprisingly buy Brown's books).  All religions seem to thrive on this ignorance, in Brown's estimation, with Catholicism falling victim to Brown likely due to its longetivity - it's been exploiting that ignorance of the \\"deeper secret\\" longer than most faiths.  (New-ageism rates hardly a mention, and Brown never explains how the secret's revelation will have any effect on those who simply don't care that much about religion in general.  Brown hints at a shallow knowledge of Judaism likely confused with the Hellenized brand of the latter second-Temple era.)  The pacing so smoothly ramps up the suspense in the second half, that by then, you've forgotten how much of the first half involved Langdon simply telling Sophie various bits of arcane knowledge, essentially reminding you how smart he is.  The protagonists know so much, you begin to wonder if the story will leave enough of a secret for them to find, or if the secret really is secret at all.  You also forget how shamelessly the story trades on your willingness to presume that some characters may turn out for the worse based simply on their being Catholic prelates or simply loyal Catholics at all.  And you don't really mind how Brown's heroes rely less on common sense for the most part then on some obscure knowledge that just happens to come to mind when it comes in handy.  Nothing in \\"Code\\" is likely to change anybody's mind about.  It's a fun read when you remember that it's mostly a well-written chunk of pop-suspense - one most enjoyable when you don't try to imagine its based on the so-called kernel-of-truth.don't care that much about religion in general.

Seawolf	Books	2	5	5	N	N	this Wolf can't swim	With \\"Seawolf\\" Robinson recycles much of the plot of \\"Shark Mutiny\\" - during submarine operations against the Chinese, a clash of sorts (with a dose of plain old-fashioned incompetence thrown in) jeopardizes lives on board a US nuclear attack sub.  You almost get the idea that Robinson finished \\"Shark\\" and then realized that \\"Seawolf\\" was a better idea for a story.  Instead of a heroic XO against a whacko CO (as in the older book) \\"Seawolf\\" pits a decent commander against an incompetent junior officer named Linus Clarke...whose father just happens to be the President of the US.  Also, unlike the obsolete \\"Shark\\", the \\"Seawolf\\" is America's most revolutionary deep-diving killing machine - I can imagine the howls that should have appeared in any story involving a decision to send America's most advanced sub into such politically charged waters.  When the President's son screws up, the sub and crew are captured, and it's the SEALS to the rescue - recalling, again, both \\"Shark\\" and the also similarly titled \\"Attack of the Seawolf\\" by Michael Dimercurio.  Back at home, Robinson's hero, Arnold Morgan, has to face down both the Chinese and his increasingly erratic boss.  Once the SEALS have done their work, a brief court battle (remember \\"Shark\\") brews up in which Clarke tries to prove that he wasn't incompetent, and in which Robinson adds lawyers to the coterie of villains that Robinson strikes at with his prose.  Robinson does less to flesh out his themes, than repeat them over and over - we know who's guilty and who's not.  Rather than probe the layers of his characters, Robinson immediately decides which ones are idiots, and which ones are brilliant - and that none will surprise us.  The dialog is as laughably implausible as ever, moreso because Robinson is sure he's serious (the nickname Morgan bestows on an unlikeable Chinese is not as ridiculous as the idea that a grown man would resort to one).  Horribly written, nothing in the book establishes its above-average technical detail - and in the internet age, surely I expect better than some technical specs I can find myself.  Robinson's political bent seems understated (compared to his other books that is) though not absent - the media is still a liberal weapon, which is cute given that Robinson himself is part of that self-same media.  Lest any criticize this as a rotten-review with an agenda, I'd recommend instead \\"Bravo Romeo\\" by Ralph Peters.  Peters, arguably, has an agenda as well, but dignifies a broader view using more textured characters, a truer eye for details and excellent prose.	2004-08-30

It's \\"The Bear's Tears\\" - the novel released in the states as \\"Lion's Run\\".  Craig Thomas returns us to the office of British Intel boss Kenneth Aubrey - the man who sent Clint Eastwood to Russia in the movie \\"Firefox\\".  (Eastwood's Mitchell Gant is not one of Thomas's recurring characters to return here, though).  The plot has Aubrey set-up by the Russians for treason.  Set in present day (the 1980's, actually) as Aubrey is about to help a KGB colonel defect to the west, Aubrey's superiors learn that their spy chief was himself \\"turned\\" by the Russians in 1946.  Disgraced and arrested, Aubrey is replaced by Babbington on the eve of an agency consolidation that will join various unconnected British intelligence agencies into a single service.  Of course the charges are bogus - part of an elaborate Soviet plot to protect the real traitor and bring Aubrey over to the east.  Aubrey's only hope is Patrick Hyde, a young former soldier (SAS, I think) who's the action hero of the story.  To get the evidence that will clear Aubrey and unmask the real traitor, Hyde will have to plunge into the hottest war zone of (then) Soviet-occupied Afghanistan, and find the one man who is both responsible for the Aubrey conspiracy and more than anybody else on Earth, wants Hyde dead.  Meanwhile, under guard, Aubrey concocts a plan of his own, as Thomas hints that his framed spymaster really does have something to hide. <br /> <br />\\"Bear's Tears\\" is an excellent thriller built upon compelling characters and non-stop action.  Rather than the cardboard cut-outs of other books, those in Thomas's novels grab you and never let go.  Though \\"Tears\\" features characters and refers to situations that occur in other books, it's still self-contained - it could be the first Thomas novel you'll ever pick up, but it won't likely be your last.	2004-08-27

The plot tells two converging stories - Jimmy's ascension to power, and the desperate plan he concocts to hold his place as the mideast crumbles beneath him.  Though mideastern, Karami is not Moslem - he's Christian Lebanese, and he's spent much of his life away from home, he's less a fixture of \\"le oriente\\" than the avarice of global commerce.  The story opens in the late 1960's - with Jimmy's position brought to the brink by a Beirut banking crisis in late 1966.  The \\"Six-Day War\\" only exacerbates the situation for Karami, who lives by making constant deals bankrolled by deposits in his Beirut bank.  Facing financial oblivion, Karami hits on an idea to spark multiple-coups across the arab world - knowing that he will then have access to the new regimes and the petro-dollars that will come under their control.  The novel then shifts gears - telling of Karami's origins as the son of a prosperous, but not quite powerful Lebanese merchant.  Brought to America as a teen at the outbreak of WWII, Karami will grow up fast - becoming wise in the ways of power.  We also meet the women in his life - his beautiful sister Felicite, and Michelle Ferrenbaugh - the daughter of a Senator in Karami's pocket.  When the Senator resigns, he passes his power to his new son-in law, but like Michelle, the real power remains with Karami.  Since this is definitely a pot-boiler, power means money and sex.  Always one to spot a good deal, Karami starts small (in terms of women and money) and gradually surpasses his father.  He will make friends and acquire lovers - but only for his own use.  Nevertheless, an American oil company, realizing Karami's plans and the consequences it faces should Karami's dream realized, uses two of Karami's oldest friends against him.  But will they be able to stop Karami in time? <br /> <br />I'd seen this novel years ago, and was drawn to its suggestive cover.  Call me a dumb westerner, but I get a kick out of the stereotype of the mystic and dangerous east.  Unfortunately, \\"Rapers\\" is not only weak literature as you'd expect, it's more boring than you could expect.  Rather than some monster out to violate the world, Karami is just an aggressive businessman who likes to have a lot of sex.  Though palling around the mideast, Karami really is no more a westerner than an Arab - and the story is just a generic chain of business deals whose price-tags just go up (provided you're attentive enough to actually read them all).  The characters themselves are so detached from each other, it's impossible to even care about what they do and, by the end of the book, it's impossible to even care what has happened to them.  The writing is unbelievably trite, even for a pot-boiler - with characters practically thinking aloud.  It's clear that the author wrote a book that would allow him to chart the rise and fall of Intra-Bank bigwig Youssif Beidas, but one that would have more commercial appeal (okay, more sex) but would not require that he dither with the accuracy of historical facts.  I was hoping for a hotter version of Robbins \\"The Pirate\\", but \\"Rapers\\" just had no staying power.	2004-08-23

That said, I was unprepared for how much of my skepticism stemmed from the authors' willingness to believe anything, and mask their suspension of disbelief as objectivity.    According to legend, the US Navy conducted invisibility experiments on one of their ships during WWII.  Not simply invisible, the ship actually teleported from its berth in Philadelphia.  However, the little-understood process played havoc with the crew - even after the experiment's end, some crewmen would \\"blink\\" in and out of existence, become frozen in time or catch fire.  One man walked through a wall, never to be seen again.  Of course, the Navy denies the whole thing....    While the legend places the story during the dark days of WWII, the legend itself began in the mid 1950's, with the publication of \\"The Case for the UFO\\" by Morris Jessup.  (Aknowledging that Jessup is no scientist, Berlitz & Moore nevertheless refer to him as \\"Dr. Jessup\\".)  Believing that propulsion of UFO's (and perhaps future human spacecraft) lay in solving Einstein's \\"Unified Field Theory\\", Jessup encouraged readers to press for research in that area. Jessup's book caught the attention of Carl Allen (AKA Carlos Allende), who spent the war in the Merchant Marine.  In a series of rambling letters Allen insisted that Einstein had solved UFT, and the solution was successfully used to cloak a USN warship in wartime experiments.  Though claiming to have witnessed the event from deck of a nearby freighter, Allen goes further than detailing his observation - exhaustively describing the travails of the crew, Einstein's seeming retraction of UFT, his admission to Bertrand Russel that UFT was complete but had to be suppressed at least until after WWIII, the identity of one of the chief scientists attached to the project, and that UFT had anything to do with the experiment.  To get his point across, Allen/Allende even forwarded a copy of Jessup's book (heavily annotated with his own theories, many having nothing to do with the Philadelphia Experiment) to the Office of Naval Research.  There it piqued the personal interest of at least 2 officers, and slowly became the story-that-wouldn't-die.  A few years later, a depressed Jessup was found dead in his car.  Allende/Allen became something of a cult celeb, sometimes retracting what he had previously claimed, often warning against the ominous dangers of UFT even as he seemed to beg others to look into it.    Berlitz and Moore piece Allen/Allende together with what are supposed to be other pieces of a puzzle that will prove the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  Instead, the result is far less than the sum of its parts: Berlitz and Moore place far more weight on any of the individual pieces than common sense would allow, and they find a better fit between the different pieces than you'd get in a jigsaw puzzle.  Nothing in PE lacks a more reasonable explanation than the authors can provide.  At the beginning, and towards the end of the book, the authors mention coming in contact with others who claim to have met alleged crewmembers of the ship involved in the experiment - but neither name nor any other convincing corroborating information comes out (Allende at least included his Merchant Marine ID in his letters).  The authors add to the puzzle, but never actually establish that the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  An anonymous radar scientist, who doesn't claim to have worked on the project, clairifies how events would have had to occurr if the legend were true.  Another scientist - given a psuedonym because it would upset \\"the status quo\\" - describes wartime discussions on a project that we're supposed to believe developed into the Philadelphia Experiment.  Named \\"Rinehart\\" after a similar character in the novel \\"Thin Air\\" (a thriller inspired by the legend) the doctor describes discussions but never mentions witnessing the experiment, nor any discussions of its aftermath - obvious details for such a pivotal figure.  \\"Rinehart\\" never even mentions Allende, even though it had been Allende's letters that clued the authors into Rinehart's existence (under yet another pseudonym).  The authors never explain how they managed to find \\"Rinehart\\" - they need to protect his identity even though the government obviously knows who he is, and anybody else would have the same difficulty tracking him down as the authors of this book.  The authors describe how the experiments of another scientist in \\"electrogravity\\" never caught on despite their apparent success - suggesting they were suppressed.  Though Allende described reading stories about the Experiment's sailors in Philadelphia newspapers, the only article that could be found is obviously bogus: a xerox of an obviously fabricated article describing a bar-room brawl by sailors who mysteriously vanish -  but no mention of date, newspaper, or the reporter, nor  any specific facts in the article about the event, like the name of the bar or those of witnesses.  The authors make the barest efforts to answer the questions they raise, and then merely add more pieces to the puzzle, without explaining how one piece corroborates any others.  Though appearing critical and objective, it's impossible to believe that the authors haven't already settled on the idea that the experiment actually occurred - they explicitly question Allende, yet never express their doubts, let alone attempt to deal with our own.     But what's the danger of that?  I mean, who cares if they can get their readers to believe the legend of the \\"Philadelphia Experiment\\".  Unfortunately, \\"Philadelphia\\" feeds on our prejudices of secret conspiracies, and relies on our willingness to do so with little prompting - never a positive thing.  Worse, it's not even interesting - barely substantive enough to raise the sort of questions that would make a more critical investigation a stirring story.	2004-08-22
US	49374774	RYVT8ZMV6IKGS	0395365112	91947294	Half Moon Street: Two Short Novels	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Transcendant writing elevates two slim novellas	If you saw and hated the movie with Sigourney Weaver, you should still give this Theroux story a try.  HMS is actually two short and unconnected novellas - the plots and characters aren't related, but they share common themes about the dangers of self-invention.  The stories aren't even the same size. <br /> <br />In \\"Buried Alive\\", the shorter of the two, a man digs into the shadowy life of his dead twin brother, slowly but surely forming the idea of assuming his identity.  The end comes as no surprise, but Theroux deftly crafts the lifetime of failure that underlies the protagonist, a man who finds himself verging into what appears to be a more attractive life than his own. <br /> <br />In \\"Doctor Slaughter\\", a brilliant and beautiful analyst of petroleum production supplements her meager income through high-priced prostitution.  From the start, it's clear that Loren Slaughter uses sex for mercenary purposes (like paying the plumber to defrost the toilet of her London flat, or to customize a small fur coat), but becoming a call-girl makes her useful to others.  If the story doesn't grab you, Paul Theroux's writing style makes it impossible to put HMS down.  Spare but perfect prose highlight the faade of strength that Loren uses to make her life bearable - made practically unendurable by miseries of London life.  As with the shorter story, Loren's ends in a climax that is understated and hardly a surprise, but one that packs a wallop nonetheless.	2004-08-04
US	49374774	RF84DDMFBJ82V	0316105848	755102072	Flyboys: A True Story of Courage	Books	3	13	18	N	N	WW II history that lacks direction	For reasons that are implied in other reviews, I found \\"Fly Boys\\" an incredible botch.  The simple premise of the book follows a group of US naval aviators shot down over the Japanese-held Island of Chichi Jima.  A short distance from the more famous Iwo Jima, Chichi was home to scores of Japanese who could only stand by impotent as a huge force of US Marines utterly devastated their nearby comrades, opening the door for massive air assaults against the Japanese home islands.  The Imperial military proved far better at transporting men and material to its Pacific bases than keeping them supplied (Imperial doctrine called for troops to \\"provision\\" themselves - by stealing from others in areas inhabited by other people, and by subsisting on insects and flora in remote, uninhabited places).  As a result, islands like Chichi and Guadalcanal became home to thousands of Japanese troops barely able to feed themselves, let alone bring the fight to the enemy.  Desperation exacerbates the sort of hysteria already endemic to every level of the Japanese military when the war began, and the \\"Fly Boys\\" suffer their captors' wrath. <br /> <br />For his research, or maybe because of it, Bradley loses his way almost immediately.  Instead of learning about the downed Chichi fliers, Bradley begins with the historical roots of the Pacific war...and then works backward.  We see how Commodore Perry \\"opened\\" the closed yet sophisticated and highly regimented Japanese society to the outside world.  The Japanese honor system - epitomized by Bushido - was not to blame for the barbarities of the eventual war.  Instead, the modern combat experience of the Japanese was one both compliant with that code and extraordinarily humane (Russians captured in the 1907 war received treatment little worse than that for guests).  Bradley contrasts this with the brutal and gratuitous behavior of Americans towards both the Japanese and anybody they had fought against prior to WWII (specifically Native Americans, but also native Pilipino guerrillas and civilians).  Nearing and then entering WWII, Bradley barely touches on his subjects - instead rehashing more milestones already well known to anybody who's read anything about the war or military aviation (or who gets basic cable).  From the court martial of Billy Mitchell to Doolittle's raid on Tokyo; from the Battle of Midway to the fire-bombing of the home islands of the Empire - Bradley gives some marginal insight, but little of it bearing on the situation of the downed American fliers.  Instead, the fliers become extras in a story that covers the man's-inhumanity aspect of the Pacific war - having to share our attentions with other soldiers and officers on both sides.  Bradley not only forgets whom he's writing about, but never makes clear of whose perspective he should write with - Bradley compares the cruelties perpetrated by Americans in giving some shape to those committed by the Imperial Japanese, but did the Japanese know of \\"Wounded Knee\\" when they struck \\"Pearl Harbor\\"?  It's unclear whether Bradley is arguing for moral relativism, or merely demonstrating that the Japanese had done so.   <br /> <br />When it's clear that Bradley is writing from his own perspective, the result is a soft concoction of history and euphemism.  This is especially true of the title - nothing in Bradley's book gets to the meat of what it means to be one of the \\"Fly Boys\\", though he uses the term throughout.  In that vein, \\"fly boys\\" may be an image, like the one used in \\"The Right Stuff\\" in which pilots were the lone shining knights of the nuclear powered space age.  Unlike Bradley, Wolfe not only fleshed out his imagery, but managed not to be conquered by it (by the end of \\"Stuff\\", America has matured beyond its need for such archaic heroes, and the advent of the 2-man Gemini spacecraft meant that astronauts were no longer \\"lone heroes\\" - the era of the shining and supersonic knight had come to an end).  Bradley instead uses the term to refer to fliers in general - ignoring much distinction between the fliers of different services.  Instead, the \\"fly boys\\" were the answer FDR had in the desperate early days of the war (was FDR such a fan of naval aviation?).   <br /> <br />Other aspects of the war's history are not so much glossed over as simply diverted.  The firebombing of Japan's major cities is compared to the atomic missions of the war's end - with the idea that the two missions weren't that different from each other.  Whether one agrees that dropping a-bombs on Japan was morally correct or a military necessity, the fact that one mission accomplished with a single airplane what other missions did using hundreds meant that the epoch of fly-boy history that saw America's entry into the war was now over.  No longer would air combat require waves of American boys to fly into walls of flack mirroring the \\"banzai\\" rushes of their enemies.  Bradley missed that point - quoting Curtis Lemay's famous statement that more were killed in the firebombs than at either Nagasaki or Hiroshima.  Bradely is only concerned with the comparative magnitude of harm (in each case, thousands burned) and not with the ease with which that power was brought to bear.	2004-07-30
US	49374774	ROGXTL5ZZTF8A	0451167708	414154961	Good Friday	Books	3	2	3	N	N	lame thriller set in the Mid East	In \\"Good Friday\\" the US faces an imminent Soviet invasion of Saudi Arabia.  A fleet of Russian transports and escorting MiG fighters converges on the Gulf Kingdom - a move that leaves the Americans with few options.  They can't allow the Russians to take Saudi, nor can they let the kingdom become the flashpoint for WWIII.  Instead, the Americans decide to invade the kingdom itself, purely as a preventative measure.  \\"Good Friday\\" posits the moves and counter-moves of the plot as occurring within a short period of time and jumps between the White House situation room, the cockpit of a Marine Harrier Jet, Saudi palaces and the desert battlegrounds.<br />Unfortunately, it's all a mess - nothing comes together in this story, which remains a disjointed collection of scenes that do nothing to advance the plot.  By the middle of the book, it's impossible to determine whether the Americans really have opted for their nifty strategy of preemptive invasion, whether anybody in Saudi knows or even cares about it or even what the consequences of that plan are.  Key to \\"Good Friday\\" is that the Saudis haven't the capacity to defend themselves - they've got hot planes like the F-15, but they can't fly them that well (landing seems to be a particular problem for Holt's Saudis) - and they come off like the stereotypical Arabs you see on sit-coms.  Also crucial to the plot is that the Russian invasion force will otherwise be overwhelming, an aspect of the plot I missed entirely (I mean an airborne force is nifty, but what else do they have; also wouldn't that force be mincemeat against ground-based defenses?; and how far can armed MiG-29's fly, even when one way?).  The &quot;techno&quot; is thin here, and you'll get a better feel for the dynamics of flying a Harrier by picking up Microsoft Flight Simulator than this book.  By the end of the book, it's impossible to determine what happened.  But you'll have lost interest long before that.	2004-06-15
US	49374774	RLULJDK6UNY59	0764316699	366840698	Iran-Iraq War in the Air 1980-1988 (Schiffer Military History Book)	Books	3	18	25	N	N	comprehensive...yet futile	The 1980-88 Gulf War escaped exhaustive review despite its length, devastation, large-scale use of high-technology and its lasting consequences.  Neglect is especially true of the air war which pitted Iran's western equipped and trained air force against Iraq's Soviet-styled air-war machine.  Cooper and Bishop address the air war, but their results are as mixed and frustrating as the war itself.    The authors detail much.  We see how Imperial Iran thought itself the regional superpower - frequently clashing with both Iraqi and Soviet forces - and planned on military self-sufficiency prior to the Shah's fall.  According to Cooper/Bishop, the Islamist's rise confronted Saddam with an opportunity he believed both short-lived and never to reappear: Hussein believed Islamic Iran militarily weak, but also \\"knew\\" the Mullahs would be toppled by a stronger, more dangerous pro-western regime.  Iraq's second-rate military proves a tight fit for Hussein's outsized ambitions.  Still lacking advanced French planes like the Mirage F-1EQ or more capable versions of the Mig-23 fighters than those the Russians would \\"provide\\", Hussein knew he had no chance against a western-backed Iran.  However, Iran's religious leaders (again according to Cooper/Bishop) purge the Shah's military professionals (including most pilots), and nearly sell its advanced aircraft - including hordes of Phantom and Tiger-II fighter bombers and as many as 80 Phoenix missile armed F-14 Tomcats.  Instead, Hussein's pre-emptive attack and invasion turn Iran's leadership around - pilots are rehabilitated, aircraft are refurbished and a massive and determined military-industrial complex is built.      Cooper/Bishop's research contradicts the common opinion of the war as a non-event or that Iran's military ground virtually to a halt with the American embargo (most concluded that even with covert aid, attrition reduced Iran's fleet of 80 F-14's to 5 by 1983; instead the authors detail large numbers of F-14s flyingfront-line interception flights by then, and regularly attribute its kills to liberal use of Phoenix missiles).  Plucky Iranians contain the invasion of western Iran, then launch a counter-invasion.  Iraq's misfortunes begin on day one, with its botched attempt to obliterate Iran's air force on the ground (ineptly emulating the Israeli strategy of 1967, Hussein orders his pilots to hit Iran's air bases but unfortunately, they lack sufficient training, tactics and technology to cause much damage, and are ordered to concentrate on runways to the exclusion of vulnerable aircraft parked nearby).  Later, having already shown they could hit much of Iraq, the Iranians blitz a large base over 500 miles inside enemy air space, without a single loss.  The war grinds on however because of a tragic miscalculation by the super-powers: unable to allow either side victory, they keep both fighting (covert western aid to Iran comes in the war's early days while Iran was on the defensive; when Iranian forces entered Iraq, Iraq benefits from western intel).  The super-powers confused keeping both sides weak with keeping them at war.  Though the technical victor, Hussein emerged from war so saddled in debt that he remained a danger to his neighbors and the world over a decade later.  Though reform has been an issue in Iran for years, the war allowed Iran's theocracy to consolidate power - identifying Iranian patriotism with their rule and likely legitimizing a regime that might have otherwise collapsed.  Thus the war gave the world two nations weaker but also dangerous.    Several issues dog this book - the first being accuracy.  Though heavily footnoted, much of the information is uncorroborated.  Many footnotes only mention additional information without providing sources.  Even when reading info you're willing to accept, a lack of provenance denies you the full story.  An Iranian warplane had been in the air during the tragic 88' Airbus incident?  How do we know that?  While the authors claim to heavily rely on direct sources, some interesting nuggets seem more assumed than corroborated - notably Hussein's reaction to Iran's failed attack of Hussein's Osirak (nearly a year before Israel destroyed it).  Cooper/Bishop have Hussein assuring the Iranians that the reactor was intended for \\"the Zionist enemy\\" - a point that would have vindicated Israel's controversial attack nearly a decade before \\"Desert Storm\\".  Covert Israeli aid flows to Iran even when not corroborated in footnotes.  Lastly, the war's many individual episodes are seldom free of debate - yet the authors seldom describe their willingness to accept their accounts.  The authors skillfully debunk a claim of an Iranian Phantom being shot down by an Iraqi helicopter, but make their point too well: you wonder how much of what you are reading benefits from that same suspension of belief read.    Less arguable is the book's strikingly low professional quality.  Cooper/Bishop tackled a huge topic and amassed much remarkable data.  However, for a published work, their book is rife with grammatical, spelling and other typographical errors.  Confusing run-on sentences are typical, and you can't turn a page without wondering what the authors could have done with a thesaurus.  (One memorable misspell recalls the bitter fighting in Khuzestan, where Iran's forces confronted the invading Iraqis and extracted a \\"heavy tool\\" - youch!)  An account of the failed Nojeh coup by Iranian fighter pilots against the Islamists is detailed twice - as if the authors forgot they had already recounted it.    Also, praise to the contrary, the book offers few usable maps.  Those unfamiliar with the region will find it hard to compile the authors' dense information into an overall picture of the war or find insight into its campaigns.  I simply can't understand why there are so few maps in this book - it's not like they're harder to get than the remarkable pictures the book offers in abundance.  Neither is there anindex to help the reader go back and review locations, people, events or organizations (e.g. Basiji, Pasdaran or IRGC) when they pop up again.  In sum, Cooper/Farzad present a great primary-source, and guarantee you will need more.	2004-06-07
US	49374774	R28HT093SJYS8	0399150412	196052103	White Death (NUMA Files)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Not as good as a Pitt novel, but still great	\\"White Death\\" is another of the NUMA franchise books - stories written by Cussler and Paul Kamprecos which star characters from the \\"National Underwater & Marine Agency\\".  NUMA was originally created to showcase Cussler's hero, the deep-diving, globe-hopping and mystery-solving Dirk Pitt, but grew to include a stable of characters who carry the show in these newer books.  Though the story follows the formula of just about every Dirk Pitt novel, Pitt never makes an appearance in this one.  In \\"White Death\\", NUMA hero Kurt Austin runs afoul of Oceanus - a vast corporate hydra that markets genetically modified fish across the globe.  In true Cussler tradition, the initial confrontation is perfectly accidental - Austin volunteers to save the crew of Danish warship accidentally sunk by a ship belonging to a fringe group of whale-huggers.  Too late, Austin learns that the Whale-huggers - led by an opportunist named Marcus Ryan - were set-up by Oceanus to distract the world from a nearby fish-processing plant.  Sneaking into the unusually secure commercial fishery owned by the company on the remote Faroes Islands, Austin finds clues to a darker secret than Albacore.  On the other side of the Atlantic, Paul and Gamay Trout - married NUMA marine biologists - investigate the waters near an Oceanus fishery in North America.  For those who live nearby but don't work for Oceanus, times are tough.  Not that there isn't any fishing, only that there's something in the water that has replaced the normal catch, and it demands a really bigger boat...<br />Connecting the dots on each side, Austin and team link Oceanus with a mysterious and legendarily violent tribe of outcast Inuit known as the Kiolya.  Led by a figure known as \\"Toonook\\", the Kiolya and Oceanus are poised to unleash a horrifying genetically engineered eco-weapon of mass destruction that will give them a stranglehold on the oceans of the world.  On their side, Austin falls back on a wealthy but mysterious Spaniard - a Basque who traces his roots to a 15th century explorer persecuted by the Inquisition.  But will they be enough to stop Oceanus?<br />This is only my second \\"Kurt Austin/NUMA novel - the first being \\"Serpent\\".  It's still not up to the quality of the Pitt novels, but \\"White Death\\" is still quite good.  If it holds few surprises, it's a fast read, and the characters seem to come alive much better than they did in the other book.  Best of all are the villains - Toonook and the viscious Kiolya are utterly evil, but so formidible that you know they won't go easily.  Kamprecos/Cussler gather the respective forces together for a slam-bang finish that gives you faith in the future of the NUMA novels.	2004-05-28

The story of this first book begins with VE day.  The end of the war in Europe heralds a newer war with the Soviets.  Monopolizing and exploiting German technological breakthroughs will be critical in the new cold war.  In \\"Stormbirds\\", a cadre of USAF officers gathers captured German rockets and planes in a remote desert base.  They've got captured pilots and scientists as well - but can't trust them much.  Instead, using ENIAC, they amass a small number of USAAF pilots with the idea of forming the first of America's jet fighter squadrons.  Distrust of the Germans and their planes is only one the problems - our heroes must also contend with an insane chain of command determined to make the cranky planes work and fight in ways they were not designed to be used.  Kelleher obviously devoted a lot of time to detail other writers would have glossed over (especially in one unforgettable scene describing a hideous end for the luckless pilot of a rocket plane).  If the characters aren't exactly out of Henry James, they're better than the mannequins of other books, and the flight scenes prove the author has an uncommon interest in the adventure of aviation.	2004-05-18

In his last book \\"Warrior Class\\", Mclanahan had been involuntarily retired from the air force due to his efforts to nab a power-mad international criminal named Pavel Kazakov.  In league with the Russians, Kazakov tried to engineer a war in the Balkans to enhance the profitability of his petroleum, money-laundering and narcotics enterprises.  In protective custody in \\"Wings\\" Kazakov is nevertheless on a new venture - this one involving a power-mad Libyan who traces his lineage to the pre-Quaddafi regime that ruled Libya.  Nobody really believes that Jadalla Zuwayy is really the true king of Libya, but he is treated as if they did - especially the pilots, soldiers and generals who stand poised to invade oil-rich Egypt on his orders.  Susan Harris, a beautiful American married to the soon-assassinated Egyptian president, tries every trick she can hold off crazed Zuwayy (Egypt's forces greatly out-strip those of Libya, but the latter possesses a huge supply of neutron bombs that can make everybody losers).  The only hope is McLanahan and his crew.  Armed with futuristic weapons designed and built by the Skymasters corporation, and assigned clandestinely by a covert organization known as \\"Nightcrawlers\\" (and headed by former president Kevin Martindale), Mclanahan goes into battle with next-generation stealth bombers and combat suits likely inspired by Sigourney Weaver's power-loaded from \\"Aliens\\".  Unfortunately, bad luck strikes - and some of the Nightcrawlers fall prisoner during an ill-fated hunt in Libya for WMD.  Trouble is compounded when the survivors find themselves in Egypt, where loyalties are divided.  Back in the USA, the Thorn administration struggles with how to respond to the growing unrest in North Africa and with how it will deal with the McLanahan.  (The Nightcrawlers may take Uncle Sam's best interest to heart, but they don't take his orders - and they face criminal prosecution for their unauthorized activities; Thorn himself typiefies the opposite of previous administrations - he pulls out all but a shell of US forces from overseas stations, and refuses to commit them anywhere unless foreign leaders can get their own populations to accept their presence).  Meanwhile, the Skymasters company struggles to perfect a powerful laser-weapon that can be carried in a refitted B-52 bomber.  Their latest secret weapon however proves to be a nine year old girl who knows more about plasma lasers and parallel universes than her parents..or the rest of the planet.<br />A Dale Brown novel is a lot like one of those family get-togethers: you go to these things about once a year, and with some subtle variations, each one is pretty much like the one you survived the year before.  We've still got power-mad dogs, craven US politicians, tons of high-tech and some big battles.  Although the storyline spills directly from \\"Warrior Class\\", \\"Wings\\" has fewer than its share of references to older Brown novels.  The villains are as unconvincing as ever (idiots who believe their own lies) and speak in the least plausible dialog.  The technology seems compelling, but if you really wanted to learn about plasma lasers, would you really make a bee-line for the nearest Dale Brown tome?  For the rest of us, Brown's technobabble may remind us that we studied so hard in high-school because we never wanted to hear that kind of droning again.  Brown's President is a surprise - a good one actually.  You're never sure where he stands, but Brown isn't willing to make him a paper-thin baddie like Kazakov.  Instead, Thorn becomes the kind of counterpoint that Brown's books need.  Despite its title, \\"Wings\\" may have the least emphasis on what actually happens inside a fighting warplane than any other Brown novel.  Instead, Brown concentrates his emphasis on the \\"Tin Man\\" battle armor - motorized exo-skeletons that turn individual soldiers into walking tanks.  It's an idea that comes at the expense of his interest in military aviation that probably attracted Brown fans to novels like \\"Flight of the Old Dog\\" and \\"Day of the Cheetah\\", but the new technology is far too exotic to substantiate his story.  Instead, \\"Wings\\" is thin and unsatisfying.	2004-04-19

Instead, it's full of implausible characters and uninspired plot twists, and worst of all, it never stops reminding you how smart it thinks it is.<br />THE PLOT: a disgruntled/now dead programmer has created a seemingly unbreakable code: \\"Digital Fortress\\", setting off a fierce hunt for its code key. While the key to DF is distributed on the internet, it's encrypted by the DF. Whoever unlocks the code will have access to the ultimate protection against decryption. Hostile governments, organized criminals or terrorists will be able to communicate freely over the internet completely immune to detection. Fearing this, the NSA (the US agency responsible for signals analysis and cracking codes) sends free-lance genius Dave Becker to Seville, where the programmer died. Strathmore, the NSA's head code breaker hopes that DF's creator left some clue to the code key behind. Unfortunately, Becker isn't alone on his hunt... <BR>Meanwhile, back at the NSA's high-tech HQ, Susan Fletcher, our hero's brilliant and sexy NSA genius of a girlfriend, tries picking up the mystery from her end of the Atlantic, where TRNSLTR, Strathmore's newest codebreaking supercomputer, is busy melting itself down trying to crack DF. Unfortunately, it looks like somebody is after Susan's as well - from the inside - and we get the hint that she shouldn't feel as safe as she does when Strathmore is around. Back in Spain, Becker quickly learns that DF's creator had worn a ring when he died - but it's missing. Quickly guessing that inscriptions on the ring say more than \\"one ring to rule them all\\", our hero tracks it across Spain, learning how quickly it moves from owner to owner. Unfortunately, whoever owns the ring (even briefly) is marked for death by a mysterious assassin - a deaf killer who never misses, and catalogs his kills on a Palm Pilot. <br />HOWEVER: This novel was horrible at just about every level, lacking in style or substance. It's not only strikingly unintelligent, but strikingly arch. To read \\"Fortress\\", you'd think Brown learned more about cryptography and the NSA than most people cared to hear about, and thus crafted a novel based on his \\"insider\\" info about cryptography. (Brown's story heavily relies on a perceived ignorance of what the NSA stands for - an agency, he writes, that only a small percentage of Americans understand. Rather than showing that Brown is a writer who has learnt what most us can't, \\"Digital Fortress\\" proves that Brown focuses on remote subjects not likely to have a large number of experts who can effectively challenge his pretensions of realism.) Actually, I learned more about cryptography while writing a paper about the Walker Family Spy Ring in high school, and most will probably learn more about the NSA watching \\"Sneakers\\" or \\"Good Will Hunting\\". How do you like them apples?) Instead of intelligent clues, Brown's story builds on arcane trivia (the etymology of the word \\"sincere\\", certain technical details distinguishing the different a-bombs used against Japan). I was able to piece together some of Brown's clues, not because I'm smarter than most, but simply because I watch a lot of the History channel. <br />Getting past the \\"thrill\\" and \\"techno\\" aspects of the story, what's left is thin - Brown's ring-plot provides an excuse to send our hero across Seville, hunting the ring, making this less of a novel of any genre than a college-writing version of \\"Where I Went Last Summer\\" (complete with Spanish dialog repeated in English). <br />Brown's thin story is plumped, not with some redeeming characters of depth and intelligent plot turns, but with unbelievably stupid characters and unbelievable plot twists. Our hero is no action hero (he stays in shape playing racquetball), yet he manages to elude the hitman who has carved a path of precision-guided death across Seville. Susan is beautiful and brilliant - though Brown never leaves us doubting as to which half matters more (Susan is probably the least independent, most vulnerable, unintelligent and otherwise dated female character I've seen in any technothriller; even her smarts are just a convenient device to explain why she's working with the NSA.) Strathmore is supposed to be a cryptographer par excellence, yet he defies belief - he's so obsessed with DF that he rams it into his priceless super-codebreaking computer, bypassing security checks meant to protect it from viruses. He does this despite knowing that DF is obviously more than it appears (its code for heaven's sake!!). There's another NSA co-worker, a guy who's supposed to set off our alarm bells, but it's obvious that Brown only means him to distract us from Strathmore since Brown couldn't be bothered to come up with more characters. Like Strathmore, the rest of the denizens of NSA headquarters are so dim, it's inconceivable that they'd be trusted to run a third rate ISP, let alone the most sophisticated code-breaking computer in the world. (Typical for low-grade technothrillers, Brown is so obsessed credentialing his characters as geniuses, he devotes little time to writing them even slightly smart.  They're stellar when it facing Brown's artificial plot challenges, but in common sense terms, Beavis and Butthead would eat these guys for lunch).<br />By the climax, I couldn't care whether the NSA would be destroyed by the killer code, mostly because the author had by then changed from telling a story to giving a pitch for some splashy action movie, making the novel's Hollywood aspirations annoyingly clear. In short, storm some other fortress.	2004-04-19

In \\"Valhalla\\", Pitt becomes embroiled with Cerberus, an aggressive petroleum cartel that will do anything to monopolize the flow of oil into America (the baddies are actually Americans.  Though it's soon clear that \\"Valhalla\\" was written before 9/11, a more baiting author would have easily gone for the \\"OPEC\\" panic-button).  There prime target is the inventor of a revolutionary form of propulsion that will put a severe dent in the global demand for oil.  Luckily for them, the inventor, and his beautiful daughter, are both at sea on a revolutionary cruise ship powered by the inventor's magnetohydrodynamic engines - giving the cartel the opportunity to take out two birds with one stone (or in this case, one fire at sea).  To late to save Dr. Egan, deep-diving hero Dirk Pitt arrives to save the plucky Kelly Egan, and become the cartel's latest target.  Pitt, the special projects director for the \\"National Underwater &amp; Marine Agency\\", isn't a guy to take \\"no\\" for an answer (he's also the only hero left who has no problem tossing off bon mots like \\"I hope you can forgive my tardiness\\").  In protecting Kelly Egan, and shutting down Cerberus, Pitt will find himself tangling with modern-day pirates in the Pacific, dogfighting a modern-day Red Baron over the streets of Manhattan, suffocating aboard a luxury submarine trapped at the bottom of the ocean and taking on a rogue super-tanker rigged to vaporize a city.  He will also have to track down the mysterious hidden lab of Dr. Egan, but luckily for Pitt he and the departed doctor share similar interests.  Cussler tosses an army of ruthless mercenaries, a lost Viking colony a mysterious 19th century submariner and ultimately...himself (again) into the mix for another Dirk Pitt adventure.<br />Okay, so it gets a bit wearing at times, and Cussler doesn't so much blaze any new paths as much as follow old ones (he used the bomb-ship idea in the excellent \\"Cyclops\\"), whilesticking to his trademark brand of pedantry (we always know what everybody is eating, and what they're wearing).  Normally, the above would kill the story, but Cussler's brand is actually fun, and he doesn't allow dinner menus and wardrobes to kill the story, which manages to be both consistently action packed yet never a mindless videogame turned novel.  There's probably some stuff that could have been tossed out (the Vikings and Jules Verne plot-lines were interesting, but they don't really connect to the story), but adventure fans should enjoy it.  Cussler shows he can go deeper into a genre he essentially created.	2004-04-15

Lt. \\"Punk\\" Reichart, the fictional F-14 driver introduced in \\"Punk's War\\" is back.  (\\"Fight\\" is actually the third of the 3 books Mr. Carroll has written to date - and if I missed \\"Punk's Wing\\", \\"Fight\\" was the best excuse to rectify that oversight as soon as possible).  In \\"Fight\\" Punk is back flying F-14 fighters in combat - now in strike missions against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.  (Though Tomcats had served as interceptors exclusively since entering the US fleet at the end of the Vietnam war era, by the time they flew in the Albania campaign, they had been adapted to carrying gear needed to \\"deliver\\" smart-bombs against ground targets, and even direct strikes for smart bombs launched by other airplanes.)  Punk is restless while at sea - convinced that his will be remembered more than \\"Desert Storm\\" as the \\"videogame war\\".  When a carrier-launch mishap kills two senior officers, Punk finds himself bumped up the chain of command.  Not quite a mixed-blessing, Punk finds himself re-united with Captain Alex \\"Soup\\" Campbell - the glory-hunting senior aviator who put Punk and his squadron mates at risk in \\"War\\".  (Soup's credentials as a grad of \\"Top Gun\\" and the \\"Blue Angels\\" masked an incompetent leader eager to grab glory, regardless of price.)  The action ramps up a notch when Punk finds himself shot down over Afghanistan.  Now seeing the war from a different angle - Punk will meet vicious Taliban, treacherous warlords, ghostlike US Special Forces soldiers and their CIA run-betweens.  Back on ship, Campbell is forced to confront his private demons and a board of enquiry when - on his first mission - he takes out an SUV apparently loaded with refugees.  Officially lionized after being shot down in \\"War\\", Campbell knows that he has few real friends, and the Navy has no shortage of resentful officers ready to sink his career.  Will Punk survive Afghanistan?  Has Campbell learned his lesson?<br />Like \\"Punk's War\\", \\"Punk's Fight\\" is stirring, believable, but leaves you hungry.  It's not a big book - it doesn't seem that much bigger than one of the stories that have been appearing in the \\"Combat\\" anthologies - and it touches on many plot ideas that it never really explores (like the sloppy flying of some of Punk's fellow pilots, or the unevenly friendly relations between the pilots of various coalition air forces; we also meet some of the other senior officers of the ship and quickly learn that they're at least as out of their element as Soup is - but we see little of the friction between senior officers that marked \\"Punk's War\\").  Carroll's plotting is no-nonsense - he doesn't add that many flying or fighting scenes, probably to avoid the techno-over-kill that lesser authors use to plump up their thin plots.  Unfortunately, that would have actually been the better strategy - Carroll goes so much farther than most in capturing both the feeling of being in the cockpit of a heavy-metal fighter jet and the uneasy professionalism of those who fly them, that some extra flying/fighting scenes would have been welcome.  (The key? Non-interchangeable pilots with their own POV; also Carroll keeps the perspective locked into the cockpit of the F-14, so we're forced to see things as his pilots do.  It's a simple strategy ignored by the vast majority of technothriller writers).  In sum, it's fun, but short.<br />For a non-fiction perspective on F-14's in their new combat role, check out \\"Black Aces High\\" by Robert Wilcox.	2004-04-14

Taking a page from fighter-tactics of WWII, \\"Bolo\\" had swarms of American jet fighters \\"disguised\\" as bomb-laden and unmaneuverable bombers.  The point of the ruse was to lure the enemy fighters - Soviet supplied MiG-17 and supersonic MiG-21 jets - close enough for an engagement.  Normally, Migs harassed the more vulnerable American bombers like the Navy Intruder or the USAF F-105, but would escape to their airfields before more formidable Yankee jets like the Phantom could engage.  (Politically-imposed limits on rules of engagement kept North Vietnamese airfields off-limits to US fliers).  In Bolo, the Phantoms would mask their identities as MiG-killers by flying slowly like bombers.  By the time the Migs were close enough to realize they were tricked - it would be too late.<br />Maybe.<br />For anybody versed in the lore of air warfare, Bolo is history.  Walter Kross gives us a fictionalized perspective occurring before Bolo - official resistance from superiors, bureaucratic wrangling, unreliable equipment and other obstacles nearly doom the project before it even gets off the ground.  Much of the story is episodic - engagements between the Migs and Phantom drivers highlight the problems suffered by each side.  None of the characters really stands out.  While Kross makes fighting the war sound convincingly frustrating, he never really gets to brass tacks on the politically charged issue of restrictive ROE (which depending on how you feel about the issue is either a plus or minus; I think Kross strengthened the story not going into the subject heavily).  What the novel is really missing however is an explanation on how the pilots were able to make Bolo a triumph.  Tricking the Migs into the fight was only half the plan - all would be for naught of the Migs managed to out-fly their Yankee enemies.  Though American fliers of the Vietnam-war era were not known for their dogfighting skills (and the Phantom would never go down as the dream dogfighter) Kross's pilots wipe the skies of the Migs.<br />I think the real problem with \\"Splash\\" is that you finish it thinking that Bolo was a cool enough story on its own - why fictionalize it?	2004-02-25
US	49374774	R2SY4IAZ319WFI	0399148604	848765251	Wings of Fire	Books	3	1	1	N	N	thin Brown	In \\"Wings\\", Dale Brown's perrenial hero Pat Mclanahan returns to action in Libya.  \\"Wings\\" follows a virtual series of books starring Mclanahan and his crew of go-anywhere, do-anything-it-takes air warriors.  In his last book \\"Warrior Class\\", Mclanahan had been involuntarily retired from the air force due to his efforts to nab a power-mad international criminal named Pavel Kazakov.  In league with the Russians, Kazakov tried to engineer a war in the Balkans to enhance the profitability of his petroleum, money-laundering and narcotics enterprises.  In protective custody in \\"Wings\\" Kazakov is nevertheless on a new venture - this one involving a power-mad Libyan who traces his lineage to the pre-Quaddafi regime that ruled Libya.  Nobody really believes that Jadalla Zuwayy is really the true king of Libya, but he is treated as if they did - especially the pilots, soldiers and generals who stand poised to invade oil-rich Egypt on his orders.  Susan Harris, a beautiful American married to the soon-assassinated Egyptian president, tries every trick she can hold off crazed Zuwayy (Egypt's forces greatly out-strip those of Libya, but the latter possesses a huge supply of neutron bombs that can make everybody losers).  The only hope is McLanahan and his crew.  Armed with futuristic weapons designed and built by the Skymasters corporation, and assigned clandestinely by a covert organization known as \\"Nightcrawlers\\" (and headed by former president Kevin Martindale), Mclanahan goes into battle with next-generation stealth bombers and combat suits likely inspired by Sigourney Weaver's power-loaded from \\"Aliens\\".  Unfortunately, bad luck strikes - and some of the Nightcrawlers fall prisoner during an ill-fated hunt in Libya for WMD.  Trouble is compounded when the survivors find themselves in Egypt, where loyalties are divided.  Back in the USA, the Thorn administration struggles with how to respond to the growing unrest in North Africa and with how it will deal with the McLanahan.  (The Nightcrawlers may take Uncle Sam's best interest to heart, but they don't take his orders - and they face criminal prosecution for their unauthorized activities; Thorn himself typiefies the opposite of previous administrations - he pulls out all but a shell of US forces from overseas stations, and refuses to commit them anywhere unless foreign leaders can get their own populations to accept their presence).  Meanwhile, the Skymasters company struggles to perfect a powerful laser-weapon that can be carried in a refitted B-52 bomber.  Their latest secret weapon however proves to be a nine year old girl who knows a thing or two about plasma lasers and parallel universes.<br />A Dale Brown novel is a lot like one of those family get-togethers: you go to these things about once a year, and with some subtle variations, each one is pretty much like the one you survived the year before.  We've still got power-mad dogs, craven US politicians, tons of high-tech and some big battles.  Although the storyline spills directly from \\"Warrior Class\\", \\"Wings\\" has fewer than its share of references to older Brown novels.  The villains are as unconvincing as ever (idiots who believe their own lies) and speak in the least plausible dialog.  The technology seems compelling, but if you really wanted to learn about plasma lasers, would you really make a bee-line for the nearest Dale Brown tome?  For the rest of us, Brown's technobabble may remind us that we studied so hard in high-school because we never wanted to hear that kind of droning again.  Despite its title, \\"Wings\\" may have the least emphasis on what actually happens inside a fighting warplane than any other Brown novel.  Instead, Brown concentrates his emphasis on the \\"Tin Man\\" battle armor - motorized exo-skeletons that turn individual soldiers into walking tanks.  It's an idea that comes at the expense of his interest in military aviation that probably attracted Brown fans to novels like \\"Flight of the Old Dog\\" and \\"Dayof the Cheetah\\", but the new technology is far too exotic to substantiate his story.  Instead, \\"Wings\\" is thin and unsatisfying.	2004-02-15
US	49374774	R2R7IBAQ07IHAK	0061006629	388121391	Fatherland	Books	4	15	15	N	N	Sophisticated thriller set in a post-war Nazi Europe	In 1964, winning World War II and achieving domination over all but the United States, the Nazi's Thousand-Year Reich prepares to celebrate Der Fuhrer's 75th birthday. But it's business as usual for SS Detective Xavier March, a U-Boat vet turned police detective.  With the holiday looming, March investigates a suspicious death seemingly unconnected with the alternate history of 1964 in which, Deutchland Uber Alles. But March's experiences prowling the North Atlantic have molded him into a natural hunter, and he refuses subtle (and not so) hints to leave the case alone. While a patriot in SS Black, March's instinct's foster suspicions that all was never right in the Reich - over the seeming perpetual resistance to German rule in the occupied and distant East, how knowledgeable German doctors are on the science of how people dies, and mostly (though also most quietly) on the subject of those missing Jews. Estranged from his wife and son, March is in no mood to file things away. With the help of a visiting journalist (a beautiful and plucky American, of course), March's investigation takes him to darkened archives and the offices of high ranking Nazis very much alive in a fully drawn and frightfully convincing world. <br />\\"Fatherland\\" excels not only because of what it does, but what it doesn't. The author resists the temptation to spell out exactly how the Nazis came to win the war, preferring instead to drop tantalizing hints (The Nazis responded to Hiroshima by launching V-3 at NY - thus keeping America out of the war; U-Boats are now nuclear powered, hinting that Dr. Heisenberg finally got it right; remaining nations outside of the Reich's control are happy to lay blame for genocide firmly on the wartime Soviet regime - renowned as it is for its brutality). The biggest twist is that while established history remains a mystery, the mystery on March's agenda quickly becomes no mystery at all - to us: the corpse (ironically identified as a \\"founding father\\" when hissole criminal record reveals an arrest  in 1922 in a Munich beer hall) is found outside a converted schoolhouse on the Wansee.  When the dead man's connection to that location is linked to a meeting there of high-ranking Nazis in early 1942, historically adept readers will realize that March is on the verge of discovering the Reich's guilt for a far larger crime - the crime of the century. March remains appropriately dim, creating one of the finest examples of deductive police work through investigation - Harris refuses to allow the slightest intrusion of our history into his hero's thinking. Instead, March tracks down the other famed Nazis who met suspicious ends and follows a trail that leads him to a Swiss bank. I'm not sure whether the controversy over Swiss banks was as well known when \\"Fatherland\\" debuted, in either case, Harris' treatment seems ironic, if not prescient: the Swiss accounts in Harriss's book weren't left behind by the Nazis' victims, but by disloyal Germans possessed by the insane fear that (huh!) Germany might lose the war. <br />Harris also avoids the urge to recreate the dark gods of the Reich simply by dropping  names (Goering, Goebbels, Himmler and most of the Discovery Channel's usual suspects are long gone.) Albert Speer doesn't appear, but the author's drawing of undivided Berlin - monumental and insecure - gives the architect more character than a few lines of dumb dialog.  Heydrich (the guy killed by Partisans) appears, but only to add more mystery - March is never sure if Heydrich is actually helping him out of fear of joining the other mysteriously dead Nazis, or marking him for death. <br />Best of all are the people who populate the vibrant Thousand-year Reich. No revisionist or apologist, Harris nevertheless avoids simple villainy for the inhabitants of the Reich of 1964 - his Germans seem not slightly cowed by fear of their regime yet honestly ignorant of their victims' fate.  While a U-Boat ace in 1943, March wore sock not knowing that they were sewn with hair from dead Jews. In the 1990's, we're kept warm with our own complacency on history, and a sense of its immutability (we've watched too many documentaries and war movies to even consider the possibility of Nazi victory). Harris tells us otherwise!	2004-01-15

It starts in Cuba as the Soviets are packing up their missiles.  The missile crisis has been averted with the Soviet back-down.  As the Russians depart, they receive an icy goodbey from their hosts, their fraternal socialist allies - thanks for nothing!  We're given clues that the Cubans may not have been left empty-handed by the Russians.  Then the novel fasts forward, sort of, and we witness the destruction of an American nuclear submarine.  I love subs, and think I know a thing about them.  Unfortunately, the author has learnt more about subs than he's capable of coherently describing - I had to re-read the description repeatedly, and could discern only that it involved some catastrophic accident with the sub's reduction gears.  It became clear, once I skimmed past that section that \\"Ghost\\" demonstrates less a knowledge of technical details than a painful inability to craft them into a coherent narrative.  This was a shame.  Starting out, I wasn't sure whether this would turn out to be an alternative history or some thriller - but either way, it had the makings of a unique read.	2003-12-18
US	49374774	R2AIQ6IJUPRVHA	0553348817	543172974	Warriors	Books	1	11	23	N	N	lame air war novel w/questionable agenda	I've read tons of air-war techno-thrillers over nearly 2 decades and, having gone through a fairly large number of mediocre books, I'm still stupefied as to how this one went bad.  \\"Warriors\\" tells the story of a former military aviator who gets his dream job - build an air force out of scratch for a group of wealthy Arabs.  He'll get to choose the pilots, the trainers and their planes.  No longer taking orders, he'll define what the orders will be.  No longer stuck with the equipment supplied by the lowest bidder, he can choose the best - in this case, the F-20 \\"Tigershark\\", a single-engined, next-generation evolution of the Northrop F-5.  As the multi-nationally trained \\"Tiger Force\\" takes shape, the hero - an ex-USN naval aviator - muses on the essentials and virtues of fighter aviators.  However, regional problems (i.e. Israel) force the Tigers to go to war after all.  With their spanking new jets and world-class trained pilots, the Tiger Force edges out Israel's traditionally favored IAF to maintain and then overcome the balance of air superiority in the war.<br />So why isn't this the epic air war novel that fans have been clamoring for?  I'll start w/Tillman's questionable choice of characterizations for the players - the Israelis are calculating political manipulators who throw their weight around (the Arabs successfully buy F-20's only because the Israelis doubted the plane was sufficiently formidable to amount to a threat) while the Arabs are largely respectable, professional, only interested in defense and (most woefully of all) romanticized.  Unlike the Saudis we know from the news - who employ religious police against their own people while penning foreign professionals into separate communities - these Saudis are both modern and appreciative to their foreign trainers, and never resort to using political manipulation to get what they want.  While neither characterization is wrong, (the Israelis are not purely- noble, plucky and fearless, while the Arabsare not by definition xenophobic, illiterate religious zealots who think they can fund global terrorism and get anything they want with petro-dollars) Tillman unfairly uses different perspectives for the one and the other - cynical for one, romantic for the other.  Tillman compounds the disparity by dropping his musings on real subjects like the pro-Israel lobby and the Liberty attack of 1967.  While those subjects are ripe for discussion, it's woefully dishonest to lob them, uncritically, in a novel.  (Because it's a novel, the writer can bend the facts because its fiction, but since these fictionalized facts are rooted in history, it's impossible to say where the fiction becomes historical argument; since Tillman has authored numerous works of non-fiction, it's lamentable that he chose to address these issues in a work of fiction).  And lastly, the idea of Americans teaching Saudis to fly aircraft in defense seems incredibly ironic since 9-11, unlike the hoards of other horrible books that at least look less implausible now.  <br />Technical realism and storytelling (normally at odds with each other) also take an unexpectedly big hit.  Tillman's premise is built on a question - how would an experienced aviator build a world-class air force?  Unfortunately, he treats the premise as a technical one that can and should be answered quickly, rather than one for a book which requires that characters be challenged, that plots don't fall according to the plans of those within them and that we've got what to read for about 250 pages.  Dealing with a technical problem, Tillman takes the path of least resistance: his characters get the planes and pilots they want, develop overall proficiency in time for the big fight, and work for reasonable employers willing and able to fund anything.  Lastly, when the war comes, the tactics used fit those taught to his pilots perfectly.  In other words, it's a dream of air-war come true.  Realistically however, the war you plan for is seldom if ever the one faced (a truism I picked up reading many a fighter-pilot memoir), and both the equipment and training can be counted on to be less than optimal - even for the war as contemplated.  Wouldn't a better story have been one with aging aircraft, less-than-proficient fliers and an unfavorable political situation?  That story would have had us guessing about the plot or sympathizing with its Arab characters (instead of idealizing them, why not put them at a disadvantage and have them surprise us with their pluck?).  Instead of a book with characters, plot and action, \\"Warriors\\" reads like some dry dramatized study of a hypothetical war.  Tillman's experience in aircraft is not reflected in this book which frequently sees things from a \\"big picture\\" well outside the cockpit - real pilots don't have spot view.  Also, there are few stirring air combat moments like the one described by William Anderson in his memoir \\"To Fly and Flight\\".  Tillman uses his technical details to reinforce the same truisms we've heard for years - you must fight air power with air power (didn't the Israelis learn the opposite in 1973?); a pilot must know the limits of his aircraft; that pilot proficiency is the deciding factor in air combat - rather than tell a story.  The end is unintentionally anti-climactic, and is otherwise obvious from the first page.  \\"Warriors\\" could have been a great story about fighter drivers being asked to confront a well equipped and trained enemy using inexperienced pilots with aging and unreliable aircraft - in other words, a story which rivals the challenges of air combat with a few of its own.	2003-12-10

There's plenty of military detail (though it's circa 1976 - with F-14 fighters and 688 Class SSN's being brand new) and enough pyrotechnics to keep you involved.  \\"North\\" also has one other interesting ace: the right-wing conspirators face less obstruction from enemy warships than they do their own superior officer - a liberal, pro-disarmament Admiral who keeps both sides from nuking each other by convincing them that the attacks are the work of a rogue.	2003-12-08

With the Soviet State still in existence, communism is still the rule.  The agreement with the Americans is therefore on thin ice.  When the body of one of the ship's crew, a beautiful and bold Georgian girl named Zina, comes up with the latest catch of Pollack, the Captain calls for investigation.  Unfortunately, the only man capable of running the investigation is a disgraced, and probably fugitive former Moscow investigator named Arkady Renko.<br />Yeah, that's right, the guy from \\"Gorky Park\\" (who would also go on to witness the abortive 1991 coup in \\"Red Square\\" and post-Soviet Cuba in \\"Havana Bay\\").  If you haven't read any of those books, I see no reason why you can't start with this one - though they're all worthy reads.  Renko, a loyal soviet police detective, proved too loyal by the end of \\"Gorky Park\\", in which he unmasked a conspiracy involving murder and sable-smuggling.  In \\"Star\\", we learn that Renko was locked away in an asylum - probably to keep him from implicating any higher-ups in the events of \\"Park\\".  He is sprung from prison by an unlikely ally - KGB General Pribluda, a man Renko once tried to implicate in multiple murder.  Free, after a fashion, Renko knows that he's marked, and wisely flees Moscow, braves the wastes of Siberia (where car engines run all night long to keep from freezing) and manages to arrive in Vladivostok.  Desperate to elude re-capture, Renko takes the lowest job on ship - the \\"slime-line\\".  By the time of Zina's death, Renko hasn't left the ship in a year.  Dragooned by Captain Marchuk into the investigation, Renko pursues leads that may implicate the Americans in smuggling drugs, or the \\"Polar Star's\\" communist masters in using the ship to spy on the Americans.  Now out of the ship's hold, Renko's search for answers brings him to Nastasha, a beautiful but loyal communist \\"with eyes as black as Stalin, but nice\\", Susan, a golden girl who seems to symbolize the promise of American prosperity, and Karp, a viscious thug with a penchant for murder and a grudge against Renko.  Though Karp is an obvious suspect, Renko finds plenty of reason to suspect just about everybody - and soon all begin to regret calling him to the case.<br />\\"Polar Star\\" excels on its full-blooded and sympathetic characters and wonderfully nuanced perspectives.  (Is Karp really bad?  We're not sure.  Regardless of the answer, he's a presence we can't forget).  The mystery, the setting and the characters make \\"Polar Star\\" poles apart from lesser novels.	2003-12-02

Worse, both Alison and Michael have long been suspected in the mysterious death of Michael's wife.  Alison's predicament soon comes to encompass her way-out neighbors, a curmudgeonly sort of guy who can never remember what decade he's living in, a pair of unsightly lesbians, various other twisted sorts, and a blind old priest who occupies the top floor.  And when those prove not problematic enough, an NYPD detective with an axe to grind on Michael's neck refuses to go away (there's bad blood between them from Michael's days as an ADA, though he seems confined to nailing Michael for his first wife's death).  Alison suffers blinding headaches and horrible visions, forcing her to confront something horrible from her past.<br />I had to confront something horrible from my past as well...this book, which had an elaborate inner cover showing a horde of the damned (confirmed to be such by their soulless dead eyes) suffering the torments of hell.  I also thought that it had to be horrifying because they made a movie out of it.  Years later I managed to find a used copy of the book (under suspicious circumstances: I bought it from some guy selling books on the streets of lower manhattan, and it was his last copy!)  Imagine my shock when, from the first chapter, it became clear that this was the most overhyped and under-thrilling novel ever published.  Just about 30 years old, I can hope that Mr. Konvitz has learnt a thing about writing, or has come up with a plot that's more than just an extended novella, or can develop characters who are more sympathetic, believable or can simply do something...anything.  Instead, the plot behind &quot;The Sentinel&quot; is paper thin, burdened by pedestrian prose that never work up a decent chill, and populated by idiotic characbters who can't think for themselves, don't sound like real people, never become worth anybody's attention (they don't have to become likeable, but they're not even interesting) and don't even do anything.  There is a lot of talking, but dialog isn't this book's strength, with Alison and Michael using overly wordy sentences.  Then there's the detective - imagine every dated NYPD detective stereotype you've seen on TV since you were seven, the cigar, the flunky junior assistant and especially that pseudo-hard boiled attitude that says &quot;I'm gonna nail you for your wife's murder if I have to go over the comissioner's head!&quot;  Through all the problems that keep this book from becoming the shocking novel it promises to be, we learn that there's something very weird about the apartment, that perhaps it's the middle point between our world and a more unpleasant place, and that only the blind priest keeps the one from invading the other.  The problem is that neither world is very well defined (and given what NY was becoming, just which side of that door was it on?) and more to the point, we never learn why things are the way they are (why must the chosen Sentinel fit the bill as described here?  Why is this brownstone the middle-ground between our world and the next?  and who's doing the choosing here?)  &quot;The Sentinel&quot; fit a mini-genre of urban horror of the late 60's and early 70's - &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; and &quot;The Excorcist&quot; come to mind.  If you're looking for genuine chills, try &quot;The Search for Jsoeph Tulley&quot; a gem I'd never heard of until I stumbled on it, and also &quot;The Pear-Shaped Man&quot; by George R.R. Martin, but otherwise guard yourself against &quot;The Sentinel&quot;.	2003-11-30
US	49374774	R3AXLT1ATO17O6	0425114074	915543448	Top Gun	Books	4	3	4	N	N	great photo story of Top Gun and air combat (circa 1987)	This small, thin book was the book I couldn't stop coming back to in the late 1980's along with Heatley's \\"The Cutting Edge\\".  George Hall, a civilian photog, gets an inside look at the men and machines of the Navy's Fighter Weapons School.  With the notoriety bred of the movie (which had just been released), Hall was likely one of many looking to get an inside look.  Unlike Heatley, Hall is not a fighter pilot (or any kind).  However, \\"Top Gun\\" manages to imbue his pictures and words with a sense of what it feels like to ride a rollercoaster, and presumably what it's like to fly in a high performance airplane.  Rather than a book with some nice pictures and a few spare words, Hall locks on to what an incredibly challenging yet irresistible job being a fighter driver must be.  While software makers had begun publishing the first generation of flight simulator games, convincing everybody with an AppleII, Macintosh or \\"IBM compatible\\" computer that they too can be a \\"Top Gun\\", Hall's perspective reminds us that those who fly fighter aircraft are dedicated professionals who worked hard to achieve their positions and remain tireless in their efforts to keep themselves and their fellow drivers on top.  In short order, Hall covers the history of air combat - from the days of the \\"Red Baron\\" until modern times (okay - 1987).  In between, we have German pilots inventing Blitzkrieg, the heroism of the RAF in the battle of Britain, early bouts of transonic warfare in the Korean skies and the heartbreaking disappointment of the first generation BVR (beyond visual range) missiles of the Vietnam era.  <br />Hall's no pilot - a point that he never lets us forget.  However, Hall exploits what others would be a weakness, giving his story a rare objectivity.  (Similar work would be stunted by empty adulation that praises fighter pilots without detailing the challenges they face).  Hall also manages to find bits of irony in the history of air combat: Oswald Boelke crafts a set of basic rules of air combat, then dies in a mid-air collision having apparently forgotten the last rule; Allied pilots faced severe disadvantages in Korea in terms of geography, enemy numbers, politics and hardware - yet scored incredible kill ratios over enemy MiGs;  though equipped with mach-2 fighters, the Argentines lose the air war over the Falklands - due to inadequate range and a lack of tanker support - to RAF pilots who have crossed thousands of Atlantic miles; though equipped with a state-of-the-art fire-control system, drivers of supersonic F-4 Phantoms find themselves matched by MiG-17 pilots (the MiG-17 was a barely transonic descendent of a fighter Kurt Tank designed for the Luftwaffe at the end of WWII);  the star of \\"Top Gun\\", the F-14, is not only easy to spot in a dogfight, but equipped with an underpowered and unreliable engine - not considered a dogfighter, it was probably one of the last aircraft of its time contemplated for Top Gun.<br />Hall fills the book with the lore of FWS and air combat in general, with references to \\"Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering\\" by Robert Shaw; the epic final dogfight of Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham; and the legendary Joe \\"Hoser\\" Satrapa, a fierce and fearless aviator dragooned into training newer pilots.  \\"Hoser\\" stories make him sound like a cross between R Lee Ermey and the Great Santini.  Satrapa is normally credited with the phrase \\"there's no kill like a guns kill\\".  Hall is also the primary source for oft circulated legend of Satrapa \\"cheating\\" during a bout of mock dogfighting that occurred during the ill-famed ACEVAL fiasco (Satrapa \\"arranged\\" with his rival to shun missile tactics, and keep their battle \\"guns only\\";  instead, Satrapa dispatches his foe with simulated missile kills, twice.  Hardly a slap at Satrapa, the instance only reveals an unflagging focus on what air combat is all about - Credibility is DOWN, kill ratio is UP!&quot;.<br />If Hall's pictures aren't spectacular, (though I thought they were) he matches them well with his words.  Noting unfavorable comparisons of the F-14 due to its size (bigger planes are easier to spot in dogfighting, and the first to spot has an advantage that's hard to beat) are matched with a priceless picture of a mammoth F-14 flanked by its diminutive Top Gun stable mates - the Skyhawk and the Tiger-II.  Obviously dated (the star in 1987, the F-14 is already being phased out in favor of the \\"Super Hornet\\", and is expected to become aero-history by 2010) \\"Top Gun\\" is nevertheless a priceless inside look by an outsider who manages to be awed by what he sees without losing his own focus.	2003-10-30

As the superpowers have achieved practically working ICBM's, the era of the manned bomber appears to be over.  A british officer vehemently protests against the conventional wisdom which has lead to the gradual replacement of manned bombers with silo-stored missiles.  Though his concerns are specific to the west, his worries are actually of import to the rest of the world: replacing manned aircraft with missiles leaves the west with only a single avenue of attack in case of soviet agression - a volley of missiles that can onlhy be launched once, and can never be recalled.  With western air forces on the verge of losing their manned bombers (The US had by then cancelled the Valkyrie; the RAF had no replacement for its Vulcan bombers), RAF officers hit on an outrageous plan to shock American war planners out of their torpor.<br />Not an especially deep work of narrative fiction, &quot;The Penetrators&quot; is still a noteworthy peice of cold-war frisson, quite dated, but enjoyably so.  (The manned-bomber v. missiles argument began to fade away by Vietnam, as more localized conflicts made the use of ICBM's irrelevant; the focus shifted to more sophisticated delivery systems for conventional weaponry.)  Also, there are no villains.  It's actually interesting  to have a technothriller w/o the shifty-eyed bad-guys who typically infest such books. Instead, we have credible people with different ideas of what's best for America - even if they're compulsion to be well-meaning requires that they push the US to the point of WWIII.	2003-10-26

(Dan Lenson Novels)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Great naval chiller	In \\"The Circle\\", a young Junior navy officer finally goes to sea.  Unfortunately for everybody aboard, the officer is Dan Lenson, the hero of a series of books by Dave Poyer.  I've only read a few of the Lenson books, but I've enjoyed them (though I'm pretty sure I wouldn't last a day trying to live through one).  Befitting his rank, Lenson's first assignment is the Ryan - an aging destroyer that can barely pull out of port without losing power.  Once underway, Lenson begins to learn the art and toil of running a USN ship - its complex mechanics and the labyrinthine passages of its crew.  Instead of the Russians (the novel is set in the late 1960's) Lenson must fiercely contend with hustlers among his crew - who deal drugs or otherwise act in manner unbecoming of USN personnel; there are also some officers who prefer sailing with a criminal element, and never stop dreaming of ways to exploit it.  Ryan's commander is a sage and noble captain, but Poyer makes it clear that even he may not have a full grasp on what his ship is up against.  Soon, with all of its inner pressures kept under control, the Ryan heads for the stormy arctic waters of \\"The Circle\\".  Lenson must now face the horrors of the polar seas, a possibly rogue Soviet submariner, the shift ones on his own ship and his own inexperience.<br />\\"The Circle\\" was a great read.  Poyer inundates you with naval jargon yet manages to sustain a narrative of rare emotional force (for technothrillers anyway).  Even if you don't know what's going on, you can at least taste the salt spray.  The story is actually composed of two halves, and I agree with the reader who found the first half the better one.  Still, Poyer's prose and characters keep you from going into skim mode, and keep \\"The Circle\\" from becoming one of those novels whose story seems lifted from an issue of \\"Jane's all the world's ships\\".   If you loved &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot; or &quot;HMS Ulysses&quot;, you've got to get &quot;The Circle&quot;.	2003-10-21
US	49374774	R1CHWV5BSU1SFB	0679740678	67210777	The Man in the High Castle	Books	3	5	6	N	N	surreal, mysterious and vague	The nightmare of an alternate history in which the Nazis concquered the world?  Unfortunately, the story dissappoints because it doesn't sound as nightmarish as it suggests.<br />For those who've never heard of this book, \\"Castle\\" offers an oppressed and subjugated America long since conquered by the Axis powers of the War.  America is divided between the Japanese consolidated states of the Pacific coast and the German dominated eastern-American sphere - though Dick suggests the Nazis as the more ambitious of the two victors.  Still a militaristic society, the Japanese themselves are comparatively benign - polite invaders who maintain their occupation from restricted enclaves while spending their time acquiring \\"Americana\\" (American swords, billboards, vintage clothes, jewelry, etc..)  The Germans have been busier, and Dick hints early that, as far as Germany is concerned, the Earth isn't big enough for two empires.  The horrors of the Nazi genocide aren't fleshed out - Dick stays deliberately vague - there are hints of a horror in Africa, while the futuristic Nazis share the racial ideas of the historical Nazis.  Between the Japanese and German dominated territories, a vast no-man's land exists in which people try to survive by exploiting each side's distrust of the other, guided by the I-Ching.  When the novel opens, we learn that the Nazis are on the verge of planning two new wars - one against their enemies, but firs a battle among their own inner circle.  At the center of everything lives the man of the castle himself - a recluse who has penned an underground best-selling novel which brazenly exalts and America that actually won WWII.<br />As a straight novel, \\"Castle\\" is an incredible disappointment.  It's way-out characters (who are dominated by I-Ching), unresolved and seldom co-mingling plot-lines and barely fleshed out tension will make you feel that you've read hundreds of pages of a novel that never starts.  Dick was supposed to have written \\"Castle\\" under great tension himself - constantly revolted by the evils of history's Nazis, but you won't see that here.  You'd think that a world largely dominated (or even populated) by Nazis would be outright horrific - dotted by death factories, criss-crossed by railways carrying fresh victims - but that clashes with the tone Dick offers, which is simply surreal. (according to Dick legend, the author was too horrified to follow up \\"Castle\\" with a sequel.  Instead, darkly inspired by the Nazi vision of a world divided between humans and seemingly identical beings otherwise deprived of human rights, Dick gave us the novel that became \\"Blade Runner\\" - with illegal androids subbing for genocide's victims.)  Even the focus on I-Ching is unnerving (once Dick has educated us as to what I-Ching is, it soon begins to appear as if he used it to finish this book).<br />On a deeper level, one can still appreciate the irony - not on Dick's alternate history, but on the alternate history created by Dick's fictional man in the castle.  We learn of his novel, \\"The Grasshopper lies heavily\\" long before we get a look at what's on its pages.  Knowing of its premise of a triumphant America, we're supposed to imagine that Grasshopper's America will look much like our own.  Near the end, when one of our \\"heores\\" looks into \\"Grasshopper\\" we learn that its vision does not stay close to our own for very long, at first closer to reality than that of \\"Castle\\".  The cracks form once the west wins the war and must confront what became the \\"cold war\\", and we're left wondering which alternative reality is really the alternative reality, and which is simply a funhouse-mirror version of our own - one in which an ambitious super-power has scarred the world with its costly mistakes, tears itself apart in internecine battles and seeks to spread itself into space, likely in order to escape the charnel house it has made of the earth.  Dick gave this story no ending, probably thinking that the scariest way to close a cautionary tale of an alternate time is to show you how alternate it's not.	2003-10-09

Recently orphaned Lewis is our hero.  Fat and friendless, he is consigned to his weird uncle Jonathan for safekeeping.  Unfortunately (okay, luckily for us) Uncle Jonathan is a minor wizard who lives in a strange old house full of spells, books and secrets, and topped by an ominous cupola.  For his middling powers, Uncle Jonathan is a strangely affecting character - proven when he \\"transports\\" them back through time so Lewis can witness the destruction of the Spanish Armada that Lewis had read about.  (Jonathan's imagery is compelling, but isn't above reminding Lewis that it's still just imagery.  Even so, the spell maintains the illusion until the Armada's bitter end.)  Uncle Jonathan has a darker pre-occupation though - searching the house for a clock built and hidden by the house's previous owner, a wizard like Jonathan who proves to be a wizard at all like Uncle Jonathan.  The clock, we are made to believe, is a doomsday clock.  What Uncle Jonathan will do with the clock isn't clear, but it's moot given that the clock has eluded Jonathan's powers of detection.<br />If \\"House\\" were about nothing more than the search for the missing clock, it would be one of countless forgettable stories about young magicians.  Instead, Bellairs wonderful characterization threads doomsday magic with the horror of being a fat, lonely, orphaned boy in a strange world.  Lewis befriends another boy, but the pairing leads to disaster in a slick plotline that leads back to the clock.  The wonderful prose works the plot like a kind of magic - told through the dialog of orphan and wizard-uncle.  \\"House\\" has a simple plot - that being lonely is as dire an existence as the brink of doom, but neither are inescapable.  Though not as complex a story as \\"Harry Potter\\", \\"House\\" has a magic that remains undiminished. (And unless Rowling can raise the dead, \\"House\\" will also have the drawings of the late-great Edward Gorey to maintain its lead in the dark arts.)  I first read this story while in 2nd grade, and kept coming back.  Like a great spell, it offers something new on each read.	2003-10-08
US	49374774	R1ZGSUI4SSHDFT	192999804X	998575984	The Blair Witch Chronicles	Books	2	3	5	N	N	....nothing left but footage	This single ed. combines &quot;mini-series&quot; with the origins of Elly Kedward (the Blair Witch).  The mini-series itself amounted to four single-story issues that had something to do with the witch, but unfortunately, nothing to do with each other. The art appears crude, though that's likely meant to emulate the purposefully crude style of the film.  Sure, we learn (if we hadn't known at first) that Elly Kedward was a victim of unnecessary prejudices of her time - that she was left for dead by the residents of Blair deep in Maryland forest country, and that it didn't matter that she might have been a witch when she was killed (if she ever died that is) when the brutality of her &quot;murder&quot; was alone sufficient to fuel 2 centuries of grisly death.  &quot;Chronicles&quot; pioneers the idea that Kedward was darkly fated even before she left the shores of Europe (having failed to bear a single child, and leaving two dead husbands; she arrives in Baltimore to find her prospective employer and his family already perished).  Unfortunately, the rest of the book is disjointed - the stories are thin by themselves and don't become fleshier in combination.  Two brothers - one of whom has lost his girlfriend to the town rogue - follow the rogue into the forest with the idea of exposing him; a newcomer to Blair refuses to leave &quot;tribute&quot; to the witch as his new neighbors do, prior to a deer hunt; a group of modern-day Wiccans (white witches) is hired to cleanse the black woods of its dark spirits; when the local parish can't find a priest to minister in early 19th century Blair (where the church keeps burning down before completion), a fire-breathing sermonizer proves far too eager and appropriate a choice.  The only common thread of the stories is that they involve those foolish non-belivers (or those who don't sufficiently believe).  We know that (w/i the reality of the stories) the witch is real enough and that those who lack enough fear are sooo dead.  The problem is that these stories lack a shred of irony - the world is full of fire and brimstone preachers, of insufferably benign wiccans, decent high school boys and just plainly skeptical men - why are these people singled out?  All of the stories seem random and are less about the Blair Witch than the idea of fear in general.  Best moment: a wiccan - the sole survivor of her circle - manages to find some protection against the Blair Witch, but even that falls within her malice.  It's a powerful moment that the rest of the stories never amount to.e problem is that these stories lack a shred of irony - the world is full of fire and brimstone preachers, of insufferably benign wiccans, decent high school boys and just plainly skeptical men - why are these people singled out?

(Remember how in 1986, leather aviator jackets covered in patches like some old steamer trunk were all the rage?)  With George Hall's \\"Top Gun\\", \\"Edge\\" occupied a spot on my bookshelf, but never sat unread very long.  Heatley's camera picks up life aboard an aircraft carrier - mostly on deck.  Though an F-14 pilot, Heatley also captures the adventures of those who fly \\"Helos\\", Hawkeye radar planes, Viking sub-hunters, Corsair strike fighters, Intruder bombers, tankers, and ELInt planes.  \\"Edge\\" is mostly a picture book - with little emphasis on telling very detailed stories.  Nevertheless, between thin blurbs from shipmates and Heatley's pictures, a very nuanced picture of carrier aviation comes across - F-14's going supersonic or dogfighting against each other; Sea-Knight helicopters bringing needed supplies; deck-crew managing millions of dollars worth of hardware on a pitching carrier deck; a mammoth warship is dwarfed by the vast seas in a great vista shot; stricken planes making emergency barricade landings; Soviet planes being intercepted near the carrier.  (I doubt that the Tu-95 \\"Bear\\" has ever appeared so classically beautiful by Soviet photogs.)  Mid-way through, Heatley goes to Miramar to capture the sights of legendary Top-Gun (since moved to Yuma) and also capture the (then) new F/A-18 which was just entering the fleet.  Heatley gets some great shots of aggressor pilots and their planes - McDonnel Skyhawks and Northrop Tigers with Soviet-style paint jobs - but the results aren't as dramatic as those achieved on the carrier (maybe the rigors of naval aviation have a way of creating their own narrative.)  <br />Heatley's pictures are incredible - it's hard to believe that they're being taken while the guy is driving a $36 million plane (one of his shots appears as a mural in the bar scene in \\"Top Gun\\".)  <br />While the pictures are unforgettable, \\"Edge\\" excels in the uncommon and still unsurpassed sincerity that Heatley brings out of his crewmates.  They're faithful to their roles as strike-fighter aviators or helo drivers, but aren't afraid to talk about their limits (we know that the Corsair doesn't come with the bells and whistles of an F-14, but its pilots appreciate being able to make all the decisions themselves;  sub hunting isn't a fast-moving job, but Viking crewmen appreciate the thrill of the chase).  If you want a more detailed story of Navy carrier aviation, I'd recommend George Hall's book - which has some great pictures to be sure, but nothing that can touch the visual splendor of \\"The Cutting Edge\\".	2003-10-01

First introduced in \\"2001\\", the monoliths - enigmatic stones built by an advanced race - provided guidance to the first generations of prehistoric hominids (in the prolog to \\"2001\\", we meet a tribe of ape-men, just descended to the savannah's, and hovering over extinction.  A monolith educates the hominids as to how to fight off marauding predators, and that fattened wildebeests can be as nutritious as a tree full of berries).  If not for the monoliths, man might have gone the way of countless extinct species.  Later on, at the end of the 20th century, another monolith is discovered in the moon.  The implication is that while the first device was meant to educate man, the second was meant to alert its creators as to his technological achievements.  An expedition to the moons of Jupiter to trace the signal left by the moon-monolith ends in apparent tragedy.  Most of the crew - kept in suspended animation - are killed off by HAL-9000, the ship's computer.  Another crew member, astronaut Frank Poole, was apparently killed by the computer while repairing a faulty antenna outside of their ship.  Only Dave Bowman survived long enough to complete the mission and reach the moons of Jupiter...where he disappeared.  In the first sequel, \\"2010\\", we learnt that Bowman was found by alien intelligence and evolved into some hyper-sentient being with responsibility of continuing the work begin by the first monoliths - an epic program to evolve life on the frozen moon of Europa.  Turning Jupiter into a min-sun, and its moons into miniature worlds, the minds behind the monolith nurse the possibility of burgeoning non-human life-forms within our solar system as a possible replacement for us.  Clarke continued the saga in \\"2061\\", more of an afterthought or an oversized novella than a novel, in which he broaches the possibility that the monoliths, for their seeming divine powers, are still just machines which canbe knocked on their sides.  Unfortunately, Clarke did little to enhance the premise with a slim story involving Heywood Floyd (now an aged retiree looking to guild his sunset years with a trip to Haley's comet), his grandson, South African expatriates, an unauthorized landing on Europa (the one moon man was not permitted to explore) and a diamond the size of a mountain.<br />In \\"3001\\", Clarke promises to take us further, but doesn't.  He returns Frank Poole - who wasn't killed when he floated off into space near Saturn, but merely fell into suspended animation.  Much of the first half of \\"3001\\" has Poole learning of man's technical feats (brain caps, towers that stretch from Earth into orbit) before returning him to space.  In fact \\"3001\\" takes an insufferable amount of time telling us how cool the future is before it gets around to telling us what the story is actually about.  That wouldn't be much of a problem if Clarke's vision of the future was all that compelling.  Instead, it's pretty much a hyper-advanced version of what we have today - replacing desktop PC's and the internet with brain-caps (an optimistic version of the sinister \\"capping\\"  devices of Christopher \\"Tripods\\" trilogy?).  Computing, Clarke assures us, is much more advanced - though it's still a matter of numbers (petabytes and terabytes over megabytes and gigabytes; what's actually done with all of this capacity is never really explained.  Clarke's futurism requires that this new age be more enlightened than our own, though it just as likely gave us more websites devoted to entertainment news and sports).  Near the end, we get an idea of what \\"3001\\" is about - the monoliths return.  <br />Unfortunately, Clarke's futurism kicks in - the monoliths are a threat because their observations of Earth were based on Earth's medieval past (actually our present) before the world became host to a truly civilized age.  Poole must now find a way to sabotage the monolith before it can inform its creators as tothe evils of our own age.  \\"3001\\" represents a branch of sci-fi/fantasy epitomized by C.S. Lewis as the \\"snobbery of chronology\\", in which technology is not the only advance futuristic humans will have achieved over their backward ancestors (futurism takes moral and cultural superiority of the future as a given and seldom explains how or why Buck Rogers or Jean Luc Picard never sullied their minds with infomercials or talk-shows; typically, some catastrophic event, like a nuclear war, intervened between our horrid era and the golden age).  In that respect, \\"3001\\" is so close to form, that it's the least genuinely futuristic or compelling entries in the \\"Odyssey\\" saga.  Instead, pick up either of the first 2 books.	2003-09-21

Ray Kerman joins British special forces, barely aware of his Islamic past - his Iranian parents blended into British society.  On assignment monitoring Israeli Forces in the West Bank, during a pitched battle between guerrillas and IDF, Kerman meets the beautiful Palestinian Shakira.  Faster than you can say \\"I feel the ancient Muslim within me\\", Kerman joins Hamas.  Now called Ravi Rashood, he he convinces some Iranian mullahs to buy 2 Barracudas - Russian Sierra class nuclear subs that haven't been used in years.  Armed with cruise missiles, one of the subs will sneak up to our Pacific coast and blast American petro facilities with missiles.  On the home front, Admiral Morgan, the National Security Advisor, and Lt. Ramshawe, a young intelligence officer, link Kerman, Hamas and the mysterious sale of the twin Barracudas.<br />\\"Barracuda\\", the worst book I've read since \\"Shark Mutiny\\", is even worse than Publishers Weekly warned - full of meaningless digressions so mind-bogglingly irrelevant, they don't even rise to pedantry and must be read to be believed. The submarine idea doesn't even materialize until nearly half-way through \\"Barracuda\\".  Until then, Robinson tells the story of Kerman/Rashood - his upbringing, his training and his improbable conversion to terrorist.  Spectacular attacks Rashood commits earlier in the book are supposed to lead to his missile-sub plan, but that idea sounds like something Rashood's Iranian backers could've thought up.  (Nothing in Kerman's SAS background explains how he alone dreamt up the plan or even knows a thing about subs).  Earlier exploits are meant to be spectacular (including a daring breakout from an Israeli max-sec prison housing hardcore terrorists) but suffer from Robinson's inept story-telling and in any event never connect with the plot to attack the US with cruise missiles.   <br />Robinson seems unableto remember what \\"Barracuda\\" is about - while Rashood travels to Iran, he writes about an Iranian missile boat, a Chinese cruise missile, and that the missile's engine was built in Toulouse.  Neither the missile nor the boat will figure in any action.  The science of driving and hunting submarines is barely touched on, but you can count on Robinson's chillingly plausible depiction of an Iranian breakfast menu.  Robinson will often introduce a large cast of characters - reciting their names and positions - but has them do nothing.  Robinson must think that I'm the only techno-thriller fan who believes that accurate technical details should be used to further the plot, rather than demonstrate the author's wealth of trivia.  His fans supposedly overlook stylistic flaws in favor of purportedly explosive plots and plausibly accurate details.  But there's nothing realistic, explosive or even very new here. Robinson (and others) have done the \\"rogue sub\\" plot to death (\\"Kilo Option\\"), and you can get more convincing and visceral stuff in Clancy, Craig Thomas, Mercurio and DC Poyer.  The laughably implausible dialog in which a Russian submarine ace conveniently explains the workings of a modern nuke-sub read like a chapter from \\"nucular-sumbarine wahfair fer dummies\\", and only highlight that Robinson has less of a feel for warships than their performance specs.  Nothing explains Shahood's immediate preference for the Barracuda over other contemporary Russian subs like the Akula or Oscar, and Robinson doesn't give enough nuance to the science of warships to explain Barracuda's special lethality (The real Barracuda has reportedly been laid up since being seriously damaged by colliding with the attack sub USS Baton Rouge in 1992, about 16 years before \\"Barracuda\\" occurs).  Credible? British forces accompanying Israeli commandos into Hebron?  A beautiful mideastern woman named \\"Shakira\\"?  Chinese who speak pidgin?  Islamic types who don't sound very Islamic as they do singularly anti-American?  Islamic terrorists who can get support anywhere they look in the Islamic world?  Plausibility?  <br />Robinson's writing is mostly mediocre, which only softens the impact of his true howlers: \\"It was a face of high intelligence\\"; \\"That Siberia's a bloody big place.  Gotta be the biggest place in the world\\"; Morgan's car speeds \\"like a meteor across the moon\\"; and my favorite, this paradoxical description of a missile attack \\"Never mind comparisons with an atomic bomb, they could very nearly have seen this in Hiroshima\\". <br />To top it off, Robinson replaces his immature political incorrectness with a more mature brand.  Instead of sobriquets \\"towelhead\\" or \\"chink\\" heard throughout \\"Shark Mutiny\\", Robinson unleashes a more understated and quaint brand of ethnic cleansing in which Muslims are utterly alien to the ethnically homogenous west.  Kerman's Islamic past is kept secret until he joins Hamas.  Once revealed, Kerman's origins shock British and American leaders who, despite sizable Muslim populations throughout their countries, are mystified that a Muslim might actually have made his way into their top echelons.  Robinson's political bent is also laughable, targeting liberals who gave the Panama canal away to a red-Chinese controlled conglomerate, made GPS more useful to terrorists, and kept us hooked on foreign oil by blocking oil-drilling in Alaska for environmental reasons.  I could accept Robinson's conspiracy theory linking the PRC to the Panama Canal if the Chinese actually did anything more than act as middlemen for Kerman.  In contrast, his Americans seem much more ambitious when Morgan and crew gleefully strong-arm the President into sabotaging the Panama Canal as part of a plan to re-claim it for America.  I'm Yankee, but couldn't help feeling disturbed by the image of US gunships orbiting the Panamanian capital to ensure Panama's president signs a treaty ratifying the turnover.  Though Robinson obviously hates Clinton, his Republicanpresident looks like a clueless puppet, easily swayed to sign anything Morgan and crew leave on his desk (It's like \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" in the Oval Office - \\"Hey Beave - let me borrow the 82nd Airborne this week\\").  Robinson refers to Clinton as the current President's predecessor, even though \\"Barracuda\\" takes place 8 years after Clinton left office.  With its horrible writing, unbelievable characters and nonexistent \\"realism\\", this \\"Barracuda\\" should sleep with the fishies.	2003-08-25
US	49374774	R18H9F12OY9ASJ	0804110697	632286391	Apache Sunrise	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Great story - just not told that well	I can't really call this the great narrative of gunship flying that other reviewers have because it's the only one on the subject that I've gotten around to.  Still, I found the book a mixed bag.  Boyle joined the army after losing his job as an LA policeman.  Though somewhat older than other recruits, Boyle manages to achieve a slot in Army aviation, and from there, to gunships - sleek rotary-winged hunter killers that Boyle believes are to Vietnam what the Mustang was in WWII.  The Bell Cobra gunship - placing a two-man crew in tandem on the chassis of the Huey helicopter - was likely considered an interim measure to serve the needs of the military until a more dedicated machine became available.  When the Army cancelled the Cheyenne gunship, a new process began which ultimately produced the Apache.  Nevertheless, crews in VN made the most of their Cobras.)  Landing in VN, Boyle has to work his way up from the dreaded FNG status to combat vet in a short time.  In war, this has as much to do with learning to fly helicopters (and how to land battle-damaged ships in controlled crashes called autorotations) as it does with learning not to pick fights with enemy flack guns.  Boyle spends most of the book as an \\"X-Ray\\" - the front-seat gunner - occasionally being given the controls to prove his worth as a pilot.  <br />Though I seldom got a sense of what it was like to fly helicopters or the Cobra (a flaw endemic to all military aviation memoirs, even though they are roundly praised for putting their readers in the pilot seat), Boyle manages to keep the story fixed to the flying itself.  Boyle also avoids much of the politics of the war, though individual reader preference will decided the merits of that (\\"a soldier's duty should rise above politics\\" vs. \\"who are we kidding?  It was a political war\\").  Also, the book seems incomplete - Boyle end off while he's still in-country.  My guess is that \\"Sunrise\\" is meant to climax with his transition to A/C (the back-seat), but the story doesn't really map that out.  Boyle seems like the soft-spoken can-do guy - sort like William Anderson in \\"To Fly and Fight\\" -  though it's hard to imagine that in Vietnam.  If \\"Sunrise\\" has a more decided fault, it's Boyle's determination to get everybody's story, which reduces the book to worst kind of military memoir: the bag of anecdotes.  That's very democratic, but in the end we only get pieces of stories that don't add up to much, rather than one story that tells all.  Doubtlessly, anybody who served in choppers will appreciate \\"Sunrise\\" because they already know stories like these first-hand, and need know details to flesh things out. Because I haven't served, I'm at a disadvantage, and came away from \\"Sunrise\\" wondering just how Boyle managed to do so much, yet tell so little.  Still, Boy;e's perspective is hard to ignore, and I'll probably be the first to get the follow-up he hints at at the end of &quot;Apache Sunrise&quot;.	2003-08-21

It's a novel, but we're supposed to rely on it as a realistic story of the air war in Vietnam.  Beginning with the arrival in-country of Jan VanVorden (quickly dubbed the Dutchman - to this day, I'm not sure if the author's use of that ominous name was all that intentional), \\"Huey\\" has VanVorden become one of his unit's most proficient and respected fliers.  As a warrant officer, the Dutchman straddles the line between enlisted grunts and officers.  Most of the book is episodic, tracing the year-long tour VanVorden must endure in Vietnam.  Between suffering the incompetence of his superiors and the skill of the Vietcong, survival becomes nearly impossible (the story is told in flashback after the Dutchman is severely injured in battle).  Some stereotypes seem hard to accept (chief being an army officer, the hero's superior, who seems to be as snobbish as some civil-war academy grad), and the story gets too gooey sentimental at times - but hey, it's a novel.  The plot meanders around - clashes with superiors, partying with fellow chopper-drivers on leave, braving the Viet Cong and mastering the Huey - but that only makes the story more -re-readable.  My chief problem was that the book clearly respects the Dutchman as a brave and proficient driver, then ignores how VanVorden became the master chopper driver (and why so many others were not as lucky).  Also, the author seems to have had many noteworthy experiences in Vietnam himself - or at least had access to those of others.  The story of chopper pilots in Viet Nam is a compelling one - why must it be fictionalized?	2003-08-21
US	49374774	R18YLETXZ8PX7G	0060086629	603736518	Barracuda 945 (Robinson, Patrick)	Books	1	4	4	N	N	surely, you can't be serious	An ex-SAS commando, skilled at unarmed combat, leads mideastern terrorists to strike America with cruise-missiles.  Ray Kerman joins British special forces, barely aware of his Islamic past - his parents emigrated from Iran and blended into British society.  On assignment to monitor Israeli Forces inside embattled Hebron, Kerman meets a beautiful Palestinian during an IDF-Hamas battle - and faster than you can say \\"you-wouldn't-like-me-when-I'm-angry\\" - Kerman joins Hamas.  Now called Ravi Rashood, he eventually arrives in Iran, where he convinces some mullah's to buy 2 \\"Barracudas\\" - Russian Sierra class nuclear subs that haven't been used in about two decades.  Armed with cruise missiles, one of the subs will sneak up our Pacific coast and blast American petro facilities and other targets of opportunity.  On the home front, Admiral Arnold Morgan, the National Security Advisor, and Lt. Cdr. Jimmy Ramshawe, an intelligence officer, piece together the clues linking Kerman, Hamas and the mysterious sale of the twin Barracudas.<br />\\"Barracuda\\", the worst book I've read since \\"Shark Mutiny\\", is even worse than Publisher's Weekly warned - full of meaningless digressions so mind-bogglingly irrelevant, they don't even rise to pedantry and must be read to be believed. The Barracuda plan doesn't even materialize until nearly half-way through \\"Barracuda\\".  Until then, Robinson tells the story of Kerman/Rashood - his upbringing, his training and his improbable conversion to rogue warrior.  The \\"ops\\" he commits earlier in the book are supposed to lead to Rashood's missile-sub plan, but that idea sounds like something Rashood's Iranian backers could've thought up.  (Nothing in Kerman's SAS background suggests how he alone dreamt up the plan).  The earlier ops themselves are meant to be spectacular (including a daring breakout from an Israeli max-sec prison housing hardcore terrorists) but suffer from Robinson's inability to form a reasonable POV and otherwise inept story-telling, and in any event, never connect with the plot to lob cruise missiles at the US.  <br />Instead, Robinson seems to forget what \\"Barracuda\\" is about - while Rashood travels to Iran, we learn of an Iranian missile boat, a Chinese cruise missile, and that the missile's engine was built in Toulouse, even though neither the missile nor the boat will figure in the action; the science of driving and hunting submarines is barely touched on, but you can count on Robinson's chillingly plausible depiction of a breakfast menu; Robinson will often introduce a large cast of characters - reciting their names and positions - but otherwise has them doing nothing.  Robinson must think that I'm one of the only techno-thriller fans who believes that accurate technical details should be used to further the plot, and not the author's rep for knowing anything.  His fans supposedly overlook stylistic flaws in favor of purportedly explosive plots and plausibly accurate details.

British forces accompanying Israeli commandos into Hebron?  A beautiful Palestinian named \\"Shakira\\"?  Chinese who sound like crude stereotypes of take-out deliverymen?

(Robinson refers to Clinton as the current President's predecessor, even though \\"Barracuda takes place 8 years after Clinton left office.)  I could accept Robinson's theory linking the PRC to the Panama Canal except for one thing: nothing in \\"Barracuda\\" makes his Chinese seem as ominous as his Americans - when Adm. Morgan and crew gleefully strongarm the President into sabotaging the Panama Canal as part of a plan to re-claim it for America (complete with gunships orbiting the capital to ensure Panama's president signs a treaty ratifying the move) you've got to wonder what the Chinese had in store (other than simply becoming another super-power that won't live within its means) that makes their comeuppance seem deserved.

A detective comes here to investigate the mysterious death of a young woman by forces unknown.  He gets little help from the town, as if the inhabitants of the cove were not only protecting something, but had become the something itself.<br />Unfortunately, Koontz is better at creating the idea than executing it, and he doesn't let his story get far before he just tosses mystery aside and has two of his characters explain exactly what's going on.  Without explaining too much (since Koontz saves us all the trouble) the Cove has become a rather freaky laboratory run, with the tacit agreement of the town, by a local genius who's certifiable in equal parts genius and the psychotic.  The experiment uses nano-computers to tap into the latent minds of all humans, all centered around a huge computer that both manages it and provides a safety device (for the inventor, that is; he can shut everything down if he wants or feels its necessary.  Of course, that will also annihilate the town).  Faster than you can say \\"monsters from the id!\\", the secret is out, and it's downhill from there.  The way the secret is revealed is an enormous cheat - our hero is a detective!  Couldn't Koontz work up a plot that has the detective being forced to learn enough about bio-mechanics so that he could at least solve some of the mystery?  Instead, as the clock ticks to midnight, our heroes spend much of their time dodging the rapidly revealed menace.  Also, the conversation in which the secret is revealed is impossible: with the reclusive genius and the sheriff having a completely gratuitous conversation - it's almost like me overhearing a conversation between Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, in English!  Even the manner in which the monsters appear is utterly fake.  Koontz telegraphs his chills so that they have no edge by the time they climax.  His descriptions of the monsters doesn't mount to much either - since they all pretty much have the same menace, it doesn't matter that some look like Frankenstein's monster, while others resemble werewolves.  When a monster intended to resemble the creature from the \\"Alien\\" movies is described pretty much in those terms, I was ready to toss this book without waiting for midnight.oontz telegraphs his chills so that they have no edge by the time they climax.

Though much of \\"Black Aces\\" (the title refers to VF-41's nickname) tells the same legends of naval aviation that I've read since about 1987, it does cover an important moment in the history of the F-14.  Though the plane is on its way out (the Navy has already begun phasing out the earliest models, with the plane to completely exit operations by 2010), F-14's were given a late-in-life new mission of ground attack, probably meant to fill the gap between the already phased out A-6 Intruder and the not-yet-ready for primetime F/A-18E/F \\"Super Hornet\\".  Equipped with laser and infra-red sensors, and armed with laser-glide bombs, Tomcat crews - pilots and radar-intercept officers - scour the hilly, forested terrain of the former Yugoslavia for Serb forces.  Flying from the USS Roosevelt, Tomcats pass the mouth of the Adriatic (off the \\"heel\\" of Italy) and into Kosovo.  Unfortunately, not fighting a true war, Serb forces don't attack or hide out in the open before they sweep into Kosovar-Albanian enclaves, forcing the American fliers to rely on their sensors and no-small degree of detective work to locate the enemy.  For Tomcat crews, their eventual success is bittersweet: their ability adapting Tomcats to strike roles (for decades, the F-14 was a dedicated interceptor, more singular in that role than F-16 or F-15 fighters that were equipped with ground attack weapons) will do less to earn the aging fighter a reprieve than validate and pave the way for the plane that will replace it.  Wilcox doesn't hint much at the \\"Supre Hornet\\" and doesn't begin to approach the controversy that the F-14 v. F/A-18E debate has reportedly ignited among naval aviation professionals.  (On the last page, Wilcox mentions Super Hornet in glowing words - it's the plane of the future.)  <br />In telling his story, Wilcox follows theplanes and pilots of VF-41 - from the \\"Hinges\\" (senior pilots) to the \\"Nuggets\\" (untested and sometimes not quite proficient new guys).  Wilcox reveals the pressures that nearly crush the senior pilots - who must battle the poor weather and the F-14's poor serviceability as much the enemy.  He also reveals the faults (and strengths) of the nuggets - at least one of whom appear to be using regulations as an excuse for their less-than-aggressive flying.  Wilcox gets very close to his pilots - quoting them almost word for word.  You get a sense, as he recalls individual statements - that<BR>there's more going on then even he understands, even if he gets enough to encapsulate some thoughts in brackets.  The writing is also embarassingly bad in spots - with Wilcox often summarizing a paragraph or completing a thought with a single-sentence paragraph that makes the book sound less like a history of war than a first-grade reader.  Organization could also have been improved - Wilcox starts describing the faults and strengths of a Nugget - only to tangent into another pilot before giving closure to the initial assessment of the first. We also learn fairly late in the story that one of the F-14 pilots had transitioned from the A-6, the vintage carrier-strike jet whose role the F-14 was now trying to fill.  You'd think that pilot's experience would have made him a prominent member of the squadron - but not to Wilcox.<br />\\"Aces\\" has the feeling of a rush job.  Wilcox accompanied the Roosevelt doubtlessly knowing as much as the rest of us that the 9/11 attacks would reduce the Kosovo war to a blip on the minds of many Americans.  He reminds us that the F-14 can be a trying plane or that landing on aircraft carriers at night or in poor weather can be an ordeal rivaling combat, but he doesn't take us inside the minds of those pilots.  Wilcox likely thought that he had already done as much to humanize his pilots by showing them lose their temper, miss targets, get chewed out by superiors or by displaying questionably unagressive tendancies for a fighter pilot - and had to \\"balance\\" things to stay in the Navy's good graces.  The result is that we a get a sense that it's a challenge to fly the F-14, but not<BR>why.	2003-08-03
US	49374774	RCRY3HK5N6NQT	1840371129	580152927	Fundamentals of Fighter Design	Books	4	9	9	N	N	The history and science of designing fighter aircraft	\\"Fundamentals of Fighter Design\\" is one of two books written by aerodynamicist Ray Whitford that survey the anatomy of fighter aircraft.  As in his older book \\"Design for Air Combat\\", Whitford breaks down the various areas that make up an airplane - the aerodynamics, power plants, avionics, weapons and weapons systems and control systems.  (Not being an aerodynamics expert by profession or training, I have yet to complete the denser \\"Design\\" and probably will never be able to, though I find that book also a masterful survey, worth at least trying to wade through as a companion to this one.)  Unlike that older book, \\"Fundamentals\\" goes to great lengths to be approachable to non-experts, though this has mixed results.  Whitford tries to keep from getting bogged down in the real fundamentals of his science, but that just means that non-experts will be left clueless at some points.  Though very technical, Mr. Whitford goes to great lengths in this book to explain the aerodynamic, mechanical or other underlying principles he discusses.  Also, unlike \\"Design\\", \\"Fundamentals\\" provides more historical discussion about various aspects of technology (why was the centrifugal-flow turbojet so popular in the early post-WWII years? What allowed the axial-flow to emerge triumphant in the end? And why were navies so reluctant to jump on the jet bandwagon at all?).  Whitford's prose, though quite technical, are refreshingly aimed at non-experts, but obviously, there's just so much about the science that you can cram into a single book while still making it accessible to anybody who doesn't work for  Lockheed-Martin, BAe or MiG MAPO.  Whitford backs up his \\"lessons\\" with photos and diagrams (strangely, while I'd guess that it's harder to get an F-14 to pose for you in a way that captures its variable-sweep wings responding to changing mach number, the photos sometimes do a better job telling the story than the diagrams).  <br />\\"Fundamentals\\", being a newer book, takes some advantageof newer developments in military aviation.  \\"Design\\" was published around 1989, about a year after the USAF publicly unveiled the F-117 and B-2, while the aircraft that would emerge as contestants in the ATF war were still only known by their \\"conceptual\\" drawings (later revealed to have little resemblance to the actual planes).  \\"Desert Storm\\" and the rise and fall of the A-12 were still in the future - the Iraquis were our friends, the Russians were not.  Consequently, there's a whole chapter on stealth, while the Su-27's famous \\"Cobra\\" maneuver gets a spotlight, plus pictures of Eurofighter, the Rafale and the F/A-18E/F that weren't available for the older book.  One wonders whether Whitford might try again at breaking down the science of military flight - this time using the development of Eurofighter Typhoon to provide the context (going from the Sopwith Pup, to the Spitfire, to the Meteor, Vampire, Hunter, Lightning, Tornado to the Typhoon).<br />You won't understand a lot of it, maybe even most, (and even experts won't be able to head off to their workbench ready to bang together their own homemade ATF), but what comes clear is still worth the cover price and exceeds anything you'll see on \\"Discovery: Wings\\".	2003-07-24
US	49374774	RD1DPWWJ8EG7Y	031218087X	201960968	Digital Fortress	Books	1	6	11	N	N	Unitelligent and Uninspired - no thrills in this Fortress	\\"Digital Fortress\\" hints at being a thinking man's technothriller - using codes and human intuition instead of fighter jets and nu-cue-ler subs.  Instead, it's full of implausible characters and uninspired plot twists, always seeming sure that it's much smarter than it really is.<br />THE PLOT:  a now dead computer programmer has created a seemingly unbreakable code, the eponymous \\"Digital Fortress\\", setting off a fierce hunt for its code key. While the key to DF is distributed on the internet, it's buried within the code itself.  Whoever unlocks the code will have access to the ultimate protection against decryption. Hostile governments, organized criminals or terrorists will be able to communicate freely over the internet completely immune to detection.  Fearing this, the NSA - the US agency responsible for gathering signals information and cracking codes - sends free-lance genius Dave Becker to Seville, where the programmer died. Trevor Strathmore, the NSA's head code breaker hopes that DF's creator left some clue to the code key behind.  Unfortunately, Becker isn't alone on his hunt...<br />Meanwhile, back at the NSA's high-tech HQ, Susan Fletcher, our hero's brilliant and sexy NSA genius of a girlfriend - tries picking up the mystery from her end of the Atlantic, where Strathmore's newest supercomputer is busy melting itself down trying to crack DF. Unfortunately, it looks like somebody is on Susan's trail as well - from the inside - and we get the hint that she shouldn't feel as safe as she does when Strathmore is around.  Back in Seville, Becker quickly learns that DF's creator had worn a ring when he died - but it's missing.  Quickly guessing that inscriptions on the ring say more than \\"one ring to rule them all\\", our hero tracks it across Spain, learning how quickly it moves from owner to owner.  Unfortunately, whoever owns the ring (even briefly) is marked for death by a mysterious assassin - a deaf killer who never misses, and catalogs his kills on a PalmPilot.<br />HOWEVER: I can't believe that this novel is as popular as reviewers make it sound. It's not only strikingly unintelligent, but strikingly arch.  Brown learned more about cryptography and the NSA than most people cared to hear about, and thus crafted a novel based on his \\"insider\\" info about cryptography.  (Brown's story heavily relies on a perceived ignorance of what the NSA stands for - an agency, he writes, that only a small percentage of Americans understand.  Rather than showing that Brown is a writer who has learnt what most us can't, \\"Digital Fortress\\" proves that Brown focuses on remote subjects not likely to have a large number of experts who can effectively challenge his pretensions of realism.  Actually, I learned more about cryptography while writing a paper about the Walker Family Spy Ring in high school, and most will probably learn more about the NSA watching \\"Sneakers\\" or \\"Good Will Hunting\\".  How do you like them apples?)  Instead of intelligent clues, Brown's story builds on arcane trivia (the etymology of the word \\"sincere\\", certain technical details distinguishing the different a-bombs used against Japan).  I was able to piece together some of Brown's clues, not because I'm smarter than most, but simply because I watch a lot of the History channel.<br />Getting past the \\"thrill\\" and \\"techno\\" aspects of the story, what's left is thin - Brown's ring-plot provides an excuse to send our hero across Seville, hunting the ring, making this less of a novel of any genre than a college-writing version of \\"Where I Went Last Summer\\" (complete with Spanish dialog repeated in English).<br />Brown's thin story is plumped, not with some redeeming characters of depth and intelligent plot turns, but with unbelievably stupid characters and unbelievable plot twists. Our hero is no action hero (he stays in shape playing racquetball), yet he manages to elude the hitman who has carved a path of precision-guided death across Seville.  Susan is beautiful andbrilliant - though Brown never leaves us doubting as to which half matters more (Susan is probably the least independent, most vulnerable, unintelligent and otherwise dated female character I've seen in any technothriller; even her smarts are just a convenient device to explain why she's working with the NSA.)  Strathmore is supposed to be a cryptographer par excellence, yet he defies belief - he's so obsessed with DF that he rams it into his super-codebreaking computer, bypassing security checks meant to protect it from viruses.  He does this despite knowing that DF is obviously more than it appears (its code for heaven's sake!!).  There's another NSA co-worker, a guy who's supposed to set off our alarm bells, but it's obvious that Brown only means him to distract us from Strathmore since Brown couldn't be bothered to come up with more characters.  Like Strathmore, the rest of the denizens of NSA headquarters are so dim, it's inconceivable that they'd be trusted to run a third rate ISP, let alone the most sophisticated code-breaking computer in the world.  (Typical for low-grade technothrillers, Brown is so obsessed credentialing his characters as geniuses, he devotes little time to writing them even slightly smart.)<br />By the climax, I couldn't care whether the NSA would be destroyed by the killer code, mostly because the author had by then changed from telling a story to giving a pitch for some splashy action movie, making the novel's Hollywood aspirations annoyingly clear. In short, storm some other fortress.	2003-07-20

Until I read \\"Blind\\", my perception of military subs has been one of deterrence - training for a never green-lighted nuclear mission. Even subs not armed with city-smashing ICBM's were purpose-built for WWIII: whether those armed with crude cruise-missiles that preceded the age of ICBM armed subs, or when newer attack submarines subs took to sea, to hunt down Soviet subs armed to the teeth with missiles. Sontag &amp; Drew tell a tale of a undersea warfare that was anything but stalled by mutual deterrence, detailing the submarine as an active agent of espionage. From the end of WWII until today, subs relied on ever evolving technologies to allow them to silently enter the coastal redoubts of the Soviet Union and gather intelligence.  Between the tenacity of their crews and the somewhat trouble-prone technology available, our subs tapped into \\"secure\\" Soviet communications lines, located the wreck of a Red Navy missile sub that sank (under mysterious circumstances) in the Pacific in 1968, and generally tailed and catalogued every soviet sub they could find.  Tailing Russian subs proves to be the true challenge.  Under water, submarines are located and tracked using sound - whether by the sounds they emit, or by being echo-ranged by a hunter.  Every \\"class\\" of subs (a class refers to a generation of a kind of submarine, like a new class of missile-carrying sub, or hunter-killer sub) proves to have its own distinct \\"signature\\" - a sort of sonar fingerprint (sounds contributing to this fingerprint include emissions related to propeller movement and - in the case of nukes - the steam plants and pump machinery of their reactors).  Thus, finding a hitherto unknown class of sub, getting close enough to establish its signature, and tailingit long enough to verify the signature are critical if fellow submariners are to be able to intercept the enemy in war situations.  Drew and Sontag chillingly tell of both the pressure to locate and classify new soviet subs, and the hazards involved.  Far from an exact science, the ambiguities of undersea navigation and the unpredictable affects that the oceans have on sonar equipment combined with the unpredictable behavior of Russian crews enhances the hazards of this cat-and-mouse game, leading to frequent collisions.  Because all subs suffer a blind spot behind them, Submarine commanders frequently make abrupt course reversals - swapping stern for bow - never knowing if a pursuer is too close behind to compensate.  (\\"Bluff\\" details a 1980's collision between a Soviet cruise-missile carrier and the USS Tautog, one that the Americans initially thought fatal to the Russians; the Russians blamed the Americans for the 1968 sinking of their missile sub in the Pacific, likely believing that a collision occurred.) <br />Unfortunately, this history of an intelligence war that lasted for about half-a-century seems incomplete.   &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot; actually groups together many stories - some probably deserving their own book - in a sort of \\"Right Stuff\\" narrative that lacks a central theme.  In \\"Stuff\\", it was the race to beat the Russians to the Moon.  Though that book stopped short of the lunar landings, Wolfe made his point once his astronauts and scientists matured enough to make the moonshots an inevitable American triumph.  Unlike the history of spaceflight, dominate by historical moments that connect America to the moon, the obvious milestones of submarine technology (nuclear power and the torpedo-shaped submarine hull) fall midway, while other historic points (loss and discovery of the attack sub USS Scorpion and the CIA's semi-successful efforts to raise a sunken Russian sub) seem anti-climactic and disconnected. Between these historic points, there are many good stories (some I've never heard of, others I have, but seem better treated here) that remain insufficiently connected by a well-defined theme or by historically recurring characters as Wolfe had in &quot;Stuff&quot;. Figures like Sergey Gorshkov (The Soviet Navy's widely acknowledged architect), Hyman Rickover (the so-called &quot;Father of the Nuclear Navy&quot;) and John Craven recur throughout the book, but the author's don't account for how these men or others shaped the mission of today's navy. Instead, the details and people of the stories recounted in &quot;Bluff&quot; seem to go little farther than their own stories.  We learn the history of the troubled Mk 37 Torpedo only as a possible explanation for the Scorpion disaster. Similarly, the hurried and incomplete planning that sent Scorpion to sea when it needed overhaul - exacerbating unsafe conditions thought endemic only to Russian subs - are unconnected to historic trends showing improved or decreased reliance on equipment, training, morale or logistics. Most glaring of all, the story seems to exclude the Russian side, except to confirm a few facts that Americans didn't know. While &quot;Bluff&quot; seems to tell the story of submarine espionage, it's not clear if the Americans were unique in using subs for spying or if the Soviets, who had the biggest nuclear powered fleet in the world, are still holding their secrets. Sontag and Drew hint at the offensive strategies of the Red Navy but never rule out whether Russian subs tried to match the USN in espionage.  We know that the Soviets relied on the Walkers and turncoats like Aldrich Ames, but have not learned how.  Also, the illegal technology transfers by Toshiba and Konigsberg get little shrift here.  Sontag and Drew make sub-hunting such an impossible chore, that you begin to wonder whether the Russians were bridging the gap in sub-technology as reported in the late 1980's, or whether such advances were historically typical.  While America is the acknowledged cold-war victor, if Russian submarine history is as truly opaque as &quot;Bluff&quot; allows, then it is the Russians who merit the accolades. As in WWII, the ultimate measure of success in submarine warfare is silence.	2003-07-18

The Rotten Report knows better - topical novels are less cutting-edge than cut-and-paste of existing news stories. The result is less realistic than apparently realistic, which is just realistic enough to convince readers that a slim understanding of aviation will back up the slim plot.<br />\\"Airframe\\" centers on a fictitious airliner - the Norton N-22, a marvel of efficiency and safety. Popular opinion shifts when an N-22 encounters severe turbulence - killing three and injuring scores more. The media - as opposed to their practice in more recent disasters - blame Norton rather than the airlines (remember the hype over low-cost outfits like \\"ValueJet\\" and bloated dinosaurs like Pan-Am and TWA, and remember all of those \\"US-scare\\" jokes?), turning Norton into a target for ambitious reporters, \\"bottom-feeding\\" lawyers and other unethical, uninformed and non-credentialed \\"experts\\". \\"Airframe\\" could have been a great novel with which to explore issues like products liability, airlines and the media, but Crichton proves as prone as his media villains to unconvincingly sexing up the story.  The N-22 becomes beset by every conceivable unethical character in America, sharing nothing more in common than greed and ignorance.  Norton's Aero experts are his heroes, selflessly protecting aviation from the Knights of the Round Tort.<br />Using a fictitious story that makes no secret of its sympathies, Crichton rails against the media's uninformed depictions of the aviation industry, citing the history of the DC-10' - which was temporarily grounded following a string of accidents and bad press in the 1970's - as an example. Though DC-10s returned to fly, Crichton insists that McDonnell never sold another.  I lived near an airport until '98 and routinely saw DC-10's in flight until they were phased out recently - nearly two decades after their \\"grounding\\" and about the same time as its competitor, the L-1011, a plane the DC-10 outsold. I even flew a DC-10 on a major airline in 1994 - I can't remember when I last flew an L-1011. (The DC-10 was more likely a victim - if at all - of airline deregulation, which created many airlines flying short routes with small planes like the 737, now one of commercial aviation's most popular jets; Strangely Crichton never explains how maligned MacDonnell managed to weather the DC-10 crisis enough to continue selling other planes and even try their hand at the MD-11, a next-generation jumbo jet.)  Crichton sticks to his version of the DC-10 story so uncritically, it's almost impossible to take at face value. \\"Airframe\\" begins with a quote by a veteran journalist who warns against giving respectability to the uninformed, which does less to make Crichton's points than seize the moral high-ground of debate. Certainly \\"Airframe\\"'s details don't betray any more knowledge of aviation than any other layman who subscribes to \\"Aviation Week\\".<br />Like a poorly designed aircraft, \\"Airframe\\" never gets off the ground - Crichton quickly lets you know that he's less interested in aviation than the media's sway over America...on any subject. In fact, \\"Airframe\\" is so removed from actually flying planes, that it could have been written about anything - choose your widget, and you've got a book.  \\"Airframe\\" might as well have originated as a novel about mopeds or cars until TWA 800 or ValueJet made it a more marketable to add chapters and use find/replace to swap small, wheeled vehicles for jets. The heroes of \\"Airframe\\" - experts involved in designing and building airplanes - are almost as removed from flying as the villains. Though he pays lip-service to the wisdom of  pilots (check that other quote before the first page) Crichton either won't or can't make a pilot one of his main characters, and Crichton's aero-engineers - N-22 partisans who know airplanes - are kept around only to add the veneer of scientific correctness to his screed against the uninformed media. This is not Craig Thomas' \\"A Different War\\", where the hero redeems the suspected airliner by flying it. The flight in one simple chapter of that book is enough to banish any hint of mopeds. Crichton's holds airliners in a perspective no different from that of the dim laymen he populates his books with - as vehicles.  Alas again that the plot heaps scorn on the media even though corporate espionage has more to do with Norton's problems. Despite often using \\"corporate\\" as synonymous with \\"sinister\\", \\"Airframe\\" is at best a flaccid indictment against corporations, let alone the media.<br />Knowing he lacks enough plot to remind readers (and perhaps himself) that \\"Airframe\\" is about something exotic and beyond his grasp, Crichton falls back on his usual suspects - corporate intrigue, as if he can keep things going with a dash of \\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"Disclosure\\". When the plucky heroine, a Norton exec, wants to clear the N-22, she's saddled with an unwanted intern (and likely a corporate spy) named Bob Richman. As far as Crichton is concerned, Richman is dead-meat the minute he appears: if his blue-chip upbringing, top-flight education, and high-priced (and foreign! ) car aren't enough warning, his youth makes Richman enemy number-one (not that he does anything apparently evil, but Crichton's villains are seldom as evil as ambitioned, arrogant or just unlikable). At first, I expected a surprise - make a hero out of the sleazy ivy-leaguer and confound readers primed for the Richman's fall. Instead, \\"Airframe\\" remains boldly unsurprising (the brat's name is the perfect example - I guess \\"Richboy\\" would have been too obvious), and there isn't a thrill to be had. Throw in a \\"twist\\" ending that's blatantly lifted from a true incident that the media responsibly reported, and you've got a book that deserves to be grounded - for good. If you've got to read Crichton, read the first Jurassic, the Andromeda Strain or Sphere. If you've got to read about flying, pick up Coonts or Craig Thomas.eer of scientific correctness to his screed against the uninformed media.

US	49374774	R31VTOVHQ8R8RI	0312874405	811349338	Red Moon	Books	3	1	1	N	N	dissappointing but above average historical fiction	\\"Red Moon\\", a novel, tells of the Soviets' ill-fated attempts to beat the Yanks to the moon.  Author Michael Cassutt obviously knows something about the \\"secret history\\" of soviet spaceflight - which hailed its own triumphs while covering up some spectacular failures - but nevertheless tries to frame his story in his hero's personal narrative.  We first \\"meet\\" Yuri Ribko in 1998, as he's interviewed by a western aerospace journalist.  The space race is over by then: Russians and Yanks collaborate over the ISS space station that neither can begin to complete alone, and anyway, the Clinton impeachment was the headline of the day.  The once-mighty Russian spaceflight infrastructure is a shell of its former self - the nation that pioneered satellites and manned spaceflight can barely afford to complete crucial components for ISS, while the beloved Mir space station faces abandonment (it would re-enter and burn up in the spring of 2001).  <br />In his interviews, Ribko takes us back to the mid 1960's when, as an engineer, he joins the Korolev design bureau - one of several bureaus competing for glamorous projects like the moon shot.  His timing is fateful - Sergei Korolev (acknowledged years after his death as the genius behind the rockets that orbited the first satellites and then the first cosmonauts) dies in what appears to be a botched operation, and a succession war breaks out to replace him.  For those who run the various design bureaus, life is very much a class-war - against various would-be usurpers, other bureaus and the military, with the party and the KGB making everybody's life miserable.  Ribko is the son of a veteran combat-pilot, now \\"Colonel-General\\", a position he seems too noble to exploit.  Unfortunately, he's also the nephew of a KGB bigwig - A. Vlad \\"Uncle Vladimir\\" Nefudov - which puts him in a position he can't refuse: investigate the \\"suspicious\\" death of Korolev and a string of \\"mysterious\\" failures that plague the Soviet space program.  Implausibly game, Ribko eagerly accepts, which turns out to be a serious mistake - even he realizes that he's no great detective, and his efforts lag even as the KGB's leash marks him as an informer.  As Ribko's \\"career\\" progresses, he witnesses further soviet failures that widen America's lead in the lunar race - Vladimir Komarov is killed flying Soyuz-1, while Gagarin is lost when his MiG-15 crashes.  Closer to \\"home\\" Ribko's colleagues face purges or KGB arrests, while his father goes off to supress the Czech velvet uprising.  For a moment, an American catastrophe - the fiery deaths of Grissom, White and Chafee during a test of Apollo-1 - allows the Soviets a moment of hope, only to be dashed when the Soyuz-1 disaster sets their timetable to \\"man rate\\" their moonship back by months.<br />\\"Red Moon\\" is more absorbing than it has a right to be - mostly because it's seldom more than a fictional, first-person narrative of Russia's failed lunar program.  The possibilities of a story that's based on Russian spaceflight seldom here go beyond historical moments (like Soyuz-1).  Cassutt knows much about that history, and relating it through Yuri gives the story a personal feel that goes beyond your standard \\"historical fiction\\".  He goes little further than that, however, delving into historical and technical details you're only likely to know or care about if you know or care about spaceflight.  But that only raises the familiar paradox for readers of genre books - you've got to already be interested in that kind of story to want to pick up a book like \\"Red Moon\\", but if you are, you're least likely to be surprised.  Other subplots - hunting the saboteur/murderer; Yuri's complicated relationship with his father; and a complicated pair of interlocking love triangles (Yuri is split between Marina, who loves him, and Katya, who works for Uncle Vladimir; Marina alternates between Uri and Lev, one of Yuri's fellow engineers) - never develop nor really interlock.  The most glaring ofthe half-baked subplots is the saboteur - though it's the first Cassutt begins to develop, he never gives Yuri (an educated guy) the intellectual tools to actually attack the mystery.  Just when the novel begins to look like an intriguing mix of \\"The Right Stuff\\" and \\"Gorky Park\\", Cassutt drops Yuri back into one of the other (and lesser) subplots (into an argument with his father; an intimidating meeting with Uncle Vlad; to bed with Katya).  Making half-hearted stabs at the mystery, Yuri sorts out various suspects based on motive (who would want to kill the father of Soviet spaceflight, and the first cosmonaut?), but few other details (like opportunity), and his crime-solving look like an installment of \\"The Mole\\".  Strangely, though the Americans are constant in the minds of those enmeshed in soviet spaceflight, the prospect of phantom CIA spies never crosses anybody's mind.  Even the historical detail sometimes feels forced - the catastrophic launchpad explosion that killed Marshal Nedelin and about 100 others in 1961 is dropped in just to remind us how much Cassutt knows about spaceflight, but little else. (How Yuri would know about an incident that the Soviets kept under wraps for years is also inexplicable).  Cassutt wraps up his story too quickly, with a disastrous test launch of the soviet's lunar booster (a proton rocket mounted on a first stage containing 30 engines).  There's a story behind that failure, but Cassutt's explanation is forced, has nothing to do with any of the characters of the story, and doesn't even sound convincing.<br />It's obvious that Cassutt was writing his version of \\"Peter Nevsky and the True Story of the Russian Moon Landing\\" but slimmer, less intimidating and character-driven than that book, and one taking the more historically correct, if less tantalizing route.  Still an above novel which mirrors the soviets' endeavors in space in aiming higher than they could reach.	2003-07-08
US	49374774	R3PLBQ56EDVXMH	0374281602	721325086	Reversible Errors: A Novel	Books	4	4	7	N	N	No great Turow book, but a legal thriller w/real thrills	The imminent execution of a thief turned accused murderer provides an unlikely connection for the mismatched characters in \\"Reversible Errors\\".  Convicted for a triple homicide occuring on July 4, 1991, Rommy \\"Squirrel\\" Gandolph has one last chance to avoid the needle, a \\"Habeas Corpus\\" proceeding that will cast doubt on the conviction.  In an appellate trial 10 years later, Gandolph remains the perfect defendant - unlikable, not all there, but not incompetent enough to have gotten off on a \\"technicality\\".  His one hope: he was convicted in \\"Kindle County\\", the fictional land of Scott Turow novels, where nothing is what you expected it to be, where people are the sum of incomplete, failed lives, and their resentment causes them to act against the grain.  <br />If you've read \\"Presumed Innocent\\", \\"Burden of Proof\\" or \\"Pleading Guilty\\", you'll be both disappointed and also entertained by \\"Errors\\" which pulls enough of the magic of Turow's other books to set this one apart from the single-dimensional hole of standard \\"legal-thrillers\\", while reminding you how much better this story could have been.  True to form, Turow's cast of unfinished people are dissatisfied characters who become more defined and multi-dimensional the clearer their incompleteness becomes.  We meet Arthur Raven, Rommy's feckless appeals attorney; Gillian Sullivan, the judge who tried his case, recently released for serving time on bribery; Muriel Wynn, Rommy's prosecutor; and Larry Starczek, the detective who arrested him long after most fellow detectives gave up.  Turow wastes little time before telling us what's wrong with his characters - Raven is a successful corporate attorney prematurely enfeebled to middle-age by a life caring for his schizophrenic sister, and a failure at love.  Sullivan, a beautiful and accomplished prosecutor became a dope addict on the bench - a flaw hidden by her bribery conviction; Wynn and Starczek had been sleeping together in that fateful and steamy summer of 1991.Knowing that their relationship can't last, they pull out all the stops on Rommy's case, knowing that the trial will be the only thing keeping them together.  A decade later, when Raven forces them to revisit the case, they are married, but not to each other.  Having to look back at their younger selves only reminds the two of what could have been, which fuels the resentment that may ultimately save Rommy Gandolph, or speed him to his execution.  Our characters have so many gripes, you wonder whether the title \\"Reversible Errors\\" may say more about their lives than Gandolph's trial.<br />It's a story full of twists, and fun characters - one bound to make it a story you'll want to hang onto.  Still, it's not a great Turow story.  While a sweeping epic, Turow's work shines when creating high-drama in a compact story centered around a single character, like Mack Molloy in \\"Pleading Guilty\\" or Rusty Sabich in \\"Presumed Innocent\\".  Though Turow excels in finding uncommon depth in supporting characters, you always know who his star is, and you never stop caring where both the star and the story are going.  In \\"Errors\\", you're not sure who the story is about.  While opening with Raven, the story quickly relegates him to a critical but supporting role as Gandolph's attorney.  Turow tries to rehabilitate him halfway - introducing us to his mentally disturbed and disturbing sister, and having him fall in love with the wounded (former) judge Sullivan.  But neither he nor Sullivan have any connection to the case in 1991 - they've made no errors in that case that can now be reversed.  Instead, the story soon belongs to Starczek and Muriel, who go back to the original trial, desperately trying to find where they went wrong with the case and each other.  Once the story introduces us to the younger Muriel and Starczek, without doing the same for Gillian or Arthur, both Judge and attorney lose pace with detective and prosecutor, and never regain it.  That's a shame, since Arthur had the makings of a great Turow character - accomplished and resentful.  Also, the story begins by splitting the narrative between the investigation in 1991 and the present-day appeal, a form of prose-as-time travel which allows for some neat irony (we meet a possible murder witness in 1991 who, a chapter and decade later, is now imprisoned for a violent felony) that the book quickly junks by never repeating.  The story is also a mystery, but you're likely to keep asking yourself about a single piece of evidence which (surprise) becomes the linchpin of the entire case.<br />Nevertheless, this is on many levels a great story.  As a \\"Kindle County\\" story, Turow revisits many of the stories or legends of that famous non-existent town for his fans, like the dreaded \\"Night Saints\\" (a sinister gang turned guerilla army - we first learn of them in \\"Presumed Innocent\\", only to find that Starczek braved them as well), the noble Alejandro \\"Sandy\\" Stern (the courtly defense attorney of that first book and the hero of \\"Burden of Proof\\") and even Trans-National Airlines (the airline bilked out of millions in \\"Presumed Innocent\\").  Dan Lipranzer and Ray Horgan also have cameo appearances.  So do Tommy Molto and \\"Painless\\" Kumagai, the prosecutor and police pathologist who were disgraced at the end of \\"Presumed Innocent\\" yet seemed to have kept their jobs.  But above all, \\"Errors\\" is that rare legal thriller that does more than pay lip-service to the law - the characters here don't shy away from courtrooms and never fail to thrill.	2003-06-29
US	49374774	RIAUXW23QWUP0	0930289234	777411096	Watchmen	Books	4	5	10	N	N	Densely plotted wonder triumphs over its dated subject	This incredibly layered maxi-series (originally released monthly) caught on the new wave of pop-culture in which cultural icons were only fit to be destroyed.  For a generation of comics fans who couldn't stand to hear \\"truth, justice and the American way\\" one more time, \\"Watchmen\\" gave us the travails of two generations of costumed vigilantes long after they were broken by their experiences.  Among these is the Comedian, a smiling sadist whose calling card (the smiley button) becomes the series' icon.  Unlike most heroes forced into retirement by age, restrictive legislation and a society less tolerant of costumed white males, the Comedian goes to work for the police state.  The story begins with the Comedian's  mysterious murder (mysterious because his identity was supposedly secret), and examines its effects on the remaining heroes - most of whom are out of commission.  The Comedian's death provides both a mystery and a useful device for the surviving heroes to examine where their lives and their world went wrong.  (In the world of \\"Watchmen\\", advances in American technology allow for a world that can be safer and cleaner, but isn't; the advent of the superhero allows for a world that is safer and more respectful of the law, but doesn't; America's monopoly on superpower should make it more secure, instead, Nixon is still president when the novel begins, and the USSR and the US are set to go to war again).  Among the heroes is \\"Ozymandias\\", a genius who patterns himself after Alexander the Great; \\"Night-Owl\\" who relies on his own gadgetry and his knowledge of birds to fight crime; \\"Dr. Manhattan\\", a scientist altered by a nuclear experiment into a super-powered god for whom walls of time (and clothing) mean nothing; and darkest of all, Rorschach, a vigilante of few words whose mask conceals a reservoir fueled by violence.<br />Moore and Gibbons' story patterns these heroes on movie stars.  Promising in their youth, when crime is simple and most of the crooks wentbad simply to get in on the heroes' action, the first generation quickly turns to seed, and then turns on each other with their memoirs.  Life is hardly better for the arch-criminals, including an evil magician slowly dying of a cancer and loneliness.<br />\\"Watchmen\\" is a huge story - it was the story of the late 1980's (before the success of \\"Ninja Turtles\\" fueled a run on independent comics).  There was talk of a movie, and fans debated who should be cast.  In the end, it was for naught - the guys who scripted \\"Lord of the Rings\\" would have had their hands full trying to turn this complex story into a script.  \\"Watchmen\\" cuts across timelines to revisit many of the same moments again and again, creating multiple subplots that skew these moments in different ways (one key moment is the meeting between the Comedian and Lori Jupiter, the daughter of a former fellow hero.  We relive that instant both before and after learning of how the Comedian had raped Lori's mother).  \\"Watchmen\\" though dark, has a hidden bright side.  Because the past, present and future are all the same to Dr. Manhattan, he sees no point to trying to prevent an inevitable nuclear holocaust, yet even he is ultimately won over by the random miracles in which life is created and survived (there's got to be some reason why life manages to mature from a microscopic egg with everything going against it, and if we can't find out what that reason is, it's still worth protecting.)<br />Nowadays, it's fun to read because it's so obviously 1980's - its obsession with Vietnam (we didn't lose), Nixon, confrontation with the soviets and the end of western civilization make it less a story than a Time-Life infomercial.  Also, while revolutionary at the time, the deconstruction of heroes and heroism is hardly reason to be shocked today.  (The series debuted amid the \\"Iran-Contra\\" scandal, as well as after a surfeit of scandals among \\"televangelists\\", which eroded whatever popular trust in established figures Americans preserved after Watergate).  Ours is the generation of anti-heroes, Keyzer Soze, Clinton, Bush, Columbus and political correctness, Clint Eastwood in \\"Unforgiven\\" - we're much to smart to root for a bunch of old white males in masks.<br />Still, \\"Watchmen\\" is intricate and compelling.  You could probably read it in one sitting, though I prefer to space it out over a month - you're less likely to skim over its many intricacies.	2003-06-25
US	49374774	R281IJ3MEFB0HO	0451199669	849860918	The Blair Witch Project	Books	3	3	3	N	N	slim read offers bits for Blair Witch fans	To add to all of the tie-in books and dead-serious \\"mockumentaries\\" comes this - \\"The Dossier\\", a scrapbook of the investigation surrounding the disappearance of Heather, Josh and Mike in October of 1994 and the recovery of their footage.  By now, everybody knows that our victims vanished while shooting a documentary about a witch who has haunted generations of citizens of Burkitsville (nee Blair), Maryland.  Despite an exhaustive search, the footage and Josh's car remained the only evidence left behind.  The recovered footage - the film and the videotapes meant to document its creation - depict Heather, Josh and Mike being stalked by an unseen presence, desperate to escape a seemingly endless forest.  <br />Ofcourse, the real fun is how the film blurred the lines between fact and fiction on both sides of the camera (film students go into the forest, believing the witch to be a legend, until the legend comes for them; ads for the flick hinted that the story of the missing students was true when it wasn't).  \\"Dossier\\" follows tradition - picking up the story from the perspective of private investigators hired by Heather's mother to solve the mystery.  Like the film, \\"Dossier\\" keeps the tension high by masking its subject well - the \\"narrative\\" consists of memos, letters and transcripted phone calls compiled by the Buck Buchanan detective agency.  It's obvious that nobody attached to the project believes in the witch legend, though their memos only detail weirder findings, and an enigma whose solution becomes more elusive.<br />While \\"Dossier\\" knows the tricks of the film, it brings less to the legend than the film did.  It's a short, thin read, one giving us bits without fleshing much out.  We learn of the origins of Blair and of Elly Kedward, the future witch.  But Kedward's story never goes beyond one we can label as man's cruelty to man.  (A mysterious, if otherwise decent figure, Kedward is driven into the woods, presumably to her death; successive generations are haunted by her.)  We also learn more about Rustin Parr who murdered a group of Burkittsville children during WWII.  (Parr's story is an oddball footnote to the legend - he's obviously a nut, but devotees of Blair Witch can't divorce themselves of the idea that his actions were a genuine manifestation of the witch. More on Parr, later.)  <br />Unfortunately, the patchwork narrative misses details or at least fails to highlight them.  \\"Dossier\\" was probably going the subtle route for deep chills and preserving the surface rationale for the story as a record of a professional investigation, but some of the details inexplicably glossed over seem as much as interest to us as to Buck Buchanan.  We learn for example that Heather's camera and film were found inside of a wall of a ruined house by a group of students, the implication being that the ruin dated to civil war times, and the sections in which the camera was found looks to have been undisturbed since then.  At this point, having only caught the flick on cable, and missed both the \\"Curse of the Blair Witch\\" and any of the special editions of the original (and having read none of the books) I naturally assumed at first that the ruin was the abandoned house in which Heather and Josh enter at the end of the film.  However, it's soon apparent that the ruin nothing like that house, which closely resembles the one in which Rustin Parr committed his multiple murders (remember all those handprints?  Those are supposed to be the handprints of children), a house which no longer exists.  Nevertheless, \\"Dossier\\" passes the house by entirely, and does little more with the footage itself, even though it's the only tangible evidence of mystery.  I thought \\"Dossier\\" and \\"Blair Witch Porject\\" consciously decided on keeping Parr conspicuously nearby but separate, only adding to the sense of mystery - until Parr became the subject of a \\"Blair Witch\\" - licensed video game.<br />Two things kill the fun offered by \\"Dossier\\" - it's a slim read, and it lacks any of the tension suffered by the heroes of the film.  Though the heroes of \\"Dossier\\" raise and then eliminate various possible solutions, they never seriously consider the fact that they are victims of an elaborate con perpetrated by Heather and crew (sure they're working for Heather's mom, but even so they're still investigators).  The \\"con\\" idea would have given \\"Dossier\\" a severely needed shot of tension, and is only one idea that could have really fleshed the book out.  It's clear from \\"Dossier\\" that both it and the movie drew from the same inspiration that led to the novel \\"A House of Leaves\\" - a huge, dense mystery composed of overlapping narratives (with their own fonts and piles of footnotes) centered around a mysterious documentary about a house whose interiors rebel against laws of time and space.  With a bit more effort and time, \\"Dossier\\" could have done much to enliven the mystery of \\"Blair Witch\\" while providing a great alternative to readers intimidated by the insurmountable size and narrative of \\"House\\".  Instead, it does neither.	2003-06-25
US	49374774	R3BJG2QTDM19HQ	0385041837	683114333	H.M.S. Ulysses	Books	4	21	21	N	N	relentless tale of one ship in an arctic war	The HMS Ulysses was built for one mission - escorting convoys from Scotland to Murmansk, Russia.  Though a novel, \\"Ulysses\\" stays to a very specific historical context - the RN's desperate missions to keep Russia supplied during WWII.  In this novel, he follows the travails of the Ulysses as it sets forth on a convoy that has every hint of disaster.  It's 1943, the tide of the war had turned against the Axis on every front but on the seas. Though devotees of either nautical fiction or WWII novels are actually the last to label WWII as \\"the good war\\", even they might be shocked to learn the desperate straits through which MacLean sails his titular ship.  The \\"Murmansk Run\\" has convoys sailing through waters rife with terror both natural and man-made - horrors to which Ulysses has long become familiar with, yet never immune.  Worn down by the arctic storms, by constant attacks from German subs, dive bombers and cruisers, by outbreaks of TB and under constant threat of the mighty Battleship Tirpitz, Ulysses is a ship coming apart at the seams. The only thing holding the crew and ship together is there respect for its young and ailing captain and the desperation of the allied war effort. Their superiors in Admiralty would gladly supply less outdated escorts with more experienced crews, or replace their undersized (and outgunned) escort jeep carriers with fleet aircraft carriers - if that were available (during a deceptively simple dialog early on, officers detail the desperation of their situation, which includes rusty old ships with ripe crews, and escort carriers which would never be confused with the main-fleet monsters). But disintegrate the ship does, under attack by u-boats, Hipper-class cruisers, Condor bombers and the ceaseless assault of the Arctic. McLean does a superlative job taking both crew and vaunted ship apart. While he doesn't glorify war, he doesn't stoop at taking cheap shots at those who lead the war-effort either.  (Those familiar with the lore ofthe \\"Murmansk Run\\" may wonder if this book fictionalizes the tragedy known only as \\"PQ-17\\"; in fact, MacLean mentions that tragedy in an extended foot-note early on.  It's an unusual device, but an effective one, since it allows MacLean to state unequivocally where he stands, and bravely make the case for RN planners who doubtlessly suffered the blame for PQ-17's casualties.  Further, it frames the context of the \\"Murmansk Run\\" while implying that, though he's aware of the background behind the Russia-bound convoys, he won't be enslaved to write a bloodless fictionalized version of them.  Instead, the footnote makes it plain that MacLean wants to write his own book, a promise that he fulfills).  Neither does McLean stoop to gory effects. \\"Ulysses\\" neither glorifies war nor condemns it with cheap tactics.  One reviewer took issue with the book's poor characterization, and that complaint is actually dead-on with respect to one of its characters.  Though MacLean's treatment of an incompetent junior officer who blames others for his clumsiness is gratuitous (MacLean, rather than his characters, personally concludes the officer's active-duty status is the result of numerous mistakes, adding plenty of proof that the subject isn't even worth debate), it takes up a mercifully short amount of the book.  Slim character development is acceptable because the author makes it clear that individuality was one of the sacrifices (like fresh food, and not having to worry about frostbite) that Ulysses' crew are forced to forego due to the war.  Instead of nuances, the only sense of singularity that any crewman can have under those circumstances is whether he will bend or break with the arctic tide - a question that will keep you guessing to the end.  Many authors will claim that they can put their readers on the decks of ships or in planes in war, but MacLean is not only one of few who suceeds but achieves the incredible feat of brining the tale to life - stingingly icy salt spray, U-Boats and all - but makes it a world you can't quite tear yourself away from.	2003-05-18
US	49374774	RW5K57INJAYTJ	0425136612	708727402	Night of the Hawk	Books	3	5	6	N	N	none-too shocking technothriller	Another epic technothriller of redundant proportions.  \\"Hawk\\" follows the adventures of Pat Maclanahan and the crew of the \\"Old Dog\\" in post-Soviet Europe.  Brown's novels circulate through several geo-political hot-spots (China, Iran and former east-bloc states).  Here, the accent is on the Baltic states, upon which former soviet Russia (not \\"former\\" enough for Brown's liking) seeks to reassert her power.  Lithuanians trying to remake their country must stand alone against the might of the Russian military.  Meanwhile, Russian hardliners inside of Lithuania hope to bring the former east-bloc state into the Russian fold - apparently by creating an extensive laboratory called Fisikous that designs and builds high-tech weapons, including a stealthy strike-fighter designed by the captured American Dave Lugar and patterned along the same technology as the EB-52.  As Russian aggression becomes more overt, American forces bolster a coalition of Turkish and Lithuanian warplanes to turn back the tide.<br />This was a peculiarly messy Brown novel, adding to the problems you normally run up against in his books.  For one thing - what's it even about?  The specter of a powerful post-Soviet Russia using its military to rebuild its Soviet-era supremacy isn't a new idea for Brown (or one he'll abandon - witness \\"Warrior Class\\").  There is no central threat that must be eliminated by a certain deadline, so there's no tension or any sense that the story is building to a climax the way \\"Storming Heaven\\" did.  We're supposed to root for the brave Lithuanians who quickly become the \\"Davids\\" in a high-tech David-and-Goliath story, but when their leader reveals that he's training an army of warriors patterned after Lithuania's medieval knights, you wonder how loopy \\"David\\" can be while remaining the favored underdog.  The subplot about wicked ex-Soviets designing and building high-tech weaponry ready for battle is ludicrous.  As a former air warrior himself, Brown must appreciate that you need more than fancy computers to actually turn out a prototype airplane - let alone one that can integrate a complex weapons and sensors suite and take the punishment of combat.  Furthermore, with the Soviet position as unpopular in Lithuania as Brown can make it, it's impossible to reasonably imagine what good these Soviet wannabes can expect from their gleaming weaponry.  (You figure that the pricetag of any one of Fiskous's aircraft, these Russian hardliners could arm thousands of Russian convicts with assault rifles and RPG's and airdrop them into Lithuania).  Instead, as if on an episode of \\"Airwolf\\", the bad guys decide to cast caution to the wind, and duke it out against the heroes in the air.  It's almost as if the researchers of Fisikous are in another book entirely - while Europe struggles to throw off the yoke of the new Russia, these guys sit around their labs arguing about aerodynamics and radar cross-section.  Ofcourse, Brown doesn't let the plotting get too far along (when it does, he quickly summarizes everything) before fast-forwarding to the action - which in \\"Hawk\\" alternate between air warfare scenes and blatant Clinton bashing (whether you loved the Clinton years or loved to hate the Clintons themselves, and unless you're a rabid basher of Billary, you're likely to find Brown's barbs gratuitous at best and outright malicious at worst).  <br />The story's biggest weakness is meant to be its surprise - Dave Lugar returns!  Feared dead when left behind at the end of the original \\"Flight of the Old Dog\\", we now know that he was \\"rescued\\" by the Russians, who brainwashed him into turning over America's deepest military aviation secrets.  Somehow passed to Fisikous, he's become the unwitting creative genius behind its stealthy fighter.  Unfortunately, Lugar's story is only one of many details from other Brown books to make an appearance here.  Brown obviously likes the idea that he's created a continuum of characters whose lives are wider than thecovers of any one of his books.  Unfortunately, the characters are so one-note (Brown prefers to summarize them in miniature dossiers rather than develop them as organic characters) that any attention paid to their adventures in other books seems out of place and distracting.  This creates an odd paradox: you've had to have read any of the other books to appreciate the significance of the references Brown makes to them, but \\"Hawk\\" so follows the formula of those older books without bringing anything new to the reader, that Browns fans will have the least fun reading this one.  We still have overly exhaustive explanations of how new weapons are based on what's tried and true of existing technology, Brown's pilots still exchange extended long dialog while flying their high-performance aircraft into battle, Brown's villains (liberals, Russians and US Naval officers) continue to annoy, and Brown himself treats his stories as an opportunity to demonstrate everything he knows about the military - even when the plot or the need to develop it in get in the way.  Whether Brown's details are even correct is a subject I'll save for \\"true brothers\\".  Grasp of details, however, is not the same thing as making those details flesh out the story or even the scenes in which all of that technology comes to bear.  Though by the end of \\"Hawk\\" you'll know what a radar-warning receiver sounds like, or what an EW display looks like, the thrill of flying in combat is missing - Brown neglected to give his characters enough feeling to convey the rigors of being shot at while flying at 600 mph.  This is one of Brown's weaker books - fans should opt instead for \\"Skymasters\\" or \\"Battle Born\\".	2003-05-11
US	49374774	R1JIFEGFXVXW5B	0553580272	737842842	House Atreides (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	2	14	18	N	N	completely misses what dune is about	\\"Dune: House Atreides\\" is the first in a trilogy of prequels to the \\"Dune\\" novels of Frank Herbert.  Like sequels however, the only lesson you'll get from \\"Atreides\\" is to leave well enough alone.  Frank Herbert was masterful because he could conjure up a vast universe without losing sight of his characters' humanity, and he knew how to both deftly craft his surroundings, and keep the historic details of the Dune universe tantalizingly vague (the appeal of Dune's hidden history stemmed largely from Herbert's refusal to dissect).  The new trilogy ignores the qualities of the original's prose and the otherworldly seduction of its myriad plotting.<BR>For those new to the series, Dune is set in a far distant future, when man has spread across the stars.  Once enslaved by machine minds, men rose up in a religious crusade whose legacy has been the absolute prohibition against artificial computers.  Instead, vast schools enhance the human mind, turning men into living computers called Mentats.  Huge starships are guided by \\"third-stage navigators\\" - artificially evolved human beings who see through walls of time/space.  Though technologically advanced, humanity is ruled by an emperor through an aristocracy (the \\"Landsraad\\") perpetually at odds with itself.  (Individual houses endlessly plot against each other ala Machiavelli).  Outside of Landsraad, various other groups jockey for power - like the insidious Tleilaxu who are masters of forbidden technology, or the Bene Gesserit who conduct genetic engineering experiments designed to create a suber-being called the \\"kwisatz haderach\\".  Each party wield great power, but is checked both by each other and by their dependence on a mystical spice called \\"mlange\\" - a drug which stretches human lifespans, widens consciousness and, in really huge doses, turns humans into navigators.  In short, mlange underlies every aspect of this society.  Unfortunately, technology hasn't supplied a substitute for mlange, and the inhospitable planet Dune is its only source.<BR>In \\"Atreides\\" we meet younger versions of the noble Leto Atreides, the vile Vlad Harkonnen, the slyly murderous Fehnring and Shaddam - the future emperor. Aside from other characters also already established in Dune lore, we meet the royal family of Ix (soon to be exiled when Ix is overrun by Tleilaxu) and Leto's parents. Title aside, \\" Atreides\\" tells as much about the Atreides as everyone else. Actually, Shaddam, gets the lion's share of attention. With his father Elrood kept alive through mlange addiction, and showing no sign of releasing the throne, Shaddam conspires with Fenring to kill him.  Leto, not yet a duke, travels to Ix, whose rulers develop technology at the limits of the law.  Leto's strict mother (whose religious fundamentalism dates this book as none of the original novels had) distrusts the ruling Ixians.  The reigning duke is too fun-loving a guy to accord with the duchess' stern dogmatism.  Vladimir Harkonnen, already Baron when \\"Atreides\\" starts, has yet to become the physically repulsive ogre of the original epic.  Shaddam, already considering himself emperor, conspires to \\"give\\" Ix to the Tleilaxu, confident can blame it on a feud his father nursed against the Ixian rulers.  In return, the Tleilaxu will try to develop a synthetic mlange.  None of the original books' intense plotting nor their focus on their characters' perspective are in evidence here. No character possesses any depth. Fenring is a master in the art of murder, even when just giving advice, but here he's just annoying, and his plotting is seldom Macchiavellian. Neither Anderson nor Herbert develop Fenring in a way that suggests his complete reversal in the original \\"Dune\\".  Leto is the hero of the story, but he comes off as one of those angst-ridden characters of a Dawson's Creek spin-off.  None of the myriad subplots reflect an understanding of the Dune-universe.  The Bene gesserit never arouse suspicion, even though their plan to breed the messianic Kwisatz Haderach threatens everybody, especially the Navigators (since they possess the closest thing to absolute power in the Dune universe). Instead it's the illegal invasion of Ix that unites the characters in this book - but who cares? (the Tleilaxu turn the Ixians against their rulers for whom they do the most work and reap the least benefits.) The authors completely miss the underpinnings of the age old Atreides/Harkonnen vendetta (they take the feud as the logical product of Atreides nobility and Harkonnen villainy.  The point of a prequel is to show how things came to be the way they are, after nearly turning out differently). Another error is Leto's  father - described as a cruel blowhard in the original \\"Dune\\", he's now a benevolent ruler who lives for his loyal subjects whom he entertains with frequent bullfights. But above all is Shaddam's nonsensical collusion with the Tleilaxu.  At Fenring's urging, Shaddam presses the Tleilaxu to develop a synthetic version of mlange in order to both free his throne from spice mining and elevate it over the spicing guild.  What the authors fail to grasp is that success would only swap the monopoly of the navigators for that of the Tleilaxu (it would also nullify the industrial complex that mines the spice, one of the economic structures that both ensures the stability of the universe and, because the throne manages it, allows Shaddam to effectively rule.  Besides, if the Tleilaxu reneged, how would Shaddam enforce his end?)  The unblanced deal would make sense had Shaddam nursed a vendetta against the Ixians - but the grudge against Ix was Elrood's. <BR>Being part of a series, \\"Atreides\\" doesn't have to be open-ended (with half-finished plotlines and characters left for the next book), but it is.  Some subplots don't come together at all - like the expeditions of planetologist Liet Kynes or the story of C'tair, a loyal Ixian working against the Tleilaxu. But worst of all, the novel lacks a solid voice, a single perspective in its scenes to feel the pain, joy, fear and triumph that all the plotting must create. \\"Atreides\\" simply fails because, unlike the spice mlange that underlies much of the plotting, it is neither addictive nor consciousness expanding.	2003-05-09
US	49374774	R1GPT352F54GHM	0061096849	397098847	Nimitz Class	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Avoid sneak attacks by	Class refers to a generation of ships named after the first ship of that generation. In Nimitz Class, a fictitious US aircraft carrier of the Nimitz Class is vaporized in a nuclear explosion. Signs point to a carefully planned act of terrorism involving a rogue \\"Kilo\\" Class sub with a nuclear-tipped torpedo. Unable to prove the theory at first, US military leaders stick with an embarrassing cover story (it was all an accident) while sending a brilliant nuclear weapons expert on an international hunt for the skipper of the rogue sub. In an intelligent move, the handsome and brilliant analyst sets off for Scotland, where the RN trains prospective skippers for command of her subs and those of other nations (called the \\"perisher course\\"  because it's the greatest single health hazard to the career of would-be submarine commanders). Scotland is also the best place to start because, unlike the US, the RN trains skippers for diesel-electric subs which are more likely to have been involved in the carrier attack than nuclear subs. (Diesel subs, due to their electric drive are inherently quieter than nuclear boats; there are also more of them in the hands of \\"rogue states\\" than nuclear boats). While a lead is pursued in Scotland, US forces zero in on an Iranian naval base housing  Kilo class subs (Russian-built boats being one of the more modern of their kind) and strike it.  This is a common trend in Pat Robinson's books in which America's military leadership has no trouble committing rash, boneheaded or simply irresponsible courses of action like attacking other countries' militaries - and neglecting to even consider holding themselves responsible when the rationale proves thin. This wouldn't be a such a problem were Robinson not as enamored with American military leaders as he makes obvious that he is. Back in Scotland, our hero suffers a run of great luck - actually, it's we who suffer since the book bombards us with the following coincidences: our heroic investigator hooks up with the one of the RN's legendary submarine-command trainers (the \\"Perisher in-Chief\\") and his lovely daughter. Looking through report cards of prior trainees, the investigator zeros in on a likely suspect who, lucky again, was also courting the Perisher's ravishing daughter. The trail points to Israeli submariner, but then takes a sharp swerve when it appears that the culprit is not all he seems, and it takes the intrepid naval investigator a scant few pages to discover the rogue's submariner's true origins when the Israelis proved unable to for years. Back on our side of the Atlantic, military leaders hit a brick wall while trying to trace the rogue sub to Russia's Black Sea fleet: it's \\"impossible\\" to cross the shallow waters of Turkey's Bosporus submerged. Before the President will authorize the USN to form his attack subs into a huge nuclear wolfpack to hunt the rogue down, he wants proof that the Bosporus theory isn't as implausible as it sounds. Instead of joining the hunt then, our hero joins a team of elite RN submariners who aim to prove the case, and sail submerged from the Med into the Black Sea.<br />This was a horrible book -  much more fun to write about than actually read. Besides the laughably bad dialog (are we yanks that alien to the British? an African-American character who sounds like he walked off an episode of the \\"Little Rascals\\") and the license the author grants to the American military to take whatever overt action it wants on the most scant pretext, it's just an incoherent yarn. The author seems more in love with the intricacies of military hardware than actually fastening them into a plot anybody can follow. The author devotes so much time telling us about the workings of a Nimitz Class carrier, that you half expect him to use another one in the story once the first one is destroyed. Instead, once the author has shown us how much he knows about aircraft carriers, any other use (like advancing the story) is unimportant and can bediscarded. The story throws twists and turns in your direction (the rogue submariner is Israeli - then he's not; the attack was orchestrated by Iran, then Iraq; submerged transit through Turkish waters is impossible, no it's possible) but never bothers to flesh any of them out before changing track. None of the characters are remotely convincing - Robinson eagerly makes them sound brilliant without making them all that smart, and lets them talk tough without being very responsible. The plot is full of implausible ideas. The story could survive these leaps of logic if Robinson gave us any reason to, but he seems to take for granted that we'll believe the vaunted Israeli military would be tricked into accepting a hardcore Iranian (or Iraqi) agent into its ranks. The idea of \\"proving\\" the hero's theory of a submerged crossing from the Black Sea by trying to repeat it has a monster hole anybody can navigate: while successfully copying the theorized submarine transit would prove the hero's theory, failure would not conversely disprove the theory.  Robinson doesn't appreciate that technothrillers are all about that - taking a technically implausible idea and showing how impossible it's not. Unlike most mediocre technothrillers which lamely avoid this challenge, \\"Nimitz\\" tries to elude it twice. Robinson not only ducks the Israeli-Iran (or Iraqi) dilemma, but doesn't begin to explain the rogue Kilo managed to sneak past defenses of a USN carrier battle group geared by design and training to find hostile subs. (failure to address that is not just a plot lapse, but one of many technical errors which abound in this book which hails itself as \\"frighteningly realistic\\". \\"Nimitz\\" puts technical correctness over plot and character development, but doesn't even get that right.)

US	49374774	RM7Y7NETSBVSF	039914935X	569028147	Typhoon	Books	4	4	5	N	N	above average submarine technothriller	A crew of desperate Russian sailors led by a wily former soviet submarine commander desperately try to sail the \\"Baikal\\", the last of Russia's huge Typhoon class ballistic missile submarines, across arctic seas. Their destination - the northern pacific, where they will rendezvous with the Red Chinese navy and then transfer ownership of their mighty warship to the Chinese. Complications center on the fact that the Americans already paid the Russians a billion dollars to scrap the sub, about as much China is willing to pay to acquire it. Captain Markov, a veteran of the K-219 disaster (an actual event chronicled by the author in the non-fiction 'Hostile Waters') is no fool, and he knows the dangers ahead. Americans aside, the vast polars seas offer a challenege by themselves - choked with shallow passages and pressure ridges from floes overhead.  Nobody has ever braved those waters in a ship as large as Baikal, but the Russians need that money, and stand to lose more if the Americans can prove the Russians had welched on their deal to turn the ship into razor blades. Easing things for the Russians (who are unaware of a growing crisis in Taiwan that may bode an immediate use for their sub under the banner of the PRC's navy) is the chaotic state of their nearest hunter - the attack sub USS Portland. Portland. Portland is one of the latest of the USN's Los Angeles Class attack submarines - nuclear powered hunters designed to find subs like Baikal and kill them. Though their CO is an experienced vet - a grizzled sage of the cold war, schooled by the generation that brought Imperial Japan to its knees - White immediately reveals Captain Vann to be an imperious tyrant, an unregenerate caveman in navy khaki. In short, while the Russians have been purified their traditional role of agressive, unimaginative and glory-hungry idiots, White's book has not - and the fall-guy for this story is none other than Captain Vann himself. Vann's career, we learn, is only beginning to pickitself up from a near disaster suffered when, as CO of the attack sub \\"Baton Rouge\\", he collided with a Russian sub he'd been shadowing. (The fictionalized crash echos the true-life event in which that sub collided with a Sierra class sub - a nuclear attack boat among one of the latest of the Soviet arsenal - in 1992. Both subs survived the incident, but never returned to sea.) Vann lords it over his crew, saving much of his wrath for Lt. Cdr. Steadman, his XO, and Lt. Scavullo, the ship's nominal female officer. Steadman desperately needs Vann's endorsement for entry into PCO - Prospective Command school, the training ground for subamrine commanders. Scavullo's problem is simpler - chauvanism.  Vann chafes under the idea that politicians are using the navy as a laboratory for social science, bound by the laws of political correctness. As a Russian linguist, Scavullo is invaluable while the sub prowls near the old socviet naval complex of the Kola Peninsula, but to Vann, she's only a 'rider' - a worse-than-useless addition to the crew, and fair game for any one of boat's less palatable officers. Using some of Portland's less savory crewmen, Vann sets Scavullo up for failure. Though set on command school, XO Steadman quickly coems to Scavullo's aid. Scavullo returns the favor by cluing Steadman into evidence she's picked up through Russian nautical communciations of Baikal's stealthy transit into the Barent's sea. (Actually, Steadman is the only one who'll listen to Scavullo's theories about anything). Though Steadman also enlists Master Chief Browne - who holds the title of COB, the ship's highest ranking enlisted officer - to his side, Vann retains command with all of its perks and caprice, setting the stage for a battle of wills aboard the cramped Portland. A similar battle seems brewing aboard Baikal, where Captain Markov learns that he was apprised of only some of the details of his mission. And the chase is on.<br />This was an above average submarine yarn - not quite up to either 'Red October' or 'Sink the Potemkin', but closer to either of those books than any of the other books that routinely appear with submarines on their covers. On the negative side, the story recalls those two books too well - venturing on territory we've seen before (Typhoon class subs slipping out of Murmansk and sinister political officers), making comparison impossible to avoid. While the author takes the brave step of making the US Captain the bad guy, his brand of villainy seems a holdover from 1989 (Vann's character seems identical to any one of those who appeared in 'end of the cold war' movies of the late 1980's to early 90's, a militant devotee of the religion of the neverending war, ignorant of how the real world has passed him by; White also makes Vann misogynist, enraged by the prospect of having women tear down the military's gender barriers of the USN. While that sentiment would have been plausible in the early 1990's when women were first entering combat duty, White reminds us - dropping reminders of the Kursk tragedy of 2000 - that his setting is supposed to be as up-to-date as we are.)<br />On the plus side (a big one here) White's story is shaped convincingly by the interiors of the two subamrines which drive his story. Most submarine technothrillers reduce the ships and those who populate them  into meaningless pieces of some bigger chess game, never fleshed out or convincing. White in contrast starts his story aboard Portland and Baikal, and seldom strays from either ship. While other authors claim to make you feel like you're on board a nuclear submarine at war, White's writing actually delivers, even if it puts you on a ship full of characters you'd never wanty to have anything to do with, and never lets you off.  If you can overlook some implausible charcterizations and plot ideas that seem blatantly ripped off from every submarine thriller of the last 20 years, you'll still find \\"Typhoon\\" a tight read you won't soon put down.	2003-04-27

On the eve of \\"Desert Storm\\", Lenson is given provisional command of the \\"Gaddis\\", an obsolete and worn out Knox class destroyer about to be handed over to the Pakistani navy.  Lenson's command is virtual - the Pakistani's are already on board, and they consider the ship their own.  Between the ship's sorry condition and the inexperience of the Pakistani crew (most acute in their captain), Lenson musters every resource he can to get Gaddis seaworthy.  Frequently running into interference from Captain Khashar, Lenson nurses the hope that he can use the inevitable war in Iraq as a springboard to combat duty - perhaps at the command of the Gaddis.  On reaching Karachi, Lenson's wishes are miraculously and ironically fulfilled - with the US reclaiming Gaddis and sending Lenson into battle.  On the downside, Lenson finds that his assignment will take him into the south Pacific, against a mysterious rogue navy of red Chinese-backed pirates.  Further complicating his situation is his lack of US support: the Pakistanis paid for most of Gaddis's weaponry and removed all of its ammo when the American's reclaimed the ship.  Gaddis carries neither torpedoes, missiles nor even an ASW helicopter.  Supplies and fuel remain at critical levels throughout the book, compounding a severe morale problem among the Gaddis's crew of surface fleet rejects.  Lenson faces mutiny throughout most of the book, most severely at the end.  Against dropping morale, Lenson has only vague hints that he's even supposed to have more than nominal command, and nagging doubts that his hunt for pirates will force him to become something of a pirate himself.<br />This is great stuff - it's a bigger story than \\"The Gulf\\", though that means that it often seems like Poyer is trying to get past details - conversations he didn't want to flesh out with dialog, nautical maneuvers he feared would bog the plot down - more often than he had in other books.  Though Gaddis has a crew of rejects, it's not as fully detailed as the one in \\"The Passage\\".  Poyer drops details from his other books, though they seem extraneous - neither advancing the plot nor hindering it for those who haven't read them.  Though sometimes seeming abbreviated, \\"Sea\\" is still a meatier book than naval technothrillers by other writers.  Poyer isn't afraid of using flawed, sometimes unlikable characters plagued by self-doubt and lacking cutting-edge technology.  While other writers are happy enough to tell you how non-existent missiles work or what computer screens look like, Poyer's books make you feel like you're on the tilting deck of a \\"tin can\\" in rough seas.  Watch out for that wave!	2003-04-22
US	49374774	R2U8JZRT6XCS01	042507966X	903922763	Taxi Dancer	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Confusing take on the Thud-war	This novel offers a welcome change from similarly themed books.  In most novels telling of the VN air war, we have a heroic core of brilliant fliers flying against both the enemy up north and \\"the politicians\\".  Closer by, the heroes must deal with careerist and typically unscrupulous superior officers.  These rear-echlon types care nothing for the infamous \\"rules of engagement\\" which Washington used to severely restrict pilots during the war in Vietnam, but exploit them anyway as a weapon against the honest and brave fighter pilots.  \\"Taxi Dancer\\"  (I didn't even know what that meant until after I'd read this story.  Honest!!) has the war as more of a backdrop to a more local war between a younger F-105 pilot and his commander - a vet who passed up his chance for greatness after the Korean war.  Our young hero has just become USAF's newest fighter ace (no small feat - the lovely F-105 was one of the fastest planes in the war, but it's dogfighting performance was marginal at best) but already wants out of the war.  Though set during a time when the war still looked \\"winnable\\", the heroes of \\"Dancer\\" are savvy enough to see where the tide of victory is heading.  <br />So why doesn't this uncommon story soar above the others?  Because it's still preposterous.  Heywood hints that the craven wing commander isn't at war so much with his hero as with an academy competitor (always referred to as \\"Brown III\\") who alwasy seems one step ahead (instead of the flying flack magnets like the F-105, Brown III commands a unit of Phantom jets;  The gap stands to widen further as Brown III is expected to receive internal cannon-armed F-4E's).  Set between these two conflicts, Heywood fails to flesh out either of them.  Instead, Heywood clothes his characters as hyper-tough, but it feels forced (like when the more seasoned pilots intimidate the newbies with their scars - \\"Just because you're in the clubhouse doesn't mean you're in the club!\\") and quite fake.  Even the title - linkingcombat aviation with prostitution - seems a forced metaphor.  Heywood ludicrously wraps things up when the evil commander sends his younger antagonist on a single-ship mission against the most impregnable target in Hanoi (itself, the most heavily defended city in the world), faking Washington's authroization for the attack, with the idea that it'll be a one-way mission, an idea that never seems to occur to the hero.<br />In every other respect, \\"Dancers\\" seems to fall into the same holes as almost every other VN air war novel - we never get the war from a single, forceful perspective, and the author never really convincingly conveys how hard it is to fly one of those monsters normally referred to as \\"tactical aircraft\\".	2003-04-11
US	49374774	R3K7ENYMMI8AQG	0441369340	178582283	Silent Hunter	Books	4	23	23	N	N	Great, but subdued Cold-War era sub thriller	This book came out in 1987, so it needn't explain why the Russians and Americans are still duking it out.  The book follows form that would be done to death in Dale Brown novels - an American technological breakthrough coincides with some aggressive move by the Soviets.<br />In this case, the Soviets close off the arctic waters off Norway, turning it into a Russians bathtub.  The yanks strike back with the \\"Imperator\\", a gigantic submarine the size of an aircraft carrier (and I don't think they meant the small fleet carriers of WWII, frequent models for the soviet Typhoon class).  Big enough to carry a fairly sized infranty team and their attack helicopter, the Imperator is designed to break through the Russian blockade.  The Russians respond by sending in their top submarine skipper, and a wolfpack of their top subs (the inner cover of the paperback ed. had a great picture of a raging sub-sea battle, with the titanic US sub firing torpedoes in every direction, burning the ocean with flaming Soviet submarines).  Nevertheless, the Imperator pretty much outclasses anything the Russians throw at it.  A revolutionary computer called \\"Ceasar\\" can knock Bear bombers out of the sky or pick off incoming torpedoes.<br />This was a great book for its time.  The technological aspects of the story are pretty vague (we get little sense of what the sub can do before called upon to do it; it's like the author is making the sub a more powerful ship as the story progresses), and I'm not sure what the point is of sending a mammoth sub to carrya few troops into Norway - how big can the sub be and still carry a meanigful number of troops?  The bigger problem of the story is how heavily it relies on its high-tech: the guidance of torpedoes and the nearly foolproof computer that runs Imperator.  This is a problem because much of the book's action is driven by weaponry on automatic and thus independent of human control.  Torpedoes are launched and track their targets or are spoofed by countermeaures.  Ceasar detects a threat and lashed out with a blue-laser or something else.  Weapons either do what they're designed to, or they fail.  It's almost like the humans (or any characters) don't belong in the book at all.<br />That's actually odd considering how the story appears unusually sympathetic to its characters - American and Russian.  The Russian submarine commander is actually the most sympathetic in the book, otherwise bereft of the fiercely dogmatic communists of similar late 1980's books.  The characters would be great if Taylor could somehow make them both deep characters and warriors.  Instead, the war runs on autopilot, giving the characters really little to do. If \\"Hunter\\" excels at anything, it's a reminder that thrillers about submarines should keep their settings in their submarines.  Because submarines are scary mostly because you can't just step out of one, an authentic thriller must highlight that sense of being trapped inside.  \\"Hunter\\" highlights this by keeping its settings confined to the submarines involved - and not losing its focus by tangenting back to some Pentagon situation room, complete with inter-service rivalry and liberal politicians.  In short, if nothing in this yarn will exactly grab you, it at least holds you for a very long time.	2003-03-07

At the dawn of a new century, a fascist president helms an America that features everything evil we can expect of the \\"New World Order\\" - including domination by corporations and an insurmountable gap between rich and poor.  Abolishing term-limits (with each succesiive inauguaration, the crowds of supproters seems to be inversely proportional to the armed guards) the President spends most of his time reminding us how happy we should be thanks to him.  At first trapped in Cabrini, Martha's savage misfortunes provide her an odd escape - first institutionalization, then (because it will clean her record) enlistment with PAX, a sort of corporate backed citizen's army.  As a soldier on every one of America's frontlines, Martha witnesses how America's new empire is born, even as its dying.  The enemies of course are not the Russians, but competing corporations (mostly theme parks and fast-food companies).  In case you haven't caught on, \\"Give Me Liberty\\" is all about an advanced American state slowly disintegrating under its own weight.  The country is soon gripped in civil wars - rather than a single conflict, the fighting is disorganized, along state, muncipal and corporate lines, and further complicated by various non-aligned factions, like the amazon women of the \\"First Sex Confederacy\\" and tribes of Native Americans armed with their own missiles.  Even the left-wing administration that (briefly) suceeds Rexall is overwhelmed by the evil that is the new century.<br />While the story of America is compelling, \\"Give Me Liberty\\" actually suceeds because it never abandons Martha.  Rather than some empty-headed figure upon whom \\"Give Me\\" can stamp its story, Martha is strong-willed, convincingly intelligent and surprisingly sympathetic.  We neverpity Martha nor can we condemn her for the ends she must take (which are violent - there's a fair amount of gore in the story).  The future landscape of America is compelling, yet the story appears heavy-handed in some spots (the orbiting laser cannons are overtly phallic; the fst-food wars are fought by robots styled after the avatars of many Fat-Boy restaurants; genetic engineering creates an army of hyper-intelligent mutants used as living computers - like the \\"Pre-Cogs\\" of \\"Minority Report\\"; other clones include an army of beautiful but super-strong blondes who manage to escape the billionaire who bred them; then there's a mysterious surgeon general who seems patterned on Darth Vader - always masked, speaking in short sentences and never leaving any doubt of his homicidal mania).  Still, the story can rely on our being continually focused on Martha.  In that respect, \\"Give Me Liberty\\" does not dissappoint.	2003-03-02
US	49374774	R1FXXOUFVN663E	070891442X	784832186	The Wild Geese (U)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Great mercenary adventure	A group of over-the-hill soldiers are called upon to assemble a mercenary army for a single mission: rescue the dissident leader of an embattled African nation.  When the current regime proves intractable at the negotiating table, a consortium of British companies hits on the perfect plan to turn things in their direction.  By springing the country's popular but jailed former leader out of jail (I guess he was supposed to be a stand-in for Patrice Lumamba, murdered former president of the Congo, but that's just a guess), they'll have the needed leverage.  The mercs they hire sound like they're about ready for retirement, but gamely decide on \\"one-last-mission\\".  The novel lightly but briefly plays up preparations in a way tat suggests the mission will be a walk-over.  Eventually, it is - unfortunately, our heroes forget that being mercenaries, they are not the only side that owes no allegiance.  When the regime caves in too quickly, the mercenaries' contractors decide that the Wild Geese are now a liability, and abandon them.  Now cut off in enemy territory, the mercenary army must fight its way out.  It's no easy go.<br />This was a great story, but it's not told all that well.  The real meat of the book is the desperate escape, but the entire story feels rushed, even though there's a great story to be told.  When our heroes are first introduced, the book hints at their complex lives ... without ever really fleshing them out.  Also, it's hard to believe that our heroes - hardly innocent characters - couldn't see their betrayal coming.  Still a great story, and certainly no small consolation for those who can't find the flick.	2003-02-28
US	49374774	R2LROCE2BDNXY0	0446516481	344653400	Fulcrum: A Top Gun Pilot's Escape from the Soviet Empire	Books	3	14	20	N	N	Great book, when it sticks to its story	\\"Fulcrum\\" tells the story of Alex Zuyev, a Soviet fighter pilot who flew his MiG-29 fighter across the Black Sea to Turkey in the spring of 1989.  An experienced and gifted aviator, Zuyev was never enamored with communism long enough t become disillusioned with it.  \\"Fulcrum\\" recounts Zuyev's childhood, joining the VVS, training for fighter pilot duty, and managing to miss Afghanistan (though he lobbied hard to go into a combat unit, his skills made him a natural choice for the first slot chosen to fly the advanced MiG-29).  At every turn, Zuyev is beaten down by the rigors of living in the CCCP - mindless dogmatism dominate much of the citizenry, while corruption and cronyism typify life among the higher-levels.  By 1985 and Gorbachev, the Soviet Union is terminal - with the economy in shambles and Afghnanistan bleeding the cream of the Russian military blind.  Even Gorbachev's good intentions backfire (like an experiment in prohibition that only invigorates the black market for Vodka, and drives everybody else to kill themselves seeking more dangerous substances to feed the national tradition of alcoholism).  Frustrated with the Soviet government, and fearing that he might be ordered to fly strike missions against civilian unrest, Zuyev decided it was time to get out.  Though admitting he knew safer ways to escape the Soviet Union (he openly scoffed at the myth that the Soviet frontier is an impassible wall), Zuyev decides that his defection will be spectacular.  Concocting an elaborate plan involving a cake spiked with sleeping pills, Zuyev plots to steal one of his squadron's MiG-29's, along with its advanced missiles.  Nothing goes according to plan, but Zuyev manages to get his jet to freedom (only to see it handed back to the Russians, missiles and all once he is granted asylum in Turkey).<br />\\"Fulcrum\\" is both enlightening and disappointing.  Certainly we've got a more inside look at the insides of Soviet life and the red military machine than we've had before, but the resulting story is one we've read about or heard about countless times - that life in the CCCP was a dispiriting grind between corruption and greed in the inner circles and robotic communism and deprivation everywhere else.  Doubtless, the Soviets deserved their bad rap, but there's little point to writing a book that does more to feed our biases than informs them.  Zuyev gives us an unparalleled look into the VVS, the branch of Soviet Military dedicated to long-range, offensive air operations (The Soviets had no single branch of the military for their Air Force, much as our AF was little more than a branch of the army until 1947).  At that point, \\"Fulcrum\\" rules, surpassing \\"MiG Pilot\\", the true story of Viktor Belenko who flew to the west in the seventies.  The novelty of concentrating on characters who otherwise exist as missile-fodder in Dale Brown novels is worth the price of the book.  Unfortunately, book seldom focuses on dedicated red fliers and their cranky MiGs - frequently interrupted to more anecdotes about the nightmare of soviet life.  Worse, when Zuyev does get back to being a fighter pilot, Zuyev never conveys what it's like to actually fly one of those amazing machines we call tactical aircraft.  This is especially annoying because Zuyev's background provided an excellent method for fleshing out the experience of flying the MiG-29: his prior experience flying the older, faster but less agile MiG-23.  Each plane is so distinct from the other, that each also provides a perfect counterpoint to the other.  Zuyev manages to entirely skip the sensation of first flying the -23, his first combat aircraft (while the -23 was not new when Zuyev first completed flight training, his class was the first to skip the older MiG-21).  Though stories of soviet life are necessary to frame the context of Zuyev's story, Zuyev turns that aspect of the story into the main story, one that overshadows even the wonder plane that becomes Zuyev's future.  Instead the story of being a MiG pilot (the one I cracked open this book expecting to read) is painfully abbreviated.  We don't even get a meaningful look into the flaws of the new jet (which had the directional instability common to contemporary aircraft of the west, but lacked the computer-augmented fly-by-wire controls standard in such aircraft; Zuyev mentions a flaw in the -29's early radar, but apparently one rectified earlier, since he never details it in his own plane; though gifted with supreme agility for a dogfighter, the MiG-29's small size meant it had painfully short range, while its pilots lacked the unobstructed visibility enjoyed by western pilots, and otherwise essential for dogfighting).  Zuyev further muddies the book when taking another path entirely - detailing a list of now revealed Soviet secrets, including those dealing with the fate of American POWs, and Soviet decisionmaking in the 1983 KAL shootdown.  While those subjects are important, the book places far too much importance on Zuyev's perspective merely because he is a Soviet, even though his personal proximity to those secrets is only slightly closer than that of the rest of us.  (I doubt very many Americans would accept a similar account on the Iranian Airbus incident or the Stark incident merely because they came from US sailors who were otherwise nowhere near those incidents when they occurred). <br />In short, \\"Fulcrum\\" is two books - a very often excellent book on an underserved topic, but an even more frequently frustrating book that gets in the way of the more interesting story.	2003-02-14

In this one, a band of Central Asian fanatics somehow manage to hijack a high-tech US Sub (SSN Kentucky) that is virtually undetectable.  The Russians have developed technology that may allow them to locate the sub, but they insist that the Americans provide an ASW expert who can guide them to it.  With little direction, the uninspiring crew of the equipped Russian sub don't quite cooperate with their new American crewman.  On the flipside, the American is a washed-up former sub skipper with a terrible secret, one that undermines his killer instinct.  The Russian sub equipped with the souped-up sonar is a Victor II class sub, an ancient nuclear boat (their successors, the Victor III first put to sea about 20 years ago).  The plan is to train the crew on using the wonder sonar, then transfer both it and crew to a more advanced sub.  Assuming there's time.<br />This was an interesting book, and between going into the novelty of its premise and the regular snatches of modern submarine technology, it's an interesting book.  What sinks this story is the idea that it could have been an even more interesting book.  We never get more than bare bones of an idea that the Victor II and its crew are at the bottom of the Russians pecking order (there's an evil Russian admiral with a topnotch flagship - a Sierra class attack sub that gives way to no boat; his disdain for the American and his new crew is one of the forces that slowly but surely elevates the hero in the eyes of his new crew).  Unfortunately, neither the crew or the broken down Victor II become more than cardboard figures - so it's no fun when they swap ends and decide to help the American.  The techno aspect of the book is somewhat light (not as much as Pat Robinson) and won't intimidate or enlight landlubbers like me.	2003-02-12
US	49374774	R1HR051VO34372	0451406036	701947619	Phoenix Sub Zero	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Like the Vortext Torpedo, it's got some bugs....	\\"Phoenix\\" is sort of like a submarine version of a story that combines \\"Sink the Bismark\\" and the story behind the 9-11 attacks.  Though it brings back Captain Pacino, commander of the cutting edge nuclear sub \\"Seawolf\\" amd hero of other Michael DiMercurio novels, the plot sets the book apart from his other books, and also keeps Pacino on the sidelines for most of the story.<br />The Plot: The Islamic world has united and formed a massive powerful union (UIF) that wars against the west.  The war itself is already old news when \\"Phoenix\\" starts.  The UIF, led by the enigmatic General Sihoud and slowly realizing that the tide has turned against them, crafts a deadly weapon - a \\"dirty\\" radiological bomb that can coat a major american city with a sticky film of plutonium.  Unfortunately (for them) the UIF have only figured out how to mount these bombs on short-range cruise missiles, and the UIF has no territory or assets anywhere near mainland America.  When a US strike at Sihoud's command narrowly fails to kill Sihoud himself, the general escapes and rendezvous at sea with the \\"Hegira\\", a high-tech UIF submarine supplied (like most of the UIF's cutting edge weaponry) by Japan, and already armed with the deadly missiles.  Knowing the situation desperate, Sihoud presses the sub to break out of the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic, where they will launch atleast one of their missiles on Washington.  Complicating things is the experience and numerical superiority of the Americans, the fact that none of Hegira's torpedo tubes are designed to be re-loaded at sea (like the VLS tubes on latter models of the Los Angeles Class SSN), and that Hegira's hi-tech makes the sub's capabilities almost as mysterious to its crew as it does its enemies.  On the other side, 3 of the USN's nuclear subs stand between Hegira and the US - Seawolf, Augusta and Phoenix.  Seawolf begins the book in dry-dock, where the Navy had been working feverishly to install tubes for the \\"Vortex\\", a revolutionary type of torpedo.  When a test for the new torp (a rocket-propelled wonder obviously influenced by the real-life Soviet \\"Shkval\\") goes disastrously wrong (both the test target and shooter are destroyed), the USN works feverishly to remove the tubes.  The hunt for the Hegira puts a crimp on those plans as well, and Pacino is forced to go to sea with the hated Vortex.  Augusta is a latter model Los Angeles Class SSN, almost a match for Seawolf, and commanded by a fearless master of submarine warfare.  Between the two subs is Phoenix, an aging \\"Flight I\\" Los Angeles Class boat, commanded by the very competent if less-than-stellar commander Kane.<br />This was a very good submarine thriller (considering \\"Shark Mutiny\\" was my last one) which, like the vortex missile packs a punch and a misfire in the same shot.  What goes wrong is the basic premise - a pitched war with the UIF (and even the UIF idea) seem pretty far-fetched.  Dimercurio goes to a lot of trouble creating Sihoud and getting him to Hegira - but since he doesn't do anything once he's on board (not being experienced or even informed on the dynamics of sub-war), there's no real reason for him to be there at all.  The idea that the US will give in after it's been hit by one of the UIF's dirty bombs (in an attack they know can't really be repeated) is also a big stretch.  Isn't there an at least as strong possibility that we'd just hit back harder?  Other stretches are the Vortex torpedoes - it's clear that they're hazardous from day-one (the Navy test fires them from unmanned drone subs) - but the Navy still guts their top attack sub just to install the unproven weapon aboard.  (That Pacinio works up a solution to the problem that otherwise eludes its designers doesn't make that twist any more acceptable)  The UIF are largely generic bad guys and (outside of the war situation) they're not really that bad (Dimercurio gives the Islamic crewmen a conscience that's reviled by the suffering they're about to unleash).  The book is pretty short on surprises (including an ocean map that charts the course of all subs in the book).  The biggest flaw of the book is that it's not really about anybody, so with all of the action going on, we never really know who we're supposed to pay attention to or care about.  Though Pacino is supposed to be the hero, the guy Dimercurio really should have headlined was Kane.  With his less than stellar credentials and his creaky old submarine, Kane's life expectancy is excitingly low, and the story does place a lot of emphasis on him, without ever showing it cares about what's going through his mind.  Dimercurio introduces his characters with a fairly detailed description (unlike Dale Brown, he manages to keep this from interrupting the action) that never otherwise affects how they act or interrlate throughout the rest of the book (Kane's insecurity allows his XO to become a rival figure on the boat, an intriguing idea that disappears once they confront Hegira).<br />On the plus side, \\"Phoenix\\" survives its implausible premise, and the action guarantees that you won't put it down half-finished.  The technology of military subs is too complex to be satisfyingly synthesized for landlubbers like us, so Dimercurio does a bang-up job making it as clear as he does and further by conveying the tension each crew faces despite the techno-speak.  The compact plot keeps your attentions even if it makes clear why we won't have a sub-thriller as enjoyable as \\"Red October\\" or \\"Sink the Potemkin\\".	2003-02-10
US	49374774	R2KS5U08P2YU1S	044020447X	939043812	Final Flight	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Great sequel to "Flight of the Intruder"	This was Coonts's first sequel to the unmatched \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", bringing Jake Grafton back (for the first and - it seemed in '88 when this book came out - last time).  While \\"Intruder\\" took place during the Vietnam war, \\"Final\\" has \\"Cool-Hand\\" Grafton flying F-14 Tomcats in our times.  Though nearly court-martialed at the end of the older book, \\"Final\\" starts off years later with Grafton on the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier \\"United States\\", having achieved the vaunted position of \\"CAG\\" - air-wing commander, and the highest ranking aviator a board.   (In \\"Intruder\\", Grafton deliberately attacked an unauthorized, politically sensitive target; though Grafton's career appeared doomed, President Nixon indirectly spared him when he authorized the \\"Christmas Offensive\\", and the brass realized that they couldn't very well court-martial a gung-ho fighter pilot for striking back at the Vietnamese when the President declares an all-out air offensive.)  Grafton's job as CAG is frustrated by the degree of bureaucracy that stands between him and getting his job done.      Unfortunately, this isn't helped by his ship's position in the Med, where it attracts the attentions of a sinister arab mastermind, Col. Quazi.  Owing his services to a fanatic arab leader with whom he is at odds, Quazi nevertheless plans and executes a daring and bloody infiltration of Grafton's carrier, with an eye towards its \\"special\\" weapons (okay, its nukes!  At the time, the USN's policy was to neither confirm nor deny the existence of nuclear weapons on any of its ships; given that the \\"United States\\" is a huge and modern aircraft carrier, Quazi figures his chances of spotting nukes aboard make it worth a shot).    This was a great book, one that turned technothrillers on their head, even if it wasn't as much fun as \\"Intruder\\".  For one thing, virtually none of the characters that made the older book fun return (like the boisterous and snobby \\"Razor\\", the craven \\"Rabbit\\" Wilson or the nobleand demanding Camparelli; \\"Tiger\\" Cole, Grafton's old navigator, doesn't return and his replacement here, \\"Toad\\" Tarkington doesn't quite fill Tiger's shoes; \\"Cowboy\\" is back, but more on him later), and much of the priceless repartee that Coonts gave his fliers in \\"Intruder\\" is absent here.  Grafton, who was a very approachable character in the older book is more remote here - owing to both his higher rank (fewer people can talk to him one-on-one) and the complex plot involving terrorists which keeps Grafton from becoming a character central to the book.  Coonts seems deliberately dead serious, but he handles it well.  Coonts also manages to save the day without relying on the typical technothriller stand-bys: instead of special forces or expert analysts or the heroic and hunky operative, Coonts has the day saved by the embattled sailors of the USS United States - working class stiffs led into battle by their grizzled chiefs.  When the gravity of the crisis hits Washington, Coonts manages to avoid creating the typical scene in which the planners and generals are already gathered in front of some situation room in the Pentagon, guaging the situation from countless computer screens (instead, Grafton and company have to conference the situation over the phone with an assistant SecDef, one who ofcourse orders Grafton NOT to fly off into battle).  Technothriller authors often insist that their plots are \\"frighteningly plausible\\", but Coonts uniqely succeeds here: he embraces the chaos that eludes other writers enamored or addicted to plots in which hi-tech and brilliant heroes will save the day in the end.  If \\"Final\\" has one big flaw, it's the arabs - not that their evil, just boring.  The plot works at Quazi's reluctance to make his master a nuclear power, but doesn't work that hard at it.  Still a worthy read, and one of the great technothrillers suffering only in having been eclipsed by \\"Intruder\\".	2003-01-30

In \\"Crossfire\\", a clique of distaff Soviets are hoping to pay there way out of the chaos that is the \\"Former Soviet Union\\" using a stolen cache of Iranian gold.  That's right, another story about fanatic and backward Soviets who don't know the meaning of the words \\"we lost the cold-war!\\"  First, for reasons that aren't immediately clear (that's putting it mildly - very little becomes clear in \\"Crossfire\\") these post-Soviet baddies must ice a retired CIA operative named Kirk McGarvey, Hagberg's hero.  Although Hagberg's Russians kill with little compunction, McGarvey's death requires irony, and his downfall begins with the Russians framing him for the bombing of the US Embassy in Paris.  Now on the run from just about everybody, McGarvey hooks up with a beautiful woman and decides to track down the conspiracy, which now includes a homicidal Ukranian named Kurshin, a man thought dead since McGarvey thew him into the Mediterranean.  Luckily for Kirk, Kurshin is gunning for him as well (that is that Kirk won't have to look that far; \\"far\\" being a relative word, considering that this is the sort of novel that bills itself as an international thriller \\"From Paris to Rio - Washington to Tehran!\\".  At least McGarvey can rack up frequent flier miles)  In South America, McGarvey tangles with more hired guns as he investigates a sunken U-Boat possibly loaded with Nazi gold. Kurshin, never far behind, cleans up any characters McGarvey allows to live.  Some Israelis show up but, appearing in the parts of the book dealing with sunken Nazis, they are the sort of wise and kind (comparatively) Mossad agents who only use espionage to cleanse the world of the evil of the Holocaust; the badass Mossad agents thought employed against Israel's mideast enemies never appear.    With little resolved or explained, the novel shifts to Iran and a shipment of gold that once belonged to the Shah that the US decides to return to Iran.  Knowing of the bullion delivery, the evil post-Soviets decide to make a grab for it themselves in an operation that looks doomed from the start (using strategic bombers that need long runways, they'll swoop down in the desert and just haul the gold away.  Yeah, that can happen).    Everything in this novel is either unnecessarily complicated or simply suspends your belief.  Nothing in the plot even remotely suggests why anybody could believe McGarvey would want to bomb our embassy.  Worse - just wondering about whether McGarvey could be the kind of guy to commit wholesale \\"collateral damage\\" will bring you to the unsettling realization that McGarvey, for his exploits, is a boring guy - he's like Bond, without the expensive tastes, hot women, gadgets or one-liners.  Then there's Kurshin, who seems addicted to killing people - early on, he warms himself by contemplating McGarvey's murder.  Unfortunately, like McGarvey, Kurshin is also a bore - murder is basically all he does.  He kills those who happen to cross his path while following McGarvey, he kills participants in his schemes once they've outlived there usefulness; he even kills the poor slob who has to drag the Ukranian across the desert after their big scheme fails.  He's like the masked killer in any of those teen-slasher pics (and this book is pretty hefty proof that the spy-thriller really needs a shot of the self-parody treatment that we got in \\"Scream\\").  \\"Crossfire\\" would be bad enough if it didn't recall another book Hagberg wrote under his Sean Flannery alias - \\"Kilo Option\\".  Like \\"Cross\\", \\"Kilo\\" involved plenty of explosions, a hunky and resourceful hero, baddies with an unnecessarily complicated scheme, an over-written but under-developed plot, Iranians who are either good or evil depending on how religious they are, and (most annoying of all) a psychotic Ukranian who kills according to compulsion, and can't be killed himself - this one named \\"Yernin\\".  (see thedifference?)  Even Kurshin's getting tossed into the Mediterranean by McGarvey in a prior book hints at Yernin's fate at the end of \\"Kilo\\".  What's the point of having a pen name if you write esentially identical books under both names?    Above all of the book's other flaws is this one - there really is no plot, no story that explains or links the pointless slaughter perpetrated throughout the book.  Since \\"Crossfire\\" is obviously part of some larger series that will pit McGarvey against Yernin (sorry, I meant Kurshin), I can forgive its reference to other books for needed plot devices.  But that doesn't explain how this book lacks a true beginning, middle and end.  I mean, how did Hagberg know where to start and end this tedious book?  In short, keep out of this \\"Crossfire\\".	2003-01-16
US	49374774	R1US2LOI507JKP	0061005827	83514678	Lion's Run	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Great Craig Thomas novel	\\"Lion's Run\\" (published in the UK as \\"Bear's Tears\\") concerns the sudden reversal suffered by British Intelligence Chief Kenneth Aubrey.  A stalwart presence in the anglo-Intel community (and perrenial hero in many Craig Thomas novels) Aubrey is revealed in \\"Run\\" to have been working for the Russians, perhaps going all the way back to his capture in the Soviet sector of Germany just after the war.  The revelation is compounded by the fact that the British were about to radically revamp and centralize their operations.  Aubrey's disclosure comes amidst his efforts to get a high-ranking KGB agent to defect.  Aubrey learns too late that the planned defection was a trap, meant to lure the British spy-chief close enough to the Russians to corroborate the suspicions about him.  Unfortunately, Aubrey's manipulated disgrace is only part of the plan that will see him kidnapped away to Russia (everybody will assume he just defected) and see the actual mole take command in his place.  Aubrey's only hope is Patrick Hyde, the Australian former SAS officer who seems capable of just about anything (but not capable of doing anything painlessly - Hyde is no Bond).  Unfortunately, Hyde will need to sneak into a Soviet intelligence stronghold in Czechoslovakia and access a secret computer for the files that will exonerate his boss.  However, Hyde will first journey to the killing fields Afghanistan.  There he will find the Russian general Petrunin, the one man who knows how to access the \\"Teardrop\\" files, and possibly the one man above every other on Earth who wants to Kill Hyde.<br />\\"Lion's Run\\" is another great Thomas novel.  It's chock full of the characters who intermittently recur throughout his other novels, but Thomas's prose and feel for his characters never alienate unfamiliar readers, and seem to welcome everybody.  (I would still recommend starting off with \\"Firefox\\" or \\"Snow Falcon\\")  Thomas seems to fit in a comfortable yet sparsely populated niche combining heady Bond thrills with the more cerebral quality of Deighton. Aubrey knows that he's innocent, but Thomas hints that the veteran spy-chief has some secrets he can barely face himself.  Thomas also deftly probes the pressures and ambitions of the Russians, restless on the verge of achieving a double-intelligence coup (kidnapping Aubrey while maneuvering one of their own into the inner-circle of British Intelligence), and the inner shame of Petrunin, whose assignment to Afghanistan may work against his masters.  At the same time, we have Hyde braving the snowy no-mans-land of the Hindu-Kush, and then his mad-dash across the wall to the east and back.  Of course, Aubrey and crew will have to deal with both the Russians and their own countrymen who are assured of Aubrey's guilt.  There are some gaps - though Thomas has delved too deeply into Aubrey before too leave any doubt as to his loyalty, he taunts us with hints that Aubrey does have something to hide.  But that's not handled as well as it could have been.  Also, Hyde's character seldom demonstrates the depth of the others - unlike ex-para Richard Anderson (\\"A Hooded Crow\\") or Mitchel Gant (\\"Firefox\\").  Still a great novel, with thrills down to the last page.	2003-01-06
US	49374774	RNS28AQGNA8NS	0553293117	498201600	Lucky's Bridge	Books	2	1	4	N	N	poor tribute to Thud drivers	\\"Lucky's Bridge\\" follows a fictitious F-105 squadron flying missions over the most dangerous skies of North Vietnam. Not a thin book, \\"Bridge\\" is still nevertheless incomplete - being part of a series and often referring to a wealth of details that could only have occurred in another book, while all plot lines will need another book to wrap up. <br />In \\"Bridge\\" the strategic bridges of the communist North are targeted for destruction by the USAF. Unfortunately, existing weapons and tactic - despite the heroism and expertise of the pilots - aren't up to the task. Back in America, a special team struggles to develop the first generation of smart-bombs before their superiors will give up and bar fighter pilots from attacking targets the bombs were meant to slam. Back in Vietnam (actually Thailand, where F-105 pilots were based), Lucky leads his men into battle with the weapons he's got. In Saigon, a fighter-pilot-friendly general faces two struggles: hit the bridges the North uses to supply guerillas in the south while ferreting out a turncoat on his own staff who passes secrets to the enemy. Lucky's men include Billy Bowes, a fearless young ace who can put his bombs anywhere he wants, but sometimes wants them to land on restricted targets; Manny Devera, another expert flier suffering from self-doubt; and worst of all, Tom Lyons, martinet and coward (i.e., a creep) transferred from Saigon (the Major Frank Burns of the book). <br />This is not the worst book I've read about air combat in Vietnam, but it's still horrible.  It's obviously part of a larger series of books - and despite some interesting plot-lines (a prolonged escape&evasion of a shot-down pilot; Devera's confidence problem; Bowes illegal attacks; the technical problems facing the smart-bomb team; the hazards faced by the smart-bomb-less F-105 drivers) the book never comes together to be anything more than a collection of episodes of fighter pilots.  People who claim to love this book likely hail its realism and how it makes you feel like you're in the cockpit, but \\"Bridge\\" doesn't begin to make you feel that way: while a lot of the story is spent in F-105's, the narrative jumps from plane to plane, seldom focusing on what's going on in any one of them (as Coonts had in \\"Intruder\\"), or even give you an idea of what it's like to fly one of those monsters. Wilson commits only a brief span of any one mission to paper, maybe thinking that we've already read about everything else in other books, so why bother? This robs his characters the chance to show what good pilots they are (and how they became that way) for more than a few minutes at a time. Not even the guys developing the smart-bombs get a chance to show their stuff in flight - we hear about their tests after the fact. Instead, too much of the book - in the longest, most consistent plot-line - is spent convincing us that Tom Lyons is a creep (he's vain, he's too much of a coward to fly dangerous missions, he pulls rank  mercilessly, persecutes everybody, cheats on his wife, can't keep a real woman, and, conveniently for the rest of us, holds completely inept views on the subject of tactical aviation).  While Lyons is the villain of the story (all without firing a shot) Bowes is hero.  The story gives cursory attention to whether Bowes should be canonized or court-martialed for striking at unauthorized targets.  Less vague is what happens when another pilot gets tagged for Bowes handiwork (by Lyons, of course): Bowes never once thinks of taking responsibility for the attacks given that they are now not only as illegal as they had been, but will now be used against a fellow pilot.  That subplot is ironic given the controversy over the insanely restrictive rules of engagement in Vietnam - they were bad because they put the safety of pilots at risk for a few meaningless targets.  However, when Bowes actually has the chance to put another pilot's career before his own (for Bowes own actions no less), Bowes stays quiet.This is forgetting how out of place the ROE issue is here - the Bridges (and MiG airfield) hit in \\"Bridge\\" weren't worthless targets as targets go - directly connected to supplying the Viet Cong. Lackluster tactics and technology, almost as much as politics are responsible here). <br />In short, \\"Bridge\\" is over-long and under plotted, deriving too little from the dynamics of the air war than from its own wildly implausible characters. If realism is what you need, read a real book like \\"Thud Ridge\\" by Jack Broughton instead.	2003-01-05
US	49374774	R1L46KX3RGJWWM	0962057010	133639258	An Alien Harvest: Further Evidence Linking Animal Mutilations and Human Abductions to Alien Life Forms	Books	3	16	29	N	N	Mute evidence	Linda Moulton Howe was SW America-area reporter when the cattle-mutilation craze hit.  Occurring over the period of 10 years beginning with the end of the war in Vietnam and petering out by Reagan's 2nd term, the cattle-mutilation epidemic filled the news media with reports of mysteriously killed and mutilated cattle.  Not only was the prairies dotted with dead cows, but certain parts had been removed with allegedly artificial preceision, while the blood was either gone or mysteriously diluted.  Who (or what) was behind the killing/mutilations, and just why they were dotting the SW with cut-up carcasses (and whether these deaths and the mutilations themselves weren't really the work of normal predators whose handiwork was distorted by mass media and mass hysteria) are just a the basic mysteries underlying the craze.  The three prime suspects for the epidemic (again, assuming that there was an epidemic to be caused) were the government (your friendly military-industrial complex, working day and night on cutting-edge bio-warfare technology; today we'd say it was corporate-level conspiracy), satanists (they're devious and dark, but can't afford their own cattle) and aliens (they've come 10 billion light years to experiment on us, but always forget to clean up their trash!).  Linda Moulton Howe falls into that group that's chosen the latter.  Now I'm not going to try and debunk the idea of intelligent extra-terrestrial life visiting Earth, or even joke about how oxymoronic it is for intelligent life to visit Earth, but I can never get past the cheat that underlies any ties between UFO theory and just about anything else here on Earth - it's a cheat because it's too easy!  Since aliens are, by definition, unknown to us, they're vague, amorphous, and can suit any theory.  (They're experimenting on cows to prepare bio-waepons against us; they're preparing new technology to help us; they're conspiring with the government; they work in secret to avoid the government.)  UFO'sare easy culprits once the process of elimination has removed any plausible motive or opportunity that links the offense to humans.  UFO's may sell more papers, but most of those are tabloids; if somebody could tie the phenomenon to a big corporate perp like Dow, and especially in these post-ENRon days, that would totally beat anything the UFO-conspiracy theorists could think up.  The usual explanations seem a tad to convenient: cows are being experimented on because their physiologies are so close to our own - but the same could be said for rodents and other small animals used in testing everything from pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to bio-warfare.  Also, there's no explanation for why the animals are left out in the open by these advanced aliens.  That's not only sloppy but - should the aliens decide to remove other animals form the same herd - a guarantee that the newer harvested cows could be contaminated by exposure to cows already experimented on.<br />There's nothing particularly wrong \\"Alien Harvest\\" that isn't wrong with similar work - it's compelling, but again relies on that same willingness to summarily accept theories that aren't solidly established and then jump to aliens as the only reasonable cause.  The story conspicuously lacks objectivity, with the authors having little question of their beliefs.  Instead of \\"Harvest\\", I'd recommend \\"Mute Evidence\\" by Kagan & Summer, a comprehensive survey and investigation of both the mutilation craze and the sub-culture it spawned.  \\"Evidence\\" actually details Moulton Howe's ascension to the UFO community, and manages to avoid the expected condescension when detailing why it remains on the fringe.	2002-12-15
US	49374774	R1TO2N9GCIKBAM	0425162605	309583796	Fatal Terrain	Books	1	4	7	N	N	Repetitive and unconvincing	\\"Fatal Terrain\\" refers to one of the many theories on war espoused by Sun-Tzu, a clue that Dale Brown's latest novel is aimed at communist China (Brown's books dwell on the same characters in a loose series that seems to shift between eastern Europe, the far east and Iran).  In \\"Fatal\\", Beijing is moved to take a stab at conquering Taiwan again (called Formosa Dao) by a fiery Admiral Sun - who isn't so much a fiery communist as he is military minded.  Ceaselessly quoting Sun-Tzu for a cadre of top-ranking red Chinese (who speak in the same stilted pseudo-language that all foreigners speak in technothrillers), Admiral Sun whips the moribund Chinese military into shape.  PLAN ships and PLAAF planes arrayed with the latest hardware, and upgraded missiles lay waste to Taiwan, while the Americans are paralyzed by liberals, bureaucrats and - because the USAF is the only service capable of readily meeting the threat - practically crippled by the craven Navy Admiral Balboa.  To meet the threat, the Americans rely on the covert help of Brad Eliot and his Dreamland team.  Recycled from previous Brown books, Eliot is reviled as a man who doesn't play by the rules and won't let bureaucrats, liberals or the Navy get between him and the mission (okay, we're not really supposed to hate the guy, we're supposed to root for a guy who won't be a team player when the team is staffed with morons).  With his souped-up B-52, the \\"Megafortress\\", he starts a secret war against the Chinese.  Unfortunately, not all the high-tech on the planet can match the Chinese in terms of numbers or media-manipulation.  First gamely assisting his mentor, hero AF ace Pat McLanahan comes to realize that Eliot may at last be going too far...even for him.  When the Chinese trick Eliot into sinking a ferry loaded with innocent civilians, Balboa colludes with a liberal left-coast politician (an uninspired caricature of Diane Feinstein) to cut the Megafortress team off in the Pacific.  Now wanted by just about everybody, Eliot's team hooks up with the remnants of Taiwan's besieged military before the PRC launches its last attack.<br />This has to be one of Brown's weaker books because, rather than being too military minded, it doesn't stay true enough to time-tested military traditions.  The real Sun-Tzu would have to fault Brown for committing the cardinal sin of war - repetition. Brown's plots normally follow a pretty rigid formula - geopolitical crisis coincides with the development of some fancy new weapons-system (\\"Flight of the Old Dog\\" set the pattern; \\"Day of the Cheetah\\" broke free of the pattern, making it one of Brown's more re-readable books); our nifty gadgetry could force the world to embrace peace, but political hacks, bureaucrats, backbiters, liberals and services other than the USAF conspire to make us fight with one hand behind our backs; our heroes won't play by the rules (that's why we love them, right?); the forces of evil are led by an outright psychotic or zealot (because rational characters and plots require more development); and the stage is set for what promises to be some awe-inspiring climax involving billions of dollars of high-technology burning up the stratosphere (but instead boils down to guys looking at computer screens and pushing lots of buttons).  Coonts would never impose on real pilots the repetitive and fatally predictable plots that recur through most of his books.  Instead of \\"Sun-Tzu\\", the insidious Admiral Sun should have picked up a copy of \\"Warrior Class\\" or \\"Shadows of Steel\\" - he'd know exactly where to expect the Megafortress, no matter how small its radar cross section. (And if you don't know what the importance of \\"radar cross section\\" is, or simply don't understand it, you've got no business reading any of these books; though his plots involve characters flying along a knife-edge of death, Brown's writing is safe within the technothriller genere and takes no chances that might ensnare readers who would never have otherwised picked up a book starring a warplane, with its crew in supporting roles).<br />Brown also ignores the Red Baron's famous warning - the quality of the man at the controls is never less important than the quality of the crate he flies.  Nevertheless, though Brown lards his pages with high-tech jets, the quality of his crates can't outfly his uninspired prose, unbelievable dialog, silly politics and an unbelievably anti-climactic end.  Also, since Brown generously grants a fair amount of high-tech to the enemy, the technological gap between good guys and villains remains static throughout the books.  Lastly, since much of the technology goes to computers and sensors, Brown's fancy planes are boiled down to nothing more than blips on perspex screens, which makes his battle scenes read like extended bouts of \\"Pong\\".  <br />Lastly, disagreeing with another reviewer, I think Brown's flight scenes - both in and out of the cockpit - are horrible.  Brown never orients what his planes do to the human characters who fly them - even though situational awareness is a major factor of combat aviation.  On the inside of their planes, Brown's characters alternate between spitting out at each other unintelligible battle language on the one hand, and on the other, carry on long conversations meant to advance the plot, but actually make us forget that those debating the dangers of Chinese military adventurism into the South China Sea are doing so while flying high performance aircraft in unfriendly skies, where an attack is always imminent.  (I kept waiting for somebody to say \\"but when you look at market reforms by high-level leadership in - ohmigod, break left, SAM launch!!!\\" but kept waiting.)  By now I'm willing to credit Brown with forgetting more about high-tech hardware than I'll ever know, but I'd be willing to accept less if he applied to his writing some of honest tactics that pilots have remained true to since the dawn of military flight.	2002-12-04

Essentially, this is an anthology loosely linked by a wrap-around story involving the titular \\"Illustrated Man\\".  A carnival worker laid up by a broken limb, he decided to get fully tatooed in order to get another job.  Unfortunately, the artist who turns our hero into a walking canvas is something of a witch.  It's peak season for carnivals when, on a later summer afternoon, he meets our narrator.  <br />..... and there doesn't seem to be a carnival in America that will hire him.  His tattoos become living stories when stared at by customers.  With spaceships, monsters and other oddities covering every inch of his body, he has become an unwitting page on which Bradbury writes his awesome stories.  (None of the fictitious carnival-goers care for the stories since, we're told by the Illustrated Man himself, they all end with the viewer's horrible death).  As night falls, the illustrations come alive, and the narrator comes to see tales of:<br />- astronauts forced to confront their doom as they drift in space after their spaceship suddenly explodes (years later, this would be parodied in the movie \\"DarkStar\\".)<br />- a living city built by a race of aliens annihilated by Earthlings and unwittingly discovered by exploring humans;<br />- Human explorers seeking their outpost on Venus where it never stops raining (this was a strangely prophetic take on Vietnam, right down to references to congressional funding for additional outposts)<br />- A mother and son driven to desperation by the occupational hazards of the husband's/father's job as a rocket pilot;<br />- A community of African Americans driven to colonize Mars in an effort to escape earthbound prosecutions now confronts survivors of Earth's last great war;<br />- Tourists who are really refugees from an oppressive future and will do anything to keep from having to back (or forth I guess);<br />- A family in a future age in which artificial intelligence and virtual reality affect almost every aspect of their daily existence (\\"The Veldt\\"; this cautionary and visionary tale of AI and VR run amok seems to have provided the basis for far too many episodes of ST:TNG, none of which have come close to matching its subversive quality.)  <br />And other tales of exotic aliens, distant planets, rocket ships and the end of the world.  This is what science fiction sounds like when your characters can't mask what's going on with meaningless techno-babble.	2002-11-26

In the book (which follows Ed \\"Rich\\" Richardson throughout his career in the early days of WWII, rather than on a single cruise), Rich avenges himself on \\"Bungo Pete\\", a near-mythical IJN officer whose mastery of the science of subhunting has dearly cost the USN.  one of the victims is Jim Bledsoe (played by Burt Lancaster in the film, but otherwise sharing no resemblence to Beach's creation)  \\"Run\\" ends with Richardson executing the crew of Pete's ship - presumbly including Pete himself, knowing that Pete will remain a danger as long as he's alive.  \\"Dust\\" opens where \\"Run\\" left off - with Rich returning to Pearl, with conflicting emotions over the morality of his act.  It's the inner moral dilemma that haunts Rich throughout the book, even as the story - which returns Rich to the battle-waters of the South Pacific - has little to do with it.  Instead, in \\"Dust\\", Rich has his ship essentially commandeered by his commodore and joined to others in an experiment in \\"wolfpacking\\" the Japanese.  Rich's superior quickly shows signs that he's got his own problems, but Rich's demons (which also include a burgeoning love for Jim Bledsoe's widow even as he romances another woman in Hawaii, a lapse that will come back to Haunt Rich in \\"Cold is the Sea\\".) prevent him from thinking or acting forcefully against the commodore.  There's a gratuitous subplot involving Rich's capture by a brutal Japanese naval commander on a lower order than Bungo Pete - it doesn't do much for the plot, while the character's unrelieved meanness makes it clear that the story needed some idiot to kick around.  Getting back to the war, Beach artfully and magnificently mixes on-board intrigue with the sea battle going on around Rich's sub.  Beach's flaws (characters are on the whole just decent people, making the imperfect ones look unnneccessarily unlikable; rather than dialog, Beach has his characters speak in large, unbroken paragraphs, so instead of conversations, Beach's officers engage in miniature briefings; that made sense in \\"Run\\" which had a first person narrative, but doesn't work in \\"Dust\\" which reverts to 3rd person) are outbalanced by his expertise, even for those unfamiliar with the science of submarine warfare, and easily so for those who know a thing or two.	2002-11-14
US	49374774	R13SR3204DQBX3	0525630147	576291739	The brink	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Uncommon naval aviation story	\\"The Brink\\" follows the trials and triumphs (mostly trials) of a young naval aviator during the Quemoy-Matsu Crisis of 1958.  Prior to the sino-soviet split, the Red Chinese threatened to invade the Nationalist held islands, with Russian nuclear weaponry holding the US forces back from a preemptive attack on the PRC.  Instead, US Navy fighters armed with \\"special weapons\\" zoom near the critical lines at 1300 mph.  Between their distance from home, their own meager resources and the rigors of naval aviation, the pilots of our hero's squadron are whittled to the bone.  The main character, who writes in first person, isn't even a very good pilot (unfortunately, he never gets a chance to show his stuff in combat ) instead, the elements and the tricky aspects of flying planes from aircraft carriers put him to the test.  If not a peerless warrior, he at least displays a supernatural capacity for survival, even as other planes crash into the sea on aborted carrier landings (\\"bolters\\") or simply vanish.  The squadron commander, a scarred warrior (literally: he's got a fake lower-leg and you almost never hear him talk) has no choice but to keep him around, knowing that the narrator is essentially all they've got.<br />\\"The Brink\\" is an old book, but obviously one that hasn't made a dent the way \\"Flight of the Intruder\\" has, which is a shame.  The hero's sense of self-deprecation is light, but strong enough to keep him from being one of those action figures who populate other military aviation novels.  In fact, it's refreshing to read an aviation novel that stays focused on one person (most are about a host of people, few of whom become convincing characters).  It's an extreme that perhaps goes a bit far (it would have been nice if he did have some friends, something to broaden our horizons; instead, the narrator's solitude gives the rest of us chronic tunnel vision).  Also, it would have been great if he could have given us some sense of what it's like to actually fly the mighty F-8 Crusader, one of the legendary machines in the history of air warfare.  Also, although the author adequately describes the underlying global situation, it never manages to connect that with the desperation of the round-the-clock ops suffered by the pilots here - any chronic shortages in men or aircraft coinciding with an even less-than-earth shattering situation would probably result in US military units being put in high-tension, low-margin-for-error operations in which planes and the men who flew them would be stretched to the breaking point.  Setlowe misses a great chance to elevate the crisis to one of WWIII proportions by having our hero have to deal with the nuclear weapons he may be forced to fly with.  Instead, the nukes remain shadowy Mcguffins - objects whose presence is more felt than realized.  Also, the end is a bit of a cop out.  (We all know that the Quemoy-Matsu crisis ended in anti-climax, but couldn't the author have given us something less pat than what he ends the book on?)  All in all, a great book nonetheless, one guaranteed to make you feel as if you had been standing on the deck of a steaming carrier, with salt spray from the Sea of China blowing at you.	2002-11-14

(Sawyer's mother, an aging B-movie queen in our world, is an actual queen named Laura Deloessian on a storybook earth called \\"the territories\\")  \\"Black House\\" returns us the character, now an older, financially secure and famous retired homicide detective inexplicably relocated to a picturesque but quiet Wisconsin town called \\"French Landing\\".   (The move seems incredible given how the narrators spend so much of the books opening painting a detailed but unfavorable impression of it).  Sawyer's completely forgotten about his past adventures, finding enough dark evil in our mundane world.  In \\"House\\", the quiet life of French Landing is shattered when the town's children become targeted by an horrific serial killer dubbed \\"The Fisherman\\".  Despite help from the state police and vigilante aspects of the town's police, the Fisherman runs amok.  Sawyer is reluctantly brought into the case.  Unlike \\"Talisman\\" (whose magic still blesses Sawyer) \\"House\\" spends much time building up the characters who populate the town (\\"Talisman\\" was more of a road-novel), both friendly and otherwise.  We meet the flustered police chief; a blind DJ with more alter-egos than a room full of superheroes; a housewife who shares Sawyer's affinity for alternate worlds; the corrupt manager of a rest home; a seemingly senescent resident of the home; an obnoxious local reporter/creep and a gang of hyper intelligent bikers - but Sawyer is the story's focus.  As he delves into the case, Sawyer's memories of the Territories slowly and painfully re-awaken, and he learns of a tie between the Fisherman murders and an imprisoned cross-dimensional monster who threatens to escape his multi-versal cell, and also discovers that the children themselves possess a latent power making them very desirable to the dark lord.<br />This was an incredibly disappointing novel - I don't care how many Amazon.com reviewers loved it.  In every way this book insults your intelligence and commits the most cardinal sin of all for a horror novel: it's not remotely scary.  Instead of being scary characters, King/Straub's are just very unpleasant - there's little definition to the human serial killer, once he's unceremoniously revealed as such - we learn more about his hygiene than his connection to the otherworldly evil terrorizing French Landing.  Rather than scare us, the narrative works up our own prejudices.  As you'd suspect, the human killer is only a vessel for a more powerful force that, once actually confronted by our heroes, goes down without much of a fight.  Until Jack and his loyal followers get around to braving the \\"Black House\\" - a sort of nexus between the many parallel worlds - King/Straub focus our attentions on an outrageous creep of a reporter named Wendell Green who spares no indignity to grab the story or picture of the century.  (Green could have been a great plot device, but the authors relegate him to cheap comic relied - every time the creep gets on the verge of one-upping our hero, Jack turns the tables on him; rather than somebody who could become an instrument for the evil forces against Sawyer in our world, or at least implicate him for the Fisherman's crimes, Green is just the sort of convenient character kept around so we can feel comfy about dissing him)   Green is only one of the more obvious characters in this story that reveal how the authors have very definate ideas about who we're supposed to like, and not much interest in developing their characters (if you don't believe, skim to a page in which the town's nameless rabble converge on the scene of the Fisherman's latest victim, claiming their right to have a \\"keepsake\\" of the killer's reign of terror.  The authors do toss in some sympathetic characters, but doesn't do much to develop them either.  Though this is at least partly a Stephen King novel, much of the language seems less like his trademark terrifyingly funny prose than the treacly lines of Robert James Waller (Sawyer, like the hero of \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" is himself a character with a disdain for our world, and his creators can do no more to craft their romanticized other-world than show us how lame our own is).  Even the narrator - an unseen personage who tells us where to look - is a none-too clever cheat:  The authors create a separate character with its own point-of-view because they can't otherwise do the same for any of the book's other characters.  <br />The biggest cheat is how the book skims over the story we want to read - Jack discovering what the evil is, and journeying to its world to battle it.  Instead, Jack learns of the Evil from Parkus, a friend of Jack's from their days in the Talisman, and now an fellow law enforcer (or \\"coppicemen\\") in the Territories.  The \\"Black House\\" is unsurprisingly more of a challenge than anything you've seen on HGTV, but Jack and his band navigate it with surprising ease.  Because it's obvious that the authors couldn't work up much of a story with our leads, most of the book seems designed as a huge stalling tactic, designed to keep our heroes from attempting to enter the Black House that sits at the crossroads of many worlds - and ending the story.  The book ends on a complete cop-out - what the author's probably envisioned as a twist, but the rest of us would have seen from the first page (but doubted if only because it would have been incredibly trite).  Instead of \\"Black House\\", pick up \\"The Shining\\" or \\"Tommyknockers\\".	2002-11-11
US	49374774	R1FI77U0G46HLO	038071700X	760239321	First Air	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Incredibly uninspired technothriller	Fighter pilots from around the world, the best in each of their respective countries, are sent with their planes to shore up a middle estern country facing a soviet-backed invasion in \\"First Air\\".  When Bagdad gets nuked, things are bad enough.  When an inept Admiral (I guess the author was in the Air Force; like Dale Brown who navigated B-52's for SAC, Skinner's naval officers, fighter-drivers aside, are unsurprisingly dim) accidentally sinks a Russian cruiser (that supposed to be a warning shot!), a Russian reprisal further thins out the western presence in the Persian Gulf area.  A shady civilian analyst convinces different countries' air forces to lend both planes and aircrews, forging a hybrid force that contains American F-15's, German Tornadoes and, forgetting that we're in a middle eastern country, Israeli fighters as well.  Leading the pack is Bobby Dragon, a mythic fighter pilot last seen flying Phantoms in Vietnam.  Having spent the years since the war flying black jets out of Dreamland, Dragon is the obvious choice to send in.  On the other side, an obviously evil Russian ace with a vendetta against Dragon (facially disfigured after narrowly losing a dogfight against Dragon over Vietnam) engineers an ethnic uprising in Baluchistan that triggers the war.  With his MiG-29 fighters, he more than matches the firepower arrayed against him.  <br />This was a horrible book - the author spends so much time and crams in so many obscure and unnecessary details about military aviation, and wastes so much effort trying to convince his readers about what he knows that his writing never comes close to convincingly detail what it must be like to sit inside of a monster jet fighter.  Instead of concentrating on one of the characters, the narrative meanders between different fliers - the mythic Dragon, the \\"Weasel Twins\\" (a pair of electronics geniuses who appear to be the Steve Jobbs and Steve Wozniak of the military aviation community), the aged aircrew of a grizzled F-4 Phantom (they refused to transition to the \\"hated F-16\\") and a younger American who's determined to learn form dragon.  There is no plot development, and the characters are non-existent behind their facades as fighter pilots.  You don't have to write like Henry James to turn out at least a very decent technothriller.  Nothing else will grab you here - the war scenario in the mideast seems like the same thing you've seen in other books and countless flight simulator games.  The enemy is too thin to even rate being called \\"cardboard\\" - physically and morally scarred, with an agenda, weapons of mass destruction and the ear of corrupt Soviets, he's closer in consistency to that thin sheet stuff they put on overhead projectors.  Skinner took half of an interesting idea, and killed it.  The idea of a story about mercenary fighter pilots is cool because it avoids the trap of letting or forcing the author to swap the action we want for tired demonstrations of his experience with the bureaucratic nuts and bolts of an established air force.  However, the idea only works if the writer replaces the boring stuff with the action we want.  Also, since the story puts the mercenary pilots essentially in charge of themselves, we would have a unique opportunity to see what an air force would look like if it were run by the people who do the flying.  Skinner doesn't just flub on that score, he doesn't deal with it at all - the pilots never form a cohesive unit, they just fly.  Skinner's idea essentially takes all the boring guts out of your standard military aviation novel, and doesn't put replace it with anything.	2002-10-17
US	49374774	R1DE6J431O4J9G	0517562855	442743154	The Wild Blue: The Novel of the U.S. Air Force	Books	3	5	11	N	N	Expansive, but unneccessary	This single book purports to tell the story of three pilots who entered the USAF after its post-war break from the army, and rose to prominent positions by the post Vietnam years.  That's a lot of ground to cover (the \\"Eagles\\" novels also covered the postwar years, but stopped around the civil-rights era).  The Berlin airlift, Korea, Vietnam, the cutbacks of the 1970's, the shift in strategies from high-altitude to low altitude \\"penetration\\" -  all touch at least a few of the main characters, but don't touch for very long or go very deep.  The story keys on three characters - the working-class hero hero, his African-American friend and co-achiever (who exists seemingly as the hero's conscience, but also to remind the hero not to use him to push his northern liberal views on race on southern servicemen) and the hero's inevitable foil - the USAF brat who's not above using family connections to advance his own career or take some potshots at others.  Though hero and foil compete against each other in training, foil takes the upper hand when he opts against going to fly fighters in Korea.  Later during the golden-age of flight test, our hero's rival pushes his own pet project, a low-level fighter plane that can equip both navy and USAF units, and forces our hero to test it.  Characters make transitions back and forth (the rival's wife becomes an alcoholic frump, pulls herself togther, only to regress again, all in the space of a few paragraphs in which she's not otherwise an active participant; the hero becomes an alcoholic as well, if only to give him a flaw which he must vanquish).  Too much of what people in \\"Wild Blue\\" say comes offless as what people might have been thinking and more of what people today would say years later - it's easy to see in hindsight how the F-4 Phantom, a navy jet, could satisfy the need for a multi-role fighter for all services (it took two planes in each service to replace it entirely), but the extreme complexity, the maintenance nightmare and the revolutionary concept the plane empbodied would have made it an unlikely choice at the time.  Also, the novel straddles the line between history and fiction in the wrong places.  When Boyne gets to the airplane intended as the multi-service fighter, he pulls off a monumental cheat - in reality, the plane was the F-111, a tactical strike-fighter meant to fly from air force bases and aircraft carriers, and lamented in both roles.  While the F-111 eventually earned distinction in Desert Storm (by which time, technology caught up with the concept), it was an unpopular plane with USAF crews, and utterly rejected by the USN entirely.  In \\"Wild Blue\\", the plane is ignored entirely.  Instead, Boyne introduces a completely fictitious aircraft that coincidentally fills the same role, is tailored for high-speed automatic flight with a terrain-following radar, seats its aircrew the same way and, because it's as ahead of its time as the F-111 was, proves as buggy-prone as the real deal.  (This is similar to a fighter in Boyne's WWII entry in the Eagle's series, a fictitious plane that otherwise sounds exactly like the P-39).  I know that in historical novels, there's always a point at which the history gives way to the novel, and vice-versa, but the F-111 seems the poor place to draw the line.  The navy end of the F-111 controversy seems missed completely.  Although this is an air force book, the omission only clues us in to how the story leaves out the navy entirely, even though the story of each has significance for the other.  (It's like a Vietnam-war novel that has no Vietnamese characters at all).  Boyle also misses parts of the USAF story that I would have like to see covered - clashes between the USAF leadership and the president in general, but also some specific historical controversies - whether the B-36 should have won out both over Jack Northrop's flying wings and over the Navy's super-carriers as well, why there were no B-36's in Korea, whether anybody really considered using the bomb there and in Vietnam, and the controversy over manned bombers over missile.  (Controversy over the B-70 bomber, one of my favorite planes, was one of several foci between Curt LeMay and the Mcnamara era, yet the issue with its many related sub-issues never comes to light here; instead, a proposed supersonic bomber is sacrificed near the end of the book for political purposes - a story that closer approximates the Russian Backfire bomber than one of our own planes).  \\"Wild Blue\\" is meant to be an historical novel, but it's not only light on history but on the novel sidea as well.  Once we meet our characters, we already know what we're supposed to think of them - there's little plot development and few surprises, and since those who read the book already know enough about the subject matter, what's left to grab them?	2002-10-14
US	49374774	RWENG178T0ZNP	0517587904	473963912	Israel's Best Defense: The First Full Story of the Israeli Air Force	Books	3	8	8	N	N	Gets the facts right, but misses much of the story	This book tells the extended story of the Israeli Air Force, famed but also perhaps a sometime victim of its own rep. From its humble beginnings of foreign volunteers and Piper Cubs to the supersonic age of super-aces in F-16s, the IAF always possessed the veneer of the heroic.  Being the principal military branch for a young nation repeatedly beset by war, the IAF's story closely parallels the history of Israel - from the scrappy jury-rigged days of the war of independence, the disappointment of 1956, the near-miraculous triumphs of 1967, the tragic near reversal of 1973 and the painful realities of Lebanon. Though the IAF has come a long way since its humble beginnings, and its history covers half a century, the shift from a cobbled-together, volunteer-staffed air force to an elite-trained arm equipped with cutting edge aircraft was sudden - about the time the major European powers turned to Israel as a counter for the pan-arabism of Egypt's Nasser, leading up to the abortive Suez campaign. Most of the foreign volunteers had returned home by then, and the Spitifres that fought the Independence War put into storage. (Late model F-51 Mustangs, however, remained in service and flew missions against the Egyptians in 1956; though seeming contemporaries of the Spitfire, IAF's Mustang's are more identified with the '56 war, then the war of independence). Israeli pilots, traveling abroad (seemingly on vacation) were taught to fly unforgiving transonic jets like the French Mystere. The IAF had opened its own academy by then, and had already established its reputation for being unforgiving to its cadets. <br />Because it's almost impossible to separate the stories of Israel and her air force, the authors can't go that deep into the individual stories of the pilots or the various conflicts in which they serve. With so many stories, so many people and hardware, it's hard to become interested in any one of them. Sure, this wasn't meant to be an especially dramatic reading, butair combat, like drama, relies on perceptual powers of its participants.  In short, we get the stories - all of them - but have no human dimension in which to frame them.  We learn that the Avia S-99, a Czech copy of the famed Me-109 fighter of WWII, was about as dangerous to its pilots as its enemies, or that the supersonic Mirage III had a severe problem with its engine, one that would soon show reveal itself to its pilots.  We learn that Avi Lehnir flew too close to the MiG-21 he destroyed, and returned home covered in soot.  Because the book is only concerned with getting the facts right and utterly ignoring the impact of the events on those who lived them, it's hard to get a sense of what it must have been really like to fly one of those monsters, and, more importantly why the Israelis were much better at it than any of their enemies. In fact, the difference was lay in how the Israelis excelled in learning how to fly their aircraft in ways not envisaged by their designers - the drag of the big delta wing on the Mirage III made it unsuitable for flying low altitude, or in extended dogfights where it lost energy quickly; the F-4 Phantom was designed as an interceptor rather than a dogfighter. Nevertheless, the Israeli triumph in 1967 owed much to her pilots' ability to coax unknown agility out of the Mirage, and fly them well below Egyptian and Syrian radar; and, echoing the American experience in Vietnam, the Israelis discovered a master dogfighter in the F-4 as well. Missing is any sense of the people flying these planes or at least responsible for them. The enormous success of the IAF therefore remains a mystery, probably unintentional. By the end of the book, you've covered 50 explosive years of aviation history, and can't begin to explain a single thing you've read.	2002-10-14
US	49374774	R6SD59HWBCGLK	0880294906	56289942	The World's Worst Aircraft	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Do we really want another story about how great the F-16 is?	These planes are bad.  They've killed people and destroyed lives.  Not all of them were warplanes, and most of them were more dangerous to those who flew them anybody else.  That's right, these are the worst planes in history.<br />And it's a great read, not limiting itself to simplistic dismissals of airplane's that didn't measure up.  I mean, aviation lore is full of stories about the visionaries, the heroes and their great planes, but little to the more interesting stories of the losers, the hucksters and opportunists who saw a chance for a quick buck, or for the arrogant who thought they knew better - all of whom saddled others in the fatally flawed products of their imagination.  <br />From the heady days of aviation's infancy, through world wars and the cold war, Yenne takes no prisoners (or is \\"passengers\\" the correct word?).<br />If the book has a flaw, it is in the choice of airplanes targeted.  As in a similar book by James Gilbert, Yenne enshrines Brewster Buffalo as one of the worst (going after its makers as hucksters out for defense dollars at the cost of the lives of airmen equipped to fly the plane; Yenne also typifies the plane as the perfect answer to the west's arrogance against the Japanese - white male planners knew the Buffalo's deficiencies, but figured they could hold their own against Japanese planes which they arrogantly assumed would fly worse).  Though the Buffalo was cursed with horrifically poor performance against the Japanese (whose Zero had the best stats of the early war years, even outclassing the famed Spitfire), those sent to Finland performed superlatively.  <br />The Convair 880/990 weren't really bad planes, as Yenne aknowledges.  But the story behind it contains too much drama, history, poor judgement and bad luck to be ignored.  Supposedly built for Howard Hughes's TWA, the 880 was Convair's entry in the jet race run by Douglas and Boeing.  Stymied by Howard Hughes's bizarre whims, 880 development languished.  In trying to catch up, and pining their hopes on somehow exceeding the performance of the DC-8 and the 707, Convair unwisely skipped the prototype stage and went into production before working out the bugs.  When the 880 doesn't achieve the prize, Convair goes back and re-works the plane, bearing the 990.  In the end, neither plane achieves the promised performance, and the abbreviated production runs of either produce a few planes which are soldiering on, somehwere.  Including the 880/990 would have made more sense had its career been cut short by some horrific accident ala the Hindenburg (or the Dehavilland Comet, which does not get similar blame here), but Yenne confuses unsuccessful with undeserving.<br />The same goes for the F-20 Tigershark, Northrop's failed bid to design a new generation of high-performance/low cost fighter planes.  The Tigershark was the victim of poor circumstances - the slightly inferior but already existent F-16 already owned the market Northrop looked to exploit (one partly created by Northrop's F-5).  And when Yenne tosses in the B-2 as a future possible entrant (because of its astronomic cost, and the possibility that it may be too expensive to send into combat), it looks like he's going for the headlines.  The F-105 was also considered a costly mistake when it debuted - but try telling that to anybody who flew one in Vietnam.  And why doesn't the B-70 rate a mention?  Sure it was gorgeous, and it achieved its specs of triple sonic, high alititude flight, but its underlying mission proved so out of touch with contemproary technology of missiles and radar defenses designed to hunt and destroy high speed planes at high altitudes, that it's got to rate a mention.  (The author does fault the Bristol Brabazon for also being behind the times).<br />Still, even if you disagree with Yenne, since including planes means that he's got more stories to tell.  I mean, does anybody really want to hear more P-51 legends.	2002-10-01
US	49374774	RYIRG5ID3304E	034537536X	334108134	Show of Evil	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Whether legal thriller or mystery, more show than substance	\\"Show of Evil\\" is the sequel to the novel \\"Primal Fear\\".  In that first book, the morally ambiguous defense attorney Mart Vail saves from an almost certain conviction a young man who murders Chicago's archbishop.  In the face of an almost certain conviction, Vail managed to squeeze out an insanity plea based on the youthful defendant's split personality - normally he's the sweet and unassuming Aaron Stampler.  When aroused or angered, he becomes the cruel and sadistic Roy, neither one able to recall what happens when the other takes over.  At the end of \\"Primal\\" Vail is convinced that Aaron/Roy's disorder is invented - but by then, he's won and Aaron/Roy is institutionalized and immunized from prosecution.  \\"Show picks up 10 years later.  Vail is now Chicago's No. 2 prosecutor, the head of a gang of rapacious homicide ADA's who show no mercy.  While his office juggles two high-profile homicides, Vail is forced to confront the impending release of Aaron.  Hardly convinced as his doctors are that Aaron/Roy is cured (and has shed both previous egos for a new honest one named \\"Ray\\"), and learning of a string of copycat murders in which Aaron's former friends have become victims, Vail is determined to crack Aaron/Roy/Ray.  <br />This was a pretty shallow story - with Aaron barely making a dent in a plot that spends much of its time concerned with the two other murders being prosecuted by Vail's office.  The events of \\"Primal\\" mostly arise as a consequence of \\"Show\\"'s focusing on Vail's renewed romance with Jane Venable, the prosecutor in \\"Primal\\" and - to complete the reversal of roles here - the defense counsel in one of Vail's homicide cases.  (When the hints prove insufficient, Diehl just drops Aaron's name in spots of narrative that have nothing to do with the case).  Finding improbably close links between Aaron's handiwork and that of a serial killer who claims two of Aaron's former friends, Vail struggles to tie the murders to a man who's been institutionalized fora decade.  Diehl, like Aaron, doesn't know when to leave well-enough alone and, once Aaron returns to the novel, he quickly and unceremoniously spills the beans.  Suffice it to say that those looking for a real twist will go hungry (I thought Aaron, Venable and Vail would team up and implicate a high-level Chicago fixture much as they cooked the archbishop in \\"Primal\\", or otherwise link the copycat crimes to the other seemingly unrelated ones ala \\"Hollywood Confidential\\").  The mystery of Aaron's power to manipulate from beyond the walls of an insane asylum isn't even a mystery (although it might have been to some in 1993, only a couple of years before Netscape's legendary IPO).  Instead, \\"Show\\" is incredibly fake - everything from the ambitious and merciless ADA's who run Vail's office (as if the Cook County DA's Office existed to prosecute only a few homicides) to the pseudo-hardboiled dialog of his cops (\\"look, we ain't lookin' to cause the lady no grief.\\")  Even the setting seems unreal - Diehl's Chicago lacks the verisimilitude of the fictional Kindle County of the Turow novels.  That \\"Show\\" is supposed to be a mystery is undermined by how little detail Diehl gives us to work with.  (After the climax, Vail's team turns up details that explains everything - ala \\"Scooby Doo\\".  What really kills me is that this is supposed to be a legal thriller and, despite pumping us up to the legal talent available, very little of \\"Show\\" takes place in a courtroom, and Diehl's ADA's talk about \\"maxing out\\" the people they prosecute without doing much to prove they could prosecute a shoplift.  (The cops, on the other hand, are dismissed as inept apes, who parade the prisoners they collar like war-trophies, without much regard for their possible innocence.)  Had he taken the defendant in one of \\"Show\\"'s subplots to trial, Diehl could have substantiated his opinions about his prosecutors and his cops in one swoop, but that's obviously more effort than its worth.	2002-09-23

Knowing the consequences of a nuclear reprisal, he decides against nuclear retaliation...and surrenders.  Whoops - the salvo of Russian MIRV warheads is actually a meteor shower.  A report of a sub-launched nuke off the Atlantic coast is traced to a USAF computer which short-circuits when NORAD shifts to its own internal power.  Catching the mistake before a retaliatory strike by any American units not obeying the surrender (and also before the Soviets can get over their bafflement and accept the American concession), the US leadership has a bigger problem on its hands: is the President a hero who saved the world from nuclear holocaust, or a coward who committed high treason?  While the answer is obscured by politics, Washington takes steps to prosecute the President as the former.  The real questions persist.  Who is really to blame for what ultimately happened at zero hour?  And is there some last minute revelation that will decide the ultimate issue of cowardice or heroism?  Saltmaker's prose are actually light-handed on the subject.  For much of the book, you don't know exactly where the president stands, which only enhances the suspense.  \\"Saltmaker\\" may be that rare breed of book - the Political Thriller that actually thrills.	2002-09-15
US	49374774	R1X22IHPXR1CZ6	0345354621	376914649	The Terminal Man	Books	3	1	1	N	N	thin story	After suffering brain damage in a car accident, Harry Benson found himself prone to blackouts in which he violently assaults anybody unlucky enough to be near him.  Drs. Morris, Ellis and Macpherson - elite Psychiatric researchers at an LA area hospital, had already developed a unique form of treatment called \\"Stage 3\\" - implanting electrodes I into the damaged areas of Harry's brain, programmed to head off the electrical impulses that make Harry violent by stimulating them in advance.  Of course it doesn't work.  For one thing, the accuracy of the electrode placement and the revolutionary nature of the treatment means that small errors have major consequences.  Then there's Harry himself - a computer scientist specializing in artificial intelligence (this book was written around and set in 1971; had the phrase \\"cyberneticist\\" entered wide use by then?).  In every way, he realizes and warns, computers are outstripping mankind, and are taking over the world.  Actually, it means that there's an underlying logic to Harry's fits of violence.  When, after the surgery, Harry finds himself addicted to the stimulation (and he learns to supply that addiction with plenty of negative vibes), he breaks out of his hospital room (because he faced prosecution for at least one assault at the time of his operation, Harry was essentially a patient/prisoner), setting off a violent nightmare for the doctors who treated him.  Only Janet Ross, a psychiatrist who doubted the wisdom of Stage 3 and openly argued against Harry's selection for it (Harry's paranoia against artificial intelligence reflected an underlying behavioral problem independent of his specific neurological condition).  Harry is no helpless patient - his actions like the hospital escape show advanced planning - and the doctors responsible for turning him into a machine soon feel the brunt of his violence.<br />This was an especially thin book, showing how dated it is.  The story breaks down into the operation, the interface (when the doctors decide which electrodes will work, in response to what stimulus and how powerful, and then throw the switch) and the ominously titled \\"breakdown\\".)  It's a neat story but one that has few surprises.  This is especially a problem when the point of the story is that we're becoming a race of computerized people - but the main characters are already walking computers for the most part, devoid of much feeling or depth.  Only Harry's character, for his psychosis, really comes alive, and that isn't until after he's been wired.  Crichton has some other cool ideas - like the one about the brain originally being an extension of the nose: the idea of a the brain as a complex thinking mechanism governed by a sophisticated cerebral cortex is relatively new in human evolution, and when it's damaged, the shark brain kicks into gear.  This was light read, something I finished in two days.	2002-09-09

Andrew \\"Gio\\" Gioberti is still recovering from the freak death of his daughter.  In the wake of the car accident that took his daughter's life (he was the driver) Gio loses his wife, much of his financial security and begins losing both his legal expertise and his sanity.  We learn that Gio fatally botched his first homicide case on returning from condolence leave - allowing a murder suspect to testify in grand jury before waiving his immunity  (without that waiver, the perp's testimony immunizes him from prosecution).  Gio is now an alcoholic who uses and discards attractive female ADA's who, as a group, remain endlessly clueless to his exploitation of them.  When the story opens, Gio is investigating the homicide of a 14 year old girl, a single mother living with her sister and her crack-addicted mother.  The obvious culprit is Lamar Lamb, a small-time dealer who is already in custody in Brooklyn's notorious 75th precinct (the largest in NYC, and located in an area where even Beirut-born cab drivers fear to go.)  Nobody saw Lamb commit the act, only leave the apartment when the gun went off.  It's as good a case as anybody can expect without looking too deeply (but Lamb's own lawyer predicts a short trial and a long sentence).  On Lamb's side is Gio's shattered soul.  Everybody else - from the arresting detective to the victim's sister - point the finger at Lamb, but hint at her drug-ridden mother as the true culprit.  The stage is set for a legal batle...<br />...that never happens.  \\"Hollowpoint\\" is pretty hollow itself, centered around linking the murder Gio investigates at the outset, the case he botched in Grand Jury and the death of his daughter into a loose-fitting continuity that doesn't really hold.  To jazz things up, the author creates a hellish setting - of an aging and cockroach infested ruin in which the DA's office is housed, of detectives whose language is confined to 4-letter words, of menacing judges and lazy defense attorneys.  Gio also has a girlfriend, a newer ADA who's become wise to his womanizing, yet can't keep away from him.  Her sole mission - remind Gio what a jerk he is.  The author needs these effects to shore up a conspicuous lack of legal suspense - nothing goes to trial here, or even gets past the grand jury - and Gio spends less time being a lawyer than a man in serious need of one.  The legal details are pretty slim, deceptively camouflaged behind the daily mechanics of being an ADA - like getting your grand jury minutes to Supreme Court before some impatient judge decides to dismiss your indictment for laughs, or saying the words \\"the people are ready for trial\\" whenever you step inside of a courtroom.   The author also plumps up the story with expansive but empty dialog (\\"Oh,\\" is a frequent example; also, many characters respond to statements by rephrasing what they've just heard as a question).  Most annoying is the use of flashback - compulsively flitting between past and present and throwing in the possible future (as when Gio contemplates the apartment of a female ADA he's thinking of sleeping with).

Medusa is a bomb designed and built by a truly mad scientist.  Powered by a 20 megaton nuclear warhead, Medusa uses EMP to knock out virtually every microchip within a huge range of fire, and corrupt any data written near the time of the blast.  The former defense researcher/would be destroyer-of-worlds even programs the machine to heap abuse on his poor wife.  Completing his mysterious device before dying, he manages to cajole his poor former wife into delivering it (the unfortunate ex not knowing of its purpose) to the Pentagon.  Strapped into a 727 freighter flown by a former fighter driver named Scott Mackay, the device arms too quickly (flown over the Pentagon, Medusa's GPS sensors can't distinguish between being in the cellar of the Pentagon, from being 20,000 feet above it) triggering a computer which (having been programmed by a certifiably evil genius) details exactly what it will do.  Among other things, the computer also warns about a special safeguards meant to insure that his hated wife accompany the machine to its final debut (one of the device's sensors is keyed to her pacemaker).  Mackay now battles a freak hurricane and his own dwindling fuel supply to deep-six the bomb over the mid-Atlantic, setting off the sort of crisis response that insures that we'll see plenty of fighter jets, generals and powerful politicians in settings where they will be surrounded by high-tech.  But, at its heart \\"Medusa\\" excels because it's a very character driven book - the occupants of Mackay's stricken 727 form relationships that transcend what would otherwise be a straight-to-cable movie like \\"Pandora's Clock\\" or the one made of \\"Glass Cockpit\\". I've only read \\"Final Approach\\" and \\"Phoenix Rising\\" - this is the most human of the three.	2002-09-02

Told entirely from Molloy's POV, the story begins when Molloy is told by the three attorneys of the firm's executive committee that one of its partners - the brash and daring Bert Kamins - has disappeared along with over 5 million dollars of the firm's money.  The money was part of an escrow account set up to pay out a settlement in a class action suit brought against G&G's biggest client and stemming from a horrific airliner crash.  The fact of the loss, if revealed to the airline/client - without whom, G&G's collapse is assured - requires that somebody locate both Kamins and the money ASAP.  With his background as a former cop and his experience as a financial crimes investigator, Molloy seems the best candidate for the job of turning up both attorney and cash.  Below the surface (and not that deeply either) Molloy presents a better candidate - he's the firm's least productive attorney: a recovering alcoholic (he did better when he drank); failed father and husband, disgraced ex-cop (Molloy testified against a veteran detective to save his own skin, then poisoned both sides against him when his testimony bungled the prosecution.) and all about middle-aged wreck.  In other words, he's the best guy to have around to explain why neither money nor Kamins were ever found.  <br />This was a great Turow book - better than \\"Burden of Proof\\" though still not as coherent as \\"Presumed Innocent\\".  Though its title uses a familiar legal phrase, \\"Pleading\\" is less about the law or litigation than about people who happen to be lawyers.  As in those other books, Turow is a master of constructing characters who are both very real and have a very convincing capacity to analyze each other.  As in the other books, the accent is on the failings of the characters.  An intricate plot relies on our own weaknesses: the mystery seems to get bigger and more complicated, though the climax shows that the reverse is true - the mystery gets more simple, and we learn that the various clues point to smaller conspiracies separate from each other.  Where the plot bogs down is handling its cast of legal rogues - especially the head lawyers of G&G who occupy different areas of the spectra of respectability, morality and greed.  (Turow introduces them as a group, though never makes the transition to treating them as real individuals until Molloy finds he must play them each against each other)  There's a beautiful and brilliant attorney named \\"Brushy\\" who - though no stranger to Molloy - suddenly surprises him by revealing her infatuation for him.  Molloy must also deal with Detective Gino Dimonte, a financial crimes investigator whose career Molloy ruined years earlier - nicknamed \\"Pigeyes\\", Dimonte was the detective whom Molloy testified against.  Then there's Molloy himself.  Though the story's narrator, Molloy springs the biggest surprise on us.  We're supposed to think that he'll rise above it all despite his weaknesses (which are profound).  Instead, and without giving up too much, he rises above it all because of them.  The details of the embezzlement that kicks off the story are pretty complicated (if you read \\"Burden\\", think of the wheat futures deal), but that won't keep you from getting into the story or the characters.	2002-08-18

The story here has a group of vacationers sailing the Bermuda triangle and encountering many of the phenomenon that comprised that area's lore (time warps, lost ships and people, UFOs and a weird cloud of...something that seems nonexistant even as it seems to get grit on everything.  Many of the characters already know a thing or two about the Bermuda Triangle and its legends, which robs the story of much surprise, although you spend much of the book wondering which way the story will go.  The final ending is a bit off-putting, but it was fun while it lasted, and \\"Sargasso\\" is actually a great beach book.	2002-08-12
US	49374774	R2YICKSU2KCFLF	0380763710	88504435	Sidewinder	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Not a very lethal plot	Iranian forces - using armed speedboats called \\"Boghammers\\" and their Shah-era American jets - make life miserable for Persian Gulf shipping.  To counter the threat, a British diplomat comes up with a plausibly deniable plan teaming British pilots in old but still formidable Hawker Hunters and F-14's from a nearby USN carrier.<br />With all of the elaborate plots of Dale Brown and similar books, \\"Sidwinder\\" seems pretty thin - uppity Iranians, an Iranian fighter ace who seems to flip between being a world-class jerk and simple psychosis, stiff British types, and anonymously stalwart Americans.  The book keeps the yankee ace and his Persian rival at a distance, not even trying to bring them together sooner without it becoming the battle royale.  To fill the time, we have the hero undergo the normal trials of being a carrier-fighter driver, though with less of the depth than you'll find in most other books.  Just about everything in this book seems like it was borrowed from other books, or at least generic.  Even the name \\"Sidewinder\\" - one of the world's most widely used counter-air missiles - doesn't have anything much to do with the plot.  (\\"Dueling Tomcats\\" - a reference to the airplane flown by both sides, would have been a better title, but would also have required a better book to stamp it on.)  Even the F-14 which is at the heart of the story seems even more underwritten than the jets in most other books.  Technothriller writers are routinely praised for prose that makes the reader feels as if he's actually riding one of the jets, though few actually earn that praise, and nothing here breaks that depressing pattern.  Nothing here reminds of how big, powerful or complicated the big plane is.  Both the Iranian F-14 and the Navy Tomcat seem to be in the same condition, even though a US embargo of spare parts had nearly resulted in grounding of all US built jets by the mid 1980's.  You'd think that the Iranian plane would have its share of problems.  The author could have written a book simply about the Iranian pilot's trvails in the Gulf War without indulging in grandiose air war stories (which readers could have satisfed themselves for simply by buying \\"Falcon 3.0\\" which came out at the same time.  There's simply not enough detail to satisfy fans of Tom Clancy (or even Patrick Robinson).  The Iranian ace is so over-the-top, you almost think this book a parody, but there's not much to him - besides the fact that he's a monster jerk - to make him funny (and a gratuitous rape, though thankfully underwritten, just to remind you that this isn't fun).  Instead, read any of the Grafton books, or pick up a copy of \\"Punk's War\\" by Ward Carroll.	2002-08-07
US	49374774	R2LKDP0V0QD823	0553257803	864567832	Red Banner Mutiny	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Not very revolutionary	During a cold epoch of the cold war, the political officer of a Soviet destroyer (a Krivak, for those who need to know) leads a band of mutineers to seize the ship and sail across the Baltic for freedom.  This fictionalized account of the story (credited for inspiring Clancy to write \\"Red Oktober\\") reads like a cross between a lame technothriller and the sort of 1980's anti-Soviet polemic.  The mutiny was ultimately unsuccessful - a loyal crew member escaped and managed to get the authorities enough of a warning to cut the ship off before it could reach Sweden.  The \\"heroic\\" would-be defector is tried and executed, and upright Americans who learn of the virtually suppressed account can only shake their heads at another example of the madness of those trapped in the Soviet state.<br />I had two problems with this story - first is the same problem I have with any story \\"inspired by actual events\\".  If there's any factual support for the account, why publish it as fiction at all?  Also, where does the \\"actual\\" end and the \\"inspired\\" begin?  Lastly, though based on a true story, the details seem so vague that it could have been entirely fictitous.<br />The book's other big problem is that the shallow story is just a platform for another Reagan-era anti-Soviet screed, one in which an ethically pure America is juxtaposed against a Soviet Union composed of corrupt or inept ideologues.  The prosecutor who condemns Valery Sablin, the ringleader of the mutiny, is nearly unhinged by his target.  Various loyal Soviet crewmen (aside from the engineer who saves the day for the Reds) are either dishonest or simply lazy.  (No mention is made of American mutineers like Ronald Pelton or the Walker family, who sold out their country for a whole lot less than these guys did).  Sablin and his conspirators are correspondingly heroic, even as the book unintentionally raises serious questions about their plan.  Though making a break for freedom, Sablin seems not to have considered even defecting until his ballerina lover had already done the same, and the story never shows him suffering for his freedom.  Even the idea of defecting with a Soviet ship seems more foolhardy than brave.  (When Alex Zhuyev flew his MiG-29 to the west in 1989, even he knew that there were easier ways to get out of the Soviet Union; the idea that the Soviet Union is surrounded on all sides by a frontier as impassible as the Berlin Wall is a myth, and an intelligent man like Sablin would have been expected to know better).  All in all, if you're looking for a story as full of detail and suspense as \\"Hunt For Red Oktober\\", then you're best advised to pick up a copy of \\"Hunt For Red Oktober\\".	2002-07-12
US	49374774	R3MKD691EJEESL	0684824035	250686735	Radio Priest: Charles Coughlin, The Father of Hate Radio	Books	4	21	26	N	N	Flawed, but still excellent biography	\\"Radio Priest\\" is meant to remind people the author fears have both forgotten Father Charles Coughlin and may be unwisely underestimating those eager to apply his brand of media manipulation in the age of the internet.  From the depths of the depression until shortly after America's entry into WWII, Coughlin, a Detroit Priest had become a political force of nature.  Using his radio show and \\"Social Justice\\" his newspaper, he spread his message across the nation - a message that grew progressively overt in anti-Semitism and Facist advocacy. With the severity of the depression destroying lives across the world, the time was ripe for many to question democracy - as they had across the world, the popularity of socialism and fascism flourished across America.  Though many figures grew out of the clash of these movements, Coughlin stood out - mostly because his position as a priest but mostly because of the eloquence with which he gave his fans the message they wanted to hear.  He even possessed his own trademark accent, with its distinctive rolling rrr's.  Coughlin attacked banking interests and polticians - codewords for the jews and those they were thought to have bought.  Confronted with growing reports of Germany's anti-Semitic repression, he claimed sympathy for the jews, but attributed Germany's conduct to a natural response to Jewish Bolshevism.  Ostensibly adhering to a religion which had suffered religious intolerance, Coughlin adopted the same penchant for mass hysteria as those who had victimized other Catholics.  <br />Though war with fascism forced him into a sort of hiatus, Coughlin's decline had actually begun with the 1936 Presidential Elections.  Unsatisfied with GOP front-runner Alf Landon, and seized by an outright hatred for FDR, Coughlin campaigned fiercely for the Social Justice candidate, William Lemke.  Those left unfulfilled by FDR and unimpressed with Landon, flocked to Coughlin and his allies.  Among them, Francis Townsend seemed more dignified, GLK Smith had more energy and Huey Long had more savvy, but Coughlin possessed something of the qualities of all three.  Though Coughlin had the power, he displayed little interest in using it for even his idea of a greater good, and the social justice ticket ballot was dwarfed even by Landon's showing.  By then, Long was dead by an assassin's bullet, and his political machine in Louisiana collapsed under the weight of its own corruption.  Emboldened by his landslide, FDR embarked on a strategy to fast-track the New Deal with legislation designed to end run a hostile supreme court and thinly veiled threats to pack the high court if the first idea didn't work out.  Coughlin, on the other hand, now embittered with politics, lost much of his dignified veneer.  Both in his own tone and those of his followers, Coughlin became more closely identified with all that was bigoted in domestic fascism.  By 1940, Coughlin had been sufficiently cut down to manageable size for his own church's hierarchy, and the Bishops silenced him.  The threat of prosecution for sedition further kept him in line.<br />Doanld Warren argues persuasively that Coughlin's defeats - both in 1936 and when war broke out against those he had championed - were far from certain.  Coughlin and others had long fed anti-Semitic hysteria in their warnings against the war.  When the severity of the war was realized, hysteria against the Jews could have exploded in Coughlin's favor.  Warren even cites outbreaks of anti-Jewish violence in American cities.  Further, despite the consent decree that immunized Coughlin in return for his silence, the radio priest remained active in using the mail system to search for a new generation of adherents among wartime servicemen.  Warren highlights the depths of anti-Semitism in wartime America, but doesn't do the same for the horrific conditions of the depression - conditions that made us ripe for Coughlin and his followers.  Also, he loses his focus after 1936, when Coughlin and company become more outright in their bigotry.  Lastly, Warren frequently telegraphs his own sentiments against more modern day Coughlins like Pat Robertson and the Moral Majority.  Whether today's right wing approximates that of 1936 America is a worthy subject, but one that Warren's asides seem to cursorily accept as true - an indisputable yardstick of conservative religious bigotry.  Worse, it telegraphs the author's intention to write for a narrow readership - something Coughlin was doubtless famous for, though admittedly on a higher scale.  These faults wouldn't matter if \\"Radio Priest\\" wasn't already a compelling book.  Luckily, the book is not only compelling, but substantive enough to rise above what's wrong with it as well.	2002-06-26

The catacombs of the title is the home of an ancient race of advanced beings evolved from lions.  Once the masters of Earth, the \\"Zan\\" were driven into suspended animation by some unknown calamity.  Now their resting place inside the hollow of a mountain in a contemporary African republic has been located, along with a number of fiery diamonds on which the Zan printed the secrets of their civilization.  The once heroic revolutionary who now rules the African republic offers the stones to the first super-power willing to trade nuclear weapons for them.  (The Zan, we learn, developed a shield to protect Earth from a meteor barrage, though the superpowers believe the shield would work as well against incoming ICBM's)  The Americans and the Soviets, too eager to bargain, dispatch their own agents to the distant catacombs where the archeological team assigned slowly realizes that the catacombs aren't quite dormant.<br />This was a promising idea for a story - parts technothriller, paranormal thriller and Indiana Jones, but it never quite works.  The biggest problem is that it takes most of the book for the purported heroes to reach the catacombs - with the book being less about the mysterious catacombs than the travails of land-travel in Africa (imagine watching an episode of the X-Files in which Mulder and Scully spend most of the episode trying to get a rental car).  Then there are the characters - I'm not trying to be literary here, but you don't need to be into Henry James to appreciate good character, like \\"Raiders\\" without Indiana Jones, or a generic James Bond.  There are several characters who seem like they're supposed to be the heroes - a diplomat, the archeologist, an agent - but never get to the forefront or anywhere near it (of course, it doesn't help that there's no story for them to get to).  The African dictator is also an interesting figure -a distinguished and respected revolutionary slowly verging into militancy and autocracy (imagine Nelson Mandela slowly morphing into Robert Mugabe).  Though he's willing to trade the stones with anybody for nukes, we know he's got one target on his mind - South Africa.  The story never makes clear how willing he is to unleash nukes or simply hold them over Preatoria.  Of course the biggest hole in the Catacombs are the Catacombs themselves.  The author describes them and their inhabitants only briefly, and hints at how advanced the Zan were (a mysterious force preserves everything within - not even milk goes bad) but then seems to ignore them completely.  We get barely a glimmer of what the archeologists must have learnt by the time the book starts.  What a botch.	2002-06-12

In \\"Different\\", Mitchel Gant has retired from both USAF and the CIA.  For those unfamiliar with the character, Gant was a former fighter jock who was emotionally and physically scarred due to his experiences in Vietnam; after the war, the CIA plucks him from obscurity and teaches him to fly again.  Never getting past his war demons, Gant becomes a master, flying America's collection of \\"appropriated\\" Russian fighters.  When the Soviets develop a fighter plane superior to anything in the west, Gant is sent into the USSR to steal it (the action spread into two novels - \\"Firefox\\" and \\"Firefox Down\\").  Gant reappears in the epic \\"Winterhawk\\" on a mission that has nothing to do with the Firefox, but involves a personal conflict born in \\"Firefox Down\\".  By the time the events in \\"Different\\" occur, Gant has already survived \\"Desert Storm\\" (he flew stealth fighters) and has been both married and divorced and now spends his time investigating aircraft accidents.  Gant's former father in law, CEO of a company that builds jet liners, is in trouble when his airplanes - Vance 494s mysteriously fall out of the sky, and he reluctantly turns to Gant for help.  Meanwhile, David Winterbourne, the corrupt head of a vast corporate empire faces some problems of his own stemming from cost overruns on a mammoth jet liner that nobody wants to buy.  Meanwhile, Marion Pyott, a young and strong willed MP, looks into mysterious delays in an urban renewal program undertaken by Winterbourne Holdings.  Though the action involves separate threads, we soon learn how they are linked - with the delays in Pyott's program resulting from diversion of funds to shore up Winterborne's bloated jet liner, while the 494's problems were actually caused by sabotage meant to eliminate competition in orders for the Winterbourne plane.  <br />Though it covers a big subject (actually several) \\"Different\\" is a surprisingly short book.  And while it heralds the return of Mitch Gant, the story does less with him than it does with Marion Pyott.  (Gant gets most of the action, but author Craig Thomas, whose books are famous for their character development, devotes more time to the headstrong Pyott).  Thomas tosses in charcters familiar to his avid readers - like Ken Aubrey - but they seem more like cameos that don't hint at the extraordinary development they've had.  Because the story is so short, Thomas doesn't spend enough time curing our suspension of belief : he frequently tosses in almost unbelievable plot twists, but cures that with plots that make it clear that nobody is getting off easy.  In \\"Different\\", the \\"howlers\\" include Gant's being able to locate the mysterious sabouteur using a photograph that may have been taken anywhere on Earth; Winterbourne saboutages the 494 as a competitor even though the story makes it clear that the two planes are completely different - like a minvan builder saboutaging Ferraris (Boeing and Airbus are nowhere to be found, but you'd think the market for aircraft is larger, yet only Vance's jets fall out of the sky).  Still, for those waiting for Gant since \\"Winterhawk\\", \\"Different\\" is fun with Thomas's breathless prose and a conspiracy as deep as anything Soviet.  The flying scenes won't exactly rival Firefox, but, for a non-pilot, Thomas is more evocative about flight than most former fighter drivers.  When Gant first takes to the air in the Vance airliner, the slow transition to flight makes you feel more airborne than flight scenes in other books - even though you know you're only flying an airliner, that there won't be any dogfights and that the cold war is over.	2002-06-02

Even if you plunge into the series in the middle (which is how I discovered) and haven't a clue as to what's going on, who's who (and why?), you'll still find a mammoth epic you can't put down.<br />Luther Arkwright is essentially a super-being, bred to psionic perfection in an alternative universe, or a parallel.  We soon learn that existence is filled with so-called parallels (a misnomer since parallel lines maintain the same direction while the alternative universes here maintain some interesting differences; the fun is trying to identify how any of the parallels resembles our own earth, only to have Talbot yank the carpet from under our feet and show us the distinctions).  Two of the parallels take the focus of the story - 00, being the home of a technologically and psionically advanced civilization which tries to maintain order throughout the parallels, and 072, a parallel in which the major imperial powers of Europe remain in power through the 20th century.  Using an almost sentient computer called Wotan, 00 learns of another force that shares their power to cross the multiversal divides, but does not share their benign aims.  Called disruptors, the enemy searches for an ancient weapon, one that will destroy all of existence.  Only Luther, whose powers and origins remain a mystery to everybody, can stop the destruction.  On 072, where England remains under the rule of the fascist and theocratic puritan dictatorship led by a descendent of Oliver Cromwell, Luther meets his greatest challenge.  Cromwell, we soon learn, is the disruptor agent for that parallel; Luther must maneauver to secure victory for the anti-puritan royalists without giving too much power to the royal's imperialist backers.  The challenge manifests itself when Luther discovers both the limits of his powers and the signs that others like him inhabit the parallel.<br />The dense plot guarantees that you'll be re-reading AoLA repeatedly, that you'll be piecing it together, and that you'll soon find its BW artwork superior to the color of the sequel.	2002-05-26
US	49374774	RGGI6CW4RNL88	0553563718	154281972	Genocide (Aliens)	Books	2	3	4	N	N	The newest mediocre Aliens story	There isnt that much wrong with Aliens Genocide that isnt wrong with the course of the whole Aliens franchise, but this book seems somewhat emblematic with how tired the subject has become.  Based upon the Darkhorse Graphic series of the same name, Genocide occurs about a generation after the Female War.  (For those whose knowledge of Aliens ends with the first two flicks, an update: prior to Alien3 Darkhorse printed Aliens mini-series, the early ones dwelling on the main characters who survived the 2nd movie; Genocide was the first comic to jettison the original characters of Aliens.  The first series had Aliens finally reaching Earth due to corporate greed, governmental collusion and  new for the franchise  a religious cult.  Ripley, who sat out the first two series, returned for Female War in which she tracks down the Aliens queen mother and, bringing her to Earth, dispatches her with nukes.  As we all know, if there' one way to be sure of anything, it involves nukes.  Darkhorse began novelizing the graphic novels after Alien3 was released, and had to rework the stories to account for characters we now know did not survive Aliens.)  <br />With the queen mother dispatched, Earths infestation problem becomes manageable.  Grant, a corrupt businessman modeled on Gordon Gecko and Donald Trump, owns a pharmaceutical company that manufactures drugs based on chemicals secreted by the alien queen.  When those using the drugs demonstrate an unexpected side effect  turning them into mindless killing machines  the military suddenly renews its interest.  You guessed it.  Since the mysterious royal jelly can only be obtained on a planet crawling with ferocious alien bugs, its time for greed and arrogance to override good sense and the impulse for self preservation - all other considerations secondary.  For reasons never made convincingly clear, Grant decides to accompany the intrepid voyagers to theAliens planet.  (Simply because economic ruin hangs over his head, were supposed to think hell easily face the possibility of hosting a chestburster?  I dont think so.)  The humans have technology on their side, but the aliens offer a new wrinkle  the death of the Queen Mother has fragmented the aliens crude society, causing the hives to war against another, but not so much that they wont tear apart anybody else they see.  Worse, a saboteur has snuck aboard the expedition, threatening to end the missionand Grants life.  That said, Genocide punks out.  Grant becomes the hero after an unconvincing change of heart.  The saboteur is no surprise when revealed (the story telegraphs so much suspicion on one character, its no great surprise when he turns out to be innocent.), and the moral of the story could only be appreciated by people willing to aknowledge being as amoral as the main characters of this story start out as.  Where this story shows how tired the whole Alien saga has become is by not doing much scary with them  they fight in the open, and mankind has already learned how to control them if sometimes sloppily (now theyre no scarier than nuclear power).  For a better story, get the Darkhorse graphic novel Alien: Hives or Sacrifices  which are more compact stories run on tighter characters.	2002-05-23
US	49374774	R1RR0U2BMT7BI1	042510107X	34724671	Red Storm Rising	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Epic tome on WWIII	\\"Red Storm Rising\\" was already hailed a blockbuster when it was released, but time hasn't dulled its edge.  When a sudden petro crisis threatens to grind the Soviet industrial base to a halt (in a grim foreshadowing of the post cold-war era, Azeri separatists sabotage a major petroleum refinery in Siberia; damage from the resulting inferno is exacerbated by a combination of shoddy Soviet safety practices and corrupt cronyism)  the Kremlin's leadership and military reaches for the only reasonable response.  Believing the west will surely exploit the Soviets' crippled state should the situation become known (the Soviets reveal the loss, but play it down), the Russian leadership mobilizes for war.  Their plan: a brilliant pre-emptive strike, one designed to anticipate an imminent assault from the west, and head it off.  With Russian armor stabbing into Central Europe, a Soviet amphibious assault force on Iceland and Soviet subs prowling in packs in the North Atlantic, the west is besieged.  The plot of \\"Red Storm\\" follows individuals on both sides in Iceland, under the Atlantic and in central Europe as the war grinds on.  <br />Though written years ago, nobody has yet matched this book's epic scope.  For a book this big and far reaching, it's obviously impossible for Clancy to provide substantive characters for every epic scene.  Unfortunately, this results in many scenes in which the only real character is a ship or a plane.  Though few of the characters will leap out at you, and some of the dialog may be laughable now (when asked by his Russian prisoners the reason they are being executed, the heroic American officer responds \\"for Afghanistan\\".) you'll remember more of what works and remains fresh than what doesn't.  As for the techno, few writers were as willing as Clancy to tangle with such spanking new hardware as the MiG-29 and the \\"Stealth\\" fighter.  (Clancy's stealth fighter was only a conceptual model of what the plane turned out to be, largely inspired by a Testor's model kit based on educated guesses; although the real thing turned out to quite distinct from the concept model, Clancy designs his fighter underlining and revealing so much of the science of stealth and electronic warfare that its substance isn't measurably diminished by the real thing.)  What really raises \\"Red\\" over most other books is the shear exhaustion suffered by the main characters.  This is hardly the heroic wish-fulfillment that critics assume it to be.	2002-05-22

I just got to the point where I was beginning to understand the first one! Graphic author Bryan Talbot has given us another cross-universe tale involving everybody's favorite psionic-messiah. Though conspicuously inferior (even though it's in color) to the original series  a circa late 80s black and white science-fictational story in nine parts, it's still a massive romp. <BR>IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF LUTHER ARKWRIGHT: The continuum in which Arkwright lives encompasses a reality composed of multiple universes called paras  each one being its own reality both divergent and convergent with others.  While the inhabitants of most of these universes are oblivious to the existence of the others, the advanced (and highly secularized society) of Para 00.00 has not only learned how to cross the multi-versal divide, but has taken it upon itself to police the continuum.  Using high-technology and psionics, they saved the continuum in the first series from a doomsday weapon fielded by a mysterious army called disruptors.  Luther Arkwright is 00.00s greatest weapon against multi-versal disruption, but even he is an alien to 00.00.  Arkwright instead is the product of eons of genetic engineering meant to create a human with unmatched psy-powers, capable of crossing the barriers between parallel universes. As in the original AoLA, \\"Heart\\" involves some terrifying threat to the existence of the entire continuum, but focuses much of the action on a parallel in which the imperialistic powers of pre-WWI Europe were never wiped out. (In AoLA, the crown heads of Europe conspire to overthrow the fascist British regime descended from the 17th century theocratic protectorate of Oliver Cromwells Puritans and install a puppet king in his place; with Cromwells help, the weak Prince Charles is killed and his sister, the strong-willed Anne succeeds to the throne on Cromwells ouster.  When the rest of Europes royalty is accidentally killed in the climactic battle of AoLA, leaving Anne the sole surviving ruler, her kingdom is poised to become the greatest on Earth.)  Got that?  <BR>A complex plot linked Luthers origins with the fate of the universe and that of the inhabitants of that specific para.  Even when its plot wasn't clear AoLA excelled in its narrative, a peerless blend of graphic art and judicious use of prose and dialog in place of traditional comic technique of using thought-baloons. To sweeten things for people who insisted on having everything explained to them, Talbot crafted a wonderfully nuanced alternative earth, inspired by Europe in both its early fascist and terminal imperialist phases (AoLA appeared in the late 1980's when the cold war looked ready to take a dramatic turn). <BR>\\"Heart \\" takes place nearly 20 years later and Britannia truly rules.  While Princess Victoria, the tempestuous daughter of Anne and Luther, struggles under endless migraines, the empire faces threats from without and within.  Anne's closest advisers are actually a cell of hardcore neo-Puritans, with a plan to reclaim power; while in Rome, a dying pope dispatches an assassin with orders to ensure that Anne \\"render her empire to the Church\\". Unknown to them all, a horrific psionic force is building strength across the many universes, primed to explode in days, already leaving hints of itself everywhere. Luther, who disappeared shortly after Anne's ascension, a feared victim of underground puritans, is of no help. Only Victoria, who may have inherited Luther's psi-capabilities, has a realization of something horrible and imminent. In frequent black-outs, she dreams of her twin brother Henry, murdered by puritan terrorists. <BR>\\"Heart\\" is superb, but still less than AoLA. The colors are splashy, but lack the intricate detail that drove AoLA 's plot robs the sequel of its narrative force. Also missing...is Luther himself for large spans of the story - leaving poorVicky to shoulder the burdens of heroism, which also deprives the story of as centralized character as Luther. When Luther does show up, he's more aloof than ever, unfortunately. Also missing is a good villain - the neo-puritans of this book are just a bunch of deluded fascists, possessing not a shred of the self-awareness of Cromwell in the first book. Their leader, Kray is too cartoonish (metaphorically and literally  we first meet him as he  poses for a portrait that looks more real than he does).  Vain and hinting of racial tendencies that underlined Anglo-identity theory, he's a corseted, spectacled loser with shoulder pads and a bad haircut to go with his big dreams; only Queen Anne's growing dementia allows these guys to get as far as they do. Nothing underlines the futility of the puritans' cause as much as their slogan - \\"The Future Belongs to Us\\" (I wonder how long it took to dream that up). The joke of course is that there may not be a future to steal. The horrific force itself, when revealed, is essentially a blob, a force of nature without the character of those who invented the fire frost weapon of the first series. The real menace of the original story was Luther and his untapped abilities, but that's sidelined in the sequel. Even Rosa Wylde, Luthers love of  the first series is grayed here.  With her hair in beads, Rosa looks a shadow of her former self. The end is much too pat and unsatisfying, revealing the disparity between two Arkwright epics. Still, it's an Arkwright story, one that you can get into if you've never read the first, and one that perhaps should be read first.	2002-05-21
US	49374774	R39MPR25RR5ZFJ	0345370066	966099780	Spy Line	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Great entry in the series...if you want a series....	Its just another day in the espionage war in a divided Europe.  The wall hasnt come down, and its an unending game of Spy v. Spy on both sides.  At the outset of Spyline British agent Bernard Samson is in hiding in a dingy section of the divided and espionage-ridden city of Berlin.  Why hes in exile isnt exactly clear to him, even as he does have some friends, or at least some human resources on which he can rely.  He feels it may have something to do with his wife, Fiona, who disappeared after going over to the Russians.  Allowed to return home to his new wife, Gloria, Samson thinks his problems are behind him.  Instead, he soon realizes that something is brewing, something that will send him back across the wall, to tangle with a psychotic American who kills for any side that will hire him, and to finally confront his wife.<br />Its clear that Spy Line is an entry in a larger series, one that began with Spy Hook (which it immediately followed) and culminated in Spy Sinker  the complex relationships and their continuity are obviously much larger than any single book.  (The Spy books themselves are also part of a much larger continuity  one including the trilogies of Game-Set-Match, as well as Charity, Hope and Faith, as well as the WWII epic Winter).  Line is also dwarfed by its shortness (for the quality of its writing, its not a long read; also the plot covers a brief span of time) and by the loose ends it creates (Fionas sister insists on accompanying Bernard into The East  with disastrous results; and how will Bernard explain everything to Gloria?) without resolving them.  Deighton is less concerned with resolving problems than in artfully describing the pain they cause.  Unfortunately, that makes the book seem painfully unstructured  like an episode of a TV show.  Line like most of Deightons books, is worth reading for the quality of prose alone.  However, the plot details  which take Bernard from Berlin to London, and to Vienna, meeting stamp collectors, historians, ex-spies and freelance murderers  seems above the book, implying that youll have to read all the Samson books.  Its almost like a prison sentence, and clearly one that has taken its toll on poor Samson.  In short  a good book, but only great book if youre willing to read a dozen more.	2002-05-20
US	49374774	RR4YNPHFS11D2	1560543442	16868636	Bomber: Events Relating to the Last Flight of an R.A.F. over Germany on the Night of June 31, 1943	Books	4	4	4	N	N	War in the skies, on land, at sea, and all points in between	Though the title implies that this is the story of a single bomber, \\"Bomber\\" goes farther - much farther, only starting with the crew of the heavy bomber \\"Joe for King\\". Deighton then covers other aircrews and their families and superiors before cutting across the channel to the enemy - night-fighter pilots, their controllers in German air defense, various suspicious characters from across the spectrum of Germany's military - from \\"respectable\\" Luftwaffe and Wehrmacht personnel to shadowy types from the \\"Abwehr\\" and the SS. We also meet the civilian residents of Altgarten, a Ruhr-area town nobody would think of bombing, but which manages to get plastered all the same. It's mid-summer 1943, when \\"Joe for King\\" is sent into the Ruhr as part of a massive night-time raid against the industrial centers of Krefeld. Lacking night-vision goggles, RAF pilots of 1943 drop their bombs on targets marked by flares left by directing aircraft - in this case, specially equipped Mosquitoe night-fighters. When the marker plane for the Krefeld raid is shot down prematurely, its flares are released over Altgarten. This error is compounded by inherent flaws in RAF tactics (like targeting bombs in the center of cities, where bombs are more likely to hit civilian homes than factories and military installations), and the town becomes the unintended target for the massive strike. \\"Bomber\\" is to RAF's wartime bomber command what \\"Traffic\\" is to the DEA - a story of massive scale borne by wide cast if characters that never stops growing. Deighton plays no favorites, certainly not with nationality.  The Germans are on the receiving end of the bombs here, but there are plenty of overt references to the Nazis' crimes. On the British side, we see officers acting less like gentlemen than soldiers. Political correctness is the rule (this is the country that gave us \\"1984\\"; \\"Joe for King\\"'s commander is suspected of incipient Bolshevism - it's very name hints at Stalin). Those who won't fall in line risk being labeled as LMF - Lacking Moral Fiber - officially branded as cowards. Though books with such a command of detail tend towards charitability (if not nostalgically) to those they depict, Deighton is uniformly negative on the subject, a tone reinforced by his many subplots. Lambert, \\"Joe for King's\\" rebel pilot, plays the best cricket in Bomber Command - leading his odious superior to compel his participation in an upcoming tournament on pain of getting LMF'd. (Worse - the commander pressures Mrs. Lambert after her husband has departed for the big raid). Previous owners of the land that became the RAF base at Warley Fen, a once verdant field, now stare at the airfield, mourning for what they know they will never have again. In Germany, ADF is managed by August Bach, an aged warrior preparing to marry his young son's nanny, not knowing how her youthful looks have made her the target of vicious rumors through Altgarten. The pilots of a night-fighter squadron (nichtjagdeschwader), preparing for a feared RAF attack on the Ruhr, are thrown into turmoil when Abwehr and Gestapo appear in search of a stolen classifed memo. The memo, it turns out, details hypothermia experiments on concentration camp prisoners (this may be same memo mentioned early in Robert Harriss' superb \\"Fatherland\\"). The corrupt assistant to Altgarten's Burgomeister arranges for the downgrading of the town's remaining Jews (from 1/3rd to 2/3rd \\"Jewishness\\" - though these jews are even more likely to face deportation and certain death, they will have greater freedom to marry other jews). Altgarten itself is flooded with profiteers funneling goods looted from conquered parts of Russia and the Netherlands. Deighton hints at the underlying corruption of humanity actually tamed by war - it seems that war is the only thing keeping the world safe because it occupies all the amoral types who have to fight it. The only morally just adults are the TENO - the civil safety personnel who dig people out of bombed buildings. Because they are stationed in Altgarten, they get the biggest break: when the raid comes, they have the shortest commute. With so much going on, you just know you're bound to miss something. This is the sort of book that speed-readers hate. You'll probably lose count of all the characters that Deighton throws at you, though this doesn't hurt the plot as much as make the book one you'll want to re-read. Be warned - once you pick up bomber, you'll probably be spoiled for any other novel on the war in the skies over Europe.ombed buildings.

For one thing, it's about the November Aces, a multi-national team of fighter pilots zipping around in the Tornado jet fighter.  Most of November's Tornadoes are GR3, the lumbering ground attack version, but some are the sexier ADV version (or \\"variant\\").  Though meant to keep the peace in Europe, the November pilots - who know that they're the best of the best - can only watch helplessly from their multi-million dollar planes as civilians are ground up in Yugoslavia.  Two of their pilots decide to do something about it.  Meanwhile (and there are a lot of those in this book), the MacAllister of the title has been lying low in Bosnia targeting snipers when she's spotted and recognized by Russian peacekeepers.  Meanwhile, a Russian general in Moscow puts the pieces together and becomes obsessed with the lone MacAllister - insuring that Russian warplanes will be around to meet the rogue Tornado jet.  Meanwhile, November's beleagured commander faces pressure from his pilots and his own bureaucratic commanders.  Before long, it's clear that this isn't so much a novel - with a beginning, middle and end - as it is a printed episode of a series dealing with November flight.  There's no character development, and the author doesn't spend much time fleshing out the complexities of flight or the dazzling technologies involved.  I can't belive somebody thought this was the best aviation book they've seen - I've read other books that didn't knock me off my feet but were still more fun than this.	2002-05-15

(the real Pan Am had just gone under when this book appeared, and hardcore aviation enthusiasts were finding it hard to let go).  The new Pan Am has a novel idea - fewer passengers per flight, leaving more room for lounges.  Unfortunately, the idea is a dangerous one (more on that), and somebody has now set their sights on grounding PA for good.  A series of elaborate accidents - so effective that heroic and quick-thinking piloting just barely save the day - plague PA planes in the air.  On the ground, the mysterious conspiracy works to undercut PA's financing, requiring equally heroic and quick-thinking accounting methods.  Will PA survive?<br />Will anybody care?  \\"Phoenix Rising\\" is the typical example of a book that tries to come off as gripping and edge of your seat even as its prose and marketing are aimed comfortably within a well-established market (the market for readers who cares about an airline being named Pan Am; readers who know that there is a \\"big three\\" of US airlines; readers who care about the inner workings of aircraft financing).  The premise itself has a big hole in it - why would somebody care enough about Pan Am to ground it?  The heroine's explanation is utterly illogical: because it would prove you could fly planes with fewer passengers and with greater amenities and still turn a profit.  Forgetting that that's pure wish fulfillment, were it true, the other airlines could just copy Pan Am's idea and profit just as easily as Pan Am.  (Because the other airlines' position couldn't be as precarious as Pan Am's, they'd be even better positioned to profit from the idea than Pan Am, so the idea is simply illogical).  The mysterious conspirators could also simply buy Pan Am outright.  What really kills the book is...who cares?  This isn't a book about a horrible air crash (\\"Final Approach\\") or some doomsday weapon (\\"Medusa's Child\\").  This is a book about airplanes flying with sleeper seats and treadmills - hardly earthshaking, and not worth anybody's time.	2002-05-13

They gather together and restore and rearm a squadron of WWII fighter planes - legendary Messerschmit Bf-109f's - and wreak havoc across that part of the US.  Meanwhile, an aging USAAF vet, who was captured and nearly killed by the German aces on the last day of WWII, spends his time nearby flying a restored Mustang.  The Germans nurse a grudge against him, though it's merely symbolic - he's the last Yank they saw before the end of the war, and he's hardly risen to the sort of prominence that would make him an inviting target.  Nevertheless, they tear off into their targets with the idea of saving some of their fire for him.  When word of the resurrected Luftwaffe gets around (how could it not?), the yankee flier gathers a group of vets himself - more Mustangs and a solitary Spitfire, and it seems that the last air battle of WWII is about to be refought.<br />\\"Eagles\\" was an innocuous enough book - the violence is mostly on the level of the A-Team.  I guess we're supposed to like these guys enough to be fascinated about them.  The real problem for me was the lack of a central character - the author tosses in another, an investigator who tracks down the grayed eagles and tries to persuade them to end their flights, before being forced to join them.  The flying scenes suffered because there's no single POV, but that's not unusual for technothrillers and similar books.  But the book also wastes an opportunity to get into the \\"warbird\\" subculture, in which old combat aircraft and their stories are restored and preserved.  Instead, once each side gathers their troops together, they begin to think as if they were back in WWII.  Last of all, the book has a lught touch, which is fine, but it turns violent and sad by the end.  Still, \\"Eagles\\" was a worthy read, if not a memorable one.	2002-05-10

Commandeering the sub, a band of skilled mercenaries tie up the crew and sail the sub out into the Atlantic.  The sub, an SSBN, carries nuclear ballistic missiles - enough of them to start and finish WW-III through WW-IX.  Thus begins the \\"The Triton Ultimatum\\".  The aims of the hijackers aren't known, but they are experts at running a nuclear sub, and they clearly have plans for the ship's missiles.  With an odd hint of \\"The Hunt for Red Oktober\\" (which came out 6 years after this book) we learn that the hijackers are not only brilliant, but have their own grudges against the world.  Meanwhile, the US tries to hunt the sub down, even as some of their own leaders ponder how to turn WWIII to America's advantage.  \\"Triton\\" is smart, not in its mastery of military details, but with its undercurrent of dark humor.  The author never tries to overplay the atmosphere of imminent doom, and frequently adds a sort of surreal touch.  (one example has the President trying to debrief the L&C's Captain over a lavish breakfast in the oval office; the poor captain, after floating for days in the Atlantic, can barely hold a butterknife).  This is probably the most fun you'll have reading a technothriller.  Not quite up to \\"Red Oktober\\" or \\"To Kill the Potemkin\\", it's a reader nonetheless.	2002-05-10

It has no speeds, no fender.  The boy is hoping to find his father in Rutterberg and give him an important package.  He is all alone.  <br />\\"I am the Cheese\\" is a deceptively simple book.  Though it's short and has simple and easy prose, you quickly get the idea that something else is going on, or that something horrible has happened.  You soon wonder what that horrible thing was, but even that question takes a backseat to a bigger one - is the boy's journey one of self discovery or of self-invention.  <br />The end of \\"Cheese\\" seems abrupt and unsatisfying, and even hints at something we must have long realized - that all is not right in our hero's mind.  Still, the writing saves a surprise, detailing the depth and self-realization of the boy's delusion.  Though the book is written in easy prose for teen readers, I doubt anybody but adults will apreciate the web of mystery it surrounds itself with.  If you're left unsatisfied by the ending, you'll probably find yourself re-reading the whole book.  Lucky you.	2002-04-30

In the film and on TV, Logan was a cop, a \\"Sandman\\", in a future sybaritic utopia where nobody is allowed to live past their 31st birthday.  Set in a domed city where life was a paradise, \\"Logan's Run\\" offered only a single catch to the life of non-stop partying - retirement was fatal.  Runners, those trying to escape their fate and the City of Domes, are hunted down and killed by the Sandmen.  The film's Logan, like everybody in the city, has too much fun to worry about his oncoming 31st and, because everybody has the chance of \\"renewal\\" - a chance of survival offering more hope than a run from Sandmen.  Since nobody really escapes the sandmen, Logan sees no point to escape.  In both book and film, Logan undergoes some sort of transformation, and \\"Sanctuary\\" from his suicidal society by becoming a Runner.<br />Most things are different in the novel.  There is no City of Domes - Logan's society covers the Earth, so there doesn't seem any place to escape to. Instead, Logan seems to run from place to place, dodging his former partner, the Sandman Francis, but without creating the impression of getting anywhere.  Another big difference is the birthday cut-off: here it's 21.  (Think that those 10 years don't matter? Try asking a 21 year old; but don't expect an answer unless you're under 30).  The biggest difference of all is just why Logan becomes a Runner.  The jovial Logan of the movie becomes a Runner as part of the computer's plot to have him infiltrate Sanctuary - the asylum of successful runners.  Not quite enthused, Logan is forced to Run when the computer sets his \\"life-clock\\" to 31 years (he had a few years left and was prepared to enjoy them).  The book's grim and selfish Logan becomes a Runner simply because he's not ready to die.  Going to a party with other suspected Runners, he meets Jessica and convinces her that he wants to survive.  The twoshare various adventures and then fall in love in their search for sanctuary, all the while fleeing Francis who doubtless has plans to kill them.  They also have to deal with specific dangers at each stop - wild animals, dangerous Indians, historically accurate war monuments and a homicidal cyborg named Box.  Because the characters of the novel run simply for their lives, their journey doesn't have that aspect of self discovery that the film had.  Also, because the inhabitants of the book know more about their past than those in the film, there's no chance of our heroes surprising us with their discovery of the ruins of our age and clues as to how their society formed from our own.  The biggest difference is Sanctuary itself, which the book deals more directly with (and not as satisfyingly as in the film).  In short, the book is overrated and not a great read.	2002-04-26
US	49374774	R1DE57VGLGL1IA	0061091693	771198575	A Wild Justice	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A great novel...just not a great Craig Thomas novel	First off, I want to say how much I love Craig Thomas's writing, and I just know I'll come back  \\"A Wild Justice\\", but the book has flaws that won't be helped by a second reading.<br />THE PLOT:  Assassins murder the sister of John Lock, an ex-CIA officer.  Lock soon learns that the plot was actually aimed at his rich brother in-law, the corporate head of a company doing business in post-Soviet Siberia.  Unbeknownst to him, an executive of the company has already been found murdered in the remote Siberian town of Novy Urengoy, triggering an investigation by the local intel services.  Independently, both Lock and the Russian chief Vorontsyev link crimes to Turgenev, who heads the Russian end of the company combining with Lock's in-law, and both make the mistake of alerting their target.  While Vorontsyev struggles to keep his officers alive, Lock evades various attempts to kill him while he travels to Novy Urengoy.  When the two link up, they consider various underpinnings of Turgenev's plan - smuggled drugs or weapons - eventually hitting on a much darker conspiracy.<br />THE PROBLEMS:  Craig Thomas's writing is normally opaque, but that give's his plots greater depth. Unfortunately. The simple plot of \\"Justice\\" just seems undefined - we learn quickly who the bad guy is, and that he must be stopped.  While the plot hints at the more earthshaking aspects of Turgenev's plans, it never makes them clear enough to be scary.  The plot itself doesn't offer much tension because there is no sense of a deadline that must be made (like, stop Turgenev before the Russian Army arrives, or before a laser sattelite targets the space shuttle).  Also, Turgenev remains undefined because he's never given any real henchmen or colleagues like the tag-teams of other Thomas novels (Like Babbington and Winterbach of \\"Lion's Run\\"; Serov and Rodin of \\"Winterhawk\\"; or Kontarsky and his Soviet bosses in \\"Firefox\\"). Lock remains an enigma himself, without that checkered past of characters like Priabin and Mitch Gant.  While the plot isn't up to Thomas's previous standards, his belief-suspending plot-twists, unfortunately, are true to form.  Are we supposed to believe that Lock, already on the run at home, will risk going to Siberia alone?  While most Thomas books rely on recurring characters - Aubrey, Hyde and Priabin - \\"Justice\\" brings back only one character: the heroically defiant Vorontsyev who single-handedly halted a Red Army coup in the superior \\"Snow Falcon\\", but doesn't hint at his tenacity in this later book.<br />STILL: \\"Justice\\" offers a tight plot, likeable characters and Thomas's trademark prose.  Given that Thomas hasn't been writing as many novels these, we'll take what we can get, even a novel that seems only exceedingly superior to anything else being written, as opposed to his usual obscenely-better-than standard.  In short, a must for Craig Thomas fans.	2002-04-24
US	49374774	RQ4FPHQ1GFW45	068911110X	386295759	Vengeance 10	Books	3	2	2	N	N	War time Germany shoots for the moon	'Vengeance 10' is one of those what-if history novels, as in, what if the Nazis decided to surpass their grounbreaking work on V-2 missiles with a stab on a manned moonshot.  In this one, set during WWII, a brilliant though unbalanced German scientist teams up with Werner Von Braun to spearhead the German missile program with an eye towards outer space!  Meanwhile, a British spy who knows a thing or two about rockets, shadows the Nazi's missile research centers across wartime Europe, realizing ominous signs from the shreds of evidence he finds.  While the allies have enough trouble believing rumors of any Nazi rocket, and never believe anything the hero says, the heroic spy quickly realizes the scale of the Germans' ambitions.<br />Vengeance 10 sounded like a cool book, with a prologue that sets the stage for something big.  Unfortunately, the author, who obviously knows a thing or two about Germany's now legendary pioneering efforts in ballistic missiles doesn't tie himself strongly enough to the premise of the Nazi moon rocket, and the exotic idea of an alternate history takes a back seat to what looks like the actual (if fictionalized) history of Germany's missile. This violates the first rule of alternative history thrillers ' with Poyer's history paralleling actual history so closely, it doesn't seem like history will be changed, rocket or otherwise.  Much of the book details the paralyzing phobias of the British spy - he's a milquetoast from teh get go, and his plans to get the job done only get others in trouble.  Joe Poyer is so eager to show us what he knows about the Nazi missiles that actually flew by the end of the war, that he never really gets to the goods promised - the stuff that could have flown, but didn't.  Also, the plans themselves don't seem so earthshaking, and I spent much of the time thinking, so what if the Germans get the moon?  (The author makes clear just how outer-edge the German's technology was ' just reaching the moon was problem enough, let alone having the technology to exploit that)  Also, since the novel begins and ends with the war, covering years full of historical and technical detail, the story gets too bogged down to show that it's working towards something big.  None of the characters are real - whether the British spy who must find his courage or the German genius who throws himself into the lunar project to hide his disillusionment with the Nazi cause.  If you've never read any novels about the Nazi wonder weapons, this book is for you.	2002-04-18
US	49374774	R2KZCC92S3NFD	0553275569	678579754	The Right Stuff	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Wolfe's prose push the envelope	This non-fiction tells more than the story of America's race for space - but actually tells a deeper story: of America's push into the next frontier and how it discarded the heroes and heroism that led the way.  Beginning with the early years of the jet age - when jets were prone to disintegrate at transonic speeds if they didn't just fail, Wolfe charts the conquest of the sonic barrier by Chuck Yeager.  When the Russians jump the gun and pioneer the artificial satellite (and the nuclear-capable ICBM that lofted it into orbit) the US responds with its own programs - which fail miserably.  The triumph of Gagarin's and Leonov's space flights spur the Americans to use unproven and flimsy hardware, and respond with apparently less success.  (Unlike the first Soviet space flights which achieved orbit, the first American astronauts flew short suborbital missions; though superior technology allowed the west to loft satellites comparable to Sputnik but much smaller, conventional wisdom held the grapefruit-sized satellites as inferior).  Though military test pilots had been flying (and dying) in virtual anonymity for years, those chosen to fly the American rockets become national heroes before the first launch.  Wolfe parallels the civilian Mercury program that lofted the first Astronauts with the exotic but military X-15 program (which did not reach as high or as fast, but was at least flown by a pilot like an airplane) as if paralleling a more promising program with one that people were more interested in.  The distinction is between the heroism that the Mercury astronauts stood for, and the heroism X-15 pilots (who snapped up no book deals) actually embodied.<br />\\"The Right Stuff\\" is a triumph.  Though it doesn't tell the whole story of the space program, Wolfe sets up an ingenious theme.  The pilots and astronauts of the day were heroes, like knights of the round table, and the cold war was there crusade.  While this sense of the epic was an outgrowth of the end of WWII, the burgeoning missile and nuclear technologies meant it would soon become impossible to see the world in simplistic terms.  Though technology improved, those who developed or relied on it matured as well, shedding their addiction to the epic - John Glenn (whom Wolfe paints as a sincere hero) clashes with NASA bigwigs and never flies again (until the late 1990's), while Chuck Yeager assumes command of test pilot school, only to confront Kennedy-era political correctness.  The book ends on a bittersweet note - with Mercury giving way to Gemini, and the end of the X-15.  Wolfe describes these events and others as hallmarks of the cold-war's end.  No longer would American's fly in space solo like warriors of old, while the demise of the X-15 eliminated American warriors from spaceflight entirely.  Paralleling this were the Cuban missile crisis and the DC-Kremlin hotline.  There would still be a cold war but, divorced from its epic delusions, we would learn how to end it...eventually.  So profound was this change in mentality that, JFK's assassination at the crosshairs of a pro-Castro militant did not raise red-scare hsyteria.<br />\\"The Right Stuff\\" also triumphs because of its unique perspective of the time which seems to parrot the hysteria of the day without actually condescending to it. Through the book we see the world marvel at the illusion of Russian ingenuity (\\"imagine, they kept a man alive up there a whole day!\\") while remaining fatalistic about American blunders (\\"our boys always screw up!\\"  \\"Our rockets always explode!!\\")  Wolfe inspired a new school of journalism and history, but none have come close to matching this feat.	2002-04-14
US	49374774	R2YTY3QRGO9SGD	0060196319	442862530	The Shark Mutiny	Books	1	5	6	N	N	One star's too good for this mutiny	In this outer by the author of \\"Nimitz Class\\"  (and other books, \\"Nimitz\\" being the only one I've read), the Chinese collude with Iran to mine the Persian Gulf and send oil markets skyrocketing.  The west responds with numerous aircraft carrier battle groups, thinning out their forces elsewhere.  Before the west can learn that the mining of the Persian Gulf is a ruse - to trick them into leaving China Sea unguarded - the Chinese launch a massive strike on Taiwan.  Meanwhile, the US launches SEAL missions against the Chinese - the first at their petrol-refinery in the Persian Gulf, the second at their naval warfare complex in Burma - both resulting in heavy and unnecessary casualties.  Both missions involve insertions from the USS Shark, an aging nuclear sub.  Rick Hunter, the head SEAL and Dan Hedly, Shark's XO are boyhood friends from Kentucky, and when Shark's oddball commander belays an order that means life or death for the SEALs in both missions, Headly mutinys - a first in US history - to save both friend and mission.<br />This has to be one of the worst novels I've ever read. Besides some obvious spelling, factual or other errors (the AN-124 is repeatedly called an \\"Andropov\\", or Ruslan, which was the name reserved for the plane's record-breaking prototype; the real USS Shark not being a Permit or Sturgeon or ex-SSBN, but one of the older Skipjack boats which, by 2007, would be far older than 30 years old) or some questionable politics (Robinson lauds Ted Kennedy, unusual for technothrillers with their right-slant, but simply incongruous when his characters repeatedly refer to the story's villains as \\"chinks\\" and \\"towelheads\\"; the main characters explain the assault on Taiwan as centered on recovery of artifacts stolen by the Nationalists in 1949; the US military heads authorize an attack on China's Burmese port mostly because it symbolizes PLA expansion, never dealing with the complex morality that justifies our own power projection), there's Robinson's horrible writing - \\"his thoughts were clear and accurate\\", \\"vicious bullets\\" and my favorite \\"the M-60 rifle that could save their lives in an emergency\\", not to mention a hefty amount of words capitalized when force of character wasn't enough to connote force of will.  Then there are the characters. None of Robinson's characters appear in the parts dealing with the invasion of Taiwan, which gives that campaign even less an air of reality than the rest of the book.  Robinson's Iranians disappear shortly after their introduction, while the leading Chinese (who'd qualify for a Nobel were they able to pull off in real life half as much as they did in this book) disappear shortly after the climax of the battle for Taiwan.  There's a brilliant analyst who, for reasons the plot never deals with, has a striking aussie accent - but he's discarded (presumably until Robinson's next book) once the Navy heeds his warning of mines in the Persian Gulf.  As in \\"Nimitz\\" Robinson spends about as much time building background for his main characters as those who are dispatched soon after their arrival.  Then there's the plot gaps: Robinson seems as able to hold onto the details of his own story little better than I could.  Robinson creates a petro-shock, yet does little with it than mention price-hikes (life might as well be back to normal in the US and the rest of the world).  Chinese soldiers are on guard in Burma, Robsinson writes, because of the previous attack in the Persian Gulf, but the massive assault on Taiwan isn't even mentioned.  A shipment of mines is traced from Moscow to Iran via China, but the buildup of an invasion force headed for Taiwan goes completely unnoticed; again (\\"Nimitz\\" being the first time) Robinson has submarines ambush an American carrier without ever explaining how the subs penetrated defenses specifically designed to screen them.  In a book full of plot twists that suspend belief, anybody will be able to pick their favorite - though mine would be the America's overkill in dispatching 8 carrier groups to the region, a scale never explained, and one that leaves them vulnerable on many fronts.  The move is essential for the Chinese since it frees them to act on Taiwan, but Robinson never deals with why the Yanks so obliged the Chinese' plans, or whether Robinson's enshrined Adm. Morgan should take responsibility for doing so.  Instead, Robinson devotes the rest of the book to Headly's court martial.  Rather than a complex reason for the mutiny, Robinson cheats - the Shark's CO is a nut -  a spiritualist who communicates with the skipper of the Russian Sub, Kursk and  thinks he once lived as the ill-famed French commander at Trafalgar.  What clinches things against him is his refusal to go the distance during either of the Shark's SEAL operations, a move which all but proves fatal in each encounter.  Because Headley's heroism is so obvious. Navy leadership finds itself in the tight spot of prosecuting one of its own for an act of bravery beyond the call of duty.  The wronged CO, though painted a coward, eagerly presses the mutiny case despite what it may bring to light.  The resulting court battle won't  rank up there with the epic combat of \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" or \\"A Few Good Men\\", and the litigators just repeat the same themes- a nutty submarine commander against a valorous mutineer.  There isn't enough military detail to satisfy fans of Dale Brown or Coonts - just meaningless minutiae (like the names of warships introduced at the moment that they are destroyed, or about racehorses, of which you'll read more than you probably wanted to know) that nobody will accept as a substitute for plot.  The ultimate insult is the scorn the principals pour on the ignorant media, though Robinson's lack of credentials would put him squarely with them.  This was probably a bit much to write for such a poor book, but I gave this guy the benefit of the doubt after \\"Nimitz\\", and found my first opinion the correct one.	2002-04-07

While many navies have subs, the Russian's \\"Red October\\" adds a new wrinkle - though larger than many large warships, it can't be detected by conventional sensor technology of any country.  Her captain, Marko Ramius, is a diehard Soviet, the son of another diehard soviet, and the most formidable naval tactician in any navy.  But he's got a plan - conspire with most of the ship's executive officers (excluding the hated \\"zampolit\\" or political officer, and the ship's doctor who is \\"useless\\") and sail for the west and for freedom against the soviet empire that he holds responsible for his dead wife and cursed life.  He goads his former superiors, telling them of his plans (though fudging the details), causing the Russians to send every ship they have to sea.  The Russian mobilization triggers an American response, and soon there are enough warships in the Atlantic to allow a man to walk from Norfolk to Ireland without getting his feet wet.  The Russians aren't forthcoming but the Americans, knowing of the missing sub, can't take the chance that Ramius hasn't gone rogue with plans to lob his missiles directly at Washington.  Only CIA freelance analyst Jack Ryan, is convinced of Ramius's intention to defect.  From Washington to the mid-Atlantic, Ryan tracks the rogue Russian.  Coming from the other direction is Tupolev, captain of a Russian attack sub, an Alfa-class boat faster than anything else in the sea.  Worse, a saboteur is loose aboard the Red October, apparently aware of Ramius's plans, and determined to do keep the ship from making it to the west.<br />This first Tom Clancy novel had me looking for years for another one anywhere near as good.  (Only \\"Kill the Potemkin\\" matched it, and on a lesser scale).  Most books were satisfied to follow the treads of \\"October\\" without offering anything new.  Clancy fleshes out the now familiar lore of the naval technothriller - craven \\"political officers\\", \\"Crazy Ivan\\" and \\"cavitation\\" - that other books just mention.  Though Clancy essentially invented the genre, few others have learned the valuable lessons of this book.  The hero here is a bright and successful guy, but Clancy makes it clear how out of his element Ryan really is (he's no submarine commander, he fears heights and doesn't know what cavitation means; when Ryan finally meets Ramius, the Russian puts down one of his recent books).  Clancy also lards it up on details, but puts a fair amount of flesh on them as well - a Russian fighter pilot resentful of the Americans for their backing of Afghan freedom fighters (boy is this book old), an American watch officer who barely survived cancer - and knows how to draw the line between the back- and foreground.  He also spices things up with incidents between the Russian and Yankee fleets (a dogfight between an F-14 and a Yak \\"Forger\\") and a meltdown on a Russian sub, details jettisoned from the movie but which work here.  Even the double climax of the film occur as separate incidents (the gunfight in the October's missile room, and the submarine dogfight with Tupolev, but it all works.  Just about every technothriller author since 1984 has either been called the \\"new Tom Clancy\\" or used his name on their jacket-blurbs - all without any of them ever really replacing his name for their own.  This book is the reason why.	2002-04-05
US	49374774	R2Q789VXZ76CG	0553801368	947484554	Thunder in the Deep: A Novel of Undersea Nuclear War	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Secret Weapons of the Kriegsmarine	\\"Thunder in the Deep\\" is the sequel to \\"Deep Sound Channel\\", the first of a series about nuclear submarine warfare in the near future.. Both books follow the adventures (and sometime misadventures) of Jeff Fuller, the commander of the next-generation submarine \\"Challenger\\". Composed of a new age ceramic hull (something like the chobham armor they use on tanks), blessed with high tech sensors that can detect submarines because they are quieter than the surrounding waters, and armed with nuclear torpedoes, Challenger fights an undersea war against incredible odds. Only, the enemies aren't Russians, but a German-dominated Axis that seems to borrow the worst traits of the Nazis and the Kaiser eras, and seems to posess the technical know-how to hold the future. United with South Africa (where the war began in \\"Channel\\") and ruled by Kaiser Wilhelm IV, the new German empire dispatches fleets of U-boats into the Atlantic to cut off England. Now possessing nukes, and not afraid to use them, the 21st century Kriegsmarine turns whole convoys into irradiated dust on the sea. While most of the new U-boats are either merely potent but otherwise disposable (much like the ones in WWII - they all but insure death for their prey and crew alike) or ships stolen from fallen European nations (mostly France) \\"Deutchland\\" possesses the weapons, sensors, ceramic hull and reserve of the Challenger, and is commanded by the thoroughly ambitious, brilliant and evil Eberhard. Fuller, not entirely comfortable with his ship, finds himself tasked with one seemingly impossible mission after another. A rescue mission for a crippled sub turns into a covert deep-strike mission on a Baltic coast research facility. Between Fuller and his objectives are fleets of U-boats unleashing swarms of nuclear-tipped torpedoes. (A complex set of ROE limits use of nukes to warfare out in the open ocean, never dealing with the importance of the seas in the terrestrial food-chain.)<br />I wasn't set to like this book, but enjoyed it anyway. Though there's something missing - the new German regime doesn't seem as fleshed as the one in \\"Fatherland\\"; what's going in other theaters of war? - the action is non-stop and the plot turns rise above the technobabble and not-quite deep characters. This isn't the clean and sterile submarine combat of other books. A lot of the book reads like a movie, but it's a movie you'd probably want to see , offering everything from sub-warfare to hand-to-hand combat once the heroes make it to that hidden weapons lab. While the new type of submarine warfare - with its high-tech hulls and nuclear weapons - may not be realistic, the author crafts a complex science with all of its limits making it quite convincing without slowing down the plot. Also, for those who don't consider submarine technothrillers there chosen form of action, \\"Thunder\\" has our heroes embarking on all sorts of impossible missions.  (Sure, some of it seems to read like an elaborate video game, but most books compare poorly to games; \\"Thunder\\" does not).  I kept waiting for this book to lose me, but it never did.  In short, \\"Thunder\\" is a lot of fun.	2002-03-31
US	49374774	RDN924ZV30JR9	0312950942	446628880	Angel, Archangel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Great epic WWII thriller	Though this novel set in the latter days of the war seems to be about two British pilots intent on snatching the newest Nazi rocket fighter from its test center (hoping to get the better of both the Germans and the Russians) it soon becomes clearly about something else - a rogue Soviet general's plot to use chemical warfare to steamroll over both the retreating Nazi troops and advancing allied forces.  Learning of the plan, the British realize that the Nazi wonder-plane is their only hope for penetrating the heavy defenses around the Soviets' marshalling point.  From a not-so intricate plot, Nick Cook crafts a fairly epic novel of the air war and the dangerous days near the war's end, when one world war looked like it could be taken up by another.  He tosses in some cool stuff - the retreating Nazis who offer little resistance to the Brits (doubtlessly preferring them to the Russians), a British turncoat, the rogue soviet, various one-shot characters and the fancy whiz-bang planes themselves.  Rather then show the war guided in measured and coolly contemplated steps, \\"Archangel\\" shows how the best-laid plans of its main characters never come off as expected (the traitor hopes to bargain his freedom from the Brits using his information, not knowing the strings they will attach; without giving away too much, our heroes find they must steal two Nazi jets; suddenly everybody realizes too late why the worst way to destroy a planned chemical weapons assault is to destroy the weapons), one of the many reasons you'll want to read this thriller in one sitting.	2002-03-27
US	49374774	R213A5W82K9UOI	1857800990	126031898	Soviet X-Planes	Books	3	10	10	N	N	Unique yet dissappointing untold history of Red Aviation	On the plus side, this is almost as comprehensive a book as you can find that goes between the cracks of Soviet aviation development, turning up all sorts of interesting machines.  Unfortunately, this is also as comprehensive a book as you can find given that cold war security strictures have made it hard to get the crucial bits of information.  We should be happy that we can even get such information about airplanes like the Sukhoi supersonic bomber obviously patterned on the American B-70, or the family of airplanes which bore and then descended from the MiG-21 (including one using a rectangular chin inlet and canards making it a dead-ringer for the Eurofighter Typhoon, but preceding that plane by about 25 years).  Though the book offers much information that you would not have seen found, the gaps are conspicuous.  The book is not without avoidable flaws notwithstanding the unavailability of information: the structure is all wrong, giving each plane its own little section and going by alphabet, rather than crafting all the information into a single historical narrative that could have offered clues into the missing history.  (There are two reasons I can think of to explain why there are no pictures of a promising prototype in flight, or why the prototype itself can't be found: either the first flight went off badly, or the plane was never built at all.)  By describing each plane as if in a vacuum, the author cuts away, most of its story.  Military hardware historians know that the story of one warplane frequently includes the story of another - the B-70 including the story of the B-52 and the U-2; the F-111 interdependent with the F-14; The F-86 and the MiG-17 - so it makes no sense to devote single sections to one airplane or a family of planes.  Also, the author gives no dimension to the Soviet acquisitions process that determined which planes would get huge production contracts and which would remain just one-shot test-beds.  (The Soviet experimented with thetailless delta design in their Tu-144 airliner, even going to the point of modifying a MiG-21 with a tailless delta as a flying subscale analog, but never went that much farther - why not?)  And none of the narrative describes what it was like to fly these beasts.  Still in all, a book of some great and overlooked history and some great pictures to go with them.	2002-03-25
US	49374774	R2URH1VUJA4HV0	0060914416	136921810	Running Critical: The Silent War, Rickover, and General Dynamics	Books	3	18	20	N	N	Only three-stars because story ends too quickly	This is a comprehensive account of the contentious genesis of the Los Angeles Class attack sub, a warship normally described as one of the most advanced in the world, but under suspicion here.  Though this story will most likely appeal to those familiar with the terminology and technology of military submarines, it also has much to offer for those studying the military acquisitions process.<br />The Los Angeles class attack sub was borne of attempts to combat two implacable enemies - the Soviet Navy and America's own Hyman Rickover, the so-called father of the nuclear navy.  Facing the combined soviet threats of submarine launched anti-ship missiles (previous Russian subs could only fire their missiles only after an elaborate process while on the surface where they were visible and vulnerable) and faster submarines equipped with more powerful reactors, American planners now find themselves desperate to reclaim an edge on speed.  (Though setting the benchmark with the Skipjack class, progressive gains in the size and weight of latter subs using the same powerplant eroded this advantage).  The switch to a newer reactor (actually one redesigned after use on the USS Long Beach, one of the world's first nuclear-powered surface ships) wasn't enough, and submarine vets had no choice but to make compromises, like reducing hull thickness and conseuqently reducing maximum safe operating depth.  Conflict with the headstrong Admiral Rickover occurs when the winning design for the new sub is chosen by a firm other than General Dynamics, the established industry leader.  Also complicating things is Takis Veliotis, a wily genius who is the only man who can stand up to greedy corporate reps eager to cut any corner and Rickover himself.  Veliotis, unfortunately, has some of his own secrets to hide, resulting in his flight to Greece to avoid charges stemming from millions of dollars in kickbacks.  What nearly dooms the program are the extensive compromises made to the construction schedules - resulting in ships being launched half-finished only to be quietly returned to the factory for completion.  Millions of dollars in overruns are quietly overlooked, with the hope that a government bailout will convert these losses into profits.  When that prospect begins to look unlikely, the corporate heads of GD begin turning on each other, while unskilled and unreliable labor, low morale and impossible construction schedules mix to spell the likely doom of the US submarine force.<br />This book tackled an unlikely subject - the LA Class is the backbone of America's submarine navy, not something you've heard described as essentially \\"Unsafe at any depth\\".  However, the book is marred for two reasons - the author spends much more time concentrating on each specific transaction or exchange between characters (like Veliotis and either the head of GD or Rickover) without connecting these exchanges into a cohesive picture of a collapsing defense program.  A more glaring flaw is the book being incomplete.  \\"When it was over, there were just the submarines\\" but the submarines managed to operate at much higher safety standards than the Russian boats they confronted - the author never connecting these boats to the seeming time-bombs produced by GD.  What had happened?  Who can take credit for the success of the LA Class - or is even that perceived success an illusion?  Even the supreme irony of speedy submarines is never addressed adequately, though the information was probably unavailable.  Though developments in sub-launched missiles and their submarines themselves did substantiate the need for faster US subs, the threat of high-speed Russian subs was a cold war mirage.  The Russians never gave much production priority to their high-powered reactors.  Those installed in experimental versions of the November and Papa classes, and regularly in the Alfa class proved more trouble prone than realized.  Though more compact than comparable western designs, these reactors were at least as loud, and, using molten metal as a coolant, had to be operated around the clock, even while in port, lest the coolant be allowed to \\"freeze\\" into solid metal and ruin the piping.  Either of these two ommissions (the post-construction history of the LA class and the real threat posed by the Russians) is fatal to the subject.  Nevertheless, I found it important reading.  I'm hoping the author will revisit the subject again using the information he had no access to at first.	2002-03-24
US	49374774	R2HZI2O6UIPXHN	0006161995	624197436	Hunter Killer	Books	2	2	2	N	N	No hunt or kill	\\"Hunter Killer\\" tells the story of how two RN war heroes manage to perfect and launch a new and potentially revolutionary form of rocket engine.  Actually, the narrator is along for the ride - reluctantly - as the US navy closes in on them.  It seems that the inventor and expected passenger of the missile also happens to be the vice-president of the United States.  When the president falls ill, the US engages in a mad rush to locate the missile's inventor and prevent the launch of the new rocket.  The narrator's friend, a fellow vet from the RN's submarine service, isn't about to see his hard work hit any snag - so he commandeers the rocket and shanghais the inventor and the narrator, and has his crew run about the Indian Ocean hoping he can set a good launch site for the missile before the Americans catch up.<br />This story was a bit of a dissappointment - the author gets all the geography right and makes sure that the cuisine enhances the flavor, but the plot itself seems underdone.  The mad-race to launch the missile and elude the Americans seems over the top.  Also, the cold war pressures seem completely missing, though you'd think they'd have much to do with the development of the nifty rocket.  The biggest disspointment was how the book passed itself off as a submarine thriller, but our heroes leave the submarine fairly quickly and don't exactly exchange it for anything as fun.  The \\"Hunter Killer\\" of the title may refer to the hero, who was a hunter killer of ships and crews in the war, but seems pressed to do more than just escape his pursuers now.	2002-03-22
US	49374774	RKIL7QY7Y7DS9	078600388X	260442190	The Lucifer Crusade (Wingman)	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Lame techno-adventure	This was the first and only \\"Wingman\\" book I've ever read, a sort of straight, pulp techno-thriller series set in the aftermath of WWIII.  (The US is still picking itself up after narrowly surviving an overwhelming Soviet attack; colluding politicians undermine the bare victory while the nation's splintering into numerous, autonomous zones further prevent it from taking action; global disintegration allows the rise of numerous freemens' armies and an every-man-for-himself mentality).  Hawk Hunter was one of the US's most gifted fighter pilots prior to the war, and of course its only chance for survival in its aftermath.  Flying the only known remaining F-16 fighter, and hitched up to the Pacific American Air Force (who largely fly lesser planes like the F-4 and the Tigershark) Hunter remains the only pilot capable of beating back America's enemies.  In this episode (I mean, this book), Hunter flies to North Africa on the trail of the evil Viktor Robotov, a Soviet madman largely responsible for defiling both Hawk's nation and his girlfriend.  Leaving Casablanca, Hawk links up with a group of British adventurers, self-styled modern knights on a crusade against a shadowy warlord known as Lucifer.  All of North Africa seems desperate to get out of the way as Lucifer amasses a huge army to conquer that part of the world.  Hawk quickly realizes that the feared Lucifer is actually Robotov in disguise.  Against Lucifer's army, the modern knights claim the intact, if powerless derelict of an American aircraft carrier, planning to tow it across the Mediterranean to become a floating airbase from which to fly against Lucifer at the mouth of the Suez in what promises to be an epic battle....    ...that never comes off.  Because I enjoyed \\"War Heaven\\" I thought I could also like at least one of the \\"Wingman\\" books, but this one spoiled me for the whole series. None of the action has that \\"you are there\\" quality - and even when describing action occurring right then, the book sounds like it's talking about something that happened last week.  The characters walk around like bloodless robots. The evil Robotov, when we finally meet him here, is the biggest cheat of all: just a moron in a dark robe ala \\"Darth Sidious\\"; the sort of dumb jerk who blames other people for his own mistakes and has to shout everything.  (Why not make him Hawk's father while we're at it?)  Then there are the military details and the action - the techno details are pretty thin and the air combat not quite thrilling. Let's face it, even if you didn't pick up this book for its hardcore military/techno-realism, you'll still be left hungry.  Other technothrillers are out there with less implausible plots (not involving post WWIII war torn lands ala \\"Red Dawn\\") with more accurate detail, so why buy any of these books?	2002-03-21
US	49374774	R2JOY49I91P5NB	089141343X	942697045	Rules of Engagement	Books	2	3	5	N	N	Lousy rip-off of "Flight of the Intruder"	\\"Rules of Engagement\\" tells the story of an heroic fighter-driver flying Phantom jets during the Vuetnam air war.  Brad Austin, an Annapolis grad and the latest in a long line of loyal US servicemen broke with tradition when he joined the Marines instead of following his fathers into the Navy.  Over Vietnam, he chafes at the politically-initiated, and overly restrictive rules of engagement (\\"ROE\\"), watching enemy pilots pick off US fliers while shielding themselves behind the ROE.  One of the best aviators in the Marines, he flies his way and barely stays within the ROE as he targets an enemy ace responsible for the deaths of many US fliers.  Soon fed up, he plots one illegal flight which will clearly go over the line.    WHY THIS IS THE WORST BOOK ON THE VN AIR WAR: I gave this novel the benefit of the doubt, even though it quickly proved itself to be no better than an over-glorified and under-inspired rip-off of the far superior \\"Flight of the Intruder\\".  The more enjoyable characters and irony of that other book made it the best novel of its genre.  \\"Rules\\" drops the ball where \\"Intruder\\" got it right, taking a heavy-handed stand on the ROE (they deserve their bad rap, but Steve Coonts wasn't afraid to see the issue from both sides), while not going into great depth about the mechanics of his hero's machine of choice - the F-4.  Next to Jake Grafton, Brad Austin is as lively as an action figure - Weber unwilling to give him any of the flaws or introspection  that made Jake Grafton so believable; Austin's back-seater remains a captive passenger and nowhere near the equal of \\"Tiger\\" Cole.  Even the promising idea of having Austin romance the daughter of an anti-war fixture goes nowhere. (I kept waiting for the unhappy dad to tell Austin how he disapproves of his daughter's dating a guy who may get shot down, leaving the poor girl to wonder for years whether he was dead or rotting in a tiger-cage.)  Instead, Weber loads us down with details that don't do anything tosubstantiate the plot. Austin is a maverick of his family because he chose to fly for the Marines instead of the Navy, a plot twist that's supposed to establish him as a rebel, even though it has him flying the same planes from Navy ships like a Naval Aviator, and facing much of the same challenges.  Even the climactic flight, the one that will break the rules, is a cheat.  While books like these don't mind chiding wartime planners for choosing a strategy that has nothing to do with winning the war, \\"Rules\\" easily settles on an epic dogfight against the shadowy Communist ace, one whose result won't have the least effect down on the ground where the war was grinding its way through an entire generation of 19 year olders.  Coonts at least chose a target his characters felt was attached to the war's larger purpose (the Communist party HQ), didn't mind using a plane a whole lot less sexy than the F-4's in \\"Rules\\", and granted his characters sufficient self-doubt to question the wisdom of their actions.  Also, there's something a tad dishonest about a book that fights against the insane restrictions of ROE, yet never has its main character get anywhere near having to answer for breaking them.  If you must read a Weber novel, read the sequel: \\"Target of Opportunity\\", also an uninspired novel, but one with amore original plot.	2002-03-13

A team of government investigators searches for a shadowy genius capable of altering flight-navigation systems used by most large airliners, and obviously capable of bringing them all down. (When the mystery hacker blackmails the government, a few crashed planes are tossed in as a convincer.) Meanwhile, we meet Bo Kincaid, a grizzled veteran fighter pilot whose mastery in the air survived several wars abroad and incipient racism at home. Much of Bo exists as no more than flashbacks that occur thruought the book, and lack any apparent connection to the underlying story - flying Mustangs with the Tuskegee Airmen in WWII and Phantoms over Vietnam. In between learning of Bo's life, the reader watches the fitful and unproductive search for the extortionist whom investigators soon label \\"Captain Marvel\\". The investigators quickly hit on Florence Hartzig as the perfect expert to trap Marvel, but can never seem to locate her. <br />It would be generous to say that this book crashes and burns - generous because that implies that it ever got off the ground. Nothing much happens, but we're supposed to think that the author has done her homework and crafted expert characters, even as they don't do much during most of the story. (the author spends more time showing us how smart they are than he does having them get to the bottom of the mystery; in short, he spends so much time making them all geniuses, that he never makes them convincingly smart).  We get the usual cast of characters - brainy and brawny hunks who know the system and how to work around it, and the rest (stand ins for us) as the idiots who'd be lost without them. Author Lee Gruenfeld puts her heroes' experience solving a myriad of issues both relevant (how airliners navigate, how extortionists use ATM machines) and otherwise (why Psychics aren't as reliable as they appear; why the media was wrong when it chastised the government over the Pentagon's $60 hammer). \\"All\\", more than many other books, is painfully in love with its sheer gobs of useless knowledge irrelevant to advancing the plot or developing the characters who wade through it. Unlike a really good book that grabs a hold of you from the first page, \\"All Fall Down\\" is sort of like some annoying guy you'll meet on an airplane and won't let go until you've heard everything he thinks about every subject he knows.	2002-03-06

Operating from their highly secure base on the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Russians aim their weapons with impunity.  The only chance for the west is the EB-52, a highly modified B-52 bomber using stealth, new engines and next generation electronics and weapons - probably one of the few planes capable of destroying the Russians' base, and the only one stealthy enough to get the job done and survive without starting WWIII.  Flying from their secret base, \\"Dreamland\\", the hastily assembled crew of the EB-52 is essentially alone.  (A terrorist strike forces their early departure, and the project and mission alone are each too secret for them to call out for help).  Not until they reduce the deadly Russian base at Pavaznaya to ashes can they risk returning home.<br />Though I'm not a hard-core fan of Dale Brown, this was still a good read, getting enough mileage to stretch over to a few books.  \\"Old Dog\\" contains all the elements familiar too anybody whose read some of the past 15 year's worth of Brown novels (the bad guys either come up with some massive technological threat or otherwise threaten geo-political stability; this generally coincides with some new technological innovations of the west) when the idea was new.  Also, being Brown's first novel, \\"Old\\" lacks the extraneous and redundant references to older books.  <BR>It's sort of like watching the pilot episode of a show that has long since fallen into a rut.  Here, the characters seem fresher, the scenes un-recycled and novel itself is more tightly focused on the main characters (latter novels treated the fighting characters like toy soldiers on a board-game map, while the real action happened in generals' offices or in Oval Office).  If you've read one Dale Brown novel, you might as well have read them all, but this one still stands out.	2002-03-04

Commander Robert Bellamy is a former navy fighter pilot who lost the love of his life to some greasy tycoon (he&#8217;d been too busy fighting in aVietnam).  Now in intelligence, working for his military mentor, Bellamy is tasked to track down witnesses who saw a UFO crash in Europe.  Finding the UFO is really a weather balloon, Bellamy and a Russian assistant find members of a tour (from across the world) who saw the incident convinced it was the real thing.  While the &#8220;weather balloon&#8221; story seems true, Bellamy never realizes that each of his witnesses is murdered shortly after he interviews them.  The final segment of the book has Bellamy running for his own life &#8211; the last of the witnesses have been offed &#8211; across Europe.  His hunter is the shadowy &#8220;Janus&#8221;.  Meanwhile, a mysterious visitor who may know a thing or two herself about the incident, walks aimlessly across Europe.  <br />While this may be the stuff of a true cross-over hit, pedestrian prose, cardboard characters and a climax that looks like it was written up as an afterthought show that this book would be a miserable failure in any single genre, let alone several.  Sheldon once claimed that he never wrote about a hotel he never slept in or a meal he didn&#8217;t eat &#8211; which is why his books sound more like travelogues than novels.  His brief description of the history of &#8220;Top Gun&#8221; (Bellamy was a fighter pilot) is not only laughably off  (Sheldon has Bellamy flying A-6 intruders which were NOT fighter planes) but seems to have no other purpose but to &#8220;show&#8221; that Sheldon knows a thing or two about techno-military details (whoops!!).  Next is Bellamy himself &#8211; supposedly chosen for the mission because of his skills, even though he doesn&#8217;t begin to rely on them until he&#8217;s running for his life.  Of course everyUFO-conspiracy tale needs a conspiracy &#8211; normally a deftly executed one like that headed by the cigarette guy on the X-Files.  This group is just power-hungry &#8211; there&#8217;s no real mystery to their intentions or why they fear the aliens.  (For that matter, there&#8217;s little depth to the aliens&#8217;s benevolence.)  Sheldon seems to think that nobody&#8217;s covered this ground before &#8211; let alone with better style and substance.  If you need something along these lines, Payne Harrison&#8217;s &#8220;Forbidden Summit&#8221;, an imperfect book, is still better than this excuse of a novel, or just catch an episode of  &#8220;The X-Files&#8221;.  Just put this book down and forget you ever heard of it.	2002-02-17

Actually, nobody knows where it leads, only that it's other side doesn't exist in our own world, and that only living matter can traverse it.  When the completed needle is saboutaged by right-wing fundamentalists, the doorway expands to swallow up an entire city block.  A small town of (now naked, and not just of clothing) normal people, men, women and children find themselves alone and someplace other than Maple Street, USA.  Not knowing if they are on Earth of a different time, or have been catapulted to another universe entirely, they band together to create a semblance of civilization with the intent of building a crude version of the needle, one that can send them home.  <br />This was one of my favorite novels, but I can't hide its faults.  A large part of the book isn't concerned with the sci-fi aspect of the plot as it is with the efforts of the displaced to re-learn metallurgy, chemistry and stellar navigation.  The eligious fundamentalists come off as a bunch of rubes, but the ending is uplifting for all and redeems the story.	2002-02-11

In the film, Sinatra and crew accidentally happen upon the sunken but intact U-Boat, a WWII relic, and come up with the idea of using it to hijack the liner Queen Mary.  In this novel, the characters hunt the U-Boat down, learning of its location from the WWII U-Boat ace who once served aboard it, with the intention of hijacking the Queen at the start.  The U-Boat itself is older in the book than the film - a WWI relic here - and a jury-rigged arrangement using car batteries barely substituting for the boat's originals allows the crew only a single short dive.  The biggest difference between book and film is the brat-pack, devil-may-care attitude of the film.  The moral ambiguity of the film's main characters are substitued for otheriwse upright if flawed characters in the book, lured into the plot less for the prospect of riches than adventure, and another crack at driving submarines without a six-year hitch.  Author Jack Finney highlights this with the hero's girlfriend, a pure minded and loving woman the hero knows he'll have to lose.  He can't bear to have her chained to him when his prospects of a life on the run are probably a sure bet.  The moral darkness of the German character stand out even further.  Though lacking the snappy dialog and jazzy score of the film, the adventure of the story contrasted with the unadventurous characters is something not to miss.	2002-02-11

Already rich on the strength of his drug smuggling enterprises and his 3rd world petroleum sales, Kazakov triggers a war in the Balkans as a ruse to building an oil pipeline through Albania.  With the Balkans disintegrating, the Russian army pours across the border, ostensibly for peacekeeping, but mostly to pacify those who'd stand in Kazakov's way.  Once complete, the oil pipeline will guarantee the Russians millions of dollars in petro-income daily.  Kazakov, who's despised enough by his own countrymen, relies on back-room deals in general and in particular (because this is a Dale Brown novel) on a fantastic and mysterious stealth warplane that swoops without warning and unleashes destruction.  (Rival Balkan factions blame each other  for the attacks).  The mystery plane is the Metyor-179, a sort of descendant of the Fisikous-170 of the earlier Brown novel \\"Night of the Hawk\\".  In the US, a new president (who makes his habits clear by skipping such traditional functions as the public inauguration and traditional state of the union address) abruptly cuts military ties with the rest of the world - pulling out everything but a shell of the American presence from Europe and leaving a power-vacuum the Russians are only too happy to fill.  At Elliot Field, site of the high-technology aero-weapons training center (HAWC), Pat Mclanahan (Dale Brown's perennial hero) is working hard not only training his own combat unit but also foreign units who will now be expected to defend themselves without overt American support.  Ukrainian units in Backfire bombers train alongside Turkish F-16's and HAWC's very own EB-1c Vampire bombers.  The situation is tenuous enough, but when a deep-cover CIA agent in Russia uncovers proof of Kazakov's links to the Mystery Plane and the escalating violence in the Balkans, HAWC is sent in on the rescue.  The catastrophic results set off an international incident and lead to a near court martial of Mclanahan.<br />It's a big, complicated story, one that manages to elude Dale Brown's story-telling talents with every page.  Besides his usual faults (giving greater depth to machines and combat elements than the people) is a glaring new one: most of Brown's books are linked in a rough series based on the exploits of Mclanahan and others at HAWC, and Brown has no problem freely revisiting past events of those older books in the newer ones.  Tossing around references to books like the original \\"Flight of the Old Dog: and \\"Night of the Hawk\\", reading a Dale Brown novel is like reading another issue of some superhero comic book where every other plot reference has an asterisk reminding you to review last month's issue of Avenger's or X-Men.  Even so, Brown leaves some threads untreated, as if he were sure he'd have time to deal with them in his next book (the torment of ex-POW Dave Luger and his interaction with a Ukrainian officer who had victimized him in a prior book is such an example).<br />That said, Brown manages to repeat his typical mistakes - putting techno-jargon and other meaningless minutiae above the action, and disrupting the flow with more meaningless details.  Brown can't so much as have a tilt-rotor MV-22 land (deep inside Russia to extract the spy) without going into an extended treatise on where its unit is based and who builds it, and providing a dossier about the crew.  A Ukrainian Backfire bomber can't turn on its radar without triggering a volume of information on how the American pullout from Europe will leave Russia free reign over much of Europe.  Brown will repeatedly refers to a character by his full name and title as if he wasn't sure he'd made them memorable enough when first introduced.  (Colonel-General Smoliy of the Ukrainian Air Force is repeatedly referred to by that full title and his position).   Many details are flat-out unnecessary- does a Dale Brown fan need to be told that F-16's are being launched with AIM-9 missiles and shells for their internal guns?  Brown gets some good jibes in with his new President - a former war hero turned new-age hippy (he extols meditation).  Brown's new pres manages a great twist in an outrageous bid to win freedom for American fliers captured during the botched spy-extraction, and he leaves enough room for readers to argue both sides on the subjec of the continued worldwide American military presence.  The rest of the book doesn't live up to that promise.  The Russians sneer, while our heroes' bureaucrat superiors rant about how the heroes aren't team players.  The villain is just another overly-ambitious sleaze.  There's plenty of action, but little coherent plot to stitch it on.  There's a great action sequence involving the futile attempts to escape Russian airspace after the nearly ruined rescue, but it's hobbled.  I don't care how experienced Brown is at military flight - his flight sequences are horrible - he barely establishes POV for his characters, frequently allows his characters to engage in full dialogue that doesn't hint to the stress of their high-performance flying and often merely summarizes what should be a heated and fleshed-out battle, but in Brown's flat prose, comes off as detailed and vivid as some late-1980's style flight simulator game.  Although Brown pushes his reputation for \\"realism\\", he includes some exotic new stuff that makes his writing look as unrealistic as ever (electro-ray guns, cybernetic armor) and has yet to make the more real stuff (existing hardware like airplanes) seem realistic.  Brown has got to realize that techno-thriller fans are more savvy than they were in 1987 and has got to do more than recycle the same plot over and over again.	2002-01-16

With it's revolutionary sonar systems, and armed with warheads capable of unleashing EMP, America has the power to bring any modern power to its knees. The America is barely out of port when the sub is hijacked in a daring (and bloody) daylight assault.  The impact of the successful theft compounds a bad month for the US government, one already spoiled by the fiasco of the botched launched of an SDI system - after the ruined launch, the remains of the SDI platform are missing.  Soon, the America's hijackers use the sub's high-tech weaponry to level Washington and New York.  Using EMP warheads, the big cities are left intact, but darkened - as if thrust back into a pre-electric age.  The economy verges on collapse (good news if you bought Euros) and only Admiral Jake Grafton can do anything about it.  With the help (or perhaps hindrance) of an ex-KGB spook, the Marine Commandant (Flab Le Beau, introduced in the novel \\"Intruders\\") and a CIA employed safecracker named Carmellini (Introduced in \\"Cuba\\"), Grafton races against time to link the hijackers with the missing SDI satellite and various shady types including some European businessmen and the beautiful owner of a NJ-based dot-com that weathered the e-collapse by diversifying into hacking secure government computers.<br />Better than \\"Fortunes of War\\"?  Sure.  And it was the first techno-thriller I'd picked up in ages (missed \\"Hong Kong\\").  So what's wrong?  Coonts doesn't really solidify the complex story which includes a three-way conspiracy and plenty of techno-stuff. Also, the pirate crew of the \\"America\\" never really come together to form their own subplot (no pun, really!).  They're a bunch of eastern types led by Kolnikov, an ex Red Navy sub commander reduced to driving a Parisian cab, and Heydrich, a cold-blooded assassin.  The crew is frequently at odds with each other, but there's nothingmore about them - they could have as easily gotten their own story but didn't.  Coonts never does anything with the spectacle of the nuclear submarine commander reduced to shuttling tourists out of Orly Airport and around the Eiffel Tower, or even into the history of a guy who played \\"Blind Man's Bluff\\" thruought the cold war.  The biggest problem with the novel is trying to understand what the massive conspiracy is even about - it's never clear why the plotters need the sub, and only the sub, to recover the missing satellite once Admiral Grafton concludes that salvage was the idea.  Grafton argues that it's the satellite itself that needs to be recovered, even though those responsible for the crime could have easily stolen the plans for it, and wouldn't have had to go to the trouble of hijacking a nuclear sub to get them.  (In the late 1960's to produce their own fighter plane, the Israelis resorted to an elaborate plan to steal a warehouse-full of blueprints for an airplane they already had).  \\"America\\" lacks any fun characters like those in \\"Intruder\\" or even \\"Cuba\\" and Coonts' writing moralizes endlessly about bureaucrats (all the unpopular characters are compared to bureaucrats) and left-wing politicians.  There's one great flying scene - with F-16's chasing Tomahawk missiles at low altitude - that doesn't so much make up for the rest of this boring book as much as remind us what a better book it could have been.	2001-12-18
US	49374774	R1D1B944TQ70WD	0385486944	116329023	High Concept	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Shallow bio of a supposedly shallow producer	Yes, Don Simpson, as in Simpson-Bruckheimer, the creative team that did much to shape how movies are made.  From the early 1980's, Simspon-Bruckheimer produced a string of incredible hits - \\"Officer and a Gentleman\\", \\"Flashdance\\", \\"Top Gun\\" and the Beverly Hills Cop flicks - that seemed universally derided yet implausibly popular.  While Jerry Bruckheimer seems to be the man who dealt with the nuts and bolts of production, this book credits Don Simpson with the brainstorms that turned uninspired treatments into blockbuster films (like casting America's favorite black comedian to star in a police-action movie originally slated to star Sylvester Stallone).  True to its title, this book focuses on the now late Don Simpson who seems literally to have died of excess (sex, drugs and food).  More than the story of the films he made, \\"High Concept\\" tells the story of Simpson and how he came to Hollywood from unspectacular origins to become a star himself.  When that dream proved impossible (he cast himself in a key role in one of his own flicks - virtually all of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor) and his own status as a power-player seemed diminishe, the excesses that had already become an established part of his life came to dominate it entirely.  Simpson's weight yoyoed, wrecking his metabolism and compounding the strain inflicted by narcotics.  Drunk driving accidents and a notorious addiction for hardcore sex further helped wreck Simpson's already suffering career.  By 1995, Simpson was on deathwatch, and his ultimate overdose seemed less of a tragedy than release.<br />\\"High Concept\\" is actually two halves of two different stories, much in the same way that Simpson was half of two different people.  First there was the Don Simpson who helped turn an incomprehensible script into a pop-driven blockbuster (\\"Flashdance\\") and solidified the importance of hit soundtracks for films that aren't really about music.  Then there is Don Simpson the creep, ceaselesslyvain and pathetically vulnerable.  The second Simpson munches on junk food at all hours of the night, hires prostitutes for S&M, drops in and out of rehab and endlessly pines for the big break that eludes him.  Despite the big money he earned, Simpson clearly understood that his was only one more level under the true power players.  Resentment and reams of cash helped fuel Simpson's fatal addictions.  Unfortunately, Fleming does little to flesh out either of these two people.  Simpson and Bruckheimer's earlier successes were unlikely in the sense that they were a surprise even to those who made them.  Fleming does little to illuminate the creative processes behind their films, though it's unclear whose fault that is - Fleming's for giving short shrift to a man with a shrewd sense of the American moviegoer, or Simpson who was both simply uncreative and lucky for a very long time.  Instead, Fleming seems to want to skip what he must think is the stronger part of the story - the one about Don Simpson's late-night binges of rough sex and Ring-Dings.  <br />Fleming gives each half too little focus, because he believes that each is part of a singular whole -  that Simpson's story is merely an extreme example of what happens in Hollywood all the time.  (Hollywood offers everyone the illusion of a chance to reinvent themselves, and an endless reservoir of addiction and pain for the point after the illusions are dashed.)  But I'm not convinced - Jerry Bruckheimer continued churning out monumentally successful flicks (\\"Armageddon\\", \\"The Rock\\", \\"Bad Boys\\", \\"Crimson Tide\\" and \\"Pearl Harbor\\"); Nobody seems to think that Hollywood powerhouses Speilberg and Lucas are trapped in a coke and alcohol fueled nightmare; The worst of Simpson's excesses appear when his career as a moviemaker seems about over.  Fleming seems to chart the flop \\"Days of Thunder\\" as the point-of-no-return.  A glaring disappointment after the success of \\"Top Gun\\", \\"Thunder\\" was to mark Simpson's acting debut,playing one of Tom Cruise's NASCAR competitors.  Instead, editing revealed the stark limits of Simpson's talent for both acting and self-invention.  But the two Simpsons never become one, and Fleming's anecdotes of Hollywood as Babylon aren't as illuminating as simply lurid.  Ironically, Fleming's book seems a failure because it follows the traditional Simpson/Bruckheimer model too closely - an unending stream of mindless pleasure without direction or substance - but not so close that it's anywhere near as poignant as \\"An Officer\\", as funny as \\"Cop\\" or as high powered as \\"Top Gun\\".	2001-12-10

A web of complex (and suspicious) financial transactions involving futures-trading on Kindle County market run by Hartnell has whet the interest of the US Attorney's office, itself run by a foe of Stern.  Though Hartnell is the sort of guy who routinely seems to hover at the edge of indictment for something, the charges now offer the chance of landing the embattled broker in a federal lockup and, because Stern's son-in law works for Hartnell, threaten to tear at the fragile Stern family.  Into this mix of family and legal problems, Turow throws in Stern's romancing of his enemy at the US Attorney's office and of a nearby neighbor, his suspicions harbored against a neighbor who may have had an affair with Stern's now dead wife, and the story of his own romance, years ago, with Clara Mittler-Stern.  <br />\\"Burden\\" has Scott Turow's great prose and obsessive character dissection, but it's not as enveloping a book as \\"Presumed Innocent\\".  The sense of an underlying secret isn't as enticing as the murder investigation in the earlier book, and the characters don't grab you as well either.  Most annoying is Stern whose silver-tongued erudition was cute when he was a supporting character in the older book.  Dixon Hartnell would have been a more interesting choice of main character, but the plot makes that impossible.  Turow dangles the names of characters from the first book just toget our attentions (ex-PA Ray Horgan almost becomes the defense lawyer for Stern's embattled son in-law; Rusty Sabich is referred in passing as \\"Judge Sabich\\";  the specter of the corrupt Mayor Augie Bolcarro seems to hang like a smog over Kindle County) but remains it's own book.  Even the fictional choice of legal venue seems troublesome - exchanging the Kindle county court in \\"Presumed\\" with the anonymous Federal Court here.   Kindle County, which seemed so real and unique in the older book seems just another mid-west city.  The nivel concentrates instead on the byzantine relationships of its main characters, but after you've finished, you wonder why you should care.  This is a pretty good novel, but it loses something and suffers in comparison to its prequel.	2001-12-05
US	49374774	R1W0UW68CYFGAO	0671744666	671982108	Prime Directive (Star Trek)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Excellent Trek novel	Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise stands accused of violating one of the single most central tenets in Star Fleet procedure - the sacrosanct Prime Directive prohibiting Star Fleet personnel from manipulating the course of history on other planets.  The Enterprise had been monitoring a world whose saurian inhabitants stood on the edge of thermonuclear war...when something happened.  When \\"Directive\\" begins, the Enterprise is adrift, battered and gutted - practically derelict and dead in space - because it got to close to the planet when war broke out.  In an apparent attempt to prevent the war, the Enterprise may have caused its outbreak.  Now the crew has been driven into hiding, the population of the federation roundly holding them responsible for the nuclear holocaust that had engulfed the promising population of that alien world.  (Except for Chief Engineer Scott, whose presence is needed to bring the Enterprise back to life).  Now Kirk and his crew work their way across space in disguise, trying to get back to the Enterprise, to reclaim their ship, find out what really happened, prove their innocence and perhaps even save the remnant of the battle-scarred world.<br />\\"Prime Directive\\" is probably one of the best \\"Trek\\" novels I've read.  Apart from Trek stories written for war-gamers (in which detail is paid to ship class, weapon specs and rank), \\"Directive\\" focuses on space exploration, and manages to toss in both alien anthropology and even a sci-fi mystery into the plot.  The story develops well, and the author wisely builds up the characters without worshipping them like in most Trek stories.  The technobabble is light (the author has a gift with the pseudo-science of the 23rd century and manages to craft his Enterprise in a way that makes it look sophisticated, the creation of brilliant engineers).  Forget those novels that rehash old episodes, boldly read this instead.	2001-11-29
US	49374774	R3BY0MXBBDWIEO	0879386630	145883093	The Fighter Pilot's Handbook	Books	2	1	1	N	N	no surprises here	The title seems very ambitious, almost like the sort of textbook that a potential fighter driver might get when transitioning to the vaunted USAF fighter/bomber track of undergraduate pilot training.  Unfortunately, \\"Handbook\\" isn't really sure what aspect of fighter combat it wants to talk about.  The author tells the story of air combat, from SPADs to the Rafale, gives a survey of famous fighter planes, chooses a favorite, adds in some articles by other authors about some more contemporary airplanes (for now anyway), adds some fighter pilot stories, poetry, songs and even excerpts from an unpublished novel.  The only base missed by the author is trying to give the reader a sense of what it's like to fly one of the monster jets in so much as a landing pattern, let alone in even mock combat.  Instead, Roberts is more concerned with basic aspects of the airplanes than those who actually fly them.  The book starts promising enough - with the author recalling a training session with a very promising student, only to leave the sensation of flying and those who chase it far behind.  (Another clue as the author's misplaced focus is found in the excerpts of the unfinished novel - set in central Europe in early WWIII - his characters seem completely anonymous, not even interchangeable with the characters in other aero-technothrillers.  Sure it's a work-in-progress, but the writing places inordinately greater emphasis on the plane than it's pilot.)  Another problem is the information - anybody who's looking at this book isn't likely to find anything they haven't seen before, or have their perspectives shifted at all.  (Are any fans of military aviation left who still think that the MiG-29 is simply a cheap copy of the F-18 and F-16 with simpler avionics?)  Roberts deals with the basics of the most famous fighter jets (American and Russian, with a necessary mention for the Tornado; the Mirage jets rate barely a mention despite its extensive combat history.  Why the author settles on those jets on which he focuses is unclear.), and much of what he says sounds way too laudatory.  For once, I'd like to hear somebody explain why the F-15's performance overcomes its weight, complexity, price and large size, or that the F-14 had suffered due to the development problems of the early military turbofans.  That is, the world doesn't need another word about how great the F-16 is - so why not a word about what problems our pilots experience trying to fly them.  What seals it for me I show dated the book is - whether it's the unqualified praise the author heaps on the jets or the unfinished novel of the NATO-Soviet conflict, Roberts writes as if he were stuck in 1987.  If you're looking for the story of fighter aviation, look elsewhere.	2001-11-14
US	49374774	R3ABFPC1Q3VK5S	0440082218	125553097	Spyship	Books	1	1	2	N	N	Something's fishy here....	The spyship of the title is the mysterious \\"Mary Castor\\" a trawler built and launched with great fanfare from an working class British port town, and then mysteriously lost.  The story has less to do with the ship than the investigative reporter who will stop at nothing uncover the secret of her loss.  There are some clues - pictures of the ship's antennae and its not-quite-regulation electronics - and some interesting background info (the North Sea area in which Castor trawls is also rife with Soviet Submarine activity).  While the mystery takes the book to solve, it's obvious from the start that something bad is going on, something so serious that the government (British at least) will do anything to keep Castor's fate a secret.    So why is this book so bad?  It may have to do with why this book is so unbelievable.  The charachters aren't quite paper thin, but they're all losers - weak and timid on the inside where it counts, and the book never resorts to subtext to reveal those weaknesses.  The writer goes to great pains to show how just about everyone here has some mixture within them of bitterness and timidity - whether it's an amatuer detective who's on the verge of uncovering the secret, or the chairman of a commission looking into the official cause of the Castor - each seems to think that the world has cheated them out of something, yet both lack has the slightest idea of how to get it back.      As \\"Spyship\\" is meant to be a thriller, the Government hires a freelance killer to maintain their cover-up - even though there's no chance that the civilian investigators will ever uncover the truth behind the disappearance.  The hit-man aspect of the story is so strikingly implausible compared to anything else in the book - only there for the action, and that only makes things worse.  (The hero is a reporter, yet he manages to succeed where others fail in neutralizing the seasoned killer).  And let's not forget the mystery.  Ofcourse, the author had - and the story never progresses to the final discolsure.  Instead, the charachters meander around until they discover somebody who can answer the questions for them.  So much for investigative journalism.  If you want to read about true tails of nautical intrigue, pick up a copy of \\"Blind Man's Bluff\\" or \\"Project Jenniffer\\".	2001-11-11
US	49374774	R3N4NH3V977MF	0671008803	755801273	Spectre (Star Trek)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Star Trek again confronts the Mirror Universe	Star Trek Spectre<br />Set in the &#8220;Next Generation&#8221;, &#8220;Spectre&#8221; reunites James T. Kirk with the crew of the Enterprise-E.  (spoiler).<br />Unfortunately, an ambitious plot is brought down for many reasons.  First, this is Shatner&#8217;s book, made obvious by a conspicuous lack of heroism and foresight on the part of Captain Picard.  (Picard uses the Enterprise main computer to lock out the invaders, yet is easily tricked into unlocking it for them.  The NextGen characters spend much of the time as helpless prisoners).  Also, it takes a while for the heroes to get anywhere (Kirk and company spend an inordinately long time just trying to get out of a holodeck).  The Mirror villains plan itself doesn&#8217;t really have any menace &#8211; the 5th column seems scary, but the plot doesn&#8217;t really do anything with them (we only know that they exist because of the typical NexGen techno-bable, in this case, quantum-signature anomalies), while the plan to steal our universe&#8217;s technology is also pretty lame.  The mirror enemy doesn&#8217;t seem very centralized either, with the wicked Tiberius not casting much of a shadow over the story.  (It would have been nifty to take the same approach that Robert Harriss did with Hitler in &#8220;Fatherland&#8221;, keeping the Fuhrer just out of sight where the menace was greater.)  The very need to look for enemies in another reality is also a cop-out &#8211; what&#8217;s wrong with our own Cardassians, Klingons and Romulans?  The point of the Mirror Universe is that we got to see wicked versions of our own favorite characters, but the story doesn&#8217;t do much with the evil Picard, and the Mirror Spock isn&#8217;t really good or evil, just tired of the fighting. But what really kills this book is the ending&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t have one.  Instead, it ends on a cliffhanger, the authors thought that they had enough for two books, not knowing there wasn&#8217;t enough for this one to really stand onits own.<br />Fun for Trek fans, but I doubt anybody else would have the patience.	2001-11-09

In the fourth Star Trek film, the earth was menaced by a powerful, apparently benevolent yet unwittingly destructive probe.  We never find out that much about the probe, except for its interest in whales as the dominant life forms of earth.  In this sequel, the probe makes another appearance, this time upsetting relations between the peace loving federation and the Romulan empire.  The crew of the Enterprise is sent to investigate, roughly cooperating with the never trustworthy Romulans.  In the course of the story, the crew learns much about the probe and its interest in sentient and aquatic life forms.<br />From a weak premise (built on another story), Margaret Wander Bonanno (I love that name) spins a fun story.  The charahcters are good (including the Romulans who could just as easily be dismissed as sly villains) and the prose are crisp.  But most of all is the probe which the author cleverly conceals in mystery even as she reveals it.  A good read for non-Trekkers as well.	2001-11-02
US	49374774	R14HS316V2FHZJ	0812579259	606443502	The Keep	Books	1	6	30	N	N	not really scary	This is a dreary novel, thin, neither very thrilling nor scary.<br />The Keep refers to a mysterious ages-old fortress in the remote Transylvanian Alps, the heartland of Romania's folklore. The purpose of the Keep and it's builders are a secret even to the inhabitants of its neighboring village. Each brick in the Keep carries an inlaid brass and nickel symbol resembling a crucifix. Nobody has been able to spend so much as a night in the Keep - nightmares interrupt sleep. That is, until the Spring of 1941 when the German army, fresh from its victories in Western Europe, marshals its forces for an eastward stab. With the nearby Dinu Pass a likely route for a German advance into Russia, the Keep becomes an obvious staging point, and the book opens with a unit of Wehrmacht troops moving into the silent fortress. Then German soldiers begin to die at the rate of one very night, their throats torn out, one man completely decapitated. Their commander, Captain Woermann is no lover of the Nazi cause, (which is why he's been sent far from combat, to Romania) yet has no choice but to call upon the hated SS. The Wehrmacht soldiers have no love for the SS troops who they feel are over-glorified executioners in dress-gowns - good for nothing but murdering large numbers of unarmed jews, gypsies and other undesirables, while the einzatskommando of the SS look down on their less than racially pure-minded comrades in army gray. When the gory deaths continue, both the SS and the Wehrmacht turn to Theodore Cuza, a crippled Jewish academic who has made study of the Keep his life's work. With Magda, his beautiful yet morose daughter in tow, Cuza is brought to the Keep to reveal its secrets for the Germans. The Keep, instead, reveals the embodiment of its evil to the professor, naming itself to Cuza and offering an alliance of sorts with him against the Germans. Meanwhile, a mysterious stranger, Glen, journeys across the Mediterranean to the Keep. On arrival, he strikes up a relationship with Cuza's daughter, but it's the monstrous resident of the Keep that he's really after. The stage is set for a battle between the enigmatic Glen and the dark resident of the Keep.<br />...and it's still a horrible novel. F. Paul Wilson doesn't put much effort into writing a scary book. The resident of the keep, shadowy at first, eventaully reveals itself to Cuza. There are hints that the monster is being less-than open, but the \\"true\\" story as told by Glen isn't much scarier a revelation. (Wilson merely swaps one not-so-scary tale for another).  Both Glen and the evil Molasar's version of their shred story hint at being the source of the vampire legend, but neither version becomes more than a generic derivative of it. Wilson merely swaps one not-so-scary story with another, and neither one is revealed in a way that generates chills. Another problem is the scary parts themselves - there aren't any. German soldiers drop like flies, but there's nothing scary about serial insecticide. The victims themselves seem no more defined than the anonymous soldiers who drop like flies in Chuck Norris movies, and those aren't scary either (unlike the people who repeatedly and compulsively watch them). Hard pressed to advance the plot while the soldiers die but before the climactic battle (and with the monster already revealed), Wilson creates conflict between Cuza (who sides with the demon with the idea that the monster, for its evil, can do the world a favor by turning Nazi Germany into his next feeding ground) and Magda (who trusts Glen's more ominous description of the demon and its motives), but nothing comes out of that. Then there's the final battle - let's call it the anti-climactic battle. Finally, the most critical error - the Nazis are supposed to be scary, but they're not. Wilson hints at the Nazi's atrocities, but the Nazis themselves aren't that scary, obviating the irony of one monster meeting another.  With the war in its early stages, the Nazis have just begun their death-campaign , one that will rival for terror any of the vampire legends. The SS commander had been on his way to Ploesti, the site of a massive Romanian petro-refining complex. (The large number of rail-way junctions necessitated by the oil refineries also make the site an ideal one for building a new death camp, one to rival Auschwitz), but there's no hint to the inhumanities the SS commander has seen or contemplates, no hint of irony at the methodical annihilation of SS troops mirroring the death unleashed by those same SS. The Nazi's were the real vampires of Europe, but these blackshirts seem less competent than those you'd see on an episode of \\"Hogan's Heroes\\". If you want chills, rent John Carpenter's \\"Prince of Darkness\\", but keep this off your shelves.	2001-10-23
US	49374774	RKQVZ1ANBAO3D	0385475969	557168734	Nest of Vipers	Books	1	7	14	N	N	This is the worst book ever written.	Sarah Jensen is young brilliant and mysterious, just the sort of person the authorities need to penetrate a byzantine conspiracy involving the global currency market.  However, the conspiracy is just the tip of a deadlier plot, one that will take any step needed to protect itself from disclosure.  Okay.....<br />This has to be one of the worst books ever written.  The author injects much experience into her character - perhaps too much.  (like her heroine, author Linda Davies is a striking and apparently successful currency trader).  The book is written not only for those who understand the dynamics of currency trades, but really care beyond the obvious implication that the millions at stake are really important.  For the rest of us, Sarah is just a cardboard character, surrounded by jealous colleagues who desire her for her looks and envy her knack for amassing a lot of money in a short amount of time.  The facets of the conspiracy are poorly  defined.  The novel really never starts at all - just cuts between various shadowy characters who stand to make or lose fortunes, and will stoop to anything.  Davies spends much time on telling us how unsavory some of these types are, but doesn't really care about what they do.  What really stands out is how seriously Davies takes not only the premise but her storytelling skills.  This is just another example of the sort of thriller we can thank Grisham for inventing - the guy who discovers that his lucrative but humdrum job actually veils something dark and interesting.  Instead of lawyers, we have currency speculators.  I suppose accountants are next (hey - CPA's sent Capone to Alcatraz!!).  As long as readers are willing to believe that an author's experience on any subject is adequate substitue for storytelling - willing to accept minutiae in place of narrative - there will always be writers ready with books so enwrapped in meaningless technicalities that we won't realize how bereft of plot they really are.  Absurdly pedestrian prose don't help.  If I were in the business, I'd say this book was pegged to some defunct former east-bloc currency.<br />I'd suggest something lighter, like Po Bronson's \\"Bombardiers\\", a sort of M*A*S*H set in a San Francisco bond house where the most certifiably crazy brokers are also the richest.	2001-10-18
US	49374774	R2JMC2AJDBPL9R	0517551888	309027655	Iron Eagle : The Turbulent Life of General Curtis LeMay	Books	3	31	39	N	N	Bio that misses the mark	This biography of Curtis Le may is fairly comprehensive and favorable to its subject, the pilot who rose from being a lowly officer at the dawn of America's entry into WWII, to command the nation's military forces at the brink of global thermonuclear war.  Le May's ideas on air strategy bucked existing tactics (like how aircraft are grouped, or use of evasive tactics during their attack runs), but results (at least in comparatively minimal casualty rate sustained by his B-17 unit in Europe) raised his fortunes.  Soon sent to the Pacific to command a unit of the trouble-prone B-29, Le May's star rises even higher, setting the stage for his post-war commands of USAF-Europe, SAC and USAF Chief of Staff.  His greatest post-war accomplishments were turning SAC from a shell of a command into a global-ready air arm. (Coffey dwells much on SAC's sheer absence of security, and the mock attacks by ersatz saboteurs - engineered largely by Lemay himself - who left notes like &quot;there is a bomb in the suitcase I left in the hangar; it is set to explode at 6:05 am.&quot;)  When taking over SAC, Lemay tested the unit by staging mock attacks with the rules stacked in favor of the attackers - and the results were still dismal.  From turning SAC around, Lemay was primed for his tempestuous tenure as CinC-USAF.  As the iconic cold-war air force boss, Lemay's frequently clashed with his boss, Maxwell Taylor (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs) and the civilian administration (personified by Robert McNamara).  Hot topics were the military policies of &quot;gradualism&quot; in Vietnam as well as procurement of the joint-service fighter, the F-111, and manned bombers to replace the B-52.<br />Unfortunately, whether or not you're familiar with the subject of this book or air warfare in general, you're likely to put it down feeling like a lot is missing.  In generally historical terms, &quot;Iron Eagle&quot; seems insufficiently critical of Lemay.  Even if you're predisposed to favor Lemay, the book will still sound like apologia.  Coffey writes constantly about how the general was misquoted on such subjects as the use of nuclear weapons in Korea or Vietnam or the no-1st strike policy, without satisfactorily explaining what the general did mean or the context in which his statements were made.  Also, though taking Lemay's foes to task for being inaccurate in quoting him, Coffey remains a bit inexact himself.  McNamara and his circle at DoD are repeatedly called \\"Whiz Kids\\" (probably because of their reliance on burgeoning information technology, statistical analysis and other space-age ideas in decision-making) so often that it seems that Coffey believes that that was their official name.  At times, it's not clear what the source of the misquoting is - whether deliberately created or innocently spread by Lemay's enemies.  Historically speaking, Coffey spends more time re-telling history than placing the historical weight where it belongs.  In WWII, bombers fly missions, absorb losses and burn down Japanese cities, but never conveys the gravity of these missions on those who flew them or were targeted by them.  Coffey deals slightly with the use of the a-bomb against Japan because Lemay didn't think the bomb necessary (the war was nearly over, and Lemay had accomplished his primary goal of whipping the buggy-prone B-29 into shape), but this is still a huge error.  The consequences for the next world war (which loomed closely even as the existing one still raged) together with liquid-fueled missile technology proven by the Germans meant that aviation technology was about to take a massive turn.  It's impossible to believe that the bomb itself, used in combat, would have little interest for him.  (On a more practical level, having learned of the bomb, security reasons forced Lemay from flying any more combat missions.)  Lemay's fliers themselves withstand not only brutal combat conditions but brutal training as well, but Coffey, though repeatedly stressingthe training, doesn't dwell much on what that training was, what standards Lemay set, and how he observed them.  After the war, Coffey similarly charts the General's political battles, but the gaps are obvious.  The general is popular on capital hill, we're told, but little else on those warm relations.  (Coziness with congress seems only a counterpoint to the thinly-veiled hostility Lemay received from the White House).  The pivotal issues in this period involve both the Cuban Missile Crisis, procurment of a sucessor to to the B-52 and a multi-service fighter, and the manned bomber v. missiles controversy.  In Cuba, Coffey goes little further than telling the story without getting to the egos underneath.  Neither the fighter (soon to become the F-111) nor the bomber (the eventually cancelled B-70) rise above being the issues of budget battles in Coffey's pages - their merits as aircraft seem to have escaped him entirely, and one wonders whether we should be grateful that the government eventually against Lemay's advice (the F-111 evolved into a superb multi-role strike fighter, while Lemay's B-70 would have been made obsolete by high altitude missiles and interceptors.  The debate over missiles and manned bombers is also a murky one - Lemay seeks both manned bombers and missiles for the nuclear triad, and this middle-ground is never explored.  Also neglected are the B-47 and B-58, the controversy over the Northrop Flying Wing, the non-use of B-36's over Korea, advances in air defenses, or any mention of Russian innovations.  Lemay's tenure covered those years reckoned as a golden age for military aviation, but Coffey seems to miss that entirely.  None of the aircraft really come alive in Coffey's pages.  For all of its size, \\"Iron Eagle\\" says less about Curtis Lemay than you'd find in a few pages of William Anderson's memoir \\"To Fly and Fight\\".  In that book, the author recalls having to brief the General on the troubled parasite-fighter program.  \\"That's the craziest idea I've ever heard, crazier than any of that stuff that comes out of Edwards Air Force Base......but keep working on it.\\"  If only the General edited this	2001-10-17

So large and complex it requires two men to fly, the F-14 is one of the most powerful airplanes in the sky.  How many times have we heard a story like that?  Yet &quot;Punk's War&quot;, set in the ominous skies of the Persian Gulf, is still a cut above your usual aero-technothriller.  The flyboys here are tired, not wired.  Instead of the adrenaline soaked yet duty-bound pilots of other books, these guys are so beaten down by the system, by their clueless superiors and the rigors of naval aviation that they actually question the sanity of their remaining in the navy.  Most of the charachters are known only by their callsigns.  Author Ward Carrol (who flew as a radar intercept officer in the backseat of an F-14) wisely avoids making his hero, the titular &quot;Punk&quot;, the squadron Top Gun - that distinction best belongs to &quot;Smoke&quot;.  While Smoke best deserves command, he actually takes his orders from &quot;Soup&quot; Campbell, whose background in the &quot;Blue Angels&quot; and &quot;Top Gun&quot; mask an incompetent leader whose glory-seeking will put the other squadron members at risk.<br />Though none of these charachters really ring true, they ring loud - Carroll is more interested in them than the machines they fly, something you'll see from few autrhors today.  This had the makings of the most original story in naval aviation since &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;, but what hobbles the book is its own size.  It's painfully underfinished, as if Carroll suddenly grew tired of it.  The ending is way too pat.  A shame, but still a worthy read.	2001-09-28

Once brutalized by American soldiers, Cazaux now deals in weapons that will be used against all Americans.  On the brink of capture, flying a cargo plan full of ammo, Cazaux accidentally bombs an airport.  Realizing how defenseless airports and American cities are in general, and how much havoc he can raise when he wants to, Cazuax sets off on a terror campaign using airliners stocked with explosives to bomb airports.  The government responds by stationing Patriot batteries around airports, but Cazaux finds a way past those as well.  The only man who can end the reign of terror is Ian Hardcastle  the sort of strident, no-nonsense genius that drives all of author Dale Browns books.  (Usually, the starring role is given to Brad Elliot of Flight of the Old Dog and its sequels).  Hardcastles biggest obstacles arent left by the wily Frenchman, but by the government bureaucracy, the liberals and the week-kneed administration that reflects all that is evil of the Clinton administration.  (Though I think Chains of Command was more overt...against the Clintons).  Unfortunately, this has got to be one of Browns weakest books  though most of them fall into a pattern (geo-political crisis erupts just as some innovative USAF officers perfect a new secret weapon), this one just has random destruction.  The only hint that the plot is proceeding anywhere is the ferocity of the attacks and the cover-art on my copy showing what looks like Air Force One on a direct course for Washington.  Double-unfortunate is how this book will likely be resurrected over the next few weeks to cynically cash in on todays coordinated terror attacks.  Nothing else in this book really deserves the attention  Cazaux is as typical a demented villain as Brown can create while his followers are suitably mercenary in their motives.  When it looks like the plot after a massive climax near the end  will dust itself off and begin anew, the supporting cast of villains take matters into their own hands, as if theyve had enough of this book.  Benefit from their experience, and read something else.  For massive slam-bang Dale Brown, read Fatal Terrain (sorry, havent read Warrior Class yet).	2001-09-11

Deighton proceeds to cover the families of the crew, other crew members and their superiors before cutting across the channel to the enemy - night-fighter pilots, their controllers in German air defense, various suspicious characters from across the spectrum of Germany's military - from \\"respectable\\" Luftwaffe and Wehrmacht personnel to shadowy types from the \\"Abwehr\\" and the SS. We also meet the civilian residents of Altgarten, a Ruhr-area town nobody would think of bombing, but which manages to get plastered all the same. It's mid-summer 1943, when \\"Joe for King\\" is sent into the Ruhr as part of a massive night-time raid against the industrial centers of Krefeld. Lacking night-vision goggles, RAF pilots drop their bombs on targets marked by flares left by directing aircraft - in this case, specially equipped Mosquitoe night-fighters. When the marking aircraft for the Krefeld raid is shot down too early, its flares are released over Altgarten. This error is compounded by inherent flaws in RAF tactics (like targeting bombs in the center of cities, where bombs are more likely to hit civilian homes than factories and military installations), and the town becomes the unintended target for the massive strike. \\"Bomber\\" is to RAF's wartime bomber command what \\"Traffic\\" is to the DEA - a story of massive scale borne by wide cast if characters that never stops growing. Deighton doesn't let something meaningless as nationality get in the way of determining who is good or evil (the Germans get the bombs here, but Nazi genocide also gets prominent mention, with plenty of nasty Waffen SS to remind us why people were fighting). On the British side, we see officers acting less like gentlemen than soldiers. Political correctness is the rule (this is the country that gave us \\"1984\\"; \\"Joe for King\\"'s commander is suspected of incipient Bolshevism - it's very name hints at Stalin). Those who won't fall in line risk being labeled as LMF (Lacking Moral Fiber) - officially branded as cowards. Though books with such a command of detail normally favor the efforts of those they depict, Deighton is uniformly negative on the subject, a tone reinforced by his many subplots. Lambert, \\"Joe for King's\\" rebel pilot, plays the best cricket in Bomber Command - leading his odious superior to compel his participation in an upcoming tournament on pain of getting LMF'd. (Worse - the commander puts pressure on Mrs. Lambert after her husband has departed for the big raid). The bombers fly from Warley Fen, a once verdant field seized from its original owners who now stare at the airfield, mourning for what they know they will never have again. In Germany, ADF is managed by August Bach, an aged warrior preparing to marry his young son's nanny, not knowing how her youthful looks have made her the target of vicious rumors through Altgarten. The pilots of a night-fighter squadron (nichtjagdeschwader), preparing for a feared RAF attack on the Ruhr, are thrown into turmoil when Abwehr and Gestapo appear in search of a stolen classifed memo. The memo, it turns out, details hypothermia experiments on concentration camp prisoners (this may be same memo mentioned early in Robert Harriss' superb \\"Fatherland\\"). The corrupt assistant to Altgarten's Burgomeister arranges for the downgrading of the town's remaining Jews (from 1/3rd to 2/3rd \\"Jewishness\\" - though these jews are even more likely to face deportation and certain death, they will have greater freedom to marry other jews). Altgarten itself is flooded with profiteers funneling goods looted from conquered parts of Russia and the Netherlands. It seems that war is the only thing keeping the world safe because it occupies all the amoral typed who have to fight it. The only morally just adults are the TENO - the civil safety personnel who dig people out of bombed buildings. Because they are stationed in Altgarten, they get the biggest break: when the raid comes, they have the shortest commute. With so much going on, you just know you're bound to miss something. This is the sort of book that speed-readers hate. You'll probably lose count of all the characters that Deighton throws at you, though this doesn't hurt the plot as much as make the book one you'll want to re-read.

Carol Harmon, a beautiful and brilliant marine biologist conducting research in the Canadian Arctic discovers ominous signs of massive radiation poisoning emanating from points unknown.  Strangely stricken blue whales are the first clue.  Two divers Harmon sends to investigate sustain horrific radiation poisoning, only confirming the danger.  Essentially alone at the top of the world, she calls her ex-husband, ex-USN officer Brock Garner, for help.  Garner, himself conducting some research of his own in the Antarctic, travels pole to pole to help Harmon track down the source of the mysterious radiation slick and perhaps devise a way to stop it.<br />Compelling?  Sure, at first.  So much so, that it's easy to look past the book's pedestrian prose and cardboard characters.  Unfortunately, the novel fails because the characters never really do anything to solve the mystery.  Though Harmon and Garner and brilliant and surrounded by a supporting cast of geniuses, they never actually discover for themselves the source of the unexplained radiation slick.  Instead, they follow the trail to a mysterious polar oil-rig that doubles as a covert intelligence guard post.  There, they meet a USN officer who \\"solves\\" the mystery by telling the heroes where the radiation is coming from.  (Why the ominous Commander Krail couldn't tell all when he first met Garner early in the book is the biggest mystery of all).  Until then, Harmon and crew steam around the Arctic sharing with each other (and us) all that they know about radiation, nuclear weapons, the environment and marine biology. A story about the world being saved by a motley band of geniuses who are both brilliant and clueless at the same time could have been a great page-turner.  Instead, Powlick seems to buy into his characters' intelligence, even as their smarts seem to get them nowhere. In short, Powlick spends so much time trying to convince us that his characters are brilliant that he doesn't actually make them very smart.  <br />This becomes plainly obvious early in the book when Powlick reveals how little he credits his own readers - the way he tells the history of nuclear weapons as if none of his readers had ever watched a Discovery Channel or History Channel documentary is just one example.  For another, there's the story of a homey Ukrainian village that the character Zyubov had last seen in the mid 1980's.  The chapter ends with the stunning revelation that the berg was destroyed by Chernobyl, as if readers couldn't make the connection themselves (radiation...Ukraine...1980's.....hmmmm).  All marine biology are referred to by their scientific names (the blue whales are repeatedly called Balaenoptera, a move meant to be correct even as the bland prose do little to convey size and mass of the earth's single largest life-forms)  Even the choice of supporting characters' names - Wigner, Groves and Teller - seems excessively arch for an inside joke (the real Wigner discovered how substances used to suck-up radiation produced in sustained chain reactions frequently release that energy as heat; Groves was the General in charge of the \\"Manhattan Project\\" - Paul Newman played him in \\"Fat Man, Little Boy\\"; Teller invented the H-Bomb).  There's even a chopper pilot named Tibbits, but his helicopter is not nicknamed \\"Enola Gay\\".  Even the glossary at the book's end - once used but now long abandoned by authors of techno-thrillers - shows how out of touch it is; much of the terminology seems unnecessary, as if they were used simply because doing so justified the glossary.  But nothing highlights how poor a story this is than the threadbare plot.  Once the heroes learn the source of the radiation, an ambitious plan is put into motion to contain it.  Powlick drops a bombshell with a subplot involving sabotage that isn't so much a surprise twist as it is simply incongruous.  There's a de-facto villain, who seems to have been created simply for a short and unexciting bout of mortal combat indeep-sea diving suits lifted straight out of James Cameron's \\"The Abyss\\".  Very little in this story seems original and none seems worth reading.  Imagine \\"Smilla\\" without those darkly appealing characters and the heroine's icy narrative and you've got an idea of how much a waste of time this story is.	2001-08-23

The sole survivor of the ship has spent decades trying to forget the Candlefish - his feelings of guilt mixed in with the general shame that seemed to accompany him before the Candlefish met its weird fate (he was not the best submarine officer a sub-skipper could have asked for).  When the Candlefish surfaces mysteriously in mid-Pacific decades later, completely deserted yet otherwise preserved, an ambitious USN officer hits on the idea of repeating the fated sub's last cruise.  The idea seems like a lark - there's no chance of discovering what's happened to the crew and if there were, they'd be kn no position to avoid their fate, right?  When the sole-survivor, now a professor trained at Scripps, reluctantly comes along, things go wrong and quick.<br />&quot;Ghostboat&quot; has a lot in common with &quot;Thin Air&quot;, also by Simpson and Berger.  (That other book also involved modern-day naval officers re-visiting an unexplained WWII-era mystery, namely, the Philadelphia Experiment).  Here, the mystery seems more inviting, but the pay-off isn't as satisfying.  There are both sci-fi and supernatural overtones used to hint at what happened to the crew of the Candlefish, but neither jibes well with the other.  Worse is the focus of the book - which starts with the young NIS officer who proposes repeating the mystery sub's last cruise, but then shifts to the POV of the sole survivor.  Either charachter would be perfect to use as a source of mystery, but the authors spoil things and use them both - eliminating what could be a great source of menace.  By the last page, you're confused - the book seems painfully under-written.	2001-08-15

Ready to try anything, the Navy takes a stab at a mysterious project involving radar invisibility. About 35 years later, navy vets who had served on a ship used for testing radar-invisibility gear are still fighting a private war - on involving shell-shock, memory blocks and periodic trips to Navy doctors. A US Navy investigator, as a favor to his ex-wife, looks into the plight of one of these former sailors, and manages to step into a web of deceit surrounding a highly classified wartime project called \\"Thin Air\\". As the former sailors mysteriously die off, our hero begins to realize that \\"Thin Air\\" was not one of the countless dead-end projects pursued by a desperately besieged America, and that the project may have survived the end of the war, with ramifications so profound that those who have kept the secret will do anything to keep the lid on....<br />This is a suspense novel \\"inspired\\" by the legend of the so-called \\"Philadelphia Experiment\\", in which a Navy destroyer escort (depending on who you talk to) either achieved invisibility or even teleportation during highly secret tests on a destroyer escort based in the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1943. The tests were based on an un-exploited aspect of Einstein's Unified Field Theory which links together light, electromagnetic force and gravity (plans called for generating a huge magnetic field to bend light rays away from the ship.) According to the legend, the experiment worked but had some way-out and ultimately dire conseuqences that continued plaguing crewmen even after the experiment was finished.  Some sailors materialized inside of solid objects like walls when the generators were shut down.  Others continued to \\"wink-in and out\\" afterward, either becoming invisible or even dematerializing.  Some were said to have disappeared for good, like one sailor reportedly walked through a wall and was never seenagain. As the story spread, interplanetary travel and even aliens came into play. (With Watergate and \\"Close Encounters\\" fresh in public minds, just about any paranormal-conspiracy theory was possible, but time-travel seems like an idea made up for the dissappointing movie.  However, as the legend grew, it evolved further, \\"spawning\\" a parellel legend of a contemporary project in time travel called the \\"Montauk Project\\" which claims to have \\"rescued\\" sailors trapped in temporal flux since 1943.) The problem with the legend has always been that too little of the legend actually comes from those who've claimed to have witnessed it - with virtually all of it based on speculatoin. (Another whopper is that those who claim to have seen the destroyer wink-out of Philly, were on a Liberty ship moored nearby - so much for a highly classified experiment!). <br />\\"Thin Air\\", a detective story centered around the Philadelphia Experiment, takes an unoriginal idea and actually churns out a good story.  At the heart of the story, the authors craft a hero who's nobody's fool, and doesn't begin to buy into the legend until he starts seeing proof for himself - those truly enraptured by the myth of the Philadelphia Experiment believe in it too easily to make for much tension.  If anything, the Philadelphia Experiment gets such a good treatment, that the book's worst error is glaring - it's a thin story that's over way too soon. Just when the hero is on the trail, he manages to track down one of the project's wartime planners, and this mysterious figure (now an apparent eccentric sharing a desert trailer with a horde of cats) solves the mystery by telling all. (This happens all the time in thrillers - the hero doesn't so much solve the mystery as merely track down the person who does). Luckily, the authors mainatin their own shepticism even then, and there's a sense of mystery about whether the whole thing might be real or just a big hoax. Because neither Mssr.s Simpson or Burger claim to have unraveled the true secret of the Philadelphia Experiment (they only use it as a convenient and meaty plot device) they leave the biggest mystery unsolved - essentially, how such a thin story - completely uncorroborated by official sources and supported only by crackpots with the blessings of others with limitless powers of supposition - remains as heavily believed in til this day.	2001-08-10

(Though Grafton fans know the romance turns out okay, Coonts shows us how far from certain the romance was). As punishment for getting into a bar fight, Grafton is shipped to sea so he can tutor a new generation of aviators in flying the new generation of Intruder, the A-6E. Though he'd jump at the chance to fly the new plane, the fliers themselves are Marines - considered ham-handed apes not up to flying complex hardware. To add to the mix is Grafton's new commander, an ernest type hungry for action. With no airstrikes to keep them occupied, the new CAG spends his time planning attacks against soviet ships (Coonts makes the point that air-launched anti-ship missiles have not yet made it to American inventories, requiring planners and fliers to fall back on more reckless tactics). Is the new CAG in control or does he have an itchy trigger finger? And can Grafton get his cadets up to speed?<br />Unfortunately, while episodic takes that drive \\"Intruders\\" worked on \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", there isn't a central story to bring it together as that older book had. Planes crash, men die, carrier ops is just the most damgerous job in the world. Also, the green marines are cardboard characters who are not only less capable at flying then the characters of \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", but simply less interesting as well - like Razor, Boxman (who died in that older book), Cole and Cowboy (who lost his life years later in \\"Final Flight\\"). Even the postwar setting seems to work more against the novel then for it - there's no war to add to the dynamism of the situation. But at sea, there isn't any sense of the relief or shame or anything for the sacrifices of the war and its perceived results. Coonts wraps things up with an completely implausible tale involving a showdown with modern day pirates. This really kills the book which had started out as a return to the seeming homespun honesty (for a technothriller) of the first book - eschewing the villains, plots and schemes, and hidden agendas of Dale Brown, Clive Cussler and the latter Grafton books. Still closer to that spirit of the original \\"Flight\\" than Coonts' other books, and still well ahead of any competitors.e war and its perceived results.

In Bova's original &quot;Mars&quot;, the first human explorers escape the red planet after they had discovered life upon it - a mindless green lichen that hints at the possibilities of colonization.  The team's unofficial leader, native american Jamie Waterman made what promises to be a major discovery of his own - steps apparently cut into the side of a martian cliff.  Now returning on an expedition financed by a sinister billionaire with his own plans for Mars, Waterman looks to follow-up his last discovery.  Now the team leader (due to his experience on the other trip) Waterman commands a crew that will search for patterns among the martian lichen, further map mars and climb Olympus, the highest mountain in the solar system.  <br />Unable to walk the cliff-steps himself in &quot;Mars&quot;, Waterman waits years to return to Mars and make that ascent into the cliff wall and history.  In doing so, he stands not only to discover intelligent life but perhaps add substance to an ancient tribal legend that the dead red world and the blue on which they were born are actually brothers of a sort.  What lies at the top of the stairs adds tension to the story, one not spoiled when Waterman - pressure suit and all - takes that giant step.<br />Although Jamie's thoughts of the martians - which soon rise to the point of mystical visions - are evocative and would have made for a great novel, their dragged down by other elements brought in by Ben Bova, whether to shore up a better novel Bova thought beyond him, or simply to push some agenda.  Here, the greatest enemy is not some evil martian, or the natural dangers of an alien world, but Trumball, the expedition's bankroller, who threatens (gasp!!) to bring tourism to Mars (which is unlikely, since most on Earth can follow the expedition with their VR glasses and without subjecting themselves to the dangers of the trip) and spoil...whatever tourists spoil.  Bova pretty much downgrades all those back on Earth as uneducated boobswho don't know anything they don't see on VR.  He piously leads the fight against increased exploration to Mars, even though that would improve the chances of discovering more martian cities or other signs of their civilization.  Though Trumball is on Earth, his son fights for him on Mars, rivaling Waterman at every turn (including love, with Waterman's prospective conquests falling to the brat's boyish charm before they even reach Mars).  Dex Trumball, as a typical Bova charachter, gets little in the development treatment (his turnabout at the book's end isn't so much a charachter development as it is simply the author's changing his mind for him), and his early martian plans are an obvious clue that his mercenary plans for Mars are modeled on Cortes.  (Setting out for the landing sites of 1997's Martian Pathfinder, Trumball announces his intention to salvage it for the cash).  Realizing that the War against Tourism isn't enough for a story, Bova tosses in another element - the Coyote: the spirit of malice that will seek to undermine the mission and perhaps kill its members off.  In short, somebody on the team isn't what he seems.  Small accidents are followed by larger ones, clueing Waterman in that they've got a sabouteur on Mars.  But even this idea seems like filler, and the resolution is pretty pat for the tension that Bova wants to generate.  By the end of the book, the only enduring thing about it is the strikingly patronizing tone it saves for those back on their easy chairs on Earth - a tone reminescent of that used against religious-minded (but actually hypocritical) zealots in Bova's &quot;Moonrise&quot; series. Bova isn't so much concerned about discovering anything new on Mars as he is putting a wide moral chasm between his heroes and those who are simply greedy, ignorant or mindlessly zealous.  This could have been a much better book, but Bova's tortuous morality grounds it.	2001-07-22

Stephen Coonts, Grafton's creator, brews up a tale of crooked Russians, homocidal CIA agents and black market nukes being sold amid the disintegration of Russia.  Unfortunately, the story bogs down quickly when Grafton gets to Russia - mostly because the plot becomes overly complicated, but also due to the sheer implausibility that Coonts inserts into the story - like Grafton's single-handed destruction of a formation of highly agile Su-27 fighters while himslef flying only a hoggish Su-25; the novel's climax has the hero meet Saddam Hussein face-to-face and exact a measure of justice in an ending that seems incredibly pat for Coonts.  Even that ending would seem worse had it not capped off a book full of plot twists that don't come together.  Coonts' original &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot; was a great book because it resisted the temptation to become the sort of technothriller that &quot;Horseman&quot; is.

(Though carrying more ordinance than any other carrier-based airplane, none of the A-6's weaponry is for defense, and no sidewinders or cannon-shells ever arm the plane).  Though the communist north would be hurt by air strikes against its power stations, air fields and harbors, and despite America's capacity to simply erase the country from the map using nuclear weapons, Intruder pilots are sent to fly through heavily defended airspace to bomb probably non-existent targets like \\"suspected truck parks\\" and ammo dumps.  It's on one of these meaningless missions that Grafton's navigator is killed, and the novel begins with Jake confronting the futility of the war, especially in light of the politically imposed restrictions which put more meaningful targets firmly off limits to Yankee fliers.  Short a navigator, Grafton is paired with rotating fillers until being firmly hitched up to the mysterious \\"Tiger\\" Cole.  While Grafton is one of the Navy's best aviators (shipmates call him \\"Cool Hand\\"), Cole has amassed years of experience above him.  Between the two of them, their frustration mounts until they plan the inconceivable - an unauthorized bombing of the North's communist party HQ in Hanoi.  Resolving to keep the mission a secret, they both know that their discovery is inevitable and that they will have to answer for their actions.<br />\\"Intruders\\" is easily the greatest novel written about the air war over Vietnam, or anywhere.  Coonts creates highly fleshed characters like the laconic Cole, Camparelli, the dedicated CAG, \\"Razor\\", \\"Boxman\\" and of course, Grafton himself.  As a \\"technothriller\\" \\"Intruder\\" also excels not only on Coonts' thorough knowledge of the A-6 airplane but also his unique ability to work his knowledge into an excellent plot (and not the other way around as you'll see on just about any similar book).  What really sets this book apart from similar stories about the airwar is its brave treatment of the political realities of the war - though we've been prepped to despise the Byzantine regulation of the war, the ultimate court battle our heroes face isn'tr afraid to look at the issue from both sides.  Grafton's superiors, who'd be clueless buffoons in other books, are allowed to be dedicated and highly experienced officers here.  Grafton, on the other hand, is no hero, something Cool-Hand himself would be the first to admit to you.  Priceless dialog and a climax that is none-too-pat round out this novel.  Avoid the rip-offs (and the movie while you're at it).	2001-07-11

In Top Gun, the top pilots from fighter squadrons thruought the fleet come, not to compete against each other as depicted in the movie, but to learn from each other and to bring their new found expertise back to their units.  Rather than flying against each other (they do plenty of that while at sea) they spar against &quot;agressor units&quot; trained adversary pilots steeped in pseudo-communist bombast and flying old but mrderously agile and hard-to-spot jets like the A-4 Skywhak and the F-5 Tiger II.  (The F-16N, though slated to equip agressor units hadn't begun to enter service by the time the book was published.)  Victory against these agressors, despite the age of their aircraft, is impossible - at the outset.  But Top Gun is also about education, and the agressors work their charges well, until the tide of battle begins to turn, and the students begin besting their teachers. <br />More than just a picture book about Top Gun, Hall tells the story of air combat in general - tracing its roots in the flimsy planes and low-tech tactics of WWI to the failure of our all-missile interceptors in the Vietnam war, and the return of modern fighter pilots to the simple section and dogfight tactics of WWII.  Hall's pictures compliment the story - when telling of the F-14's disadvantes in terms of its mammoth size, he cuts to a shot of the plane flanked by much smaller Skyhawks, showing how the F-14's tailplane is wider than the Skyhawk's entire wingspan.  Describing the simplicity of the F-5 Tiger, the author shows a picture of its control panel, an austere set-up which looks barely sophisticated enough to fly a twin-engine Beech, let alone a mach-2 fighter.  When mentioning just how old the agressors' planes are (the Skyhawk was already old when flying missions in Vietnam) he shows one of the venerable jetssurrounded by its support team and looking less like an operational jet than an entrant at a Warbirds show.  Though not military trained - and making no bones about it - Hall goes a long way to putting the reader into the pilot's seat (actually the observer's seat, in Hall's case, but the g-forces are at least as powerful there).  The digital sophistication of the F-18 is ably contrasted with the brutish resistance of such earlier jets as the Phantom.  He also consistently underscores Top Gun's philosophy - never get caught with your guard down.  (In the low-level exercises, F-14 drivers can expect to meet such threats as helicopter gunships and close-support planes like the A-10, machines with no chance against a mach-2 fighter, unless able to trick its pilot into fighting according to their rules).  Through it all, he tosses out some great stories of air combat.  I bought this book back in 1987, when the movie and its hype was till fresh, and read it cover-to-cover countless times.  Today, the navy has changed - new planes and men; desert storm; political correctness; women flying combat aircraft; Top Gun has moved to remote Yuma, AZ from its probably more popular home in Miramar near San Diego; the MiG-29 and its generation of Russian jets was just becoming well known; the cold-war was still going on; and the Phantom - the plane that arguably started it all - is now a memory almost completely gone from Navy inventories.  Yet Hall's book is still fresh today, both as a time capsule for what has changed, and a reminder for how much remains the same in the world of air combat.	2001-07-04

In \\"Rules\\", Austin disobeyed official policy to shoot down a Vietnamese ace responsible for claiming numerous American airmen.  In \\"Targets\\", having escaped punishment for his actions in the previous book, Austin is now assigned a plum - if completely secret - assignment: fly a captured Russian jet into Vietnamese airspace, and shoot down every North Vietnamese aircraft he can find.  While some higher-ups would like to keep the purloined plane (a MiG-17) stateside for testing, a maverick flier insists on using the plane to sidle up to communist pilots and waste them.  Taught some Russian, given false papers, and some training in flying the none-too cooperative little jet, Austin sets out from a hidden jungle airbase near the DMZ, and proceeds to dig into the North's air force.  Expertise and the element of surprise do little against the superior numbers of the enemy, and, though free of his country's restrictive rules of engagement, he can't rely on help from them either.  Overwhelmed in the air, Austin finds his hidden airport under siege.<br />Because \\"Targets\\" is a more original story than \\"Rules\\" it's sadder that it's written just about as well.  Characters are pretty much cardboard, undeveloped and static.  Dialog is similarly one sided and flat.  The plot doesn't go far from the basic premise - just flying a highly secret mission and shooting down as many enemy jets as the hero can find.  There is no sense that author Joe Weber is working towards a bigger payoff, like a duel between Austin and an imported Soviet pilot who's no fool, or with an American pilot who simply doesn't realize who he's flying against.  The author also misses some golden moments of irony - like whether the danger of the mission is more preferable to the support he'd get flying as a regular pilot, with restrictive ROE and all, or simply the possibility that the mission may be some hidden form of punishment for Austin's misconduct in \\"Rules\\". Weber misses the most obvious twist of all - that a mission which assigns a pilot, at extreme risk, merely to go and kill as many of the enemy as possible - mirrors the futility of war. (Novels like \\"Rules\\" routinely criticize our leaders for their short-sighted decision-making in Vietnam, yet take a remarkably similar approach to the war in which most of the authors fought).  <br />The biggest dissappointment is the ersatz MiG itself, which would have been obsolete by the time it appeared in the era in which &quot;Targets&quot; is set.  The MiG-17 was no more than a highly modified version of the Korean-war era MiG-15, and it provides little excitement in terms of flight performance and sophistication.  It was probably the most advanced piece of Russian hardware the yankees could ahve gotten at the time, but, since the author has already suspended my belief with his poor writing, I would have been ready to accept a US-owned MiG-21 in a minute.<br />Unless you've read other novels about the Vietnam air war, you can start with this one.  Otherwise, you'll be severely underwhelmed.	2001-06-29
US	49374774	R37YC47SLTIB2V	0078816556	29970912	F-19 Stealth Air Combat	Books	4	0	0	N	N	(Fly) back to the future!!!	This is an important guide to playing Microprose's \\"F-19 Stealth Fighter\\".  In F-19 you fly the famous-fictitious airplane in missions for uncle Sam through the (unfriendly) world.  With a wide cache of smart weapons, and in theaters ranging from the Med, Southeast Asia, Northern Russia, Central Europe and the Persian Gulf, you are given a variety of missions involving targets either on the ground or airborne.  With high tech, the F-19's designers have cut the enemy's capacity to detect your wonder jet using thermal imaging and radar.  Now for the bad news - the F-19 handles like a pig, is slow, underpowered, leaden, and incapable of either snap-turns or sustained turns.  To stay stealthy, your weapons are stored internally and \\"delivered\\" through a bomb bay door (Slim Pickens not included) which cuts into your range and payload.  You can keep extra gas but that cuts further into payload.  The biggest ace in your enemies' hand is stealthiness itself - or rather its limits.  Stealth isn't an absolute - it merely offers less visibility than non-stealth planes, not complete invisibility.  By altering your shape relative to radar - whether changing your direction by climbing or turning - or simply opening up your bomb-bay door increases your RCS (Radar Cross Section) makes it easier for bad guys to spot you.  Also, you'll still have to fly at low altitudes where you have less maneuvering room against MiGs, are closer to ground-based guns, have more obstacles to maneuver around, and where the jet's behavior is at its worst.  (I'm not sure if the designers were able to model the so-called low altitude \\"ground effect\\" in 1989, but this sim seems pretty convinced that they were).  And, of course, you can be seen by the naked eye.<br />Though the F-19 makes for an unappealing airplane, it makes for a great sim - the limits of your jet's performance and invisibility forces you to perpetually watch your back, constantly challenging you to choose between confronting threats (he'll be close enough to see me!) or evading it (if I lob a Maverick at him, I'll wake up every radar site in North Africa!).  The sim even contains a suite of ELINT sensors that lets you know when you're approaching trouble by comparing the extent of your RCS against hostile radar signals both on the ground and in the air.  Microprose further adds to the meat by having you fly in a target rich and fairly detailed (for 1989) environment with locations and and a host of weapons, all of which will be immediately recognizable to anybody who's read \\"Red Storm Rising\\" or any of the Dale Brown novels.  (Flying over the Soviet's arctic naval Redoubt of Murmansk, and you'll catch exiting Typhoon-class missile subs, ala \\"Red October\\").  It's fun to read some of those techno-thrillers then come back and play the game.  On the down side, the sim shows its age with weak AI, unrealistic and flat terrain, and a weak mission structure - the missions are random, but not interconnected, which cuts down on the incentives to hit targets of opportunity (like the Soviet's mammoth Large Phased Array Radar complex near Pechenga).  A crude but atractive campaign builder that used semi-random missions (different locations and threats, but essentially the same mission in terms of overall goals) was used in Microprose's \\"Red Storm Rising\\" submarine simulation which came out at about the same time, and its absence here is annoying.  Still, the sim's comparative make it a must-play for archival purposes (and you thought \\"Jane's ATF\\" was old) at least.<br />This is a fun and useful guide to a groundbreaking simulation program (circa 1989!?!?) that occupies a sacred spot for any flight sim enthusiast old enough to have played the game when it first came out and represented the cutting edge not only in simulation technology but in concept.  While other sims of the era had you annihilating an entire military-industrial complex with a single F-16 (\\"Falcon\\", Spectrum Holobyte, 1987) or wiping out a Soviet Air Defense Regiment with but one F-15 (\\"F-15 Strike Eagle\\", Microprose, 1986),  F-19 took an entirely different path - that of remaining hidden, sneaking into some moderately defended enemy territory (like Libya) or some not-so moderately defended territory (the huge Soviet Naval complex of the Kola Peninsula) like a thief.  The guide has many useful strategies but is best for fleshing out a sim that set the standard for those based on planes that actually were built.	2001-06-26

Meanwhile, the ships comprising the task force begin breaking down, while the men who run them seem pre-broken-down themselves.  When a PLO splinter group uses ethnic unrest on Cyprus to seize a group of Americans as hostages, teh stage is set for disaster.  As a further omen of disaster, one of the Task Force's officers is named Dan Lenson, a USN Lieutenant who seems to bring trouble wherever he goes both here and in other books by DC Poyer.  While news of the hostage situatiuon, which shifts from Cyprus to an abandoned resort inside Syria, comes soon, that Lenson's wife is one of the hostages is Lenson's wife, remains deliberately suppressed.  <br />Though looking like a techno-thriller, &quot;The Med&quot; as Poyer fans have come to expect, is more of a charachter-driven novel set in a Navy unit.  Here, the major players are Lenson, his wife (struggling, confornting, ala Stokholm, her feelings for her captors), Sundstrom, Lenson's unpopular commander (who thinks everybody is setting him up for disaster, and is paralyzed by indecision), Givens, and African-American marine terrorized by his more militant corporal, Wronowicz, the career engineer of a Navy destroyer, and Harisah, the so-called &quot;Majd&quot; who commands the terrorists.  As in &quot;The Gulf&quot;, these charachters don't always intersect (the UDT divers who remain apart from the focus of Lenson thruought much of that book), but that only clues one into how expansive the subject is.  The non-charachter driven parts of the book are refreshingly anti-techno (mostly Wronowicz's epic efforts to change a propellor-shaft bearing while his destroyer is at sea).  While a feel for nautical-mechanics of the nuts-and-bolts of amphibious warfare help for an understanding of what's going on, the effects of thsoe efforts in sheer exhaustion are easily visualized.  The book climaxes in a seemingly doomed rescue-attempt (though the assault-force has the best chances of getting to the hostages, a rescue attempt seems a more apt job for some special forcers team).  The action seems underwhelming, and it's hard to understand what's going on sometimes, though this is probably because Poyer is writing outside of his element.  By the end of the book, we know it's not exactly a happy-ending, but things seem way-too pat.  Still, the writing and the charachter formations are what drive Poyer books and help them surpass techno-thrillers.	2001-06-24

Planning on sailing into California, they and their British cover confront the Russian navy and some of its local allies (including the Argentines who aren&#8217;t so much pro-Soviet as anti-British).  The novel closes on what is supposed to be an epic sea-battle between nuclear subs both western and Red, but none of it will grab anybody whose read the more famous books on sub-warfare like &#8220;Red October&#8221; or &#8220;Sink the Potemkin&#8221;.  The loyal Russians seem more than typically cardboard (with the dreaded political officers exhibiting greater than usual incompetence and blind loyalty) and make numerous gaffes.  The heroes get to gloat and a happy end is guaranteed.  The Russian hardware, to match their users&#8217; sloppiness, seems notably unreliable and poorly designed, though this seems to simplify explaining how the heroes triumph over numerically superior Russians as well as giving the author a license to display his command over many technical details which otheriwse don&#8217;t advance the plot or make the book a real page turner.

Fearful of Gamel Abdel Nasser's pan-Arabism and his popularity in the west where Isreal had come to expect it would enjoy support, Israel mobilized a small guerrila force of young and mostly Egyptian Jews (in an ironic hint to the Exodus, Egyptian Jews were called &quot;Hawagat&quot;, signifying that they were less Egyptian citizens then residential aliens) to execute small attacks around that country, less to destroy it than merely make it look less orderly than Nasser could claim.  Under circumstances that remain shrouded in mystery to this day, the conspiracy fell apart and the usual suspects were soon rounded up, tortured and imprisoned in brutal Egyptian jails.  When the Egyptians published their findings to the world, the feedback wreaked havoc in Israel, bringing down the government and destroying long constructed public careers.  For those not executed by the Egyptians (once their ties were firmly linked to Israel and not merely some super-patriotic gang of Egyptians leery of any contact with the west) the ordeal only began with their convictions around 1954.  Though Israel captured hundreds of Egyptians in her wars of 1956 and the Six Day War of 1967 (including the military officer who presided over the trial), the surviving members of the operation (in this book, the term used is &quot;the mishap&quot;) remained incarcerated through early 1968.  Even still, a gag order prevented them from telling their story until the mid 1970's, by which time, they still had more questions than answers.  Mostly - why was there no warning that they had been compromised?;  why had no escape route been prepared?; and most heartbreaking of all - why were they left to rot when Israel held hundreds of Egyptian POWs in the Sinai campaigns of '56 and '67?<br />Author Aviezer Golan seeks no answers, rather tries telling an absorbing story that only begins with the mishap's participants entrance into 14 years of incarceration.  The book is actually most poignant when looking inside the Egyptian prisons.  If De Tocqueville was right about analyzing a nation through its jails, then those in Egypt have a strange story to tell.  Though jailed with many petty criminals and murderers, the Mishap's conspirators also meet political prisoners - both far-right Islamists of &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; and various leftists who had run afoul of the Nasser regime in its many political shifts.  Prison conditions, like politics make strange allies and leftist Egyptians who befriended the imprisoned Jews at first, turned against them when politics shifted in their direction.  The hardcore Islamists, though taught to abhor the Jews as a matter of eternal religion, forge a more durable bond with the Jews, admittedly not one that can be expected to change things outside of prisons.  All in all, &quot;Operation Susanah&quot; isn't a story you'll forget.	2001-05-20

When war came shortly after the Wright brothers' first flight, it didn't take long for militaries to recognize the uses (though not imediately offensive) of the airplane.  This book goes back to those early, clumsy beginnings, tracing the history of dogfighting from the Red Baron until Desert Storm, with stops in Britain (as in &quot;Battle of&quot;), Korea and Vietnam.  This is more of a coffee table book, and few aviation buffs will find anything that new.  An historical survey of fighter aircraft is a bit ambitious for a single book, even as slim as this one.  But the pictures are excellent, and the reading, if light, is engaging.  The author also remains close to the humans who drive these killer machines - from brooding Frank Luke and the cold-blooded Richtoven to the WWII aces turned jet-age wing commanders like Robin Olds.  The author wisely breaks down the periods rather than consolidate them, and also has separate chapters for each nation.  It's in WWI chapters that the author shines - his tales of the early aces give those pioneer warriors the attention that usually goes to pilots of Mustangs, Sabrejets and Fulcrums.  The technology was barely existent to get planes in the air, let alone coordinate them (no radar or wireless radio was available; even in the next war, Russian pilots preferred their slow and unmaneauverable lend-lease P-39 fighters over faster and more agile Yaks, because the American planes came with radio), and even tactics weren't rigidly enforced (German ace Boelke warned his sqaudronmates against letting more than one plane attack an enemy, since in the fray, the two wingmen might collide - a fear that turned true when Boelke collided with a fellow Albatross while he and the wingmen concentrated on a single enemy plane).  Even when air superiority was achieved, the weak technology of the age gave this little meaning - the British had air superiority overthe Somme, yet still lost in one day more men than America lost in a decade in Vietnam.  Unfortunately, the story thins out after WWI, and the author feels comfortable enough to rely on the same material aviation fans have seen in countless forgettable discovery-channel documentaries.  Although the pictures are great, the author runs out of stories to in them to.  Nevertheless, the pictures are still enough reason for your resident flyin fool to appreciate.	2001-05-04

When the three find the horribly crow-ravaged body at the controls of the wreck, their first impulse is to call the local police of their rural town.  Then they find the flier's cargo, a duffle bag bursting with hundred dollar bills, and they realize a chance that will kill them unless taken.  The narrator and his brother Jacob are safe after a youth of uncertainty - their parents were killed in a freak accident that left the two indebted orphans.  While the narrator seems to have adjusted to his comfortable, if nondescript life, his brother is a scarred shell, a delayed boy in a sad sack's body.  Then there's Sarah, the narrator's prgenant wife who soon becomes the brains of the operation.  The crew works slowly and carefully, taking small actions meant to preserve the veil they've woven, only to compound the risk of their discovery.  Every move to further hide themselves and their money leads to further complications, driving them to even more desperate measures until their plans have become too costly to reverse.  By the end of the book, we've seen an incredible metamorphosis of the narrator, not into an evil man - he's always the same simple guy, only he's discovered in himslef an incredible reservoir of willingness to perpetrate evil to protect what the money he didn't even want.  It's an evil not the product of greed but by the narrator's being too simple to say &quot;no&quot;.  Magically being able to reach Stephen King heights of horor without relying on the supernatural as a metaphor for very real inner demons, and with beautifully unpretentious prose, Scott Smith's first novel is perfect.  He is never judgmental about his charachters, yet remains honest about them.  Be forewarned, Smith wields irony over his rural charachters like a scythe.  Comparisons to the film &quot;Fargo&quot; are inevitable, but you won't find any little funny guy here.	2001-04-30

Until now, NUMA has been the home-base of adventurer Dirk Pitt, the legendary creation of real-life submarine archaeologist Clive Cussler.  Author Paul Kaprecos tries to carry the franchise a little further by adding new heroes to NUMA's roster - Austin and Zavala, but the result is a pale rip-off of a formula that was getting old when handled by Cussler.  In this story, as with many of the Pitt-novels, a modern day crisis has roots or some other connection to an age-old mystery.  Here, a Mayan artifact, shipped across the Atlantic on the Andrea Doria, goes down when that ship collides with a Swedish luxury liner.  Fast-forward a few decades later: an archeological expedition in North Africa is brutally massacred, leaving only one survivor, a supermodel-esque archeologist who barely escapes death when managing to reach a nearby NUMA research ship.  Helping out, and then having to confront the assassins themselves on a follow-up raid, Austin and Zavala pick up the pieces and discover a shadowy cabal that stretches from the age of Christopher Columbus to a shadowy southwest American businessman named Halcon.  When the trail leads to a ring that smuggles mayan relics out of South America, Zavala and Austin uncover further proof that America's first &quot;discoverers&quot; had crossed the Atlantic ages earlier than Columbus.  Through it all, a band of assassins linked to Halcon follows NUMA, indicating that even these age-old relics are important.  With its offbeat NUMA charachters (like the obese St. Julien Perlmutter), the heroes put together an impressive theory to account for the presence of non-Mayan relics in Mayan temples, clues that signal an even bigger pay-off down the line.<br />What kills the book is how thin a story it is, one that will be familiar to anybody who's read the other Cussler novels.  The evil Halcon is in turns no more greedy, magalomaniacal and insane than the baddies faced by Dirk Pitt, so his master plan, when revealed, won't exactly come as a surprise.  The mystery itself doesn't seem to offer that much appeal.  Searching for buries treasure is less NUMA than &quot;Little Rascals&quot; - as say an exotic metal that will power an anti-missile defense (&quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;), a missing nuclear submarine (&quot;Pacific Vortex&quot;), the dommsday bug bacteria (&quot;Vixen&quot;) or a treaty that gives Canada to the United States (&quot;Night Probe&quot;).  Also, Cussler was better when he put his pieces together - usually a round-up session when the major charachters gather togather and tell what they know, only to have Dirk Pitt put the pieces together in a way that nobody expected.  In &quot;Serpent&quot;, the mystery involves a &quot;talking stone&quot; whose meaning escaped the Spanish exploerers.  Somehow, the rock never becomes more than a mere slab in these pages.  The new NUMA novels had an interesting idea - replacing the lone hero with some teamwork and camaraderie.  Only, the payoff would have been a more expansive story.  Instead, the charachters never become more than fragments of Dirk Pitt, accomplishing together what Pitt would have pulled off alone.  Instead, opt for one of Cussler's own Pitt novels.	2001-04-22

For those who didn't know, there really is a &quot;Five Towns&quot; which straddles the lines of affluence (Hewlett is pretty much at the top, with Lawrence stretching too closely to Far Rockaway for its Waspy residents' liking; Woodmere seems to be a hothouse of cheap housing for 1950's Jews fleeing the boroughs; Cedarhurst is the commercial area while Inwood is the blue collar buffer between the wealthier neighborhoods and the industrial sprawl surrounding Far Rockaway and JFK Airport).  Unfortunately, the novel is pretty thin stuff, even for Five Towners.  Once you've gotten past seeing your street appear in some chapters, you're left with a thin story about a young Jewish girl whose comfortable illusions of her family is shattered both by the turbulence of the postwar years, the simmering dislike that the Towns' Wasp residents harbor against the incoming Jews and her mother's possible infidelity.  In other words, this is the same story rehashed in historical novels beyond numbers.  (I've got my own axe to grind against such books which aren't inspired enough to qualify as novels nor critical enough to deserve be called &quot;historical&quot;).<br />Having grown up in the &quot;Five Towns&quot;, I'm still not sure why they have become the model for upwardly mobile post-war Jewish communities.  My guess is that somebody needed to create a stereotype of such a neighborhood and, too tired to really work it up, just grabbed the first neighborhood that came to mind.  The real Five Towns are famous if only because people seem to know about them.	2001-04-16

On a lark, and having found a copy that I bought but never read, I packed this novelization of the 1981 film for a vacation.  In the film, Peter Mcnichol plays a sorcerer's apprentice who fights against a dragon when his mentor dies.  &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; is actually the story of a battle between two evils - both the dragon and a corrupt king who holds lotteries to choose who will be sacrificed to the dragon to placate it.  The novel adds many elements, but doesn't do much with them.  The place is Urland, an ancient British kingdom in England about the time of St. Patrick, with the ancient ways of magic and similar superstitions giving way to a new existence basd on the cross.  Few take the Christians that seriously and look for salvation to the magicians when Vermithrax, the evil dragon, takes up residence in Urland's heartland.  The author seems to want to draw a picture of what life was like in those days as a new faith swept Europe and the Roman occupation remained very real in the people's minds.  He even draws a better picture of the relationship between the Dragon and the magicians without having to explain it so succintly that there's no mystery.  unfortunately, he doesn't get that far before he goes back to battle with the dragon.  He also misses one important plot element - the Dragon itself.  With the world at a crossroad between the lore of magic and the faith of the cross, the dragon has a meaning that also changes.  To Galen, the young magician, the Dragon is the last of his kind, a bitter old monster intent on making life miserable for whoever it sees.  For the Christains, the Dragon is not a stubborn remnant of a dying age, but the devil itself, intent on aborting a nascent religion.  Though Galen and magic is the hero, it's the christian viewpoint that seems more compelling.  This book is the one that teaches that Vermithrax means &quot;Worm of Thrace&quot;.	2001-04-12

The tragic story of the Whaler &quot;Essex&quot; supposedly inspired Mellville to Pen &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, though I'd suspect that the tales of the crew of Essex only rose above a well founded lore of a precarious trade.  In &quot;Heart&quot;, we are told not only of the Essex, but also of the contemporary whaling industry.  Centered in Northeast America, about as far from the whaling waters of the Pacific as you can get, the Whalers would sail around Tiera Del Fuego in South America in search of their prey.  But author Philbrick also shows us the people, the staunchly pious Quakers who financed the trade and, holding with their abolitionist views, crewed their ships with emancipated slaves.  The insecurities of the pious would be a great explanation for why whalers ported so far from their hunting grounds, although the lack of any comparable industrial base in contemporary California (and the inability to transfer there) would be a more practical explanation.  Philbrick doesn't really explore that issue.  Instead, he shows us the crew of the Essex on the hunt and then, in a sudden reversal, tossed to the sea when a rogue sperm whale rams their ship and sinks it.  Not quite the prey, the Essex's crew are now helpless in the middle of an ocean from which they plundered.  The sea knows no heroes, but it recognizes acts of cruelty, and even the crews' morality of equality (which will play a role when the nation goes to war against itself 40 years down the line) seems to go down with the ship when the specter of cannibalism arises.  Incredibly, this tale - whose ending is ofcourse a foregone conclusion - is an incredible page turner.	2001-04-02

The flying life of WWII fighter pilot Greg Boyington, who flew against the Japanese with the Flying Tigers immeidately prior to to WWII and then again with the Marines until being shotdown in 1944 and becoming a POW.  Greg &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington's career as a Marine aviator was pretty much over before America even entered WWII.  At that point, teh fighting was being carried on, supposedly, by the Europeans and the Chinese. When numerous pilots were being asked to join the famous &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; - a Chinese AF unit actually run by Americans and flying American fighters - Boyington jumoed at the chance.  With his career going nowhere, and his marriage also over, the prospect of going to China to fly against the Chinese offered him a chance of redemption, to put his career on hold until he could get back from China with a record strong enough to rejuvinate his career.  Instead, frequent clashes with the head of the Tigers - Claire Chennault - led to Boyington's quick removal from that unit.  Leaving China, where condescending Yankees are sewing the seeds of hostility which the Chinese will harvest in 1949, Boyington finds he can't get back to flight duty.  The Marines, from which Boyington resigned in order to join the Tigers, at first can find no record of Boyington's arrangement to rejoin the Marines at Major's rank.  Despite this, and also despite Chennault's insistence to Boyington's superiors that Boyington be reinstated to the Marines and given a desk job, Boyington returns to the Pacific in time to fly F-4U Corsairs against the Japanese for the Marines.  Patching together a squadron out of misfit flyers, Boyington leads his men against the Japanese in a theater that isn't getting the most attention from Washington.  Everything seems second hand about Boyington's unit, already deemed unusable by others.  This was especially true of their planes.  Though the Corsair was powerful, it had racked up a poor saftey record among Navy carrier units unusedto it.  Nicknames like &quot;Widowmaker&quot;, &quot;Bent-Wing Eliminator&quot; and &quot;Whispering Death&quot; hint at a lethality directed at Corsair pilots almost as much as at the Japanese.<br />Shotdown by the end of 1944, Boyington endures nightmarish deprivation as a POW.  Nevertheless, there isn't a bitter bone against the Japanese to be found anywhere.<br />Returning to America with the war's end, Boyington slides deeper into alcholism and failure.  The most enduring image for me is that of the scarred warrior as a ref in wrestling matches, a long way from the glory he should have realized from his iron determination in the air.  Boyington's honesty seems striking - he reserves virtually all of the blame for himself.  &quot;Show me a hero&quot;, he says &quot;and I'll show you a bum.&quot;	2001-03-26

We were wrong - as the first few pages of &quot;Minotaur&quot; make clear.  The Minotaur is the codename for a Russian spy blamed for leaking sensitive military secrets to the Russians.  Many think the spy a myth, but Jake Grafton - now permanently grounded and assigned a desk in the Pentagon - has to consider the mole real enough.  Given control over the Navy's new stealth bomber program, Grafton confronts mysterious accidents and the mysterious death of his predecessor.  He must also confront the program's more mundane obstacles - like the fact that it's impossible to design a truly effective stealth plane, and that the most promising design will be edged by the more politically attractive one.  While most writers would wax eloquently on the virtues of their techno toys, Coonts looks at the advanced technology aircraft in his book dispassionately.  Stealth aircraft, Coonts warns us, are underarmed, not very maneuverable, and very short-ranged.  The USAF's stealth fighter, for its whiz-bangs, is essentially a Navy A-7 that (for the moment) can evade any radar in the world and drop a total of two bombs, both being the sort of high-tech toys that never work.  (This book came out before Desert Storm).  Combining the rigors of the program with an espionage story is pretty daring, and Coonts tries some nifty tricks.  Unfortunately, though a promising idea, to many charachters really are dual charachters with assumed identities - neither of which are defined before being revealed to be other ill-drawn charachters.  There are too many secret agendas and cross-plots, though Coont's writing encourages re-reading.  The charachters that aren't mysterious - &quot;Toad&quot; Tarkington, Rita Morovia and Grafton himself remain pretty crisp, though we haven't any of the great charachters from the first &quot;Intruder&quot;.  Still a worthy read and among Coonts' best.	2001-03-20
US	49374774	R2VZK44HG76DL6	0891415998	318348920	Phantom Over Vietnam: Fighter Pilot, USMC	Books	4	16	16	N	N	Uncommon fighter pilot's memoir	I read &quot;Phantom Over Vietnam&quot;, the memoir of a Marine fighter pilot, before plunging into the mounds of similar books on the subject of the Vietnam Air War, both novel and memoir. Thus I couldn't appreciate how the book was unique.  Most authors on the subject generalize the air war - the technology and tactics - while highlighting the overt civilian control of a war being fought based on political rather than military goals.  While Trotti raises those issues, he never turns his book into an indictment on the Johnson administration, Rob McNamara's Defense Department &quot;whiz-kids&quot;, or the liberals who others have blamed for undermining the war effort - concluding that the war was futile.  The book follows Trotti from his arrival in Vietnam in the war's early and heady days, then notes the apparent changes when the optimism fades.  After an interval spent training newer aviators stateside, Trotti returns for more.  His descriptions of the flights are weighthed down by detail on such topics as the F-4 Phantom's mechanics, aero-navigation and airborne communications protocol (which is also a mystery to the author).  But these burdens are probably intentional - Trotti isn't going for action.  He does nothing to make himslef look heroic - what can you say about a guy who admits that his biggest fear isn't of missiles or MiG fighters, but of the power seats in his airplane (the author is not a tall man).  One interesting aspect - unlike the cool and pristine airplanes in similar books, Trotti's jets are aged (and prematurely so) by the rigors of combat and flight.  The most enduring images of the book, are those of a newly shipped F-4, with its fresh paint job, sharing ramp space with older jets with their paint blistered by supersonic air.  It's not a book you'll read in one sitting, but it's not a book you'll read only once.	2001-03-07

While two-man aircews should be enough to generate the structure around which can be built a great aviation novel (like &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;), it's wasted here as we watch the two engage in the sort of antics popularized in Top Gun while the top brass watches powerless, and aged admirals watch wishing they could be young nuggets again.  Much of the novel is episodic, and not written very well, following the boys as their aircraft carrier charts the expected hostile waters, but we never feel as is we are actually there.  The airplanes aren't fully realized, nor are the struggles of becoming a proficient aviator made out well enough to describe the charachters and why their superiors tolerate them.  Ditch this book for anything else by Coonts.	2001-03-05
US	49374774	R3VX5RAMRU4FAE	0671574175	254545554	Tom Clancy's SSN (Win95 CD-ROM)	Books	3	9	9	N	N	Expected more from Clancy	In &quot;SSN&quot;, you are the commander of the USS Cheyenne, one of the latest ships of US Navy's vaunted Los Angeles Class submarines, fighting your sub against the might of the Chinese navy in a war in the South China Sea.  A coup by Chinese Generals, detailed by extensive FMV scenes, puts the PRC on a warpath with the West.<br />The missions however are a major botch, which is sad becauise of the work that went into them and the potential for something better.  Instead of controlling your sub from the inside - plotting your course over a mving map, searching for targets on the sonar screen or periscope, giving orders to various crewmembers - you now drive your sub from the outside, with the main view being that of the Cheyenne coasting along the undersea mountains and running across the occasional whale and (the not-so-occassional) Chinese sub.  (Visually spotting the subs isn't a cheat - they don't become visible until Sonar detects them).  Handling of the sub seems pretty realistic - you now control the ballast controls, and the sub sinks during prolonged turns.  The undersea setting is also pretty abosorbing, full of ambient sound from enemy ships and marine biology - including whales and seagulls.  Isothermals - invisible lines created by rapid changes in water temperature - appear as thin layers of dust.  Changes in distance from an object cause doppler shifts in the sound that object emits - most radically for torpedoes which are about the fastest objects you'll encounter (underwater, anyway).  <br />What kills the realism is the game's biggest novelty - the &quot;spot&quot; view for the Cheyenne is of limited use.  Unfortunately, it's always on, and can't be cycled with something more useful, like a threat indicator, or atleast snipped so that it allows more room for a target computer that tracks more than one target.  The sonar screen remains as a small circle lacking even a map overlay so you can at least mentally mark off where sonar targets were whenthey dissappear (as they will).  It's as if the game's writers hit off on this great idea and then realizing how unimportant it was, decided they couldn't get rid of it.  With the sub always on screen, it's hard to past the idea that we're outside of a six-inch model of a sub, rather than directing a major undersea battle inside of it.  <br />Considering that this is Tom Clancy, there are also some realism issues - the South China sea scenario isn't unrealistic, but playing the game against Chinese in mostly Russian hardware, the question arises - why not just set the game in the Barent's sea and rename the game &quot;Red Storm Rising for Win95&quot;?  The answer is that the game was needed to hype a book which - to remain as cutting edge as everything Clancy does - had to include a speculative conflict against China.  The newer scenario never gels, though, without icepacks.  More problematic are the Chinese subs - a mix of Russian imports and Chinese &quot;Han&quot; nuclear subs.  The Russian subs break down into diesel boats like the Kilo, but also nuclear subs like the Alfa and the Akula, niether of which exist in the numbers represented here.  (Only six Alfas ever entered service, most if not all sunk between the various Clancy novels).  A more realistic story would have had the fighting covered by Victor II and Victor III subs, with the others in smaller numbers.  Also, there aren't any rocket-torpedoes like the Sea Lance, or medium range cruise missiles like Sub-Harpoon.  The Clancy's Chinese seems utterly bereft of any cruise-missile subs, and never form any cohesive teamwork.  Also, the most important subs in the game are also the easiest to detect - in latter missions, the Typhoon class and Severodvinsk Class subs just suddenly appear in front of you when they should be the hardest to detect.<br />Overlooking these flaws, &quot;SSN&quot; has limited playability - the missions are pre-scripted, and are played in clusters which must be completed before proceeding to the next cluster.  This is annoying when you've got a four-mission cluster consisting of two uneventful missions followed by a murderously impossible third mission that endlessly sends you back to square-1.  Nearing the end of the game, assuming you've got the patience, you're probably asking yourself how much hard-drive you'll be reclaiming.<br />SSN fills a niche between arcade games and hardcore sub sims like Janes 688i.  I ran the game on a P166 (then) lacking an accelerator card, and the graphics and sound were flawless.	2001-03-05

Unfortunately, it's also the first one I ever read. Pitt, a diver for the National Underwater and Marine Agency seems like just your average technical guy. But NUMA, whose aims of oceanic reasearch somehow allow the agency to function like an espionage agency (with the gadgets to boot) normally send Mr. Pitt on any sort of wild adventure. And Mr. Pitt himself is the perfect renaissance spy, an expert on history, underwater diving, any form of mortal combat, and the collection and restoration of antique boats, cars and planes, and a real charmer with the ladies. Perhaps no seris of books so closely approaches the fun level of a comic book while remaining so readible as a novel. In this entry, numerous diverse plot twists come together for an explosive climax. As with any Pitt novel, the story opens with some historical maritime disaster/mystery: In this case, it is the dissappearance of the Collier &quot;Cyclops&quot; early this century to the Bermuda Triange. In modern days, a wealthy industrialist takes off in a restored blimp for a tropical flight, only to dissappear. While the blimp is found sometime later, the tycoon is found to have been replaced with the bodies of some unidentified men who look like they've been floating for weeksin a depressurized space capsule. Meanwhile, a super-secret US base located on the moon (not even the President knows of it) faces discovery by belligerent Russians. Meanwhile, Dirk Pitt pieces clues pointing to &quot;La Dorada&quot; (which should have been a better title), a huge golden statue encrusted with jewels. Meanwhile, the Russians, unable to afford its &quot;alliance&quot; with Cuba, nor willing to allow Cuba to go over to the west, plots a blow that will put the Island off limits for good. <br />It's explosive, comical at times, yet always exciting and impossibel to put down. Put this one on your &quot;beach reading&quot; list.	2001-02-27

In this case, it's the &quot;Dreamstar&quot;, an airplane so maneuverable, it has to be guided by thought impulses.  With it's forward-swept wings, it can outfly any other plane.  It's only remote competition is a specially modified F-15, the Cheetah, flown by Brown's hero, Pat Mclanahan.  Unfortunately, Dreamstar's pilot is actually a deep-plant Russian agent who's not only not above selling out the US, but completely pathological as well.  Faced with the prospect of losing his chance to fly the airplane, the mole steals it, touching off a chain of fierce dogfighting and much superpower bickering.  <br />The Russians are perfectly craven, but the really annoying charachters are the heroes - teh kind of stalwart guys who know they're in teh right and won't let some stupid bureaucrat or politician get in the way.  Almost as bad are the liberals - those who advise the president to wait and see, the kind we're supposed to hate more than the Russians.  But the worst of all is the evil Russian spy, another one of Brown's demented villains.  An indecisive, or simply inept or insecure villain could have made the whole thing perfectly plausible, and even added some fun to the mix.  Instead, it comes off as a cheat (because the unbalanced bad-guy acts without reason, he doesn't require much in the way of charachter development, and also because it keeps the Russians from taking the sort of action that would have given them the plane before the book was half-way complete).<br />We're supposed to overlook these flaws because &quot;Cheetah&quot; is supposed to be realistic, and I'll ahve to wait until some F-15 driver says &quot;that's the way it is&quot;.  Brown gives his charachters extensive dialog, even when they're supposed to be strapped into jet fighters screaming 50 feet over a the floor of a valley, or trying to evade hostil radar - as if it's no big deal.  Brown stages hisdogfights from a detached perspective - we know where every fighter is at every time (as opposed to the real world, where that kind of situational awareness is extremely rare).  I remember having more fun with my flight sim games - and that was in 1993!!  Much better was &quot;Firefox&quot;, also about a thought-controlled superfighter getting hijacked.	2001-02-16

Certain that the Russians have already kidnapped Sea Leopard's inventor, and compromised its technology, the Royal Navy rushes a prototype to sea aboard the submarine &quot;Proteus&quot;.  The joke's on the Brits - Leopard's inventor is only in imminent danger of kidnap, and the Red Navy resorts to an outrageous course of piracy to grab a hold of Leopard's technology by grabbing the Proteus.<br />&quot;Sea Leopard&quot; tries your credibility sometimes, but it's otherwise perfect Craig Thomas - the Russians, the Arctic, thos fast paced, unsentimental prose.

They cram a lot of information - most entries for countries are in abstract form, with some countries getting maps, and the largest and most important air arms getting detailed organizational charts.  The aircraft digests concentrate on the chief variant of any given aircraft with added information on the less well known.  The pictures are a mixed bag.<br />A word about how dated this book is - when published, the MiG-29 existed - as far as we knew - only on &quot;official&quot; DoD sketches that look like they were written by 3rd graders.  The Su-27 was virtually unknown.  At the same time, the air arms considered such eventually dead-end products as the Mirage 4000, the Lavi and the Chinese &quot;Super-7&quot;, and these vaporous machines get equal billing.  In all fairness, I'm using hindsight, and that shouldn't detract from this book which is a great time capsule of world air forces, not only as they existed in the Reagan years, but also as they were envisioned.	2001-02-13

We know we're not getting the whole story, but the author has enough to satisfy.  From stolen (actually borrowed) Russian jets and unmanned space probes, to our own unmanned D-21 Mach-3 spyjets, the authors go for it all.  Some of the information is pretty suprising (the mysterious Col. Tomb, thought killed in the now legendary Vietnam airwar dogfight with Driscoll and Cunningham, may have been misidentified) while other stories seem tedious (like the use of Hound-Dog cruise missiles as first generation remote spyplanes).  I would have preferred the authors concentrate on the really mysterious jets (I get the sense that the authors felt they owed each story equal time), but what comes out is an eye-opener nontheless.	2001-02-13

With the end of the cold war, USAF brought together the once separate Strategic Air Command with the fighters and support planes of Tactical Air Command, creating a new Air Combat Command with a flexible range of assets in terms of equipment and manpower.  New units now include both bombers like the B-1b and F-111 as well as fighters like the F-16.  Clancy goes further than that, also surveying the essential technologies of military aviation (vectored-thrust, low-bypass engines; radar absorbsent material; reduced radar cross-section; smartbombs; etc..) from the basics to the cutting edge.  While anybody could have put this package togther, I doubt that they could have done as good a job as Clancy who never loses touch with the fact that he's not a fighter pilot or even any military material himself, and always knwos just how to get across to the reader.  It's sort of like a textbook you don't mind reading.  The survey concludes in a hypothetical airwar set in (or over) Viet Nam.  (Guess who wins...)	2001-02-13

Poor Mitchell Gant, the burnt-out Vietnam vet and ex-fighter jock dragooned by &quot;The Company&quot; to sneak into Russia and steal the latest Soviet wonder fighter plane, &quot;Firefox&quot;.  Having barely survived storms of Russian missiles and a close dogfight with the other Firefox prototype, he discovers (in the first few pages of &quot;Firefox Down&quot;) that he's running out of fuel.  Mustering all of his flying skills, and after another un-in with other Russian jets, Gant lands on a frozen lake in Finnish Lapland, outside of Russia - but not far enough.  Barely getting out of the empty Russian jet before it sinks under a frozen lake, Gant is captured by the Russians.  The western spymasters, too late to save Gant, quickly locate the Firefox, but are cut off by a blizzard.  Thus starts the race  - for the west to break out of the storm before the Russians learn the superplane's location.<br />Few sequels measure up to their original, fewer ofcourse succeed, but &quot;Down&quot; is atleast the match of the first book.  Picking up exactly where the last let off, Thomas displays his masterful sense of precisely paced action, riveting aerial scenes and nuanced charachters.  Not as personal a novel as &quot;Firefox&quot;, which was more centered around pilot/pirate Mitchell Gant, &quot;Down&quot; is more of an ensemble piece with more charachters in the trenches.  Still, Gant, seemingly played out in the last book, continues to reveal more scars, unpeeling himself like an onion.  This isn't your typical paper-thin technothriller, but you knew that already if you read &quot;Firefox&quot;.	2001-02-09

For those who know their military hardware, &quot;Kilo&quot; refers to a class of Russian built electric-powered (non-nuclear) submarines.  Though shorter-ranged than nuclear subs which can remain submerged for months, the electric-drive is inherently quieter than nuclear power (which relies on pumps and piping), making boats like the kilo harder to detect, and thus deadlier.  Add late 1980's technology to increase efficiency, throw in some deep-pockets clients from the sunnier (and less-stable) regions of the globe (where they watch C-span with a laugh-track) and the kilo becomes the cheap answer to submarine warfare - fast, deadly and impossible to find.<br />Strangely, the plot of &quot;Kilo Option&quot; similarly escapes detection, but that doesn't help things.  Instead, &quot;Option&quot;, in which charachters load up on plots and counterplots, goes beyond incomprehensible.  Describing what the book is about is impossible, though it's safer to say what's in the book - Saddam Hussein plotting; fanatical Iranian mullahs; rogue Russians selling their hardware and services to the highest bidder; lots of shooting; lots of hardware; a hunky hero who never manages to get the bad guy (it's hard yto like a hero who fails to bring an end to this interminable book); and a Russian agent whose less a charachter than an engine of doom with dialog (even Darth Maul had funnier lines than this guy).  with the plot so murky, there's never any sense that Flannery is working up to a climax, as if he can sustain a climax from an early shootfest thruought the length of his book.  Thus, we only have a dwindling number of pages to mark the passage of the book (and even that can't always convince).  <br />The weirdest thing about this book is the way it parallels the nonesensical &quot;Crossfire&quot; written by David Hagberg - Flannery's alter-ego.  Throwing in some stuff about subs (sunken U-boats), a hunky (though retired) intelligence agent, some misunderstood Iranians..., mercenary Russians (with planes instead of subs), a Russian agent turned killing machine who seems to eliminate life out of compulsion, and no coherent plot to arrange them in, Hagberg has essentially written an earlier version of &quot;Kilo Option&quot;.  <br />What little that can be understood is annoyingly unoriginal, and the ... fundamentalist muslims, scheming Russians, rogue nukes, hunky heroes and Saddan Hussein lack the slightest hint of any development, as if they were off-the-shelf components for some cut-grade weapons system.  If you come upon &quot;Kilo option&quot;, I'd suggest another choice.....	2000-12-21

Too late to back out of the treaty, the Americans face the prospect of Soviet military supremacy established in orbit and working its way down to the surface.  Their only way-out: use a captured Russian helicopter flown by a crack CIA pilot deep into the Soviet military-industrial spaceflight complex near baikonour and rescue the man and his photographic proof.  <br />Were &quot;Winterhawk&quot; the work of any other writer, the CIA pilot would be some handsome but rule-flouting ace hotshot who doesn't let politicians or bureaucrats get in the way of mission he just knows he can pull-off.  But &quot;Winterhawk&quot; is the baby of Craig Thomas, and the maverick is none other than Mitchell Gant, the burnt-out Vietnam air-war vet who barely survived &quot;Firefox&quot; and &quot;Firefox Down&quot;.  Almost saturated with a mentality of defeat, Gant remains ready to thrown in the towel, almost begging for the missile or bullet or karate chop that will end the mission...and his misery.<br />Reuniting with KGB Col. Priabin from &quot;Firefox Down&quot;, &quot;Winterhawk&quot; becomes someting of a sequel to that book and the final leg in a loose trilogy begun with &quot;Firefox&quot;.  Thomas usually arranges his books into loose arcs (like those involving the Russian, Petrunin, and Babbington, the British turncoat of &quot;Lion's Run&quot;, &quot;Wildcat&quot; and &quot;Last Raven&quot;), but there's an insistence on linking the books in time (&quot;Winterhawk&quot; is meant to occur within two years of &quot;Firefox Down&quot;, though the earlier book occurred no later than 1983 when Andropov was still KGB chief, and the events of latter book - including CD's and the Russian space shuttle are clearly late 1980's) andin meaning - with the bloodlust that Gant unwittingly inspired in Priabin in the last book is too great a factor in this one.  <br />Yet Thomas knows better than to write incomplete books, and &quot;Winterhawk&quot; remains absorbing on its own terms.  His writing remains crisp, his prose fast paced and his perspectives delightfully claustrophobic.  Nobody knows what's about to hit them.  Thomas' charachters drive this book, perhaps more than those of &quot;Firefox&quot; and ist sequel - while Gant ruled those books, there isn't a charachter in &quot;Winterhawk&quot; who doesn't threaten to conquer the rest and impose his stamp on the bulk of the novel. When the brutish, almost simian Red Army Col. Serov meets his fate, I almost cried at the possibilities of his appearance in another Thomas epic that will now never be.  Bringing the crew together not only creates a perfectly spaced and timed plot, but creates perhaps the most cinematographic of Thomas' novels.  Instead of building a tale around the hero's sitting in a chair (admittedly an ejector seat within a high-performance jet, but sitting all the same), we have Gant racing through the industrial space complex with parallel subplots involving Priabin and the turncoat Russian scientist, the Red Army General and his son, and a female KGB aid of whom Priabin is &quot;fond of&quot; , all working with each other and against each other, switching sides at a maddening pace building up to a deafening climax.<br />Get this book11	2000-12-17

Broughton, &quot;Going Downtown&quot; reflects on the former fighter pilt's experiences driving USAF  F-105's through the flack, SAM and MiG infested skies of Vietnam.  Readers who missed &quot;Thud Ridge' may remember Broughton's story appearing in the Yeagher biography - a decorated and venerable fighter-pilot, Broughton was loved by the men he led, despite the draconian restrictions placed on them by politicians.  During one mission that Broughton didn't even fly on, two of his pilots received fire from a flak gun aboard a Russian freighter, and responded with their own cannon.  Jaded by the experience in which his pilots were clearly in the right, Broughton removed the gun camera film from the noses of the involved F-105's, and destroyed them.  A board of review composed of such noted officers as Yeager and Robin Olds cleared Broughton's men but did cite Broughton for destruction of the gun camera film, a move that effectively ended his career as a fighter pilot.  Broughton hints at the incident - the &quot;Turkestan Affair&quot; in Thud Ridge, but apparently decided against saying any more.  Having decided otherwise in &quot;Downtown&quot;, Broughton must have decided that he didn't have enough for a new book complimenting the first.  Theough &quot;Turkestan&quot; and its consequences take up the latter half of the book, the first part is a mixed gril, offering the USAF's painful transition to the early and crude jets, the complicated underpinnings of the Vietnam war and the cover-up over the Tonkin Gulf incident.  <br />The problem is that much of this seems out of place here - especially the author's anecdotes about the Air Force's experineces with early jets between Korea and Vietnam.  The jets, which are underpowered and have over-complicated fire-control systems kill more of their own pilots than the enemy, and some - like the F-103 and the F-107 - never make the cut at all.  None of those planes ever appears in Vietnam, and certainly not in Broughton's narrative.  So why does he bother here?  It's as if he realized that he hadn't enough, apart from &quot;Turkestan&quot; that merited a new book, and quicly decided that, besides some anecdotes about the Veitnam airwar overlooked from the first book, he might as well just keep going back, and toss in soem historical background about vietnam and USAF for good measure.  Concluding his survey of the famed &quot;Century Series&quot; fighter jets, Broughton says &quot;something funny was happening in southeast asia.&quot;  But it was nevr clear why he didn't begin with southeast asia and leave all that other stuff behind.  It's important stuff, but would be of better use as something Broughton could reflecton while flying in vietnam - as more of a personal context than an historical one.  Actually, Broughton sells himself short - giving equal time to all subjects when I'd prefer a whole book with him in the F-105.  Considering that he flew the most pivotal missions of his career in that plane, it's incredible that my knowledge of it seems unchanged from when I first opened &quot;Going Downtown.&quot;	2000-12-06

Supposedly, Chuck Yeager has amassed a bad rap, but from his autobiography, it's hard to see why.  The retired USAF General, who went from shooting down German jets in WWII to flying faster than sound before anybody else thought it possible, tells it like it is.  While that won't engender warm feelings, Yeager was obviously a man even his rivals could trust.<br />The General writes of his humble Virginian origins.  Enlisting in the Army as a mechanic, Yeager moved to the pilot's seat through a program intended to put more non-com's into flight-duty.  Yeager displays a true pilot's nostalgia of the days when he writes lovingly of the obsolete P-39's he flew from Oroville (half the P-39's built went to the Red AF under lend/lease).  Getting to England by 1943, Yeager upgraded to the legendary  P-51...only to get shot down by a German FW-190.  Smuggled into neutral Spain and then repatriated, Yeager returned to his unit and then began shooting down German planes, including the Me-262, the first operational jet fighter.  Describing the crude though effective jet, Yeager shows how his mechanic's training and senses made the crucial difference: the early jets, built for high-speed, were vulnerable when approaching their runays for landing.  Because existing jet engines responded slowly and unpredictably - with one engine spooling up much faster than the other - Luftwaffe pilots who tried to speed away from threats a low speeds often got sucked into mysterious and uncontrollable rolls.  It was thus in that vulnerable state that Yeager hunted the vaunted jets.<br />After the war, and on the strength of his having been shot down, Yeager became a test pilot at the famed high-desert testing ground of Edwards AFB.  Though a fighter pilot, it was again Yeager's mechanic's training that made the difference in his selection to pilot the supersonic X-1.  Originally intended for flight by civilian pilots with high-pricetags, the X-1 was grabbed in 1947 by the newly formed US Air Force as a high-profile project whose success would set that service apart from the Army from which it had just been separated.  Successfully taking the X-1 past the sonic barrier, and avoiding numerous would-be disasters, Yeager excelled as a fighter-pilot.  Though rivals with test pilots in other services, it was with civilian pilots that Yeager reveals a true enmity, and for the period NASA pilots in particular.  Paid for their work, these pilots were not likely to satisfy the minimal requirements of flight test - exploring and establish the outer boundaries of an airplane's performance. (Nor were they very good pilots, the General maintains, &quot;proven&quot; by the fatal mid-air collision between the B-70 and a NASA flown F-104 in 1965).  Even the best civilian fliers are flawed pilots, exceling simply because of their readiness to test their flawed assumtpions, as &quot;Wheaties&quot; Welsh did at the controls of an F-100 prototype with a misdesigned vertical stabilizer.<br />Leaving flight-test, Yeager eventually rose to command of a squadron of F-100, a plane revolutionary in that - for its pilots - it inaugurated both missiles and mid-air refueling, and was guaranteed to weed out &quot;weak sisters&quot;.  Yeager's adventures include stints commanding units in Europe during the early cold-war days, Vietnam and Pakistan during the 1970's, as well as more flight test.  He flew with Jaqueline Cochrane, the rich aviatrix who left the scent of perfume in any plane she flew, chatted with Andrei Tupolev and MiG pilots, and flew MiG-15's flown to the west by defectors.  Thruough it all, he rarely rises to being judgemental, though he lets history do it for him - like the way the public largely ignored him and other test-pilots while lavishing attention on Merury pilots whose scientific contributions to flight test were not as great.  At the same time, his ire towards the political forces that inevitably stretched their tentacles out at flight test becomes too great to ignore - such as when one lackluster African American pilot becomes the Kennedy Administration's designated astronaut.<br />&quot;Yeager&quot; is full of insights into the aviation's golden age as well as the Cold War, yet it remains one man's story, and like the Bell X-1, it's a story your strapped into until the end.to ignore - such as when one lackluster African American pilot becomes the Kennedy Administration's designated astronaut. <br />&quot;Yeager&quot; is full of insights into the aviation's golden age as well as the Cold War, yet it remains one man's story, and like the Bell X-1, it's a story your strapped into until the end.	2000-12-03
US	49374774	R1GJMNI9KU4JKB	0816806101	808629854	North American Valkyrie XB-70A - Aero Series 30	Books	4	5	6	N	N	A plane you'd do anything to fly...but pay for the gas	The B-70 was the logical follow-on to existing American strategic bomber designs of the 1950's and represents a typical product of what is now known as &quot;the Golden Age of Aviation&quot;.  During those cold-war days, no idea or design seemed too crazy to merit attention, money, and the lives of test-pilots.  Of these, the B-70 stands out - a plane as big as a large jet liner with a top speed over 3 times the speed of sound and the ability to sustain altitudes of over 70,000 feet (in the days when commercial aviation had received its first jets) - if only because the B-70 actually delivered.  <br />Two prototypes were built and ably demonstrated their ability to attain the lofty goals of their designers.  Instead, it was the age that doomed the triple-sonic bomber.  The concept of high-altitude level bombing, already proven outdated in the Korean skies, seemed medeival by the days when Robert Mcnamara ruled the Defense Dept., and the Valkyrie's huge price-tag couldn't have helped.  While the Valkyrie program would have been doomed by the proliferation of Russian air defense missile technology (which had claimed at least 2 high altitude U-2 spy planes by the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis) and the development of a Russian fighter fast enough to catch the bomber, these factors had less to do with cancelling the program than justifying its demise in hindsight.  While the U-2 shootdowns traumatized American planners, latter experiences of American aviators over Vietnam shows how little attention planners gave to Russian desgned SAM's in terms of equipment, training and tactics.  One would have to attribute to Mr. Mcnamara and military planners, two widely divergent opinions regarding Russian missiles relating to both the B-70 and Vietnam.  American aircrews had to leanr from scratch in Vietnam the complicated science of air combat in the missile age.  For existing bombers like the B-52, high-altitude level bombing remained the rule.  Neither can rumors of the mystery Russian figher with a Mach-3 top speed be taken as a serious factor in the B-70's cancellation - that plane, the MiG-25, hadn't even flown by 1964, when the Valkyrie was already a lame duck.  Until then, the MiG was merely a collection of unsubstantiated rumors unlikely to merit attention in Washington (and certainly too insignificant to save from cancellation the Mach-3 fighter program).  Most likely, the B-70 fell victim to a general aversion to all manned bomber in favor of ICBM's.  Besides the apathy towards SAM's demosntrated in Vietnam and the obscure (at best) threat of the MiG-25, consider the fact that once the Valkyrie was cancelled, the military made no efforts to find a replacement.  (In contrast, the gap left by cancellation of the F-111B was immediately filed by the F-14).  as a result, B-52's were still flying combat missions nearly two decades after our pullout from Vietnam.  More overt antipathy to manned bombers helped kibbosh the B-70's purported successor, the B-1A, and nearly doom the B-1B.  Defense contractions after Vietnam, a shift towards low-level penetration and electronic arfare, and SALT talks of the early 1970's further make the image of active service B-70's further surreal.  <br />In fact, given how spectacularly the plane performed, it's astonishing that it remained surrounded by a cloud of doom.  the authors give the B-70 the full survey - tracing its origins in the anything-goes age of Curtis le May, to its demise in the fiscally conservative Mcnamara days.  The authors take no sides in the controversy over the Valkyrie, even remain restrained when retelling of the tragic and purposeless destruction of the second prototype -lost in a freak collision with a NASA-flown  F-104.  The incident occurred, not during some test, but during a photo-op (both planes used GE-built engines).  Nevertheless, it remains for the end for the authors to reveal a sense of sentimentality towrads the plane.  Leaving the surviving first prototype on theramp in Dayton, where it would become an exhibit at the USAF museum, the last Valkyrie pilots walk away seemingly impassive.  If either of them looked back at the mighty (and now earthbound) beast, they would never tell.	2000-11-29

US	49374774	RG6QOMWHWD4MD	0886773016	489254517	Dancer of Gor	Books	1	16	31	N	N	Repellant wish fulfillment	Doreen, a shy librarian who secretly practices bellydancing between the stacks after hours, is kidnapped by slavers from the wild planet of Gor. Somehow frozen in a state resembling the Hyborian Age of Robert E. Howard's \\"Conan\\" books (and every sword and sandal tale ever told), Gor forces its men to become warriors while the women become \\"living jewels of desire\\". On that \\"wild counter-earth\\", enslaved Doreen's floorwork makes her the local star, even though (as with all slaves) her individual situation approximates a souvenir brought back from a long trip, like a switch-comb, or one of those novelty pens. Whereas modern bellydancers stress their art as liberating and empowering women - that images of slave girls in gauzy skirts performing for men is just a Hollywood myth - Gor creator John Norman buys into that \\"myth\\" completely: Doreen's dancing really is an act of submission set to rhythm. Driven into exile by an un-wanted competitor, Doreen finds herself in the forefront of war between competing city-states on Gor.  For reasons not made quite clear, Doreen's dancing makes her a crucial factor in a massive Gorean civil war - but she remains too much of a slave to exploit that position.    I'm ashamed to admit I read \\"Dancer\\" - not ashamed because of the book's purportedly hot subject matter, rather the opposite: \\"Dancer\\" is long, pedantic and boring, with no payoff.  There's little excitement to be found in the brutal treatment typical of slaves in \\"Dancer\\" which is little better than that given to animals.  This doesn't bode well for Gor's male population either. (Gor is supposed to be a wild and adventurous version of Earth, but Gorean men manage to go to extremes for a pitifully shorter and less erotic coupling than paler and weaker Earthmen would aspire to.) Not even the author's emphasis on bellydancing - which he assures us really is about female submission - seems to bring out its sexier side.     But the worst conceit is Doreen herself. In Norman's prose, Doreen is meant to stand in for all modern women - outwardly liberated, educated and assertive, a destroyer of men and manhood; on the inside, entirely submissive, passionate and dependent on male power.  Enamored with the idea of those days of yore (when women were women), Norman crafts a tale of a modern womanhood's descent into submission, with Doreen leading the fall. The problem is that Doreen is so transparently weak from the outset, that it's impossible to imagine her as a convincing modern woman at all - the only reason we have to think that Doreen is a modern anything is because she says so, repeatedly.  (When Gorean scouts first encounter Doreen, their leader rhetorically asks her if she's a \\"modern woman\\".  If shy Doreen is the Gorean idea of a modern women who \\"destroy men\\", the rest of Earth's women are safe.)  Because she's already a slave waiting for her chains on page 1., Doreen's story of submission is pretty much over as soon as it starts, and \\"Dancer\\" discards the plot element of \\"transition\\" critical to any tale of fantasy.  About the only transition Doreen achieves by the story's end is that she can now openly refer to bellydance by that name, and not \\"ethnic dance\\", which connotes PC pretension.  Norman's error is in identifying modern women by their intelligence alone rather than strength of character, which says more about him than his bellydancing anti-heroine.  Doreen is smart - her slave visions are out of library books and not movies - but submits to the slave collar with little problem.  Worse, because she's smart and submissive, Doreen never becomes an interesting character, as she calmly describes the ordeals of being a slave almost as if they were occurring to someone else, and that \\"other\\" person doesn't seem worth Doreen's efforts.  I've heard all of the canned diatribes about white male wish fullfillment, and this book ironically debunks every one of them - there's nary a word here to satisfy anybody's wishes.  For anybody considering spending their hard earned cash to get \\"Dancer\\" on eBay, consider this your warning.	2000-11-15

With nothing remotely capable of matching the super-jet on their drawing boards, British and American spymatsers hit on a seemingly impossible, virtually suicidal plan: send one of their pilots into Russia - into the Russians' high-security flight-test center - to find the super plane, and steal it.  Complicating things is Mitchell Gant, the west's designated skyjacker, a burnt out Viet Nam vet who test flew captured Russian planes for the CIA.  Scarred within after being shotdown, Gant's plods on, begging to be discovered and put out of his misery.<br />Like the plan, &quot;Fireox&quot; the novel seems like a no-brainer - Craig Thomas seems unsure of his hold on military technology, and by his prose, you'd never confuse him with other authors who've done the stuff they've written about (like fly planes and get shot at).  Instead, Thomas' crisp prose, an almost constant state of tension and an almost supersonic pacing put &quot;Firefox&quot; ahead of just about any other aviation technothriller.  Bets of all are the flying scenes.  While other writers boast of being able to put the reader inside the cockpit of a high-performance fighter - only Thomas delivers.  Unlike other authors, Thomas knows the tension, stark terror and gallons of adrenaline that a fighter pilot can be expected to go through while trapped in a dogfight.  Then there's Thomas' hero - Gant.  Thomas' conceit is that Gant's superiors were so ready to see there case fail, that they chose the one man least capable of pulling it off.  Gant is unlike any technothriller writer you've ever read about - he begins the novel trapped in a chronic nervous breakdown.  Yet he excels over the cardboard charachters of other books who just push buttons and read computer screens.  Those charachters just register information - Gant actually experiences it as real people would.  With the exception of &quot;Flight ofthe Intruder&quot;, and Thomas' other Mitchell Gant novels, this is probably the best air-war thriller you'll read.  Sequels included &quot;Firefox Down&quot;, &quot;Winterhawk&quot; and &quot;A Different War&quot; - &quot;Winterhawk&quot; being my favorite story, but never outrunning the flying scenes of &quot;Firefox&quot;.	2000-11-14

Halahan's hero, the last resident or a building slated for demolition, keeps hearing a mysterious whooshing sound.  Surrounded by an oddball motley of charachters - his next door neighbor boasts of his excommunication; the saner charchters have already left the building, or have mysteriously vanished - the hero looses a sense of the ordered world, and soon of anything else but his imminent doom.  And that's only half the story - as an English historian combs the New York area looking for the last descendants of a colonial-era merchant named Joseph Tulley.  Neither plot has anything to do with the other - it seems - but you won't mind since much of the book succeeds without your having to know what it's about.  Instead, Halahan relies on an almost pure sense of dread hanging over the charachters.  Though Halahan has the hero's building slated for condemnation, he positions it at the center of the coldest, darkest winter, as if it were about to fall into a black hole before a wrecking ball ever appeared.  By the end, too many questions go unanswered for their to be a real twist.  Still, Halahan delivers a climax so powerful, you'll never notice the difference.	2000-11-12

The HMS Ulysses was built for one mission - escorting convoys from Scotland to Murmansk in Russia to deliver supplies Russia needs to keep the Wehrmacht on the run on the eastern front. By 1943, the tide of the war had turned against the Axis on every front but the Atlantic. Worn down by the arctic storms, by constant attacks from German subs, dive bombers and cruisers, by outbreaks of TB and the constant threat of the mighty Battleship Tirpitz, Ulysses is a ship coming apart at the seams. The only thing holding the crew and ship together is there respect for its young and ailing captain and the desperation of the allied war effort. Their superiors in Admiralty would gladly supply less outdated escorts with more experienced crews, or replace their undersized (and outgunned) escort jeep carriers with fleet aircraft carriers - if that were available. But disintegrate the ship does, under attack by u-boats, Hipper-class cruisers, Condor bombers and the ceaseless assault of the Arctic. McLean does a superlative job taking both crew and vaunted ship apart. While he doesn't glorify war, he doesn't stoop at taking cheap shots at those who lead the war-effort either, and those who made critical decisions leading up to the tragedy of convoy &quot;PQ-17&quot; are given their due. (don't worry if you don't know a thing about PQ-17 - McLean gives aperfect intro). Neither does McLean stoop to gory effects. &quot;Ulysses&quot; neither glorifies war nor condemns it with cheap tactics. The horrors of war are enough for that, and McLean's prose do that - sort of like &quot;Private Ryan&quot; at sea....	2000-11-09

Those populating the unnamed city of Ben Katchor's extended graphic novel are essentially gripped by nostalgia for a way of life that probably never existed.  In cartoon vignettes, they pine for the days when you could visit the famed &quot;Pygmy Penitentiary&quot; (attempted breakouts scheduled every hour) and pick up some of Virosh Sherue's bottled rain water on the way home.  Many try to preserve their way of life, if only because they fear change (&quot;Static Day&quot; is an official holiday) and grab a hold on the present as if it were a lifeline (one man has dozens of items on lay-away in stores thruought the city, because the goods are kept perpetually new until he has to pick them up).  And the city doesn't lack for opportunists - like street toughs who scavenge TV antennae from buildings that have gone cable; tour operators who bus tourists through the decayed parts of the city (the driver soon becomes the primaddona) or show biz operators who conceive of turning manual labor into public spectacle.  For much of the city, it's business as usual as reporters for the vile evening combinator scour the city for tales of the dreams of its populace, or as bra-strap statisticians try to chart the rise and fall of the city's fortunes.  The titular real estate photographer notes all dispassionately.  Katchor parodies and mourns his citizens at the same time, yet he never condescends to them not tries to milk them for tears.  Instead, Katchor, through the lens of his alter ego, a real estate photographer seems to have mastered the perfect balance of bittersweet, a quest that, for his charachters, seems one more casualty lost to the years.	2000-11-05

We get to see our favorite characters before they became our favorite characters. (Almost every time, we learn why the author offered us what he had) In \\"Dune: House Atreides\\" we meet the heroic and ultimately martyred Leto Atreides, the vile Vlad Harkonnen, and Shaddam - the future emperor of the known universe. In addition to other charachters also already established in Dune lore, we meet the royal family of Ix, exiled when their world is overrun by the insidious Bene Tleilax, and Leto's father, Duke Paulus. Though its title suggests the heroic (though ultimately despotic) Atreides are the focus, \\"House Atreides' tells as much about them as the Harkonnen. Actually, Shaddam IV, 38 years old and yet still just a prince, gets the lion's share of attention. With his father Elrood giving no hint of giving up the throne - kept alive through addiction to the spice melange - Shaddam conspires with his lifelong friend, the deadly Hasimir Fenring to end the emperor's reign. It's the authors' inability to focus on a single charachter - \\"Atreides\\" is intended as one of those \\"sweeping\\" novels - that waters the book down (no pun intended). None of the intense plotting, de rigeur for a Dune novel, becomes very intense here. There's no depth. Fenring, a master of the art of murder, is actually deadliest when he's just giving advice. Here however, he's just annoying, and his plotting hardly rises to macchiavellian - coaxing Shaddim into regicide, or into a scheme to develop a synthetic substiture for melange, or take a bene gesserit for a wife become perfunctory exercises unworthy for the future count and master of assassins. Neither Anderson nor Herbert develop Fenring in a way that would suggest his complete reversal in the climax of \\"Dune\\". The Bene gesserit themselves do little that should arouse suspicion, even though their plan to breed the messianic Kwisatz Haderach should be enough to raise a quarrel with the Spacing Guild, if not the emperor and the Landsraad and just about everybody else. Such a conflict between the BG and the guild - representing the two most established and immovable factions populating the Dune universe - should have been the focus of \\"Atreides\\". Instead, and unwisely, it's the illegal invasion of Ix that unite the charachters in this book - hardly a cause worthy of the heroic Leto. (the ruling house of Ix, a world dedicated to technological development, is exiled when their subjects who do the most work are moved to revolt; you need not be marxist to be unsympathetic given the ease by which the revolt succeeds.) The authors couldn't even be bothered to flesh out the age old conflict between Atreides and Harkonnen, a hole big enough to float a guild highliner through. Another hole is Leto's murdered father - described offhand as a cruel blowhard in the original \\"Dune\\", he's now a happy-go-lucky type that nobody could hate.  But worst of all is Shaddam's collusion with the vile Tleilaxu - in which he backs their invasion of Ix in return for their development of a synthetic substitute for melange.  The plot is ludicrous as success would give the Tleilaxu a chunk of the monopoly on spice production without their owing anything to the emperor (who at least exerts his control through his de facto directorship of the CHOAM conglomerate).  I mean, if the Tleilaxu renged, how would Shaddam enforce his end?  The unblanced deal would make sense had Shaddam nursed a vendetta against the Ixians - but the grudge against them was not Shaddam's, but Elrood's.  <br />Because \\"Atreides\\" is the first of a series, the authors haven't bothered themselves to make it whole and singular. Some parts of the book don't come together at all - like the expeditons of planetologist Liet Kynes or the story of C'tair, a loyal Ixian working against the Tleilax invaders. But worst of all, the novel lacks a solid voice, a single perspective in its scenes to feel the pain, joy, fear and triumph that all the plotting must create. \\"Atreides\\" simply fails because, unlike the spice melange that underlies much of the plotting, it is neither addictive nor conciouness expanding.	2000-11-05

In &quot;Snow Falcon&quot;, the red army is preparing a lightning strike on NATO intended to coincide with a coup against the communist party.

Unlike most technothriller authors, Craig Thomas' plots don't rely on twists or surpirses; tension is built simply on the heroes pluck to hold out - almost reluctantly - against overwhelming odds.  In &quot;Falcon&quot;, the hero is not the intrepid British agent, but the stalwart KGB colonel who stumbles on plans for the invasion and the coup (which does come off as a twist despite WInterhawk) before having to dodge a small army of troops, helicopters and ceaseless frost.  Definately among Thomas' best.	2000-11-02

The Bedford has the firepower to sweep the red sub away like so much dust on the sea.  But cold war politics and some substantial realities require that the Bedford do no more than track the sub.  More than mere politics, the Bedford's obsessed captain knows that the Russian sub, running on diesel-electric engines, can endure no more than hours submerged before it must surface to recharge.  With the Red Navy soon to become nuclear-powered, the Bedford knows that its latest find may be its last easy catch.  &quot;Easy&quot; becomes illusory as the Bedford fights a war of nerves against the Russian crew while battling cruel northern seas and endless ice.  Rascovich never shows us the Russian crew, only the tensions faced by the Americans, and the seams that are quickly becoming undone.  <br />&quot;Bedford&quot; recalls Moby Dick, but it actualy belongs to a small genre of war-thrillers involving hunter killer subs in cold northern seas, great books like Poyer's &quot;The Circle&quot; and &quot;HMS Ulysses&quot; by Maclean.  The book was turned into a greta moview starring Richard Widmark as the Bedford's tormented captain and Sidney Poitier as the civilian photojournalist who quickly becomes his conscience.

US	49374774	RUFSGLLYVIDDY	0394722744	255418638	Son of the Revolution	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Angela's Ashes in Red China	When consolidating their rule over the most populous nation on Earth, the Red Chinese sought to create a modern industrialized state in place of a feudal and disorganized one.  Requiring more than rapid industrialization to realize their goals, the communists also sought to suffuse every sector of Chinese society with rigid political mentality requiring not only strict party loyalty, but a state of constant revolution, in which individuals and communities constantly sought to prove their mastery of &quot;revolutionary discipline&quot;.  Various miniature revolutions shake China - turning friends and relatives against each other - with fearful consequences for those who couldn't convince the more politically reliable of their strongly &quot;revolutionary&quot; desires.  Because the meaning of the revolution itself is vague, even those who would have thought their backgrounds free of &quot;black marks&quot;, find themselves under the gun - whether because of views an individual no longer professes, or association with others having displayed a lack of revolutionary discipline or simply because one may comply with a dictate only to find the Party changed direction completely.<br />Liang Heng, whose birth coincided with Ho Chi Minh's epic victory over the French in 1954, suffered for all the above reasons.  Never a &quot;rightist&quot; himself, Heng suffered horribly during China's ten year political unrest of the 1960's and 70's.  Heng's mother, a loyal party member in the late 1950's, reluctantly obeys the party's order to criticize superiors during the &quot;Hundred Flowers&quot; movement.  Heng, like many, is never sure if the follow-up to the &quot;Flowers&quot; (in which those who faithfully criticized their elders were then rounded up for their insuboridination) was a knee jerk reaction to the unexpected ferocity the earlier campaign engendered, or whether the earlier movement was intended to weed out those critics to begin with.  Only the consequences - in whichHeng's mother must wear the feared &quot;rightist cap&quot;, forever soilng her revolutionary record and that of her family - is considered.  When Heng's father, who writes for the Hunan daily, becomes suspect for his admitted youthful infatuation with the nationalistic Koumintang, the family's political reputation suffers even more.  Though loyal communists, Heng finds his father's name listed as an enemy on the many revolutioanry placards around their home city of Changsha.  The Party maxim's - stressing tolerance for those whose backgrounds evince youthful mistakes - does little for Heng, since the revolution is guided by fervor and not nuance.  And, though Maosim meant that party loyalty superceded family loyalty (sorry Confucious), it didn't prevent family members from suffering for political sins of family members.<br />Through the turmoil - which evolves from parades to open warfare in the street using everything from sticks and stones to missiles - Heng avoids sanctimony.  Heng suffered much of the chaos as a child, and isn't above admitting that he too wrote some revolutionary placards himself.  He works hard to rehabilitate his father whose first major action is to cast out Heng's mother for her &quot;rightist cap&quot;.  Experience proved the decision, for its pain, proved correct, if insufficient, to protect the family.  &quot;Old Liang&quot; himself suffered mightily for the cause, never once complaining.  As a middle-aged exile, forced to bring the revolution to the peasants by joing them, Heng's father survived the indiginities of a country-bound city-types, never pausing to warm the lives of the peasants with Marxist fervor.  Heng's private revolution, unlike the larger one surrounding him, is about nuance, and the narrative never attempts to surpass the perspective of a child of Heng's age during the cultural revolution.  Like the more recent &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;, Heng knows that the more credible narrator is the one who feels and experiencesrather than faithfully records.  And the experience, rather than one of victimization is of survival.  The revolution's true enemies are long gone by the time the cultural revolution degenerates into civil war, and only Heng's clear and non-judgmental narrative can spot that the war's victims and instigators are one and the same.	2000-10-23

In no particular order, it claims to be a diary - a journal of daily goings on, both mundane and monumental, but all pretty much exhibiting the narrator's consignment to the prison of the here and now.  Bereft of any foreshadowing, a true journal has no apparent sense of the was and would be.  But author Louis Auchincloss never gives his unappealing protagonist the sense of being the center of his universe and living only for the moment.  Instead, the hero is constantly pronouncing - it was not to be, or that plans were not going to work out.  Worse, the protagonist is not even the central moral authority - that role goes to the hero's wife, constantly exposing the hero's shallowness.  It's hard to believe that the central charachter is so self-centered when he yields the central role of his own story to another.  Being that the self-centered hero isn't self-centered enough to own his own book, it's hard to visualize him as a yuppie - one of those trend-hungry, status-seeking urban denizens rendered extinct in the late-1980's.  All charachters in &quot;Diary&quot; seem too &quot;old-money&quot;, too entrenched in the old order that true Yuppies committed themselves to destroying.  Auchincloss' yuppie is the last guy in the world you'd see lighting up - let alone inhaling.  The hero's cultural background is too old-fashioned for those homo-sapiens who brought CD's to the market and fought the stigmas of multiple bankruptcy or early retirement.  Even the idea of a journal seems closer to the self-absorbed slacker 1990's than the yuppie's that Auchincloss wants to portray.  As a poorly conceived depiction of Yuppie-dom, &quot;Diary&quot; fails to satisfy, with the hero's moral dilemmas involving less of the hero than his reaction to the sufferings of others - abandones law partners, ex-wives, colleagues and relatives.  This is the novel where the hero's greatest challenege is whether to stick with the upper-crust lawfirm that had nurtured him from law school.  Pack it in your Beamer and forget about it.	2000-10-16

Beginning in the early 20th century and progressing with wartime Germany's co-opting of rocket science, we see a hobby for dilettantes become a mortally serios scientific endaevor.  America's efforts, long considered lackluster throuought the war, had progressed far enough by its end to have surpassed the work of Robert Goddard, America's homegrown rocket-visionary.  Progressing through the cold-war, overcoming Eisenhower's warnings of the big government needed to run both warlike and peaceful space efforts, the space race accelerates the pace of military technology and the military-industril complex, even as the US gov't strives to present civilian applications for rockets - manned exploration and satellites.  As comprehensive a work as this, the author sometimes swamped by his own history.  That the author can display a definite bias against manned spaceflight seems less a black mark against this heavy tome than a reminder that he has reoriented himself.  A heavy work you'll have to read over and over.	2000-10-13

After seeing the dissappointing film, I was unexpectedly shocked to discover how I could be absorbed by amoral heroine and her challenges.  Mostly, this is thanks to Paul Theroux's crisp and inviting prose.  While today's authors repeatedly assure us of their expert credentials in writing technothrillers, political thrillers, historical fiction, legal thrillers and so on, only Paul Theroux triumphs on an endless and rariefied reservoir of dissassociation, being an alien and an outsider.  Dr. Slaughter, a brilliant and beautiful specialist in petro-economics, is already well versed in using sexual favors to supplement a meager income when she becomes &quot;an escort&quot;.  Using her dissassociation as a shield against the monumental dreariness of her existence (her miserable flat in London seems perpetually frozen), she prospers, never realizing her proximity to the true love that eludes her or the danger she places others into.  The revelation at the end seems no surprise, yet packs an emotional wallop.	2000-10-11

The Mir Orbiting station, launched in 1986, is easily the longest lived manned structure in space.  Never meant to survive more than 11 years, Mir is plagued by age and the complexities of orbital survival.  Unlike a spaceship or airplane - designed and built completely before being put into service, the Mir has grown steadily since its first launch, but hasn't been able to come to terms with the junk amassed by its age, to say nothing of the technological nightmare bred by the collapse of the russian economy.  The end of the cold war illustrated how the Russians parralleled or even surpassed western technology.  While the west had no space station of its own (with the long-ago demise of skylab), the Mir showed how far behind the Russians had fallen in terms of managing their manned space program.  This proved painfully apparent when NASA, seeking to justify its own gloriously unneccessary manned space program, proposed a joint venture of sending astronauts onto Mir using Soyuz rockets and the US shuttle.  <br />&quot;Dragonfly&quot; tells the story of the trials and triumphs (mostly trials) faced by Astronaut and Cosmonaut alike.  Many problems dealt with the Mir itself - its aging gyroscopes, power blackouts and leaking coolant played havoc with its occupants.  But these problems pale by comparison to a fire caused by a faulty oxygen generator, and a catastrophic crash involving an unmanned re-supply ship.  But all problems are dwarfed by the sheer complexity of the Mir itself, which has aged beyond its owners memory.  When turning up some part that may need to be replaced, both Russians on the ground and in orbit are stumped - just where did the mystery part come from and what is it supposed to do?  The image of clue-less Russians, at the mercy of their seemingly clueless bureaucratic superiors on the ground, so perfectly meshes with cold war stereotypes of communist party hacks, that a bit of John Birch gloating would have been acceptable.<br />Instead, author Bryan Burrough - who chronicled the campiness of the corporate LBO-fever in &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; - is surprisingly touching in the plight of Mir's occupants.  The cosmonauts are the last of a breed of a once proud corps of manned-space travlers.  Though determined to succeed, every bit of bad luck space travel has to offer seems reserved for them.  The astronauts are similarly cursed: accustomed to flights lasting little more than a week, the poorly planned schedules that last a month drive the astronauts into nervous exhaustion.  Tensions between the Russians and Americans are heightened further between US worries over Mir (and the need for the Russians to abandon Mir and concentrate on the more ambitious US effort) and Russia's determination to softpedal Mir's problems, no matter how heavily they endanger lives.  Worse, Mir, the Russians soon learn, doesn't even attract the best astronauts.  Instead, astronauts who couldn't wait to get into space, or who had long since run afoul of NASA and spoiled their chances for a shuttle mission, become Mir's prime candidates.  Most of the astronauts adapt painfully.  Shannon Lucid, however, thrives, earning accolades from all - except from the other Mir astronauts.<br />Burrough avoids playing &quot;Dragonfly&quot; for laughs.  Unfortunately, he holds back too much, and his history touches on various topics that may even merit their own books - such as NASA's own manned-exploration programs, and its byzantine selection processes.  The author also hints at cold-war soviet space programs, which couldn't have been run that much better.  He also touches on the usual suspects - US politics and a seeming hydra of Russian mafioso that infect every aspect of post-soviet rule.  What we've got is an ambitious effort that tries to go in every direction.  Well worth a read.	2000-10-03

In the &quot;March of Folly&quot;, historian Barbara Tuchman surveys four  episodes in history - disparate in culture, chronlogy and geography but  otherwise united in folly by the ruling leadership.  Tuchman defines folly  as the pursuit policy contraryr to self-interest.  Self-interest is not to  be confused with selfihsness, can be understood as the course that gives  those who follow it the greatest benefit, whether the benefit is perceived  as such.  The Trojans fail to heed the warning of Greeks bearing gifts; The  renaissance papacy provokes a protest; the British lose America and America  loses Vietnam.  In each of Tuchman's episodes, man's leadership not only  trails his advances in science and the arts, but is actually inverse in  relation.  Tuchman's prose is always crisp and inviting and her analysis  rarely lacks any power.  Unfortunately, her thesis is not flawless - folly  is meant to represent self-inflicted harm by government policy.  This is  meant to be uncomplicated by moral decisions which, given the actors  involved, is not to be expected.  Governments are expected to act in ways  that benefit themselves.  Nevertheless, self-interest is not selfishness,  which, when coupled with greed or blind ambition, does more harm than  benefit.  (Often, a government's self-interest is to act morally, not based  on any innate good, but merely because this legitmizes its rule over the  people who prefer to see themselves on a moral high-ground.)  The problem  lies in Tuchman's equating any lack of good government with active  self-harming policy, even the two shouldn't share an equal footing.   Active, if ill-informed policy-making mires America in Vietnam, while the  Trojans all but knock down their walls to make way for that Greek horse.   On the flip side, British policy in the colonies seems clumsy, indicating  that those for or against the colonies were incapable of formulating a  cogent policy - the bane of a purely parliamentary system.  Most  lamentable, but also the most absorbing, is the case of the renaissance  popes.  Being at once the product of the college of cardinals and also the  architect of its new generation, the renassance popes can do no more than  prolong a corrupted system that bestowed upon them the papal tiara.  Of the  six popes cited, three actively pursue policy - while the remaining can do  no more than continually tax christendom (especially the disunited German  states), pursue confused alliances, arrange for lavish parties and deplete  papal reserves.  Under Tuchman's definition, self-harming policy is too  inclusive of leadership incapable of forming policy.  The corruption that  bred the renaissance papacy was clearly endemic to the church of that era -  with greed and manipulation of religion hardly limited to the seat of St.  Peter - so it's hard to fault the popes.  Tuchman clearly understands when  recounting the reproach given to the future Leo X, that, were the Cardinals  better men, they'd elect better popes, and all men would be better for it.   Unfortunately, as Tuchman notes, the Renaissance Cardinals could not be  better men because they were chosen by the poor popes to begin with, while  the Popes are stymied by the fact that they were chosen by an earlier  generation of imperfect cardinals.  How Rome broke this cycle, vindicating  Tuchman by proving the papacy capable of doing so, gets too little shrift.   In fact, the renaissance papacy, while corrupt, was also remarkably  tolerant, and the reformation that it bred held dire consequences in terms  of war and religious persecution of the Jews, every bit as painful as the  machivellian schemeing of the pre-protestant papacy.  It's all  exasperating, heart-breaking and entertaining, but one wonders whether  these episodes should have gotten their own book.	2000-09-18

A potentially absorbing plot succumbs to mind-numbingly pedestrian prose  in &quot;Terminal&quot;.  The hero, a promising young medical genius named  Sean Murphy uncovers signs that all is not right in a prestigious Florida  medical research lab that may have just discovered the cure for cancer.   There are hints of Murphy's checkered past, but they remain hints less  because of mystery than the author's inability to deal with his charachters  and have them deal with each other.  Before long, it's clear that  &quot;Terminal&quot; is a work in progress, and not that far along.  There  are numerous subplots - Murphy's past being one, while a serial killer is  another - that never come together and cause what's left to unravel.  The  author tosses in a wealth of medical detail that is supposed to ensconce  him as the master of the medical thriller, but even that fails to suspend  our belief.  I doubt a firts year resident, writing in bits and pieces at  the end of every 36-hour shift, could do worse than this.	2000-09-01
US	49374774	RUHEHENRGOJOY	0380786982	495928980	Moonwar	Books	1	1	1	N	N	Seal this off	&quot;Moonrise&quot;, the prequel to &quot;Moonwar&quot; was less than compelling reading - the conception of a workable, and non-government  funded, lunar base wasn't enough to back up a plot about the rigors of  lunar exploration and the addition of a culture war between foes and  friends of the futuristic &quot;nanotechnology&quot; didn't help.   Nanotechnology, in which miniature robots either build or demolish in any  situation, sparked a war between futuristic visionaries and irredeemably  fundamentalist holy-warriors modeled on the Taliban.  Bova never hid where  he stood on that issue, even though the technology itself remained too  vague and exotic - as if his miniature robots existed only to soothe over  the technological hurdles that one would expect to confront in building  offworld bases and spaceships, light off a Kulturkampf and reveal the  hypocrisy of those who piously rail against the technology while secretly  exploiting it for themeselves.  Gratuitous muder and rape are tossed in in  case the greed, insatiable lust for power and pious right-wing extremism  aren't enough to make the case for the villains any clearer.  The  nanite-controversy could have been it's own book.  Instead, it provides a  mere backdrop to some story about the efforts to build (or destroy) the  Stavenger lunar station.<br />In &quot;Moonwar&quot;, Bova eschews the longer  time-frame that robbed &quot;Moonrise&quot; of a coherent plot - we get a  single generation of heroes, even though they're no more sympathetic than  those of the earlier book.  A power-mad UN Secretary General (a surprise  given the book's all but avowed left leanings) is determined to claim the  Stavenger Lunar station by any means neccesary, even if that means hooking  up with the resurgent crazed fundamentalists who oppose the moonbase as a  symbol of nanotechnology.  Called nano-luddites (I would have suggested  &quot;Tehnololiban&quot; &quot;dot-com-eKazes&quot; or  &quot;Mech-Governites&quot;), these suicide warriors are aimed at the  moonbase like smartbombs.  But Bova - after two books - has failed to  create heroes (targest) worth identifying with.  We're supposed to decry  the evil UN and it's French-Canadian head (damned Quebecer, the book rails,  but it's not up there with stock cold-war labels), but I was never sure why  I should bother.  The bright line between piety and science seems to infect  all the books I've read by Bova (besides &quot;Moonrise&quot;, I've read  the two Mars novels) like the nanites.  &quot;Moonwar&quot; suffers this  infection worst of all.	2000-08-30

Wilson is a bit of a  corpse himself, a one time driver of attack jets until an unlucky mission  over Vietnam led to a stint as a POW.  Suffice it to say that Wilson is now  a spectator to other Top Guns.  When one of these top guns, a female F-14  pilot, is found dead in the bowels of the mighty carrier, Wilson springs to  action - but remains a corpse.  Wilson's job is complicated by the fact  that an aircraft carrier is is less a ship than a floating city, with a  milliuon places to hide and small illegal communities that breed or mask  sinister agendas.  <br />It's an awesome premise for a book, but it doesn't  quite work because author Morton never solves the mystery - only reshapes  it like a lump of clay that never had a form of its own to lose.   Charachters never reveal their secrets, they emote feelings which is  supposed to stand in for dialog - but doesn't.  That actually works for  some charachters who have a lot to feel angry about - like sailors who take  the dirty jobs that keep the carrier steaming or surface officers who were  failed aviators never freed from their dreams of mach two glory.  But other  charachter seem unlikley reservoirs of resentment, like the victims'  squadronmates - the fighter drivers who should be on top of the world - are  the ones who should be attracting the most suspicion, if only because of  their proximity to the dead flier.  Morton keeps things opaque, drowning  the mystery in darkness.  I gave up trying to care who the murderer was -  dark souls in a dark world are no great discovery.	2000-08-25

That Area-51 may be the most secure airfield (or whatever field) on Earth, but it gets visited routinely in novels like &quot;Forbidden Summit&quot;.   Not since the 1970's with shows like &quot;In Search Of...&quot; has the  link between native americans and ufo's gotten any real fleshing.  And it  doesn't here either unfortunately.  Author Harrison is working on a smaller  scale than he had with &quot;Thunder of Erebus&quot; and his story doesn't  get much farther than an elaborate chase story as a grizzled USAF officer  nearing retirement and his impromptu girlfirend get swept up into a  cross-country chase.  <br />Unfortunately, Harrison never fleshes out the  story of the UFO conspiracy besides taking it very seriously.  That's a  mistake - even the X-files knew to set their funniest episode inside  Area-51.  Harrison, on the other hand takes it seriously, but allows a few  gaffes that require serious belief suspension - like the security force for  this government cabal being unable to nab our heroes, or even realize that  their top-secret base isn't as secure as they imagine (a crazy old hermit  knows just how to get in and out).  Worse, the author's sense of gullible  readers spill onto his own charachters, and it takes very little for  suspicions to turn towards UFOs.  Finding rectangular indentations on the  desert floor may mean a great many different things to different people,  but Harrison's hero can come to one conclusion (we're not alone! ) with  the gravity that's supposed to equal that of the apes at the monolith in  the opening of 2001.  There actually is an ironic twist in this book, only  it's a shame that it relies on our being distracted by trite plot ideas and  contrived coincidences (the hero's nemesis is the same officer who's been  making his career a hell for years) and gullible charachters.	2000-08-25

Only a small inuit boy  stirs up Smilla's smoldering self hatred and forces her to look back  towards the frozen Greenland of her birth.  Young Isiah is meant to mirror  Smila at the age before her detachment from home became permanent, and he  she becomes the mother figure his own drunken and unemployed mother is not.   When the boy dies, Smilla barely hesitates to suspect murder, not only  because of her love for him but because he is her only connection to the  rest of humanity.  Her search puts her in conflict with Copenhagen's police  who would like to put closure on the case, and with the boy's father's  employer - a large mining company making periodic surveys to Greenland.  It  also forces her towards her father, a prominent Danish doctor and the man  she hates the most.<br />Hoeg has created less a mystery than a complex drama  in which the heroine is the most dispassionate charachter.  Nothing will  bring back Isiah, and Hoeg resists the urge to turn Smilla's antagonists  into oppressive and unsympathetic goliath figures.  While Smilla never  attracts sympathy or reader identification, Hoeg's ecxploration saves her  from becoming a cypher.  The plot itself, though, when forced to reveal  itself, is unsatisfying and doesn't seem to do its protagonist or the prose  any justice.  The day after you've finished the last page, you've forgotten  the climax.  But you'll still be shivering.	2000-08-24

In &quot;Bogey's and bandits&quot;, Robert Gandt takes on the job of  detailing just who manages to go from one-of-us to King of the Sky by  following the pitfalls and triumphs of a class of Navy and Marine aviators  learning to fly the F/A-18 fighter, aka the &quot;hornet&quot;.  The most  souped up jet in the Navy's inventory - until the arrival of a souped up  version of that plane tentativelt called the &quot;super hornet&quot; - the  Hornet was designed to handle a variety roles once filled by several planes  - interception, dogfight, and a number of distinct strike roles.  To  compensate for the workload, the Hornet's controls are computer augmented -  the pilot's commands go through a computer that actually controls the  plane.  The potential for flying virtually any type of mission insures that  training will be expansive, and the lack of attentiob given undergraduate  flight training in any service means that &quot;Bogeys and Bandits&quot;  won't read like any book you've ever read about military  aviation.<br />Unfortunately, Gandt's monopolization of a subject doesn't cure  some flaws in the book - some admittedly impossible to avoid.  Gandt's  class of trainees covers the gamut - two whiz kids who chose naval aviation  when they couldn't get into nuclear subs; two women - one of whom adjusts  better than the other to training; an aging marine with unremarkable but  dependable flying qualities, who's only recently transitioned from  helicopters; and &quot;Highway&quot;, an African American pilot meant to  inspire memories of the &quot;Tuskeegee Airmen&quot; of WWII.  None of  these ever dominates the book, but going between them does little to make  them the flesh-and-blood people that their flaws.  Gandt's treatment needs  fleshing, but failing to do so, it only sounds fake and syruppy - like the  trainee who gets killed while his family is visiting the base, or Highway's  return home in an F-18 at the book's conclusion.  Highway's return is meant  to vindicate those who helped him as a child - a repayment of a debt, but  that's pat and conclusory, and shows the mis-focus of the book.  Training  to fly anything isn't about conclusions like a made-for-TV-movie; it's  about proving your ready for the next step and the step after that.  As in  &quot;Top Gun&quot;, the inhabitants of &quot;Bogeys and Bandits&quot; seem  to have no inkling that they are becoming warriors, and not just the  drivers of 600 MPH Porsches.  Unfortunately, Gandt offers no inkling of  this either, and once a trainee is brought up to highlight a particularly  difficult segment of training (like flying treetop level at 400 MPH, or  carrier-landings), it's back on the backburner.  <br />Some treatment just  makes me wince, as when one of Gandt's female charachters, declining in  performance, lashes back with allegations of chauvanism.  Gandt's respinse  - not found in any dialog from his trainees is along the lines of - oh no,  not more of that.  Without any substance lent to allegations of sexism in  the wake of tailhook, Gandt sounds patronizing and condescending.  The  crash of F-14 driver Kara Hultgreen, ultimately blamed on pilot error,  underlines that women are being rushed into service to satisfy political  correctness, and the satisfactory performance of the class' other female  trainee suggests (not conclusively however) that sexism is not a factor.   But Gandt's femaile pilots remain one-dimensional, one to cry foul, the  other to negate allegations of sexism.<br />The title refers to two types of  flying targets - Bogeys being unknowns, possibly friendly or hostile;  Bandits are definately dangerous - meant to symbolize the transition of the  trainees from unknown quantities to proven fighter-pilots.  But Bogyes they  remain.	2000-08-23

When airplanes try landing on aircraft carriers, they have to grab at a high-tension wire stretched across the carrier's deck with a heavy metal  arrestor hook.  If the pilot doesn't make the descent properly, the hook  skims the wire and the plane sails off the deck, hopefully able to make  another try.<br />&quot;Feet Wet&quot;, the memoirs of Admiral Gilchrist -  whose career began in WWII era hellcats and ended with F-14's - is a bit of  a bolter itself, never really getting into the meat of his subject.   Covering the Admiral's entire career, it never really comes together as  more than a sum of anecdotes (but fascinating ones) that begin in the early  1950's and stretch to the Reagan years.  Early in the book, the author  explains that he won't make judgements about the war in Vietnam, but he  doesn't really say much - it's as if the war were some evolutionary  outgrowth of naval aviation that just sort of happened.  There's no  histroic context at all.  Gilchrist's perspective is further harmed because  he can't monopolize it - like most military memoirs, it's filled with  stories of other people (like the F-8 pilot whose full-proof system of  carrier landings was fatally flawed; or the Cougar driver who accidentally  landed on the wrong aircraft carrier - luckily it was still American, or  the F-8 pilot who ejected from his F-8 after it had fallen off the carrier  deck and sunk! )  Worse, Gilchrist's narrative of his own experiences seem  too gung-ho to reconcile with that of any pilot who has to land a 20-ton  jet on rolling carrier deck in the middle of the night.  Other narratives  (like those in &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; freely speak of hardened and  experienced pilots who turn in their wings after an experience like that.   Gilchrist, an experienced pilot, seems ever the solid professional - he  most probably was, but even the absence of question of fear robs the memoir  of its bite.  what's left is mostly pat and unsatisfying.  The author  doesn't even bother to flesh out his aircraft or the experience of flying  them, and John Trotti's &quot;Phantom over Vietnam&quot; remains king of  the air in that respect.  Why was the F-8 such a legendary fighter?  We  don't find out here.  When the author moves up to a new airplane, which he  does very often given the length of his career, he gives a short paragraph  devoted to the plane's vital stats - and that's about all.  What sums up  the book is a famous quote of churchill's - never, never, never give up:  the refrain repeated by every carrier aviator convinced that he will never  be able to land his airplane on the carrier deck.  unfortunately,  &quot;Feet Wet&quot; gives up too quickly.	2000-08-23

Clarence Anderson's memoirs of the war ... fighter pilotswere normal guys with their own rivalries and an air of cluelessness that seems unusual for post-modern &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; perspectives but seemed fresh when I read it in 1991.  Coming from the subject of &quot;To Fly and Fight' it's still refreshing.  Anderson was barely out of his teens when the war broke out and he joined the Army Air Force, precursor to the modern (and separate) USAF.  Sent to England, Anderson was assigned to fly P-51 Mustangs, one of the most capable fighters, and witnessed the hopelessness of the allied daylight bombing strategy. After the war, Anderson flew flight test out of Edwards, breeding ground for the first generation of supersonic military aircraft, but spent most time at a desk.  During Vietnam, Anderson rose to command a squadron fighter bombers flying out of Thailand.  Through it all he comes off as something other than what I expected out of a fighter pilot - the sort of every guy that propaganda would have tried to create but never did.  In WWII, Anderson saves the lives of bomber crews, enages in mortal combat with enemy fighters and sometimes makes the decision not to fir ... Anderson avoids the morbid fascination with the lives affected by combat - what happened to the bomber crews or wingmen that owed him his life, or the fighter pilots he may have killed.  <br />Unlike Yeager, Anderson's tenure at flight test was not so glamorous.  Instead of the sonic barrier, Anderson's experience included the &quot;parasite-fighter&quot;, a fatally flawed idea for linking dimunitive fighters to larger motherships like the B-36 and typical of the &quot;anything goes&quot; atmosphere bred by cold-war demands and postwar prosperity. In that era, even General Curtis Le May knew the project was crazy, that it would never work, but that somebody would just have to try it anyway.  When the tests result in tragedy, Anderson doesn't fail to include himself as deserving blame. <br />Anderson goes to command a Fighter Wing in Thailand flying missions nto Vietnam.  Although Anderson gives the war litle treatment, he doesn't neglect his ignominous debut - barely in command when one of his new unit's F-105's makes an emergency, wheels-up landing.<br />Much of &quot;Fly' is anecdotal, but the anecdotes are priceless, ... <br />Most aviator memoirs stress that the man in cockpit is just a normal guy, but Anderson makes it convincing.

US	49374774	R2XDKKTIHSE2AZ	0446512028	636886513	The Gold Crew	Books	3	3	4	N	N	The new battle of the Atlantic	Most technothrillers seem like throwback to the cold war in their  portrayal of stalwart American servicemen (without a hint of any dissent)  and their problem-free hardware up against the fractured - almost medeival  - horde of the Warsaw pact military.  &quot;The Gold Crew&quot; in which  the crew of an American ballistic missile submarine comes apart and brings  the world to the brink of nuclear war, is a different anachronism - when we  thought we were losing the cold war and our pretensions of freedom were  being undermined by a dissent that argued against the costs of our  hostility to the Russians.<br />The title &quot;The Gold Crew&quot; refers to  the navy's system of having rotating crews on-board missile subs - the subs  can endure prolonged duty better than the men who run it; to ensure that a  submarine remains ready for sea (and for launching its missiles) for the  longest period, missile subs return for patrol only to switch crews - blue  crew for gold and vica versa.  The gold crew gets the lucky (or unlucky)  assignment of participating in an extended wargame involving a few missiles  with unarmed warheads.  The need for constant readiness requires that some  of the missiles remained tipped with armed warheads, but the gold crew is  the best and nobody imagines that the crew is particularly vulnerable to  stress.  In this case, it comes down to bad paint - fumes that put the men  off their axes and sufficiently diminish their ability to tell reality from  wargame inspired fantasy.  <br />I read &quot;The Gold crew&quot; about the  same time that &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; appeared - and &quot;Gold&quot;  seemed prefigured to destroy the myth of seamless, push-button  techno-warfare that Tom Clancy's books created, almost as soon as they were  really created.  Unfortunately, it takes more than bad technology to make  good charachters, and none in &quot;Gold&quot; really stand out.  Author  Scortia realized that the whole charachters of other bookswere too  unbeleivable, but failed to realize that even dissassembled chartachters  don't a compelling novel make.  Once bad paint fumes cause the crew to  become undone, and the captain has begun to convince them that war has  actually begun , the crew doesn't try to put itslef together.  There's  something frightening in the way that Scortia's crew moves with the  listless way of men who have actually seen WWIII, but he doesn't capitalize  on it enough.<br />Still a worthy effort - and better than the by-the-numbers  TV movie based on it (With Robert Conrad, David Soul and Sam Waterston)	2000-08-20
US	49374774	R3T43LZ1X1LMG4	051756601X	279602045	Soviet SST: The Techno-Politics Of The Tupolev-144	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Before the Concorde disaster	&quot;Soviet SST&quot; tells the more than the story of the ill-fated  Tu-144, the Russian designed supersonic transport.  Rather, it surveys the  development of civil air travel in Russia as well as the intellectual  hearts and minds behind Ruusian aerospace technology.  <br />The Tu-144 was  the product of an international race begun in the early 1960's to make  mach-2 flight safe and practical enough for civilian aviation.  By the end  of the decade, however, the race petered out, with Russia being the only  single country still harboring faster-than-sound dreams.  America had  backed out completely, while the Anglo-French effort (crossing  international borders) seemed to take the jingoistic fun out of it.  But  the Russians pressed on.  Their first prototype was impressive (on the  outside, anyway) and it flew by the end of the decade.  A full scale  development, bigger and less elegant, seemed to expose the crudity of the  Russian design For instance, Concorde's designers attacked the problem of  overheating with a cryogenic system using the plane's fuel to keep the  fuselage cool; The Russian answer seems less refined: large air  conditioners - spaced thruought the fuselage - kept the plane cool.  They  also added unneccessary weight, and filled the plane with noise.  What  really cllinched it was the Tu-144's demonstration at the Paris, in which  its slim hull split in flight like a toothpick or a pretzel stick.  The  disaster killed everybody on board, and a few parisians below.  A few  attempts at normal service also end in tragedy, and the plane was only  resurrected recently, and only as a testbed.<br />The book &quot;Tu-144&quot;  could have gone wrong for so many different reasons - whether gloating over  Soviet boasts of techno-supremacy, or as apologia for it, or as a dry,  neutral retelling of the Tu-144 story.  And as the story of any airplane is  intertwined with the stories of others, setting out the stucture of the  Russian SST itself is no small challenege.<br />Happily, Howard Moon's writing  - whether accurate or not - is cogent and compelling.  It's not dry  (especially when recounting the real Comrade Tupolev's efforts to design  airplanes while a prisoner in the Gulag), nor does it rush to judgement  about the plane's fate (the crack-up was caused by stress in turn resulting  from an abrupt maneuver to escape collision with a French Mirage fighter).   Neither does the author toss out technical jargon as if he were writing for  the Discovery Channel.  Mr. Moon knows his readers aren't savy  aerodynamicists, but he doesn't condescend to them either.  <br />This book  should get some attention now with the anticipated demise of the Concorde,  a plane that earns its owners less money than prestige.  The Tu-144 also  sought prestige and found no profit either.	2000-08-18

Though the commies are gone, author Smith replaces their  regime with something much more bleak - a self-imposed oppression bread by  horrific deprivation.  In Moscow, in the days leading up to the failed coup  of 1991, Muscovites pay three rubles for burnt-out bulbs (they can be  swapped at work for those that still work), and even homicide investigators  must warn their colleagues not to loot the homes of murder victims.  <br />The  brutal death of a seemingly petty banker, dragooned against his will into  cooperating with Moscow police, seems an unlikely starting point for a  great renko novel - unlike Polar Star.  Things speed up though when the  depth of the dark forces involved is guaged by now newly-rehabilitated  investigator Renko.  Permitted to return to Moscow from his exile in  &quot;Polar Star&quot;, Renko is in no hurry to please Moscow superiors,  but the banker's murder, with its links to the newly re-unified Germany  hint at Renko's lover and another possible re-unification.  Keeping in  charachter, it doesn't take long for Renko's investigations to cause those  surrounding him to wind up either dead or fed up with him.  Smith smoothly  weaves the corruption and chaos of the collapsing USSR into the ordered  machinations of the murderer, and no detail seems extraneous. (This is the  book where we learn that the Chechen capital of Grozny was named after Tsar  Ivan Grozny)  With allies either turning against him or turning up dead,  renko comes into his element and displays a rare inventiveness that's  supposed to symbolize that of the starving Russians.  Renko appears  impossibly grim and impoverished, yet smith makes it seem like the starving  detective - traveling from Moscow to Berlin - isn't about to wink at us.   OnlyRenko's unexpectedly painful reunion with his lover Irina seems to  crack him and prove the detective capable of surprise.  In the end, the  real mystery, Smith reminds us, is not how people are killed, but how they  live.  Some mysteries are better left semi-solved.	2000-08-18

The story of Victor Belenko, the Russian pilot who defected to the west at  the controls of a MiG-25 had fascinated me for years, but this story seems  unable to do credit to the ex-Russian flier, his powerful airplane or the  challenges that both faced in making the break to Japan.  <br />Before 1975,  the MiG-25 was rumored to be a super-plane, not only capable of  super-speeds, but also extremely agile.  it's engines, weapons and sensors  were rumored to match - if not surpass - anything in the west.  America's  stable of fighter jets, battle proven in the mideast - were originally  built with this MiG in mind.  Belenko's defection, giving the west its  first look at the plane, shattered all illusions.  The MiG's high-tech  sensors worked on vacuum tubes; its weapons were bulky and balky; and its  ominously engines - thought to be adavcned turbofans - were just very large  turbojets.  Even the rumored speed limit of Mach-3 had to be taken with a  grain of salt, with such dashes severely reducing the longetivity of the  airplane, and utterly destroying the engines.<br />Bad planes can make good  reading - one of my favorite books is &quot;The World's Worst  Airplanes&quot; - but Barron doesn't give the MiG its due.  Once he exposes  the MiG for what it is, he balances - vacuum tubes aren't entirely  obsolescent, and turbofans wouldn't have worked at high mach speeds anyway  - but never gives the reader the impression of what it's like to fly or  even sit one of those monsters.  The MiG is one of the largest fighters in  the world, certainly a challenge for its pilots, but Barron never makes his  MiG any more real than the one that scared the military into developing new  planes and missiles against it.  Once Barron gets the MiG into Japan, he  gives it the same treatment the CIA did - a good but brief look before  being crated for home.<br />But &quot;MiG Pilot&quot; is also the story of  Belenko, child of a hard life in a none-to-pleasant Soviet corner.  The  Soviets remain an engima to Barron.  This book doesn't hide its contempt  for the Soviets (Barron also wrote about the Walker Family Spy ring), but  the author's antipathy is masked.  He doesn't try to hide the monumental  deprivations ordinary Russians face as much as he hides their realization  of it.  Much of Barron's Russia reminded me of the scenes of medeival  Russia in &quot;Peter Nevsky&quot;, and it's hard to beleive that a nation  of such remote expanses could have produced a machine like the MiG-25 in  either its imagined or actual forms.  Belenko's development as a pilot,  then a fighter pilot and finally ascending to the MiG-25 itself, as well as  a similar evolution for the MiG-25, are not to be found here, and its a  grievous ommission.<br />Once Belenko is in America, the impact of leaders'  oppressions results in an enormous culture shock, as if no borders contain  the reach of the police state.  He is overwhelmed by the degree of  diversity in America, political, ethnic and social.  It's hard to believe  that Russia was as entirely homogenous as Belenko's experience in America  would suggest.  Even if it's true, this part of the book is also the  weakest, sounding less like a technothriller than an episode of &quot;What  a Country.&quot;  A fuller, though not perfect perspective on Soviet  oppressions and the makings of a Red Air Force pilot can be found in  &quot;Fulcrum&quot;, the story of Akex Zuyev who defected to the west in  1989 under circumstances not unlike those of Belenko.	2000-08-18
US	49374774	R2OD0NV3YOKB5I	0345402871	687781903	Airframe	Books	1	6	10	N	N	bleeds energy!	With &quot;air-rage&quot; on the rise, novels about air catastropes will always be topical.  Topical books are usually meant to sell themselves and  &quot;Airframe&quot; - with its flat charachters, by-the-numbers plot and  paper-thin moralizing - offers nothing but slim reading waiting for a  headline for back-up.<br />The titular fuselage belongs to the N-22, an  airliner designed by Norton Aerospace, one of those bland and vague  corporate entities typical to Michael Crichton novels.  N-22 jets are known  for their safety, especially in America - though this might have more to do  with the fact that much of the N-22's competition is European.   Aero-chauvinism vanishes when a US-bound N-22 encounters inexplicably  severe turbulence, and a conspiracy of media, lawyers and assorted,  uncredited &quot;experts&quot; descend on Norton like vultures.   &quot;Airframe&quot; could have been a dramatic vehicle to explore such  issues as corporate accountability, gov't regulation of industry, products  liability, and the media, but Crichton never gets anywhere near that  destination.  The Norton Aero experts are his heroes, protecting the  corporate world from the scum of special interests.  Crichton saddles them  without a shred of self-doubt in the quality of their product, thus  removing what would have been a rich source of dramatic and moral tension.   The enemy (bottom-feeding lawyers, self-proclaimed experts and the amoral  media types that give the other two their voice) are not only undeniably  amoral and dim, but ugly.  We almost see the warts.  <br />Having created a  force with no chance of reader sympathy, Crichton seems to rail against  media manipulation of commerical flight, but it all sounds hollow.  Much is  made of the DC-10 which was grounded temporarily following a string of  disasters in 1979.  Though the DC-10 was eventually cleared to fly,  Crichton insists that McDonnell never sold another.  I'm suspicious because  a) living near an airport, I usedto see plenty of DC-10's until recently  when they were phased out - nearly two decades after the grounding and  about the same time as the DC-10's competitor, the L-1011; b) DC-10's  market misfortunes (if they existed) would have occurred when airline  deregulation created dozens of new airlines flying short routes with small  planes.  The small 737, once a niche aircraft, is now commercial aviation's  most popular jet, typifying market erosion for all big planes.  Figures  show the DC-10, for its perceived faults, outsold its competition, the  L-1011; and c) if the DC-10's misfortunes resulted from public mistrust in  its construction or design, lack of confidence should have spread to all  McDonnel planes.  Instead, McDonnell continued selling planes and did well  enough with smaller planes like the MD-80 to try their hand at a  next-generation airliner, the  MD-11.  Crichton mentions the DC-10 like a  mantra, so pat and without a sound of dissent, it's almost impossible to  take at face value.  <br />Like a badly damaged jetfighter,  &quot;Airframe&quot; bleeds energy quickly once its apparent that the  author has less interest in aviation than the media's sway over America.   In fact, the book is so divorced from its high-flying mascot, that it could  have been written about any product - like toys or appliances.  In that  respect, &quot;Airframe' recalls the little-seen &quot;Missile Lords&quot;  (Sutton, 1963), a novel about the high-stakes world of ICBM's, and the  companies that build them.  So focused on the corporate and marketing minds  behind the fictitious ICBM, that the missile itself and its explosive power  are never fully realized and the company might as well have been trying to  sell the air force some mopeds.  &quot;Aiframe&quot; could also have been  written about Mopeds until media attention over TWA 800 required adding  some chapters and judiciously use find/replace to swap mopeds for  airliners.  Though Crichton seems to fight this with some thin prose  praising the autonomy of the plane makers, it's thin.  This is especially  because &quot;Airframe&quot;'s heroes are almost as divorced from aviation  as the N-22's enemies.  Though extolling the pilots, none of the book's  main charachters are airline pilots, and the band of N-22 partisans who  know anything about airplanes exist only to cry fowl at the media and  demonstrate the stupidity of those without the author's sense of flight.   This is not Craig Thomas' &quot;A Different War&quot;, where the hero  redeems the suspected airliner by flying it.  The flight in one simple  chapter of that book is enough to banish the mopeds.  Crichton's attentions  on airliners, in contrast, is no different from that of the dim laymen he  populates his books with - as vehicles.  <br />To remind readers - and perhaps  himself - that his book is about something expensive and exotic, but beyond  his grasp to put in its element, Crichton tosses in his usual suspects -  corporate intrigue:  darker forces are at work here, as evidenced here by  Bob Richman, the plucky heroine's unwanted intern.  Richman is dead-meat  the minute (or page) he appears.  His blue-chip upbringing, top-flight  education, high-priced (and foreign! ) car and his youth are enough to  raise warning flags.  At times, I thought Crichton was on the verge of a  surprise that would not only redeem the sleazy ivy-leaguer but confound his  readers as well, primed for the brat's fall.  Alas, &quot;Airframe&quot;  remains blatantly obvious (the brat's name is the perfect example - I guess  &quot;Richboy&quot; would have been too obvious), as averse to turbulence  as a well designed airliner.  Alas again that Crichton, while heaping scorn  on the media fails to realize that his corporate cloak&amp;dagger  undermines his bloated polemic - the media's hatchet job would never have  progressed without help from Norton's inside enemies.  But that patent flaw  in Crichton's argument probably made sense when the book was about mopeds.   If you've got to read Crichton, read the first Jurassic, the Andromeda  Strain or Sphere.  If you've got to read about flying, pick up Coonts or  Craig Thomas.  Keep this airframe grounded.	2000-08-17

In 1964, after achieving domination over all but the United States, excluding parts of eastern europe that remain obstinate, the Thousand-Year  Reich prepares to celebrate Der Fuhrer's 75th birthday.  But it's business  as usual for SS Detective Xavier March, as Deighton would say.  In the  short-hand traditional for publishers, March investigates a suspicious  death seemingly unconnected with the fact that in 1964, Deutch Uber Alles  is the rule.  But March, who once drove U-Boats for the Kriegsmarine, is a  hunter by habit, and refuses subtle (and not so) hints to dismiss any  suspicions.  While a patriot, March's hunter's instinct foster suspicions  that remain, much as he had been in the war, slighlty submerged -  suspicions over the fate of Germany's Jews, the seeming perpetual  resistance to German rule in the occupied and distant East and the wealth  of data on human morbidity provided by experimentation on political  prisoners in concentration camps.  Estranged from his wife and son, March  is in no mood to file things away.  With the help of a visiting journalist  (a beautiful and plucky American, ofcourse), March's investigation takes  him to darkened archives and the offices of high ranking Nazis very much  alive in a fully drawn and frighfully convicing world.   <br />&quot;Fatherland&quot; excels not only because of what it does, but what  it doesn't.  The author resists the temptation to create the post-war Nazi  hegemony by detailing its conquests with anything more than subtle clues  (V-3 missiles launched at NY keep America out of the war; U-Boats are now  nuclear powered, hinting at German nuclear achievements parralleing  America's; the complicity of non-concquered governments like those of  President Joseph Kennedy, happy to lay blame for genocide firmly on the  wartime Soviet regime).  The biggest twist is that while established  history remains a mystery, the mystery on March's agenda quickly becomes no  mystery at all: the corpse (ironically identified as a founding father when  his sole criminal record arises from a 1922 arrest in a beer hall in  Munich) is found outside a converted schoolhouse on the Wansee.  When the  dead man's connection to that location stems from a meeting there of  high-ranking nazi's in early 1942, historically adept readers will realize  that an even more monumental crime - the crime of the century - is  involved.  March remains appropriately dim, creating one of the finest  examples of deductive police work through investigation - Harris refuses to  allow the slightest intrusion of our history into his hero's thinking.   Instead, March tracks down the other famed Nazis who met suspicious ends  and follows a trail that leads him to a Swiss bank.  I'm not sure whether  current attention to war-time mangement of Swiss banks was around when  &quot;Fatherland&quot; debuted, in either case, Harris' treatment seems  ironic, if not prescient - the accounts weren't left behind by jews and  other Nazi victims, but by disloyal Germans possessed by the insane fear  that (huh! ) Germany might lose the war.<br />Harris also avoids the urge to  recreate the dark gods of the Reich and name drop (Goering, Goebbels,  Himmler and most of the Discovery Channel's usual suspects are long gone.)   Albert Speer doesn't appear, but the author's drawing of undivided Berlin -  monumental and insecure - gives the architect more charachter than a few  lines of dumb dialog.  Heydrich appears, but only to add more mystery -  it's never clear if his aid to March masks fear of joining the other  mysteriously dead Nazis, or a subtle warning to drop the case.  (Does  anybody really want to get a career boost from a former SS Intelligence  Chief?)  <br />Best of all are the people who populate the vibrant  Thousand-year Reich.  No revisionist or apologist, Harris nevertheless  seems to object to any simplified answer holding all war-times Germans  culpable for the holocaust - his Germans seem not slightly cowedby fear of  their regime yet honestly ignorant of their victims' fate.  While a U-Boat  ace in 1943, March unknowingly kept warm against the bitter North Atlantic  in socks sewn with hair from dead Jews.  In the 1990's, we're kept warm  with our own complacency on history, and its immutability.  Harris is  telling us otherwise - wake up!	2000-08-16

Actually, reluctant inaction is more like it. A hero, with a row of medals to prove it, Richardson works tirelessly to return to sea. Marrying his sweetheart (ex-fiance of Jim Bledsoe, Richardson's rival killed in \\"Run Silent\\") and becoming a father has taken the sailor out of Richardson. After WWII, however, going to back to work means joining the most exclusive of the nation's services - the \\"Nuclear Navy\\". With a charachter - more than loosely based on Admiral Rickover - holding the keys to the nuclear navy, Richardson's combat history is more a liability than an asset, fixing Beach's hero firmly in the past, and not the atomic future. None of Richardson's training or experience prepares him for the cold-war intrigues that envelop him once he reports aboard his first SSN. while suspenseful and (likely) realistic, Richardson's depcition of submarine warfare seems little changed from that used to drive \\"Run Silent\\" and its sequel \\"Dust on the Sea\\", even though both were set in the pre-nuclear age, when subs spent most of their time on the surface, and the deeps seemed almost as mysterious to the subs as the were to the surface ships. Little of the silent claustrophobia of submarine-warfare comes across, and the scenes pf Richardson at work seem more reminescent of some cheesy WWII sub-thriller. As in previous Beach/Richardson novels, dialog drives the action. When charachters talk, it's often in long paragraphs that make the listeners seem like servile plebes.	2000-08-14

The heroic explorers of &quot;Red Deer, White Deer&quot;  look past their prejudices against the brutal ape creatures of a newly  discovered planet, to find the kernel of humanity - with all of its  qualities and failings.  The protagonist of &quot;Can I Speak to Nina&quot;  is something of a child frozen in the body of an adult - emotionally  paralyzed by his clumsy loss of a ration card during WWII.  Not entirely  willing to forgive himself the mistake which made life much less pleasant  in an unpleasant time (the rest of the family had to give up some of their  rations), he never comes alive until accidentally calling a young girl  who's literally more backward than he - eerily convinced that the year is  not 1972, but 1943!  The oddities of the universe, which cover up the  unoriginality of plots or flatness of charachters in other sc-fi, cause  Bulychev's charachters to unfold like a flower.

US	49374774	R213INKY5Y07ZW	0515127485	926822340	Archangel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The other Fatherland	Der Fuhrer is too horrible to be seen face-to-face in Harriss' debut novel &quot;Fatherland&quot;, and was only referred to by radio announcers.  In  &quot;Archangel&quot;, Harriss stokes the same idea from a different  perspective - obsession with the 20th century's other monster, the evil  Joseph Stalin.  As in &quot;Fatherland&quot; and &quot;Enigma&quot; (the  latter of the two is a great read when you consider it as a possible  prequel to the former), the unlikely hero is something of a detective - in  this case an historian.  But Harriss refuses to succumb to the  &quot;snobbery of chronology&quot; by which history is simply dismissed as  anything more important than an explanation for how we are today.  In  Harriss world, the past has a habit of finding its way back to the present  - whether it's the proof of genocide (Fatherland) or Soviet-backed  massacres (Enigma), nothing is ever consigned to history without a chance  to rear its head and spoil our ordered world.  In &quot;Archangel&quot;,  the past is Stalin and his reign of terror.  Post-Soviet Russia yearns for  direction and a clique of ex-Soviet generals and politicians remain  permanantly on the verge of returning the nation to soviet rule.  Even the  structures arranged by the Yeltsin government to create democracy have the  seeds of autocracy, and those who seek to prevent the rebirth of the KGB  may actually be following in its footsteps.  But it's business as usual for  the westerners who exploit Russia's resources and its potential for a  market.  The hero-historian, lead on to believe that the official story of  &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; may be incomplete, looks deeper into records and  finds that the dead dictator's legacy may yet be unrealized.  Helped -  sometimes pushed - by an American TV journalist and by the daughter of a  Stalinist security guard, the hero rtacks down the ephemeral clues -  stories and other conspiracy theories - for the hard evidence: a journal  pried out of Stalin's desk by Beria.  But even that prize isn't enough, and  the heroes head out to Archangel, the irradiated northern frontier of  Russia, where they confront, not only the truth, but their powerlessness  against it and (gasp) their own complicity in its realization.  &quot;Archangel&quot; arguably surpasses previous novels - though Harriss  has yet to draw a world as fully realized as post-war Berlin of  &quot;Fatherland&quot; - in that the story is built on the experiences of  flawed and credible charachters.  In any novel built on old stories told to  the main charachters, there is always the plot-weakness that the stories  may be completely fake.

But even that prize isn't enough, and  the heroes head out to Archangel, the irradiated northern frontier of  Russia, where they confront, not only the truth, but their powerlessness  against it and (gasp) their own complicity in its realization.   &quot;Archangel&quot; arguably surpasses previous novels - though Harriss  has yet to draw a world as fully realized as post-war Berlin of  &quot;Fatherland&quot; - in that the story is built on the experiences of  flawed and credible charachters.  In any novel built on old stories told to  the main charachters, there is always the plot-weakness that the stories  may be completely fake.

Skate	Books	2	1	1	N	N	I thought this was the &quot;Silent Service&quot;	People who hate technothrillers usually fault them for being mechanical, but &quot;Final Voyage of the SSN Skate&quot; proves that the opposite  extreme is just as bad.  Basically the story of how the oldest surviving  USN nuclear attack sub is used to aid in the defection of a top red Navy  admiral with the crucial component of a horrifying new weapon,  &quot;Skate&quot; is one of the most annoying technothrillers I've read  because it refuses to be streamlined, and the author continually throws out  basic details without actually telling a story.  More than the story of the  titular sub's last dive, &quot;Skate&quot; tells the story of the daring  spy and the cloak and dagger puzzles the spy must assemble to satisfy the  defecting red admiral.  Then, there is the feared Soviet super-weapon, a  particle beam (Russian superweapons were the rage in the late 1980's when  &quot;Skate&quot; debuted, as indicated by &quot;Cardinal of the  Kremlin&quot;, &quot;Flight of the Old Dog&quot; and  &quot;Winterhawk&quot;) that will end western supremacy (if not  civilization itself).  Thrown into the mix is the SSN Skate itself - and  Author Cassell just throws, rather than arranges these into a plot,  regardless of the relative importance of each detail.  When the American  Admiral lays out the existence of the Russian weapon, now installed on a  Russian aircraft carrier, he almost sounds as if he's racing the author -  racing to get his explanation out before the author tosses another plot  complication.  No details, ofcourse, are the product of intuition or  deductive reasoning of intelligent charachters with independent  perspectives, but revealed by blabby and boasting charachters who would  sooner shoot themselves than keep their mouths shut.  When an allied spy is  revealed a Soviet plant - you guessed, when he blabs the truth out - I kept  yelling at the hero &quot;shoot him now, before he finishes his story - he  can't shoot and spill the beans at the same time!&quot;Even the star, the  SSN Skate itself, suffers this confusion, replacing the usual stars of  contemporary submarine technothrillers (Los Angeles class subs) with a  broken-down, 1st generation sub that couldn't be any less a menace to the  Red Navy if we sold it to the Russians.  The techno and dramatic  possibilities of the creaking sub and its misfit crew are enormous in  reverse proportion to the sub's capabilities.  But Cassell will have little  of it and, after the minimal treatment necessary to explain why the Navy  needs as unreliable a platform as the USS Skate, leaves both sub and crew  in the background.  In fact, because no elements of the story really rise  to take the novel's focus, the book is entirely background noise, lost as  each charachter is trying to tell his side of the story.  A pity, the plot  was actually compelling, and &quot;Skate&quot; looks like an earlier  version the author forced himself to put down, before forgetting to arrange  it all in ways that would create tension and identification with his  charachters.	2000-08-13

This is because &quot;Final Approach&quot; is simply an example of  the sort of thrillers to be churned out in the information age, where the  heroes and villains are just bureaucrats.  By the time we've finished  &quot;Final Approach&quot;, flying remains an experience as alien as when  the book opens, but now we've become smarter in the bureaucratci workings  of the FAA and NTSB among others, not to mention that the government hides  information (huh? ) and that the media will exploit stories for their  ratings value rather than invetsigate them (no way! ).  Even as a  bureaucratic-mystery, &quot;Final Approach&quot; fails.  Though the heroes  are meant to represent the most efficient resources the government can use  to prove the cause of the fatal crash, the solution is not revealed by  intelligent ivestigators and dogged investigation, but because somebody  just gives up and blabs the truth.  The conspiracy theories and hysteria by  which the author condescends to non-experts (The media is bad for feeding  us stories it can't really stand by, and we're bad for accepting it so  easily) make it convenient for his protagonists to look busy, even as they  remain oblivious to the truth.  Anybody could have solved this mystery.	2000-08-13

Even subs not armed with city-smashing ICBM's were purpose-built for WWIII:  whether for subs armed with the cruise-missiles that preceded the age of  ICBM armed subs, or when those subs took to sea, to hunt down those of the  enemy while running interference with our own.  Sontag &amp; Drew paint a  picture of a submarine war that was anything but stalled by mutual  deterrence, detailing the submarine as an active agent of another kind:  espionage.  From the end of WWII until today, subs relied on an ever  increasing array of surveillance equipment and the tenacity of their crews  to extract intelligence coups ranging from secret communications links of  the Soviet leadership to identifying the unique sonar charachteristics of  Russian subs.  <br />&quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot; is intriguing reading, a  page turner, impossible to put down and left me wanting more.   <br />Unfortunately, that's also the book's weakness, and a history of an  intelligence war that lasted for about half-a-century seems startingly  incomplete.  &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot; recalls Wolfe's &quot;The Right  Stuff&quot;, the history of US Aerospace from cracking the &quot;sound  barrier&quot; to the last Mercury flight.  Wolfe would've gone to the Lunar  landings, but thought a 1000 pages a bit long.  Like &quot;Stuff&quot;,  &quot;Bluff' contains enough material for several books, but contents  itself with 514 pages.  Unlike the development of space-travel, bracketed  by Chuck yeager and Apollo, the obvious milestones of submarine technology  (nuclear power and the torpedo-shaped submarine hull) fall midway, while  other historic points (loss and discovery of the USS Scorpion and the CIA's  semi-successful efforts to raise a sunken Russian sub) seem anti-climactic.   Between these historic points, there are many good stories (some that I'venever heard of, others that are old, but seem better treated here) that  nevertheless remain insufficiently connected by a well-defined theme or by  historically recurring charachters as Wolfe had in &quot;Stuff&quot;.   Figures like Sergey Gorshkov (The Soviet Navy's widely aknowledged  architect), Hyman Rickover (the so-called &quot;Father of the Nuclear  Navy&quot;) and John Craven recur thruought the book, but the author's  don't adequately account for how these men or others account for the makeup  and mission of today's navy.  Instead, the details and people of the  stories recounted in &quot;Bluff&quot; seem to go little farther than their  own stories - like the troubled history of the Mk 37 Torpedo - it appears  only as a possible explanation for the loss of the USS Scorpion.   Similarly, the hurried and incomplete planning that sent Scorpion to sea at  a time when overhauls were needed - exacerbating unsafe conditions thought  endemic to Russian ships but unknown in our Navy - are unconnected to  historic trends showing improved or decreased reliance on equipment,  training, morale or logistics.   Most glaring of all, the story seems to  half-told in excluding the Russian side.  While &quot;Bluff&quot; seems to  tell the story of submarine espionage, it's not clear if the Americans were  unique in using subs for spying or if the Soviets, who had the biggest  nuclear powered fleet in the world, are still holding their secrets.   Sontag and Drew hint at the offensive strategies of the Red Navy but never  rule out whether Russian subs had attempted to match the  intelligence-gathering efforts of the USN, or how successful they were.   Russian sources are used, not to create an hypothesis of Soviet military  tactics as much as to clarify what Americans know or did not - like the  loss of an ICBM sub in 1986 or the near-loss of a cruise-missile sub after  a collision with the attack sub, USS Tautog, or the suspicions held by Red  Admirals following the loss of a missile-carrier in the Pacific in 1968.   Sontag and Drew not only neglect to fully explore Soviet sub strategy  thruought the cold war but fail to note it as an issue either.  While  America is the aknowledged cold-war victor, if Russian submarine history is  as truly opaqe as &quot;Bluff&quot; allows, then it is the Russians who  merit the accolades.  As in WWII, the ultimate measure of success in  submarine warfare is silence.	2000-08-13

Most authors of this genre of political thriller have trouble reconciling the epic heroism (good or bad) of religious fundamentalists in the former  Soviet Central Asia with the image of mobs of AK-47-armed men tossing video  tapes and foreign magazines into bonfires.  In &quot;The Devil's  Garden&quot;, set in the region's decaying and polluted oilfields, the  tables are turned and the ordered world familiar to us disintegrates under  the feet of unlucky Westerners.  Though author Peters has dabbled in  techno-thriller before (&quot;Red Army&quot; and &quot;War in the Year  2020&quot;), he has also practically created his own subgenre of non-techno  centered in and around the fringes of the foremer Soviet empire.  <br />&quot;Devil's Garden&quot; tells the story of a young American kidnapped  while working for a relief program in that troubled region.  Because  Peters' victim is the daughter of a US senator, consequences of the  kidnapping go far beyond local problems and feed a growing maelstrom that  threatens to destroy order already fragile with the collapse of the USSR.   Among the unlucky Yankees caught up in the chaos are the Islamic  fundamentalists who carry-out the kidnap, the local chieftains who can't be  sure what their own role in the kidanpping is, the American intelligence  officer sent to lead the rescue, his lover, her husband, the republic's  leaders ready to tear their oil-rich state to shreds and an army willing to  battle anybody to the death - if they can just learn how to shoot.  As a  good indicator of the managed chaos, our hero, the aforementioned  intelligence officer, tries to determine who would kidnap the senator's  daughter by trying to find who's responsible.  Bit with the fate of the  tiny asian republic's oil at stake, and the militant forces welling up in  the population, it's soon clear that nobody is responsible for anything.   Peters manages this chaos well.  something I appreciate through all of  Peters books is his resolutereluctance to point fingers and lay blame -  his charachters do that, but are compensated with well nuanced faults that  make their objectivity suspect.  The guerrillas are fearsome, but not the  murderous, callous warriors of god we've seen in other books (or on CNN for  that matter).  The region's warlords, despite sparking a war that threatens  to explode beyond their own borders, are just greedy and - in a masterful  anti-climax occurring when the factions meet - go at each other much as the  corporate directors in a hostile buy-out.  One wonders how the directors of  Time-Warner and Disney would have settled their cable-disputes if they had  to fight with guns and soldiers instead of lawyers, bloated stock prices  and otherwise empty content.  The biggest revelation is the hero himself,  who, despite being an expert on the region, is actually more lost than any  of his fellow Americans.  It's all chaotic, but Peters keeps the novel from  falling apart and the chaos only adds scale to a blighted country and those  who live there and are set on destroying it.	2000-08-11

In 1991, before Gillian Anderson became the unwitting pin-up of the UFO conspiracy, I picked this book up and it blew my mind.  In War Heaven,  Maloney's hero is asigned to compete in an extensive series of war games in  a secret gov't base located in - you guessed it - Nevada.  In a place  called &quot;Area-61&quot; (to this day, Area-51 still dosn't sound right),  a mammoth supercomputer manages every aspect of the simulation.   Unbeknownst to the hero, a cabal of scientists and generals (when can these  two ever gather w/o being a &quot;cabal&quot;?) is using the supercomputer  for their own experiments on flying saucer debris recovered from places  called &quot;Roswell&quot; and &quot;Kecksburg&quot; which I never heard of  until reading this book.  The plot is actually quite spare and disjointed,  and Maloney's hero really has nothing to do with the UFO conspiracy as much  as saving his girlfriend from it.  Nevertheless, Maloney avoids simple  solutions to his conspiracy theory and the theorists, and the explanation -  which would be a dissappointment in other books - is actually a lot of fun  here.  In one of the best parts of the book, the Hero's girlfriend is  treated to a tour of Area-61's museum, a sort of Ripley's Believe It Or  Not, containing the usual suspects (Yeti's, not-so-dead presidents, and a  Japanese snow-monkey caught in the act of inventing fire).  One would wish  that the story of War Heaven, the simulation and War Heaven the UFO  conspiracy tract had any closer link than a few common charachters and  locations.  Also, I get the feeling that Maloney didn't really take his own  work seriously.  Not that he has to buy into the UFO subculture (and if he  did, there's nothing wrong with that) only that War Heaven is a great story  and I would have had a lot more fun with it if the author had done the  same.  The wargames part of the book actually offers up some fun  possibilities.  Since nobody dies (actually, in real life, there's always  the possibility of injury through accident), it reads like an episode of  the A-Team.  Watch the skies, Fool!	2000-08-09

Fans of WWII submairne lore may recall the story of the Shinano, the  Japanese super carrier sunk by a brace of merely six American torpedoes.   Desperate to get their carrier to sea, the Japanese failed to make the ship  sea-worthy, and an attack that couldn't have crippled the ship, instead  found one already full of holes.  &quot;Nimitz Class&quot;, the  technothriller in which one of America's mammoth super carriers is reduced  to radioactive dust on the sea, looks like swiss cheese next to the  ill-fated Shinano.  Though publicly blaming the incident on a catastrophic  reactor failure, a team of USN experts of astoundingly dubious ethic  homogeneity quickly settle on nuclear terrorism.  Though the signs point to  a rogue diesel sub helmed by a master submariner, how the attackers managed  to slip past carrier defenses that were trained to hunt them down is never  satisfactorily explained.  Instead, author Robinson hides behind the usual  technothriller devices - hints at Hussein and mideast terrorists (though I  had to go back to the novel to remind myslef which of Iran or Iraq  ultimately gets the blame), rogue Russians, a brilliant lone-wolf USN  nuclear expert, tough talking American brass (who are so uniformly white  and male, they make the cast of &quot;Midway&quot; look positively  multi-cultural) and a blizzard of details of dubious accuracy and even less  dramatic value.  More than any technothriller I can remember, &quot;Nimitz  Class&quot; seems in awe of its perceived ability to create a plot built on  the author's seeming mastery of details.  The first few pages are a prime  example, as the author draws life aboard the doomed carrier, filled with an  eye towards the nuts and bolts of its operation and filled with laughably  shallow versions of its crew.  That the author fails miserably at this,  when others have succeeded seems laughable when, only a few pages later,  the rogue sub strikes and cardbord carrier and it's cartoon crew is no  more.  <br/>What the author's technobabble does a better job of is covering  up how unsure the author was about his own story.  Whodunit?  Robinson hits  on the usual suspects, and I needed die@usa.com's review to remind me who  ultimately gets the blame.  The author crafts a complex web to explain how  the perps got paid, but that seems unneccesarily convoluted.  Robinson hits  on an intriguing idea, one involving rogue Israelis (yeah, they've got  subs) but, not waiting to develop the idea or its charachters, Robinson  twists the idea again, and pretty soon, I stopped caring who paid for the  job.  By the end, having already suspended our belief, Robinson adds the  final cheat: there is no climactic battle between the rogue sub and the  hero - or any other developed charachter.  Instead, in a major  miscalculation, Robinson hinges the story on his hero's ability to match  the rogue submariner's seemingly impossible feat of transiting from  Russia's Black Sea HQ, through the Bhosporous and into the Med - submerged.   Only  seeing proof that this feat is possible will convince the US  President to spend the billions needed to hunt the rogue sub down;  one  would think that the lost carrier was enough proof (they'd have to spend  billions to fix the reactors and weapons of the other ships if the  sub-story were not true and poor weapons really were to blame, and aren't  subhunters at sea supposedly looking for hostile subs anyway?) Once the  hero accomplishes this, other subs take to the sea to hunt the rogue down -  and the success is bleakly unsatisfying.  Some kind of submarine dogfight,  though the predictable resolution, would have required a greater feel for  the dynamics of submarine warfare than the author displays, and would have  likely forced the author to actually develop the mystery submariner  himself, who appears in no more than a few italicized lines throught the  novel.  want some submarine thrills, get &quot;Red October&quot;  &quot;Potemkin&quot; or anything by Poyer, or rent &quot;The Bedford  Incident&quot;, based on a superior novel in its own right.

Though &quot;Havan Bay&quot; takes place far from the cold and  inhospitable climes braved by intrepid investigator Arkady Renko in Martin  Cruz Smith's other Renko novels (&quot;Gorky Park&quot;, &quot;Polar  Star&quot; and &quot;Red Square&quot;), the famed and unloved Moscow  detective finds himslef feeling right at home - which is to say that nobody  wants him around.  Ostensibly in Cuba to identify the body of Renko's  one-time enemy and savior, KGB Col. Pribluda, Renko meets expatriate  Russians, exiled American hippies and a host of Cubans who endure their  island nation's gradual disintegration.  The body Pribluda, who saved  Renko's life after &quot;Gorky Park&quot;, is barely recognizable, but  nobody expects the visiting Moscow detective to challenge official Cuban  story that the washed up, disintegrated body is Pribluda's, or that the old  KGB officer's death was anything more than an accident.  Renko, all but  clinically depressed folowing the sudden death of his wife, is in no mood  to make friends or follow official decisions on anything.  Unlike previosu  novels, Renko has no official responsibility to find the truth, or any  ulterior motive to do so.  Unlike the situation in &quot;Polar Star&quot;,  set aboard a floating fish factory in the Glasnost days before the collapse  of the USSR, there is no hidden room where KGB officers control the  situation.  Nevertheless, Renko presses on.  The clues don't fit together  as neatly as they do in &quot;Polar Star&quot;, and the portrait of a  decayed Havana doesn't offer the reader as much as say the newly reunified  Germany of &quot;Red Square&quot; (for that matter, it doesn't offer much  to the Cubans either), but the plot never dips and Smith's prose never  cease to surprise.	2000-08-07

In &quot;The Gulf&quot;, Poyer brings back his nominal hero, Dan Lenson,  the unluckiest surviving officer in the USN.  Lenson went from the horrors  of an Arctic cruise, the loss of his ship and  full-blown inquiry in just a  single book! (the superlative &quot;The Circle&quot;).  In &quot;The  Gulf&quot;, Poyer tries to make Lenson share the focus of the novel with  other intriguiging charachters - a grizzled, but tireless helicopter crew;  aging UDT skin-divers; and a beautiful, but brilliant and tough female  diplomat who calls Washington's shots in the Persian gulf.  The notion of  sending a woman - no matter how experienced - to relate American policy in  the male-dominated Gulf region seems implausible, and once Poyer brings her  and Lenson together, with an unconvincing spontaneity that only tears away  her diplomat's shell, she's entirely spineless.  The other charachters  don't connect with Lenson, and Poyer doesn't bring together the story until  the novel is almost over.  The story revolves around American efforts to  enforce stability in the region without using more than enough gunboat  diplomacy to get the job done.  (too much will at least bankrupt  Washington, or perhaps trigger a confrontation with the Soviets).  For  Lenson, it means, again, facing a morally ambiguous figure in command - Ben  Shaker, the commanding officer of a Destroyer sent to the bottom by an  Iranian cruise missile.  Unfortunately, unlike other books, the  confrontation between Lenson and his obscure boss does not proceed as the  result of a sustained buildup, but pops up, almost like a cruise missile  itself.  To compensate, Poyer doesn't bring closure to the confrontation  immediately, but waits until the end of the story for a resolution.   Unfortunately, closure is too pat and unsatisfying.  The charachters go  there separate ways when the novel comes to an end, less like one of  Poyer's previous epics then some TV series based upon them.  A good read,  but unworthy of Poyer.	2000-08-06

Assuming a great plot, appealing  charachters and absorbing nautical scenes, the megalodon itself doesn't  manage to be scarier than any of today's sharks - who cares whether the  fish coming at you is 6 feet or sixty feet long?  Unconcerned, Alten just  keeps pumping out numbers, certain that meters or feet, rather than a  mouthful of teeth, will shock.  Actually, as Meg makes clear in the first  couple of pages, shocks aren't on the menu.  The prolog, occurring about 65  million years ago, pitting a T-rex against the mighty megalodon, is  supposed to rely on our memories of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and once the  shark wins, we're supposed to think that Meg has conquered that earlier  blockbuster as well.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work. Though T-rex is meant  to embody all that was mighty in terrestrial life in the age of the mighty  lizards, he might as well be a gila monster, as there are no people or even  minor mamals to give the lizard king any scale.  Alten, seized bythe power  of numbers, sets the whole thing according to measurements, even though  there won't be anybody around to set them, or even invent them for 65  million years. The battle with T-rex is the weakest scene in the book, but  the tension doesn't exactly shoot up from there.  The marine  biologist-hero, obsessed with Meg, is supposed to be sewized by a fear of  the meg, but he goes gamely after the monsters after...actually, I'm not  sure why he goes after the monster, or what he wants to do with it.  the  shark itself seems smarter than most of the humans in the book, knowing  just who to eat - the biologist's media-ambitious wife; her rich boyfriend;  and the crew of an American submarine who aren't going to let a few hundred  jurassic-era teeth beat American nuclear-know-how.  Everybody is  practically begging for a bite, but none of these paper-charachters seems  worthy of a guppy's attention.  Throw it back!	2000-08-06

For roughly a decade following the end of the war in Vietnam, cattle farmers of the southwest reported finding numerous steers dead and, apparently deliberately mutilated. Dead cows appeared to have body parts selectively and precisely removed in ways that suggested something other than feral scavengers. Blame for these incidents soon took a turn for the sinister, with sentiment hinting at the use of cattle carcasses for secret experiments by the government, sinister corporations, secret paramilitary organizations, aliens, devil worshippers or some weird combination involving all of them. <br />With no plan to turn up little green men out for a quick chorizo, Kagan and Summers find that the truth, even when plausible, can often chill more than fiction. In their journeys, they encounter the usual suspects - crackpots and the ambitious small-town media hounds that exploit them. While the authors wisely refrain from attempts to avoid explaining the phenomenon of cattle mutilation, Kagan and Summer also offer competent evidence suggesting that there was no phenomenon to explain - just overzealous reporting of typical and perfectly natural cases of bovine morality, combined with an unwillingness to recognize perfectly natural indicia of scavengers.  With no indication that the frequency of cattle deaths was actually within normal limits, slipshod reporting overlooked evidence that would have explained the indicia of mutilation. <br />I've since edited this review in-light of another review which doesn't do this book justice.  \\"Evidence\\" does not condescend towards the die-hard UFOlogists convinced of a link between aliens and the dead cows, nor attack the notion of intelligent extra terrestrials in general (or specifically the idea that ET's, for their advanced technology, would need to experiment on cows).K&S provide a wealth of alternative theories ruling out alien involvement, and never go out of their way to condemn as liars those who steadfastly claim otherwise.  Theories implicating corporations, the military, Satanists or simply those inspired to commit acts as copycats are inherently more plausible than UFO's.  That is not to say that K&S don't detail the subjectivity of those believing in the ET's, or reveal the paucity of their claims or their willingness to jump to UFO as the solution of first resort.  Neither does it mean that K&S must ignore how UFO enthusiasts like TV reporter Linda Moulton Howe play-up the alien-angle from both sides - as fervent proponents of a theory as well as seemingly impartial reporters ready to look at a story from all angles.  While obviously unfavorable to Howe, K&S never came close to slandering her - their reporting was consistently objective, looking into her claims and explaining them.  The controversy seems laughable to us, but its principle that bothers K&S.  There are no shortage of minds in America ready, willing and able to apply Moulton-Howe's brand of deceptively objective reporting to more critical matters, like the search for WMD's in Iraq or (just to keep things even) the search for episodes of financial, political, sexual or otherwise unethical wrongdoing by the Clinton administration.<br />Though Kagan and Summers steer away from the exotic legends underlying cattle mutilation, \\"Evidence\\" retains the chill of the legends nonetheless.  While the stories of alien scientists probing the southwest night may be entirely fanciful, the fear upon which they rely is very real - a product (the author's are willing to speculate) of uncertainties generated by the Vietnam war, Watergate, Ab-Scam, the oil-embargo, Iran, Stagflation and the other assorted horrors of the Nixon-Carter years. That thousands of Americans could readily accept the cattle mutilation phenomenon as true seems at least as chilling as the phenomenon itself.	2000-08-06
US	49374774	REE6YO5FAY9MD	0770109349	578530346	Eagles	Books	3	0	0	N	N	When eagles were young	A book about the flying F-15 \\"Eagles\\" may not sound original  (though F-16's typically get more attention), but  \\"Eagles\\" was written in 1978!!  Thus, it takes the F-15 out of its normal  context of flying in the Reagan years or against Hussein.  Further,  \\"Eagles\\" isn't about F-15's in combat, but about the pilots who flew it when it was a trouble-prone, politically beset USAF acquisition - when shoddy production and reliability problems of the ambitious new plane make it a horror to fly.  It's unclear what  \\"Eagles\\" is supposed to be about - or whom, since none of the  several pilots ever rises to become the central charachter - but it wasn't  what I expected, and that's praiseworthy.  In short, several pilots try to  come to terms with the new beast which has its share of problems.  (The  author slyly telegraphs the nature of the new plane's problems before describing them: a USAF PR officer lists the contractors behind the  plane's major components, all seem to match those behind the real F-15,  with the one exception of the guys who built the engines.)  Though there  doesn't seem to be a plot, the author climaxes the action at a round of  \\"Red Flag\\", the USAF's fighter pilot boot camp, where some  fighter pilots are literally flown to death.  The flying scenes, though not  spectacular, are a change from what I've grown used to.  This is a book that's probably disappeared from most book stores.  I'd nab a copy if I could find one.	2000-08-06
US	49374774	R3RKW5PAB6ZUDT	0451408578	332331493	Shattered Bone	Books	1	4	8	N	N	bury this book	In &quot;Shattered Bone&quot;, one of our nation's most trusted fighter pilots is revealed to be nothing more than a deep-cover plant of the  Ukranian KGB.  At a pivotal moment long after the cold war has come to an  end, and after the spy has come to doubt he will ever have to answer to his  masters again, he is plucked out and given one last assignment - steal a  B-1 bomber and fly it on a desperate mission.  Nevertheless it's incredible  that a book so convincing in detail remains not only implausible but  unreadable - almost as it were a product of the Ukranian KGB itself.  The  charachters are flat, whether it's the devious Ukranian spy master or the  civilian heads of our own military who - true to form for the  technothriller - are pleasingly ignorant about military technology and know  less about military technology than the readers of technothrillers.  The  author can't even drum up any sympathy for our hero dragooned into  hijacking a B-1, the titular &quot;Bone&quot;.  While the details of  military procedure reveal their author's expertise (actually, let other  experts confirm the veracity) they don't do much for the author's writing  since the details are only used to buttress a contrived plot protracted for  the sole purpose of displaying minutiae.  In short, the Ukrainians use the  American pilot to steal a B-1 to fly against Russia.  I can accept that the  Ukranians haven't enough of their own planes, or any as capable as the B-1,  but the sleeper-agent idea - aside from ripping off Dale Brown's &quot;Day  of the Cheetah&quot; - seems superfluous, and doesn't make the story more  compelling. It's not quite clear just what the story is supposed to do.   Why not just use an expert Ukranian pilot - his experience with B-1's  couldn't have been any weaker than the American's (The sleeper agent flew  USAF F-16's, a world apart from the B-1) and would've allowed the author to  portray flying from a commie MiG-driver's perspective (now how often does  thathappen?).  Or better yet, a deep cover spy who was supposed to fly  B-1's, but flunked and got sent to fly the proverbial cargo plane full of  rubber doggie-poop out of Hong Kong.  The elements of the story don't gel,  rather they spin out of control and, midway through, I realize that  &quot;Shattered Bone&quot; just never takes off.  To that extent,  &quot;Shattered Bone&quot; makes me appreciate other air-war thrillers, but  otherwise follows them closely enough to mirror their faults.  As with any  technothriller, instead of nuanced charachter development, we get  charachter dossiers; instead of articulated scenes, we get floor-plans;  everything about &quot;Shattered Bone&quot; seems precisely ruled, rather  than subtle like the people who live (and even fly B-1's) in the real  world.  And last, but not least, the flying scenes won't inspire any  spectacular visions of air combat.  Were &quot;Shattered Bone&quot; a  computer flight simulator, it would comfortably run on your dad's old  386-sx.  As a novel, it demands even less of its readers.	2000-08-06

One of the truly great and underappreciated submarine thrillers, Potemkin  gets it right where it counts.  We have the ponderous nuclear submarines,  their technology, the cat and mouse game of submarine warfare in the cold  war, the tensions caused by the catastrophic power these machines can  unleash and the tensions of the men who hold this power in check.  But more  importantly we also have the crew of the submarine USS Barracuda, a  Skipjack class sub whose fate will come as no surprise to those well versed  in the lore of cold-war submarines.  Instead of creating various crew  members as mindless cogs who run Barracuda, Joseph offers a range of the  types who would have presumably served in the Navy in 1968 - fervent  anti-communists to liberals (as liberal as the could be and still serve).   Joseph's main character - Fogerty - isn't meant to be a hero - his flaws  and lack of real direction outside the sonar suite make that impossible -  but his drive, self-created political theory and unwillingness to follow  rules elevate him over the heroic rule-breakers of other techno-thrillers.   With Sorenson, a young sonar operator who hopes to be the best, Fogerty  seeks to hunt down what may be a new class of Russian nuclear sub (the  Alfa).  The pairing also allows Joseph to create code-words that frame the  tension of cold-war submarine warfare, phrases like &quot;Cowboys and  Cossacks&quot; and &quot;Plutonium Pizza&quot;.  very convincing.	2000-08-06
US	49374774	R3TZW24DFUBTFC	055311123X	118006879	Battle Born	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Again?	In &quot;Battle Born&quot;, as in many of the Dale Brown novels, a massive  geo-political shift - Taiwanese independence, the Post-Soviet Russian  invasion of the Ukraine, the Chinese invasion of the Phillipines -  coincides with some revolutionary innovation in military technology.  In  &quot;Battle Born&quot;, the global crisis is a sloppy attempt to re-unite  the two Koreas insigated by the South but reliant on help from numerous  sympathizers in the north.  Because support is not universal among the  North's military, some nuclear armed Communist units escape the  disintegration and carry on their war against the south from the far north,  near the Chinese border.  Because the reunifiation brings many of the  North's nuclear weapons into the hands of the previously nuclear-free  south, nuclear war seems inevitable.  <br />Luckily, the US Air Force has  finalized development of new  weapons designed to hunt down ICBMs in the  most vulnerable aspect of their flight - boost-phase.  So the stage is set  for hi-tech aviation to save the world from nuclear destruction.  Again.   <br />Little of Battle Born differs from &quot;Fatal Terrain&quot; or Brown's  other books - we have the exhaustive descriptions not only of the new  weapons, but also how they use existing hardware as well as the  administrative nuts and bolts of how these weapons will be deployed.  And  since much of the hardware is built on existing goodies - upgraded  B-1's;  the ICBM hunting missile mounted on the old Short Range Attack Missile;  upgraded scud missiles - as is common in Dale Brown books, reader  understanding depends on being familiar with the technology of military  aviation.  A clear link between existing technology and the cutitng edge  technology of the Brown books is intended to make &quot;Battle Born&quot;  plausible.  Unfortunately, accurate details is one of 2, not neccesarrily  exclusive routes towards realism in the technothriller.  The flying scenes  in &quot;Firefox&quot; (thenovel) and its sequel &quot;Firefox Down&quot;  achieve a rarified level of realism despite the fact that MiG-31 of those  books was entirely fictional and remains so 25 years later.  Nevertheless,  the sensations of the human protagonists in &quot;Firefox&quot; - the burnt  out combat vet overwhelmed by his stolen Russian jet - overwhelm any sense  of unrealism simply because they overwhelm a charachter that the author has  convinced us to identify with.  In contrast, the charachters in  &quot;Battle Born&quot; are just organic components of the machines they  fly and the hardware never seems to feel as much a real airplane as a  highly detailed model, like something you'd see in the display case of a  hobby store.  Also, revolutionary technology and revolutionary innovations  of existing technology aren't the same.  It's hard to appreciate what  Brown's new B-1 can do when failing to adequately make the reader  appreciate what the old  B-1B could do, and what it couldn't.  Brown makes  one real effort to showcase the existing B-1B - but that takes place in one  extended sequence involving wargames early in the book, and is so weighed  down by dialog involving seemingly meaningless jargon that, even when it's  understandable, slows the action to a crawl.  While real B-1 is supposed to  have a high-subsonic speed, Brown's variant seems to top off no-faster than  the Wright Flyer.  Because the B-1 remains a cypher of an airplane rather  than a machine whose limits can be appreciated, it's evolved cousin is only  an improvement of a cypher and can't be appreciated either.<br />Brown's books  are clearly meant to appeal to readers who &quot;fly&quot; military flight  simulators on their PC's or just read a lot of books about military  aviation.  Yet, while flight simulators become more intensely realistic  with each year, Brown's depiction of the basics of flight remain unchanged  since &quot;Flight of the Old Dog&quot; of 1987. As always, the men and  women who populate Brown's world manage to have perfectly normal, even  extended conversations while flying his high-performance, high-tech, highly  demanding planes.  I kept having to remind myself that the two USAF  generals discussing the funding, development and deployment of their new  plasma weapons were at the controls of an F-111 in flight, and not in some  stuffy corner of the Pentagon.<br />Also like all Brown books, there are  really two stories: the geo-political story and the story of the heroes -  those daring American pilots who go to war our leaders have started.  The  American story differs little from those of Brown's other novels.  Instead  of charachter development, every player gets a dossier, and few depart from  it.  There is none of the charachter introspection of say Stephen Coomnts'  Jake Grafton (&quot;Cuba&quot;) or &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell for that  matter.  Nevertheless the political side shows a daring new side.  Absent  are the terrorists, crazed Irani fundamentalists, Sun-Tzu quoting Maoists,  dishonest Gorbachev-Marxists and unhinged, deep-plant KGB spies relied on  to drive the other books.  None of the protagonists here want a revolution.   Instead of a few crazed would-be conquerors, we have the governments of  the major powers unhinged by rogue North Koreans who lob nuclear scuds.  A  war is less the result of one incredibly bad decision than hundreds of  smaller decisions that only seem bad when accumulated in hindisght.  Brown  highlights this new direction when describing debates between the military  heads of the now united Korea over how to best use their cache of  communist-built nuclear weapons.  The loudest voices of restraint come from  the ex-North!<br />In short, &quot;Battle Born&quot; shows hints of a new  direction for Dale Brown, offering much to appeal to fans of  technothrillers, but little to anybody else.	2000-08-03
US	49374774	RGWKGJB0H42W2	067170866X	910806669	Typhoon	Books	2	4	7	N	N	The Hunt is Off	After re-reading &quot;To Kill the Potemkin&quot; the author's superb entry in the submarine technothriller genre, I had high hopes for &quot;Typhoon&quot;, but they didn't pan out.  &quot;Typhoon&quot; starts  promising enough: a brilliant Soviet nuclear sub commander, the architect  of Russia's current submarine strategic deterrent - goes to war against his  superiors - political hacks eager to use nuclear blackmail to prevent the  Soviet break up.  The haplessness of the these conservative generals seem  realistic when compared to the protagonists of the inept 1991 coup, but  here they undermine the threat and the tension.  This isn't  &quot;Potemkin&quot; where the Soviet Sub skipper is sailing for survival  and Joseph doesn't create a crew of many-textured types as had populated  the ill-fated SSN Barracudda of that earlier book.  Instead,  &quot;Typhoon&quot; boils down to a standard cold-war yarn and not even the  appearance of an American submarine crew - something that Joseph can shape  as he had in &quot;Potemkin&quot; - suceeds in enlivening things.  Worse,  the submarines themselves lack that sense of mystery that makes them  perfect metaphors for cold-war brinksmanship - we never know where they  are, what they want to do or what they can do, but we know that they can  end the world with the push of a button.  This conflicting sense of secrecy  and unimaginable power was key to &quot;Potemkin&quot; (&quot;Cowboys and  Cossacks&quot; and &quot;Plutonium Pizza&quot;) as well as all the other  famous sub-thrillers.  Too bad the author forgot the most important lesson,  the one he taught other writers.	2000-07-30

In The Plot, the charachters include Matt, a once famouse diplomat now exiled from America because of his role in leaking nuclear weapons secrets to Red China; Emmet, a former President, modeled after Eisenhower, already  living in obscurity but now threatened with a darker place in history for  his role in that same nuclear scandal; Jay, a former internationally  recognized print journalist now going to fat writing cookbooks (also in  obscurity) in Vienna; Hazel, Jay's estranged lover and one-time pupil, who  now surpasses him, but can't get past him; and Medora, a young British girl  exiled in Paris for her role in a Profumo-like sex-scandal involving  high-ranking MP's.  Having nothing apparently in common, besides being  losers, each of our heroes suddenly discovers that the key to their  salvation may be waiting for them in Paris where America, China and Russia  have gathered to hold disarmament talks.  For Matt, it means the chance to  reunite with a Soviet diplomat who can prove Matt was not to blame for  allowing an American nuclear scientist to defect to China.  For Emmett, it  means the chance to talk an embittered and dying German munitions magnate  out of publishing memoirs that will hold the ex-president accountable for  allowing the Chinese a nuclear arsenal.  For Jay, it means reuniting with  Hazel and uncovering proof she hinted at years earlier of Russian  involvement in the Kennedy assasination, proof that will bring Jay back the  journalistic stardom now only a memory.  For Hazel, it means the chance to  scoop her competitors and escape Jay's shadow.  And for Medora, it means  that Paris will be full of British diplomats, including the one who tricked  her into leaving England and then yanked her citizenship.  None of our  heroes sees their plight as having anything to do with the fact that  hundreds of diplomats have come to Paris to decide the fate of the world.  Darker powers are at work, aimed at reshaping a larger chunk of the world  than that inhabited by any one of our protagonists.<br />Except that this is  Irving Wallace, and, despite being over 500 pages long, a series of  impossibly contrived plot devices brings our heroes together first and then  to the realization that more is involved than any of their petty desires.  In fact, what drives the book, and makes it both improbable and enjoyable  is that our loser heroes really are losers who would couldn't nab the last  metro let alone the Sino-Soviet conspiracy.  Instead, our heroes would  wander aimlessly through Paris (much of the book reads like a travelogue)  while their targets continued to elude them.  Our charachters are so dim,  that when they realize the possibility that a larger plot even exists, the  development is abrupt, almost atypical for them, and the novel would  collapse right then if the author hadn't already suspended our belief for  hundreds of pages.  Examples of such howlers - Hazel's Russian lover hints  at Soviet backing for the Kennedy assasination, but Hazel sits on the story  for years; At a gathering of global gluttons, a Russian cookbook author  accidentally spills the beans that the Russians and Chinese have been  meeting together for years, depsite the fact that the two powers are bitter  enemies and the fact that the Russians can't cook lo-mein to save their  lives; Blame for the Chinese defection falls squarely on Matt, a young,  idealistic diplomat, with none being reserved for the president; When  nothing tips our heroes off to the existence of the Sino-Soviet plot,  Medora picks up more clues in an overheard conversation spoken between the  wives of Communist Chinese diplomats - in English!<br />Any one of the above  would kill the book, yet Wallace makes his charachters incredibly fallible  yet gifted in instinct.  They're dim like us, but have pluck and can piece  together clues that we can't making them - and us - seem smarter than they  have a right to be.  It's almost as if Wallace were including his readers  in his plan.  Toss in Paris and the fate of the free world, and the Plot  delivers.ders  in his plan.

US	49374774	R2MVEP82MM2K1F	031218087X	201960968	Digital Fortress	Books	1	6	7	N	N	Indecipherable	In the mood for suspending my belief, I packed &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; on a trip to Orlando and was amazed at how all those Orlando attractions now attained a level of incredible plausibility.  Ostensibly  the story of how a computer programmer creates a virtually unbreakable  code, the eponymous &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;, setting off a  global-manhunt for the only conceivable key, the novel never grows out of a  great idea, never offers remotely plausible or even appealing charachters,  and never creates any tension.  By the end, when secrets are revealed, what  should be  major plot twist has long been undermined by plot contrivances  and fake charachters.  I should have seen the warning signs - the Author  describes the NSA in terms of how many Americans are aware of it.  In one  swipe, the author identifies his readers by their ignorance of the setting  and insures us that much of our suspense will thus rely on our not having  seen &quot;Sneakers&quot; or &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;.  <br />Further  complicating things is the ends by which the author neglects the cause of  pluasibility:  The denizens of NSA headquarters are so dim, it's  inconceivable that they'd be able to run an ISP, let alone the most  sophisticated code-breaking computer in the world.  Our hero is a bookworm  in somewhat adequate shape, but the author presents no credible reason to  explain his survivability against one of the world's deadliest assasins;   The assassin is a bit of a cheat himself - using a PDA (?) to phone in his  kills before their dead.  Once it becomes apparent that the key to  &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; might be engraved on a ring worn by its  creator, prolongoing the hunt for the code-key, the author fails to create  sense that the hit man might be better off tracking down the ring than our  hero.  Instead, and for reasons unknown, the assassin remains forever  two-steps behind.  Much of the tension of &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;  involves just that - the hero tracking down the mysterious code-key ring in  Spain, and boy it gets tired fast, with the hero tracking the ring down  from one owner to the next.  But plausbility isn't what the author is  looking for.  <br />By the time that &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; reaches a  climax, I couldn't care whether the NSA would be destroyed by the killer  code, mostly because the author had by then changed from telling a story to  giving a pitch for some splashy action movie, making the novel's Hollywood  aspirations annoyingly clear.

US	49374774	R1H0NI7KSQ53T5	0399144986	536544726	Resurrection Day	Books	1	11	16	N	N	Everybody Duck and Cover!	\\"Resurrection Day\\" is a mystery novel set in America a decade or so after the nuclear war resulting from the Cuban Missile Crisis. The real mystery however is how one man wrote a book that starts so well and goes so wrong.  Opening with a flourish of details about the now shattered and crippled US of A so perfectly nuanced in their detailing of the fried and irradiated nation that one can't possibly fault the dated attempts to write Anglo-dialog for its british characters or how blatantly the author rips off from the far superior \\"Fatherland\\".  In RD, far from backing down from the brink of nuclear warfare, the Yanks and Ruskies went toe-to-toe.  Though details are scarce, eveyrbody seems to blame the now assumed dead JFK.  (Imagine a world in which Dallas, 1963 never happened?  No disco, no bell-bottoms or mood rocks?  About the only history left pristine was the collapse of South Vietnam).  Though scarred by the war, America is its victor - with Russia bombed back to Tsars.  The only real winners were the Europeans who somehow managed to avoid being dragged into the war or at leats catch some of its heat.  Still armed with nukes, the US's situation approximates that of the former USSR - were too poor to survive, but too powerful to be left for dead.  We're also an embarrasing joke for the rest of the world: even foreigners profiting at America's expense silently pine for the great USA of old. Though the war as described here was actually quite limited, Dubois describes an America in a state of collapse, with whole territories considered lawless zones, and martial law becomes the rule.  All newspapers are subject to military censorship and, for good order, are staffed with army vets - guys not prone to buck the system.  Though it's business as usual a decade later, the author throws in a plot of something brewing: the murder of a visiting Brit who may be on a secret mission; the dissappearance of a vagrant who may have been on JFK's honor guard; the heralded re-opening of Manhattan Island (left sealed off and supposedly deserted since 1962); more secret machinations from the British and also those of the powerful General \\"Rammer\\" Ramsay, and hints that the truth of October, 1962 may somehow turn up.  <br />Then it goes bad.  I'm not sure where, but the author soon takes a turn for the trite. Dubois' hero/Detective is Carl Landry, an ex-soldier who writes government-sanitized news in Boston. Landry's job seems guaranteed to engender in Landry an evolved acumen for investigation, primed to turn the soldier into a true detective. Instead, Landry becomes less an active investigator than a poor shmo powerless to ignore the steady stream of conspiracy theories that come his way. Dubois gives his hero no sense of disbelief and therefore deprives the reader of any sense of surprise.  Dubois's JFK never rises above being the same product of the Camelot myth - eventually enjoying a sort of fulsome praise that undermines this novel as an objective mystery.  By the same token, General Ramsay never becomes more than an uninspired fictionalized version of General Curtis LeMay, the hawkish USAF Chief of 1962.  Though popular, the General is the object of suspicion that Dubois practically telegraphs from the moment his character is introduced.  (Popular blame for the war falls squarely on JFK and his circle; but the sentiment seems forced, making it obvious that conventional wisdom is in for a painful reasessment).  Though billed as a mystery-alternate history in the \\"Fatherland\\" mold, Dubois never ties in the disparate elements of his story to the alternate history as Harris had in that other novel.  There are none of the historically ironic moments of \\"Fatherland\\" (my favorite being a murder victim whose criminal history amounts to a disturbance at a beer hall in 1922).  Dubois spends so much time crafting his alternate history to match \\"Fatherland\\" he almost completely forgets the deft connection between the mystery and the history and the historical figures who live through both.  Few of the characters are developed beyond being foils for Landry, and some details are painfully wrong - when Landry and his british lover meet and relive the story of WWIII, despite the hardships of daily life in post-war America coupled with censorship appropriate to a police state, Landry is actually better informed on the subject than she is.  Also, unlike Dubois, Harris used real figures taken out of their historical context (one of whom, strangely enough, is an altogether different President named Kennedy, and not one anybody will be comparing to King Arthur).<br />It is in its climax that \\"Day\\" compares least favorably with \\"Fatherland\\". The latter of the two books has no happy ending, only the willingness to look the Holocaust square in the face. In comparison, by the end of \\"Day\\" the main charachters pal around, pat each other on the back and congratulate themselves for successfully re-writing history, i could almost hear the laugh track and the strains to the MASH theme. A major botch - nuke this book.	2000-06-30

Mitchel Gant, the harried but heroic aviator of Craig Thomas' cold war techno-thrillers &quot;Firefox&quot; &quot;Firefox Down!&quot; and &quot;Winterhawk&quot; is back.  While Gant, like the technothriller genre,  seem out-of-place in the 1990's, author Craig Thomas knows well enough not  to try stretching outdated ideas. Where once he faced sinister Russians and  high-tech fighter planes, Gant is now on the run from Aero UK, a consortium  of evil MBA's who succeed by literally crashing the competition.  No longer  with the CIA, Gant now investigates crashes for the FAA, poring over the  ruins of airliners nowhere near as exotic as the Firefox.  While  investigating the crash of an Aero UK competitor, Gant is pulled into a web  of corporate deceit not unlike the power-plays of the cold war, and easily  as deadly.  With billions at stake, Aero UK will stop at nothing to prevent  Gant from revealing its role in the saboutage.  Though corporations replace  the KGB and the Vance 494 airliner seems a far cry from the MiG-31, Thomas  pulls it off, producing a gripping novel, with his trademark prose, terse  and fast paced lines written as if the author was in the middle of Tae Bo.  Thomas' detailing of Gant's first flight in the Vance jet conveys the  gravity and fluidity of flight in ways no author-pilot has been willing or  able to approach.  Still, &quot;War&quot; is not quite up to the earlier  Thomas epics.  Its fast pace only highlights how slim a book it is and  Thomas doesn't give &quot;War&quot; the wide scope of say  &quot;Winterhawk&quot;.  There is no superweapon slowly bearing down on  millions, no seemingly unreachable border, nothing to really convey  tension.  And there isn't enough of Gant.  The nominal hero, Gant is only  one of several players, one whom Thomas seems almost reluctant to bring  out.  &quot;A Different War&quot; is only one of Thomas' latest attempts to  say goodbye to the kinds of books he wrote in the 1980's.  I just wish he  wasn't soeager to do so.	2000-06-30
