THIS IS NOT A HORROR NOVEL. it really is not, as stated by a true horror master: H.P.Lovecraft. it is a philosophical supernatural drama. if you want a horror novel, you are looking in the wrong direction. i agree there is something grizzly here, but that does not make horror.	2003-05-16

BC is great at details. always enjoyable to read his battle descriptions. on the human level, however, he's not as great. no, the descriptions of the people's lives are good. it's how he makes the characters. the talentes, moralistic commoner. the hopeless snob. a lost love. and the main character is attacked by an enemy within his own ranks. BC has a typical way of doing things. i wish he could vary, give the plots more depth, make the characters with more characteristics - some good, some bad. it's a good read. could have been great, but i just can't handle the intrigues and the characters at times	2003-05-12

JS makes the family his strength here. the sudden insecurity. the unsaid. the tension. The Family makes the story better, which i find uncommon. a mother with alzheimer burns down her house. she comes to live with a family of her daughter the husband and the son (sort of). she insists on witing for her other dead daugher and arrange a room for her. after a while, mysterious things occur. the tension grows. disaster strikes. i cannot say more without giving away something. let's just say that there is an act of violence treathening to destroy, some strange sightings. this was plot-driven and loaded with suspence, and i found it to be great just one note: DON'T READ THE EPILOGUE. the ending is good enough. THE EPILOGUE IS AWFUL. it's a robert bloch-cliche of the worst kind. you don't NEED to read it. it tells you nothing. it's just stupid and awful to read. tear it out or ignore it. i'm serious. if you read it, you WILL be disappointed, i GUARANTEE it.	2003-05-12

SK shows great psychology here. and there is something about the book that always grabs my interest. why would anypne participate in such a contest, you may ask. that's the book's real depth. there is no one reason. some want to die, one wants to see others die, some look for the meaning of life. the book tells something about humans. how we look for a meaning. how men try to become men. what life is about. the book is actually SK's deepest and most interesting. the one who works best on a human-to-human level too.	2003-05-08

SK never describes his main character as a hero, the old gypsy is never described as a villain, and he feels his wife has betrayed him. she doesn't understand, and she actually does betray him (sort of), and she wants him in an institution. it's not about how you feel the guy should be, it's about how the guy is. i understood the character perfectly. not how i would have thought of things, but it was still realistic. anyway, this guy runs over a gypsy. through the trial he gets help and gets off. as a result he and his helpers are cursed. in his case: he will besome thinner untill he dies. he ignores the whole thing at first, but as he loses weight he begins to take it seriously. he must hunt down the one who cursed him. there is a lot of chemistry in the family in this plot. other reviewers have given away the plot, but i still won't. it was an okay read. but the plot wasn't that great, the suspence just okay carried out. all in all it was very mediocre. but i did not feel that anything was hard to get, or find anything unrealisic.	2003-05-08

Maxim tells you why. he is truly great at not leaving loose ends like that. here, everything is considered. the story is about a station where some force is brooding, trying to escape. one man turns out to be able to see the dead, and a medium that deals with them knows his help is needed. violence occur connected to the station. and there are some details about the dead i won't give away. this was interesting, and i loved the explanations, and the fact that most things turned out to be relevant. not much of the irrelevant nonsens, like a romance having nothing to do with the story, etc. but all in all, this was not great. the story is actually pretty mediocre, developed in a mediocre way.

M knows he's not inventive, so he's not messing up trying to add \\"interesting\\" details destroying the story. he delivers suspence in big packages. so i forgive him his flaws. basically this is a story about a haunting that is really serious. something or someone is in the attic. something is going on in the village. as the main character investigates, he finds a lot of interesting stuff about the house (having a history) and the village (especially about a family of old, a mysterious character, and disappearences). i won't go any further into the plot, as it is very enjoyable read finding out.	2003-04-30

Gretchen (twin) is taking a strong liking to the dull, making a very powerful link between them. unfortunately she doesn't like her mother and sister as much. it was well enough written. entertaining. there were 2 flaws however. one of them concerns a character whose role i cannot reveal, the dollmaker. i didn't care for her. all scenes with her in them seemes a bit stupid. i guess i did not believe in her. the other flaw is the dialogue. sometimes when the twins spoke you could feel there was an adult forming there words. i couldn't believe a girl would say it, or form a sentence in such an adult way. but hey, it's a good book.	2003-04-24

Wakefield was well aware that it was easy for a writer to destroy suspence by revealing and explaining too much. that real horror could be never knowing. the treath is obvious, how it was created not. wakefield has some great descriptions, particularly in Red lodge. some of the works are at a more emotional level, like Blind man's bluff, where we take part of the man's growing fear. sometimes we are given simply a story with a good plot, developed nicely, like in Immortal bird.	2003-04-09

Bierce is here, though i'm not a fan of him, his stories have an interesting concept. brennan's story is not that great, but i was amused. wagner's story contains a very well written opening, but the concept turns out to be poor. between 3 and 4 stars, i'd say. i have to agree that the last part of the anthology, with this mysterious race or whatever, shouldn't been here. hastur turned out to be an entertaining concept.	2003-04-09

Kuttner and Campbell delivers good stories. Campbell's could have been really great if he hadn't ended up with a lot of info about these aliens existence, that were pretty uninteresting.

Hartley is a writer believing mich in subtlety. his style is intelligent, subtle and realistic. what he is truly great at is dialogue. no melodrama, no unrealistic logic, still it carries the reader excactly where he should he, and this without the story being boring or losing relevance. i must admit i only like the horror stories.

P is not quite a sympathetic figure. he starts about being pathetic and patronizing. he is led to believe some untrue things which makes his actions bizzare to the village, and therefore tension starts. between ambition and reality and lack of acceptance, p starts losing his sanity. the book is at times really great, but the plot isn't carried out masterly, and some of the things in the book seem to lack relevance in the end.	2003-04-04

At this, he is a master. he describes the situation before THE happening magnificently. however, when it does happen, the story is over. the horror itself seem to escape Lefanus writing style. his ghost stories are mostly not catching to a modern(living)reader. only 2 of his ghost stories are worth reading. I still recommend this book. the reason are the two stories who are not ghost stories. Carmilla, one of the very best vampire stories, built beautifully through subtle hints, psychology, and descriptions. my favourite gothic story. then it's Lefanu's masterpiece: green tea. in fact, one of the best horror stories ever written! too bad Lefanu insisted on writing so many ghost stories, instead of common horror, otherwise he might be a real master in the genre, as Carmilla and Green Tea proves	2003-03-17
