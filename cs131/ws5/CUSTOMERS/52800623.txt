The obvious question is \\"what would drive someone to do this?\\" and Karnazes does his best to answer that question - because he enjoys the challenge of pushing his body to the limit, because he loves to run, because of the support that his family give him.  Nevertheless you still end the book wondering why on earth he does this and what toll all of this takes on his body.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  It's a very fast and easy read.  I read it in a couple of days, and when I'd put it down I wanted to get back to it - always a good sign.  At times it's very amusing, especially when he recounts some of the reactions that he gets from people when they hear what he does.  It's also a fascinating look into a truly extreme sport.  The writing is very descriptive and you get drawn into the experience of the races that he participates in.<br /><br />I'm only an occasional and part-time jogger, but this book definitely made me feel like getting out and hitting the streets.  Anyone who runs would enjoy this book, though its appeal is broader than that.  My non-running husband really liked it.  This would be a great present for a hard to buy for person.	2005-06-03

During World War 2, with the Nazis heading towards St Petersburg, the Russians packed up as many treasures as they could and sent them across the country to be safely stored.  But they were unable to pack up the Amber Room, so they tried to conceal it in situ.  This ruse was unsuccessful.  The Nazis dismantled the room and relocated it to Konisberg Castle in Prussia.  When the war ended, the Russians went to recover the room - but it had vanished.  Where was it?  Was it still in existence?  There was evidence to suggest that it may have been moved again - but to where?<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of the two authors, as they sift through archived data in both Russia and Germany, and also try to track down any surviving witnesses to that time.  It's very easy to read and surprisingly gripping.  Not a dry history book at ALL.<br /><br />I found the book fascinating from two perspectives.  Firstly, it was interesting to learn about the Amber Room itself, and also about life behind the Iron Curtain in the post-World War period.  But equally, it's an intriguing story of investigation - red herrings, false trails, surprise discoveries - that reminded me in some ways of reading \\"All The President's Men\\" (otherwise a vastly different book).<br /><br />Sometimes it loses pace - but I suppose that mirrors the experience that the journalists themselves had.  Sometimes I also got confused with all the Russian names (particularly one central character who is referred to by different names at different times), but there is a handy \\"who's who\\" at the beginning of the book.<br /><br />Is the mystery solved?  Yes and no.  While there are no definitive answers, the authors draw a convincing conclusion about what probably happened.<br /><br />If you are interested in Russian history, or just want to know what it's like to be an investigative journalist, I recommend this book.y happened.   <br /> <br />If you are interested in Russian history, or just want to know what it's like to be an investigative journalist, I recommend this book.	2004-10-04

In her world arranged marriages are the norm, and girls are commonly married in their early to mid 20s.  When we meet Anju she is aged 33, living in New York and still single - much to her and her family's shame, and definitely not from lack of trying.<br />The book then goes back in time to tell the story of her family's efforts to marry her off.  At times amusing, at others more serious, the book gives great insight into an aspect of Indian culture that many find intriguing or hard to understand.  Anju is a likeable character and you find yourself rooting for her and hoping that a suitable partner will be found.<br />Unfortunately the flashback technique removes most of the suspense from the story, as it is only in the final 15 pages that we finally pick up where the book began.  For this reason, I found that my interest began to pall as I read the book.  You can only read about so many potential suitors who don't work out for whatever reason, and you tire of Anju's ongoing cycle of hope/disappointment/despair.  When it finally comes, the ending feels too rushed after the lengthy build-up.<br />While Kavita Daswani writes with insight about Indian culture, her portrayal of the New York fashion world where Anju ends up working feels superficial and unconvincing, and most of the characters in the book are stereo-typical.<br />Overall, I found this book just okay.  I enjoyed learning more about India and for this reason I liked the first half a lot more than the second.  But I felt it lost momentum as it went on and in the end, I was relieved to let it go.	2003-12-28

This book is not.  It is set in wartime Europe, initially in Paris, later in Moscow and finally in Berlin.  Our hero, Stephen Metcalf is an American working for the Allies in an undercover capacity.  He is curiously inept and also governed far too much by his feelings for a beautiful Russian ballerina, in one of the least convincing romances that I have read.  It is a miracle that he survives to the end of the book, given how gullible he is and how prone to error.<br />The first half of the book is reasonably compelling, but it runs completely out of steam with about 150 pages to go.  The plot twists are implausible and signalled so far in advance that they come as no surprise.  The dialogue is laughably bad and the character motivations are quite ridiculous.<br />It's a shame to see the Ludlum name sullied like this.	2003-12-13

But at the end of the day it doesn't really add up to a lot.  Andrea Sachs, an aspiring magazine writer, lands a job as personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high profile editor of &quot;Runway&quot; magazine.  Andrea quickly finds that the job involves numerous mundane and tedious chores, long hours, incessant demands and enormous personal sacrifices.  The fact that author Lauren Weisberger wrote this book after working as Personal Assistant to Anna Wintour from Vogue adds a lot of credibility to the environment and story.<br />One of the flaws with this book is that the job really does sound like it would be glamorous and (at least sometimes) fun.  Although Miranda does come across as being the Boss From Hell, you still feel that Andrea is just a whinging and ungrateful employee, who performs her job with little grace.  I'm a stay at home Mom, and all I can say is that if it's too much to deal with someone who refuses to eat the food you've bought for them, changes their mind irrationally and makes petulant demands of you, then Lauren Weisberger should never have children!  At least Andrea got to dress in designer clothes, attend Parisian fashion shows and go home at the end of the day.<br />The other problem with this book is that you never really care about Andrea.  In the end she has to make a decision between a job that she hates and a boyfriend and best friend whom I had come to dislike intensely.  It wasn't a dilemma that invoked much sympathy from me.<br />I did enjoy reading this book, but I suspect that I'll have forgotten it by tomorrow.	2003-12-11

It is narrated by her friend Barbara, also a teacher at the same school.<br />I admired this book, but I didn't like it.  Not one of the characters was appealling.  Barbara who narrates the story is downright creepy, obsessed with her friend's life and determined to make Sheba dependent upon her.  It felt a bit like seeing into the mind of a psychopath (minus the violent behaviour).  Sheba is probably the most likeable character, but you feel like shaking her for making such a colossal mess of her life.  Stephen, with whom she has the affair, is just an immature boy and it's hard to see why she becomes so enamored with him.<br />The book is well written but it's quite slow and feels a bit predictable - although the ending brings it all together very well.	2003-11-25

Its worst flaw is that every one of the characters is so downright despicable that you end up not caring a jot what happens to any of them.  You find yourself hoping that Janey will get her come-uppance, but unfortunately when she does, it's short-lived.  The writing is barely okay, certainly nothing outstanding, and the plot development is sluggish.<br />On the positive side, Candace Bushnell obviously knows the Manhattan social scene well and at times you feel that the descriptions are depressingly accurate.  I say depressing because it comes across as being such a shallow and superficial world that I am happy to be well removed from it.  It's kind of fun to guess at the inspiration behind some of the characters - Gwyneth Paltrow, Rupert Everett, Anna Wintour, Aerin Lauder...<br />I continued with this book hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  It's not the worst book that I've read, but I still wouldn't recommend it.	2003-11-18

Although I enjoyed reading \\"Expecting Adam\\", it wasn't at all what I was expecting.<br /><br />Martha Beck's story is intensely personal.  She talks about how her life and her husband's life were transformed by the experience of her carrying and giving birth to Adam, a baby with Down's Syndrome.  Throughout her pregnancy they both experienced a number of spiritual experiences and miracles.  Subsequent to his birth, Adam has brought much joy and wonder into their lives, completely rearranging their priorities and attitudes to life.<br /><br />However Martha doesn't view all these spiritual experiences as being caused by Adam having Down's Syndrome.  At one stage she consults a psychic who refers to Adam as being an \\"angel\\", but who also stresses that his disability is merely a coincidence rather than a factor contributing to his angelic status.  Martha also makes it clear that she doesn't necessarily view all children with Down's as being as special as Adam.  This presents an interesting question about what makes Adam so special and about whether the fact that he has Down's is even relevant to Martha's story.<br /><br />So rather than being a book about what it is like to carry and give birth to a baby with Down's Syndrome, this book is about what it is like to be transformed from being an ambitious and driven academic to a more spiritual person, by the experience of carrying a child who appears to have spiritual powers.  At times I felt that I was reading a memoir written by Mary about being pregnant with the baby Jesus.<br /><br />Because Martha writes well and her story is told with some humor, I enjoyed reading the book.  However I got increasingly frustrated as I went on by how extraordinary she felt her experience to be, and how little I could take from it that was relevant to me or anyone that I knew.	2003-09-25

I normally enjoy books that get inside the head of a female protagonist.  But this one left me cold.  It's the story of Theresa, a beautiful 15 year old living in Long Island who looks after the neighborhood children and animals over the summer.  She is also charged with the care of her eight year old cousin, Daisy.<br />The pace is VERY slow and the book takes a long time to get going.  To me, Theresa (the narrator) never felt real.  She seemed too mature to be only 15.  Her smug confidence in her beauty and its power irritated me, as did her passive observations of so much around her.  Nor did her actions seem particularly believable.<br />Books that I think captured this age better were &quot;The way I found her&quot; by Rose Tremain and &quot;Joy School&quot; by Elizabeth Berg.	2003-06-29

During that time he spent more hours in the company of the Princess than anyone, and it is from this perspective that he is able to give a great deal of insight into who she was and what her life was like.<br /><br />The book is well written and easy to read.  Wharfe gives a very balanced portrait of Diana - not skimming over her faults but also not dwelling on them (in contrast to Patrick Jephson's book which covers a similar timespan).  Overall Wharfe's relationship with the Princess was clearly close, warm and for the most part, one of mutual trust and admiration.  In many ways he was part of the Wales family for several years and became very close to the young Princes.<br /><br />This account is very informative and also has some great snippets of gossip, particularly in relation to the breakdown of the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about what Diana was really like.  This is definitely the most informative and intimate book that I have read about her.	2003-05-25

Early one Sunday she gets a call from her friend Cat Jones who is also editor of Gloss magazine and thus indirectly her boss.  It turns out that Cat's very attractive nanny (Heidi) is dead.  When it turns out that Heidi was poisoned, and then that Cat herself may have been the target, Bailey steps in as amateur detective.  Many of her friends and colleagues are suspects - but who will have committed the crime, and can Bailey catch them before she herself becomes a victim?<br />This is a fun book, with plenty of twists and red herrings to keep you guessing and a Sex in the City style sub-plot which I also enjoyed.  Kate White works for Cosmopolitan and that shows in her knowledge of the magazine industry.  It's genuinely suspenseful in parts but never gory or really scary.  I've recommended this book to several of my friends and those who have read it have also really enjoyed it.	2003-05-25

Well I couldn't put it down, and I ended up reading it all the way through.  Partly this is because it's quite suspenseful and I was worried that I'd have bad dreams if I put it down, but also because it gripped me from the start and held me tight.<br />David Beck's beloved wife, Elizabeth, was murdered eight years previously.  The book opens with the murder, but thankfully it's not described too graphically.  Now, eight years later, he is receiving emails from someone who seems to think that she is still alive.  Pretty quickly it becomes evident that he is also under surveillance and in danger himself.<br />This is a swiftly paced book with several great twists.  I passed this book onto my husband and he read it just as fast and enjoyed it just as much as I did.  I highly recommend it to all thriller/suspense fans.	2003-05-11

Their relationship began with mutual admiration and respect and ended in mutual acrimony.  Jephson could probably have used some time in therapy, but instead he chose to write this book.  It's not intentionally vindictive, but he is so scarred by the experience of working for her that everytime he points out something good that the Princess did, he immediately feels the need to backtrack or devalue that quality.  So, for example, Diana doing needlework on a plane becomes \\"reenacting a scene out of eighteenth century Versailles - another act\\".  Or Diana needing to go to the toilet while on duty becomes a surprise designed to \\"test the ingenuity and resourcefulness of her equerry and to attract the sympathy of anybody else within earshot\\".  You can't help but feel that Jephson was at much at fault in the relationship breakdown as Diana - clearly these are two personalities who just didn't mesh.  For this reason, I ended up taking his conclusions about what was going on inside Diana's head with a grain of salt.<br />The book takes a while to get going.  Early on it doesn't seem to have much structure and there are large sections that are repetitive.  In the second half it finds its feet.  In the early sections I felt defensive on Diana's behalf as Jephson relentlessly criticised her, but later I started to feel some sympathy towards him and the obvious misery that he was in.<br />This book is interesting if you want to find out more about the behind the scenes operation of the Royal Family - how royal tours are organised, what the staff actually do etc.  It also sheds light on the breakdown of the royal marriage, although there are no dramatic revelations here.  But if you are a diehard Diana fan, this is probably not the book for you.	2003-05-11

On the flight she meets Matt and they hit it off and arrange to meet up again later that day.  Sparks fly, but through a series of blunders and misadventures the two lose contact with one another.  At the same time Josie's soon to be ex-husband is flying over from London to try to win her back, and her cousin is about to make a disastrous mistake...<br />This is a quick and undemanding read.  The plot has just enough twists to keep you interested - although you know where it is probably going to end up at times it is hard to see how it is going to get there.  However the comedic part of it falls flat.  It's just not funny and at times it's downright stupid.  Also, the characters are all very one-dimensional.  This means that you end up not really caring what happens to any of them.<br />An okay read, but no more.	2003-05-11

The water level is too low and he is taken to hospital in a coma, with a broken back.  Suddenly everything in Carrie's world has changed.  She doesn't know if Mike will ever wake up, or what it will mean for her if he does.  The book covers the course of the next 12 months as she goes through an emotional - and physical - journey coming to terms with the changes in her life.<br />I loved this book.  It gripped me from the first paragraph.  It's so well written that you want to savour every word and yet at the same time you want to look around you and observe your surroundings as Carrie does.  I could hear her voice in my ear and I really liked spending time with her, even when I didn't always agree with what she did.  The pace is sometimes slow but it never failed to hold my interest.<br />Like several other reviewers I was disappointed with the ending, but only because I didn't like what she had decided to do rather than because it wasn't well written.<br />I think this book would appeal to readers who enjoy Carol Shields, Elizabeth Berg or Jane Hamilton.	2003-03-02

In &quot;True to Form&quot;, Katie is 13 years old and struggling with the problems that are so overwhelming to many of that age: feeling unpopular, wanting to fit in, feeling like her father makes too many decisions for her.<br />I loved the first two &quot;Katie&quot; books and I liked this one too, but less so.  I didn't feel like there was as much to it.  The storyline is very straightforward and it is more about what is going on inside Katie's head.  Also, like so many of Elizabeth Berg's books, the ending felt rushed.<br />Having said that, I do love the way that Berg is able to portray the thoughts of a teenage girl so well.  There were several lines that when I read them, took me back to thoughts and feelings that I haven't remembered having for years.<br />It is also nice to read a book that gets you thinking things like: &quot;am I as good a friend as I should be?&quot; and &quot;do I give people enough of a chance before I judge them?&quot;.<br />If you like Berg's other books, this is a pretty safe bet.  But if you haven't read any before, this is probably not the best one to start with.  I would recommend &quot;Durable Goods&quot; (to my mind, her best book), or &quot;Open House&quot; as a better starting point.	2002-08-06

It shows a picture of an animal with a nonsenical question (eg \\"do monkeys tweet?\\"  \\"do lambs go bzzz\\"?).  Then overleaf you see the animal that DOES make that noise.  My two year old son loves making the noises that go with the animals and calling \\"No!\\" at the top of his lungs in response to each question.<br />Melanie Walsh has written three similar books but this is the best one for younger readers because the animals are shown in full on both the question and answer pages.  Thus it's a great book for building vocabularies and explaining what noises different animals actually make.<br />It's also a great book to read aloud to a group of kids because the pictures and words are large and clear.<br />I'd unhesitatingly recommend it for children 18 months and up.	2002-07-24

It's a good introduction to counting numbers without the confusion of also associating them with objects.<br />There's not much to the story but it doesn't grate on me and it has a little more purpose than some of the other Maisy storylines.

Rather, the author takes a broader approach, that you are your child's teacher in all matters of life.  Moreover, you best serve your child not by trying to \\"instruct\\" them but by giving them the space to develop in their own time and manner, without undue influence from other sources.<br /><br />As a full-time mother, I found a lot that was thought provoking in this book.  It is quite repetitive and tends to feel like a promotion for Rudolph Steiner schooling.  At times I found this a bit much.  However it is nice to find a book that says that you are doing a good job just by being there for your child.  I was also intrigued by the idea that I should be doing less, not more for my son.  That children need space to do their own thing and to observe what you do as an adult more than they need you crawling round on the floor with them or taking them to gymbaroo classes.<br /><br />I take from this book a few ideas of things to try and the reassurance that there are some things that I don't need to worry about.  I am sure that I will read it again as my son gets older.  It is a very readable book and one that I would recommend to any thoughtful parent.	2002-07-09

The zoo sends various animals as a pet but they are all unsuitable for some reason (the giraffe is too tall, the monkey is too naughty etc).  Finally they send the perfect present: a puppy!

My son loves lifting up the flaps and making noises for all the different animals hidden below.  The flaps are also cleverly illustrated so that enough of the animal is visible to allow the child to guess which one is being sent.

The language is really descriptive and captures the noises that the machines make.  The words on each page have been laid out to reinforce the job that the machines do too.  The illustrations are bright and appealing.  This book is a definite winner with any child who likes noisy machines (and what toddler doesn't?!).	2002-07-07
US	52800623	R3N5DAQQ72WZXD	076360481X	155022316	Splash!	Books	4	2	4	N	N	A consistent pleaser	My son was given this book for his first birthday and it's been a consistent favorite since.  The text is extremely simple and repetitive which I think is good for very young readers.  I am sure this book is one of the reasons that \\"hot\\" was one of his first words.  However, I think the main reason that he likes it is because we both bang the pages hard as I say \\"splash!\\" and likewise act out \\"whoosh sploosh\\" and \\"squirt squirt\\".  For this reason our copy is looking pretty battered by now - but we've had a lot of fun along the way!	2002-07-07

It's a quick read that's lots of fun - we always seem to end up in giggles.  I like the rhyming cadence also, which is helpful for speech development.  I would definitely recommend this book from 12 months up.	2002-07-07

It's especially suitable as a bedtime book, describing as it does a day in the life of the farm animals and ending as they curl up in the barn to sleep.  My only criticism is that I find it hard to settle into a rhythm when I read it.  The cadence is uneven and the rhymes don't always work.  I find I often end up skipping lines here and there to make it work better as a book to read aloud.	2002-07-07
US	52800623	R2RLIVHBPLEMCD	0060090375	122477335	Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married	Books	2	4	6	N	N	Junk food for the brain	I'm a full-time Mom who doesn't get much time to read these days, so I guess that makes me more critical of the books that I do pick up.  But I didn't feel like this one was worth the effort.  It wasn't that it was terrible - it's a quick read and amusing in parts - but it didn't stretch me in any way and I felt like it was too long and not amusing enough for the simplicity of the story.  It started well but didn't keep the momentum up.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Life's short and there are too many better books out there.	2002-07-07

It features the work of many different childrens' authors/illustrators.  It's a lovely book to dip into at bedtime - open it anywhere and you've got an appealing song or story.  My only criticism is that it feels too \\"special\\" as a hardback book.  At that price I don't want my son tearing at the pages, so it's been relegated to occasional use only.	2002-07-07

He really enjoys this book.  The premise is very simple - does Maisy live in the stable? no, the horses do etc - but it lends itself to racuous shouts of \\"no\\" as he lifts the flap on each page, which is a lot of fun.  It's also very robust, which I appreciate.  So far none of the flaps have been torn off.  My only criticism is that it's very short.  I feel a bit cheated by that.  If you're after one fun flap book, I would recommend \\"Where's Spot\\" ahead of Maisy.	2002-07-07
US	52800623	R21H2BQQOU9KOV	0399226907	907291850	The Very Hungry Caterpillar	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A deserved classic	My son is 2 and this is one of his favorite books and has been for some time.  The story is simple, the illustrations are gorgeous and the holes in the pages are irresistible to little fingers!  One tip: for young readers the board book is definitely the way to go.  Not only is it more robust (I got sick of sellotaping the paperback pages back together), but it is very satisfying for my son to poke his fingers through the holes and have me poke mine back from the other side.  This book was my salvation on a 4 hour plane trip!	2002-07-07

Books	2	3	5	N	N	Sweet but dull	I bought this book for my 2 year old son because I liked the illustrations and we've enjoyed so many of Eric Carle's other books.  However this one seems to miss the mark.  It's very repetitive and we both find it a bit boring.  There are other books with pictures of lots of animals (eg \\"Brown Bear Brown Bear\\" or \\"Dear Zoo\\") that engage Ben (and me) far more.	2002-07-07
US	52800623	R2BUM5YKWNNRDF	0316158348	22987638	Maisy Goes Swimming	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Lots of fun to read	This book has a very simple concept - taking off all of Maisy's many layers of clothing and then putting on her bathing suit so that she can go swimming.  My 2 year old son loves it to pieces - literally.  Unfortunately it's not very robust, but even now with half the pages in tatters it's still one of his favorites.	2002-07-07
US	52800623	R1YMRD1T9V7FOL	0374286663	35205496	The Way I Found Her	Books	4	0	0	N	N	This book is a delight	Like Harper Lee, Rose Tremain has the gift of capturing the voice of a  child.  In Lewis Little she creates a boy on the brink of manhood - he is  starting to discover his hormones but still has a child's perspective on  life.  He is a character that you want to stay with.  I really enjoyed  spending some time in his company and several times found myself chuckling  at his observations.  The other thing that I loved about the book was the  way that it captures the atmosphere of Paris so beautifully.  The  resolution of the mystery in the second part of the novel is a bit  disappointing, but I was so caught up in the book that I couldn't put it  down.  It's a wonderful, captivating read - don't miss it.	1998-10-15
