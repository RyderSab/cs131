How could he ever, ever explain  all the weird and wonderful creatures introduced in Ilium? Answer - he can't, so he doesn't. Not really.<br /><br />The explanations for the Voynix, Setebos, Propero and many others were dissapointing if not silly. Still other pieces go completely unexplained. I even found a continuity error in the mix.<br /><br />I still love the author's style, but too much is contrived and unexplained. I am not talking the kind of explantion that insults the reader to include. None of these things could be reasoned out.<br /><br />Anyway, despite these things, Dan Simmons has given us Hyperion, and he's given us Ilium, two great sci-fi novels. So, I will continue to read anything that he produces. However, I'm not holding out for the perfect ending.	2005-09-26

Some of the revelations, the images of some of the quantum phenomenon, the extention to known science can be truly mind-blowing.<br /><br />The writing, while ok, can sometimes be dull, especially to someone who hasn't read lots of popular science books about quantum mechnics. Egan is often talking about ideas that intrigue him, and he has many discussions between characters who just go off on many philosophical tangents that don't necessarily forward the story.<br /><br />Egan always does this in his novels, and Quarantine is one of his least distracting.<br /><br />There were at least two times that I thought that book was pure genius and was simply in awe of the ideas and how they were discussed and used in the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel to anyone who already is a fan of Greg Egan or any other reader who want to be challenged and doesn't mind putting up with some of the author's indulgences.	2005-08-15

I don't blame them, I worry about where the books will go after this, but, it's a bold move from Rowling and certainly adds dimention and tension to the story.<br /><br />I love these books and trust the author to deliver and remain true to her original vision.<br /><br />This book delivers steadily, there is always something cool and interesting going on, you are always wondering where things will go next, and Rowling continuously keeps you wondering what will come next.<br /><br />I don't know if it's an editing thing, or a writing thing, but there were a few major points in the book where I thought a character or bit of story could be dropped for progressing the overall plot. This doesn't mean that the bits and pieces aren't interesting, but they weren't streamlined to make the book flow. I hope that I'm wrong and that they are intended for an even more interesting 7th book.	2005-07-24

None of it comes across as dumb or out of date or foolish etc... It all seems like a reasonable extrapulation of current trends.<br />On top of that, there is so much cool, samurai sword, gun battles, car chases etc... scenes to entertain everyone else. Hiro and Raven are two of the most kick ass characters you'll ever meet in what seems like a pretty realistic world - that's hard to pull off.<br />I sepecially liked the historic background, which has the scent of a well done bibilical/babalonian research paper. I'm sure that Mr. Stephenson has read lots about the history of the bible and it's links to babalonian culture and myths. Much of this book's story depends on theories about those historic areas.<br />Still, I think everyone will remember this book for its tech background, the computer simulations and the metaverse. Oh yeah... that and the samurai swords 'cause really, who doesn't like samurai swords?	2003-11-12

The author is now more polished there is more of what I liked about the Neverness universe presented in this book. Mostly, we see Danlo's search for the God Ede, which leads him to system after system in what is certainly a quest for the holy grail.<br />I feel that if you liked the other Neverness books, or any other books by Zindell, you will also like this book.<br />I don't think that there are any other authors who capture the feel of these novels, only Frank Herbert is close in his Dune series. I feel that Zindell is actually better though. I'm sure that many would disagree, but you don't see an author like Zindell very often, and I feel he should be given his due.	2003-11-12

Danlo is his father's opposite in many ways, he is much more likeable, and much simpler. Simple doesn't mean boring, on the contrary, Danlo is intelligent, friendly and deep, with many old beliefs that he keeps throughout his life, even if they seem a little antiquated in such a modern world.<br />Still, Danlo will always behave in the same way given the same situation. He is supremely loyal to his friends and his quest. His integrity is without question unlike Mallory who was much more volatile.<br />Happening almost two decades after the events in &quot;Neverness&quot;, we get to see a young Danlo join the academy on Neverness and work his way through years of training to become a pilot of the order. We get to see much more of the training, the setting for a student in this very futuristic society. It is interesting, and complicated. Without really saying it, Zindell presents us with a society where even the dumbest people are far beyond anyone today in intelligence and will. So, when he works with exceptional people, it's easy to forget how increadibly smart everyone is. It's mostly a background bit of the books, but becomes really noticable once you realize that it's there.<br />Since the whole method of piloting that Zindell has introduced is one of the most interesting ideas in science fiction history, the story can almost not fail. Despite the somewhat cardboard cut out characters, the force of the ideas and extremely well developed setting shine through and give this book excellent impact.<br />I personally think that it pays to read Neverness first, since otherwise the beginning of the book would lose strength because you wouldn't know some of the characters that are introduced there.<br />An excellent book. Not really a sequel, but if you loved Neverness and are looking for another book to read, believe me, you can't go wrong with this book or the ones that follow.	2003-08-28

I have to say, the first half was bad reading. It was Egan playing around with what kind of technology and software the future will have in 50+ years. It is done from a completely computer programmer's point of view, which was interesting enough, but tedious.<br />Another reviewer of a different Egan book said it was like a detective story where the main character is sneaking into a building to get clues and sees a bit of paper and goes into the history of paper production since its inception and what it will be like in the future. The information is irrelevant to the story and actually detracts rather than enhances.<br />Despite this however, I was really glad to get past this and into the 2nd half of the book. Egan gives a feeling of what true immortality might be like and what real loneliness is. I don't know if he intended to, but that's what I took away from this book. With a new type of virtual processor tucked away into its own little universe, untouchable by anyone, the virtual people can live forever, not just until the end of our universe, but really and truely forever. I've never seen it explored before, and find it a great idea. Even someone scared of death must be a little hesitant about the offer of true immortality, not just no aging, not just outliving your friends, but outliving everything in the universe. Billions and billions of years. Forever is a long time and I found it a bit daunting.<br />Another idea that I really liked in the book was concerning loneliness. What's it like to be really alone. Well, some of the characters find this out as they sneak into the artificial universe created for other characters, but they can never interact with it. No one can ever see them or talk to them. They are cut off not only from the world, the universe, but also the only other people who might understand their situation. I can't imagine the utter aloneness of their situation. Sure, they can create anything they want in their simulations of the world, but really - how far can your own imagination go? How much can you create without getting bored?<br />This is a good book that could have been great if it were re-mixed with the right concentration of existing ideas. It's worth reading for the ideas alone.<br />I hear that other Egan books are similar, so if you read this one, I can only imagine that you'd enjoy other Greg Egan books. I will certainly be reading more of them.ing they want in their simulations of the world, but really - how far can your own imagination go?

The two novels share a lot in common<br />and not just from the point of view that there are similar<br />characters in similar roles. In fact that is the weakest<br />similarity.<br />It probably won't matter how long the books are read or who<br />reads them, they will probably never go out of date or become<br />silly like so many other novels in the genre. These two books<br />will endure. This is an amazing feat of vision and intellect.<br />Both books are written about the far future, so far that<br />everything is foreign to us: the technology, the environments,<br />the people, the gods, frequently the language. Even if this<br />is so, the author melds them together smoothly without missing<br />anything or confusing the reader (for long anyway).<br />\\"Neverness\\" and its \\"sequel\\" \\"The Broken God\\" are grand works<br />that encompass whole populations, planets, mythologies,<br />histories, philosophies, disciplines and their evolutions. In fact,<br /> the author frequently wanders off on some philosophical<br />tangent. They are always deep, meaningful wanderings though,<br /> and it's obvious that the author has thought about these ideas a great deal.<br />As a small point, I found that I didn't enjoy the time spend<br />with the Alaloi (the neanderthal's), especially after the time<br />spent in space exploring the solid state entity or the<br />destruction of stars in the Vild. A small price to pay to get to<br />the rest of the novel.<br />Zindell will discuss the meaning of life, the purpose of<br />life and man, he'll talk about the discoveries of many<br />scholars from a variety of disciplines (some of which are<br />specilizations of disciplines that he's created) on just these<br />topics. Never does it seem arbritrary, never does it seem<br />contrived. All the opinions and ideas seem like they have come<br />from long standing philosophies that have evolved over<br />centuries. I'm impressed that he's done this and before reading<br />it, I wouldn't have thought that it would be possible to be done<br />with such believability.<br />Certainly a great read and one of the gems of science fiction.is and before reading<BR>it, I wouldn't have thought that it would be possible to be done<BR>with such believability.<br />Certainly a great read and one of the gems of science fiction.	2003-01-03

I liked the book, but found that there were a few obvious items that they didn't include that I would have liked. The Homeworld:Cataclysm guide uses a tabular list of the ships, their cost, armour, firepower and speed etc... all viewable at once. I thought that should have been here too.<br />In general, the book has good ideas, but I found that frequently, I had radically different strategies than the book that worked at least as well. This is ok, but still, I found that my was was quite obvious. The suggested strategy in<br />\\"The Bridge of Sighs\\" level (building 5 cloaking field<br />generators to cloak your entire fleet) is a little extreme.<br />That's 2500 RU's and it would be nice to have a few RU's around after this level.<br />Frequently, the \\"strategy\\" for doing a level is basically knowing the level ahead of time and little else. How other ships will behave, what conditions will cause the enemy to start attacking and what direction they will arrive from etc...<br />The multiplayer ideas are generally good, and I use them more than the single player level suggestions which I find of less use. I found that a few ships were left unexplored (the drone frigate and the defence field frigate are mentioned but there's almost no info on whether they are useful or not or how to use them).<br />Your mileage may vary, but if you play this game a lot, and have tried many different ideas already, you will probably have used most of the strategies presented here. You'll already know what ships work against which others, what works well as an escort etc...<br />Happy hunting.	2002-11-11

The biggest reason that I read it is because it was in the same world as &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, but I wasn't expecting much from the book. Writers who go back to old material after leaving them for years tend to have flops, just look at the 3rd book in the Ender series.<br />Still, I had to read it, since I love the original so much. I wasn't disapointed at all, I couldn't put the book down, it was fantastic!<br />There were problems with the book, the main reason that the book fails in certain sections is because almost all the characters in the book are geniuses, especially Bean, the main character. He's so smart that he make Ender look a little slow. How do you write the deepest thoughts from a character who by definition is much smarter than you? Orson Scott Card has managed to do it, but just barely. The inability to write a character as smart as Bean leaks out in certain places where Card is just at a loss to say what such a genius might say. Still, he does as good a job as I've seen since reading &quot;Odd John&quot; where the main character is the next step in human evolution.<br />All in all I heartily recommend this book. If you've read and loved &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker fo the Dead&quot; and been disapointed in &quot;Xenocide&quot;, try this book, it's so great to come back to Ender's world.	2002-01-07

Books	3	5	5	N	Y	Ok, nothing revolutionary	The best thing about this book is that it's short and easy to finish.<br />Still, if you're a procrastinator, I don't think it will help you a whole lot. The rules are basic, what do you have to do to stop procrastinating? It's easy; you have to make a decision that you are going to do the things that are important for you and do them. That's what this book says for most of the book.<br />It's good advice, I would have to say, that's exactly the same advice that I would give to someone who wants to stop procrastinating.<br />On top of this, the author also gives reasons why we procrastinate, which may or may not be useful to you, it was somewhat useful to me, as it tells me that my situation is common enough to have a label. There is also a set of exercises in the book that is better than nothing at all, although a tried and true procrastinator is almost definitely going to avoid doing them.<br />The biggest deal with this book for me was to let me know that my procrastination problem isn't really bad at all. Some of the stories in this book were frightening, people who lose their lives over procrastination. There must be another word for procrastination, that isn't procrastination, it's much worse.	2002-01-07

This facinated me, the idea of something right under your nose that you see, but you ignore.<br />Every city has one, so there's one right here, right now. There are probably people walking past me going about their own business, in their own world. These are people I see, but somehow my mind, in a modern above-world psychology, forgets about it in the next instant.<br />I just think of the homeless person I passed on the street the other day, he was huddled under a blanket. I passed him, and didn't think about him again until I wrote this review. That's the Wellington &quot;Neverwhere&quot; at work.<br />A facinating piece of fiction, with all of the wizardry and creatures you'd find in any fantasy novel, but with an edge of the frighteningly familiar. There are images of things you see every day that you never think about, unless you bother to focus on them.<br />The one book that this reminds me of more than any other is &quot;Seventh Son&quot; by Orson Scott Card. It's a view of colonial America, but where all the hexes and jinxes are real. These two books are very similar, but this one is much closer to the modern world and what you see around you every day.<br />If you like this book, take a look at Orson Scott Card's &quot;Tales of Alvin Maker&quot; series. The first three books are excellend and strike a similar chord in me. Also, take a look at other books by Neil Gaiman, especially any of &quot;The Sandman&quot; comics or graphic novels where Gaiman's writing is brilliantly matched up with pictures that match the gloomy, strangely lit world that is close to &quot;Neverwhere&quot;	2001-10-16

The cartoons never hit me as heavily as the book did. The impact of these simple children's stories is remarkable and I found myself profoundly moved by the various characters acting out of love, devotion and their sense of ideals. &quot;The Happy Prince&quot;, &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; and &quot;The Nightingale and the Rose&quot; were especially touching.<br />It isn't an easy job to write a story for children that carries over on another level when the reader is an adult, yet Oscar Wilde has done it with an entire collection. I'm very impressed and can recommend it to anyone.	2001-03-15

I'm currently reading &quot;Polgara the Sorceress&quot; and find the same true there. In the original series, Belgarath is THE legend, the eternal man, almost holy in many cultures. In this book, you finally see that despite being 7000 years old, he's still a little slow and requires almost constant input from &quot;the Necessity&quot; or Aldur to be able to do anything. Seldom does he do anything clever on his own, and he frequently depends on the stupidity of his enemies (Torak, Urvon, Zedar etc...) to succeed.<br />This destroyed some of my image of the character and it's just due to lazy writing. I get the distinct impression that most of this material was written before the first series of books (in proto form anyway) just to give background to this one character. This is fine, but it takes a lot of work to make a character intelligent, and you just don't see this here. A 7000 year old man should have unique perspective, be enormously clever and outwit practically everyone. That would have been too hard to do however, so you have to see the 7000 year old man who's pretty much just like everyone else. It succeeds in the first book because Belgarath is rarely the main character and the story isn't told directly by him (i.e. first person).<br />Still, if you liked the Belgariad, you really can't fail with this book, most of the history is at least somewhat entertaining, especially the initial calling of the diciples of Aldur to the Vale. I found that most interesting.	2001-03-06

I'm convinced that Mr. Singh is a genius at conveying difficult information to the masses. May his writing career be a long one. I look forward to anything else he writes, whether it be a book or a television show.<br />Simon Singh has a special gift, the gift of being able to explain what could easily be a dry and boring subject. Some of the cryptography in the book is technical and complicated, but he always manages to simplify it to a reasonable level without losing what is special about it. You end up completely understanding the methods used to break each of the progressively more difficult codes.<br />I loved the inclusion of people's notes, original paintings and photographs too. There are photos of the original Linear B tablets and tables of different characters, the Rosetta stone, the original Enigma machine and the designer and all of the code breakers. While reading it, you think of the photos as an aside, I realized near the end that it is a spectacular collection (and selection) of photos.<br />I promise you, if you have even the remotest interest in the subject of codes and code breaking, you'll love this book.	2001-02-15

I enjoyed this book immensely and can recommend it whole heartedly to just about anyone. It comes down to the fact that I would have loved to be involved with Sonny Hickam, O'Dell, Quentin and the rest of the rocket boys when they were building rockets. Most of my friends are in the same boat, it was practically an ideal teenage life, despite many obstacles faced along the way.<br />I wish I could have read this book when I was 14, because it may well have changed my life. The ideal reader for this book is someone in their early teens who's interested in science, I can imagine the dreams that it will inspire.<br />One small problem I had with the book was that whenever Sonny was talking about Dorothy Plunk, or how to remove a bra, or a fight with his Dad, I always wanted to get back to the rockets. What was the next fuel source, nozzle design or rocket casing? I realize that this would have turned the book into a text on rocket design, so it's better the way it is, but I still found myself wanting the next lauch or test or learning experience.<br />I think that I can easily say that this is an instant classic, destined to be enjoyed for decades to come. I would like to see it added to school curriculums too, I certainly wish it would have been on the list of my Grade 9 novels.<br />Oh... on a final note, if you liked the book, do see the movie &quot;October Sky&quot;. It is a great movie, one of my favorites in 1999 and in its own way, just as good as the book.	2001-02-08
US	52991913	R2PDEO65VEDBX2	0679736247	457710988	The Book of J	Books	1	29	47	N	N	I just don't buy it	The most interesting part of this work is that the book of J exists at all. I like the idea that reminence of an original author or authors still remains in the bible. Unfortunately, Bloom doesn't touch on the separation of the book of J from the rest of the bible or how we should even believe that the book can be separated.<br />My biggest hang-up with this entire book is the lack of scholarship. Bloom isn't a biblical scholar and can't reason his way out of wet paper bag. Almost all his reasons as to why J is a certain person (or even female at all) are so vague and ambiguous as to be useless. He claims that females are treated differently in this book that in E, P and D's sections of the first 5 books. Excuse me, but Eve caused the fall of man, Lot's daughters' got Lot drunk and slept with him to get pregnant (an act which went unpunished by the way) and the list goes on. I don't see women as any kind of heroes in the book at all. I think that Bloom picks a female because it is more controvertial ... period. It's a bold step, I'll give him that, but can't be justified, at least with any of Blooms arguments.<br />My second hang-up with &quot;The Book of J&quot; is the translation by Rosenberg and Bloom's treatment of that translation. My first clue was Bloom pounding on the ideas of barriers being a central theme of J. The barrier between snake and other animals after the fall, the barrier between people after Bable etc... I started looking into this idea, since the King James version didn't touch on this theme at all. I looked at no less than 5 other translations of various passages and the idea of barriers never came up. Young's literal translation was the most interesting, since he basically covers literal words used from ancient Hebrew translated to English. While there are words like &quot;separate&quot; and &quot;separated&quot;, there is no mention of a barrier. The barriers as a theme seems to be an artifact of the translation, not &quot;a restoration of the theme of barriers&quot; as mentioned by Bloom. As I became aware of this, the translation seemed to harp on barriers more and more, quite akwardly in some places. This was true of almost all the themes that Bloom touched on. I became quite unimpressed with Rosenberg's translation and think that it was done deliberately. A translator injecting a theme is no theme at all.<br />Despite these problems, I found Rosenberg's translation told the story quite well and was fun to read. Analysing it literarily probably won't give anything to you about the original themes unless Rosenberg's guesses are somehow correct. That would be a fluke of hundreds of unlikely situations that makes the translation no better than anything else out there.<br />The problems with the translation mirror the problems with Blooms logic throughout. Bloom disagrees that J was multiple authors. He thinks that J was one person. The style for authors at the time was to write one type of work, while the book of J covers prophecies, epics, a flood disaster etc... all very different types of works. This seems to point to the idea that J was many authors. Blooms disagrees, saying that many authors who are great do things differently from their contemporaries and from people who came before. And that's it! Nothing more substantial. This is tenuous in the exterme and typical of Bloom throughout the book.<br />I'm still holding out for &quot;The Hidden Book in the Bible&quot; by Richard Friedman, hopefully it will be a little more reasonable.he theme of barriers&quot; as mentioned by Bloom. As I became aware of this, the translation seemed to harp on barriers more and more, quite akwardly in some places. This was true of almost all the themes that Bloom touched on.

That would be a fluke of hundreds of unlikely situations that makes the translation no better than anything else out there.<br />The problems with the translation mirror the problems with Blooms logic throughout. Bloom disagrees that J was multiple authors. He thinks that J was one person. The style for authors at the time was to write one type of work, while the book of J covers prophecies, epics, a flood disaster etc... all very different types of works. This seems to point to the idea that J was many authors. Blooms disagrees, saying that many authors who are great do things differently from their contemporaries and from people who came before. And that's it! Nothing more substantial. This is tenuous in the exterme and typical of Bloom throughout the book.<br />I'm still holding out for &quot;The Hidden Book in the Bible&quot; by Richard Friedman, hopefully it will be a little more reasonable.	2000-11-23
US	52991913	R3AGI21AXBSCON	0812508645	216137473	Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Second echelon for Card	&quot;Pastwatch&quot; is about a group of people in the future who have developed the technology to look into the past. With their machines, they research endlessly and discover events like Noah's flood and the origin of slavery. As an amateur historian, I was more than a little excited about the ideas in the novel. Card also does an excellent job conveying the difficulties of being an historian in this world, many small factions form and hold on tightly to their small tid-bits of information, hoarding their history. The majority of the novel, of course, focuses directly on Christopher Columbus and his quest to find the new world. Card draws many parallels between Columbus' world and the future world of the historians, their struggles are often the same.<br />This is a good Card book, but not a great one. It is as strong on ideas as any of his other works, but just doesn't have the impact. The power of this novel isn't in the same league as Card's earlier books, especially &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; which were simply superb.<br />There is a vague sense of conflict in the novel (man against his environment) that just never gains focus and things work a little too smoothly for all of the main characters. There is personal stress, but all of the characters are so eager to do what they have to do that the personal stresses just seem secondary.<br />All in all a good book, but I know Card can do better.	2000-10-27

David Brin writes a very technical novel which is a turn off for some people, including a few friends of mine who don't warm up well to hard, &quot;scientific&quot; sci-fi books.<br />Another turn off for some people was the lack of characterization. Some of it was a little weak and characters don't act exactly how I would predict in the emergency situations that they find themselves in.<br />The rest of the book shines making it a classic novel in the genre. The ideas are on a cosmic scale with God like aliens, galactic civilizations, libraries that hold the sum of all knowledge and the key idea of uplifting a primitive species to full sentience.<br />I think of David Brin as a newer and more polished Arthur C. Clarke. As literature, Brin isn't quite in the upper echelon of sci-fi (try some early Orson Scott Card and early Dan Simmons) but with ideas, Brin is the very best.	2000-10-26

The list is exclusive, and Azimov is one of only a handful of people to accomplish this (Orson Scott Card - twice, Ursula LeGuin - twice, Arthur C. Clarke - twice, David Brin, Joe Haldeman and William Gibson are the others that I know of).<br />Having read Clarke's &quot;Randezvous With Rama&quot; and Card's &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker fo the Dead&quot;, I thought that &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; was going to be a great book. It was good, but my expectations were too high.<br />I like Azimov's writing style, he isn't a literary giant, but he knows this and is intelligent enough not to try. He places an excellent mix of pace, simplicity and plot to carry the book along nicely. I found that the book depends a little too heavily on one plot trick that I guessed early on. This marred the overall impact of the book, but didn't destroy it.<br />The book fully deserves the 3 stars I gave it and maybe more depending on how you like Azimov. If you loved the book and want something similar, you can't go wrong with most of Arthur C. Clarke's material, especially &quot;Randezvous with Rama&quot; which I mentioned earlier. Also, Azimov's &quot;Foundation&quot; books are written in a similar style and carry about the same weight.	2000-10-25

Not only is this a Hugo and Nebula award winner (along with its sequal), but it is exceptional even among the other winners over the years. Card writes about a young boy being groomed to be the next Napolean, a master strategist and savior of humanity.<br />Not only is the book well written, the characters are deep and meaningful, they are tied together in a tight, well woven story and Card doesn't shy away from several moral issues that might have gotten in the way of a lesser writer.<br />If you liked this book and are looking for more of Card's work, try the &quot;sequel&quot; &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; and his fantasy trilogy &quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker&quot; which starts with &quot;Seventh Son&quot;. All are equally brilliant.<br />Unfortunately Card never quite matches the power of these 5 books (the two Ender books and the Alvin Maker books) although he tries several times, including sequals to all of these. The next one to come along worth reading is probably &quot;Pastwatch&quot;.<br />For authors who are similar, try Dan Simmons's &quot;Hyperion&quot;, another great work that is remenecent of Card's books.	2000-10-25

This is an easy sell, the book is written with its own rules and conveys information in a clear, succinct manner.<br /><br />I want to clarify a few points. The book isn't giving directions on how to write poetry, or literature. The book is about clarity and conveying information. It also isn't the be all and end all of style, there are some other excellent books that do as good a job.<br /><br />The reason that I would choose this one over those others (\\"The Craft of Research\\" or \\"Style: Towards Clarity and Grace\\") is that this book is so digestible.

One of the reasons I give this book 3 stars and Gish's book 1 star is that Eldredge says more to justify his views of evolution than Gish ever does to justify his views of creation.<br />As an example, Eldredge uses words like &quot;pathetic&quot; and &quot;puny&quot; to describe creationists opinions. I don't care if the opinions are puny or pathetic, give me the facts and leave out the creationist bashing. Eldredge speaks far too much in general terms about creationists (they tend to use the following arguments) and far too little with specific points. Gish at least looks specifically at certain points about evolution, liberally quoting evolutionary biologist and other scientists, even if he is off the mark more often than not. Eldredge seldom quotes creationists, he usually just talks about them.<br />In the end, most of what Eldredge says is pretty good information, but won't do anything to sway a creationist who is reading the book. Because it lacks weight (in size and content), it ends up being a comfort book for evolutionist and little more.	2000-10-15

Books	1	88	135	N	N	A deeply hypocritical and ironic work	I found this book difficult to read, bordering on painful actually. There is some science in the book, just like there is some hydrogen in water, but hydrogen isn't really water, just like this book isn't really about science.<br />To his credit, Gish has obviously spent a lot of time looking into evolutionary theory, reading and looking for inconsistancies and general pieces to pick apart. I dare say, with someone like Gish working full time, you could probably show that there is excellent reason to dismiss Einstein's theory of relativity, cosmology and quantum physics.<br />Gish finds many apparent difficulties with evolutionary theory. However, how much incorrect, misinterpreted and mis-reasonsed material must I wade through to get to the legitimate stuff? If this were a book about any other material, I would have stopped reading much earlier, but it was important to me that I see all that he had to say.<br />Sticking to the material in the book, Gish consistantly demonstrates a misunderstanding of evolution. Not only that but points he makes about evolution, he beats to death again and again. Some of the more serious mistakes are his idea that an ancestral species cannot be alive at the same time as an offspring species. This is like saying that a father and son cannot be alive at the same time. Similarly, he assumes that evolution says that EVERY SINGLE simple form can't be alive after a more complex form. Using my earlier analogy, this amounts to an assumption that every uncle must be older than all his nephews. While this is mostly true, it doesn't ALWAYS have to be true. Pointing out a few cases like this doesn't do anything to the overall theory. He does the same with dismissing artificial selection as evidence for evolution. The points he makes about this do nothing to remove it as an excellent example of an evolutionary mechanism.<br />People reading Gish must understand that every scientific theory is wrong, and always will be. Newtonian physics was treated as true for 400+ years until Einstein developped general relativity and predicted outcomes that Newtonian mechnics got wrong. To take Newtonian physics (as an analogy to Darwinian evolution) and say that it was a lie is misleading. People still use Newton's laws to launch probes into space. This is even after we know that the rules are less correct than Einstein's which will one day be replaced by even better theories. Evolution is the only natural theory to explain the development of life in its many forms.<br />That being said, Gish has to replace evolutionary theory with something better. While he is eager to put creationism in its place, where do we go from here? What scientific direction do we take in anthropology, paeolotonlogy, geology and cosmology? Do we now assume that God has his hand in everything that we see from those fields? It seems safer to assume not, since what kind of prediction would you be able to make with that in mind?<br />Science and religion are not in conflict, the conflict is between modern science and science from biblical times. Gish tries to use modern science to show that science in Biblical times was superior to modern science. This is ironic in the extreme.<br />My efforts to keep this review short have failed and I have so much more to say. Even after Gish's ineptitude with his reasonings with evolution, he makes this look like genius when he tackles the bible and the contents within. Pick up a book on the history of the bible like Robert Graves' &quot;Hebrew Myths: The Book of Genesis&quot; or Robin Lane Fox's &quot;The Unauthorized Version: Truth and Fiction in the Bible&quot; for real treatments.<br />If you would like to discuss the book further, please contact me, I'd be happy to continue critiquing this book.ted as true for 400+ years until Einstein developped general relativity and predicted outcomes that Newtonian mechnics got wrong.

Without calling the concept Punctuated Equilibrium, Niles  Eldredge introduces the idea to the reader. Basically, it is a myth that  evolution happens at a steady rate through time. Rather, organisms are  stable for millions of years and then in a relatively short time (5  thousand to 50 thousand years) change very quickly.<br />The author also shows  that this is the same for the evolution of human culture throughout human  history. Relative stable culture, and then sudden rapid change. Modern  culture seems to be the exception to the general rule. He didn't know why  biological evolution and cultural evolution parallel each other this way,  since the mechanisms seem unrelated.<br />There is also an introduction to the  main players in the story of human biological evolution. A history of  Neanderthal, homo habilis, homo erectus, A. aferensis, A. africanus and a  few others is offered. The locations of the discoveries, as well as the  people who made the discoveries and the situations under which the  discoveries were made is covered in some detail. There are numerous skulls  shown to scale that are very interesting. This is probably the most  interesting part of the book.<br />A point that the author fails on is  addressing the mechnisms of evolution. Are mutation and natural selection  sufficient to explain punctuated equilibrium or are there other mechnisms  at work here that are unexplored? The author also seems to dwell on  speciation as a driving mechanism, but I fail to see how it is a mechanism  at all.

It isn't a bad  book, all of the memory techniques work and are a complete set (remember  faces, numbers, facts, lists etc..) and the book is well written.<br />The  biggest reason that I give it a 3 star rating instead of a 4 or 5 is that  the book is badly dated. It needs a re-write or a new edition with photos  instead of bad line drawings (of people's faces for the remembering names  section) and the constant references to cigarettes (I don't know why, but  there is always cigarettes to remember on half of the word lists and  various examples, a pet peeve for a non smoker).<br />If you're looking for a  better book, check out Kenneth Higbee's &quot;You Memory&quot; which I  consider THE book on memory and memory techniques. You can also check  Lorayne's newer books. &quot;The Memory Book&quot; by Lorayne and Lucas is  much better and much newer, although it contains almost identical  information.	2000-08-04

The techniques in this book work, there's no reason why they shouldn't, they've been working for years. I have to say, in some cases, I thought Trudeau's peg words were better than others I've read and he does all the usual techniques, albeit with different names.<br />That being said, I considered the book almost un-readable. After reading the much better \\"Your Memory\\" by Kenneth Higby (the best of all the memory books in my opinion), \\"Use Your Perfect Memory\\" by Tony Buzan and a couple of Harry Lorayne's books (\\"How to Develop a Super Powered Memory\\" and \\"The Memory Book\\" with Jerry Lucas), I found this book sub-standard. Trudeau baby feeds the information to the reader, constantly assuming that you are stupid. The amount of repetition is unnecessary, and seems just like padding (why not just tell you to re-read it?). There are a lot of statements like \\"Ok, now stand up and repeat the words out loud\\", \\"Now do it again\\" etc... He talks down to his readers throughout. If you don't mind that, you'll probably like the book.<br />On top of that, Trudeau never gives credit where credit is due. He leaves the reader to assume that all of these techniques are his own invention, when they are actually just variants of systems in common use. He uses a variation of a phonetic system created in the mid 1600's but never says as much, maybe he doesn't know. The book often reads like a Mega-Memory advertisement.<br />Finally, Trudeau gives tons of scientific \\"facts\\" about memory and imagery without ever feeling the need to back any of it up with a references (Apple didn't create icons by the way, that was Xerox). He says that you shouldn't take notes because it encourages you to forget what you've written, but saying it out loud enourages you to remember. Saying it out loud gets you to use your vocal cords and \\"Neruo-muscular memory\\" kicks in because you're using your vocal course which creates more memory links. What about your eye seeing you write something, your hand muscles moving the pen etc...? Aren't those neuro-muscular too? I don't know how many of the scientific \\"facts\\" are true or not, but I saw enough wrong to doubt most of the rest. The whole thing is written in a shoot from the hip fashion without verification from other sources.<br />All the other books I quoted either supplied references (Higbee), or avoided making scientific statements at all (the rest). Either way, I respect those authors much more.hat about your eye seeing you write something, your hand muscles moving the pen etc...? Aren't those neuro-muscular too?

Even if they are sometimes  introduced by other names, all of the techniques are variants and  combinations of word-substitution (mostly used for foreign words, but also  people's names and words that can't easily be pictured), link, peg, loci  (sometimes called Roman Room technique) and phonetic (letter for number  substitution) systems. The book is mostly re-hashed information that has  been presented earlier (even by Lorayne himself), but the writing style  makes it a book worth keeping.<br />The real strength of this book over others  of its kind is the dialog between Lucas and Lorayne. They are fun to read  and almost never get boring. There are anecdotes to at the beginning of  most chapters and spread throughout the book.<br />Personally, I found Kenneth  Higbee's &quot;Your Memory&quot; a better book, it's more complete a  reference and gives much more of the why of memory rather than just the how  of remembering. Depending on your needs, you might like this book more,  it's got more examples on how to use the systems it introduces and is much  lighter and a little less dry, although Higbee's book is very  readable.<br />As with every other memory book, the techniques take time to  learn and take considerable effort, but work very well. For a book on  memory techniques, this book doesn't dissapoint.	2000-08-04

It matches the rift war saga in enjoyability and  surpases anything else that Feist has worked on. I haven't read any Janny  Wurts stuff, so I don't know how it compares.<br />The book is almost  historical fiction, except the events take place in a completely ficticious  asian style world. There are enough fantastical elements (the black ones  and the Cho-ja) to keep fantasy enthousiasts entertained, but this goes far  beyond run of the mill fantasy novels. The writing moves along at a great  pace, it starts fast and never stops. The characters are almost always cool  and fun to read about, there are seldom characters who you are sorry to get  back to when their plot line rotates back again (especially the spy master,  I loved that guy).<br />If you've read these books and are looking for  something along similar lines, you'll almost certainly be entertained by  Sean Russell's &quot;Initiate Brother&quot; and &quot;Gatherer of  Clouds&quot; which are very similar and just as fun to read.	2000-08-03

The others were (in order of my  preference) &quot;Your Memory : How It Works &amp; How to Improve It&quot;  by Kenneth Higbee, &quot;The Memory Book&quot; by Lorayne and Lucas,  Buzan's &quot;Use You Perfect Memory&quot;, &quot;How to Develop a  Superpower Memory&quot; also by Lorayne and finally Kevin Trudeau's  &quot;Mega-Memory&quot;.<br />The techniques are organized a little  differently from most books and he separates them into minor and major  systems. The minor systems are the simple pegging systems, which associate  the numbers 1-10 (or letters A-Z) with what you want to rememeber.<br />The  major system is usually called the phonetic system or numbers to letters.  It is a phonetic substitution for numbers that let you turn a number into  letters and words. Most memory books also include this system.<br />Of course,  all of the books have chapters on remembering names from faces, the most  common memory trouble that people have. They all give the same suggestions  with little variation and all of them work very well.<br />Overall, I liked  Buzan, but thought Higbee's book was much better. If you only want the  techniques and don't care about background and research results, this book  is as good as any (Lorayne and Lucas's &quot;The Memory Book&quot; is very  comparable to this one). If you want more depth and information, I suggest  &quot;Your Memory&quot; by Ken Higbee, which is a much more complete  reference to memnonics and memory in general.	2000-08-02

He writes that he fills in a very specific niche that isn't being filled by current memory  books. I think that he is right.<br />I have recently read 4 other memory  books, Kevin Trudeau's &quot;Mega-Memory&quot;, Tony Buzan's &quot;Use Your  Perfect Memory&quot;, Harry Lorayne's &quot;How to Develop a Superpower  Memory&quot; and Lorayne and Lucas's &quot;The Memory Book&quot;. I have  read some of them previously, but intentionally read them over with the  intent to compare them to each other and see if there was any  difference.<br />If you are already sold on various memory techniques  (pegging, loci etc...) and only want to learn the techniques, it really  doesn't matter which book you read, they all contain the same information  about the actual techniques. All of them usually have a little history  included as well about where the techniques come from and how they  developed.<br />Higbee, however, goes one step further than all the other  books. He is aiming this book at students (I'm sure this is a text book for  his memory course), educators and intelligent readers. He gives answers to  long time questions that are so often asked (what is a photographic memory?  Do different systems interfere with each other?, will you forget what you  remember? How good are the different techniques? etc...). Higbee answers  all of these and more in a clear way with little ambiguity. He provides the  latest research and references to medical and psychological journals on how  the techniques work, results from various students in his classes and his  own experiences. He looks directly at problems with the memory systems and  addresses criticism from various sources.<br />The book left me impressed and  addressed all of my questions and even questions that friends asked me  after I'd read the book.

Every known species of dolphin and propoise is covered, and he includes a wealth of facts about each species. Take care, this isn't a whale watching book,  the only whales covered are the killer whale, false killer whale, pygmy  killer whale and long and short finned pilot whales.<br />I was particularly  impressed with some of the rare photographs of river dolphins such as the  amazon river dolphin, ganges river dolphin and Chinese river dolphins that  I have not seen in other books. Of course, he also has spectacular photos  of the more common species. The ones without photographs were the  Franciscana, Hourglass dolphin, Fraser's dolphin, Chilean dolphin,  Burmeister's propoise, Vaquita and Spectacled porpoise all others included  at least one photograph.<br />Included with the description of each species is  a world map of their ranges, a pencil sketch of each species (especially  useful if there is no photograph), when they were first identified, diet,  population, other common names, reproduction information, a sketch of their  skulls and interestingly enough sound emission information (frequency range  and where the research was done etc...). This is only part of the  information included, he's got all the common information about size and  field identification too of course.<br />What I like about the book is that it  can easily be used as a browsing book for people with a casual interest if  they want to ID a dolphin they've seen, or somone looking for a little more  detail.<br />There is also and excellent introduction to the book which  includes general information about all species, the taxonomy, sound  production and hearing, fossil record information and much more.<br />You  can't really go wrong with the book. If you like this book, I also suggest  Eyewitness Handbooks &quot;Whales Dolphins and Porpoises&quot;  by Mark  Carwardine which is just as good and covers all of the dolphins and  porpoises plus all the whales. That text is a little less technical without  the skulls or sound frequency information and is geared more towards whale  watchers.porpoises plus all the whales. That text is a little less technical without  the skulls or sound frequency information and is geared more towards whale  watchers.	2000-07-23

It is concise, well written, and useful at every stage of software construction.<br />There are at least 3 copies floating around the office. As developers browse through  other people's copies, they realize that it's a great book to have.<br />The  only drawback, and this is just a sign of the book's age, is that it works  primarily for procedural driven languages. This is almost assumed from the  beginning, since Object oriented languages were much less developed then.  An updated version for OO is necessary and would definitely be  welcome.<br />The book describes practices how an individual programmer can  make themself better at building software. By necessity, this overlaps  other facets of software development, including managing projects, but the  bulk is for the individual programmer.<br />I can't tell you how much this has  effected my personal practices. It makes a world of difference, especially  to the middle of the road programmers, which is the biggest group in the  software community.<br />As Mr. McConnell says, the best programmers take a  lot of this material for granted, and the worst think that they don't need  it or that it doesn't exist. As a result, a lot of the practices go  undocumented and are lost to those who could benefit from them. They are in  this book and clearly spelled out and well organized.<br />If you are  programming for a living, and want to get better at it, this is the book  for you.	2000-07-04

I read this book a few years ago when I was really into whales and whale watching and wanted a little historical perspective. I did get that and more, and less, depending on how you look at it.<br />The book is long and  difficult to get through. There are many chapters and parts of chapters  that don't have to be included. As an example, there is a chapter on the  identification of various species of whale, what they look like and where  they range etc... From my previous whale knowledge, I knew that in several  descriptions, multiple species were crammed into one and sometimes one  whale was split into more than once species. Interesting, but hardly  important to the story.<br />If I were going to edit the book, and keep only  the pieces that are of masterpiece quality, I'd have somewhere around 50  pages (the book is about 500 pages). At its best, the book is lyrical,  suspenceful, the characters are deeply developed and their actions are  believable. The story is exciting, crazy, tragic and frustrating all at the  same time.<br />At its worst, the book is pedantic, wordy, much too complex  and down right boring. Truly, this book is combination of the best and the  worst, sometimes right beside each other.<br />In the end though, I have to  agree with the critics over time, and that the classic pieces are what I  took with me in the end. The plight of Ahab, the fanaticism, the tragedy  and idea of an unobtainable goal all stay with me.<br />The material that  remains part of popular culture is there for a reason. The whole idea of a  &quot;white whale&quot; as the unobtained goal. &quot;Thar she  blows!&quot;, Captain Ahab himself, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; and many  more make the book worth everyone's effort to read at least once.	2000-06-27

The story starts slowly with a castle scullery boy named Simon who is a bit of a loser (they say Calfmoon, but it's the same thing) who  wanders around getting out of his duties in the kitchen and generally  goofing off. He doesn't do anything dramatic or exciting, in fact there is  an entire paragraph about him toying with a beetle he found in the  castle.<br />The characters are real and interesting, the images are crystal  clear. The pace is slow, but eventually accelerates when Simon gets mixed  in with the court wizard. Eventually, everything is moving along quickly  and into the second book, which is also well worth reading.<br />I found this  book entertaining, but frequently got reviews from friends who found it  slow and boring. It definitely is for people who enjoy long and winding  stories that introduce everthing slowly. If your typical fantasy is  dragonlance or forgotten realms (not bad, just a different style), you may  be dissapointed.	2000-06-27

However, when you need to translate a Japanese name or two, kanji will always come up. From me personally, it's for karate history.<br />I find this book excellent, especially when compared to the others of its type, especially when it comes to numbering the kanji. The indices into the kanji characters are intelligent, that is, they contain information about the kanji itself. As an example, character SHIN, meaning &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;soul&quot; has the index 4e5.1: 4 strokes for the radical (radical 4e), 5 strokes for the rest of the character. The Nelson just numbers sequentially and for the same character, you have #3245. This isn't to say that the Nelson is bad, but I feel that this dictionary is better thought out and more useful.	2000-06-27

All the Zen stories that I've heard over the years plus tons more are all presented here in cartoon form with short  explanations by someone (a cartoon zen master I presume) who is explaining  the story to a westerner.<br />One point that I have to make is how much more  of an impact this book had on me after I watched Joseph Campbell's video  series &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; . I read this book both before and  after I watched the videos and realized how much more they meant to me  afterwards and how great this book really is.<br />If you want to get even  more out of this book, check out the Campbell videos, you won't be sorry  that you did.	2000-06-14

There is also some information about old  kobujutsu masters like Aragaki, Matsumura, Sakugawa and  others.<br />Unfortunately, except for the cover, there isn't one old  photograph of Shinken Taira himself. Why not? What possible reason could  there be to not have ONE?<br />The writing is a little stiff, almost like a  transliteration rather than a translation and much of the information  included is just lists of members of Taira's organizations at various  points and their teaching ranks.<br />The old history of past masters is  limited, un-verified anecdotes mostly, and all very cursory  information,  not much useful detail with any sort of verification of where the  information may have come from. The translator certainly didn't add any of  this to the mix, which would have been nice.<br />Overall, the more I think  about it, even as I write this review, I realize that there's more bad than  good, which is why I give it a 2 star rating rather than a 3.<br />I would  only buy this book if you are a big kobudo practitioner or you are a die  hard karate and kobudo history nut. It came as a surprise to me that this  book was so unsatisfying, especially after reading &quot;Bubishi&quot;  which is an excellent book well worth your time.	2000-06-12

Since then however, there have been many excellent texts and articles, including some from the same author.<br />While  the kara descriptions are excellent, with good photography showing the  movements and how they should be done, the kata themselves are not  classical versions. They are rather versions taught by Richard Kim, which  don't always agree with the originals taught in Okinawa.<br />Also, there are  a fair number of incorrect historical references and incorrect translations  of kata names (and the kanji is not included either), making most other  current history books much more desireable.<br />This would only be a  &quot;must have&quot; book is you are in the lineage of Richard Kim and  want a kata reference, for which it would serve nicely.	2000-05-24

It is basically a history of the bubishi itself, but also gives an excellent overview of karate history in general, even though it is mostly previously known  information.<br />It goes further than most karate history texts, including a  good set of references about where the author found some of his  information.<br />This, along with &quot;Unante&quot; by John Sells is the  most read karate book in my library.<br />As for the actual Bubishi  translation, I have it on good authority that it is an excellent  translation from people who can read the original Japanese translation from  which this is taken.<br />I personally didn't find the Bubishi sections on  fighting and grappling particularly useful, but they do serve for good  historical perspective.<br />Some very useful sections from the book include a  glossary of terms with their kanji equivalents, something that I've found  very useful for translating lists of people's names, names of kata  etc...<br />The quality of the books is excellent, with very crisp, sharp  photos liberally distributed through the text and an excellent index.<br />I  do feel that this should probably rank high on most people's list of books  to buy, especially if you are starting out and are interested in karate  history.	2000-05-24

Except for a very few others, Funakoshi is the only early written information about karate and the earliest material that was translated into  English.<br />Unfortunately for myself and many others who study karate  history, Funakoshi never goes into much detail about much of anything. He  almost never gives a date and he rarely, if ever says where he learned any  of his kata or other practices.<br />The material on his teachers (Itosu and  Azato primarily) is in summary form, never mentioning more than anecdotes.  There are no dates, mentions of other students they had, what they taught  etc...<br />Over all, this kind of book is about real karate, certainly enough  to get a young mind going in the right direction about karate. It is well  written, we can probably thank the translator for that. It contains some  interesting material that is fun to read. Beyond that, it lacks detail to  keep you interested for long.<br />Most of Funakoshi's books are like this for  history. For the real meat of Funakoshi's karate (rather than this  introduction), take a look at &quot;Karate-do Kyohan&quot;, which contains  much more technical information.	2000-05-23

It has all the information in it to facilitate gathering software requirements for pretty much any IT project.<br />My problem with the book is the author's style, he just isn't very readable.  There is a lot of passive voice and not very many examples of the ideas he  presents. If there are examples, they tend to be collected at the back in  an appendix where they are much less useful than they would be directly  with the idea that needs an example.<br />I feel that the author settled for a  less than his best in this book, and frequently stops partway along a  direction that would have been much better if it were carried through more  fully.<br />There is a little bit of covereage of Entity Relationship Diagrams  (ERD), but he gives only a handful of examples and then immediately give a  diagram in a section with symbols that aren't covered in any of the  previous examples.<br />I was really looking forward to the function point  covereage, but function points are covered only marginally well in the  book, something that the author pretty much says himself in the first few  paragraphs of the chapter on function points.<br />The real strength of the  book is in the ideas, which I found very useful. The business event  approach is quite powerful and allows the breakdown of projects into  independant pieces. Also, the author gives &quot;tips&quot; on project  management on how to apply his methods. There are a number of tables and  diagrams for representing requirements that were also helpful.<br />A good  effort, but I feel that it could have been much better. All the ideas where  there, the author mentions them regularly, but just doesn't go all the way.	2000-05-19

There are some excellent poems, especially Browning and Shakespeare.<br />I did find out by reading this poetry collection that I'm just not a big fan of love  poetry. All the best is here, but except for four or five poems, it just  doesn't move me.<br />If you are a lover of romantic poetry however, you can  scarcely go wrong with this collection. It contains all the classics and  many more. The price is just right too, obviously not published by someone  out to make money, but by someone who wanted to share the poetry.	2000-05-19

Simplicity in writing style is something she shares with some of the genre's great writers like Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham.<br />I read her more popular  &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; simply  because they'd won awards, but found them a little dissapointing, probably  because they are both Nebula AND Hugo winners for their year and I was  expecting more.<br />This book, however, delivers exactly what I was  expecting, intelligent fantasy done just right. I appreciate the author's  ability to zoom in and out of the story without losing focus. She at some  times brings us down to a day by day, person to person level, but can  quickly zoom out and weeks or even years pass in a page or two. I found  that she picked just the right days in the life of the wizard to hold the  reader's interest and still gave the grand scheme of his life.<br />The next  two books were very good as well, but didn't capture the wonder of the  first. I love the way that LeGuin introduces the reader to the magic of  Earthsea, how the magic works and doesn't work etc...<br />This book is well  worth any Fantasy lovers time and energy.	2000-05-18

Basically, you should run your life the way that you would manage a project at work. You define what is required (your dream list), you plan a way ahead and you  check regularly to see if the plan is being followed. The biggest thing is  keeping track of what you've done so you can know if you are doing it  right.<br />The reason that I don't give this book 5 stars is that I realize  that some people don't really work this way and it's a little formal for  many people. Still, almost everyone should be doing something like this in  their life, whether it be a little less formal than what Givens suggests is  ok. The biggest deal is writing your plans down, otherwise, they are  immaterial vague entities that will probably never be realized without  luck.<br />Another thing that bugged me was Given's attempt to philosophize,  he shouldn't do that. One thing in particular that struck me was his  attempt at saying there is no such thing as &quot;trying&quot;, you've  either accomplished something or you haven't. Well, there's a reason that  there's a crime called &quot;attempted murder&quot;, it's because someone  &quot;tried&quot; to kill someone else.<br />Reguardless of this, Givens has  many, many excellent ideas on how you should dream and make those dreams  come true. He has obviously applied many of these techniques and presents  them clearly and unambigously in a way that anyone can read an apply. An  excellent self improvement title.	2000-05-15

If you liked this book, you'll probably like all of the Moorcock eternal champion series, Corum, Hawkmoon etc...<br />I just finished the first 3 books of Corum and really enjoyed  them. They reminded me a lot of this series.<br />What you can expect with  this series is a lot of action and a clean, clear writing style describing  some excellent ideas. Ideas of different worlds, interesting characters and  larger than life challenges by great heroes.<br />Another point, all 5 of the  first Elric books blur somewhat into one big long series of short stories  that are closely connected. I can never remember where all the pieces fit  except for the first and last books which are actually done as full  novels.<br />All in all, a great fantasy and I can highly recommend it.	2000-05-12

The ideas in this book just stream out endlessly, all interesting, all fun to read. Corwin is one of the siblings in the Royalty of Amber. Like any other set  of ambitious royalty, there are factions formed and leaders who squabble  for power.<br />The additional complexities of this set of royalty comes about  because they are immortal and from the center of the universe. They wander  the planes of the universe where everything is possible in among the  shadows of Amber (including Earth).<br />My favorite characters include  Benedict, the eldest remaining brother who has devoted his immortal life,  not to squabbling over the throne of Amber, but to the ways of war. His  mastery of sword-fighting, strategy and tactics and everything to do with  war is so refined that all the other siblings fear his abilities. He is  very cool.<br />Benedict spends his time wandering through shadow finding  Ceazar's, Napolean's etc.. great battles. Often, he will take charge of the  other side and see if he can turn the tide of the battle.<br />I re-read the  books just for Benedict's character.<br />The first few of the Merlin books  was just as good. Merlin creates Ghost, a computer capable of looking  through the shadow worlds.<br />I thought however, that the Merlin books ended  badly and were nowhere near on par with the first set. There was lots going  on for no reason, characters introduced needlessly and strategies thrown in  for no good reason in a mockery of an interesting plot.<br />Still, even with  the poor ending, the entire set is well worth your time. I can't say how  much I enjoyed the first 5 books, really the work of a master.	2000-05-12

The fantasy is fast paced and light and you can finish all of these books in very  little time.<br />The story: Corum is from a race of elf-like beings who have  ruled the world for thousands of years and have settled into their way of  life after centuries of peace with their life long enemies. Along comes  man, basically an animal compared to Corum's race of refined individuals.  Man is hardly a threat and mostly ignored. Well, centuries like this pass  and man rises in power and starts killing off other members of Corum's  people and finally they take notice.<br />Well set up, well executed and a lot  of fun to read.<br />If you liked Corum, you'll like the other eternal  champion books, I especially liked the Elric set, but enjoyed some of the  earlier Eternal Champion works including the first book on Erecose.	2000-05-12

I've used it as a reference for years, although I haven't read it through from beginning to end at any time.<br />So you want to know when Newton influenced physics and wrote his books? What  about Descartes? Arsitotle? It's all in there. It covers how knowledge was  created and spread throughout history.<br />This book seemed obviously  influenced by James Burke's &quot;Connections&quot; science series on TV. I  can't think of many better influences actually, as it was one of the best  learning series ever done for television.<br />Because of the small size of  the book, it's more of an overview than a super-detailed historic tome, but  I am always surprised at how much the author does cover. I've rarely found  a significant scientific or knowledge discovery/event that has been missed  in the text.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2000-05-10

I  just finished a project recently and found that I reference the book at  least on a daily basis.<br />This book is the definition of C and the exact  behaviour of the language.

Clarke book.<br />Clark is very strong on story and ideas, somewhat weak on character. Surprisingly enough, the somewhat flat characters doesn't diminish the story at all, as the wonder  of the alien spacecraft, its size and features are capivating in  themselves.<br />I find Clarke somewhat more polished in his writing than  Asimov and much less fomula based than Heinlein, but overall the three are  very similar.<br />If you like &quot;Rama&quot;, I suggest that you not bother  with the next volume in the set (Rama II), it isn't nearly as good and the  characters are obvious and uninteresting set in the same environment.	2000-04-26

The language is so clever and well used  that I'm sure that the translator probably deservers almost as much credit  as Lem does.<br />My favorite is the Electronic Bard who is asked to write a  poem: &quot;This is a poem about a haircut!

It definitely covers all of the technical aspects of project management, although in a very dry and uninteresting manner.<br />There is no coverage for specific  types of projects, only the principles of project management that cover  most projects most of the time and the PMI says as much in the book.<br />The  book also doesn't cover anything about handling difficult people or  manageing different personality types on a project, that's too much of a  soft area for this book.<br />I would recomment this only as a text book for a  course on PM. In that roll, it fits very nicely and makes sure that nothing  gets missed, while the teacher can fill in the softer material that is  absolutely necessary.<br />If you're looking for a book that will tell you  interesting anecdotes and statistics on projects done well versus those  done poorly and general pertinent guidlines for people on a  software/construction/human resources project, this isn't what you want.	2000-04-13

From the title, I expected more on the influence of White  Crane on karate, which is the art that I practice. There isn't much of  this, and the historical information on White Crane itself is a little  sketchy. Also, I was expecting more of the forms for comparison versus  karate kata, but this was not included in any detail.<br />This does not  negatively impact the book. While the book wasn't what I expected, it was  something that was extremely well done and useful to me.<br />The descriptions  of the flow of energy and where the energy is generated and how it passes  various joins and limbs is excellent. Never have I seen such detail  describing movement and stances as well as execution. I can't say enough  about Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming's writing style and inclusion of well organized  detail.<br />All of his scientific speculation is well backed up with many  references, not only to martial arts magazines and books, but to scientific  papers and reports. The thoroughness of the list of references astonishes  me every time I look it over.<br />This isn't the kind of book that you can  just glance over and absorb, it is the kind of book that you need to  dedicate a lot of time to in order to understand.

I am not a Uechi-ryu practitioner, but I recognize quality when I see it.<br />If others spent half the time organizing and  thinking about the material that they should include in their texts and how  they should display it, the quality of karate texts out there would improve  ten fold.<br />One thing that I've always admired about all of Mr. Mattson's  material is his temperance. In the 60's, when everyone was talking about  the amazing feats performed by karate masters, George Mattson was  describing real karate, as it really is, no embellishment and no  unnecessary flamboyance.<br />The writing style is clear and concise and all  of the information is relevant to developing solid karate form and  basics.<br />If there is a failing to the book, it's the exclusion of the  Sanseiru kata, which I thought should be included for completeness if  nothing else. I find that the photo seqences are good, but not intuitive  and it takes some effort on the part of the reader to understand how the  sequences are layed out.	2000-03-16

I was carrying on long discussions about it, the nature of the universe, the necessity of a quantumly random universe for  free will to exist at all and so on.<br />I was so happy to find Dennett's  book, and then I read it, I found myself shaking my head and complaining  out loud about its content. &quot;How can he say that? &quot;, or,  &quot;Come on, he can't be serious!&quot;.<br />For an example, Dennett  twists the definition of free will so far that he has it existing inside a  deterministic universe. Well, you don't have to think about it very long to  realize that free will can't exist in a deterministic unless you're talking  about a free will that is significantly different from what even the  introduction philosophy class tells you it is.<br />Dennett's argument centers  on the definition of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;will&quot; and ownership of  that will. He essentially make the semblance of free will the same as free  will through various examples and cases.<br />Another thing that Dennett said  in the book that I just couldn't get over was, &quot;the past doesn't  effect the future...&quot;. Of course the past effects the future, it's  called &quot;cause and effect&quot;. If you think about it, take a pool  table for an example, as soon as you strike the cue ball with the cue, the  outcome of where the balls go is determined. Even if you argue that quantum  mechanics makes the idea invalid (i.e. you could never predict the  outcome), it is nevertheless, the striking of the cue that effects what  happens from then on. Once the cue ball starts moving, the striking of it  is in the past, and is effecting the outcome. Therefore the past effects  the future.<br />Last, but not least, I was incredibly annoyed at Dennett's  references. He references, literally about 5 to 10% of every sentence he  writes. Great, he's well read and references thoroughly, but in the end, I  just kept thinking that Dennett couldn't actually think for himself.  Certainly, his conclusions on free will tell me that.the end, I  just kept thinking that Dennett couldn't actually think for himself.  Certainly, his conclusions on free will tell me that.	2000-02-03

Along with this book, there is is 4 volume set of Goju-ryu technical books that are great reference material. He obviously cares how he is perceived by people reading his work and takes  great care that his name is attached to only quality material.<br />What I  love about this book is that it is well written, very clear with a good  index. It is well organized chronologically and the pictures are actually  some that you haven't seen in other books and are interesting. There are  pictures of Miyagi that I haven't seen before, as well as pictures of turn  of the century China and Okinawa. It gives a great overview of how things  looked and a generally good feeling of how things must have been at the  time.<br />What I don't like about this book is that I find it biased in a few  different ways. Some may be intentional to make the Goju-ryu style more  historically and culturally significant that it actually is (not to say it  isn't, but there's no need to twist the truth over it). Others are simply  because of Higaonna's inexperience as a historian. He has done a lot of  first hand digging in China and around Okinawa to get direct accounts from  as many sources as possible. This is done well. The conclusions that he  draws from the reports that he has are a little shaky at times  however.<br />He will sometimes assert or dismiss a formerly accepted view  because his instructor &quot;would probably have told him if it were  true&quot; or &quot;the teaching of Tote was done in secret at the  time&quot; with no supporting evidence. It would be better to say that he  doesn't know, and leave it at that.<br />Despite these flaws, the book  contains a lot of new information that has been researched directly by the  author and people who worked with him. It represents a considerable amount  of effort that created a book well worth your time.	2000-02-03

He goes into archeological evidence of early stone weapons in the early parts of this book and then proceeds  through generations of royalty and the modern folk tales of weapons and Te  experts from the turn of the century.<br />Unfortunatly, there just isn't a  lot to talk about concerning these subjects. Much of the information,  especially 100+ years ago is difficult if not impossible to substanciate. I  thought that this was going to be another book like his first where he got  stories concerning Te and Kobudo and tried to sort through them by  comparisons between different masters. This isn't what the book is.<br />I  felt that there wasn't much substance to the book and I was much better off  with the Kobudo and Te section from his last book where he wandered from  dojo to dojo talking to masters about their styles. Certainly, that section  in &quot;Okinawan Karate&quot; was probably larger and certainly meatier  than this entire book, which was much too small and unsatisfying.<br />This is  for a die-hard amateur karate historians only. There are some facts (not  really fully referenced unfortunately) that aren't available elsewhere that  are worth looking at, but they could fit on just a couple of pages.	1999-12-20

They are clearly written for the most part and the author doesn't wander off too much. When I read them in high school, they were the best I had ever read, but looking back, I see  many flaws.<br />No matter, as pure escapism, they have everything most  fantasy readers want, fast paced action, likeable heros and a lot at stake  (the entire world in fact).<br />I like to compare them to Raymond Feist's  &quot;Rift War Saga&quot;, they came out at the same time, and fit the  ideas that I quoted in the last paragraph.

I still to this day, after years between readings  remember images I formed while reading the novel. Grass between the toes,  the nuclear wastes, the way the children formed telepathic images  etc...<br />One thing that I remember clearly is how the novel was like a  breath of fresh air, clean and smooth. There are no frilly edges and there  is no attempt by the author to make the book flashy. This makes the book  pure and adds to the impact of the story.<br />As an overview, there are a  group of children who are living in Eastern Canada after some type of  holocaust (this is never much of a point in the book... no one has memories  of it). Their society is strongly anti-mutant with a very strict set of  rules as to what is &quot;normal&quot; and what isn't. All of this children  are normal looking but are telepathic and form a click of just a small  number.<br />The book is their story of growing up and existing in this  paranoid and highly dogmatic society without being discovered and banished  or killed.<br />A definite classic in Science Fiction circles.	1999-12-16

Some say that it is GG Kay's best work. Personally, I don't feel that way, mostly because of the ending, which was a little too &quot;happily ever after&quot; fairy  tale-ish for me, after what was a pretty gritty fantasy novel, despite the  lyrical writing style of the author.<br />I've read everything before  &quot;Sailing to Sarantium&quot;, and found &quot;Tigana&quot; to be the  best, because of the pure plotting mastery and how all the threads came  together so beautifully and unpredictably at the end.<br />No matter, this is  an excellent book and Kay is a great writer and I'm sure that more  greatness is to come.<br />Another theme that I've noticed with Kay is his  migration from Fantasy to Historical Fiction. &quot;The Fionavar  Tapestry&quot; is completely and wildly fantasy, and &quot;Tigana&quot; was  as well to a point. &quot;Tigana&quot; was toned down somewhat, but then  &quot;A Song For Arbonne&quot; was almost completely magic-less, as was  &quot;The Lions of Al-Rassan&quot; that followed.

McCarthy<br />The biggest tragedy of this  publication is the lack of photos. I have seen several of Mr. McCarthy's  publications in the past and he usually includes an excellent collection of  old pictures. These are mostly absent in this text except for one place at  the end of the Miyagi Chojun section where all the photos were just lumped  together. I think that this was a problem with the the publisher, but  unfortunately, this still effects the quality of the book and hence my  rating.<br />Similar to volume 1, the book isn't the quality that I was  expecting. The number of small typing errors is just too high. One read  through and I found literally tens of errors of this kind.<br />Sticking to  criticizing the articles themselves, I have to say, for the large number of  references included in the text, there were a few that were missing that I  think should have been included. There was no reference to lots of Aragaki  material, including how Mr. McCarthy knew what kata were passed to Mabuni  from Aragaki and how he knew that Aragaki brought the Unsu kata from China,  or how we know that Aragaki corrected the Sochin kata that Mabuni  originally learned from Itosu Anko.<br />The last article should probably be  titled &quot;An introduction to the new karate vocabulary&quot; as Mr.  McCarthy wordily states what could be stated in far fewer words. I get the  feeling that as he publishes more and more, he feels the need to be wordier  and wordier. Strunk and White had it right when they said &quot;less is  more&quot;.<br />Overall, the book is a little inconsistant in giving  references, although I give it 3 stars because some of the information  isn't available elsewhere without a lot of digging.

For instance on page  10, Taira lists a group of well known kobujutsu masters and whether they  lived more than or less than 100 years ago. None of this was clarified in  the translation. Also, this very same information was included in an  article by Mr. McCarthy in Bugeisha magazine article but never credited  there to Taira Shinken, I don't know why.<br />The production quality isn't  quite what I've come to expect from Tuttle and Mr. McCarthy, the photos are  a little fuzzy and don't stand out as exceptional. Also, there are a quite  a few typing mistakes throughout the text. The numbering of the photos is  quite sub-standard and all of the photos are simply numbered sequentially  from 1 to 408, they don't match the kata numberings.

I only wish the kata that I am more interested in  were described in such clarity.<br />One complaint I have with the book, and  it's not really a complaint of Sugiyama and his students, more of a  complaint about Shotokan/JKA kata, it's just so picky on the angles that  you place your feet and hands and head etc... that it's infuriating. Not  only that, but it really becomes meaningless in terms of application, it's  just something that's always been done that way and nothing more. There  aren't any generalities on how to perform kata, just all the stikily  details.  Many karate styles and schools have become that way.<br />Having  said that, I still feel that descriptions of kata movements and directions,  pacings and strength are as good as any book on the market, much better  than photo descriptions simply because of the choice of line drawings and  specific notation rather than the traditional photographs and written  description.	1999-08-24

Some of Chitose Sensei's teachings coming from one  of his oldest students would have been fantastic reading. Hopefully Mr.  Bowerbank will include some of this in a future publication.<br /><br />  Some  of the other poorly presented material was the glossing over of karate  history in general which did nothing to eliminate some of the long standing  misunderstandings, even going so far as to show a cartoon of a karateka  kicking a samurai off a horse (something completely historically inaccurate  by the way).

I can't say that it went any further than that.<br /><br /> The next section reminded me very strongly of Plato's republic, as Takuan Soho went into the nature of the world as it is, which is very much seen through the lense of his understanding (16th century Japanese science I guess) which is sometimes ridiculous, and of limited use.<br /><br /> The third section is interesting, as he takes writing of various martial artists and interprets them or critiques them. This is useful for a modern martial artist, as we lack much of the historical and cultural context to interpret these directly from the translation. This section, along with the first are what makes the book worth reading. Still, I think that there are many more useful books out there for the martial artist to read before this one. Try Frederick Lovret's &quot;Way and the Power&quot;, or Sun Tzu's &quot;The Art of War&quot; or Musashi's &quot;A Book of Five Rings&quot;. All of these are much more useful.	1998-04-06

The points he make come up constantly when I practice and when I discuss what makes a martial artist good or bad. Read the book, no matter who you are or what your level, you'll take away vital information for your martial arts career.	1998-01-09

Uphoff Director, son of God, whatever, I don't know who this guy is, but he shouldn't be writing books. He can come up with titles of books, but he shouldn't flex his literary talent beyond that.<br />I was embarrassed to read this book, the author should definitely be embarrassed to have published it, there is a spelling mistake on the first page and all photographs (the few that are there) are 5th generation photocopies. There is no lineage of any katas beyond the person who taught the author and the &quot;journey through time&quot; refers to the author's learning of kusanku, not the kata's journey.<br />Believe me Mr. Uphoff, there are better ways to self publish.	1998-01-05

Here I am, the eternal skeptic, reading what seems to be a perfectly normal Ph.D thesis from a University of California Graduate student, and the next thing, I could be reading &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; with Don Juan substituded for Gandalf. AND, AND... the funny thing is, I really want to believe that it's true. Is there magic in the world? Real magic, not deja vue and spoon bending, I mean lightning bolts, teleportation and Dragons.

A friend of mine recommended that I read these books and I was sceptical. I read all 3 books in quick succession, amazed at how they kept getting better and better. I rate \\"The Wastelands\\" a 9 hoping against hope that Stephen King will pull it off again and get even better in the next installment. For that, I will gladly give a 10.	1997-10-01

I'm a huge fan of Donaldson, not only from his Tomas Covenant books, but from his much lighter &quot;Mordant's Need&quot; books.<br /><br /> His first go at science fiction was a sight to behold, an ugly and disgusting world where everything makes you wretch and everyone is your enemy. All of the characters have huge flaws and proceed along paths that I can't imagine any sane person taking. I hated everyone in the book, and felt sorry for them at the same time. I couldn't read any more. If that's what Donaldson was attempting, I applaud him, but I won't read any more of these books.	1997-10-01

She just ended up making the characters look stupid. These people are ultra-intelligent, demi-god like characters, yet they ended up acting like a bunch of dumb, little kids, no intrigue, no slick plots, just &quot;the biggest brain wins&quot; period.	1997-10-01

Then, I found out that the book wasn't going to be a continuation of the first... ok, a downer, but hey - it still might be good!<br /><br /> Of course, this was wishful thinking and the book went completely downhill from about the halfway point. The ending was the worst, it seemed like Mr. Brin was just getting close to a deadline at this point, and the whole novel practically crumbled to dust and blew away in the wind.<br /><br />I gave this book a 6 out of 10 because of the first half of the book, which I truly enjoyed.	1997-10-01

While most fantasies have magicians and all kinds of magical creatures, Mr. Russell decided to concentrate on people, and not only that, he decided to concentrate on INTERESTING people. This, I wish to impress, is a rare occurance in fantasy novels where the spells or the dragon or the magic sword are usually the bread and butter.<br /><br /> The last fantasy that was this original was probably &quot;Seventh Son&quot; in the Tales of Alvin Maker series by Orson Scott Card.	1997-09-30

There is generally good coverage of the kata, although there could be more description immediately with the photographs. Certainly, this is one of the best books of it's kind available and there should be more like it. I was a little surprised that the book had so little history (only a few pages). For a direct student of Kian Chotoku, history should be the strongest part of the book	1997-08-18

When science fiction writers were still fumbling with aliens from mars, Stapledon was examining the nature of humans billions of years into the future. Odd John is one of the first appearances of the so called &quot;second man&quot;, humans as we know them being &quot;first men&quot;. John is the next evolutionary step and to him, we all seem like apes. Stapledon picked his hero (anti-hero?) perfectly and told it from just the right perspective. One of my favorite books ever	1997-06-17
