The characters were realistic and visual.  The author has a great way of teasing your senses and putting your emotions on edge. She draws you in.  In addition to the sensualness that abounds the novel, the author also offers a bit of mystery to keep you guessing. I have to admit that I thought I had it figured out, but found out I was wrong in the end.  This was a very good read and I highly recommend it.	2005-08-29

After hearing so much hearsay through the years, it was extremely interesting to read her first hand accounts of the inner workings of the party, her life, and inside the world of Huey P. Newton.  Some details were long while others left questions and the longing for further insight, especially about her departure and the circumstances afterwards. But overall, I felt that this was a very worthy read to learn about and understand one of the most controversial organizationsof that time.	2005-07-11

She shows how she was shaped and molded into a revolutionary and brings forth how most revolutionaries were created.  I also found her commentaries on the Black Movement insightful and thought-provoking.  After reading her autobiography, I also did a little research to get the point of view of the other side.  What I did find interesting where points that actually collaborated with Assata's claim that she could not have been the shooter.  Also interesting was that the reports of those against her for this particular incident varied and were  inconsistent.  All in all, Assata's autobiography gives an up-front and personal look at the etreme and blatant practices of racism at that time and how the oppressed reacted to it.	2005-06-30

In the beginning, Baldwin shares how he (and a lot of minorities) come into knowing racism as a child growing up.  A lot of what he shared I can remember feeling or questioning when I was growing up.  Baldwin also analyzes the solution proposed to end racism and also gives his opinion on what it would take for all races to actually achieve total equality amongst all.  Even today, this book makes you look deeper into this issue and at the people involved and why we all act and react the way we do.  Only after understanding can we begin to apply valid solutions.  This book should be read by everyone.	2005-06-25

The community was real and could be felt in their tightness and togetherness.  You've sensed this in reality before.

Malcolm X shared with us his beginnings, starting with his own parents and their experiences with the racial injustices of their time. Malcolm X then takes us through his mind as a youngster and shows us his conformance to the social times, his downfall, and later, his adherance to his mission.  This book is filled with the passion that Malcolm X felt for his people and how he had planned to fight for them until the death, which he did, even if it meant going against the very ones that showed him the light. This is a very powerful and life-altering read.  Masterfully written, this is a definite must read.  I highly recommend reading this memoir.	2005-06-14

The author was able to get me to put my own personal feelings aside and get caught up in the realistic characters and storyline.  Overall, the story had good flow.

But unfortunately, I couldn't get through the attacks, grossly exaggerated opinions with no facts, and the reliance upon TV, movies, and plays to prove points.  Unfortunately for me, I guess, my background is in science and techology and I don't spend a lot of time watching TV and therefore, couldn't relate to many of his examples and analogies. But regardless, I find it difficult to rely on fiction for truth in reality.  I do plan, however, to find other voices on this topic who can address this issue without attacks and with valid data or situations.  This author does present a great overall theme.	2005-04-24

I wondered if there were teenaged girls who actually thought and behaved this way and I'm afraid that the answer may really be a resounding yes.  Sister Souljah laid out a story that showed a generation, a lifestyle, the highs and lows of it, and the consequences.  She brought you into that world.

While reading this memoir, I was engaged, repulsed, seeking further understanding, and more.  So many emotions were brought forth.  Eldridge Cleaver provided us with insight to the soul of a complex man during a time of turmoil.  While I may not have agreed with some of the things he had to share, I appreciated being able to look at social issues during that time period from his perspective.  It's harsh, it's gripping, and it was his reality.  Cleaver conveyed his feelings and views of society with such clarity and emotion that it certainly allows you to step inside of his mind and see from his perspective how it was to be black at that time...whether you agree or not, it certainly provokes reflection.	2005-03-14

I browsed through a few books at the bookstore and do believe that this was the best choice of the books available on the shelf that day.  As a female total beginner who has only ridden on the bakc of bikes, I found the general information on the types of bikes, and general structure and components, motorcycle maintenance most useful.  I'm quite sure the information on riding techniques will help me in training and during the skills test.  The only information that I pretty much skipped was the beginning where the author discusses a son's choice in buying a bike and talking him out of it.  Also, the detailed information on classic bikes, and used bikes, (bikes that a beginner is not likely to buy) perhaps would have been better as an Appendix.  But I remember a section like that in a lot of the beginner books I browsed and would suspect that the experienced motorcycle enthusiasts just can't help themselves and want to share the joy (I'm sure I'll reach that point when I become that knowledgeable about these beautiful machines).  All in all, I thought this was a great written introduction to read while waiting for spring to arrive.	2005-02-05

I love his ability to go outside of the box, or book in this case, and write different types of stories.  I found this one as enjoyable as TP.  EJD weaved an awesome plot and told a new story.  I enjoyed the way he uses new technology to bring freshness to a story.  His believable and well developed characters and their situations were fresh and new.  His descriptions and and the way he slowly unfolds facts to reveal truths are awesome.  I have much respect for his writing and applaud his ability to step out and offer different stories while applying new writing techniques every time.	2004-09-13

Great character development and awesome use of description and senses to pull the emotions right off the pages.  And his writing style is just superb.

Fitzgerald's writing is very exquisite, full of imagery and his mastery of language is awesome.  I found myself reading sentences twice.  Not for understanding, but because I loved them so much I had to read it again.  And the story...Gatsby.  Such a sad reflection of what is known as the American Dream.  Touching and thought provoking.  Excellent read!  Truly awesome!	2004-08-18

I loved it because it was a true to life story and each character seemed as real as can possibly be.

It was very insightful in showing how simple words implanted in us as children can drive and have an effect on even the most minute situations in our lives.  It seemed that because of words and views planted by her mother, even the most innocent of situations was turned into a color issue, whether one may have seen that as justified or not.  It was her reality.  While as a brown skinned black female, I may not have experienced the same thing or thought the same way, nor can I say that I grew up the same, so I cannot negate her feelings or experiences.  So although I did not feel that I could personally relate, this book provided insight on how color issues can affect others.	2004-08-16

I'm quite surprised that a story about a fish could have me wrapped up and engaged.  This was my first Hemingway book and I enjoyed his simple storytelling style. Because it was straight forward, I was able to get into the old man's dilemma of not having caught a fish in months and then battling with this great marlin, only to have it attacked by sharks.  I like that I was able to get into and feel his struggles within his mind and against his body.  This was a very engaging classic.	2004-07-05

US	33850436	R3JRIBVV9D0WB0	0743244559	203569523	Dating Games: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A PLOT TO CALL HOME ABOUT	RM Johnson's latest novel, Dating Games is an exciting plot driven urban novel that is sure to keep readers turning the pages.  Johnson successfully manages to intertwine love, family relationships, guns and drugs into an action love thriller.<br />Dating Games brings you into the world of the Rodgers family.  Mother Livvy wants more out of her life than her current job as a nurse's assistant and has a hard time finding and developing meaningful relationships with men.  Her twin daughters, Hennessey and Alize are total opposites of each other and each has her own issues with men and relationships that are reflective of her personality.  RM brings these characters together with the loves of their lives and creates a story full of suspenseful drama.  Livvy battles to rid her life of a toxic sore of a man while trying to preach about good relationships to her daughters.  While Hennessey and Alize do find her advice amusing, considering the source, they do come to understand her words of wisdom better after tragedy strikes.  Livvy is also forced to take a look at herself in respect to the advice she is dishing out as well as the fragile relationship between her and her daughters.<br />RM Johnson has drawn well rounded characters that readers can see from the beginning to the end of their dilemmas. Younger readers may be able to identify with the choices of the teenaged daughters and mature readers will be able to sympathize with the journey of Livvy.  Even though his straight forward tell-tell style may not give the reader the feeling of being there, his mastery of controlling and driving the plot to a dramatic end will definitely make up for any possible losses.<br />In Dating Games, RM Johnson shows a highly skilled talent of piecing together a strong plot to create energy and suspense.  I highly recommend this novel for readers who enjoy urban love stories with a thriller of a twist.	2004-02-18

Often times childhood resentments between siblings, cousins, and even childhood friends can carry over into adulthood and plague our lives forever.  That's exactly what it can do, unless we learn as adults to forgive.  Roses are Thorns shows us how forgiveness can be a hard thing, but how good it can be once we free ourselves of such burden.<br />Shelia Goss does a wonderful job breaking rules and doing it perfectly as she uses third and first person fluidly throughout the story.  It is craftily told in alternating and non-repetitive voices between the sisters and you are able to understand their innermost thoughts as situations arise.  The refreshing new voice explored in Roses are Thorns, Violets are True will definitely entertain you.	2003-12-03

From the moment that Lily expressed her hestiation to Alex because of his age, I was yelling, \\"Go on, girl.  Get yours!\\", but that's just me.  Bloom takes you inside the mind of Lily as she struggles to control her feelings for a much younger man.  You learn and experience her insecurities and view her concerns that stem from her surrounding environment.<br />Linda Dominique Grovenor's writing style is engaging as usual, and she pulls you into the story with her words.  The flow is smooth and the tone is mellow.  It was great and refreshing to read a calm novel that offered an alternative to all the high drama novels that are available.  <br />I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend this one for those cold winter nights in front of the fireplace!	2003-11-16
