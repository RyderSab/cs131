US	30081986	R1HV5JVLTMCPG0	0140449892	962236503	The Rig Veda (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	120	136	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Penguin's New Packaging	This is a re-issue, in Penguin's current format, and with new cover art, of the Penguin Classics volume previously listed by Amazon as \\"The Rig Veda: An Anthology of One Hundred Eight Hymns,\\" published in 1981 (and as of October 2005, confusingly still available from Amazon), as translated and edited by Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty. That was her married name, since dropped, to the accompaniment of endless bibliographic and bookselling confusion. She is now known as Wendy Doniger, and is the \\"Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions\\" at the University of Chicago. (She has reported receiving mail with interesting combinations of names and titles.)    Upon inspection, the \\"new edition\\" is revealed to be one of Penguin's cosmetic re-packagings to make the whole line uniform (and mostly quite handsome), and not one of the revised editions which have also been appearing as part of the same project. I offer here, with some modifications, my review of the 1981 edition (itself previously reissued in a larger format, with new cover art, some years ago, but also not otherwise changed).    Meanwhile, I suggest trying the Amazon page for the older edition of \\"The Rig Veda: An Anthology...\\" if you are interested in a variety of responses by over a dozen other reviewers. And, again, don't let the title and name variations suggest that they are different books, of exactly the same length, from the very same publisher! (As a matter of fact, the actual front-cover title of these editions has been just \\"The Rig Veda\\" all along.)     Under any form of her name, Wendy Doniger is a distinguished interpreter and translator of Vedic and classical Sanskrit texts, and of Indian religions in general. Her books are often witty, and at times quite dense with detail. She fully appreciates the playfulness of many versions of Hindu stories of the gods. (\\"Play\\" being in fact an explicit theme in some of them.)      In this volume she presents a selection of very ancientpoems, in quite readable translations, and backs them up with detailed interpretive and bibliographic notes. It is a first-rate introduction to a very difficult body of literature, which, like the Bible and the Koran, is held sacred by a very large number of people. It is an intriguing and attractive look at the hymns and songs of ancient India, although this volume is at best an adjunct to an appreciation of the living religion, which certainly regards The Four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva) as its basic canonical texts, but looks very different indeed to outsiders from the ancient beliefs and practices in archaic Sanskrit.    Unfortunately, like the Koran, the Vedas are traditionally memorized, recited, cited, and sometimes explained, but not translated, which makes this book religiously problematic. Turning the mystical sounds of Sanskrit into readily intelligible words seems to strike some as sacrilege. At best, devotional readings are the only acceptable renderings. To the apparent distress of some true believers, Wendy Doniger tries to reconstruct what the poems meant when they were first recited, mainly (according to the early Sanskrit supplementary texts, the Brahmanas and Aranyakas) to accompany rituals; although some seem to have had other contexts.    This is not their meaning to present-day Hindus, over three thousand years later, which would be an interesting topic in itself; but two of the other four canonical Vedic Samhitas (collections) are verses of the Rig Veda arranged for such liturgical use, so the attempt to apply this information to the poems is not some strange leap in logic by foreigners. Nor is the rigorous use of comparative grammar and analysis of sound-changes -- this was a science which really can be said, quite fairly, to have been learned by Europeans from the Sages of India, even if they have applied it in unexpected and non-traditional ways.    Now, this is exactly what critical scholarship is supposed to be about. Anyone who finds in it a specific bias against Hinduism might take a close look at an issue of, say, \\"The Journal of Biblical Literature.\\" Christians and Jews having been doing this sort of thing with their own sacred texts for a couple of hundred years (actually, although sporadically, rather longer).     Now, I haven't studied Sanskrit. But I *have* compared her versions of a number of famous hymns to earlier English translations, to relatively recent treatments of passages in academic journals, and to transliterated Sanskrit texts (and also citations and variants outside the Rig Veda, traced in the digital version of Bloomfield's \\"Vedic Concordance\\"), and even to the highly regarded German translation by Geldner (not a lot of help for me there...). I found that her renderings tend to be a bit sparse, or at least concise, compared to most, but she uses headnotes and end notes to fill up gaps by explaining implications, instead of interpolating extra words or phrases to make clear her understandings of passages.    So I can't agree that she is willfully misrepresenting the originals.    No, I think that the main problem with the volume, as the translator would probably acknowledge, is that it will leave the (non-devotional) reader hungry for more. There are only 108 (a sacred number) out of a canon of 1,028. She chose some of the most attractive poems, including most of the famous ones, and presented them in language free of late-Victorian pseudo-Biblical idioms. Although sometimes (not always) too formal to be truly colloquial -- we are, after all, looking at formal compositions, many very clearly ceremonial! -- they are hardly in what Hank Heifetz (a co-winner of the Ramanujan Book Prize for Translation of South Asian Languages) has called \\"Indologese,\\" either.    Unfortunately, most of the other English versions, and all of the more-or-less complete ones, belong to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and, besides these literary faults, are a century or so out of date; although still reprinted, even (or especially) in India. The e-book \\"Rig Veda\\" offered by Amazon from digiread may be the R.T.H. Grifffith translation of 1889, revised in 1896. The Kessinger e-book is Griffith's version, and, as I have described in a separate review, has the complete hymns, with some passages relegated by the translator to an appendix, but it omits the translator's valuable running notes. There was a one-volume Book-of-the-Month Club edition of it in 1992, with both all of the hymns and notes, and some appendices but apparently without some of Griffith's other apparatus; see \\"Hinduism: The Rig Veda (Sacred Writings)\\" by Ralph T.H. Griffith for the Amazon listing.  (One hopes the digireads version isn't the incomplete H.H. Wilson rendering, the first installments of which are from 1850!)    Readers without Sanskrit, like me, can neither rely upon these and other old translations, nor easily find corrections for specific passages. Many pieces that aren't included in this Penguin selection are only too likely to be missed by those of us who have seen references to particular hymns, and would like to have a better idea of what they are about. But I'm grateful to have what is here.	2005-10-05
US	30081986	R317YU4ZMSLB78	0062507761	356569496	The Original New Testament: A Radical Translation and Reinterpretation	Books	5	47	48	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Interpreting and Re-Interpreting	An earlier version of this translation was published as \\"The Authentic New Testament: Edited and Translated from the Greek for the General Reader,\\" in Great Britain by Dobson in 1955, with a paperback from Panther, and reissued in the United States in a Mentor Paperback from New American Library in 1958  (478 pages in very small print). It preceded by a decade Hugh J. Schonfield's controversial bestseller \\"The Passover Plot: New Light on the History of Jesus\\" (1965; just reissued in A Special Fortieth Anniversary Edition) and its sequel \\"Those Incredible Christians\\" (1968), which I tend to see as the outlines and documentation for a set of brilliant, but unfortunately unwritten, novels about Jesus and the early Church. The translation followed and accompanied a number of earlier, much less sensational, books on the origins of Christianity.    (For Schonfield's life, and his interesting but often odd views on both Judaism and Christianity, see \\"Passing Over the Plot? The Life and Work of Hugh Schonfield (1901-1988)\\" by Richard Harvey, available online in a pdf of \\"Mishkan\\" 37 for 2002; the orientation is very much \\"mission-to-the-Jews,\\" but the information seems sound.)     The revised edition was published in 1985 with the new title of \\"The Original New Testament: A Radical Translation and Reinterpretation\\" (Waterstones in the U.K. and Harper & Row in the U.S.). It was reissued in an Element Books paperback edition in 1998 with the less happy apparent subtitle (on the cover) of \\"The First Definitive Translation of the New Testament in 2000 Years,\\" which isn't what Schonfield claimed it to be. (I suspect a publicity statement or blurb got \\"promoted.\\") At this writing, all editions are out of print, although the Harper printing seems to be fairly readily available on Amazon through dealers. The 1985 edition was updated, and in much more legible print than the old mass-market paperback, but some useful features (see below) were dropped. (It still runs to 594 pages, notcounting the 34-page Introduction.)    Schonfield's is a strikingly interesting approach, highly personal, but well-informed, like Richmond Lattimore's contemporary translations (1962-1982; collected as \\"The New Testament,\\" 1996); although Lattimore, a classical scholar, avoided both theology and history in favor of reflecting Greek style. Schonfield is certain to infuriate some people, and to annoy almost every reader at one point or another; but the translation and commentary are never dull, and despite glossing over some issues as too boring for the General Reader, mostly reliable as to facts, if not conclusions. (One sometimes has to read carefully to tell the difference.)    The translation was not originally undertaken to support Schonfield's decidedly quirky \\"take\\" on Jesus (whose career he later interpreted as that of an apocalyptic messianist, who stage-managed a \\"Scripture-fulfilling\\" confrontation with Rome), but to present the lay reader with two then (circa 1950) less familiar ways of approaching the New Testament; as Greek texts whose contents and order are less securely established than official translations would suggest, and as the products of Jewish communities, not yet clearly differentiated into \\"The Early Church.\\"    As for the first, it still seems to be new and shocking to some to think of the New Testament as a set of writings with a complex manuscript history. Although this fact is not very obviously reflected in the standard, ecclesiastically-sponsored translations, which smooth over most such difficulties, particularly those popular printings with minimal textual notes, fuller editions make this clear (the Catholic \\"New Jerusalem Bible,\\" for example, is available in study versions, with elaborate references to variants, and simplified presentations for the \\"ordinary reader\\"). There is a substantial body of scholarship which has attempted to figure out how the text reached its present state, not to be confused with historical speculationsabout \\"what really happened.\\"    As part of offering a non-standard presentation, emphasizing unexpected and \\"difficult\\" variants, Schonfield often disregards traditional divisions, introduces new ones, separates out some passages as secondary elaborations, and shifts others from their accustomed places. He substitutes a reconstructed chronological order for the somewhat arbitrary arrangement in most printed texts. (The manuscript evidence on this is somewhat chaotic, and the usual order is a convention that lacks the authority assumed by many readers.)    The original \\"Authentic New Testament\\" edition contained a finding table for converting King James Version references to page numbers; a helpful feature dropped in the revised edition. The introduction of a somewhat better, but still not completely satisfactory, indication of the standard chapter and verse numbers is not a full substitute. The omission of the original \\"Index of Persons and Places,\\" and the replacement of the \\"Index of References\\" with a \\"Bibliography of Antique Sources Employed,\\" are also regrettable.    Schonfield often looks like he is merely imposing his own preferences on someone else's sacred texts, but he claims that many of his variations can be traced quite readily in the apparatus to a critical Greek New Testament. I've used his versions for years alongside a 1960 pocket-size printing of Nestle and Aland's \\"Novum Testamentum Graece\\" (1924), which was probably among the (unspecified) editions he used, and found that he does, indeed, often reflect specific manuscript evidence, and offers resolutions to real problems. (I've also compared it to the 1966 \\"The Greek New Testament\\" of Aland, Black, Metzger, and Wikgren, and occasionally to other critical texts.)    In other cases, such as his treatment of the Pauline Epistles, he drew on existing theories about their structure and compilation. I am less happy about this, for, although some of the suggestions look plausible, I can't imagine how we can know for sure that, for example, a given canonical epistle is stitched together from several discrete letters, and was not dictated in several sittings instead.    There is interesting evidence for such practices of repackaging in the letters among the so-called Apostolic Fathers, another set of very early Christian writings, which Schonfield cites; too bad he didn't add a translation of some of those works, as well, illustrating the approach with less sensitive materials. (There is a recent bilingual Loeb Classical Library edition of these texts, which have lately come in for renewed attention. They should not be confused with Christian apocrypha, such as non-canonical Gospels and Acts, which Schonfield also draws on for evidence.)    Some of Schonfield's re-arrangements, such as shifting Revelation 1:8 to follow 1:3, make excellent literary sense (in this case rounding off one passage more neatly and allowing the next to conclude with \\"Amen\\"), but don't seem to have any other justification. But trying to \\"restore\\" the logic of apocalyptic writings, which tend to describe themselves as dreams, is not a failing confined to Schonfield.    His clustering of at least nominally related materials (Luke with Acts, the Johannine Epistles with the Gospel and Revelation) is actually helpful. His separation of Hebrews (as \\"Homily on the High Priesthood of Christ\\") from the letters of Paul will not surpise anyone aware of the literary and linguistic problems the attribution presents, but may offend those unaware that the conventional \\"The Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews\\" in many editions follows not the sacred text, but a tradition already questioned in the early Church.    The second feature is offering the New Testament as a set of documents written by Jews, for other Jews, but read, and usually misunderstood, by non-Jews who have brought to it centuries of misconceptions. From my point of view, the great weakness of this approach, when applied to the accepted Christiancanon, is that it takes for granted the relatively early dates and generally non-gentile context of (almost) the whole corpus -- which I think is what needs to be demonstrated for some portions. It is one of points on which Schonfield is closest to traditional Christian views!    Schonfield attempts to clear away what he regards as confusion about what Jesus and Paul (in particular) were talking about by resorting to Jewish texts, mostly the Hellenistic and traditional Rabbinic sources mined by scholars since the nineteenth century, with additional light from the Pseudepigrapha, originally Jewish (probably) works involving \\"Old Testament\\" characters which have survived, for the most part, only in Christian translations. He also drew on the emerging documentation offered by the Dead Sea Scrolls, so far as they had been published.    (These texts have turned out to include fragments of Hebrew and Aramaic versions of some of the Pseudepigrapha, supporting some but not all of Schonfield's suggestions, but these were mostly published too late for Schonfield to make much use of them.)    He was conversant with halacha (Jewish law and practice) and midrash (homiletic exposition of scripture) and non-Biblical aggadah (story-telling), and drew on them constantly; not unprecedented, except that most Christian writers through the first half of the twentieth century had been very much concerned to \\"prove\\" either the superiority of Christianity or the blindness of \\"the Jews,\\" and often rather worried about undermining Christian theological readings of the allusions they were explicating. Back in 1986, at least one reviewer of the Harper edition suggested that Schonfield was taking sides in an inner-Christian dispute over the proper form of Baptism. I don't see it that way.    Schonfield, simply unconcerned over whether baptism should be *carried out* by sprinkling or by immersion (which is what might be called Christian halacha), cheerfully pointed out that John the Baptist must, contextually, be John the Immerser. Ritual immersion in \\"living water\\" for purification was, and is, a Jewish practice. The only remotely relevant sprinkling ritual, with water in which the ashes of a red heifer have been dissolved, was for exposure to a dead body, and was associated with the Jerusalem Temple, not wandering preachers, and a special category of contagious impurity, not repentance for sins. The public reaction to John suggests that he was adapting something familiar, not offering a strange innovation. No suggestions are offered by Schonfield on how, or even whether, this information should inform practice.     I can see the reviewer's problem; the application is a living issue for some Christians. But offering a simple explanation from Jewish practice and theory at points where Christians have spent almost two millennia fighting over complex ones drawn from doctrine does have its attractions.    On the Jewish side, Schonfield's treatment has some problems. On the one hand, he (very properly) discussed the astonishing variety of Judaisms co-existing in Roman times, and tried to reconstruct the messages of Jesus and Paul to fit among them. On the other, he tended to cite the modern \\"traditional\\" Jewish prayer-book as if it clearly reflected First Century liturgical practices. The antiquity of both the whole service and specific formulations in it are open to debate; some is clearly ancient, large portions are definitely medieval, some sections later still. One would have to read very closely indeed to gather that from Schonfield. (Shelby Spong, an Episcopal Biship, fell into a similar trap in 1996 in his \\"Liberating the Gospels: Reading the Bible with Jewish Eyes.\\" He there tries to explain the structure of the Gospel narratives as originally linked to a Synagogue reading cycle of Scripture, which, alas, is not securely dated itself.)      Given the actual post-Christian date of most of the texts Schonfield was working with, this is only an extreme example of the problem. As mentioned earlier, he acknowledged this in general in his introduction, but declined to offer detailed explanations of his conclusions in particular cases, which, he explained would be too long and tedious. He was probably right about that, but, unfortunately, he doesn't seem to have gone into the matter in detail in his other books on early Christianity (mostly out of print), either.	2005-10-02

US	30081986	R3D6R9J99I7FI3	B0008895PU	410000627	The facetious nights of Straparola	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Story-telling Revisited (Once Again)	Anyone out there interested in the original mid-sixteenth-century Italian text of this work, as “Le piacevoli notti,” by Giovan Francesco Straparola, can find an inexpensive Kindle text under that title, and that form of the author’s name. It is based on a 1927 edition of the text, apparently with some claims to being critical, but I have no knowledge of how good the edition is considered to be, and certainly no way of judging the transference of the text to Kindle format. (There are no obvious OCR artifacts in the first few pages, anyway, which is a good sign.  However, my review, despite many digressions on other editions, and even other collections, is of a Kindle edition of an English translation.  Staparola’s work is notable for, among other things, providing our first published evidence for a number of European “Fairy Tales,” some dramatically different from better-known versions, although still quite recognizable.  The translation by W.G. Waters now being reviewed originally appeared in two volumes in 1894, as just &#34;The Nights of Straparola&#34;  with illustrations by E. R. Hughes, from Lawrence and Bullen (London). Under the title of &#34;Facetious Nights&#34; it was re-issued, apparently with some changes and additional illustrations, by “The Society of Bibliophiles” as a four-volume set, the dates of which I have seen given variously as 1901-1902 and 1908-1909. The copy I used to own was undated, and I don't know if either date is correct, or whether they represent an extended publication of the different volumes. It also might record the issuing of the books in slightly different formats (binding and selection of illustrations).  The title has been rendered in various other ways, including &#34;Pleasant Nights&#34; and &#34;Most Delectable Nights,&#34; which indicate incomplete (and apparently not very reliable) translations. The title, in any translation, refers to a story-telling competition, held over a series of evenings, on the obvious model of the then already-classic &#34;Decameron&#34; of Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1350).  The “Nights of Straparola” two-volume edition is available in PDF format (and others) from the Internet Archive (archive.org), and so, separately listed, is the four-volume “Facetious Nights” version. In the latter case, the Archive seems to offer examples of different “issues” of the edition, with and without color illustrations besides the black-and-white ones by Hughes. There are some other complications in the listing of the latter version, which I will deal with below.  The Waters translation, as it appeared in the “Society of Bibliophiles” edition, is that used in the present Kindle edition of “The Facetious Nights.” I have not gone through the massive file for accuracy of transference of the text into this format, but spot-checks on that have been encouraging. Unfortunately, there is no sigh of Waters’ interesting “Terminal Essay” on the stories, their sources, and later versions.  A problem I *have* noticed is the lack of a table of contents, linked or not. This is a huge work, and finding things in it can be hard. The Kindle search function should let you find a story for which you have a title, or a character’s name (or a location like “Fourth Night, Fifth Story”) but you have to have that information when you start looking. The Kindle edition also includes some of the illustrations (how many I am not sure). The Waters translation did include a pretty good tables of contents for each volume, summarizing the stories for each night. It may be a little hard to find in the PDF versions: I have seen them placed at both the front and the end of the volumes.  Those who are curious about the illustrations by various hands, or want to sample the stories before committing themselves to either the Kindle or a PDF version, may wish to Google the SurLaLune Fairy Tales website for an html version of the “Bibliophiles” edition. This also includes Waters' &#34;Terminal Essay.”  Those interested in just a selection, in a more modern translation, together with related tales from early collections through to the Grimms in the early nineteenth-century, and who are not intimidated by another thick (991 pages) volume, should take a look at &#34;The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm&#34; a Norton Critical Edition (2001), edited by Jack Zipes, a considerable authority on the subject.  As for the translation (the point which I’m sure you’ve been waiting for!), the English rendering by W.G. Waters (William George Waters, 1844-1928) is readable, although in my opinion a bit wooden. However, a slightly older version, by no less than the flamboyant explorer-translator Sir Richard Francis Burton, turned the author's once up-to-date Italian into archaic-sounding English for no apparent reason or literary gain, so bland modernity (as of the Victorian era) may be a blessing in disguise.  (Burton's approach seems to have worked somewhat better with a translation of a later story-cycle, published as “Il Pentamerone, or The Tale of Tales” (1893), by Giambattista Basile. The Italian was not standard — Basile used the Neapolitan rather than the Tuscan form of the language, which gave Burton some excuse to experiment with the English. N.M. Penzer's 1932 rival translation, by way of Benedetto Croce’s translation of Basile into modern standard Italian, criticizes Burton, and, indeed, his rendering is considered more precise, but it is also accused of &#34;ennobling&#34; the prose style; including following Croce’s bowdlerizations of the racy original. There is now a superior, and complete, translation of Basile’s collection, as “The Tales of Tales,” by Nancy L. Canepa, originally published by Wayne State University Press in 2007, and now available from Penguin Classics. It also includes excellent annotations, which are needed, given allusions to, for example, Sicilian customs a modern readers can’t be expected to know about. Possibly someone is working on a new translation of Straparola on similar lines.)  The author of “The Facetious Nights” is identified in some reference works as Giovan Francisco Straparola (ca. 1480-1558), with various spellings, and nothing very certain is known about him. He may have been born in the village of Caravaggio, near Bergamo in the territory of Milan, and &#34;Straparola&#34; may be nickname indicating a wordy style. He seems to have spent his adult life in Venice.  According to the description in the Waters translation: &#34;'The Facetious Nights of Giovanni Francesco Straparola' consists of an Exquisite and Delightful Collection of Humorous, Witty and Mirthful Conversations, Fables and Enigmas Including Singing, Music and Dancing During the Thirteen Nights of the Carnival at Venice as Related by Ten Charming and Accomplished Damsels and Several Nobles, Men of Learning, Illustrious and Honorable Gentlemen of Note at the Entertainments of Merriment and Pleasure Given by the Princess Lucretia at Her Beautiful Palace at Murano.&#34; (I have not been able to locate the original of this in the Kindle Italian text — which elsewhere gives “Merano” instead of “Murano” — so I am not sure whether or not this is Waters’ own period-style title-page “blurb,” or comes from one of the many Italian editions.)  We are further informed concerning the printing history: First edition of the first part, Venice, 1550; First edition of the second part, Venice, 1553; Dedication, dated September 1, 1553, at Venice, from edition of 1555.  My description, based on a physical examination of the title pages and four volumes of the &#34;Society of Bibliophiles&#34; edition is:  &#34;The Facetious Nights of Straparola.&#34; Now First Translated into English by W.G.

As for some of the publishing complications I have mentioned: The Society of Bibliophiles’ &#34;Italian Novelists&#34; series also included a three-volume translation by Waters of &#34;The Pecorone of Ser Giovanni&#34; (1558) by Giovanni Fiorentino (dates, and exact identity, uncertain). I am not aware any other publications by the &#34;Society of Bibliophiles,&#34; but this appears to have been the whole of &#34;The Italian Novelists&#34; it published, as some title pages of some printings indicate that it ran to seven volumes. The “Pecorone” translations are sometimes listed as volumes one through three (under its own title), and sometimes as five through seven (as part of the series), which muddles things if one searches for Waters and “The Italian Novelists” on-line.  Although it is not all that well known in English, three stories from the Straparola collection were incorporated in Painter's &#34;Palace of Pleasure,&#34; a major Elizabethan compilation, often regarded as a source for Shakespeare. However, although &#34;Facetious Nights&#34; contains a number of entertaining tales, Straparola's stories are, in general, regarded as possibly closer to Italian oral sources than his more highly literary models. Recent literature on his work seems to be concerned mainly with his role as a precursor to the literary fairy tales of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Not surprisingly, the collection may be most famous today for an early literary version of &#34;Puss in Boots,&#34; which *may* give a glimpse of its pre-literary form, although many less famous stories also appear (as Zipes will amply demonstrate for those not satisfied with Waters' lists of titles).  Warning for the Fairy-Tale-Impaired: giveaway titles ahead!  The Eleventh Night, First Fable: &#34;Soriana dies and leaves three sons, Dusolina, Tesifone, and Contantino. The last-named, by the aid of his cat, gains the lordship of a powerful kingdom.&#34; Note that the parent is the mother, not the father, and that the cat does not wear boots, which were added by Charles Perrault, in &#34;Le Maitre Chat ou le Chat Botte,&#34; (1697). See, for this instance, and for other borrowings from Italian source (or just as a brief alternative to Zipes), &#34;The Complete Fairy Tales in Verse and Prose: A Dual-Language Book&#34; by Charles Perrault, edited and translated by Stanley Appelbaum, or “Charles Perrault: The Complete Fairy Tales: A New Translation” by Christopher Betts, in the Oxford World’s Classics series.)  Straparola's version had previously been adapted, with a new (and unfamiliar) ending, by Giambattista Basile [1575-1632], in &#34;The Story of Stories,” or “Tale of Tales” (1634) also known as &#34;Il Pentamerone&#34; (edition of 1674), as &#34;Gagliuso's Story,&#34; Fourth Diversion of the Second Day: &#34;Gagliuso, having been abandoned by his father, by a cat's industry becometh rich; but showing himself insensible thereof, is reproached with his ingratitude.&#34; (From the Richard Francis Burton translation, noted above. Canepa has the much less colorful, but clearer, “Due to the industry of a cat left to him by his father, Cagliuso becomes a gentleman. But when he shows signs of being ungrateful to the cat, it reproaches him for his ingratitude.” (So,you see, dragging in Basile way back at thebeginning wasn’t pointless after all.)

The copy I have is undated, and I don't know if either is correct, or an extended publication of different volumes. The title has been rendered in various ways, including \\"Pleasant Nights,\\" and alludes to a story-telling competition held over a series of evenings to celebrate Carnival, on the obvious model of the already-classic \\"Decameron\\" of Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1350), in which well-born Italians while away the time, although in that case they were waiting for the Black Death to abate.    The English rendering by W.G. Waters (William George Waters, 1844-1928) is readable, although in my opinion a bit wooden. A slightly older version, by no less than the flamboyant Sir Richard Francis Burton, turned the author's once up-to-date Italian into archaic-sounding English for no apparent reason or literary gain. (Burton's approach seems to have worked better with a later Italian story-cycle writer, Basile, discussed below; although N.M.

He seems to have spent his adult life in Venice.    Given this uncertainty about the author, it is mildly ironic that the Amazon listings so far do not give enough information to determine just which volumes of the four are being offered by dealers, so correspondence may be necessary to assemble a complete set, without unwanted duplicates.    Those who are curious about the illustrations and stories may wish to check an html version of this edition (search for Straparola and Garnier). This now includes Waters' \\"Terminal Essay,\\" and should eventually extend to the Notes in which Waters catalogued Straparola's sources and parallels, and later uses of his stories.     There are also translations under slightly different titles, such as \\"Merry Nights\\" and \\"Most Delectable Nights,\\" which seem from the lengths given to be abridged editions, but, not having seen them, I can't tell if this is the case, and whether or not they are different translations, or the same on under variant titles.    According to the description in the translation, which appears to be drawn from the original: \\"'The Facetious Nights of Giovanni Francesco Straparola' consists of an Exquisite and Delightful Collection of Humorous, Witty and Mirthful Conversations, Fables and Enigmas Including Singing, Music and Dancing During the Thirteen Nights of the Carnival at Venice as Related by Ten Charming and Accomplished Damsels and Several Nobles, Men of Learning, Illustrious and Honorable Gentlemen of Note at the Entertainments of Merriment and Pleasure Given by the Princess Lucretia at Her Beautiful Palace at Murano.\\"    We are further informed concerning the printing history: First edition of the first part, Venice, 1550.

US	30081986	R140CVK0VR5H8H	0198812981	240026270	English Literature in the Sixteenth Century: Excluding Drama (Oxford History of English Literature Series)	Books	5	34	34	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Changes of Title, Varying Contents.	C.S. Lewis's \\"English Literature in the Sixteenth Century (Excluding Drama),\\" first published in 1954, was part of a multi-volume series, The Oxford History of English Literature, and perhaps its most distinguished contribution (but see below). It also doubled as an installment in the Clark Lectures series (for 1944), which contributes an additional subtitle in some listings.    For reasons not immediately apparent, Oxford University Press has reissued this book in a \\"New Version\\" as \\"Poetry and Prose in the Sixteenth Century.\\" As the same fate has overtaken E. K. Chambers on \\"English Literature at the Close of the Middle Ages,\\" probably the other outstanding book in the series, which is now called \\"Malory and Fifteenth-Century Drama, Lyrics, and Ballads,\\" there seems to have been a policy of titular refurbishing of at least some of the volumes in the series (once known, in an unfortunate acronym, as the O.H.E.L.).    The current titles are accurate enough, although \\"Poetry and Prose\\" should have included a warning that Elizabethan drama was covered in a different volume. (Due to the facts of human biology, Lewis' book not unexpectedly covers a slightly longer period than either title indicates.) Still, the changes can cause confusion for anyone not aware of them; given the current prices, this may be more than a little annoying to some people. If you have one version, you probably don't need the other!    Lewis on the \\"Sixteenth Century\\" was the product of enormous labor, including actually reading a huge body of writing generally ignored in literary histories, or customarily treated without much firsthand knowledge. Acquaintances -- not all of them friends, or even especially sympathetic -- described Lewis spending his days doggedly reading sermons and polemics, minor poets and bad poets, over the course of years. (He came to refer to the effort by the \\"infernal\\" acronym for the series noted above.) The result is a treasury of first-hand information, and with it Lewis' often-witty summations. It is engaging reading, even for those who disagree with Lewis -- and he seemingly set out to overturn most critical orthodoxies established between about 1900 and 1950, as well as a few older ones.    For example, he treats Elizabethan literature as an extension of medieval culture. Humanism, in its period sense of concern for a classicizing Latin style, and the disparaging of the immediate past, is treated as an often-harmful interruption. This reverses a judgment that actually goes back to the period  -- but a judgment originally made by self-styled Humanists themselves, of course. And he includes the literature of Lowland Scotland, often ignored, or treated as something apart.    \\"English Literature in the Sixteenth Century\\" also appeared as an Oxford paperback under the original title (1973), unfortunately without the bibliographic supplement in which Lewis discussed textual histories and modern editions, if any, of both the well-known and the more obscure English and Scots literature of the late fifteenth through early seventeenth centuries. This portion is, of course, half a century out of date, but Lewis' observations are still of value. Even without this section, the paperback is worthwhile, and may be a good, reasonably-priced, alternative, but anyone familiar with the original form may be disappointed.    Those interested in Lewis as a Christian apologist will find here his considered reflections on many of his predecessors, not all of them flattering, but his comments on doctrine are pretty strictly limited to explaining the issues debated. It may seem odd to see the Reformation through the lense of literary history, but Lewis avoids open advocacy, unlike his \\"Preface to 'Paradise Lost,'\\" in which (it seems to me) his concern that readers take Milton seriously tends to blend with a concern that they take seriously their own salvation.    Lewis was also a poet, novelist, and occasional short-story writer. Here he occasionallybriefly retells a story, with his usual skill, but, except for some overlapping topics, connections to his own fiction are less obvious than in some of his writings on the Middle Ages. There is a section on the Scots poet Sir David Lyndsay (d. 1555), who provided the epigraph to Lewis' novel \\"That Hideous Strength\\" (1946). And, somewhere it includes, as others have noted also, a quotation with the words \\"Stygian puddle glum.\\" They undoubtedly lurks somewhere behind both the Marshwiggle named Puddleglum and the visit to the Narnian Underlands in \\"The Silver Chair\\" (1953, written 1950), although Dante, Virgil (of course), and a host of others, are under contribution there as well.    I was under the impression, from my first reading of the book decades ago, that it was given as a quotation from Gavin Douglas' Scots translation of \\"The Aeneid\\" (1513; Lewis describes it with enthusiasm); but I have never been able to locate it in the appropriate section. A recent search of my old copy of the shorter paperback has revealed that it was indeed quoted from a translation, but as an example of bad one, and English, not Scots; of the dramas of Seneca, not Virgil. On page 256 (where I had marked it thirty years ago), \\"Tacitae Stygis\\" in \\"Hippolytus\\" (line 625), rather weakly rendered by the utterly obscure John Studley (\\"which cannot now be read without a smile\\").    Perhaps establishing just how much Lewis read, and with what close attention, no matter how dreary.    (Reposted from my \\"anonymous\\" review of September 10, 2003)	2005-09-21
US	30081986	R1SOBEPXC6JAJY	0756782090	126819671	Well of the Unicorn	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Military/Political/Philosophical Adventure Fantasy	\\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" should be recognized as one of the outstanding fantasy novels of the first half of the twentieth century, or any other time. It was first published by William Sloane Associates in 1948, as by the previously unknown author, George U. Fletcher, with a dust-jacket and frontispiece and chapter heading maps by the well-known illustrator Rafael Palacios. That edition was reprinted in hardcover (minus the dust jacket, which itself included an illustrated map) in the Garland Library of Science Fiction in 1975, with the same attribution.     It was in fact the work of Fletcher Pratt (as acknowledged, not very prominently, in the Garland edition). In the late 1940s Pratt (1897-1956; not to be confused with the group \\"The Fletcher Pratt\\"!) was a well-known military historian; several of his works in this field are, or were recently, still in print (including one of the others with Palacios maps).    He was also a science fiction and fantasy novelist, alone and in collaboration with L. Sprague de Camp, with whom he also did a series of humorous short stories.    When the Garland edition appeared, \\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" already had been published in mass-market paperback under Pratt's name in 1968, by Lancer Books. It was issued again in this format by Del Rey Books in 1976, and, with a new cover, in 1979 -- this last being version currently shown on Amazon.     It was most recently published in a British edition in 2001, as part of the Gollancz Fantasy Masterworks series of trade paperbacks, with the original pagination. This can be found on the Amazon.co.uk site, and, although it does not seem to be readily available in the U.S., is sometimes offered by Amazon directly. (Check for availability on this page!) I have not seen a copy of the edition described here, and can't be sure if \\"Diane\\" is an American outlet, the current corporate identity of  Gollancz, or a mistake.     I have described the reason (if you can call it that) for the confusing andunnecessary pseudonym, and other details of the publishing history, in a review posted with the Garland edition, which is listed on Amazon, at least for the moment, as by George U. Fletcher. If \\"Well\\" is effectively out of print in the United States, in any edition, as you read this, I suggest checking there for some helpful hints on their differences if you are trying to decide which version of it to order used.     If it has gone out of print, with any luck a U.S. publisher will also re-issue the beautifully-produced Sloane edition, as a trade paperback, under Pratt's name, (perhaps without the original publisher's unnecessary prefatory note), in the near future. It should be in print, and Palacios' maps deserve the full size (and often higher-quality paper) of such an edition.     Under any author's name, this is an extraordinary example of fantasy, pre- or post-Tolkien. It is adult in tone, very literate, and intentionally thought-provoking. There is plenty of action, and we meet a variety of appealing (and sometimes annoying) characters. Magic plays a part, but has limits, and its solutions don't always match up well with the problems. Pratt has interesting things to say about a number of topics, from sex to politics, not all of them immediately evident, but clear enough when you start looking for them, in the words and actions of minor as well as major characters. Readers of his \\"Ordeal by Fire\\" (otherwise \\"A Short History of the Civil War,\\" and various combined forms of the title) will recognize some elements. So will those familiar with his less readily available book on medieval Denmark, \\"The Third King.\\"     Pratt drew on a vast knowledge of military history and political organizations to get the details right, without going into elaborate explanations. His setting has echoes of medieval Scandinavia (his Dalarna is not the Swedish province, but someplace like it), and of the Hanseatic League, but also the Holy Roman Empire. (Neither called by these names,of course; and Pratt's Empire has rather better claims to being Holy, although not exactly Christian, than its historical counterpart.) There are also, I suspect, a few hints of the history of the Balkans. Off in the distance is a quasi-Islamic empire, the realm of \\"the heathen Dzik,\\" about whom Pratt was planning to write a story, in which, he told his friends, they would have turned out much nicer than reputed by their old enemies.     It sounds like a precursor of more recent fantasy novels with political and military themes and sub-themes. It may be, although you would have to ask their authors. Unlike many of those books, \\"Well\\" never preaches at the reader, or tries to offer doctrinaire solutions. (Pratt seems to have felt that inflexible thinking was often a source of problems in itself.) Characters express views, often tied directly to their experiences, and the reader is left to draw conclusions. But it differs markedly from Eddison and Dunsany, whose political theories ranged from pre-modern to non-existence.     \\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" is, it should be said, unrelated to Pratt's other major fantasy novel, in a setting resembling Revolutionary France \\"The Blue Star\\" (in the omnibus \\"Witches Three,\\" 1952; separate edition, 1969) -- at least, the geography and system of magic both seem incompatible. The actual sequel to \\"Well\\" was one of a number of projects Pratt was planning at the time of his sudden, untimely, death.	2005-09-15
US	30081986	R1CTAG04BKAEKU	0804815860	118651692	Chinese Symbolism & Art Motifs	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Old Work-horse Under a New Name	\\"Chinese Symbolism and Art Motifs\\" by C.A.S. Williams is listed as a \\"third edition\\" and dated 1989 (Tuttle paperback) and 2000 (Castle Books hardcover, apparently with a \\"new\\" introduction by Terence Barrow which seems to have been included in a Tuttle edition in the 1970s). This suggests that it is a fairly recent book. In fact these editions reproduce the 1941 Shanghai edition of a book published in 1931 in Peking (now officially romanized as Beijing), as \\"Outlines of Chinese Symbolism,\\" and previously revised in 1932.<br /><br />The full title of Williams' final version was \\"Outlines of Chinese Symbolism and Art Motives: an alphabetical compendium of antique legends and beliefs, as reflected in the manners and customs of the Chinese.\\" Dover Publications issued it as \\"Outlines of Chinese and Art Motives\\" (note the old-fashioned spelling) in 1976 (with correction of \\"obvious printing errors\\"); under which title I have also reviewed it. There have been other editions available as well, from a variety of publishers, some of which have slightly varying titles, such as \\"Encyclopedia of Chinese symbolism and art motives.\\" (The Tuttle paperback seems the only one listed by Amazon to get personal, identifying Williams as Charles Alfred Speed instead of sticking with initials, so C.A.S. Williams is the name to search under.)<br /><br />With 401 illustrations (including color plates on the inside covers, jacket flaps, or elsewhere, depending on the edition), it is an extremely attractive volume, packed with information, and reasonably well arranged. Williams' compendium looks like everything an ordinary curious reader could want; and I have found nothing quite comparable to it, at least in English, although there are now excellent studies of particular symbols and concepts. (Wolfram Eberhard's \\"Dictionary of Chinese Symbols\\" has a different focus, with different strengths and weaknesses.) It is still cited in reputable works by professional Sinologists, along with Williams' \\"Manual of Chinese Metaphor\\" (1920).<br /><br />It should, however, be used with caution; a useful resource to someone with the necessary background can be a snare for the rest of us. Described by Dover as the \\"work of a scholarly English resident of China,\\" it does not seem to reflect professional skills as a Sinologist, and frequently reports information at second or third hand, some of it already antiquated in 1921. Williams' own observations are interesting, but largely restricted to North China, mainly Peking and its vicinity (to Williams, very properly for the time, Peiping), and various Western enclaves on the coast. It is to Williams' credit, however, that he at least tries to include some Chinese popular culture, rather than just the idealized official versions. It is a reflection of the time that he actually rather apologizes for including Buddhist (therefore \\"foreign\\") and Taoist (to the elite as well as the missionaries, \\"superstitious\\") as well as Confucian symbols and concepts.<br /><br />Those who have read much about China will soon notice that the transliterations are inconsistent, and sometimes very odd, at times corresponding to no system that is readily apparent. This is particularly common in Williams' quotations from his sources. I suspect that a mixture of the use of spoken vernaculars and \\"classical\\" pronunciation in those sources, alongside differing transliteration systems themselves, is responsible; Williams doesn't seem to have made a clear statement of his approach to this problem (or I missed it). Apparently he used the Wade-Giles himself, but didn't try to impose it on quotations. In a world of books then already littered with German, French, Dutch, English, and other systems for alphabetical renderings of Chinese, and now with the continuing use of the old Wade-Giles system alongside the \\"official\\" Pinyin, both with variants, this is a real nuisance, although usually not more than that. (It would be nice if, in some future edition,a qualified person supplied current Romanized renderings for the Chinese characters; and possibly the modern, simplified form; but it doesn't seem likely. Everyone seems to prefer reproducing the old book as-is.)<br /><br />More serious is Williams' sometimes free-and-easy use of materials without, apparently, checking their ultimate origin, so that his impressive citations can't always be taken at face value. (In addition, his references to nineteenth-century academic journals are of little practical help today, although inevitable when the book was first published.) In one extreme case, the result is rather amusing.

More serious is Williams' sometimes free-and-easy use of materials without, apparently, checking their ultimate origin, so that his impressive citations can't always be taken at face value.

US	30081986	R3LM5MEPXGHF60	0345379918	559446174	Sun Pin: The Art of Warfare (Classics of Ancient China)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Excellent Edition, In Two Versions	This 1996 volume in the Ballantine \\"Classics of Ancient China\\" series has been allowed to go out of print in its original format, although used copies seem to be readily available. There is a modified (but apparently not revised) 2003 edition under a different title from another publisher (see below). The Ballantine series was notable for offering texts re-edited or re-assessed on the basis of documentation recovered by archeologists in China during the 1970s, instead of the \\"received\\" texts handed down over centuries of copying, editing, and Imperial censorship, including some works otherwise lost. They combined up-to-date scholarship with an attractive presentation, popular appeal, and reasonable prices for bilingual volumes on rarefied topics.    For those not familiar with this one already, \\"Sun Pin ping-fa\\" was long thought to be a bibliographic ghost, or even a lost forgery, a long-missing supposed counterpart to the existing \\"Art of War\\" (Ping-Fa) of the elder Sun (Sun-tzu; in Pinyin transliteration, Bingfa and Sunzi). It was one of the texts described in Han Dynasty bibliographies and histories, but not reliably reported as existing for well over a thousand years, although sometimes quoted in compendia. The conclusions that it probably hadn't existed, or wasn't authentic if there was such a work, and that the supposed citations were worthless, had to be abandoned when substantial fragments of it, and other texts, turned up in 1972, during the excavation of early Han Dynasty tombs.     There have been several other translations of Sun Pin into English during the last decade, but the co-authors of this volume make a distinguished combination of an eminent senior Sinologist, with a long career working with the problems of early literary texts (Lau) and a sophisticated modern interpreter of Chinese intellectual history (Ames). Ames had earlier edited and translated an edition of Sun-tzu for the \\"Classics of Ancient China\\" series, which made use of archeologically-recovered ancient copies in addition to the received (\\"traditional\\") text, and re-assessed the place of \\"militarist\\" thinkers in early Chinese philosophy.    As a result of this collaboration, the reader is assured of first-rate technical scholarship, and clearly-expressed explanations. Their emphases, not unexpectedly, are on textual and linguistic problems, and the place of the text in the development of Chinese military and political theory.    The Ballantine Books production of the volume was outstanding. The Chinese text is presented in traditional vertical format, with as much or little space given it as necessary, and the English translation is presented beginning on a facing page. This leaves a lot of blank space, but it appears fully legible, and for the shorter chapters seems to be conveniently arranged for those able to read early Classical Chinese; the longer ones require flipping back a page or two to compare the original to the translation. A nice set of photographs includes the tombs, period weapons and other equipment, and some examples of the tomb texts as recovered. These last give some indication of the obstacles facing the Chinese scholars who had been given the task of publishing them.    As mentioned above, the Lau and Ames translation is available new (for the moment) as \\"Sun Bin: The Art of Warfare: A Translation of the Classic Chinese Work of Philosophy and Strategy\\" in the SUNY Series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture (State University of New York Press, 2003). So far as I have been able to tell (and reported in my review of it) there were no textual changes in the English text beyond the replacement of Wade-Giles transliterations with Pinyin equivalents, but it was substantially altered in appearance. The English print is smaller, or at least more cramped-looking (reduced leading?). The Chinese text now runs horizontally (although the characters seem larger and more easily distinguishable), and, with white space drastically reduced, theblocks of Chinese alternate with blocks of English on the same page in a manner which may be confusing. (The difference is particularly evident in Part III, \\"Texts Recovered From Later, Commentarial, Historical, and Encyclopedic Sources,\\" which becomes very crowded and a bit confusing.) The photographs are omitted, except for one used as cover art. As a result, the 367 total pages (including plates) of the Ballantine edition are reduced to just 265.    Of the several other translations of the fragmentary, and in part enigmatic, text of Sun Bin that are now available, \\"Military Methods of The Art of War\\" by Ralph D. Sawyer, with the collaboration of Mei-chun Lee Sawyer, published in various formats, may be the most satisfactory alternative, or, better, companion volume. It is somewhat more popular in presentation than Lau and Ames, but the most important difference is the Sawyers' attempt to place the text in the military (and political) history of China (as against Ames on the the history of Chinese military thought), a topic on which they have produced a series of translations and studies, including the monumental \\"Seven Military Classics of Ancient China,\\" offering the whole \\"Military Canon\\" as established in the eleventh century.	2005-08-14
US	30081986	R1XZPM9OHDPIGD	0486440230	933494304	A Middle English Reader and Vocabulary	Books	5	132	135	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: New Label, Familiar Package	This is a welcome paperback reprinting, unfortunately under a confusing new title, of a classic anthology, Kenneth Sisam's \\"Fourteenth Century Verse and Prose\\" of 1921. This is, in fact, stated several places in the Dover edition of the book, but the information apparently was not supplied to Amazon in a way that appears on the page.<br /><br />\\"Fourteenth Century Verse and Prose\\" was designed for use as a textbook, whether in a class or for private study, with much emphasis on the language, but the overall literary quality of the selections is quite high. It is probably not too intimidating for someone who has used a good text edition of Chaucer -- by which I mean one that has not been too aggressively normalized in spelling. It might be a considerable shock to the complete novice, with its obsolete letters and unfamiliar grammar and vocabulary, and examples of dialects which are not ancestors of modern literary English.<br /><br />Kenneth Sisam (1887-1971) was, and I assume still is, a name well-known to students of Old (Anglo-Saxon) and Middle English, for important critical writings over his career, as well as a late anthology, \\"The Oxford Book of Medieval English Verse\\" (with Celia Sisam, 1971). The present book certainly contributed to students' awareness of him, if perhaps not to appreciation of his critical acumen, which here takes second place to helping the student acquire experience in reading (and understanding) Middle English.<br /><br />\\"A Middle English Reader and Vocabulary\\" is a very generic title -- I own half a dozen books to which it could apply. And Sisam's collection was a groundbreaker in its day, anything but interchangeable with others. As originally published in 1921 (Oxford, at the Clarendon Press), the 300-page \\"Fourteenth Century Verse and Prose\\" had an excellent introduction, interesting texts with informative headnotes, detailed technical endnotes, and an appendix on \\"The English Language in the Fourteenth Century.\\" However, it lacked a glossary.<br /><br />This appeared separately the following year, as \\"A Middle English Vocabulary,\\" about 170 double-column pages (no numbering), compiled by one of Sisam's colleagues, none other than the young J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien's contribution is a model of rigor, precision, and compression, and will probably be enjoyed by those intrigued by his created languages, and used with respect, if not affection, by others. This division in two volumes may have been a little annoying and expensive (two purchases instead of one), but it did have the advantage that the glossary could be kept open -- no constant flipping to the back of the book.<br /><br />Although Dover seems to imply that they are doing something new by combining them, all of the later Oxford printings which I have seen (in libraries, or in my own collection and those of others) are, like the re-titled Dover reprinting, single-volume editions with the Vocabulary bound in the same covers.<br /><br />It is my impression that the Dover edition is a little easier to read, with both slightly larger print (the marvels of technology) and brighter, cleaner-looking pages -- although the Oxford printing I have accessible at the moment is from 1950, and may just be getting a little dingy.<br /><br />The collection, useful both as a literary sampler and as a textbook in Middle English, was reprinted in 1923, and with corrections in 1937 and 1955. (I am not sure if there were changes in later printings, such as those of 1959 and 1962 -- I think not.) Over the years the dates usually assigned to some of the texts have shifted a bit, so that a strictly literal title might have at some point have been \\"Late Thirteenth Century, Fourteenth Century, and Early Fifteenth Century English Prose and Verse,\\" while at another the thirteenth century would have disappeared again.<br /><br />A few decades later, a more comprehensive work, the \\"Handbook of Middle English\\" by Fernand Moss&eacute; (as translated from the French by James A. Walker, 1951), attempted to survey the whole Middle English period, from the twelfth century onwards.  It was the textbook I used as a graduate student, and is currently in paperback. Its 130-odd pages on grammar, phonology, and dialects are much more useful than Sisam's appendix (the dedicated student will find it invaluable). But Moss&eacute; is sometimes stupefying in detail. His selection of readings is much more heavily weighted to displaying linguistic features, and sometimes denies that a passage has any other interest. (He seems to have missed the political scandals in the \\"Mercers' Petition\\"!)<br /><br />Sisam's selection of literary materials was excellent -- so much so that most later anthologies of Middle English, and collections of translations, have duplicated many of his choices; even Moss&eacute; often has different excerpts of the same texts. Sisam avoided the readily-available Chaucer, but some choices, such as Wicliff (Wycliff) on the translation of the Bible, and John of Trevisa on \\"The Languages of Britain\\" (in the \\"Translation of Higden's Polychronicon\\" were probably inevitable.

US	30081986	R3TIVJ1AEDAQ57	0791404609	118347356	The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China (Chinese Philosophy and Culture Series)	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: 10 Sun Gods, Black Birds, and Oracular Turtles	\\"The Shape of the Turtle\\" was a follow-up study, continuing Sarah Allan's 1981 book \\"The Heir and the Sage: Dynastic Legend in Early China.\\" The older book was a well-received effort to make sense of variations in succession-stories recounted in ancient Chinese texts, mainly regarding the Five Sages (primeval culture-heroes / rulers) and the Three Dynasties (Hsia, Shang and Chou -- known as Xia, Shang and Zhou in Pinyin transliteration). It argued that these reflected, not random variations drawn from storyteller's preferences, but ideological positions, as shown by the way specific sets of variants could be grouped according to the authors who cited them, and their known political and philosophical leanings.    This effort, being based on narratives, although often brief and allusive ones, was controlled by textual evidence, which in practice means the Chou Dynasty and Warring States material preserved in the Confucian Canon and a few other Daoist, Mohist, and Legalist sources, and early Han Dynasty texts. The ideas of the preceding Shang Dynasty (also known as Yin; traditionally dated 18th through 12th centuries BCE), were excluded, although the Hsia-Shang and Shang-Chou transitions are a major focus of some of the stories, since the Shang are not directly represented in the literature, but are found only as filtered by a rival dynasty and later philosophical schools. (They are supposedly represented by texts of debated age and authenticity in the \\"Shu Ching,\\" or \\"Book of Documents,\\" and by ritual poems preserved by their descendants and included in the \\"Shih Ching,\\" the \\"Book of Songs.\\")    If the Shang Dynasty was still under suspicion of being entirely mythical, as it was in the late nineteenth century, this wouldn't be a big gap. But in fact the Shang are now attested archeologically and epigraphically, ruled by kings of the right names, at about the right time, and at what seem to be the right places. They were using an early version of the Chinese script, making beautiful objects in characteristically Chinese forms, and generally acting like the founders of Chinese civilization. They ought to have place in the history of Chinese ideas. And Sarah Allan attempts to give them one.    \\"The Shape of the Turtle\\" from 1991 is an attempt to decipher the missing Shang concepts of political order and its relationship to the world. It is based on a mixture of references in the same texts, a rather large body of enigmatic art, and the brief inscriptions on \\"oracle bones\\" excavated from Shang sites in the twentieth century. \\"Oracle Bones,\\" for those unacquainted with the concept, are the shoulder-blades of cattle and the plastrons (lower shells) of turtles and tortoises, carefully shaped to ritual requirements, and, after the posing of questions, cracked by the application of heat.    The resulting patterns were \\"read\\" as signifying the answers of royal ancestors, nature spirits, and gods -- not clearly distinct categories in early Chinese thought anyway. In a minority of cases, brief inscriptions concerning the question, the questioner, the ritualist officiating, and the nature of the answer, were included on the Oracle Bones. (I would have called them Divination Bones myself, but no one was asking me....)    This was an expensive process, what with consumption of sacrificial cattle, and specially imported reptiles (so much more mystical than the local yokels!) supplied by tribute-paying vassals, and served among other things as a demonstration of royal wealth and power. The practice was ultimately replaced during the Chou Dynasty with re-usable milfoil stalks and the texts of the \\"I Ching\\" (\\"Book of Changes,\\" also known as the \\"Chou I,\\" \\"Changes of Chou\\" -- in Pinyin, Yijing and Zhouyi). But the idea of reading divine revelations in patterns discovered on a turtle shell persisted in legends of the origins of Chinese institutions, including the \\"I Ching\\" itself. (There is a interesting attempt to reconstruct and relate the practices in Edward L. Shaughnessy's 1996 volume, \\"I Ching: The Classic of Changes,\\" an edition and translation of the second-century BCE Mawangdui manuscript excavated in the 1970s.)    These inscribed examples of consultations of the supernatural have turned out to be the main source for several centuries of early Chinese history, represented in later writings by king-lists and a handful of admonitory stories about good and bad rulers, and speeches and decrees offered as ancient documents in the \\"Shu Ching\\" (Classic of History). We have kings cited by name, asking questions concerning the sacrifices to be offered to named ancestors, or about war, hunting expeditions, harvests, and how to interpret unsolicited omens -- never long, frustrating in detail, but overall allowing a lot of information to be gleaned, and the existing literary sources to be checked against contemporary, or at least much older, evidence.    As Allan emphasizes, this evidence shows that the Shang culture was literate, but so far as we know it wasn't actually literary. Their successors, the Chou, seem positively chatty by comparison, since they covered portions of bronze ritual vessels with texts mentioning the king who gave the metal, the vassal who had it cast, the occasion for it, and the purpose it was to serve, and so on.    The Shang, would, in contrast, sometimes include a few words at most on their bronzes, -- but not for lack of technical skill, as the few longer texts on very late vessels show. Their bronze casting was a marvel, and they often covered objects with complex designs, the meaning of which has teased traditional Chinese antiquarians and modern archeologists alike.    Allan's ambitious enterprise in \\"The Shape of the Turtle\\" is to \\"read\\" both the mute bronzes (and other art) and the enigmatically concise oracle texts in conjunction with Chou and later accounts of the Shang, and the bits and pieces of mythology that seems to be associated with them.    The well-established idea inlater Chinese cosmologies that the Earth is not only flat, but a Square, while Heaven is a Circle, suggests that the turtle (with domed carapace and rectangular plastron) already may have been seen by the Shang as a microcosm, an accessible (and \\"interactive\\") model of the world. More obviously, turtles seem to have been connected with the earthy and watery Yellow Springs, the underground Realm of the Dead. That association may also explain an archeologically-noted preference for Water Buffalo shoulder blades among the Oracle Bone scapulas.    Allen extends the parallel, suggesting that the plastrons were seen as cruciforms of five rectangles, a shape used in the Shang Royal Tombs, and possibly surviving in the preference for five in later later Chinese cosmology (Five Flavors, Five Elements, etc.).    Allan pays particular attention to some other odd statements about the physical world, especially the sun, which provoked annoyed comments from Confucians and others, and seem to be alien to the Chou vision of the cosmos (and so possibly an uncomfortable inheritance with lingering prestige). The result is striking, interesting, and has not met with universal acceptance.    Anne Birrell, in her impressive \\"Chinese Mythology: An Introduction,\\" has refused to accept Allan's reconstruction of a Shang myth of the Ten Suns as the ancestors of the Shang aristocracy, although admitting that the existing accounts of how Archer Yi shot them down when they appeared in the sky at the same time seems to have had some political or social implications. The concept certainly doesn't seem to belong to the Chou consensus of \\"One Sun in Heaven, One King over the People,\\" which Mencius insisted was self-evident.    Nor does Birrell agree with Allan that the \\"Black Bird\\" that was regarded as somehow ancestral to the Shang rulers had anything to do with why the Sun was later portrayed as a three-legged Raven (not most people's choice of an obviously solar bird!), and that such ideas explain why the names of days (= suns?) in the ten-day Chinese \\"week\\" are incorporated in the ritual titles of deceased Shang royalty.    Birrell is likewise not very receptive to Allan's conclusion that the accounts of the Hsia Dynasty preserved in the texts are really Shang mythical projections of their own opposites, a Lunar and terrestrial dynasty as opposed to their own Solar and celestial one, with no necessary connection to the actual past.    I am only too familiar with over-ambitious efforts to reconstruct whole mythical systems from scraps of evidence, and very aware of how a single textual discovery can overturn the most closely-argued case. But I think Allan was, at a minimum, asking the right questions, and unless there turn out to be valid technical objections (such as linguistic problems I couldn't guess at, and haven't seen cited), I regard this book as a valuable contribution, although ultimately inconclusive.    There doesn't seem to be available an up-to-date English-language source on Shang culture that is suitable for ordinary readers -- I would be delighted to learn of one. The late Kwang-Chih Chang (K.C. Chang) of Harvard University wrote extensively about the archeological and other evidence in \\"Shang Civilization\\" (Yale University Press, \\"Early Chinese Civilization\\" series, 1981), and this remains valuable, if rather dense. It offers his reconstruction of Shang kinship structures (Chang was Professor of Anthropology, so this was probably inevitable!), which Allan relies on. It should be consulted in this connection, even if other sources are found more inviting. Chang's brief \\"Art, Myth and Ritual: The Path to Political Authority in Ancient China\\" (Harvard University Press, 1983) provides one of Allan's models in her endeavor, and is easier, but it assumes a fair amount of knowledge about China in the reader. Still, it is probably required reading for getting the most out of \\"Shape of the Turtle,\\" too, even if Allan's book is more gracefully written.	2005-07-24

(There is a real island of Samothrace. Its local cult attracted attention in Hellenistic times, possibly because it offered initiates protection from drowning, certainly because it found outside patrons looking for a propaganda platform. \\"Samothrage\\" is a repeated error, probably a simple typo which has become embedded in catalogues and web pages, and complicates searches.)    The story opens with Julius Caesar planning his invasion of Britain, and deciding that some pious Greek emissaries from the Mysteries of Samothrace to the Druids of Gaul will make good hostages, and the son of their leader a perfect spy on the Britons and their Druids. He has yet to take the measure of Tros of Samothrace, who, with a scrupulous regard for his sworn word, still turns the situation into a personal war with Caesar, which ranges all the way back to Rome, and, in the sequels, across the Mediterranean to Egypt.    The seven stories on which the novel is based originally ran during  the course of a year in \\"Adventure\\" Magazine in 1925-1926, concluding with a three-part serial, and the 1934 revised version in hardcover reached 949 pages. Understandably, mass-market paperback editions have so far broken it up into several volumes.    A four-volume paperback edition of this long novel, was published by Avon Books in 1967, beginning with \\"Tros: The First Book...,\\" and followed by \\"Helma: The Second Book...,\\" \\"Liafail: The Third Book...,\\" and \\"Helene: The Fourth Book...\\" (Helma and Helene are two of the women in Tros' life. Liafail is the name of the ship he builds, which for some reason is named \\"Stone of Destiny\\" -- not the best omen, one would think, and in the wrong Celtic language besides!)     Theseeditions all had lovely covers by Douglas Rosa, which somewhat made up for the nuisance of having to get four slim-to-standard-size (150 to 250 pages) volumes instead of one rather fat one. (Three are reproduced on the 1967 page of  R.T. Gault's \\"The Absolute Elsewhere\\" site; see [...] ). The same titles were used on a similar set published in Britain a few years later by Universal-Tandem, with new cover art. The volume divisions followed the old story breaks, with two tales in each \\"Book,\\" except for the three-parter which made up the last volume.    The same titles were used on a similar set published in Britain a few years later by Universal-Tandem, with new cover art. The Avon volumes were followed by similar editions in 1969 and 1970 of the book's sequels, \\"Queen Cleopatra\\" (1929) and \\"The Purple Pirate\\" (1935). The cover art for these was not credited at the time.

US	30081986	R3LBJK71M1D7G8	1340003090	266067557	Helma (Tros of Samothrace, Part 2)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Part Two of Four (or Three, or Five, or Six)	This book, \\"Helma: The Second Book of Tros of Samothrace,\\" is part of a four-volume Avon Books paperback edition (1967) of a long historical novel. \\"Tros of Samothrace\\" published in \\"Adventure\\" Magazine in 1925-1926, and in one volume in 1934, has two shorter, but still substantial, sequels, which are sometimes listed as additional volumes of \\"Tros\\" in paperback reprintings (see below).<br /><br />The first novel originally appeared over the the course of a year as seven stories in nine parts, and the revised version in hardcover, the basis of the later editions, reached 949 pages. It is understandable, if inconvenient, that mass-market paperback editions have so far always broken it up into several volumes. (As of this writing, Amazon, like many other online sources, sometimes gives the real place-name of \\"Samothrace\\" as \\"Samothrage\\" -- a typographical error which complicates a search for copies.)<br /><br />The story of \\"Tros of Samothrace\\" opens with Julius Caesar planning his invasion of Britain, and deciding that some pious Greek emissaries from the Mysteries of Samothrace to the Druids of Gaul will make good hostages, and the son of their leader a perfect spy on the Britons and their Druids. He has yet to take the measure of Tros of Samothrace, who, with a scrupulous regard for his sworn word, still turns the situation into a personal war with Caesar, which ranges all the way back to Rome, and, in the sequels, across the Mediterranean to Egypt. Tros plays a part in or witnesses the repulse of Caesar from Britain, the downfall of the Roman Republic, and the emergence of the Principate of Caesar's nephew, soon to be acclaimed as \\"Augustus,\\" The Revered One -- but the excitement is in what isn't found in the history you should have learned in school.<br /><br />Early in his adventures among the Britons, Tros encounters some Nordic seafarers -- about half a millennium early, but never mind -- including the beautiful Helma. Tros impresses them not only as a warrior and seafarer, but as a storyteller. (So don't let on that he's giving them recaps of Homer.)<br /><br />A four-volume paperback edition was published by Avon Books in 1967 (officially August through November), beginning with \\"Tros: The First Book...,\\" and followed by the present volume, \\"Helma: The Second Book...,\\" with \\"Liafail: The Third Book...,\\" and \\"Helene: The Fourth Book...\\" containing the second half. (Liafail is the name of the ship he builds, which for some reason is named \\"Stone of Destiny\\" in Gaelic -- not the best omen, one would think, and in the wrong Celtic language besides! Helene is another of the women in Tros' life.)<br /><br />These editions all had lovely covers by Douglas Rosa, which somewhat made up for the nuisance of having to get four slim-to-standard-size (150 to 250 pages) volumes instead of one rather fat one. The same titles were used on a similar set published in Britain a few years later by Universal-Tandem, with new cover art. The volume divisions followed the old story breaks, with two tales in each \\"Book,\\" except for the three-parter which made up the last volume.<br /><br />The Avon volumes were followed by editions in 1969 and 1970 of the book's sequels, \\"Queen Cleopatra\\" (1929) and \\"The Purple Pirate\\" (1935). The cover art for these was not credited by the publisher. (I'm among those who attribute them to Jeff Jones.) They are described as \\"Tros # 5\\" and \\"Tros #6\\" on the covers and in many listings, although strictly speaking they should be Two and Three in the series. These two don't seem to have had Tandem paperback editions.<br /><br />(Note that Mundy's similar-sounding \\"Caesar Dies\\" involves the Emperor Commodus, and is NOT part of the Tros series.)<br /><br />\\"Tros\\" was repackaged in paperback by Zebra Books (Kensington Publishing), in 1976-1977, in three volumes instead of four. In that version, the story appeared as: \\"Lud of Lunden,\\" \\"Avenging Liafail,\\" and \\"The Praetor's Dungeon,\\" with \\"The Purple Pirate,\\" and \\"QueenCleopatra\\" released in that order as continuations, and listed as parts four and five (!) of the set, in 1978.

US	30081986	R2CCGPK3YTP63I	1596542594	228966957	Tros Of Samothrace	Books	5	20	21	N	Y	Ian Myles Slater on: A Book Worth Finding	\\"Tros of Samothrace\\" is a massive historical novel, which, together with two sequels, was awkwardly handled by their hardcover publishers, and treated even worse in certain paperback editions. Some care may be needed to get the complete story, in a coherent form; although the new trade paperback appears to solve the main problems for the first of the three.<br /><br />[For a 2009 edition of the series, and a Kindle edition, please see the end of the review.]<br /><br />The \\"mystifications\\" were unintentional, but perhaps ironically appropriate, given the author's dubious career in British India and Africa, and also his later occult interests. \\"Mr. Talbot Mundy\\" has been the subject of two biographies in recent decades, with more still being uncovered about his real past. A good overview is provided on-line in \\"Talbot Mundy: Master of Mystical Adventure,\\" by R. T. Gault. (Duane Spurlock has reposted Gault's bibliographic information, and in several cases I have deferred to their dates, rather than sticking with what I had found in older reference works. \\"Materials Toward a Bibliography of the Works of Talbot Mundy\\" by Bradford M. Day is available from Project Gutenberg; very good, but not easy to use in its plain-text form.)<br /><br />\\"Tros\\" and some of Mundy's other stories also have striking resemblances to later fantasy and science fiction adventure stories, not surprising given that Robert E. Howard was among Mundy's original readers, and that more recent fans included Marion Zimmer Bradley, who openly acknowledged his direct influence on one of her \\"Darkover\\" novels.<br /><br />The rather mysterious Talbot Mundy (William Lancaster Gribbon 1879-1940), whose yarns about his own (often shady) past may have been the prototype for much of his adventure fiction, seems to have written \\"Tros of Samothrace\\" almost as a detour. He had been asked by the publisher Bobbs-Merrill to write a novel about Cleopatra. It seemed to them like a sure-fire bestseller, something to out-do the sales of his popular \\"King -- of the Khyber Rifles,\\" which they had published in 1916. It would, after all, be on a more sensational topic than his Kipling-esque tales of British soldiers keeping stiff upper lips in India and Afghanistan. (Mundy, who had legally changed his name to his most popular pseudonym while becoming a U.S. citizen in 1916, seems to have either exaggerated the time he spent in India, or else returned there under other names when he was hiding from the law, unhappy wives, etc. But he wrote about it more frequently than Africa, where he had spent considerable time; of course, he had also *served* time there....)<br /><br />Mundy eventually got around to a Cleopatra novel for Bobbs-Merrill, but not before spinning out the adventures, mostly during Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain, of a supposed minor character in the planned novel. The resulting story of \\"Tros of Samothrace\\" ran for a year (Feb. 1925-Feb. 1926) in the then highly-regarded fiction magazine \\"Adventure.\\"<br /><br />It was broken into seven separately titled stories, published in nine installments, which gave the magazine a chance to back out, and probably avoided protests from readers about a serial that never seemed to end, but Mundy seems to have had the greater commercial potential of a novel in mind. They consisted of: #1 \\"Tros of Samothrace\\" (Feb. 10, 1925); #2 \\"The Enemy of Rome\\" (April 10); #3 \\"Prisoners of War\\" (June 10); #4 \\"Hostages to Luck: (Aug. 20); #5 \\"Admiral of Caesar's Fleet\\" (Oct. 10); #6 \\"The Dancing Girl of Gades\\" (Dec. 10); and, as #7, #8, and #9 the three-part \\"Messenger of Destiny\\" (Feb. 10, 20, and 28, 1926)<br /><br />To my mind, \\"Tros\\" is one of the great early twentieth century adventure novels; and the hints of occult powers and secret wisdom add flavor without getting in the way. (Mundy had just then become active in a splinter branch of the Theosophical Society; the same influences are evident in his \\"Om: The Secret of Ahbor Valley,\\" writtenthe previous year, and much of his later fiction hovers on the edge of fantasy.)<br /><br />The editor of \\"Adventure\\" (Arthur Sullivan Hoffmann) seems to have realized that almost anyone who had struggled in school with Caesar's \\"Commentaries\\" (\\"The Gallic Wars\\") was sure to smile at the idea of the story as seen from the other side -- or, rather, from a third side. (One Caesar somehow forgot to mention in his dispatches home!) And in those days, having struggled with Caesar was a pretty common experience for middle-class readers, so the subject, if not quite as glamorous as the Serpent of the Nile, was hardly obscure.<br /><br />Bobbs-Merrill didn't agree, or was put off by the ensuing controversy over Mundy's portrait of Caesar as a budding dictator cultivating his image at the expense of the \\"barbarians.\\"<br /><br />According to Mundy, Initiates from the Mysteries of Samothrace ran afoul of Caesar while on a mission to their fellow-mystics in Gaul from their Aegean island sanctuary, and were blackmailed into spying on the mysterious Land of Britain. (A good classical dictionary would confirm the existence of the island of Samothrace and its Mysteries; although hardly Mundy's Theosophical exposition of its beliefs, and wide-ranging connections to other \\"mystical orders.\\")<br /><br />But was even the wily and ruthless Caesar a match for a man like Tros, who scrupulously honored his word? Honored it precisely and literally, that is, without regard for what Caesar, or anyone else, might have intended when he exacted the promise by threatening to kill his prisoners, including Tros' father, Perseus....<br /><br />The story of Tros and his personal war with Julius Caesar was later extended in another two substantial, but shorter, novels. \\"Queen Cleopatra\\" had no magazine publication, but appeared (at last!) directly from Bobbs-Merrill in 1929 (426 pages). Instead of the Antony and Cleopatra story, it deals in part with her escape from Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar, an obscure episode in which it turns out Tros (of course) had a role. Mundy and Bobbs-Merrill later permanently parted ways (after fifteen years), with the \\"Tros\\" stories and the delayed Cleopatra novel apparently among the simmering issues.<br /><br />His new publisher, Century, soon merged with D. Appleton, further complicating the bibliographic record. \\"Tros of Samothrace\\" finally appeared in a revised form from by D. Appleton-Century, with a British edition from Hutchinson, in 1934. \\"The Purple Pirate,\\" a sequel to \\"Tros\\" and \\"Queen Cleopatra\\" then appeared as four stories in \\"Adventure\\" and immediately thereafter as a book from Appleton-Century (367 pages), also with a British edition, all in 1935<br /><br />The complete \\"Tros\\" alone ran to a whopping 949 pages (960 in the British printing), even without the sequels. It was a work of historical fiction more on the scale of \\"War and Peace\\" than anything Bobbs-Merrill had planned, or, with \\"Gone With the Wind\\" still in the future (1936), probably considered practical in the American market. \\"Tros,\\" didn't become a blockbuster bestseller, but it seems to have sold well enough for Appleton-Century to take on one of the sequels.<br /><br />And the book was fondly remembered by those who read it. Who could forget a character who combined mysticism and heroics, nobility and practicality, exactly as appropriate? So he wouldn't kill a man, but didn't feel it was his responsibility to find out if he could swim before tossing him overboard... And a more than slightly unlikely, but attractive, supporting cast of friendly Theosophical Druids, Victorian-style Ancient Britons (\\"By Lud of Lunden!\\"), and proto-Vikings? Or even the rather Hinduized Pythagoreanism that seems to underlie all the talk of Secret Wisdom?  By this time, too, Mundy's mostly hostile portrait of Caesar could be seen as a foreshadowing of Fascism.<br /><br />\\"Tros\\" was revived in complete hardcover editions by the science fiction and fantasypublisher Gnome Press in 1958 (along with \\"The Purple Pirate\\"), and, most recently by Buccaneer Books in 1995. The new trade paperback edition is welcome. There was another hardcover (I think) reprinting of \\"The Purple Pirate\\" from Amereon, in 1991.<br /><br />Unfortunately, copies of these, especially of \\"Tros,\\" have to be sorted out from among the fractionalized paperback reprints.<br /><br />For the mass-market paperback editions present a much more complicated picture.<br /><br />Perhaps vindicating Bobbs-Merrill's original proposal, \\"Queen Cleopatra\\" appeared from Ace in 1962, with a cover Gault describes as \\"obviously redrawn from a publicity still of Elizabeth Taylor.\\" Beyond the desire to cash in on the publicity, there is no special connection between the book and the motion picture (ultimately released in 1963), let alone the associated scandals; just the use of some of the same historical personages. (Lud, and perhaps fear of lawsuits, be thanked, Burton wasn't added to the cover.)<br /><br />In 1967, Avon Books put \\"Tros of Samothrace\\" into paperback in four volumes, as \\"Tros: The First Book of Tros of Samothrace\\" (= #1-2); \\"Helma: The Second Book...\\" (= #3-4); \\"Liafail: The Third Book...\\" (#5-6); and \\"Helene: The Fourth Book...\\" (#7-9). All of them had lovely covers by Douglas Rosa. (\\"Helma\\" and \\"Helene\\" are two of the women in Tros' life. \\"Liafail,\\" the Irish \\"Stone of Destiny,\\" is here the name of a ship. Not the most appropriate name, one would think, besides being from the wrong branch of the Celtic languages, but philology wasn't Mundy's strong point.)<br /><br />For me the Avon volumes came at just the right time -- I was reading Caesar in Latin, and was amused when Tros gave him a concise, accurate, and completely misleading, report on his adventures in Britain, in exactly Caesar's own compressed style. And was praised for it.<br /><br />The four volumes were followed by Avon in 1969 with \\"Queen Cleopatra\\" and in 1970 with \\"The Purple Pirate,\\" identified as \\"Tros of Samothrace #5\\" and \\"...#6,\\" respectively, on the uncredited covers (which look to me and others like the work of Jeff Jones, but seem to be attributed by some to Frank Frazetta.) Avon also issued some of Mundy's occult / espionage / adventure stories set in modern India and Tibet, including \\"Om,\\" at about the same time.<br /><br />The Avon \\"Tros\\" was followed in Britain by a Universal-Tandem four-volume paperback set in 1971, officially based on the 1934 British edition from Hutchinson, but basically a variant of the Avon editions, with the same titles, but new cover art. The two sequels apparently were not included.<br /><br />\\"Tros\\" and its sequels have not fared so well in paperback since. There was another, differently arranged, multi-volume edition from Zebra Books (Kensington Publishing), in 1976-1977, generally regarded as examples of inept book production, badly arranged and riddled with misprints, although the Tom Barber wraparound covers were rather nice. (Gault calls the edition \\"abysmal.\\") It was divided into \\"Lud of Lunden\\" (stories 1, 2, and half of 3); \\"Avenging Liafail\\" (the rest of 3, with 4 and part of 5); and \\"The Praetor's Dungeon\\" (the rest of 5, 6, and 7). \\"The Purple Pirate,\\" and \\"Queen Cleopatra\\" were added in 1978, but in reverse order! (And so numbered.) All very confusing, especially when used copies are being listed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this makes care in ordering used copies very important. A book listed as \\"Tros of Samothrace\\" may be the full edition, or it may be only the first volume of the Avon edition -- or any volume of the Avon, Tandem, or Zebra editions, if someone was a little careless. I have seen volumes of the Avon edition listed as \\"unabridged,\\" as if they contained the whole text, and not just a quarter of the whole. \\"Paperback\\" is a good clue, but \\"binding unknown\\" is a problem; length is probably a secure guide, if it is given.<br /><br />If you can find a full set of the Avon or the Tandem editions of \\"Tros,\\" I recommend them; and a mixture should be acceptable, and may be necessary if you include \\"Purple Pirate\\" and \\"Queen Cleopatra.\\" The Zebra editions, with their inferior texts, I would consider a fallback for the curious, but may be less expensive.<br /><br />An affordable copy of any of the hardcover editions would be great!<br /><br />Do take great care that you are not ordering just one volume of a set, in expectation of the whole. (\\"Unabridged\\" has been attached to descriptions of at least two volumes of the Avon paperback, which is certainly misleading, although not really untrue; just a misunderstanding, I think.)<br /><br />Oh yes -- don't be confused about Mundy's novel \\"Caesar Dies.\\" It is an unrelated story about the Emperor Commodus, not the Dictator Julius, and Tros isn't involved. (Unless I failed to notice his reincarnation, of course.)<br /><br />And will someone get around to offering the whole series in uniform hardcovers, or at least trade paperbacks?<br /><br />[There is now a complete hardcover \\"Tros\\" -- 2009, UK & USA Leonaur Books, paperback & hardback as 6 books, corresponding to the Avon divisions, which were Mundy's own:<br />Wolves of the Tiber; Dragons of the North; Serpent of the Waves; City of the Eagles; Queen Cleopatra; Purple Pirate. (I don't know where the NEW titles came from, but they are excellent.) There is also (2013) a Kindle edition as \\"The Complete Tros of Samothrace,\\" from Pulptastic. Confusingly (again) there is a separate Kindle edition of \\"Tros\\" alone, which has the same cover art....]	2005-06-28
US	30081986	RHV9914Y85PBH	1568214278	374412902	The Path of the Upright: Mesillat Yesharim	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Ascent to Holiness	Moses Hayyim Luzzatto of Padua (1707-1746/47) was a rather controversial eighteenth-century Jewish mystic. He managed to be accused of heresy for his privately circulated Kabbalistic tracts, and also accepted as a thoroughly Orthodox expounder of the holy life for his popular writings, particularly this book (\\"Mesillat Yesharim,\\" or \\"Path of the Upright Ones\\"), written in exile in Amsterdam!    Mordecai Kaplan (1881-1983) was born in Lithuania under the Czars, lived, studied, and taught in New York, helped found the Young Israel movement in the Orthodox community, critiqued the Reform Movement, became an influential teacher at the Conservative Movement's Jewish Theological Seminary, and retired to Israel, where he continued to outrage the Orthodox with his openly modern and sociological and scientific views on religion. Along the way, he founded a fourth Movement in American Judaism.    Beyond being Jewish, and learned (and having entries in the \\"Oxford Dictionary of World Religions\\"), they don't seem to have all that much in common. Kaplan's somewhat surprising decision to translate Luzzatto's book, undertaken when he was formulating a revolutionary theory of Jewish history, brought them together.    Joseph Dan tells Luzzatto's story, briefly but clearly, near the end of his \\"Jewish Mysticism and Jewish Ethics\\" (1986: Second Revised edition, 1996), a short, stimulating book.  He thinks the situation an extreme case of the more typical bifurcation of consensus legal-ethical and controversial theological positions in some types of traditional Jewish writings, although not the most extreme. Dan, in earlier chapters of the thin volume, traced the precedents of mystics choosing to write for the public by addressing human behavior, and not specific legal and ritual issues, and being accepted within the broad discourse of normative Judaism, so his view is pretty convincing.     It should be pointed out that \\"Kabbalah\\" just means \\"[what is] received,\\" and there has been along struggle over whether the *mystical* Kabbalah, or any version of it, was really a Secret Tradition, a new private revelation (also something \\"received\\"), or just a human innovation. For those who accepted it, Kabbalah was usually considered something reserved for a qualified spiritual elite.     There is also a short, and more sophisticated, discussion of Luzzatto's intellectual background, and historical importance as a popularizer, by Dan's mentor, Gershom Scholem, in \\"On The Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts in the Kabbalah.\\" Despite the \\"Basic\\" in the title, the collected studies in the volume are full of technical discussions of the histories of ideas, and clearly meant for relatively advanced students! (\\"Basic\\" clearly means \\"Fundamental,\\" not \\"Elementary,\\" here -- translation of the titles of the German and Hebrew editions into English left an ambiguity.)     Luzzatto's short book \\"The Path of the Upright: Mesillat Yesharim,\\" leading the reader step by step through degrees of Holiness, beginning with basic Jewish religious practices, culminates in what is recognizably, but not too explicitly, a form of mystical experience. The title evokes the Biblical Patriarchs, \\"Yashar\\" (in English Bibles, usually Jashar) being a word regarded as their special epithet in glosses on Biblical references to a mysterious \\"Book of Yashar\\" (Sefer Ha-Yashar, Joshua 10:13 and 2 Samuel 1:18). But it is also intriguingly non-specific. Perhaps partly because the title implicitly attributed such deep significance to the communal norms (you too can emulate Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob!), the book soon attracted favorable attention. It actually became preferred, even required, reading, in the Rabbinic schools of nineteenth-century Lithuania, which were very much in favor of the life of conscious, thought-out, obedience to Heaven, and, although not opposed to mysticism, were very much set against its public discussion.     And not just opposed to publicity for the usual \\"Secret Teachings of the Wise\\" reasons. Like Luzzatto's original opponents, they were living in the wake of the openly mystical Sabbatean (\\"False Messiah\\") movement of the seventeenth century, and its offspring of antinomian heresies, and had the popularized mystical Hasidic movement subverting their authority as well.    \\"Path of the Upright\\" was also promoted as popular reading matter by the Mussar (\\"Discipline\\") movement of moral/spiritual reformers in Eastern Europe, which gave it a broader popularity in Jewish communities as an \\"improving\\" work for a wide public -- or at least for men literate in Hebrew, an ability far more widespread than Talmudic erudition.    So it is only an addition to the paradoxes that the present English translation (generally considered the best; there are several competing versions) was the work of the likewise controversial, but very non-mystical, Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan. Originally published by the Jewish Publication Society of America in 1936 (and reprinted by them in 1966) as \\"A Critical Edition provided with a translation and notes,\\" it offered the then (and apparently still) standard Hebrew text facing the translation. It was reprinted again in 1995 by Jason Aronson, Inc., and that edition may be the most readily available. I have seen it listed with the Hebrew and English in different orders in the title, and sometimes as by Kaplan alone.    (The dust jacket of the Aronson edition gives Luzzatto's first name as Moshe, a better transliteration, but not the one used inside. Some other translations are in fact listed as by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, and there are other transliterations. At least one version announces its allegiance to the Eastern European view of the book by giving the title in Ashkenazic pronunciation, as \\"Mesillas.\\" The Italian-born author probably would have found that a little odd.)     Kaplan was a committed rationalist, an admirer of American Pragmatists (among others) as well as a Talmudic scholar. He is best known as the founder of the modernizing Reconstructionist movement (to re-order Jewish life and thought in America; not to be confused with Christian Reconstructionists, who appear to favor re-ordering American life on theocratic lines). Unlike many of the author's original opponents, he was entirely out of sympathy with Luzzatto's other work in principle, not just worried about suspicious trends and tendencies! Kaplan was not even a speculative theologian: his 1937 book on \\"The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion\\" was largely about the spiritual and moral values of the Jewish religious calendar, and how its symbolic system and liturgy can be understood in the scientific modern world. (It appeared the year after his translation of Luzzatto.)    Still, \\"Mesillat Yesharim\\" came to him with the seal of approval of both the Wilno (or Vilna, or Vilnius) Talmudic seminaries and the highly respected Mussar teachers, and he decided to offer it to Jews in the English-speaking world as an important part of their heritage. And Luzzatto's approach to finding new and deeper meanings in tradition-prescribed actions was recognizably compatible with his own program of re-interpreting, instead of abandoning, such practices. (His critique of early twentieth-century Reform Judaism on this issue contributed to a major re-evaluation of the place of observance and ritual within that movement.)    Kaplan's introduction slights Luzzatto's Kabbalistic interests, which, given that he was working before Scholem had laid out a recognizable history of the subject, might have been fortunate. (The less said, the fewer chances to be wrong.) But Kaplan does carefully identify in running notes the exoteric (Biblical and Rabbinic) sources, which would have been instantly recognizable to Luzzatto's expected readers. Luzzatto seems to have avoided obvious references to esoteric teachings or to Halachic (legal) codes, or theological controversies, and Kaplan did not dig out any subtle ones. (Unfortunately, there is no index of the citations; I worked out a partial one for my own purposes, and found that they were heavily weighted to well-known texts.) Although Kaplan taught Homiletics, the art of giving sermons, he scrupulously refrained from imposing his exposition on Luzzatto.    A bit dry as a translation of a much-loved work; but careful, precise, and, despite the avoidance of mystical language as such, it doesn't hide what Luzzatto is talking about in the later stages. The pursuit of Holiness begins in the experience of the material and bodily, and forms a series of steps, which Luzzatto sets forth, through increasing degrees of awareness.    Some Christianity-based terms like \\"the Spiritual Life\\" don't really translate well into traditional Jewish thought, at least on the conceptual level, because they reflect distinctions (oppositions of sacred and secular, and, sometimes, of body and soul, for example) that don't quite fit. Luzzatto's short book seems to show that the type of experience doesn't need a fixed name.     If you came to this book looking for information on Kaplan and his views, there is a large literature which will be far, far more helpful. A short, and obviously favorable, introduction is Rebecca T. Alpert and Jacob J. Staub, \\"Exploring Judaism: A Reconstructionist Approach.\\" Jack J. Cohn's book in Hebrew comparing Kaplan and a revered Orthodox leader, Rav Kook, has been translated as \\"Guides for an Age of Confusion: Studies in the Thinking of Avraham Y. Kook and Mordecai M. Kaplan.\\" The former requires little knowledge of Judaism, the latter assumes a serious interest and a fair amount of background. Kaplan's own magnum opus was \\"Judaism as a Civilization: Toward a Reconstruction of American Jewish Life,\\" originally published in 1934; most of his later works popularized, expanded, or applied his views there.	2005-06-17

Like most of the other books by Edward H. Schafer (1913-1991), it deals with a wide range of Chinese literature, including works by some of the major poets. Like most of his other writings, it displays a fine English prose style, and considerable wit. It is a deeply learned book about literature which can be appreciated as literature itself. (Barring some catalogues of miscellaneous astronomical observations, worth reading, but probably not gripping for most readers.)<br /><br />\\"Pacing the Void\\" will also be of great value to those interested in the history of science, although of course not a replacement for the relevant volumes of Joseph Needham's \\"Science and Civilization in China\\" (from 1954 on), or even a direct rival to Ho Peng Yoke's short \\"Li, Qi and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China\\" (1985; Dover, slightly emended, 2000). However, those interested in practicing Chinese astrology will probably be disappointed by Schafer's lack of detail on this subject, although he does take care to distinguish China's own traditions from those imported from India and acquired from the Arabs, and other Muslims, both of which are closer to European versions of the Art. (Indeed, Latin Christendom re-learned Aristotelian physics and Ptolemaic astronomy and astrology from Arabic sources.)<br /><br />Schafer's book, originally published in 1977, is, strictly speaking, a survey of the roles of astronomy, astrology, and lunar, solar, planetary, and stellar imagery in Chinese literature of the Tang Dynasty (roughly 600 to 900 C.E. -- T'ang is the old Wade-Giles system spelling of the name). Since the Chinese, unlike the followers of Plato and Aristotle, assigned transient events in the sky to \\"Heaven,\\" not the air, it also includes meteors, comets, the Aurora Borealis, and \\"Visitors\\" (novas and supernovas), which in medieval Western thought were all \\"meteorological\\" phenomena. (Ever wonder where that name for atmospheric events came from?)  He also deals with the theme of \\"correspondences\\" between terrestrial and celestial events, personages, objects, and substances.<br /><br />\\"Pacing the Void,\\" like \\"The Vermilion Bird: T'ang Images of the South\\" (1967), \\"The Shore of Pearls: Hainan Island in Early Times\\" (1969), and \\"The Divine Woman: Dragon Ladies and Rain Maidens in T'ang Literature\\" (1973), was part of series of studies by Schafer on Tang culture from various unusual perspectives. The most famous of them is probably \\"The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics\\" (1963), which is the only one that the original publisher, the University of California Press, has kept in print. If experience is any guide, anyone interested in the subjects covered in \\"Pacing the Void\\" would be well-advised to find a copy now, while it is still available. (As of this writing, Amazon is offering an attractive discount, too.)<br /><br />The present edition of \\"Pacing the Void\\" was originally announced for release in spring 2004, and, after some apparent changes in co-publishing arrangements, finally became available in 2005, from Floating World Editions and Antique Collectors' Club. One hopes that the announced plan of reprinting all of Schafer's out-of-print scholarship (perhaps including some of the previously uncollected articles, as well as a bibliography) will be accomplished.<br /><br />The present paperback edition -- a very handsome volume -- is described as offering a corrected text, based on Schafer's corrigenda for any future printing. I can't confirm this directly, since I read it once, rather quickly, about twenty-five years ago, and didn't recognize changes while re-reading it. (Or expect to.)<br /><br />I had even forgotten Schafer's charmingly off-hand reference to John Carter's adventures on Mars (page 235; the uninitiated should see Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"A Princess of Mars\\" and its sequels), and the comparison of a Chinese poem about a painting of the moon, a cypress tree and a hare to the art of Arthur Rackham (page 187). (If you know Rackham's illustrations to fairy tales, or Wagner's \\"Ring,\\" you will probably be able to visualize the elements of such a Rackham picture in detail, even though in fact it doesn't happen ever to have been painted by Rackham....)<br /><br />Quite coincidentally, Schafer sometimes offers alliterating translations or interpretations of Chinese titles that would be at home on Harry Potter's reading list -- such as \\"Saunters to Sylphdom\\" for a sequence by Ts'ao T'ang (page 205), which now sounds like something by Gilderoy Lockhart.<br /><br />Schafer assumes a basic knowledge of naked-eye astronomy and the modern heliocentric solar system, and at least a nodding acquaintance with the basics of Chinese culture. If you don't know Orion, or the number of signs in the Western Zodiac, or recognize retrograde motion when he mentions it, you probably need a refresher course before starting \\"Pacing the Void.\\" There are plenty of good books on the subject. (Such information will also help judge the relevance of the many instances in which Schafer helpfully supplies information from telescopic astronomy on star colors, multiple stars, and invisible companions, always interesting, but I suspect, confusing for the unwary.)<br /><br />And you should certainly be able to tell Yin from Yang, and know the stereotypical differences between Taoists and Confucianists (the real ones would be nice, too), and be aware that Buddhism is not native to China. (You might be surprised at how many people seem to associate Buddhas only with Chinese restaurants....) Central Asian physical geography, in the form of the dust storms blowing over Northern China, turns out to be part of observational astronomy -- this added variable color to observations, a lore unmatched in the West. However, the book is not directed to the advanced scholar of esoteric lore; on my first reading, I knew comparatively little of Chinese culture and history, and I was intrigued and entertained, even if I had to struggle through some sections, and now feel that I probably missed a lot. The book clearly makes some demands on the reader, due mainly to its subject-matter, and is probably less accessible to the novice than Schafer's books about plants, animals, objects, and landscapes -- as I began by saying, it requires a serious interest.<br /><br />I have provided references to a few books on some aspects of both medieval European astrology and the general history of astronomy in a review of Laura Ackerman Smoller's 1994 study of a Cardinal's encounter with  \\"History, Prophecy, and the Stars: The Christian Astrology of Pierre D'Ailly, 1350-1420.\\" These may be helpful for those interested in comparing traditions. C.S. Lewis's \\"The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature\\" (1967) is more basic, but it integrates medieval Christian astronomy into a total world-view, and relates it to literature, in a miniature version of Schafer's approach. And it probably will be found easier reading, too.<br /><br />For those with a real curiosity about pre-Tang Chinese thought on the subject, particularly as preserved in the \\"Confucian Classics\\" and their interpreters going back to the Han Dynasty -- the great models and sources for the Tang scholars themselves, of course -- there are a number of books available. For the \\"natural science\\" side, Ho Peng Yoke's previously mentioned \\"Li, Qi and Shu\\" is convenient, although its coverage extends all the way to the Ming Dynasty and beyond. For some of the various supernatural beings related to the stars, moon, and planets in Chinese lore, and the especially the pursuit of longevity or eternal life, to which Schafer makes frequent reference, I would suggest Michael Loewe's learned and well-written \\"Ways to Paradise: The Chinese Quest for Immortality\\" (1979), if a copy is available, although archeology has made it a little out of date.<br /><br />Anne Birrell's \\"Chinese Mythology: An Introduction\\" (1993) contains translations of many important texts, some of which Schafer briefly summarizes as they were understood by Tang writers, others providing the background for archaic assumptions about the universe which were inherited by the later Chinese.<br /><br />And mention of Birrell's collection of diverse materials offers a convenient transition to John S. Major's \\"Heaven and Earth in Early Han Thought: Chapters Three, Four, and Five of the *Huainanzi*\\" (1993), which provides a translation with commentary of three \\"cosmic\\" treatises from an encyclopedic synthesis of Chinese knowledge (c. 120 BCE) --  Major argues that it offers an intentionally rationalized version of that traditional mythology. It certainly includes many of the descriptions of planetary and stellar deities taken for granted by the Tang literati.<br /><br />Major explicitly uses Schafer's translations of Chinese terms where they are available (most of the time), which for once makes comparisons between two such discussions relatively simple. Only relatively; Major uses Pinyin transliterations by preference, while Schafer was still using Wade-Giles -- so he refers to the \\"Huainanzi\\" as the \\"Huai nan tzu.\\" A worthwhile book for the truly serious, but not designed to be entertaining, which Schafer usually manages to achieve.	2005-06-01

Gordon's collection of translations from ancient sources concerning the Huns in Europe, interspersed with modern narrative and interpretation, remains an almost indispensable introduction to its subject. The limits of \\"The Age of Attila\\" (1960) become clearer with repeated use, but it was never intended as a profound contribution to historical literature. It covers one of the more dramatic aspects of the \\"Barbarian Invasions\\" that marked the final stages of the Roman Empire in the West, and the final shift of imperial power to Constantinople (Byzantium) in the East, offering a good selection of the surviving narratives of the events.    Although \\"The Age of Attila: Fifth-Century Byzantium and the Barbarians\\" does not contain all of the relevant ancient sources (mostly fragments surviving in later works), it has most of them, gathered in one place, and set in context with each other and with relatively recent ideas about the period. For one major source, Priscus' narrative of an embassy to the Huns, it gave the first complete English translation of all of the surviving fragments. Such direct translations are offered in italics, often mixed with Gordon's own observations in roman type, or, in the case of brief fragments, dropped into his narrative as illustrations and examples. This provides a unified reading experience, instead of a mere collection of disjointed extracts. (Appendix A gives the dates and sources of fragments, and the pages where the translations appear, and Appendix B describes the Historians themselves.) Technical problems with texts are confined to the Notes, and the glossary of \\"Geographical Names\\" deals with the special problems they present.     The coverage is selective, since the focus is kept on the Huns, not the Roman Empire, or the other \\"Barbarian\\" tribes, during Attila's lifetime; however, as pointed out in the Foreword by Arthur E.R. Boak, it does cover the major political events of the period, as the Hunswere involved with most of them, one way or another.     I was delighted to find a copy of the 1966 Ann Arbor paperback reprint shortly after discovering the book, and there have been later reprintings in hard cover, some fairly recent. Although there is a huge literature on the subject, surprisingly few books in English deal with the Huns as their primary focus. A more up-to-date work of similar scope is certainly desirable; but Gordon's work can't be faulted for it. And in that light the lack of a detailed, but ever-more-obsolete, bibliography is less important. The narrative is sometimes confusing, because the sources are less than reliable, and the events chaotic, but Gordon manages to keep the main lines clear, while indicating some of the problems.     Beyond the matter of the collapse of Rome, and the rise of the Barbarian kingdoms, is the long after-life of these events in song and story. Those interested in the Nibelungs and the Volsungs, and the Dietrich von Bern cycle, prominent in medieval German and Scandinavian literatures, will find here many of the original events and personages, among the Burgundians, Goths, and Huns, and some less familiar peoples. (Dietrich is based mainly on the later Theodoric the Great \\"of Verona\\", but in medieval legend his story has been confused with that of his father Theudomir, an actual contemporary of Attila, among other anachronisms.)     I read Gordon's treatment with pleasure, and considerable profit, in about 1970. At that date, as when it appeared, E.A. Thompson's \\"A History of Attila and the Huns\\" (1948) was the main alternative, and it often gave quotations in the original Greek and Latin, so Gordon was at minimum an essential aide for most readers. (In its 1996 revised incarnation as \\"The Huns\\" in the \\"Peoples of Europe\\" Series, with an interesting Afterword by Peter Heather, such passages are translated, following Thompson's [d. 1994] instructions.) Thompson tended to favor materialist views of history, which sometimes fits a little oddly with how little we actually know of the economy of the Huns. Indeed, he presented them as almost entirely predatory, lacking such skills as metal-working, and even weaving, although it is hard to imagine Eurasian nomads without cloth. Gordon doesn't address such issues, beyond the goods the Huns demanded as tribute.    The serious student of the nomadic peoples will want to go on to the material, literary, and linguistic evidence painstakingly assessed in \\"The World of the Huns: Studies in their History and Culture\\" (1973) by Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen (1894-1969). This somewhat ponderous work had to be edited from the author's unfinished manuscript, despite his assurances to the publisher, shortly before his death, that it was all but completed. It is filled with otherwise difficult-to-find information, has a copious bibliography, and 75 illustrations. Many common identifications of the Huns with other peoples are mentioned only to be dismissed; in the 1940s Maenchen-Helfen had already disproved the accepted equation with the Hsiung-nu, enemies of Han Dynasty China when the Roman Empire was young. (Their name was probably pronounced something like \\"Hong\\"  at the time, so the equation looks plausible, but has other difficulties.) Although out of print, \\"World of the Huns\\" was a book club selection, and used copies seem to be readily available.     It is a marked contrast to Gordon's more novice-friendly approach, but Maenchen-Helfen briefly mentions Gordon's book with respect, if not always agreement, unlike any number of more ambitious works which he is at pains to refute. Frankly, given the limitations on languages I can read, I can't imagine understanding Maenchen-Helfen's references to the sources *without* Gordon.     Those who find Thompson's interpretation of the decline of Rome and the nature of Barbarian economies too Marxist may enjoy Maenchen-Helfen's sniping at his, and Soviet (mainly Stalinist-era), readings of their history. In Eastern Bloc histories, as in older Slavophile views, the Huns were generally rather identified with the image of the Mongols, monsters to be hated for oppressing the Slavs -- except in Hungary, of course, where there was a tradition (not linguistically sound) of ethnic identification, or the rare instances when the Huns were allowed to be freedom-loving opponents of the wicked Imperialists ... . A more general difficulty in assimilating pastoral nomads to Soviet versions of Marxist ideology was also involved. But the Huns have had a variety of modern political \\"meanings\\" (see Maenchen-Helfen's \\"Fragments from the Author's Preface\\").     A comparison of Gordon, or any of these modern versions, with the comparable chapters of Gibbon's eighteenth-century vision of \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\" may be left as an exercise for the curious. And if you are still confused by the USA Network's 2001 cable television movie \\"Attila,\\" it is likely that any of these books will help replace its fictional problems with genuine historical ones.    [Addendum: Those seriously interested in the history of the Roman Empire during this period, beyond the Huns and other \\"barbarian\\" peoples, or those who need to consult the actual texts, will find all the extant fragments of Gordon's major sources in R. C. Blockley, \\"Fragmentary Classicising Historians of the Later Roman Empire: Eunapius, Olympiodorus, Priscus and Malchus\\" (volumes one and two; Francis Cairns, Liverpool 1981 and 1983). This includes notes and a new translation. Unfortunately, the material assigned to an important compiler, John of Antioch, also used by Gordon, is not available in complete form in English, and excerpts like his are based on an edition about 150 years old. However, a new critical edition, with an Italian translation, has recently appeared, edited by Umberto Roberto, \\"Ioannis Antiocheni Fragmenta Ex Historia Chronica\\"  (Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, 2005). Between them, they cover almost all of the classical texts translated in \\"The Age of Attila.\\" (Both books are listed by Amazon.)]    [With thanks to Alan Cameron's review in the on-line 'Bryn Mawr Classical Review,\\" July 2006 [BMCR 2006.07.37], for information on Roberto's edition, and reminding me of Blockley's volumes, which I haven't seen in at least ten years, and couldn't identify by memory.]	2005-04-22

The sagas (prose narratives) from medieval Iceland are more diverse in subject than would be indicated by the more readily available translations. Of course, the major \\"Islendingasogur\\" (\\"Sagas of the Icelanders\\") are, alongside the series of Kings' Sagas (mainly in Snorri Sturluson's \\"Heimskringla\\"), and the lives of the Earls of Orkney, among the great glories of medieval literature, and deserve the attention they have received. The stories of Icelandic families, conflicts and legal disputes, poets, outlaws, and lawyers, are unlike anything in Europe before the modern novel, and the accounts in the Kings' and Earls' sagas of both dynasty-builders and feckless rulers also deserve the praise they get.<br /><br />But there are also \\"Fornaldarsogur,\\" the \\"tales of olden times,\\" retelling ancient Germanic and Scandinavian legends (notably \\"Volsunga Saga,\\" \\"Heidrek's\\" or \\"Hervarar Saga,\\" and \\"Hrolf Kraki's Saga\\"). Only a few of them are as well-known as they deserve, and then often because of associations with other works (the Sigurd / Siegfried legend, \\"Beowulf\\"). And there are accounts of bishops and saints, translations and imitations of Arthurian romances and Carolingian chansons de geste (\\"riddarasogur,\\" \\"knightly tales,\\"), and fantastic stories (\\"lying sagas\\") of adventure and romance among supernatural beings or in distant lands. \\"Sturlunga Saga\\" is a compilation of partisan reports of contemporary events, somewhat cloaked in the objectivity of the saga style. These are largely under-represented in English translation, or at best such translations usually are available only in large or specialized libraries.<br /><br />The great period of saga-writing was the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but stories in the native style continued to be written in later times. There has been tendency to date \\"good\\" sagas early, and \\"inferior\\" sagas late, and reject the \\"late\\" works. But most of the genres (if not specific surviving examples) seem to have been around from the beginning, at least as oral tales. There are close parallels to some of  the more extravagant attested before 1220, in the \\"Gesta Danorum\\" of Saxo Grammaticus. The present volume was an interesting attempt to make examples of some of the more neglected kinds of saga more familiar to ordinary readers, without worrying overmuch about their relative age or degree of literary sophistication.<br /><br />The contents will be less surprising to those not directly familiar with great sagas, however. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the distinctions were not at all clear, and the thin antiquarian veneer of (the now obviously fictional) \\"Frithjof's Saga\\" was treated with immense seriousness, and even accorded great political importance. Boosted by a retelling by the poet Tegner, it achieved European celebrity when a masterpiece like \\"Njal's Saga\\" was just a name (at best). Quotations from its late medieval and hyperbolic version of Viking life are still found in circulation in popular accounts, treated as serious evidence. (For this, and much else, Andrew Wawn's \\"The Vikings and the Victorians: Inventing the Old North in 19th-Century Britain\\" is illuminating.)<br /><br />The confusion is understandable. After all, among the realistic tales, \\"Eyrbyggja Saga\\" includes a dramatic haunting -- although the exorcism takes the form of a properly executed legal eviction notice! Visions of the dead, prophetic apparitions, witches, marauding reanimated corpses, trolls, and (in foreign parts) more vaguely conceived monsters may play small roles -- or large ones in \\"Grettir's Saga,\\" and some other accounts of famous outlaws. But these were, for the most part, matters of contemporary belief, and in any case the \\"Sagas of the Icelanders\\" were set mainly between about 850 and 1050, when, it was held, Christianity had yet to drive out the pagan powers, and odd things might be likely to have happened on familiar ground. (Not that the supernatural ceased to be a menacing presence in Icelandic life -- accounts through the nineteenth-century make that clear enough.)<br /><br />The \\"Seven Viking Romances\\" in this volume fall somewhere between the mainly realistic \\"Sagas of the Icelanders\\" and the most extravagant of the \\"lying sagas.\\" Some at first seem to come close to being \\"Sagas of the Icelanders,\\" and some may properly be considered \\"legendary sagas,\\" albeit with more than a little extra-traditional elaboration. And they are particularly interesting because they don't quite fit expectations. They are examples both of literary invention and of the preservation of archaic beliefs. Sorting these out has been a problem for scholars, but not the sort of problem that should prevent a reader from enjoying the stories.<br /><br />How does this work? Some of these seven involve notable Icelandic families, or rather their ancestors in the \\"Old Country\\" (Norway), and they all rely to some extent on the standard stylistic devices of the saga literature. Characters are often formally introduced to the reader with genealogical particulars, and geographic settings. Everyday activities and plain household furnishings are mentioned instead of being avoided (as in the dignified forms of contemporary European literature).<br /><br />But the pretense of being a history of a family, its eventual settlement in a new land, marriages, inheritances, and lawsuits, or an account of famous feuds in a district, and how they were resolved, falls away in favor of a rollicking good time. There is not a lot of worrying if there is enough hay to last the winter, and who has the legal rights to the stranded whale. Instead we have slaying of monsters, rescuing of princesses, or slaughtering of hordes of enemies (or at least an evil giant or two). It is rather as if what started like an historical novel rather quickly turned into one of Robert E. Howard's stories of \\"Conan the Cimmerian.\\"<br /><br />\\"Seven Viking Romances\\" starts with the relatively long \\"Arrow-Odd\\" (\\"Orvar-Odds Saga\\" -- the Orvar nickname and name Oddr taken together mean \\"Arrow-Point\\" and the pun could have been made clearer, or just left for a note). The hero seems at first to be intended as a typical saga-age early Icelander, with not-too-untypical named heroic ancestors (like the \\"I was delayed by that big fish\\" dragon-slayer, Ketil Trout) known from other stories. But we soon learn that he is destined to live many human lifetimes, and the pagan gods show up to take a (small) part in his adventures abroad, all far from Iceland. The actual trade through Arctic waters with Permia figures in the tale, in a suitably fantasticated form; there does seem to be a lot of authentically old, if not very accurate, background. The extant saga reworks older tales of heroes. There is a substantial overlap with the Heidreks/Hervarar Saga tradition in chapter fourteen, featuring the burial of the hero Angantyr with the (cursed) sword Tyrfing -- and of his eleven brothers, one of whom, confusingly, is also named Tyrfing. The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus mentions Arvarodd in connection with the fatal battle. In addition, the story of Odd's predicted death shows up in the Russian \\"Primary Chronicle,\\" although there it is told of Oleg the Seer, one of the Scandinavian-descended Princes of Kiev.<br /><br />This translation of \\"Orvar-Odd\\" was originally published separately, as \\"Arrow-Odd: A Medieval Novel\\" (1970), where I originally sought it out after studying some of the related works (such as Saxo). It appears here in slightly revised form, along with the appendix on \\"Sources and Parallels\\" (perhaps a little too condensed to be entirely clear to the uninitiated).  Most of the rest had already been published as \\"Gautrek's Saga and other medieval tales\\" (1968), and are also offered with revisions.<br /><br />The following story of \\"King Gautrek\\" (\\"Gautreks Saga\\") is one of a short series of sagas (see \\"Bosi and Herraud,\\" below), and is set in western Gautland (West Gotaland in modern Sweden) -- slightly foreign to Icelandic experience, and apparently a good setting for odd events. (As Geatland, it was Beowulf's home, and his Icelandic counterpart Bodhvar Bjarki was the brother of another King of Gautland; Odd visits it during his travels.) Frithjof's descendants show up in the story, and so does the more certainly venerable figure of Starkad, well-known from Saxo Grammaticus (and some other sources) -- like Arrow-Odd, he was one of those heroic-age figures blessed or cursed to outlive his times. Like \\"Arrow-Odd,\\" \\"King Gautrek\\" clearly belongs among the legendary sagas (\\"Fornaldarsogur\\"), but some of it seems invented, or at least \\"improved.\\"<br /><br />\\"Halfdan Eysteinsson\\" takes us to the Odin-descended kings of Trondheim, and another complex of apparently traditional tales of adventures in legendary versions of real places (Permia) and less likely ones (the Land of the Undying, discovered off-stage by one of Halfdan's relatives). It was newly translated for this collection.<br /><br />\\"Bosi and Herraud\\" begins among King Gautrek's relatives in East Gotaland, and includes a visit to the quasi-mythical King Godmund of Glasir Plains (Gudhmundr of Glaesisvellir), a sort of friendly giant, who recurs in other tales, some included here.<br /><br />\\"Egil and Asmund (\\"Egils saga einhenda og Asmundar saga berserkjabana,\\" \\"The Story of Egil One-Hand and Asmund Berserkers-Slayer\\") is set in the possibly even more exotic land of Russia. Knowledge of a long-lasting Eastern Scandinavian (Swedish) presence there, and adventures of Norwegians and Icelanders at the court of Kiev, and on the way to Byzantium, presumably inspired the setting. (Compare the extra-textual Russian connections of \\"Arrow-Odd.\\") There are excursions into Tartary, and the Aegean, but also to Halogaland (Norway), and Jotunheim, the realm of the Giants; a not untypical mixture of the known, the exotic, and the mythical.<br /><br />The volume is rounded off with two short tales, \\"Thorstein Mansion-Might\\" (\\"Thorsteins thattr baejarmagns\\"), which opens with a visit to the Underworld and an encounter with a dwarf, and continues with exploits among giants, and the very brief \\"Helgi Thorisson\\" (\\"Helga thattr Thorissonar\\"), set in the reign of King Olaf Trygvasson (995-1000). Both of these return us to King Godmund and his legendary realm of marvels and adventures, which are also attested in Saxo Grammaticus and the \\"Hervarar Saga.\\"<br /><br />Not great works -- although \\"Arrow-Odd\\" has some claims to be an especially well-told story, and the shortest works have their own compressed charm. But definitely worth having available alongside the \\"crowned masterpiece\\" examples of medieval Icelandic literature. Hermann Palsson and Paul Edwards were not wasting their time, and readers interested in giants, dwarves, and trolls, magic weapons, and the like, probably won't feel that they are wasting their time, either.ds Saga\\" -- the Orvar nickname and name Oddr taken together mean \\"Arrow-Point\\" and the pun could have been made clearer, or just left for a note).

Frithjof's descendants show up in the story, and so does the more certainly venerable figure of Starkad, well-known from Saxo Grammaticus (and some other sources) -- like Arrow-Odd, he was one of those heroic-age figures blessed or cursed to outlive his times. Like \\"Arrow-Odd,\\" \\"King Gautrek\\" clearly belongs among the legendary sagas (\\"Fornaldarsogur\\"), but some of it seems invented, or at least \\"improved.\\"<br /><br />\\"Halfdan Eysteinsson\\" takes us to the Odin-descended kings of Trondheim, and another complex of apparently traditional tales of adventures in legendary versions of real places (Permia) and less likely ones (the Land of the Undying, discovered off-stage by one of Halfdan's relatives). It was newly translated for this collection.<br /><br />\\"Bosi and Herraud\\" begins among King Gautrek's relatives in East Gotaland, and includes a visit to the quasi-mythical King Godmund of Glasir Plains (Gudhmundr of Glaesisvellir), a sort of friendly giant, who recurs in other tales, some included here.<br /><br />\\"Egil and Asmund (\\"Egils saga einhenda og Asmundar saga berserkjabana,\\" \\"The Story of Egil One-Hand and Asmund Berserkers-Slayer\\") is set in the possibly even more exotic land of Russia. Knowledge of a long-lasting Eastern Scandinavian (Swedish) presence there, and adventures of Norwegians and Icelanders at the court of Kiev, and on the way to Byzantium, presumably inspired the setting. (Compare the extra-textual Russian connections of \\"Arrow-Odd.\\") There are excursions into Tartary, and the Aegean, but also to Halogaland (Norway), and Jotunheim, the realm of the Giants; a not untypical mixture of the known, the exotic, and the mythical.<br /><br />The volume is rounded off with two short tales, \\"Thorstein Mansion-Might\\" (\\"Thorsteins thattr baejarmagns\\"), which opens with a visit to the Underworld and an encounter with a dwarf, and continues with exploits among giants, and the very brief \\"Helgi Thorisson\\" (\\"Helga thattr Thorissonar\\"), set in the reign of King Olaf Trygvasson (995-1000). Both of these return us to King Godmund and his legendary realm of marvels and adventures, which are also attested in Saxo Grammaticus and the \\"Hervarar Saga.\\"<br /><br />Not great works -- although \\"Arrow-Odd\\" has some claims to be an especially well-told story, and the shortest works have their own compressed charm. But definitely worth having available alongside the \\"crowned masterpiece\\" examples of medieval Icelandic literature. Hermann Palsson and Paul Edwards were not wasting their time, and readers interested in giants, dwarves, and trolls, magic weapons, and the like, probably won't feel that they are wasting their time, either.	2005-04-13

I've now done some extended editing, and included additional information, so it should be more useful -- and certainly fairer to the translators.]  The story of Egil son of Grim the Bald (Skalla-Grim) is one of the prose works from medieval Iceland known as sagas, and of the major sagas it probably most closely approximates the image popularly associated with the word. The story is multi-generational (it opens in the late 850s, and extends beyond Egil's death around 990). It features Viking adventures, and its primary hero is a devotee of Odin, god of kings, warriors, and poets. The hero's grandfather is rumored to be a werewolf, and the hero, himself both warrior and skald (poet), has thrilling encounters with berserkers and assassins, and engages in a feud with a (perfectly historical) king, Eric Bloodaxe, whose wife (later the Queen-Mother) is a sorceress.  Anyone expecting the hero to be a handsome Norseman from a storybook is going to be in for a shock, though. There are several such, including Egil's beloved brother, Thorolf (named for an uncle who is the hero of the opening chapters), but, like his father, Egil himself is actually outstandingly ugly. And his behavior varies from the admirable to the repellent -- even in Viking-Age eyes. (An explanation for some of this has been proposed recently, pointing out stray details in the verse and prose that suggest a now-recognizable medical disorder, possibly genetic, known as Paget's Disease.)  The work-a-day life of medieval Iceland, with law-suits arising from it, central to the majority of the &#34;Sagas of the Icelanders,&#34; shows up only at intervals -- during Egil's childhood and, mainly, at the end of the book, during his &#34;retirement&#34; from adventuring -- as the action ranges from the Arctic Circle to England, and the central North Atlantic to the eastern Baltic.  &#34;Egil's Saga,&#34; composed in the first part of the thirteenth century about events in the ninth and tenth centuries, is thought to be among the earliest-written of the &#34;Sagas of the Icelanders,&#34; and is in some ways a good, although atypical, introduction to them. Egil's circle of friends, enemies (especially Queen-Mother Gunnhild), and immediate family members (most notably his equally formidable, if much more attractive, daughter, Thorgerd) show up in other sagas, especially &#34;Njal's Saga&#34; and &#34;Laxdaela Saga.&#34; Others concern various descendants, and their associates.  Egil was counted as an ancestor by Snorri Sturluson, the author of the &#34;Prose Edda,&#34; an explanation of myths, heroic legends and traditional verse forms, and of the &#34;Heimskringla,&#34; a massive history of Norway through biographies of its kings. Snorri is one of the few Icelandic authors of the period whose name and attributed works both survive. The temptation to assign this saga to him is understandable, and has been championed by distinguished scholars. It doesn't seem to have been shared by the medieval scribes who transmitted the text. (There have been more recent attempts to support the idea through statistical analysis of the prose style; I can't judge them either linguistically or mathematically.)  The theory was accepted by the first English translator of &#34;Egil's Saga,&#34; W.C. Green, whose version of 1893 was (inevitably) based on an obsolete edition of the text. He rendered it into a rather stuffy, and prudish, modern English, despite the more elegant examples of G.W. Dasent's &#34;Story of Burnt Njal. The Reverend Green also could not resist moralizing over &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; elements in Egil's character, in a way that would at best have amused the old pagan. (And misses the mark even more, if one accepts that theshort-tempered Egil was in pain from Paget's Disease long before other, debilitating, symptoms became marked in later years.) As for the poems, which are one of the glories of the work; let us just say that Green's English versions are lacking in any obvious merits, technical or literary.  It has the sole advantage of being out of copyright, and various versions are available on-line, including at least one which claims to have been revised to bring it closer to the Icelandic original, not least by restoring some passages omitted to avoid giving offense to Victorian sensibilities. There are various free and inexpensive E-Book versions, including one from Kindle.  Anyone reading Green's translation, even an &#34;improved&#34; version, should remember that it is NOT a perfect introduction to the sagas in general, or to this one in particular. And the saga has been fortunate in its twentieth-century translators; there have been five later renderings in English.  Green's version was followed, over a generation later, in 1930, by a careful, elaborately annotated, translation by E.R. Eddison, whose fantasy novel &#34;The Worm Ouroboros&#34; and an historical novel of Viking-Age Sweden, &#34;Styrbiorn the Strong,&#34; both had been published in the 1920s. Eddison's version greatly admired Dasent, and the team of Morris and Magnusson, whose influence is evident on every page; but he rather outdid the latter when it came to writing Icelandic-influenced prose, filled with odd syntax, and obsolete or dialect cognates of, or loan-words from, Old Norse.  Eddison's version, originally issued by Cambridge University Press, is not for everyone, but has many merits. Alas, that original printing is hard to find, and expensive, and the reprinting by Greenwood in 1968, and is not always available either.  A new, reasonably priced, reprinting has been announced by HarperCollins for 2014, along with reprintings of most of Eddison's other writings, notably annotated editions of &#34;The Worm Ouroboros&#34; and the three Zimiamvia novels. [Eddison's translation has been issued as a HarperCollins Kindle book; there is, or was, a competing Kindle edition, perhaps of dubious legitimacy, since it is still under copyright.  Now, as far as the quality of the translation goes, views are mixed. It helped that Eddison was able to use an advance text of what was then the latest scholarly edition, published in 1933, which was still the standard for the next three translations.  Eddison is rather scornful of Green, both for his bland Victorian English and his prudishness. However, Eddison's attempt to approximate the sounds and syntax of Old Norse with an English style using as many related words as possible, instead of more familiar equivalents derived from French or Latin, takes getting used to; and some people never do.  Now the sagas themselves are notable for an unadorned prose, so the very concept of Eddison's translation was criticized by scholars who reviewed it at the time -- although they added that they found that the result was better than Eddison's theory.  They did not complain that Eddison's versions of Egil's major poems (which are extremely impressive) had to be carefully annotated, because any accurate translation will badly need the explanations. The language of the skalds (the high-class poets of the medieval Scandinavian world) was esoteric and convoluted in its own time, Egil was renowned for impressively &#34;hard&#34; poems, and Eddison's choice of language and style is unquestionably appropriate for the verse, if not the prose.  It took thirty years for the next version to appear, a much more colloquial translation by Gwyn Jones, for the American-Scandinavian Foundation, was published by Syracuse University Press in 1960 (and reprinted, apparently by Twayne, in 1970), under the title &#34;Egil's Saga: Translation, Introduction, and Notes.&#34; Jones' version is less &#34;full-bodied&#34; than Eddison's, but still an impressive renderingof the saga's lean prose. (Although I can't completely agree with Christine Fell's view that his was &#34;the first readable English version.&#34;) It includes a couple of useful maps, a very good introduction, and chronology of events. In connection with the latter, he has a interesting discussion of the problems caused by Egil's brushes with English history.  Jones breaks up the prose into modern paragraphs, which makes some chapters much easier to follow (although some may find it cuts into the pell-mell pace of the story). The many short poems scattered through the text (once Egil himself appears to utter them) are sequentially numbered, as in text editions, which makes reference to them easier. The one thing missing that would make it a model translation is an index, especially of characters and places. Without such an aide, the reader is likely to miss many implied connections and motivations, as well as muddling together similar-sounding (or identical) names of several different characters.  Jones' treatment of Egil's poems is lucid, and even alliterative, but hardly even attempts to emulate Eddison's feat of producing verse in something like the original meters and diction. Some of Jones' explanatory notes are excellent; but there are many points he does not explicate.  It too, unfortunately, is out of print, but is often available, at comparatively reasonable prices. It too could do with a reprinting!  This leaves the three more recent versions. The translation, as &#34;Egils' Saga&#34; by Christine Fell, with the poems translated by John Lucas (a sensible division of labor), was published in the old Everyman's Library in 1975. It was included in Everyman Paperbacks in 1985, with some revisions, and reprinted in 1993 with additional bibliography, but seems to be out of print.  The Everyman's Library hardcover edition has a page on Amazon for used copies; I suspect copies of the paperback printings may be mixed in with other used paperbacks (from Penguin). It is not in the recent Everyman Paperback Classics series, but it deserves a reprinting. I certainly hope it gets one, since it is very readable, although I at first found the prose a little flat after long familiarity with Eddison. The notes and indexes are the closest approximation to Eddison's in a later translation, and the scholarship is obviously much more up-to-date than 1930.  Fell's end-notes supply a considerable amount of information, concisely expressed, on such things as medieval Scandinavian law and custom, making connections for the modern reader which would have been obvious for a medieval Icelander. She also provides in the notes some rather ponderous, but very enlightening, prose translations of all the poems cited, with some brief comments where necessary. (This also allows one to judge whether Lucas' renderings convey the main points.) It does have a character index, and a place-name index.  My one complaint about Fell's translation is that most chapters are presented in solid blocks of prose, with paragraphs breaks only in a few. However, I didn't really notice this until I re-read Jones' translation just after re-reading Fell, and tried to figure out why he was sometimes easier to follow. (I have no idea whether this was Fell's preference, or the publisher's decision; some text editions have paragraph breaks, some don't.)  The Fell / Lucas translation was followed immediately by a Penguin Classics version by Hermann Palsson and Paul Edwards (1976), which is quite enjoyable. The Glossary of Proper Names is a fairly good index of the characters, and the maps are usable. Footnotes provide translations of some place-names, and a few other details, but the legal issues at stake in various parts of the saga, and the major historical problems whenever Egil brushes up with documented events, cry out for annotation. I suspect that I would like it better if I had not read *after* several of the other translations.  Finally, the five-volume translation series of &#34;The Complete Saga of the Icelanders,&#34; published in 1997, includes Bernard Scudder's version of &#34;Egil's Saga.&#34; His translation takes the lead place in the Penguin Classics volume, &#34;The Sagas of the Icelanders&#34; (2000), a massive trade paperback based on &#34;The Complete Sagas.&#34; It is there one of ten sagas, and seven shorter tales. (The saga there has no separate introduction or annotations.)  It was also published as a separate volume in the Penguin Classics (2005; as &#34;Egil's Saga,&#34; of course), also available as a Kindle Book, slightly revised,and with an introduction and notes by Svanhildur Óskarsdóttir. (As of February 2014, the paperback is out of stock at Amazon.)  Scudder's version is similar in style to the Jones and Fell translations.  The chapters have paragraph divisions. It lacks a character index; and some of the decisions on how to handle dating problems in the supplied Chronology may be considered wrong-headed by some. In the Kindle edition the maps are just barely usable. The &#34;Paget's Disease&#34; theory is covered -- very briefly -- in the annotations. (The article by Jesse Byock referred to there is available on-line. In the meantime, at least one other bone disease has been mentioned as a possible alternative diagnosis.)  For those interested in a modern fiction writer's view of Egil and his associates, the late Poul Anderson's &#34;Mother of Kings&#34; is an interesting quasi-historical novel in which Egil is a major character. (I call it quasi-historical because, as Anderson warns, the story adopts attractive medieval legends about its title protagonist, Gunnhild on some key points, instead of following the historical evidence; and a fantasy interpretation, although not required, is not ruled out.).  There are aides to serious readers (and enthusiasts) available on-line. The Publications page of The Viking Society for Northern Research website offers a free download of Hines and Slay, ed., &#34;Introductory Essays on 'Egils Saga' and 'Njals Saga'&#34; (1992), in pdf format, made up of lectures directed at a university-level students. It includes a section of bibliography. There are many useful and/or interesting articles on Egil (and much else!) in the Society's journal, &#34;Saga-Book&#34; (thirty-five volumes, through 2011, are also on the publications page; volumes one through twenty-three are, as of this writing, searchable.)  Also available from the Viking Society as a free download is a new (posthumous) edition by Bjarni Einarsson of &#34;Egils Saga&#34; (2003), with an English glossary to the Icelandic text. This is not for the faint-hearted; but seeing the complexity of Egil's poetry is a fascinating experience. I find working with the pdf a bit clumsy; it was originally published in a print edition, which may still be available. (I have not seen the announced American edition from Cornell University Press, and Amazon seems unaware of its existence, if it was ever released.) Einarsson is a strong supporter of Snorri Sturluson's authorship -- including the poems attributed to Egil.  A couple of out-of-copyright nineteenth-century Old Icelandic texts of the saga are also available from archive.org, a Library of Congress website, and from Google Books. (There are also an eighteenth-century edition with a Latin translation, and a nineteenth-century Danish translation -- I haven't traced any other renderings on the archive.org site.)	2005-03-05

Davidson's book on \\"Indian Esoteric Buddhism\\" is not for those unfamiliar with the history of India or with the development of Buddhism, but it does not require advanced knowledge to follow his argument. (I would have found it unintelligible if it did.) It is also not for the devotional reader, or for anyone in search of details of religious practices, Yogic or otherwise. It is especially not for those in pursuit of salacious details of supposed Tantric practices. For those with a serious interest in the history of a great religious tradition, however, it is worth attention.  <br /> <br />Davidson outlines the complicated history of India during the centuries on either side of the first Muslim invasions, describing the internal and external warfare, the rise and fall of imperial states, the shifting of trade routes, and other political, military, and economic factors bringing about material, organizational, and ideological changes. The exposition here is probably as clear and concise as the material allows -- but I found myself wishing that Davidson had done a separate book on the subject, with adequate maps and chronologies, and summarized its conclusions here. If possible I would give it four and a half stars on this count -- I suspect that many readers will just give up before finding out what all of this has to do with esoteric Buddhism. (A lot, if you accept Davidson's argument, but for a while it has to be taken on faith, so to speak.)  <br /> <br />The declining status of women, particularly their place in public religion, is given considerable attention. Not out of a desire to be trendy or politically correct -- it turns out to be an important, and measurable, indication of social and political changes. <br /> <br />Archeological and iconographic evidence is used when available; fieldwork in India and Pakistan has suffered from delayed publication. Studies of popular religion in modern India are also used, including Davidson's own investigations. Some patterns of religious devotion seem to persist, regardless of the official religion prevailing at this or another time. <br /> <br />Davidson applies this picture to the emergence of new and radical strains in Indian Buddhism and Hinduism during this long and turbulent period. He argues, convincingly, that disruption of the great monastic institutions around which Indian Buddhism had been built allowed for personal forms of religiosity to emerge. Some of these, which we know as \\"Tantra,\\" had a great future within Mahayana Buddhism, but mainly outside of India, in the Tibetan and Chinese cultural zones (the latter including Korea and Japan). Other responses probably vanished without a trace, or survive as apparent aberrations in better-attested schools of thought. <br /> <br />Davidson emphasizes that similar trends appeared in Hinduism during the same period, and argues that the esoteric traditions influenced each other in complex and subtle ways, some of which he explores. The old problem of whether Hindu or Buddhist Tantra is the \\"original\\" form fades, if both are seen as responses to the same stresses and changes. <br /> <br />Davidson argues that organized Indian Buddhism suffered in the long term by abandoning its own traditions of philosophy, and adapting its arguments to the prevailing concerns of the time. Although this produced some interesting philosophy, the shift from salvation to epistemology was bound to weaken the appeal of Buddhism as a religion in a time of upheaval. This loss of emotional impact also helps to explain the infiltration of new and radical forms of meditation and ritual into the monastic movement itself. <br /> <br />Davidson also looks at the literary forms of Buddhist Tantras, and their use of paradoxes, and what can only be called scandalous whimsy, as preaching devices; aspects which are often explained away, or decried, but make good sense in the setting he proposes. His comments on specific texts are excellent, and one wishesthere were more of them, instead of just what is sufficient to carry the argument. <br /> <br />I found the book fascinating, although not easy going at times. The emergence of new religious forms is often explained as a result of processes internal to the religion in question, and often blamed on the representatives of the old ways. Davidson's argument that external factors can play an equally important role suggests taking a new look at popular mystical movements in other religions. For western Christianity, a comparable work, although from a very different starting point, is Norman Cohn's \\"Pursuit of the Millennium,\\" which argued for the close relationship between social and economic issues and religious movements in the later Middle Ages. Some of the \\"libertine\\" movements he describes have a certain resemblance to various manifestations of the Tantric movements in both Hinduism and Buddhism. Also consider, for example, the relation of the rise of Hasidism in the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe to the catastrophic decline of the Polish state, rather than the supposed failures of the established Jewish leadership.  <br /> <br />(Reposted from my \\"anonymous\\" review of June 19, 2003.)	2005-03-03
US	30081986	R2BJPJTN2MRJG7	1573924490	770241826	Moses	Books	5	20	21	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Buber's Exodus and Wilderness	\\"Moses,\\" usually published as \\"Moses: The Revelation and the Covenant,\\"  is probably the most readable of Martin Buber's longer Biblical studies. It combines a sense of narrative movement with ingenious interpretations (often backed by formidable, if now obsolete, scholarship, almost always tucked away in endnotes), rhapsodies on freedom and the desert, reflections on the experiences described as miracles, and some hard political thought. For those familiar with traditional Jewish biblical interpretation, its influence on Buber's thought, and his willingness to work out implications by suggesting supplements to the biblical narrative, will be apparent. This combination makes \\"Moses\\" interesting to read, but difficult to classify. (It may also be a surprise to those who know Buber only from the philosophy of  \\"I and Thou,\\" or the story-telling of \\"Tales of the Hasidim.\\")<br /><br />Together with a much more difficult book by Buber, \\"The Kingship of God,\\" it presents early Israelite religion as including a revolutionary social movement, egalitarian and anti-state, yet demanding accountability and public order. Similar ideas, usually less attractively expressed, and often less carefully nuanced, began to appear in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and in some cases remain influential. Buber's priority is not always acknowledged. Of course it is easy to believe that the ferment of their time was as influential on these interpreters as the first part of the twentieth century was on Buber, and that they came to their conclusions independently. Buber's \\"The Prophetic Faith\\" deals with the Genesis narratives, some of the Prophets, and Job, and for much of its length is less obviously political; in some ways, his study of modern socialist movements, \\"Paths in Utopia,\\" is at least as closely related.<br /><br />Some readers, looking for traditional religious edification, will probably find Buber's presentation too rationalistic and secular. I am sure that there are those who will be upset by Buber's interpretation of Moses asking God for His true name, and the unhelpful answer, as showing the influence of Egyptian name magic. Others, encouraged at first by the footnotes and the assumption that the biblical text cannot be taken literally, will find him, well, too religious. If you approach \\"Moses\\" as the work of a religious philosopher with a strong interest in social issues, and a willingness to take the ancient text very seriously, but not literally, you will find much of interest.<br /><br />(Reposted from my \\"anonymous\\" review of June 15, 2003.)	2005-02-05
US	30081986	R1D2OZ1IQUY90U	0486233723	545825372	Outlines of Chinese Symbolism and Art Motives (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)	Books	5	20	21	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Beautiful Antique	This volume is listed as a \\"third edition\\" and dated 1976, which suggests it is fairly recent. In fact, except for correction of \\"obvious printing errors,\\" it reproduces the 1941 Shanghai edition of a book published in Peking (Beijing) in 1931 as \\"Outlines of Chinese Symbolism,\\" and previously revised in 1932. The full title of Williams' final version is \\"Outlines of Chinese Symbolism and Art Motives: an alphabetical compendium of antique legends and beliefs, as reflected in the manners and customs of the Chinese.\\" As reproduced by Dover Publications in 1976, with 401 illustrations (including color plates on the inside covers), it is an extremely attractive volume, packed with information, and reasonably well arranged. It looks like everything an ordinary curious reader could want; and I have found nothing quite comparable to it, at least in English, although there are now excellent studies of particular symbols and concepts. (Eberhard's \\"Dictionary of Chinese Symbols\\" has a different focus.) It is still cited in reputable works by professional Sinologists, along with Williams' \\"Manual of Chinese Metaphor\\" (1920).    There are other reprintings besides that by Dover; it also appears in hardcover and paperback editions as \\"Chinese Symbolism and Art Motifs\\" (note the modernized spelling), and \\"Encyclopedia of Chinese symbolism and art motives.\\" There may be some other variations on the title that I have missed.    Under any title, it should, however, be used with caution; a useful resource to someone with the necessary background can be a snare for the rest of us. Described by Dover as the \\"work of a scholarly English resident of China,\\" it does not seem to reflect professional skills as a Sinologist, and frequently reports information at second or third hand, some of it already antiquated in 1921. Williams' own observations are interesting, but largely restricted to North China, mainly Peking and its vicinity (to Williams, very properly for the time, Peiping), and various Western enclaves on the coast. It is to Williams' credit, however, that he at least tries to include some Chinese popular culture, rather than just the idealized official versions. It is a reflection of the time that he actually rather apologizes for including Buddhist (therefore \\"foreign\\") and Taoist (to the elite as well as the missionaries, \\"superstitious\\") as well as Confucian symbols and concepts.    Those who have read much about China will soon notice that the transliterations are inconsistent, and sometimes very odd, at times corresponding to no system that is readily apparent. This is particularly common in Williams' quotations from his sources. I suspect that a mixture of the use of spoken vernaculars and \\"classical\\" pronunciation in those sources, alongside differing transliteration systems themselves, is responsible; Williams doesn't seem to have made a clear statement of his approach to this problem (or I missed it). Apparently he used the Wade-Giles himself, but didn't try to impose it on quotations. In a world of books then already littered with German, French, Dutch, English, and other systems for alphabetical renderings of Chinese, and now with the continuing use of the old Wade-Giles system alongside the \\"official\\" Pinyin, both with variants, this is a real nuisance, although usually not more than that. (It would be nice if, in some future edition, a qualified person supplied current Romanized renderings for the Chinese characters; and possibly the modern, simplified form; but it doesn't seem likely.)    More serious is Williams' sometimes free-and-easy use of materials without, apparently, checking their ultimate origin, so that his impressive citations can't always be taken at face value. (In addition, his references to nineteenth-century academic journals are of little practical help today, although inevitable when the book was first published.) In one extreme case, the result is rather amusing. Williams mentions that the standard versionof the \\"Willow Pattern\\" design on porcelain was invented in England in the eighteenth century, and copied for the foreign market by Chinese manufacturers. But he then reproduces a long, romantic, story explaining it, without making it quite clear that the story is also a Western concoction, containing only a few Chinese elements, which he does identify. This leaves the impression that it is, at whatever remove, and however freely, translated from a Chinese source. Robert H. van Gulik, diplomat, scholar, and novelist, later incorporated the outlines of the tale into his Judge Dee mystery, \\"The Willow Pattern,\\" explaining the situation in a Postscript, which cites Williams as a readily available source for the story. The Chinese translation of his novel, he pointed out, would introduce the supposedly Chinese story to the Chinese language....     Wherever there is overlap in coverage, I try to check Williams against Wolfram Eberhard's \\"A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols,\\" which, among its other merits, often mentions whether a particular concept is common Chinese, regional, local, or associated mainly with minority cultures; an issue often ignored by Williams and his sources, including missionaries and merchants who took the groups they were working with as perfect representatives of Chinese culture. Of course, the same problem was found among serious scholars, who often described everything about the better-educated Chinese they came in contact with as \\"typical\\" until told that it wasn't; and tended to regard it at as in any case more genuine than the beliefs of the vast majority of Chinese. Williams' industry was admirable; one wishes the product of it had gone through further revision.	2005-01-31

Ford's &#34;The Mabinogi, and Other Medieval Welsh Tales&#34; is the most recent version to be published in book form, and, despite being a variant selection of material, is in some ways the most satisfactory. Patrick Ford gives a clear and vigorous rendering, with an excellent introduction and notes. He does not try to make the medieval texts sound up-to-date, but he doesn't strive for quaintness, either (the stories are quite strange enough!). Typically, he restores the correct &#34;Mabinogi,&#34; instead of the enshrined scribal error in the nineteenth-century title of 'The Mabinogion.&#34; (According to Eric P. Hamp's &#34;Mabinogi and Archaism,&#34; in &#34;Celtica&#34; Volume 23 [1999], even the manuscript form &#34;mabinogi&#34; is problematic for other reasons!)<br /><br />I have reviewed the nineteenth-century translation by Lady Charlotte Guest, whose failure to recognize a scribal slip created the collective title of &#34;Mabinogion&#34; for a diverse group of tales, and the standard modern translation by Gwyn Jones and Thomas Jones, which, following a little-known predecessor from 1929, created the standard modern &#34;canon&#34; of these stories by dropping one of Charlotte Guest's selections, and evaluated these older translations there. The Jones and Jones list was followed in Jeffrey Gantz's translation for the Penguin Classics, which appeared about a year before Ford's translation of &#34;The Mabinogi, and Other Medieval Welsh Tales,&#34; and I have discussed it briefly in comparison with the Jones and Jones version.<br /><br />[Nov. 6, 2017: I happened to check on this rather old review of mine, and discovered that I had never updated it -- or my other Mabinogion reviews -- to include a mention of Sioned Davies' excellent translation from Oxford University Press (2007). It is currently available as both an Oxford World's Classics paperback and a Kindle book. I keep meaning to review it, but have never gotten around to it....]<br /><br />Although the Jones and Jones translation has been the &#34;Revised Standard Version&#34; of &#34;The Mabinogion&#34; for half a century, during which it underwent several revisions to keep the scholarship up to date, Ford's version has several advantages, not all of which are immediately evident; I would suggest that anyone with a serious interest in Celtic literature, or even a strong curiosity, read, and if possible own, both.<br /><br />Patrick Ford, then at UCLA, and later at Harvard, dropped five stories, three of which were influenced by, if not copied from, French sources, and restored the missing tale, which he had re-edited from the manuscripts, and published separately. Ford's translation, therefore, contains stories in three of the four usual categories. (Note that preferred spellings of proper names vary, and I have not tried to be fully consistent.)<br /><br />First, &#34;The Four Branches of the Mabinogi,&#34; from which the collective title was derived, consisting of &#34;Pwyll, Prince of Dyved,&#34; Branwen Daughter of Llyr,&#34; &#34;Manawydan Son of Llyr,&#34; and &#34;Math Son of Mathonwy.&#34; These begin with a story about the conception and birth of Pwyll's son, Pryderi, whose death is one of the early events in the &#34;Fourth Branch,&#34; and concern a variety of heroes, and what are clearly rationalized gods. (Evangeline Walton turned each of the &#34;Four Branches&#34; into a novel; and other writers have done versions of one or another of them.)<br /><br />Second, there are two &#34;native tales,&#34; &#34;The Dream of Maxen Wledig&#34; and &#34;The Story of Lludd and Lleuelys,&#34; about Roman (&#34;historical&#34;) and pre-Roman (&#34;mythical&#34;) Britain as imagined by the medieval Welsh. The 'Lludd&#34; text, as we have it, actually belongs to the &#34;Chronicle&#34; tradition launched by Geoffrey of Monmouth's supposed translation from an &#34;ancient British book.&#34; (Which, if any part of it ever had any existence, was NOT the &#34;Mabinogion.&#34;) The name of Lludd seems to be Welsh variant of a Celtic divine name, &#34;Nuada&#34; in Irish, &#34;Nodens&#34; in old British inscriptions, and &#34;Nudd&#34; in other Welsh sources; the variation seems to be due to assimilation to his epithet, Llaw Eraint, &#34;Silver Hand,&#34; which is explained in the Irish tale of how the physician of the Gods made new hand for  Nuada Argatlam.&#34; (H.P. Lovecraft picked up &#34;Nodens&#34; for the Cthulhu Mythos, a use which is unrelated; but Tolkien, whose hero Beren also lost a hand, actually wrote an early article on the Nodens inscriptions, and the apparent offerings of metal hands.) He may be behind King Lud, the supposed eponym of London. As Ford points out, Lleuellys, usually given as Llevellys, and also modernized as Llefellys, clearly should be read as Lleu-ellys, and recognized as a version of the god Lugh: the name Lleu is also used for a character in the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi.<br /><br />&#34;Maxen,&#34; in which a Roman Emperor seeks as his wife a princess seen in a dream, seems to reflect an even more garbled version of a story known to Geoffrey, compounding several real people, including Helen, the mother of the Emperor Constantine. She was, in a medieval confusion compounding an honest mistake with local patriotism, believed to be British, and identified with &#34;Elen of the Hosts.&#34; Ford drops this, as it seems to contain a rather high proportion of medieval hagiography and romance, and a very low proportion of archaic Welsh tradition.<br /><br />Third are two Arthurian stories in native Welsh mode. &#34;Culhwch and Olwen,&#34; is an elaborate quest, dragging in, at least by name, most of the gods and heroes traceable in Welsh material, and some of their Irish cousins into the bargain, mostly as part of Arthur's court.<br /><br />&#34;The Dream of Rhonabwy&#34; is a visionary encounter with Arthur and his warriors (and anything else I could say would probably be controversial); a fascinating text, which, after a very grittily realistic opening, almost boasts of its authentically dreamlike obscurity. It breaks off in a manner most modern readers will find unsatisfactory -- and its arbitrary nature may have been part of the point. Ford does not include it; a pity, but it is probably the least readable part of the collection.<br /><br />Ford also does not translate the fourth group, the three &#34;Romances,&#34; &#34;Owain&#34; (otherwise known as &#34;The Lady of the Fountain&#34;), &#34;Peredur son of Evrawc,&#34; and &#34;Gereint the Son of Erbin,&#34; the first and last of which are clearly versions of Chretien de Troyes' Old French Arthurian Romances, &#34;Yvain&#34; and &#34;Erec,&#34; while the second is related in a more complex manner to his unfinished and problematic &#34;Perceval le Gallois.&#34; These seem to illustrate Celtic materials going out into wider European society, and then flowing back into Wales to enrich (and confuse) the native heroic and mythic tradition with ideas of chivalry.<br /><br />The story missing from the three other modern translations [now four, including the Davies translation] was published by Charlotte Guest as &#34;The Tale of Taliesin,&#34; but it is also found in some manuscripts as two separate tales. Although attested rather late, there are Irish parallels, and its tradition would seem to belong very much with the &#34;native tales&#34; like the &#34;Four Branches of the Mabinogi&#34; and &#34;Culhwch.&#34; There seems to have been a real Taliesin, an early medieval poet, to whom much-later poems were also attributed, but this story-complex has more to do with the myths about the nature of poetry. (It is also behind Thomas Love Peacock's comic novel, &#34;The Misfortunes of Elphin,&#34; and quite a bit of modern fantasy literature.)<br /><br />The version of &#34;Taliesin,&#34; based, as noted earlier, on the text Ford had re-edited from manuscripts, is restored to its two-story version, as &#34;The Tale of Gwion Bach&#34; and &#34;The Tale of Taliesin,&#34; and includes reliable versions of the poems attributed to the variously-reborn hero. Again, there was a real Taliesin, a dark-age Bard, according to Welsh tradition; but these poems, like the stories, are pretty much independent of anything he may have actually composed. But they *may* reflect some very archaic ideas about the magical nature of poetry, which were old when the real Taliesin was alive.<br /><br />The absence of the tale(s) from other twentieth-century translations seems to be due to the fact that Charlotte Guest's text for the story (with poems) had passed through the hands of the notorious Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams, 1747-1826). Iolo was a Welsh and local patriot, and a pioneering scholar who may have known more about medieval Welsh than anyone in his lifetime. Unhappily, he didn't hesitate to *invent* evidence to support his theories (and promote his own district in Wales), and Charlotte Guest was only one of the nineteenth-century writers he had led astray. Since the other copies of the Taliesin story were all obviously late, there had been little incentive to plunge into that thicket.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Guest version of Taliesin had been worked over by Robert Graves for his brilliant, and absurd, &#34;The White Goddess,&#34; and a reliable version for non-Celticists was more than overdue. Ford's text edition was of value for another reason; there are close parallels between the stories of Gwion and the boyhood of the Irish hero Fionn (Finn McCool), investigation of which certainly needed a proper edition of the Welsh version to work from, even if they were considered examples of late borrowings instead of a common heritage.<br /><br />As an added bonus for readers of his &#34;The Mabinogi,&#34; Ford included as an appendix a translation of the notoriously difficult &#34;Cad Goddeu,&#34; or &#34;Battle of the Trees,&#34; also found in Guest's notes. It too had been given a splendid, and absurd, interpretation in terms of the Irish Ogham script by Robert Graves, who demonstrated his profound lack of knowledge of Welsh, and equally deep understanding of Irish. (Graves actually &#34;improved&#34; and re-ordered the translation he was using, without reference to the original....) Ford doesn't claim to understand its &#34;real meaning,&#34; if any, only what it actually says, and it is very nice to have it.

US	30081986	R9MFIDDCTENP2	0415002281	132257197	Dictionary of Chinese Symbols: Hidden Symbols in Chinese Life and Thought (Routledge Dictionaries)	Books	5	26	26	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Revealing Meaning	\\"A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols\\" is the work of Wolfram Eberhard (1909-1989)  A German-born Sinologist and sociologist, and  a political refugee from Hitler, he spent eleven years in Turkey introducing Sinology to that country at Ankara University, and then most of the rest of his career (1948-1976) at the University of California at Berkeley, in the then-new Department of Sociology. He published in German, English, and Turkish, on both standard Sinological subjects and Chinese and comparative folklore, and the local cultures of China and adjacent areas. His \\"Dictionary of Chinese Symbols\\" is based on a lifetime of study, and an unusual diversity of experience.    The bulk of Eberhard's publications (thirty-five books, 195 articles, 300-some book reviews) are usually fairly technical, or, if popular, rapidly becoming obsolete. (His \\"History of China,\\" first published in German in 1948, was last revised in 1977, just before an explosion of archeological and other work.) However, his \\"Folktales of China\\" (1965), part of University of Chicago Press series aimed at both college students and the general public, should be accessible to most readers, if a copy is available. The present volume was also apparently aimed at a wider public, although it was well-received by Sinologists.     The 1983 German edition of \\"Lexicon chinesischer Symbole,\\" translated by G. L. Campbell, as \\"A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols,\\" was his last major work. It is the condensed -- in some ways perhaps too condensed -- product of a lifetime of study. It is organized not around the meaning of Chinese art motifs as such, but around the symbolic associations of the written characters of classical China, with their fully pictorial counterparts as supporting data; and it includes primarily verbal symbolisms as well. (More exactly, while the Chinese script isn't pictographic, some pictures are \\"read\\" as if they were phonetic  -- so that a picture of a \\"lu\\" (a deer), which often stands for \\"longevity,\\"may also be seen instead as \\"the exact phonetic equivalent\\" word \\"lu\\" meaning \\"good income,\\" and interpreted as \\"riches\\" instead (see Deer, page 79, and cross-references.)    It is primarily historical, and, inevitably, very selective: \\"no more than an introduction to the subject,\\" according to the author. A topic is always given its Chinese character, or set of characters; and many are illustrated from traditional art, mostly reproduced rather well. Eberhard uses the traditional, or \\"full\\" forms of Chinese characters, rather than the recent simplified forms, pointing out that the symbolic associations may depends on the perceived imagery of at least part of the character, as well as on, or in addition to, its phonetic reading. (He doesn't get into the real history, which may be different, given shifts in the spoken language and development of the written forms.)    Eberhard does use survival of ideas into modern times -- by which he apparently means the first part of the twentieth century -- as an important criterion of selection. There is, however, no attempt made to include specifically *modern* China, whether the mainland or Taiwan, in any systematic way. The reader who is interested in classic Chinese literature, or traditional art probably will be far better served than those interested in twentieth-century innovations or drastic adaptations. A history encompassing millennia is given priority over recent decades. But, if modernity as such is given short shrift, Eberhard often notes the geographic and cultural distribution of a concept or image within China, instead of offering an impression of \\"all Chinese ... at all times.\\" To those without access to the primary and secondary sources (the latter of which include some of Eberhard's own publications), this feature is very important all by itself.     First published at a time when the mainland government was pressing the claims of its official \\"Pinyin\\" system for Romanizing Chinese as the international standard, the transliteration used in the book, at least in its English-language version, represents a compromise. It uses the character set of Pinyin, instead of the old Wade-Giles system (or a German equivalent), but breaks up the long polysyllabic forms of the official version with hyphens, in the Wade-Giles manner. This is, I am sure, annoying to those who know and like the Pinyin system, but it is a practical compromise. The uninitiated, faced by, say, \\"huijiaotu\\" (Muslims) are, I would think, at least as likely to try pronouncing it as huiji-aot-u as they are to read it as hui-jiao-tu, the form given here.     Eberhard was very much aware of theoretical issues, and raises some in his brief Introduction, which deals with written Chinese as itself a symbolic system. He mentions, with regret, that he was not able to include the symbolic systems of Chinese craftsmen, and explains that Buddhist and Taoist symbols are included only if they are meaningful to ordinary Chinese. He adds that the full range of Chinese symbolism, and its functions, remains to be explored and evaluated, but he does not turn a dictionary into a vehicle for promulgating his own theories.     The main purpose of the \\"Dictionary\\" is to present useful information in a condensed fashion. It succeeds at this quite brilliantly. While not as all-encompassing as Williams' antiquated (and not always reliable) \\"Outlines of Chinese Symbolism,\\" and lacking the sheer beauty of Fang Jing Pei's \\"Symbols and Rebuses in Chinese Art: Figures, Bugs, Beasts, and Flowers,\\" it is dense with relevant, and authentic, information. The simple indication of a cross-reference, an arrow pointing at the head-word of another article, is usually less distracting than common alternatives, such as the use of italics, small capitals, or boldface, although in a few articles their abundance becomes an obstacle to reading.	2005-01-31

Her \\"Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion\\" (1903) had a good reception among the scholars who dominated work in ancient Greek religion in the first half of the twentieth century, but its sequel, \\"Themis: A Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion\\" (1912), had to wait decades for appreciation, by which time its use of social anthropology was more than beginning to show its age. Awareness of her work may be strongest among: (a) feminists; and (b) those interested in the myth-and-ritual \\"school\\" with which, along with Gilbert Murray and F. M. Cornford, she is generally associated. (This \\"Cambridge School\\" is a debatable grouping, since its suppposed members had different agendas, and went their own ways, but the designation is a sort of \\"cultural fact\\" in itself.) Jane Harrison also wrote a small body of personal reflections, more intriguing than revealing. The development of her public image, and its relation to reality, is the \\"invention\\" that provides this book its focus.    A biography by her friend and collaborator Hope Mirrlees was announced not long after her death in 1928, but never appeared. A full treatment had to wait for Sandra J. Peacock's \\"Jane Ellen Harrison: The Mask and the Self,\\" in 1988, which revealed a good deal more than earlier sketches. These tended to be laudatory, or else dismissive remarks on the obsolete views of a dead colleague. Harrison had left no students in professional posts to defend their teacher, her male proteges having been part of the generation lost to World War I. Meanwhile, some of her opponents moved into influential positions, or simply passed on their hostility to their own students.    Beard attempts a re-evaluation of Harrison's life, career, and place in the history of classical studies. Parts of her presentation of academic infighting and jealousies seem tofascinate those already familiar with the players, or interested in group dynamics, and evidently bore others, but these accounts, based on ample documentation, seem more solid than her speculations about Harrison's closely-guarded inner life. Beard's reflections on the muddled evidence and the myth-making process at work in official biographies will be of interest mostly to those already acquainted with the literature.     A major problem with Beard's argument is that so much of Harrison's posthumous reputation rests on people and movements outside the circle of professional classicists. E. S. Strong, her preferred rival for Harrison's position as a leading woman in the academic world of the time, was a hard-working archeologist specializing in early Italy. Besides the problem of associating with the Fascist regime during the years in which Harrison's posthumous public reputation was being promoted by her friends, Strong was not dealing with matters of great interest to a wide public. Harrison, with her analysis of Greek myth and religion in terms of basic human needs and anxieties, and her use of ancient popular culture and superstitions to re-interpret familiar classics, was surely a better candidate as a heroine whose work, while sometimes difficult to follow, was often exciting. I found Beard's work informative, and frequently very interesting, but too narrowly focussed to explain Harrison's continuing prestige.     Since I originally read this volume, it has gone into a paperback edition, much more reasonably priced for its length; in this format, it may be more attractive to those interested in the history of classical scholarship, women in academic life, and several other topics with which Mary Beard deals.

US	30081986	R19HT4JJ32YR60	0226059782	275250412	001: Feudal Society, Volume 1: The Growth of Ties of Dependence	Books	5	87	90	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Modern Classic, Not Yet Out-Moded	I suppose I should be of two minds about Marc Bloch's \\"Feudal Society,\\" a French work from the late 1930s which became available in English in the early 1960s, and was still fresh and exciting back when I was taking a freshman course on \\"Western Civilization.\\" In theory, the book (and it is one book, although published in paperback in two volumes) has two major drawbacks. In practice, I find it solid, admirable, and well worth reading.    One drawback is the author's romantic glorification of the medieval peasant -- Norman Cantor has called attention to this in his \\"Inventing the Middle Ages,\\" pointing out that Bloch gave it Marxist trappings. I call it romantic because I suspect that Bloch owed at least as much to Jules Michelet's nineteenth-century historiography, initially with a veneer of \\"science\\" added. Of course, Bloch actually went out and did fundamental work in the archives, and tried to get a real picture of how, in the long term, life had been lived by ordinary people, instead of relying on Michelet-style suppositions. (Yes, Bloch's \\"Annales\\" school is supposed to be the antithesis of the enthusiastic Michelet; but, while Bloch established its methodology in reaction to existing approaches, in Bloch's last book \\"The Historian's Craft,\\" Michelet is still among \\"our great forebears.\\")    The second is the concept of \\"Feudalism\\" itself, which these days makes anyone with a serious background in medieval studies very uncomfortable. A very good case can be made that \\"Feudalism\\" is largely a set of modern constructs, re-invented several times since the sixteenth century to suit different legal, political, and social purposes, and presented as an \\"Historic Fact\\" alongside contemporary and later \\"discoveries\\" such as \\"Anglo-Saxon Liberty,\\" \\"The Norman Yoke,\\" and \\"Our Ancestors the Gauls.\\" (A short, pointed, introduction to one aspect of the problem is J.G.A. Pocock's \\"The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law: A Study of English Historical Thought in the Seventeenth Century.\\")    If it means anything for modern-day historians, the term applies to how control of land, and its revenue, was linked to social status, political authority, judicial functions, and reciprocal military obligations -- a large, messy, topic. So the feeling is growing that the word is best avoided, as carrying too much baggage, and too likely to be invoked as a substitute for thought.    Indeed, as picked up by Karl Marx, Feudalism, equated largely with landlord-tenant agriculture instead of sub-divided political and judicial authority, became a theoretical concept to be applied to a variety of extra-European societies, as a stage in an inevitable social evolution. In this role, it produced, or at least became a part of, bitter, and literally murderous, disputes over the nature of Russian and Chinese society, among others.    Even with all this in mind, and many years after first reading it, I find Bloch's emphasis on the material basis of medieval society refreshing, and think that he carried it out with reasonable consistency. Whatever his agenda, he went looking for real data, and adjusted theory to match it, which is where he parts company with both Michelet and Marx. That later work has revealed a more complex, and in some ways different, picture does not discredit his effort. And having the hardworking peasant as a sort of collective hero helps hold together discussions of things like field rotation, strip cultivation, and plough-teams, which most readers will not find all that gripping on their own.    More important, in some ways, Bloch presented feudal *society* -- not some imaginary entity called \\"Feudalism\\" or \\"The Feudal System\\" -- as a whole set of ways of ordering people and institutions, and making resources available to various parts of a diversified ruling class. The unsystematic nature of actuality is not denied, but it is classified in terms of common elements.    This getting down to practical realities may not sound so impressive, but a couple of generations of scholars had been smacking each other over the head (in this case, figuratively) in an argument of whether \\"Feudalism\\" was *really* Roman or Germanic, with partisan sub-divisions on whether either origin was a Good Thing or a Bad Thing. Somehow, figuring out how it worked had seemed less important than what Mircea Eliade called \\"The Prestige of Origins\\" -- a form of mythical thought as much as a topic of historical research.    So instead of a broad theory of a single \\"origin,\\" we get \\"The Growth of Ties of Dependence\\" (volume one of the paperback edition), followed by \\"Social Classes and Political Organization,\\" showing the extent to which the pattern of rural hierarchies did, or did not, carry over into \\"higher\\" or \\"more advanced\\" developments.    Although probably much more accurate for France than for other parts of Europe, and for some centuries more than others, the book does manage to present a (by and large) convincing picture of how Europe re-organized itself between the collapse of Rome and the High Middle Ages. A reminder of the people who made it all possible, but were usually left out of the chronicles, and certainly are missing from most of the chansons de geste and romances, is not a bad basis for a book.    Still, largely for reasons of documentation, Bloch is sometimes rather better at explaining how the military aristocracy was supported, than at presenting the daily lives of the people who were doing the work. His analysis of how some knights and officials had \\"fiefs\\" which were simply stipends, or even what we might consider cafeteria privileges, is an interesting sidelight to \\"life on a medieval manor\\" approaches. It also reveals that methods of supporting the clergy and the nobility were not all that different, which shouldn't be a big surprise, given the limited options available.    So I continue to think of Bloch's \\"Feudal Society\\" as a valuable contribution, to be read and pondered, although not taken at face value, by anyone seriously interested in medieval European society, or supposedly comparable systems elsewhere. Since it has also generated a half-century of follow-ups, attacks, and defenses, it is also a good book to have read as part of getting acquainted with a wider literature.	2005-01-28

Lady Charlotte Guest was a daughter of the ninth Earl of Lindsey, and so a member of the English upper class. Born in 1812, she came to Wales as the wife of John Guest, an ironmaster and member of parliament, and while residing there began to work on translating a number of stories from medieval and early modern Welsh manuscripts, eventually published in seven volumes, 1838-1845, as \\"The Mabinogion.\\" (The title is itself a mistake, but now so embedded in usage that it may never be eradicated.) It was very aristocratic way of involving herself in Welsh culture, and certainly avoided many of the grubby realities, although that may not have been what she intended.     She was not the first translator of some of the stories, and she had assistance, but, considering that she was starting from learning Welsh to begin with, her industry is impressive, and the literary success of her project well deserved -- Tennyson was only one of her admirers. The stories she translated have, with minor variations, become a canonical set: she used pretty much every example of early secular Welsh narrative that wasn't either plainly historical or clearly a straightforward translation from another language. Her version was, and is, widely read, and has helped form a vision of Welsh (and generally Celtic) literature of considerable influence -- not all of it good.     Her husband's death, and her involvement in managing his business, another extraordinary effort for a proper early-Victorian Lady, took Charlotte Guest away from medieval Welsh studies; from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. After her remarriage to Charles Schreiber (her son's tutor, another interesting story), she turned her energies in a third direction, the collection of ceramics. (To my considerable annoyance, the modern editor of her journals considered this of far, far more importance than either the iron industry or that Welsh literature stuff, and omitted much of both to make room for descriptions of buyingfine porcelain ... .) She then went on to become on expert on fans, as well. Much more ladylike, I'm sure; except that she also became an authority on their construction. A really remarkable person, deserving of respect.     This is relevant because, although she lived until 1895, her work on medieval Welsh effectively came to an end a half-century before, and was that of a devoted amateur even then. The translation was not only based on poorly-edited texts, imperfectly understood: in accordance with the practice of the time, she omitted, or at least veiled in obscure phrasing, whatever she found morally offensive, and cut or expanded descriptions, and, generally produced a work that, except on the level of graceful writing, has not stood up well.     Add that early nineteenth-century Welsh studies were plagued by the hand of Iolo Morganwg, who combined real learning with a taste for fraud, and you will realize that what she says may be not only obsolete, but a good-faith repetition of falsified texts, or complete fabrications. (For example, Iolo wrote two sets of Welsh Triads to go along with the real ones; his versions are still being quoted by the unaware, the careless, and those who can't bear to give up a convenient lie.)     However, Charlotte Guest's \\"Mabinogion\\" is long out of copyright, which seems to guarantee it a place in some publishers' lists.     Editions which include at least some of the notes she provided still have some value as representing early nineteenth-century knowledge of Welsh literature in the English-speaking world. The 1906 Everyman's Library edition is an example of this approach; a small (mass-market paperback size) hardcover, based on a one-volume edition of 1877, it was almost 450 pages long. In fact, a full, critical edition of her work would probably be of great importance to Victorian studies.    The edition illustrated by Alan Lee reportedly includes Guest's notes; if so, it must be a striking combination of modern fantasy artand useful resource. Stories-only editions of the Guest translation, however inexpensive, are of much less, even dubious, value. The reader may think, \\"so this is what it is like,\\" when it isn't.    Still, a searchable digital text is an enormous convenience, so long as it isn't mistaken for something definitive, or even very reliable. And a convenient paperback, like the Dover Thrift Edition, is probably a great convenience for readers of Tennyson, and a lot of early twentieth-century Celtic and Arthurian fiction (although even for this, her notes are sometimes of equal or greater importance).     For those with any real interest in the subject, three other translations are available. Gwyn Jones and Thomas Jones translated \\"The Mabinogion\\" in the 1940s, and their version replaced Guest's in the Everyman's Library series in 1949. After several revisions, it remains in print, in hardcover (Knopf) and paperback (Everyman Paperback Classics). I have reviewed the paperback edition of this at some length.     More recent is Jeffrey Gantz's \\"The Mabinogion\\" for Penguin Classics (1976), which is more modern in language. Like Jones and Jones (and a now-unavailable 1929 translation), Gantz omits one of Guest's selections, \\"The Tale of Taliesin.\\" He also departs from the usual spelling of some characters' names, for reasons which do not seem entirely clear. As prose, it doesn't seem to me close to Jones and Jones, and well behind Guest, but some people seem to prefer it.     Finally, we come to \\"The Mabinogi, and Other Medieval Welsh Tales,\\" edited and translated by Patrick K. Ford (1977), which drops the common title, and with it three heavily French-influenced tales, and two other stories with debatable features, but restores \\"Taliesin,\\" re-edited from manuscripts not subjected to Iolo Morganwg's meddling; in his version, it appears in two parts, \\"The Tale of Gwion Bach\\" and \\"The Tale of Taliesin.\\" He also includes a translation of \\"Cad Goddeu,\\" or \\"The Battle of the Trees,\\" an unsatisfactory version of which Charlotte Guest had used in her notes. Ford's introductions are clear and informative; and he was acutely aware of the modern literary uses of the stories. (I know this last because I was taking a course from him while the translation was in draft.) The translation doesn't try to make a medieval text sound more modern than it is, but it doesn't try to make it quaint or archaic, either.     With any of these available to you, Charlotte Guest's translation will make an interesting supplement. One thing it doesn't lack is charm.	2005-01-22

It is not about religion as such, nor mysticism or magic; you can put those meanings of the word aside. It has been called by this title ever since a first-century B.C. editor decided to place it *after* Aristotle's \\"Physica\\" (On Nature). Aristotle seems to have called it \\"First Philosophy,\\" which now suggests something introductory, as well as of first importance. Aristotle also sometimes describes it as \\"Theology,\\" which is also rather misleading, although he does talk about a concept of what he considers divinity. The concept has little connection to most people's way of regarding religion, although Muslim, Jewish, and Christian Aristotelians all did their best to reconcile it with their ideas of what \\"theology\\" should be, sometimes with help from Neo-Platonist interpretations.<br /><br />No valid presentation is going to make it easy to understand, and Richard Hope's half-century old translation is not for the faint of heart. Part of the problem, however, is not the (admitted) depth of Aristotle's thought, but the fact that he was thinking in an ancient language, an issue that Hope confronts, and, through his presentation, largely overcomes. The book looks cluttered, but a little use shows how functional it is.<br /><br />Hope's translation has an elaborate apparatus making clear how Aristotle's own choice of words underlies his English version. It shows, without argumentative commentary, how what in our language are discrete concepts fall together quite naturally in the Greek text. The same cross-references show that some ideas we would class together are kept apart in Greek, so Aristotle is not being obtuse in failing to notice how they fit.<br /><br />For those of us with an interest in philosophy or classical antiquity whose Greek ranges between non-existent and minimal, the results can be enlightening.<br /><br />Aristotle, it must be remembered, did not have at his disposal the kind of technical language devised over a couple of thousand years by thinkers working through Plato and, well, Aristotle's \\"Metaphysics\\". He used the Greek language of his time, expressing himself through the relationships between words in ordinary use. Also, he did not have to worry about whether foreigners -- the barbarians, after all -- would be able to make sense of his statements. Aristotle probably would have been horrified, as well as astonished, to learn that some his important advocates and interpreters would know him only through Arabic or Latin versions.<br /><br />I have used the Hope translation for about a quarter of a century, often checking translations of excerpts in other works against it. I have not always come away with a greater understanding, but I have often found something I was missing by reading it either in \\"plain English\\" or technical jargon, and sometimes decided on his evidence that Aristotle's meaning was being misconstrued.<br /><br />I feel that this version will be of use to anyone with a serious interest in this branch of philosophy, or the history of thought. And, except as assigned reading, how many others are likely to look at it? Unless, of course, one has already mastered classical Greek, and has the time and patience to work out Aristotle's use of language directly.<br /><br />For those looking for a somewhat less intimidating-looking introduction, Hugh Lawson-Tancred's translation in Penguin Classics is highly regarded, and probably as readable as an accurate translation of the work is likely to get; and it has an extra half-century of Aristotelian studies behind it. The old Ross translation (the \\"Oxford Aristotle\\"), used through most of the twentieth century in various revisions, has admirers, although I personally found it the most difficult of the three to read at any great length.<br /><br />Finally, for those interested in history-of-philosophy problems beyond Aristotle himself,there is A.E. Taylor's old (1906)  \\"Aristotle on His Predecessors,\\" which was in print as recently as the early 1990s. It deals with the how Aristotle treats earlier philosophers in the first two books of \\"Metaphysics.\\" This is a major problem, since his account is a main source of information on them, but seems to have been meant by Aristotle to set up the terms of his own argument, and not as an investigation of what they had really meant.<br /><br />Of course, that is how philosophers and theologians have used Aristotle himself for centuries...<br /><br />(Reposted from my \\"anonymous\\" review of June 15, 2003.)	2005-01-21
US	30081986	R1MN8SP1E18DU9	0460872974	666949112	Mabinogion (Everyman's Library)	Books	5	123	124	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Beautiful and Puzzling Tales	The publishing history of this edition, and its relationship to other translations of what is commonly known as \\"The Mabinogion,\\" is a little complicated, and I think that is worth clearing up, although it may be a little tedious. However, my explanation of it should serve as \\"buyer's guide\\" if you are hesitating over exactly what to order.<br /><br />In 1948 the Golden Cockerel Press issued an \\"edition-de-luxe\\" of translations from Medieval Welsh prose tales, made by Gwyn Jones and Thomas Jones, under the title of \\"The Mabinogion.\\" This was the direct ancestor of the present Everyman volume. The translators, besides sharing a common Welsh name, were both distinguished academics: Thomas Jones was Professor of Welsh at Aberystwyth, and Gwyn Jones was Professor of English at Aberystwyth and Cardiff.<br /><br />This title of the book was, as the translators pointed out, an erroneous form, a mere scribal error turned into a comprehensive title for stories with quite diverse histories. It was established in the public mind in the nineteenth century by Lady Charlotte Guest, who issued the first complete English translation of the stories, with Welsh texts, published in seven volumes, 1838-1845. The English text and notes of the shorter 1848 edition of her version had been included in the \\"Everyman's Library\\" series since 1906. This fat (432 pages) little volume furthered its position with the literary public interested in Welsh matters, general Celtic literature, or Arthurian stories, despite enormous advances in Welsh studies in the intervening century before the Jones and Jones translation. (I have separately reviewed some of its recent editions, with more on the translator's remarkable life.)<br /><br />A more accurate translation by T.P. Ellis and J. Lloyd, \\"The Mabinogion: A New Translation,\\" had been published by Oxford University Press in 1929, and seems to have made little impact. (One wonders: did the Depression play a role?) It had some useful annotations, and Ihave often wondered why it has never been reprinted, while Guest has gone into a variety of fuller or shorter versions (including the stories-only Dover Thrift edition, and one, apparently with the notes, illustrated by Alan Lee) of her bowdlerized and otherwise truncated rendering. Ellis and Lloyd continued to use Guest's title, and omitted one story, \\"Taliesin,\\" a practice which Jones and Jones followed with no clear explanation. (I will offer one below.)<br /><br />Otherwise, the narrative contents of all three of these translations are the same. They contain stories in four categories. (Note that preferred spellings of proper names vary, and I have not tried to be fully consistent.)<br /><br />First, \\"The Four Branches of the Mabinogi,\\" from which the collective title was derived, consisting of \\"Pwyll, Prince of Dyved,\\" Branwen Daughter of Llyr,\\" \\"Manawydan Son of Llyr,\\" and \\"Math Son of Mathonwy.\\" These begin with a story about the conception and birth of Pwyll's son, Pryderi, whose death is one of the early events in the \\"Fourth Branch,\\" and concern a variety of heroes, and what are clearly rationalized gods. (Evangeline Walton turned each of the \\"Four Branches\\" into a novel; and other writers have done versions of one or another of them.)<br /><br />Second, there are two \\"native tales,\\" \\"The Dream of Maxen Wledig\\" and \\"The Story of Lludd and Llevelys,\\" about Roman (\\"historical\\") and pre-Roman (\\"mythical\\") Britain as imagined by the medieval Welsh. The 'Lludd\\" text, as we have it, actually belongs to the \\"Chronicle\\" tradition launched by Geoffrey of Monmouth's supposed translation from an \\"ancient British book.\\" (Which, if any part of it ever had any existence, was NOT the \\"Mabinogion.\\") \\"Maxen\\" seems to reflect an even more garbled version of a story known to Geoffrey, compounding several real people.<br /><br />Third are two Arthurian stories in native Welsh mode. \\"Culhwch and Olwen,\\" is an elaborate quest, dragging in, at least by name, most of the gods and heroes traceable in Welsh material, and some of their Irish cousins into the bargain, mostly as part of Arthur's court. \\"The Dream of Rhonabwy\\" is a visionary encounter with Arthur and his warriors (and anything else I could say would probably be controversial); a fascinating text, which almost boasts of its authentically dreamlike obscurity.<br /><br />Fourth are three \\"Romances,\\" \\"Owain\\" (otherwise known as \\"The Lady of the Fountain\\"), \\"Peredur son of Evrawc,\\" and \\"Gereint the Son of Erbin,\\" the first and last of which are clearly versions of Chretien de Troyes' Old French Arthurian Romances, \\"Yvain\\" and \\"Erec,\\" while the second is related in a more complex manner to his unfinished and problematic \\"Perceval le Gallois.\\" These seem to illustrate Celtic materials going out into wider European society, and then flowing back into Wales to enrich (and confuse) the native heroic and mythic tradition with ideas of chivalry.<br /><br />The story missing from these two later translations, as well as a third version from 1976, was published by Charlotte Guest as \\"The Tale of Taliesin,\\" although it is also found in some manuscripts as two separate tales. Although attested rather late, there are Irish parallels, and its tradition would seem to belong very much with the \\"native tales\\" like the \\"Four Branches of the Mabinogi\\" and \\"Culhwch.\\" There seems to have been a real Taliesin, an early medieval poet, to whom much later poems were also attributed, but this story-complex has more to do with the myths about the nature of poetry. (It is also behind Thomas Love Peacock's comic novel, \\"The Misfortunes of Elphin,\\" and quite a bit of modern fantasy literature.)<br /><br />Fortunately for those of us who do not read medieval Welsh, Everyman's Library retired the lovely, but unreliable (and textually dubious) Guest translation, replacing it with Jones and Jones in 1949 (J.M. Dent and Sons, Ltd., London, and E.P. Dutton & Co., Inc., New York). This was an inexpensive and readily-available edition, which included a set of textual notes. Confusingly, it kept the old series number (97), which can lead to problems when ordering used copies. It was frequently reprinted, sometimes with emendations including a reissue in 1974 with Supplementary Textual Notes. This preserved the old pagination, which was frequently cited in discussions of the stories, but made it necessary to check the Supplement to be sure of the translators' most recent conclusions. It appeared with more revisions, additions, and a welcome Index of Proper Names in 1989. There were paperback editions (No. 1097) with at least two different covers, one lovely, one, to my mind, merely  garish.<br /><br />Finally, in 1993, with Dent now part of the Orion Publishing Group, and Charles E. Tuttle as the American publisher, it was reset for the Everyman Paperback Classics, with the changes to the translation smoothly incorporated, and the Textual and Supplementary Textual Notes in what seem to be their final forms. Gwyn Jones was still alive to work on these revisions, now with the collaboration of his wife, Mair Jones. The new pagination makes it harder to locate older references to passages; I have held on to my copies of older printings for this reason. Why go flipping through pages when I can look up the reference directly, and then find the corresponding section in a few seconds?<br /><br />There is also a hardcover edition with a Preface by John Updike, published under the Borzoi imprint in 2001 (not seen). However, as the 1993 / 2001 text is the translator's final, preferred, revision, it is important to know that there is a difference -- especially if you are ordering it used. The 1974 text still had, besides the 44-page introduction, 283 pages. The 1993 edition, and its reprintings, are in a slightly larger format, and have a 32-page introduction, and 240 pages of main text.<br /><br />Jones-and-Jones is in almost every way superior to the Guest translation, and is readily available; the lack of the \\"Taliesin\\" material, and of comparable, but modern, annotations, are its only failings. It has two modern competitors. One is the Penguin Classics \\"Mabinogion,\\" translated by Jeffrey Gantz. The English of this translation is more modern, and some prefer it. I find Gantz's decisions on spelling some of the Welsh names rather strange; and some students of Welsh think that some of them are hard to justify. Of more importance to most readers will be his decision to give many of the names, particularly in the long lists of champions, their wives, dogs, horses, and swords, in \\"Culhwch,\\" in the original Welsh. That sounds normal enough, but they are often intended to be understood as nicknames, whose meaning should be transparent, not meaningless, and some are even funny (\\"Big-bone, daughter of Strength\\"). Gantz consistently translates them in footnotes, which is highly distracting. In many cases, putting the Welsh text there for those who need it would have kept the main text easier reading, and looking less like the \\"begats\\" in \\"Genesis\\" and \\"Numbers.\\".<br /><br />The other alternative -- which I would suggest getting as a supplement to either, if not, indeed, as a first choice -- is Patrick K. Ford's \\"The Mabinogi and Other Medieval Welsh Tales.\\" It drops the French-influence Romances, the enigmatic \\"Rhonabwy,\\" and \\"The Dream of Maxen,\\" but gives a clear and vigorous rendering of the Welsh material, with an excellent introduction and notes. Ford not only did away with the persistent \\"Mabinogion\\" mistake in the title, he also included \\"Taliesin,\\" based on the text he had re-edited from manuscripts, and restored to its two-story version, as \\"The Tale of Gwion Bach\\" and \\"The Tale of Taliesin.\\"<br /><br />It seems that Ellis and Lloyd and Jones and Jones, knew that Charlotte Guest's text for the story (with poems) had passed through the hands of the notorious Iolo Morganwg. He was a pioneering scholar who didn't hesitate to *invent* the evidence to support his theories, and they had preferred not to plunge into that thicket. Nor had anyone else. Unfortunately, the Guest version had been worked over by Robert Graves for his brilliant, and absurd, \\"The White Goddess,\\" and a reliable version for non-Celticists was more than overdue. Ford's text edition was of value for another reason; there are close parallels between the stories of Gwion and the boyhood of the Irish hero Fionn (Finn McCool), investigation of which certainly needed a proper edition of the Welsh version to work from.<br /><br />As an added bonus, Ford included as an appendix a translation of the notoriously difficult \\"Cad Goddeu,\\" or \\"Battle of the Trees,\\" also found in Guest's notes. It too had been given a splendid, and absurd, interpretation in terms of the Irish Ogham script by Robert Graves, who demonstrated his profound lack of knowledge of Welsh, and equally deep understanding of Irish. (He actually \\"improved\\" and re-ordered the translation he was using, without reference to the original....) Ford doesn't claim to understand its \\"real meaning,\\" if any, only what it actually says, and it is very nice to have it. (By the way, \\"The Battle of the Trees\\" seems likely to have been in Tolkien's mind, along with Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, when writing of the Siege of Orthanc.)<br /><br />There is a growing secondary literature about the \\"Mabinogion\\" stories, ranging from the excellent but technical, to the trivial, to the seriously erroneous (Graves is not alone!). Gwyn Jones himself contributed an excellent, and readable, analysis of \\"Culhwch and Olwen,\\" in his book \\"Kings, Beasts, and Heroes\\" (1972), where it joins \\"Beowulf\\" and \\"Hrolf Kraki's Saga\\" (Jones having also translated the latter).	2005-01-21

The book is aimed at readers already familiar with studies of Jewish mystical and magical texts of late antiquity and the early middle ages, and their non-Jewish (pagan, Gnostic, and Christian) counterparts. Lesses provides excellent bibliographic guides and useful summaries of previous scholarship, but I suspect that a reader not already familiar with both post-Biblical Judaism in general and at least some studies of the mystical and magical fringes of Rabbinic Judaism in particular will be baffled.     Which is to say that the book is aimed at serious scholars, and those willing to read serious scholarship, even if they are not equipped to contribute to it themselves. For these, and for those willing to familiarize themselves with the basic literature, the book should be worth their time and effort. Lesses considers such issues as asceticism and ritual purity from points of view not often treated in discussions of Rabbinic thought, namely, their role as sources of power and access to knowledge.     The practices Lesses describes and analyses may seem surprising to many readers. They do not fit well into some of the standard models of Jewish history. The emergence of an elite based on mastery of knowledge, rather than inherited status and the performance of public rituals was, from our perspective, a democratization. This is an attractive simplification. The basic Rabbinic legal code, \\"The Mishnah,\\" was originally supposed to be transmitted in oral form alone. The debates over its rulings, which allowed the development of a body of learning ultimately embodied in the Talmud (actually, two Talmuds), was also supposed to be purely oral, which meant learning by rote from living teachers.     All were eventually committed to writing, and made the basis of further written commentaries and codes. Even after printing made texts more readily available, however, the process of learning this material was (and is) difficult. In the earliest stages, those without the economic resources to spend years in study, and those students who found the memorization of recited traditions an insurmountable obstacle, must surely have been anything but happy with the situation. Social standing, not to mention intimacy with God, seemed to be just out of reach.     One way out for those so frustrated was the pursuit of knowledge through other means, including ritual practices. Goals ranged from acquiring angelic aid in memorization, to actual inspiration by the \\"Prince of Torah\\" -- knowing the answers without the bother of studying. (I suspect that rituals for the former purpose may sometimes have seemed to work; the intense concentration required by these rituals must have been good training in themselves, and their performance a builder of confidence.)     These forms of scholarly \\"magic\\" merge, through common practices and forms, with other, more secular pursuits of other goals, whose lack of legitimacy was usually more obvious. With the passage of time, these traditions, probably always marginal, passed almost completely out of the sight of Jewish scholarship. Their recovery, from medieval manuscript collections of esoteric lore, and from discarded documents accidentally preserved in the Cairo Genizah, was one of the more remarkable episodes of twentieth century scholarship, and is still continuing.    The Genizah, by the way, is the \\"attic\\" in which un-needed or unwanted documents written in the sacred Hebrew letters were stored, until they turned to dust of sheer age. The equally reverent European Jewish practice was to bury them like human remains, so the Great Synagogue of Old Cairo became a repository of Jewish texts, and texts merely written by Jews, of enormous historical and literary value.    This illustrates a problem. If you aren't already familiar with the term, you will certainly need an introduction to the Jewish mystical literature, and to several allied subjects. The Listmania of \\"Merkabah and Hekhalot Mysticism: in English,\\" currently included as a link on this page, has excellent suggestions. However, I would recommend few if any of them for a complete beginner in Jewish studies, not already reasonably at home in at least the main personalities and events of the Second Temple and Talmudic periods.    Not that all of it is terribly difficult (although some of it is), but because it is still a fairly specialized area of study, and a good general education will be of only limited help. As a very basic, but sound, introduction, I would suggest \\"Back to the Sources: Reading the Classic Jewish Texts,\\" edited by Barry W. Holtz.

US	30081986	RP0WYZUNG50ZN	0226044475	185543641	1: The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation: Including the Demotic Spells: Texts (Volume 1)	Books	5	94	102	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Magic and Syncretic Religion	According to the introduction to this volume, among other competent sources, one of the more interesting shocks to the delicate sensibilities of nineteenth-century classical scholars was delivered by papyri from Greco-Roman Egypt. The serene and rational &#34;classical&#34; Greeks of their (mainly German) imaginations turned out to be human beings with messy fears, desires, hatreds, and jealousies, and a willingness to turn to magic (ugh!) to obtain their ends. There they were, in Greek, actual &#34;magical papyri&#34; -- spell books, that is, not so much documents purporting to be potent agents in themselves, in the old Egyptian manner of ritually empowered images and paintings.  A common reaction: Let's keep it a secret!  It didn't work. A younger generation of scholars (also mainly, but not entirely, German) began mining the texts for information on daily life (astrological papyri proved more helpful) and religion (more successfully) in late antiquity. Texts scattered in museums and published, if at all, in a variety of journals, had to be assembled and properly edited. Some early efforts were exemplary, some problematic (and some both). It sometimes seemed as if a curse had been laid on the enterprise. Early deaths, the First World War, and economic chaos delayed the publication of a carefully edited volume of collected papyri (Greek passages only). The second volume survived World War II only in proof copies. Meanwhile, more papyri turned up, and the project had to be re-done.  One of the more fortunate results of this delay is the present volume, a careful translation of the Greek papyri containing magic spells, along with the Demotic (late Egyptian in a native &#34;shorthand&#34;) and Coptic (late Egyptian in a mostly Greek-derived script) passages in the same manuscripts. A team of scholars worked on the translations, which come with concise introductions and notes. It is based on the arrangement in the earlier text editions (although, frustratingly, it doesnot come with page-references to the first edition, used in over half a century of scholarly literature).  A second volume, including fuller references, and, above all, indexes, was announced, but so far does not seem to have appeared. This is frustrating, given the number of topics, names, and materials mentioned in just the larger manuscript collections.  [Addendum, May 19, 2017: I must have forgotten I had mentioned this planned second volume in my review. A couple of years ago I found an on-line admission that the project had been cancelled, and I should have noted that here at the time, especially since I still had the reference.....]  As for the work at hand, it is fascinating, if inherently frustrating. We have parts of a library of someone who may have been a working magician, with the habits of a scholar, and actual charms and amulets for a less discriminating clientele. There are instructions on how to pull off party tricks, win (or torment) a lover, or influence important people, as well as protect yourself from the spells of others.  Greek gods mingle with Egyptian deities older than the Pyramids, and Mesopotamian (even Sumerian) Powers make brief appearances. Garbled bits of Jewish and Christian lore are sprinkled throughout. The extent to which any of this represents a real synthesis of religious beliefs (syncretism), or is an unthinking compilation of whatever might give access to power, is a question long debated. I suspect that every instance needs a separate answer, and in most cases we will never have one.  At least four fairly large groups of readers should find the book invaluable.  Those interested in Egypt will welcome a mass of post-Pharaonic material, a lot of it with good parallels from earlier centuries. This has a large and growing bibliography. With some reservations, I would suggest Bob Brier's &#34;Ancient Egyptian Magic&#34; as a place to start, with the bibliography in Betz for additional titles.  For the really serious, David Frankfurter's &#34;Religion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance&#34; (1998) will be rewarding, but not as a start. It is available in paperback from Princeton University Press in the MYTHOS series, as is a revised version of Garth Fowden's &#34;The Egyptian Hermes: An Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind&#34; (1993; originally 1986), another valuable work intended for relatively advanced students.  Those interested in the gods of Greece will find here much evidence of how they were viewed in popular (rather than elite) culture, and what happened to them when carried abroad by their worshippers. As supplements on these areas, I suggest two far-ranging surveys, Fritz Graf's &#34;Magic in the Ancient World&#34; and Matthew W. Dickie's &#34;Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World.&#34; I have some methodological concerns with both, and with what I regard as some serious errors by Dickie (particularly regarding Mesopotamian and Jewish topics), but both display immense learning and intelligence. Graf is easier, and also has some excellent discussions of the Egyptian material to add to Brier, with more bibliography. With a narrower range, but extremely important, is Christopher A. Faraone's &#34;Ancient Greek Love Magic,&#34;  which deals directly with a whole class of texts translated in Betz et al., and places them in a long cultural context.  [Addendum, May 19, 2017: There is a new (2016) book on the hymns to the Greek deities included in these manuscripts: Ljuba Merlina Bortolani's &#34;Magical Hymns from Roman Egypt: A Study of Greek and Egyptian Traditions of Divinity,&#34; which has been reviewed on the on-line (and free) &#34;Bryn Mawr Classical Review&#34; (review 2017.5.30; html version available on the BMCR blog).]  Thirdly, students of early Jewish mysticism will at last get ready access to texts which have been used to date &#34;Merkabah&#34; and &#34;Hekhalot&#34; texts (concerning heavenly ascents and visions of the Divine Throne), which survive only in medieval manuscripts. There is a remarkable overlap of &#34;secret names&#34; of God and angels, and some shared ideas of the cosmos, and how to obtain visionary knowledge. The bibliography for this is large, and I have yet to find a good introductory volume; for now, see my review of Rebecca Macy Lesses's &#34;Ritual Practices to Gain Power: Angels, Incantations, and Revelation in Early Jewish Mysticism.&#34;&#34;  [Long Addendum, May 19, 2017: A good, if expensive, translation of most of the Merkabah and Hekhalot literature is available: James R. Davila's &#34;Hekhalot Literature in Translation: Major Texts of Merkabah Mysticism&#34; (Brill, 2013). It omits some mainly exegetical (non-mystical) works on the theme of the Chariot in Ezekiel, and the so-called &#34;Third Book of Enoch,&#34; or &#34;Hebrew Enoch,&#34; properly known as the Sefer Hekhalot, which lacks the mystical hymns, but has many prose descriptions of the heavens, and information on the adventures of various mystical rabbis (who in fact may have had nothing to do with the matter).  [A recent, very good, and thoroughly annotated translation of &#34;Third Enoch&#34; by P. Alexander is available in R. H. Charlesworth, ed., &#34;The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha,&#34; Volume 1 (1983). There is also a translation by A. Nyland, available in Kindle in &#34;The Complete Books of Enoch.&#34;  Unfortunately, this attractive version lacks critical notes giving, among other things, the various versions of the &#34;Sacred Names&#34; which are of considerable interest in relation to the magical texts. Other translations are more--or-less modernized versions of an early twentieth-century version which is quite unreliable, both as an edition of the text and as a translation of the manuscript used.)  [The name &#34;Third Enoch&#34; was given to to the book in order to distinguish it from the so-called &#34;First Book of Enoch,&#34; which exists in a substantially complete Ethiopic text, and, as fragments,in other languages, and from the &#34;Second Book of Enoch,&#34; which was known only in Old Church Slavonic, until fragments recently turned up in Coptic.]  Finally, the late pagan spells fade off into the Coptic literature of early Christian Egypt, although &#34;Christian Magic&#34; usually has received separate treatments, and is only incidentally represented in this collection. A good place to start (and containing some minor overlaps) is &#34;Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power&#34; (1994), translations with commentary, edited by Marvin W. Meyer and Richard Smith. The supposed limits of official Christianity, superficially Christianized paganism, fringe Christianity, and Gnosticism, are crossed and recrossed in the texts presented. This too is available, slightly revised, in the Princeton MYTHOS series of trade paperbacks (1999).  As for practicing magicians -- everyone should know that you can't just use someone else's book of spells, you need authorization and personal instruction! And a copy made personally from a manuscript....  (Reposted from my &#34;anonymous&#34; review, originally posted September  9, 2003 )	2005-01-20
US	30081986	R23E36CSJOESEE	0140440852	801058727	The Voyage of Argo: The Argonautica (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	52	53	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Jason the Almost-Hero	Homer mentioned the voyage of the Argo as a well-known story, and bits and pieces appear in surviving Greek lyrics and dramas of the Classical period. Jason's later life with Medea is a well-known subject of tragedy. Our oldest comprehensive account of the journey, however, comes from Hellenistic times, in a work by Apollonius, at one time associated with the Library of Alexandria, commonly known as &#34;of Rhodes,&#34; supposedly from his favorable reception by the islanders.  The Jason of this version, from the third century BC, is a good deal less than an Homeric hero, overshadowed both by his companions (and who would not seem inadequate beside Hercules?) and by the goddesses who intervene on his behalf. He is not unattractive -- indeed, some may find him more appealing than the all-competent heroes of other epics. He has emotions one can recognize, including fear and despair. Still, one can see him later being both callous enough and stupid enough to dump the witch-princess of Colchis for a &#34;better&#34; (socially acceptable and politically advantageous) marriage in Greece.  That was the tragic plot which Apollonius avoids, but it was well-known in his day, and which has survived to our own in Euripides' version. He certainly had it in mind, and knew that those who read, or more likely heard the reading of, his epic, would as well. (Seneca's Latin tragedy &#34;Medea,&#34; and Ovid's treatment of the character, of great importance in later European views of the story, were still in the future.)  This prose translation, first published in 1959 and reissued with some revisions and new apparatus in 1971, was the first new English version since 1912 (the Loeb Classical Library bilingual edition), and remained the only popular version for several decades. It has since been joined by others, in verse as well as prose. They represent more recent scholarship in both the Greek text and critical views of the poet and the epic. Two of them, at least, are considerably more ambitious as works of art. Barbara Hughes Fowler's &#34;Hellenistic Poetry: An Anthology&#34; not only contains the complete epic, but much of its cultural context. The hardcover edition of Peter Green's &#34;The Argonautika: The Story of Jason and the Quest for the Golden Fleece&#34; contained extensive commentary (abridged in the paperback edition). These are both in verse. There is also a prose version by Richard L. Hunter, &#34;Jason and the Golden Fleece,&#34; published in the Oxford World's Classics.  Can the good old Penguin Classics standby still compete?  For those looking for high poetry, or for elaborate notes, or sophisticated critical positions, probably not. But, despite the comments of at least one competitor, Rieu's treatment is not without its merits. Although Rieu's English is now a little antiquated, it remains readable. His English version is helped as well as hindered by a tendency to reduce the relatively ornate style of a learned Alexandrian poet to something more approachable to an *intelligent* school-boy (&#34;school-boy&#34; being the critic's reproach). It is still a good place to begin, and for those who are simply curious about Jason's adventures, it may be the best place. Once convinced of its charms, the reader may be encouraged to try a more poetic version, and discover that Apollonius was more than an engaging storyteller with a modern taste for the anti-heroic.  Of course, I tend to favor a book that enchanted me when I read it in 1968.  (Reposted from my &#34;anonymous&#34; review of June 27, 2003.)  [October 2015 Note that, as of October 2014, Rieu’s old prose translation of this work has been supplemented (but not, according to Amazon, replaced) in the Penguin Classics by a new verse translation, as “Jason and the Argonauts” by Apollonius of Rhodes, translated by Aaron Poochigian, and edited with an Introduction by Benjamin Acosta-Hughes (not seen).]	2005-01-20
US	30081986	R2S79Z5L0310ON	0152787100	723341139	Star Gate	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on:  "Quantum Anthropology"	&#34;Star Gate&#34; is a fairly early example of Andre Norton's science fiction (1958), and its brevity shows the demands of the &#34;juvenile&#34; label under which it was originally published. The use of what was originally a pseudonym of Alice Mary Norton was another example of such demands; a publisher wanted a &#34;masculine&#34; name for adventure stories. The author obliged, but later legally changed her name; and always omitted the diacritical mark that indicated that &#34;Andre&#34; was French, and masculine.  This limit on length did nothing to limit the author's imagination, however, and the book is crammed with themes which another writer might have scattered among a dozen books. Whatever the original Harcourt Brace hardcover jacket said, the Ace, and, later, Ballantine (Del Rey), paperback editions were both targeted as much at adults as children and teenagers. A reader of any age can probably find things to enjoy over the course of several readings. I must have read it for the first time in the early 1960s, and have returned to it with pleasure at intervals of ten or fifteen years.  In the midst of a crackling good adventure story, the narrative touches on issues ranging from &#34;benign&#34; colonialism (&#34;The White Man's Burden&#34;) to racist imperialism to inter-species (read: inter-racial) sex, to religion, all distanced from 1950s censorship by the strange planet Gorth and alternate timelines. As a bonus, the naive hero sometimes compares his own adventures to those in old songs -- for which we often can fill in the cliches of pulp fiction, and juvenile novels likely to have been found on the same shelf as the original hardcover.  The choice of a young and ignorant point of view character allows Norton to explain some things to the reader through answers to the hero, such as the brief presentation of a basic quantum mechanics theory of the equal reality of alternate states. Meanwhile, the reader is more subtly informed about a new and alien society through the same character's expectations about the world. This may seem a common enough technical device, but Norton was using it with precision when many adult as well as juvenile titles tended to belabor things. Not only are two versions of Gorth explored through these two devices, but we learn about the &#34;Star Lords&#34; from Earth mainly through indirection and arguments. (One remembers, in contrast, Heinlein tossing in a Margaret Mead imitation to  give an anthropology lecture in &#34;Citizen of the Galaxy&#34;.)  Although Norton has not returned to the Gorth setting (in any of its time lines), she did introduce alternate-world versions of other planets, most notably in &#34;Android at Arms&#34; (with a similarly rich mix of themes) and &#34;Perilous Dreams.&#34; What appear to be mutually exclusive alternate time-lines are launched in some of the later volumes of the (original) &#34;Time Traders&#34; series. Some readers also enjoy the alternate Earths of the two &#34;Crosstime&#34; books, although I personally consider these &#34;minor Norton&#34;.  For some reason, Norton titles seem to be picked up for movies and television, but only titles: Neither &#34;Beastmaster&#34; nor &#34;Stargate&#34; had anything much to do with the Norton novels of the same name, although the former made a few glances in the direction of her story, and, if one squints one can see the idea of &#34;Gods from the Stars&#34; in the latter. &#34;Stargate SG-1&#34; has made a few uses of alternate worlds, but any Norton influence on that seems unlikely.

US	30081986	R29JADHAPQZXLH	0140443614	635323215	Parzival (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	105	114	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Quirky Genius, An Engaging Oddity	There seem to be currently available three complete English translations of Wolfram von Eschenbach's Middle High German &#34;Parzival,&#34; an early, and slightly eccentric, version of the Grail Quest. Wolfram, both a knight and a (slightly eccentric) poet from thirteenth-century southern Germany, is the author of this long Arthurian romance, of a long Carolingian epic, &#34;Willehalm,&#34; and some shorter works. His complaints about rival poets, and their replies to him, have turned out to be clues to relative dating of their works. On this and external evidence, Wolfram's poetic career has been dated between about 1195 and 1225; with the almost 25,000 lines of &#34;Parzival&#34; being composed between about 1200 and 1210.<br /><br />[Additional Note, March 2015; Jessie L. Weston's nineteenth-century verse translation, &#34;Parzival: A Knightly Epic,&#34; is another alternative, although I hesitate to recommend it.  Nabu Press has issued it in paperback, as well as out-of-copyright German text editions and modern German translations. Many of these, and others, can be also be found at archive.org (the Library of Congress website), although the two volumes of Weston's translation must be searched for as &#34;Parzival,&#34; and not under the translator's name. (Archive.org also makes available the 1891 fifth edition of Karl Lachmann's enduring edition of Wolfram's works; Edwards, and, I think, the other modern translators, mainly used the 1926 sixth edition.) There are also Project Gutenberg editions of a number of Weston's works, including &#34;Parzival,&#34; some of them available in Kindle format, among other versions. In fact there are three Kindle editions of her &#34;Parzival&#34; currently (March 2015) available; one observing the original two-volume hardcover arrangement in its now digital format, for which I can't see any necessity.]<br /><br />The most recent translation, Cyril Edwards'  &#34;Parzival: With Titurel and the Love Lyrics,&#34; I have not yet seen. It includes a fragmentary related work, and Wolfram's contributions to the &#34;Minnesaenger&#34; (love poetry) tradition, which makes it attractive. The price of the hardcover is against starting with it! A more reasonably-priced paperback, aimed at the student market, would be a winner, if the translation is good. [Additional Note: this translation is now (from 2008) available in a shorter format as &#34;Parzival and Titurel&#34; in the Oxford World's Classics series; I have reviewed it separately, based on the Kindle edition. In brief Edwards' translation may be more faithful to Wolfram's style, but some readers find it difficult going.]<br /><br />Of the other two, both rendered in prose, the older is &#34;Parzival: A Romance of the Middle Ages&#34; (usually cited without the subtitle, in my experience), translated by Helen M. Mustard and Charles E. Passage, and published by Vintage Books (Random House), in 1961. With an Introduction, Additional Notes, an Index of Persons, and a Genealogical Table, I found it an attractive entrance to Wolfram-studies, and Middle High German literature beyond the &#34;Nibelungenlied.&#34; The language of the translation is relatively colloquial, and has been criticized as both inexact in its use of hunting and heraldic terms, and perhaps too American. A more valid criticism, in my opinion, pointed out that a good deal of the introduction is spent discussing discarded theories floated by Jessie L. Weston (of &#34;From Ritual to Romance&#34;) in connection with her verse translation at the end of the nineteenth century. Since Weston's version was the one most likely to be familiar to Mustard and Passage's original readers, this made a certain amount of sense, but they might have mentioned that her views were no longer taken very seriously. The cover art is a medieval &#34;portrait&#34; of the armored Wolfram, anonymous under his knightly helmet.<br /><br />Almost twenty years later, A.T. Hatto (on whose review of the Vintage translation I have been drawing) produced his own version, in the Penguin Classics (1980); the cover art uses manuscript illuminations of scenes from the poem. Like Hatto's &#34;Nibelungenlied&#34; translation, it is in prose, and has, instead of an extended discussion before reading, an appended &#34;Introduction to a Second Reading,&#34; along with a Glossary of Personal Names, and a List of Works in English for Further Reading. The critical discussion is excellent, and postponing it until a reader has a chance to form an opinion is an interesting idea. At least the student won't be quite so tempted to substitute reading the editorial commentary for a reading of the text, if one has to look for it.<br /><br />Hatto's English is a bit obviously British; and some of his &#34;corrected&#34; readings are actually more difficult to follow, unless you are already familiar with the technical languages of hunting and blazonry. Otherwise, for example, &#34; a pair&#34; of birds is going to be clearer than &#34;a brace&#34; of them. This was not the case with Hatto's translation of the &#34;Tristan&#34; of Wolfram's rival, Gottfried von Strassburg (also from Penguin). The &#34;Tristan&#34; tradition makes a great point of how its hero uses the correct -- meaning fashionable -- hunting language, and Hatto was there, obviously, correct to reproduce the impression of mastery of an esoteric art. Either version is enjoyable, although Hatto (obviously) seems a bit more concerned with precision, and Mustard and Passage a little more with immediate appeal to readers.<br /><br />Wolfram himself was translating, in his own fashion, Chretien de Troyes' unfinished &#34;Perceval, or, The Story of the Grail&#34; -- although he himself claims to have an additional source, the mysterious &#34;Kyot,&#34; who had a better, truer, version. Since Chretien himself claimed to have been working from a source provided by a patron, this has at times sent scholars searching in many directions. Jessie Weston's theory, emphasizing Wolfram's references to Anjou and the Angevins, whose dynasty of Counts had come to rule England (see Henry II), was as plausible as most, and just as much a blind alley. It looks very much as if Wolfram had some sort of additional material -- there are odd resemblances to &#34;Morien,&#34; an apparent interpolation in the medieval Dutch translation of the Lancelot-Grail romances, for example -- but mostly to have used his imagination quite freely.<br /><br />We have an entire opening section with the hero's father, Gahmuret the Anschevin, having adventures in a vaguely-conceived Near East and North Africa, where he leaves a &#34;pagan&#34; wife and son, the latter, the multi-colored Feirefiz, crossing paths with Wolfram's main hero years later. (It is worth noting that, although Wolfram is a snob, and is fascinated by physical differences between human beings, he is in no sense a racist; color is no bar to aristocracy.) This is followed by Gahmuret's second marriage and death, the birth and upbringing in forest isolation of Parzival himself, his fateful encounter with Arthur's knights, and the splitting of the story to include the exploits of Sir Gawain (recognizable under German renderings, variously handled by translators over the years), and Parzival's first adventure at the Grail Castle, all derived from Chretien's account of Perceval and Gauvain, all retold in Wolfram's quirky style. Then Wolfram returns to what seems to be new material, writing his own conclusion. (Eric Rohmer's film version of &#34;Perceval&#34; is a splendid visualization of Chretien's version, and works almost equally well for parts of Wolfram's retelling, too.)<br /><br />As in other versions, Chretien's very mysterious &#34;graal&#34; is drawn into a Christian conception of the universe. But Wolfram explains it as a sort of magic stone that fell to earth during the War in Heaven, not a relic of the Last Supper. That more explicitly  Christianized version seems to belong to the Old French cycle of &#34;Joseph of Arimathea,&#34; &#34;Merlin&#34; and &#34;Perceval,&#34; attributed to Robert de Boron, and was later picked up and amplified in the &#34;Vulgate Cycle&#34; of Arthurian romances (centering on Lancelot, and introducing Galahad as the Quest hero, alongside Perceval), the version known in English through Malory, and, so far as the Chalice interpretation, also used by Wagner.<br /><br />Wagner plundered Wolfram for names and a certain &#34;German&#34; quality for his Grail opera, &#34;Parsifal,&#34; besides using another version of a story Wolfram alludes to in &#34;Lohengrin,' and the poet's name for a character in &#34;Tannhauser.&#34; Personally, I suggest tossing aside all Wagnerian preconceptions, if any, and allowing Wolfram's real personality to have a chance. Sarcastic (especially about competitors), sentimental (especially about wives and children), full of pride in the knightly caste (a new phenomenon, which its members wanted to be very old), arrogantly announcing that he is completely illiterate in the company of poets who boasted they could read anything ever written, he is both annoying and lovable. A living personality, in fact, appearing in a time used to anonymous authors.<br /><br />For those who find &#34;Parzival&#34; a pleasure, or who would like to try a more military, rather than chivalric, work, there are also translations of his &#34;Willehalm,&#34; based on the Old French *chanson de geste* of William Curt-Nose, or Guillaume l'Orange, one of the heroes of the legends of Charlemagne and his descendants. I am familiar with two, both into prose. One, by Marion E. Gibbs and Sidney M. Johnson, was published by Penguin Classics in 1984, and is currently in print, as &#34;Wolfram von Eschenbach: Willehalm.&#34; Charles E. Passage, one of the co-translators of &#34;Parzival,&#34; had earlier translated it as &#34;The Middle High German Poem of Willehalm by Wolfram von Eschenbach,&#34; published by Frederick Ungar in 1977. Although it is out of print, used copies of the trade paperback edition seem to be available.<br /><br />Curiously, the supposedly illiterate Wolfram seems unusually aware of the idea (if not the facts) of history. The &#34;Pagan&#34; Saracens of his French source are connected by him with the Romans (as descended from the followers of Pompey, rather than of Caesar, and heirs of an old feud), and also with the extra-European characters he had already invented for &#34;Parzival.&#34; He rather neatly brings into the correct sequence his versions of Arthurian and Carolingian Europe.and the Angevins, whose dynasty of Counts had come to rule England (see Henry II), was as plausible as most, and just as much a blind alley.

US	30081986	R13QX5N3IU2S8U	0520047702	55127702	Structure and History in Greek Mythology and Ritual (Sather Classical Lectures)	Books	5	51	56	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Excellent, But Not to Start With	&#34;Structure and History in Greek Mythology and Ritual&#34; is part of a surprisingly long list of books by Walter Burkert, now Professor Emeritus at the University of Zurich, which have appeared in English translation, beginning with &#34;Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism&#34; in 1972. This is unusual in an age of supposedly declining interest in Greek and Latin, particularly since his books, while generally packed with information, also address theoretical issues, and are not always easy to understand. A number of them have been controversial, either for his own ideas, or for his challenges to the accepted wisdom. However, they are usually very interesting. The present book, one of his shorter works, is no exception. And it, too, makes demands on the reader.<br /><br />[Note: Prof. Burkert (b. 1931) passed away in March 2015.]<br /><br />&#34;Structure and History&#34; forms Volume Forty-seven of the Sather Classical Lectures, an invitational series delivered by Visiting Professors at the University of California at Berkeley since early in the twentieth century, and shows every sign of being aimed at professional scholars. Like many of the other contributions to the lecture series (a surprisingly large number of which have found their way into paperback editions over the years), it keeps the really difficult material tucked away in notes, and the primary argument doesn't need technical knowledge to follow. (Evaluating it is another matter.)<br /><br />&#34;Structure and History&#34; picks up issues raised in Burkert's earlier, much longer, &#34;Greek Religion&#34; (in Britain, &#34;Greek Religion: Archaic and Classical&#34;), originally published in 1977, and translated in 1985. That is an engaging book which I found quite convincing, at least while reading it, as was the case with his shorter &#34;Ancient Mystery Cults&#34; (1987, originally the Carl Newell Jackson Lectures for 1982), with which it also has some overlaps.<br /><br />My reaction to Burkert's book on killing as a ritual act, &#34;Homo Necans: The Anthropology of Ancient Greek Sacrificial Ritual and Myth&#34; (1972, translated 1983), was that Burkert got off on the wrong track on several matters. As Ian Morris put it about one of them in &#34;Death-Ritual and Social Structure in Classical Antiquity&#34; (1992), &#34;Burkert's derivation of funerary rituals from hunting and sacrifice ... is ... unnecessarily limiting.&#34; But some of the ideas in &#34;Homo Necans&#34; appear in &#34;Structure and History,&#34; in what I found a more modest and acceptable form.<br /><br />In fact, except for &#34;Lore and Science,&#34; most of his books can be read as parts of a single investigation of ancient Greek religion in its various manifestations. And even &#34;Lore and Science&#34; deals with the Pythagoreans as a religious movement.<br /><br />&#34;Structure and History in Greek Mythology and Ritual&#34; appears to be a short survey, but it is NOT for beginners. If you aren't familiar with at least a couple of roughly college-level surveys, you may find yourself lost. I've been reading the sources (Greek, Latin, and others) in translation) as well as studies, for several decades, and from time to time I found myself reaching for Tripp's &#34;Handbook of Classical Mythology&#34; or Feder's &#34;Handbook of Classical Literature,&#34; just to be sure I was following the argument correctly. Usually I was. Burkert isn't all *that* desperately obscure (at least not in the old, oracular, German manner), but sometimes I needed to have some lesser-known variants or obscure sources identified. Those even more amateur than myself will do well to bear this in mind before trying the book. And it is worth trying.<br /><br />It could be used, I would think, as a mythological companion to Burkert's &#34;Greek Religion,&#34; which deals mainly with sacred places, rituals, and other material and literary evidence, but only incidentally with mythological narratives. But it israther heavily committed to basic issues of interpretive method, and is not aimed at fulfilling that function.<br /><br />The title hearkens back to watchwords of the previous hundred years, including the old Myth-and-Ritual School, following Frazer, and the Structuralists of the middle and late twentieth century, but Burkert has new information -- mostly concrete data from the Ancient Near East -- with which to address the same problems. In place of speculation and anthropology, he has datable texts, presenting myths, and describing or prescribing rituals. He assumes that the reader is already quite familiar with the Greek material, and goes directly to important themes, and the methodological issues they present.<br /><br />Burkert has covered some of the same material, with much else, in several different contexts: &#34;The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age&#34; (1992) and, most recently, in &#34;Babylon, Memphis, Persepolis: Eastern Contexts of Greek Culture&#34; (2004). These return to the problems posed by evidence of older and contemporary civilizations, and their relationship to developments in Greece.<br /><br />The adventurous may also wish to try Burkert's &#34;Creation of the Sacred: Tracks of Biology in Early Religions&#34; (1996), where again I find his work seeming to become too speculative. But it is interesting, quite enough to be worth the effort; and he may be right. He has treated some of the same problems in &#34;Savage Energies: Lessons of Myth and Ritual in Ancient Greece&#34; (1990, translated 2001).is not aimed at fulfilling that function.  The title hearkens back to watchwords of the previous hundred years, including the old Myth-and-Ritual School, following Frazer, and the Structuralists of the middle and late twentieth century, but Burkert has new information -- mostly concrete data from the Ancient Near East -- with which to address the same problems.

Burkert has covered some of the same material, with much else, in several different contexts: &#34;The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age&#34; (1992) and, most recently, in &#34;Babylon, Memphis, Persepolis: Eastern Contexts of Greek Culture&#34; (2004). These return to the problems posed by evidence of older and contemporary civilizations, and their relationship to developments in Greece.  The adventurous may also wish to try Burkert's &#34;Creation of the Sacred: Tracks of Biology in Early Religions&#34; (1996), where again I find his work seeming to become too speculative. But it is interesting, quite enough to be worth the effort; and he may be right. He has treated some of the same problems in &#34;Savage Energies: Lessons of Myth and Ritual in Ancient Greece&#34; (1990, translated 2001).	2005-01-16

Some of these arguments have surfaced in news reports, often garbled, or just without their proper intellectual contexts, and offered as much for shock value as for the information they provide.  A.J. Pollard's new book (he has previously published several learned papers on the subject) is going to be harder to sensationalize, but I found it quite exciting anyway.  A &#34;live issue&#34; in Robin Hood studies has been the social basis of the original Robin Hood literature -- or at least of the earliest surviving pieces, which date from the Fifteenth Century. This is not the Robin Hood of most modern popular literature, the rightful Earl of Huntingdon, or the Anglo-Saxon champion resisting the Normans (these emerged from Elizabethan and Romantic reworkings), but the Yeoman and his companions. Little John and Will Scarlock (or Scarlet), Guy of Gisborne, and some others, are present, but no Maid Marian or Friar Tuck.  There are other differences; the Sheriff's wife is a character with her own part to play, and Little John is himself a clever trickster. The setting is not the age of King Richard Lion-Heart and Prince John, but an indefinable High Middle Ages, under one of the several Kings named Edward. The scene ranges from Sherwood in Nottinghamshire north to Barnesdale in Yorkshire.  The argument has ranged back and forth. Robin was created by and for the gentry. No, Robin represents the English peasant. No, England didn't *have* peasants, in the strict sense, so he couldn't represent them. Well then, he represents the rising Yeoman class. No, Yeoman was an occupational term. Wait a minute, by Parliamentary statute it designated a social status! He is religious, but anti-clerical; what does that mean, set between the Lollards and Henry VIII? And so on.  Pollard has taken a close look at the arguments, and the evidence of external documents. The argument presented here is that the surviving texts reveal stories directed at a whole range of classes and interests, and that their use of &#34;yeoman&#34; reflects genuine changes and ambiguities current in the period. Pollard traces the development of the term, and shows how inconsistent uses were inherent in its history, and involved everything from the Royal Household to the London Guilds to the village community. The rise and fall of the &#34;Forest Law&#34; is traced, and with it attitudes toward Foresters, Poachers, and the limits of authority and socially acceptable resistance.  The &#34;Adam Bell&#34; ballad and the pseudo-Chaucerian &#34;Gamelyn&#34; are both brought into the picture, where they certainly belong, making it clear that the plots and characters of the &#34;Robin Hood&#34; stories (in ballads and plays, and probably other forms which have left less evidence) were not memories of a unique hero, but a familiar set of formulas, with &#34;Robin&#34; as the best-known name. He also acknowledges that the comparatively late &#34;Earl of Huntingdon&#34; version has good medieval parallels in tales of outlawed nobles and rebel barons, like Fulk Fitz-Warin, and &#34;Ranulf Erle of Chester&#34; (who, as should be well known, is actually mentioned alongside Robin as a typical subject of idle stories in one of the early references).  It is not Errol Flynn, or Richard Greene, or even Howard Pyle (although Pyle's prose retelling is often very close to the source texts). But the society of pre-Reformation England is brought to life with telling details, from both official documents and the literature of heroic outlaws. Robin Hood fanciers of various sorts will want to take a close look at Pollard's argument. As for me, I'm planning to re-read it with my copy of Child's &#34;English and Scottish Popular Ballads&#34; open in front of me. (Not the mostup-to-date text edition, but I won't have to return it to the library.)	2005-01-15

Byock's translation of the Old Icelandic &#34;Volsunga Saga&#34; -- a prose version of older stories, some surviving in Old Norse poems, including events going back at least to the fall of the Roman Empire -- is the most readily available English-language version, and in my opinion is one of the best -- arguably, the best, period.<br /><br />&#34;Volsunga Saga,&#34; the story of the ancestors and deeds of Sigurd the Dragon-Slayer, his murder, and the following vengeance, has been translated into English a number of times; a reflection in part of its own qualities as a story, in part of the celebrity of Wagner's &#34;Ring&#34; cycle, portions of which are, rather loosely, based upon it, as well as other Norse and German versions, and Wagner's own notions of what Germanic myths should have been. (The  relations between versions of the tales, which seem to have been popular over a wide area for many centuries, are complex. I have discussed some examples in a review of another translation, as &#34;Volsung Saga.&#34;)<br /><br />The Saga differs from the &#34;Nibelungenlied&#34; in more than details, and in being in  Old Icelandic prose rather than Middle High German verse; the Icelandic narrative is rich in a sense of personal honor offended, and legal precepts followed or ignored, in places where the German account is very much concerned with the outer signs of rank and feudal hierarchy. Both are equally reflective of reality; but different realities.<br /><br />William Morris worked up a fine-sounding English version with the assistance of the Icelandic scholar Eirikr Magnusson, first published in 1870; it had a long-lasting paperback edition from Collier Books, beginning in 1962 (also published in a British edition as a Collier-Mac). That version had a good introduction by Robert W. Gutman, but lacked the corrections supplied by Magnusson, and incorporated in May Morris' edition of her father's &#34;Collected Works&#34; in 1911. Morris and Magnusson had the happy thought of including older versions of the story from the &#34;Poetic Edda' (or &#34;Elder Edda&#34;), not then readily available in English translation; particularly those old poems barely summarized in the prose account, or omitted. Unfortunately, as &#34;The Story of the Volsungs and the Niblungs; With Certain Songs from the Elder Edda,&#34; with or without &#34;Volsunga Saga,&#34; as the main or subtitle, it tends to be confused with Morris' own epic poem, &#34;The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs.&#34;<br /><br />Morris was not happy with Wagner's treatment of the story (or with the way it overshadowed his epic); but his translation has been linked to it in edition after edition. I love this version, and wouldn't give up my copy. But the language of the translation, although often beautiful, is rather alien to modern readers. Between Morris' actual mistakes, improvement in text editions, and advances in Icelandic studies, it hardly meets modern standards of reliability. And Morris' archaizing style in his saga translations suggests that the sagas' language is highly wrought and romantically lush, when, by all accounts, the style is notably sparse, and even severe. (I have discussed the style at greater length in a review of a Kessinger digital edition of the translation, the previously-mentioned &#34;Volsung Saga&#34; edition.)<br /><br />In 1930, the American-Scandinavian Foundation published a new translation by Margaret Schlauch, which instead of Eddic poems included &#34;Ragnar Lodbrok's Saga&#34; and the poem &#34;Krakumal,&#34; which follow &#34;Volsunga&#34; in the unique parchment manuscript, and were clearly designed to be part of the same story. (A practice which should have been followed by others, in my view.) It was simpler in style, although not really idiomatic. This was followed in 1965 by R.G. Finch's edition of the Icelandic text with facing translation, and then by George K. Anderson's translation with other supplementary material in 1982 (which I have examined, but not read with care). There were also translations of excerpts, some very appealing, including those by Jacqueline Simpson in &#34;Beowulf and Its Analogues&#34; (1971). Finally, in 2000, there was another bilingual edition for serious students, edited and translated by Kaaren Grimstad (published in Germany; not seen).<br /><br />Of those older translations that I have seen, I think that Finch's was the most readable, although perhaps a little flat after Morris. There was certain clutter of notes and variant readings on the pages, but the English was clear. Schlauch's should have been easier reading than Morris' version, but slightly eccentric page layout often made it hard to figure out who was speaking to whom at first glance. Unfortunately, the Schlauch, Finch, Anderson, and Grimstad translations all have something else in common: they are out of print.<br /><br />So, for most purposes, is the venerable Morris; there *is* a premium-priced edition available on Amazon.co.uk (which doesn't seem aimed at the curious reader!), and an on-demand text from Kessinger. The various digital editions being offered also may *all* be this well-out-of-copyright translation; the Kessinger e-book edition follows an 1888 printing, with a long-obsolete introduction, for example (and I assume is, with its misprints, identical to their 'hard copy' version).<br /><br />But Jesse L. Byock's &#34;The Saga of the Volsungs: The Norse Epic of Sigurd the Dragon Slayer&#34; is in print. Fortunately, it *is* a very readable translation, with extremely useful notes, and, having compared it to Morris & Magnusson, Schlauch, and Finch, I am inclined to trust Byock's work, as well as enjoy it. I have found it, in fact, the most easy to follow, while Byock's notes seem reflect a concern for precision in language.<br /><br />Originally published by the University of California Press in 1990, it was soon issued in paperback with a cover based on an eleventh-century Swedish rune stone depicting the slaying of the dragon Fafnir (on eye-catching red). It was later picked up in Penguin Classics, with a cover showing a detail of a twelfth-century woodcarving of Sigurd and the dwarf Regin reforging the sword Gram. The Penguin edition of 1999 is a little smaller in format, but the two are otherwise identical. (Years ago I used the wider margins of my 1990 copy for notes, and cross-references to other translations; which proved handy in preparing this review.) The UC Press edition has more recently (2002) been reissued, with a rather nineteenth-century romantic version of Vikings at sea; an attractive cover, but not as relevant to the contents. (Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.ca also offer a 1992 Hisarlik Press edition, which appears to have a migration-age shield on the cover.)<br /><br />The new cover of the UC Press edition also mentions Tolkien and &#34;Lord of the Rings,&#34; along with Wagner (and why did they need to wait for Peter Jackson?). Tolkien's parallels to &#34;Volsunga Saga&#34; are clear, although mingled with other sources, and an abundance of Tolkien's own invention. Tolkien, unlike Wagner, could read the sources in their original forms, but he created anew, instead of purporting to retell. The points of contact range from aspects of &#34;The Silmarillion&#34; (mainly Hurin and Turin, where they are mixed with material from the Finnish &#34;Kalevala,&#34; but also Beren's wolf-form, and a dragon's curse / prophecy) to the (off-stage) reforging of Narsil / Anduril in &#34;Lord of the Rings.&#34; The clearest example is Tolkien's recasting of Sigurd's conversations with Fafnir into the chats with Smaug in &#34;The Hobbit&#34; -- the implicit contrast between Bilbo and Sigurd adds to the comedy for those fortunate enough to know both.

US	30081986	R2OH0DGUX9E7OD	0268002673	297216006	The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages	Books	5	65	65	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Pioneering Effort	This book,\\"The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages,\\" was first published around 1940, in wartime Britain; I have seen conflicting statements on the actual, as against the scheduled, date. It was revised in 1952, in an edition from the Oxford publisher, Blackwell and reprinted by the University of Notre Dame Press (Indiana) in 1964, with a new Preface and some bibliographic updating; which is the date given by Amazon. The title is a little misleading, as I shall explain below.<br /><br />Through the late 1990s, at least, it was being cited at *the* standard work in English; departures from its positions had to be justified, agreements did not. But, with new editions of texts, and new ways of reading them, it is getting old.<br /><br />I first read it in the 1970s, and was glad to find a paperback copy (of the 1978 third Notre Dame printing) some years later. I have been waiting for an equally comprehensive successor to appear, in English. In the meantime, I have found that it remains amazingly useful, amidst an abundance of much more advanced, much more technical, and much more specialized, studies. An example would be Ann W. Astell's \\"The Song of Songs in the Middle Ages,\\" a fine work of criticism which I would have found baffling on the most superficial level without having read Smalley's book, and recognized the contexts of commentators she analyzes.<br /><br />The late Norman Cantor expressed high approval of Beryl Smalley's book in \\"Inventing the Middle Ages,\\" and lamented the neglect of its author by British academic circles, which he attributed to sexism. (He was probably right; but I have no independent source on her life.) He also suggested that the organization of \\"The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages\\" leaves much to be desired. I understand what he means, but I am not sure that I could suggest a better one.<br /><br />The fact is, Beryl Smalley (1905-1984) chose to cover a huge amount of territory, which could be mapped in many ways; and she seems to have tried out more than one. \\"The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages\\" was, by her original intent, restricted to Latin Christian writers interpreting what they called the \\"Old Testament\\" -- \\"New Testament\\" studies were considered \\"Theology,\\" and those who had any sense of self-preservation stayed away from unapproved speculation. Explaining the words of Ezekiel in ever-finer detail, or debating the exact length of the reign of a king of Judah was one thing. Touching on specifically Catholic doctrines, seen as arising from a Gospel or Epistle, was another.<br /><br />Smalley in fact wrote on medieval Gospel interpretations, as well as medieval political thought; areas in which she found herself describing views that came to be deemed heretical. Some of these writings do not seem to have been collected until the 1980s.<br /><br />But she found that this limitation to the Latin Old Testament was, perhaps unexpectedly, too restrictive, and gave a false sense of a closed system of ideas. It may have seemed a safe assumption that St. Jerome was the last important direct contact with Jewish Biblical scholarship until the Renaissance. (Aquinas reading Maimonides on how to reconcile Aristotle and Scripture was a somewhat different matter.) In the course of her work, she came to agree that there was, in fact, a distinct and significant influence from medieval Jewish commentators on Christian writers at certain periods. She had to extend her coverage; but, of course, medieval Hebrew had not been part of her education, so skipping the whole problem must have been a temptation.<br /><br />Instead, she got considerable help from a Hebraist who had been looking into the relation of European Jewish commentators, from Rashi to Kimhi, to their Christian environment. But she still had to spend a disproportionate amount of space explaining basic facts about them to other medievalists, whereas \\"the Benedictine Reform\\" could pretty much take care of itself. (And if you don't recognize the commentators, but at least know the name of the Benedictines, you are in the same position as many of her original readers.)  Since her associate was also a congregational Rabbi, she lost his direct assistance by the time of the revised edition; he assumed a new position out of the country. (And the whole picture of Jewish commentators has since been altered by later scholarship; although I don't think that this would make much difference at the level of detail she provided.)<br /><br />But it was a valiant effort. And it was typical of her industry and enthusiasm. And also of the resulting sprawling, and seemingly disproportioned, nature of her account. In the end, the book seemed to me much too short; much of it already needed to be replaced, but I could think of nothing that should have been cut.<br /><br />The issues she raises concern not only religion, but the entire nature of literacy and interpretation of the written world in medieval society. I would strongly urge anyone seriously interested in medieval European intellectual culture to try it; and not only those with a special interest in religion or biblical studies.<br /><br />Although it was not Beryl Smalley's only book, it is the only one in print; and for the moment apparently only in the U.S. Amazon UK offers it among a wider selection of Smalley titles, all unavailable except used. That list includes \\"The Bible in the Mediaeval World: Essays in Memory of Beryl Smalley (Studies in Church History)\\" (1985).<br /><br />[Addendum, 2012; This review was written in 2005; Amazon (US) now provides an extensive list of Smalley's publications, many of which are in print, or are/were otherwise available.]	2005-01-09
US	30081986	R2Q2VQ2BJYIK89	0140441034	263160544	Njal's Saga (Classics)	Books	5	43	43	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Reliable, Readable, Option	This is a highly readable translation (although not the only one) of a work of literature that has several familiar names. In full, it is &#34;Brennu-Njals Saga,&#34; or &#34;The Story of Burned Njal,&#34; but just plain &#34;Njals-Saga&#34; is equally correct. And, like several other sagas, it has a nickname in its native Iceland, &#34;Njala&#34; (like &#34;Grettla,&#34; for &#34;Grettir's Saga&#34;). It is generally conceded to be the outstanding monument of a burst of literary productivity at the very edge of medieval European civilization. For those who know it, with its unforgettable portraits of men and women presented through their responses to the events that entangle them, it has a place alongside the great novels of modern Europe. It demands patience of the reader; although it starts off with a couple of resounding scandals, including a Queen-Mother's affair with a handsome Icelander, before plunging into disputes over property, and who stole the hay, and wise advice that is never followed. (There are certain resemblances to Westerns; including the problem of subsistence in an unforgiving environment, and the critical importance of a reputation.)  Magnus Magnussson and Hermann Palsson made the decision to give a plain-language version, which I think has stood up well for over forty years (first published 1960). On my first reading I found the Introduction, Genealogical Tables, Glossary of Proper Names, Note on Chronology, and maps, all very useful. It has been supplanted in the Penguin Classics list by a new translation by Robert Cook, but I hope that this older version will continue to remain available. (Penguin sometimes has two, or even three, translations of a given work in circulation.)  &#34;Njal's Saga&#34; is, like several others, a long account of cascading disputes between farmers, and the resulting fights and lawsuits, broken up with voyages and adventures in Viking-Age Europe. (There are a great many shorter ones on the same basic pattern, generally less complex and diverse.) &#34;Njala&#34; includes a famous account of the official conversion of Iceland to Christianity, and a description of the Battle of Clontarf in Ireland, just over a decade later -- both apparently drawn from pre-existing accounts, and both inserted into the sequence of events quite naturally, although possibly with some violence to chronology.  The co-translators' most dramatic departure from the Icelandic text was the decision to relegate most genealogical descriptions of characters to footnotes. Many chapters begin something like &#34;There was a man named A who lived at B. He was the son of C, son of D, son of E, who was the first who came to B, and he was the son of F, son of G, the kinsman of ...&#34; Those of us who persist in reading the major sagas will soon learn to decipher such passages to mean either, &#34;A came from a famous family, and would have many allies in a dispute,&#34; or &#34;A was a complete nobody, whose most notable ancestors were famed only for being violent and unreasonable.&#34; Until then, these paragraph-long descriptions are just a jumble of names -- there is a &#34;Monty Python&#34; routine based on that impression, which is very, very funny if you know the sagas; and, I am told, amusing anyway if you don't.  &#34;Njala&#34; has had a long series of translations from its original Old Icelandic into other languages -- there is a whole book on its &#34;reception&#34; into other literatures, &#34;The Rewriting of Njals Saga: Translation, Ideology, and Icelandic Sagas,&#34; by Jon Karl Helgason. And it bulks large in Andrew Wawn's &#34;The Vikings and the Victorians,' because it received a magnificent first translation into English, by George Webbe Dasent, &#34;The Story of Burnt Njal, or, Life in Iceland at the End of the Tenth Century,&#34; pubished in 1861. Dasent had begun work in 1843, but the whole subject was still so unfamiliar that Dasent, probably wisely, spent a good part of the two-volume first edition just explaining medieval Iceland to his readers. This material was dumped in later, one-volume editions of Dasent's translation, including the Everyman's Library reprint of 1911, which got a new introduction and select bibliography by E.O.G. Turville-Petre in 1957. It was available in paperback in the 1970s, in competition with the Penguin Classics translation.  Dasent's &#34;Burnt Njal&#34; has many merits, even today. Unfortunately, between Dasent's decision to imitate the Icelandic vocabulary and sentences, and changes in English since the 1850s, many will find his prose indigestible; and the 1772 edition of the saga he was using is now *very* obsolete. For those who want a look, there is an HTML edition on-line; the translator's name is there given as DaSent. Modern readers can turn to Jesse Byock's &#34;Viking Age Iceland&#34; for an equivalent of Dasent's introduction and appendices, with their maps and diagrams; it is much more readable, as well as much more reliable. And I would certainly make the suggestion of Magnusson and Palsson as a better place to start with Njal and his associates.  Another alternative is the American-Scandinavian Foundation's 1955 &#34;Njal's Saga,&#34; translated by Carl F. Bayerschmidt and Lee M. Hollander. For American readers it had the slight advantage of not being quite so British in tone as the Penguin translation (let alone the mid-Victorian Dasent!); but it seems to have been available in recent years only in a 1998 paperback from a British publisher, in the &#34;Wordsworth Classics of World Literature&#34; series, with a new introduction by Thorsteinn Gylfason. It too has maps, family trees, and notes.  There is a substantial critical literature on &#34;Njal's Saga,&#34; some of it in English. Richard F. Allen's old &#34;Fire and Iron: Critical Approaches to Njals Saga&#34; is very literary in approach. Jesse Byock's &#34;Feud in the Icelandic Saga,&#34; which argues that behavior in the sagas reflects real social patterns, has thirty pages on this saga (Chapter 9, &#34;Two Sets of Feud Chains&#34;), which I think are brilliant; but probably most helpful to those who already know the story, and can appreciate how he makes connections between scattered-looking events.  For those who find &#34;Njala&#34; a bit too long to start with, there are variety of other sagas in excellent translations -- and also some not-so-good translations. Going strictly by the sagas themselves, other good places to start would be &#34;Laxdaela Saga,&#34; which shares some important characters, scenes and events with &#34;Njala,&#34; &#34;Grettir's Saga,&#34; the story of a famous outlaw, with some wonderful accounts of battles with supernatural as well as human enemies; and &#34;Egil's Saga&#34; (Egils Saga Skallagrimssonar; &#34;Egla&#34; for short), which is closer to the popular idea of an Icelandic saga. The hero is a warrior-poet, brilliant, bad-tempered, and remarkably ugly; he takes after his grandfather, who was nicknamed &#34;Evening-Wolf,&#34; and suspected of being a shape-shifter, and Egil spends much of his time on Viking adventures abroad, instead of tending the flocks ... .  Incidentally, &#34;Njala,&#34; &#34;Laxdaela,&#34; and &#34;Egla&#34; all contribute, along with the master-narrative of Snorri Sturluson's &#34;Heimskringla&#34; (a long saga-history of the Kings of Norway) to the late Poul Anderson's fine historical novel, &#34;Mother of Kings,&#34; which is another approach to the world of the sagas.  [Addendum, September 2015: As noted in my response to one of the comments below, I had forgotten that I had reviewed this translation  separately. It turns out that it had been dropped from the Penguin Classics, and replaced by a different translation, which I described in a review of a Kindle version of Dasent's translation, as follows:   &#34;The most recent translation, by Robert Cook, is readily available in paperback and Kindle editions. It was originally published in 1997,as part of a set of &#34;The Complete Sagas of the Icelanders,&#34; and was issued separately by Penguin Books in 2002. Cook, like Dasent, aimed at reproducing as much as possible the spare prose style of the Icelandic original, and doing so without the archaic vocabulary and dialect words that Dasent sometimes adopted (usually related to the Icelandic form; a precedent followed by William Morris and E.R. Eddison). Whether Cook succeeded, or just raised a barrier to appreciation of the saga, is a matter of some dispute. Some reviewers have compared it unfavorably to the translation which it (unfortunately) replaced in the Penguin list, by Magnus Magnusson and Hermann Palsson. They made the decision to give a plain-language version, which I think stood up well for over forty years (first published 1960). I have reviewed it at some length (along with a comparison to Dasent), and I must say that I think it is a better entry into the saga literature than either Dasent or Cook. These days one has to find it in a library, or as a used book.&#34;  See also the &#34;Comments&#34; below for my advice on how most easily to find the Cook translation on Amazon, as of Sept. 2, 2015.]	2005-01-09
US	30081986	R1X0I6ANTNL28T	0520082591	220674825	Feud in the Icelandic Saga	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Finding a New Path in Familiar Places	It has been nearly a quarter-century century since UCLA's Professor Jesse Byock completed this book (the copyright date is 1982; Amazon's date of 1993 for the paperback edition is for that format only). It marks an attempt to reverse a long-prevailing view of a whole body of literature, the Sagas of the Icelanders. It is not easy reading; but it repays the effort it takes. It has been well received; there is even a Japanese translation of the book, along with Byock's later \\"Medieval Iceland.\\"     I had been reading sagas in translation since the late 1960s, and on reading this book I had the distinct feeling that I had never quite understood them properly. Almost as if, say, I hadn't grasped the function of a jury in stylized accounts of trials, like \\"Perry Mason.\\" Or, more exactly, like missing the functions of lawyers. Byock is credited with a major breakthrough in making clear the essential role of the \\"advocate\\" in feud and resolution narratives.     \\"Sagas of the Icelanders\\" is a category which is not identical to the larger group of Icelandic Sagas. They were all written in Old Icelandic / Old Norse, in a similar style, but the latter designation includes a wide range of topics, including the Kings of Norway, and a variety of heroes from the Migration Age, like Sigurd the Volsung, and Hrolf Kraki and the Skjoldung Dynasty of Denmark. (The Siegfried of the \\"Nibelungenlied\\" and Hrothulf the Scylding in \\"Beowulf,\\" respectively; Byock has, in fact, translated \\"The Saga of the Volsungs,\\" for the University of California Press and Penguin Classics, and \\"The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki,\\" for Penguin Classics.)     When I was taking Icelandic Literature (in translation) at UCLA a decade before this book appeared, the reigning orthodoxy was to take the medieval sagas written in Iceland *about* Icelanders as primarily literary creations. They were fictions about events centuries before they were composed, to be enjoyed, certainly, but to be treated as sophisticated fictions. These works, written in a remarkably lean prose studded with poems of great complexity, give an immediate impression of gritty realism; farmers worry about hay supplies for the winter, large landowners maneuver to acquire more property, and minute details of legal procedure form turning points in lives.     There is nothing like them in the rest of medieval European literature; whereas the Legendary sagas, and various obviously foreign materials (the *Riddara,* or chivalric, Sagas), are built up of stories of kings and warriors, or even knights on horseback (not a natural part of the Icelandic imagination).  But from short works like \\"Hrafnkels Saga,\\" to the massive \\"Brennu-Njals Saga\\" (\\"The Story of Burnt Njal\\"), the Sagas of the Icelanders were to be approached as books of fiction, albeit fiction set in real landscapes, and with some historical personages in the cast of characters.     This was a marked reaction to the one-time view of them as something more like nave reportage of actual events; and it acknowledged their sophistication as narratives, and the highly artistic nature of their seemingly artless prose. But it tended to block their use as evidence of Icelandic life in the Middle Ages; and to forestall attempts to interpret the sagas as self-representations of Icelandic experiences, aimed at ordinary people, instead of the product of elite literary culture, and reflecting foreign influences, albeit in a subtle manner. Never mind evidence that the expensive medieval manuscripts were regarded as treasures to be read aloud to ordinary, isolated, farming households, to entertain guests, or during the long winters. (Actually, the idea of a serialized reading of \\"Njal's Saga,\\" as a kind of radio soap opera, suggests that the periodic scandals and adventures were a good part of its original appeal.)    Jesse Byock has taken a leading position in the rehabilitation of the sagas as historical evidence; not that he regards them as literally true -- although hehas produced evidence for a startling level of accuracy in some overlooked or misunderstood details in some of them. Instead, he has tried to take them seriously as reflections of the stresses and social patterns of life on the island between the time of settlement (after 870 to around 930) and the late Middle Ages (before, say, the mid-fourteenth century, when some non-saga historical texts may have been redacted.     \\"Feud in the Icelandic Saga\\" is an enormously impressive analysis of the recurring patterns of dispute, arbitration, and resolution or non-resolution, in the saga-literature. He does not take individual sagas as true-to-life accounts of specific events. Instead, he shows that the recurring patterns correspond to the expected stresses of life in a subsistence economy, unable to support a fully-developed state, and that the \\"purely literary\\" patterns are the sort of thing that medieval Icelanders would have recognized as both probable and instructive.     Byock has returned to these issues many times since, in articles and books. \\"Medieval Iceland: Society, Sagas, and Power\\" (1988), also from the University of California Press, was more recently joined by \\"Viking Age Iceland\\" (2001), from Penguin. The two books return to some of the saga narratives analyzed in \\"Feud,\\" this time from broader perspectives that include the degradation of the Icelandic ecosystem in the centuries following the Settlement. (Unlike \\"Feud,\\" either could probably serve as an introduction to the saga literature; but \\"Viking Age Iceland\\" is probably by far the more approachable, and deals with issues, like the role of women, for which much evidence is from outside the saga literature.)     \\"Feud,\\" however, still remains an impressive accomplishment. To my mind, it makes a convincing case for treating the saga-literature as \\"true\\" representations of medieval Iceland, albeit in a sociological, rather than a naively historical 'just-as-it-happened,\\" sense. And even for those who maywant to reject the argument, the analyses of specific sagas are exceptionally clear and compelling -- at least to those of us who have puzzled over some of the stories.	2005-01-08

I do think it is important to point out that the book belongs to the early twentieth century, and reflects its values. Readers should be prepared to make allowances for this, or not bother. Of course, those who pass it by will be missing some first-class storytelling.     Andrews, who first came to the attention of scientists as a skilled taxidermist, shows his enthusiasm for turning live animals into specimens for mounting. Despite praise of individual Asian acquaintances, he falls into ethnic stereotypes whenever he deals with nations or groups for any length of time. Some of his judgements on foreign cultures must have seemed odd, even at the time. Maybe the decline of Lamaism would restore the \\"virility of the Mongol nation\\" -- whatever that means. But if it means anything, why would he find it so desirable? If Andrews didn't remember Genghis Khan, the Chinese and the Russians certainly did!     Ironically, the expedition seems to have made both the first and last Western observations of some traditional Mongolian Buddhist religious observances, later swept away in the aftermath of Russian and Chinese revolutions.     Anyone hoping for accounts of fossil-hunting in the Gobi Desert will also be in for an unpleasant surprise. That belonged to subsequent expeditions, in later years.     Readers interested in the context of this and later Andrews expeditions will probably find Charles Gallenkamp's \\"Dragon Hunter: Roy Chapman Andrews and the Central Asiatic Expeditions\\" their most helpful guide.

US	30081986	R1AEU3PD0LK6EJ	086547009X	654290292	The Divine Woman: Dragon Ladies and Rain Maidens in T'Ang Literature	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: China's Divine Waters	This short book, \\"The Divine Woman,\\" was originally published by the University of California Press in 1973. It is one of a series of studies of T'ang Dynasty China, following the vast \\"The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics\\" (1963) and the briefer  \\"The Vermilion Bird: T'ang Images of the South\\" (1967). Unlike its two predecessors, which concentrated on Chinese contacts with the outside world (\\"Golden Peaches\\") and the lands to the south the T'ang Dynasty was attempting to incorporate into the Empire (\\"Vermilion Bird\\"), \\"The Divine Woman\\" deals mainly with literary developments of Chinese traditions already ancient to the T'ang. It is a book about some of the more obscure corners of Chinese culture, about poetry and short stories, and, incidentally, how foreign influences were assimilated and naturalized to fit Chinese conceptions of the world. The \\"Dragon Ladies and Rain Maidens\\" are the stars of a large cast of supernatural beings -- and some not-so-supernatural ones -- male as well as female.    Other works by Schafer concerning China during the T'ang dynasty are similarly specialized: \\"Pacing the Void: T'ang Approaches to the Stars,\\" \\"Shore of Pearls: Hainan Island in Early Times,\\"  \\"Mirages on the Sea of Time: The Taoist Poetry of Ts'ao T'ang,\\" and, on a major holy place, the very brief monograph \\"Mao Shan in T'ang Times\\" (Society for the Study of Chinese Religions, 1980, 1989). Schafer had a gift for evocative titles (one wonders what he wanted to call the \\"Mao Shan\\" study). [See below for possible new editions of these and other books by Schafer.]    Goddesses and other supernatural women, ghosts, and a variety of dragons and water-monsters share the pages with sacred mountains and rivers (Those familiar only  with the standard, mostly benevolent, *lung*  as \\"the Chinese dragon\\" may be in for a shock at the range of creatures Schafer catalogues.) A fair amount of linguistic and ethnographic information is provided, and there are plenty ofnotes to satisfy Schafer's fellow Sinologists. As often in Chinese studies, much of the secondary literature turns out to be in Japanese -- very, very appropriately, in this case, since it was T'ang China which provided the first great foreign model for Japan (which in turn preserved elements of Chinese culture that were nearly obliterated in China itself -- another story). Some of the themes treated here were fully naturalized in Japan, and now show up in manga and anime.     The North Point Press edition ten years later added a laudatory Foreword by Gary Snyder. Unfortunately, many readers will really need, instead, a brief introduction to the T'ang Dynasty, one of the great periods of Chinese history, roughly equivalent to the High Middle Ages in Europe (but a few centuries earlier in time). Fortunately, there are a number of political and cultural histories of China, and some excellent anthologies of Chinese literature (see below), even though most of those Schafer cites are now dated and often difficult to obtain.     A major theme of \\"The Divine Woman\\" is how the Confucian official ethos attempted, with considerable success, to historicize, trivialize, and sentimentalize the ancient goddesses of China, and how versions of them lived on in popular culture, surfacing in literature from time to time. Schafer translates and interprets a selection of poems and summarizes other literature. Despite Schafer's complaints of the tedium of poems loaded with stock images, his descriptions of the best of the poems and stories make one long for an anthology of his favorites. Fortunately, a good selection of this material now can be found, along with much else, in Stephen Owen's huge \\"An Anthology of Chinese Literature: Beginnings to 1911\\" (1996).    Although fuller details on the T'ang would have been nice in this context, I have also been impressed by Jacques Gernet's comprehensive \\"A History of Chinese Civilization\\" (1972; translated 1982, second edition 1996), with a helpful English-language bibliography, very much including Schafer; another very large book to serve as a companion to the richly packed, but surprisingly brief, \\"The Divine Woman.\\" Schafer's own \\"History of China\\" is available in digital format (missing half a dozen maps), and sometimes used -- but besides being out of date, is no more than a brief introduction to the major political events and social trends.    Note, May 2005: There is now underway a project of reissuing in paperback Schafer's out-of-print works (essentially everything except \\"The Golden Peaches of Samarkand') by the Antique Collectors' Club and Floating World Editions, beginning with \\"Pacing the Void\\" and \\"Tu Wan's Stone Catalogue of Cloudy Forest: A Commentary and Synopsis\\" on March 30. The former was originally scheduled for release about a year ago, by Weatherhill Inc. according to the  original listing, but is now actually in my hand. See the Amazon pages for these two works for other details. No date has been announced for their edition of \\"The Divine Woman.\\" (Meanwhile, some of the asking prices for used copies have become more reasonable.)

Waters gives a political / moral explication of a group of poems which modern scholarship has treated as fairly direct literary adaptations of popular (or regional) religious texts. His exposition incorporates the basic Chinese commentaries (in translation); which I find extremely valuable in itself. And Waters gives them an impressive interpretation / application.     The poems in question come from a sequence known as \\"The Nine Songs\\" (actually a group of eleven; the title is variously explained) in a collection known as \\"Ch'u Tz'u (in the old Wade-Giles system for rendering Chinese. All or portions of the sequence have been rendered many times; and there is a complete translation of the whole collection, which contains both Warring States and Han Dynasty texts, by David Hawkes. (I have reviewed the revised edition of his \\"Songs of the South,\\" where I give more details of the problems, and various translations; unfortunately, Penguin has allowed it to go out of print.)     As it happens, I think that Waters underestimates the amount of traditional religion active in the poems, and that the highly specific interpretations he gives are an over-reading. The poems can successfully be read as literary imitations or adaptations of rituals invoking spirits, and considering this a mere cover for a more dignified setting seems to me almost a mirror-image of the Christian reading of one of Virgil's poems as religious instead of political.     Of course, I do not claim any independent value for my judgment, but the readings proposed by Arthur Waley, David Hawkes, and Edward Schafer, among others, seem to me to make excellent sense, and do not require assuming that Han Dynasty critical methods were current so early. Or that all Chinese men of letters of the Warring States period had assimilated Confucian readings of the \\"Shih Ching,\\" or  \\"Book of Songs,\\" into their habits of composition.     However, Waters has a couple of millennia of astute native readers on his side, many of whom did write poetry with this type of reading in mind. Whether or not the shamanistic reading of the poems in question continues to be the standard model, or the court-politics interpretation re-assumes its primacy, \\"Three Elegies of Ch'u\\" has a value of its own, as an intelligent and sympathetic presentation of traditional Chinese literary culture.

US	30081986	R3GUX1JNTMFI10	1587156423	168901272	The House of the Wolfings	Books	5	14	16	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Saga-like, but Not A Saga	Unfortunately, the description provided for this pioneering fantasy novel opens with the statement that \\"The House of the Wolfings\\" is one of the Icelandic sagas translated by William Morris and Eirkr Magnusson. (Note: this is the same William Morris responsible for poetry, tapestries, stained glass, furniture, fine printing of books, wallpaper designs, and preservationist and socialist agitation.) Whoever wrote the description seems to have been thinking of \\"Three Northern Love-Stories,\\" \\"The Story of Sigurd the Volsung,\\" and the great \\"Saga Library.\\"    Would that it were so! A genuine Icelandic saga about the lives of the Goths in Roman times would be a real gem, no matter how little connection it had with antiquity. However, the closest we come to such a work is the variously named \\"Saga of Hervor\\" or \\"Saga of King Heidrek the Wise,\\" one of the \\"legendary sagas\\" in which the sword named Tyrfing and a handful of allusions in poems reveal the original setting of parts of the story among the Goths (including the group known as \\"Tervingi\\") and Huns, on the European mainland. And some historical Gothic leaders wander into stories, mainly borrowed from German sources, most obviously Thidrek in the \\"Volsunga Saga\\" and \\"Thidrek's Saga\\" -- the Dietrich von Bern of the \\"Nibelungenlied\\" and other Middle High German stories. But these last seem to be literary borrowings; interesting, but as Goths not all that different from the Britons from Arthurian legend and the Russians from the Kiev Cycle who also appear (albeit less prominently) in the eclectic Thidrek collection.    \\"The House of the Wolfings\\" is Morris' own attempt to recreate the life of the Gothic tribes, in a style influenced by the sagas, but not imitating them. Originally published in 1888, it was followed the next year by the similar \\"Roots of the Mountains\\". Both give a romantic view of the Germanic tribes, filled with images of folk-solidarity and kin-loyalty. Morris' reconstruction, leaving aside the fantasy elements, is an interesting mixture of primitivism, early Marxist sociology, and a real (if not very sophisticated) study of early Germanic languages.     Even as Morris was writing, a similar mixture, but with the linguistic basis replaced by pseudo-biology, was being popularized by, among others, Wagner and his followers. It is important to keep the distinction between them clear. In Morris' fiction, the Goths are simple, honest, and hardworking homebodies, and the Romans are intruding imperialists. No glorification of conquest for conquest's sake here. Whether this is a realistic portrait is, of course, another matter.     It is Morris' imaginative effort at recreating a lost age which makes \\"The House of the Wolfings\\" a landmark in the development of fantasy literature, alongside the more purely imaginary realms and times of Morris' other prose romances. Those who enjoy his medievalizing prose and sometimes leisurely story-telling will find this book worth their time, and some readers regard it as a lost treasure. Those who enjoy fantasy, or Victorian literature, should definitely give it a try.    Those who may be doubtful about Morris' archaizing prose -- nothing nearly as elaborate as E.R. Eddison's, but neither typically Victorian nor modern -- may want to check for on-line versions of this, and some of his other romances, before deciding to buy. (I find reading on-line texts extremely wearing; so I am not suggesting relying on them.)    Those interested in the actual *history* of the Goths may want to look at a recent responsible popular account in Heather's \\"The Goths\\" in the \\"Peoples of Europe\\" series, and then at the nearly contemporary translation of Herwig Wolfram's massively documented and argumentative \\"History of the Goths\\" -- I have reviewed both. A full account, in English, of the Goths appearing in medieval literature (Theodoric / Dietrich / Thidrek, his vassal Hildebrand, and others) would be welcome; but \\"House of the Wolfings\\" belongs to Victorian England, not medieval Iceland.

Among surviving collections of poetic texts, the &#34;Ch'u Tz'u&#34; (Wade-Giles transliteration) is supposedly second in age only to the &#34;Book of Songs,&#34; traditionally edited by Confucius himself. Waley also translated other poems from the collection, published over an extended period in various of his collections. Waley's translations, as usual, are superb. His assessment of the relation of the texts to archaic Chinese religion is in line with widely, but not universally, accepted, views. He treats them as literary recreations of the songs of actual practitioners of shamanistic rites, the &#34;wu&#34; of ancient Chinese histories. (&#34;Wu&#34; are often defined as women, and so not proper advisors to rulers -- but in fact this may be part of a Confucian-driven effort to force their beliefs and rituals out of the Han Dynasty's &#34;New China.&#34;)  A complete translation of the collection, with commentary, was eventually offered by David Hawkes in 1959  (Clarendon Press, Oxford; Beacon Press Paperback, Boston 1962), with a second, extensively revised, edition in 1985, as &#34;The Songs of the South: An Anthology of Ancient Chinese Poems by Qu Yuan and Other Poets,&#34; in the Penguin Classics series. Despite Hawkes' modest disclaimers, his commentary to the second edition is largely new, and the translations are also altered in many places. He also took the opportunity to change over from the Wade-Giles system of rendering Chinese to the official Pinyin system.  Unhappily, the revised edition is, like Waley's version, out of print; either is worth reading, both would be better. [Belated Addendum, 2016: Happily, the Penguin Classic edition is back in print, and in Kindle as well as paperback.] Selections from Hawkes' *original* versionhave been anthologized, notably in Cyril Birch's &#34;Anthology of Chinese Literature: From Early Times to the Fourteenth Century&#34; (1965), which seems to stay in print.  Perhaps more conveniently, entirely new translations of all eleven of the &#34;Nine Songs,&#34; the beautiful and difficult &#34;Li Sao,&#34; and several other pieces from the collection, along with later imitations and variously affiliated compositions, are included in Stephen Owen's &#34;An Anthology of Chinese Literature: Beginnings to 1911&#34; (1996) -- see mainly &#34;The *Chu-ci*: 'Lyrics of Chu',&#34; pages 155-175, and &#34;The *Chu-ci* Tradition,&#34; pages 176-203,&#34; with &#34;Calling Back the Soul,&#34; pages 204-214. (The transliteration as &#34;Chu-ci&#34; is the Pinyin equivalent of &#34;Ch'u Tz'u.&#34;)  I am not as fond of Owens' translations of the same works; but with Waley and Hawkes as predecessors, he had steep competition, and, as a latecomer in the field, had to overcome a certain nostalgia on my part. I certainly would not discourage anyone from starting with his splendid, if very heavy, volume.  The interpretation of the &#34;Nine Songs&#34; and other poems in the collection remains controversial. A defense of the (essentially) Confucian political-moral reading was offered by Geoffrey Waters, in &#34;Three Elegies of Ch'u: An Introduction to the Traditional Interpretation of the Ch'u Tz'u&#34; in 1985; it was more recently reissued by University Microfilms, and this edition too is out of print; but the volume is often available used, through Amazon, and elsewhere. Whether or not one accepts that the longing of the &#34;wu&#34; for the divine companion/lover should be understand as the longing of an honest minister of state for the Royal presence, Waters offers a look at how the Chinese literary class (which is to say the social elite) read their own classics.  An interpretation in line with those by Waley and Hawkes was accepted by Edward Schafer, in his 1973 studyof &#34;The Divine Woman: Dragon Ladies and Rain Maidens in T'ang Literature,&#34; in which he explores the collection's literary influence in later times. Unhappily, this work -- for which Owens' &#34;Anthology&#34; is a nearly perfect companion, offering some of the T'ang Dynasty works he discusses -- is also out of print, in both its University of California Press hardcover and later commercial paperback editions; prices recently asked for the latter have been more reasonable than in past years. (As of mid-2005, a new edition has been promised for sometime in the near future -- in a publishing project that was already running a year late.)  [Addendum, November 2016: the promised re-issue of &#34;The Divine Woman&#34; is still not available, although *still* listed as forthcoming by Amazon. Another site now gives an expected publication date of December 2016....]  I have reviewed Schafer's book, as well as the Hawkes translation, and Waters' treatment of selected poems and their traditional commentaries, at greater length; inevitably there is a fair amount of overlap in these three treatments. I have also reviewed a book which offers a different, but compatible, perspective on the mythological worlds of ancient China, including that reflected in the &#34;Nine Songs,&#34; Anne Birrell's &#34;Chinese Mythology: An Introduction&#34; (1993), which is an invaluable combination of texts and commentaries; it should not be confused with her little British Museum volume, &#34;Chinese Myths.&#34;	2005-01-05

Mythical and heroic narratives from before the Han Dynasty are rare, often incomplete, and usually frustratingly allusive; and often are not narratives, but applications of parts of presumably well-known stories to illustrate a point. And they usually have survived in a form considered \\"rational\\" by generations of Confucian editors.<br /><br />There have been a few useful, but all-too-brief, presentations by qualified Sinologists, notably Derk Bodde. Other serious discussions by qualified Western scholars, however, often bog down in discussions of textual problems, the age and authority of sources, and other important issues, without ever explaining what a story is about.<br /><br />For this reason alone, Anne M. Birrell's \\"Chinese Mythology: An Introduction\\" is welcome. Actual translations of texts are provided, with useful discussions and annotations intelligible to non-Sinologists like this reader. In addition, the author/translator/editor writes with grace and clarity. One comes away feeling that the confusing nature of the source has not been amplified by the presentation, and that the cultural issues they seem to address have been identified with reasonable certainty.<br /><br />It is also an extremely interesting book, usually offering several versions of each of the stories, illustrating the various ways they have been told, and their persistence in Chinese culture. They are grouped thematically, and a myth which contains a variety of themes usually gets one major treatment, and relatively abbreviated consideration under other headings. A few get treated from different perspectives at somewhat greater length. Some readers will probably object to flipping back and forth, but the alternative was considerable repetition, which Birrell hasgracefully avoided.<br /><br />As a result of reading this book with the attention it inspires, I have actually been able to appreciate the depth of learning and insight concealed in some of the earlier scholarship (such as that of Bernhard Karlgren and Wolfram Eberhard). Anne Birrell has also been responsible for some attractive translations of interesting, but so far obscure, Chinese literature, and this reader hopes to see more of them.<br /><br />This book should not be confused with Anne Birrell's short illustrated volume on \\"Chinese Myths,\\" for the British Museum's \\"Legendary Past\\" series.<br /><br />(Reposted from my \\"anonymous\\" review of September 12, 2003.)	2005-01-05
US	30081986	R26LRTK6EDV6XL	0939218062	69101237	The Age Of Fighting Sail: The Story of the Naval War of 1812	Books	5	48	49	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Wide-Ranging Narrative	Forester's sober, but generally fast-moving, account of the Anglo-American naval war of 1812 has had a mixed reception from historians over the nearly fifty years since its first publication. Looking at bibliographies and suggested readings in several volumes, I noted that one ignores it, while another grants that, \\"as to be expected from the creator of Hornblower,\\" it is enjoyable reading.    (Actually, it is rather far from the Hornblower narratives, which are in surprisingly large part about the inner life of the shy, sensitive, Gibbon-reading hero, who happens to be, to his own constant surprise, a resourceful and highly-effective naval warrior. Forester does describe Hornblower's naval engagements at a level of detail not found in the history, which is not much longer than one of the novels.)    It has also been described as \\"potted Mahan,\\" which under-emphasizes every subsequent historian's debt to the Admiral to suggest that Forester was especially susceptible. Another writer -- with whom I am in agreement -- points out that \\"The Age of Fighting Sail\\" is one of the few accounts of the naval war to emphasize that it was closely related to the war on land, and not some set of uniquely nautical events. (Which is what Mahan argued about naval wars in general; why complain that Forester had learned it better than others?).    At least a few have noted that Forester made some points, not by laborious argument with elaborate documentation, but, even more effectively, by quoting relevant passages from the Duke of Wellington's correspondence -- a contemporary authority of some considerable weight, but not often mentioned in this context. Whether or not his advice to get out of the war had a decisive influence in London, it is a telling example of the impression the conflict made on a hard-headed strategist. Especially when American privateers had complicated life for British diplomats, with embarrassing illustrations that Britain did not exactly rule the waves unchallenged, even after Napoleon was gone.    Forester gives a good idea of the shock value of a series of American victories in single-ship encounters, which the Royal Navy had long counted on winning as a matter of course. The accounts of some of the individual engagements are actually quite clear -- if you have read other, properly illustrated versions. Which brings us to a problem which is probably not Forester's fault.    A series of publishers have not, I fear, ever given the book the proper treatment. In 1956 it needed, and it still needs, a good bibliography, a very detailed index, usable maps, and diagrams of the naval engagements. In effect, it has fallen somewhere between, on one side, the academic history or text-book, either of which would have its load of \\"apparatus,\\" and, on the other,  the purely popular book, with lots of illustrations (good or bad). And it has received neither.    So I have to agree to some extent with those who refer to Theodore Roosevelt's 1882 account of \\"The Naval War of 1812,\\" which has the kind of documentation and diagrams Forester's account doesn't. Of course, it also has Roosevelt's personal war with nineteenth-century historiography, both British (competent, but heavy with bias) and American (often not even competent). For those seriously interested, it had a very nice paperback edition from Da Capo Press, in 1999. Just keep in mind that it now over a century out of date. (By the way, Forester seems to me to have read Roosevelt with care; so much for just re-writing Mahan.)    Another Da Capo reprint, from 1995, John R. Elting's \\"Amateurs, To Arms! A Military History of the War of 1812\\" (originally 1991) attempts to integrate naval and land strategy, primarily from the Army's viewpoint. It has a much more up-to-date bibliography than Roosevelt, obviously. Elting too has to spend time clearing away patriotic myths; this time Canadian as well.    One thing that Forester does not deal with is the causes of the war. A long tradition of American historiography has looked to domestic reasons, including land-hungry westerners with designs on Canada. Bradford Perkins' \\"Prologue to War: England and the United States, 1805-1812,\\" detailing the animosities and frictions, gives the impression that the real question is not why a war took place, but why it happened then, after being avoided for so long.    Oh yes. I can hardly imagine trying to digest Forester's prose in an audio format, although I'm sure that, properly read, it sounds great.	2005-01-05

Bury delivered the lectures on which it is based after being appointed Professor of Modern History. This was not a personal whim. British institutional usage (that is, what was done at Oxford and Cambridge) had long divided time between \\"Classical\\" and \\"Modern.\\" Until well into the twentieth century, medievalists held the \\"Modern History\\" chairs. Bury was doing what was expected of him. And very well, I might add.  <br /> <br />Despite dating from the 1920s, Bury is an excellent place to start, but the fact that these are essentially lectures limits their usefulness. Those seriously interested in more up-to-date information on the period might turn to Peter Heather's \\"The Goths,\\" and continue with the elaborately documented consideration of the evidence in Herwig Wolfram's \\"History of the Goths\\" (translated from the German). The differences between those two books will illuminate how much that Bury could take for granted is now open to debate. Peter Llewellyn's \\"Rome in the Dark Ages\\" is easier reading, and concentrates on a single region, but the invaders are incidental players in his narrative.  <br /> <br />(Reposted from my \\"anonymous\\" review of September 11, 2003)	2005-01-03
US	30081986	RETRI9KQOUP8F	0870232061	796145601	Gods and Heroes of the Greeks: The "Library" of Apollodorus	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Ancient Handbook of Ancient Myth	This is one of several translations of an ancient (date disputed) compilation of summaries of stories of the gods and heroes of Greece (but not Rome), based, where it can be checked, on excellent sources. If the name of the author is correct, he cannot be the &#34;Apollodorus the Grammarian&#34; to whom the work used to be attributed, but given the lack of fraudulent internal claims, the bare name seems to me better than &#34;Pseudo-Apollodorus&#34;. Given the huge amount of classical literature that has been lost, and the primary sources to which this compiler seems to have had access (whoever and whenever he was), it is even more regrettable that a portion of &#34;The Library&#34; survives only in an abridged form. (Fortunately, part of the re-summarized material is Homeric; unfortunately, some of it is not.)  This translation features extensive commentary giving detailed comparisons to other classical versions of the divine and heroic stories, combined with surveys of modern literary uses of the stories. The latter is now dated, of course, and Sir James Frazer (of &#34;The Golden Bough&#34;) gave even more information from ancient sources in his commentary (with translation facing a Greek text) of 1921 (two volumes in the Loeb Classical Library). But Michael Simpson is clear, and, on the whole, well organized. Some readers seem to have found the language too American for their taste. It should be remembered that the author, whoever he was, used a kind of &#34;international literary Greek,&#34; which probably seemed fairly up-to-date to his well-educated readers. Whether academic American English is a good substitute is certainly arguable.  The index is not nearly as comprehensive as that in Keith Aldrich's rival version of 1975 (now out of print), but it usually helpful, and Aldrich does not discuss other ancient versions in any detail, or refer to modern literary versions. A recent translation by Robin Hard also has a better index (several, in fact), and is fairly good on ancient variants, but likewise avoids treatment of modern versions of the old stories. Simpson's commentary appears as endnotes to sections of the main text, which makes for frequent interruptions, but I have used this edition for a quarter century with considerable enjoyment, and frequent enlightenment about other ancient works.  Simpson's translation lacks the textual notes and apparatus of Robin Hard's 1997 translation, and Hard's introduction and commentary show both a later stage of classical studies and a more sophisticated view of the structure of &#34;The Library&#34;. The two translations meet different needs, and it is good to have both available. If Aldrich was reprinted to join Frazer's more expensive translation (with Greek text), one might have to make a hard decision about how many versions can be afforded, and how much shelf space they deserve. As it is, the serious student and the lover of ancient literature may want to have both Simpson and Hard at hand, or in a convenient library; Frazer's edition can be consulted on-line at the Perseus site (but is rather difficult to read as presented there).  The Leonard Baskin illustrations are, in my opinion, an attractive feature; Aldrich's translation was also illustrated. However, a good selection of ancient art portraying (or possibly portraying) some of the stories or characters would also be welcome. But an edition &#34;Illustrated from Ancient Monuments&#34; would introduce another set of problems; for which, see Timothy Gantz, &#34;Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources.&#34;  [Addendum, March 2016: A truncated version of Frazer's 1921 two-volume translation-with-commentary has been published as a Kindle book, &#34;The Library of Apollodorus,&#34; by Delphi Classics, as Delphi Ancient Classics Book 62. I have reviewed it, concentrating on what is lacking, and how it can be supplemented with on-line resources (mainly pdfs). I have also reviewed Robin Hard's translation for the Oxford University Press (Oxford World's Classics). Another complete translation has been also been published, &#34;Apollodorus' Library and Hyginus' Fabulae: Two Handbooks of Greek Mythology,&#34; from Hackett; the translation, portions of which had appeared previously, is by R.

US	30081986	RJ4OVBU4EMHBX	0500271771	573225816	Gods of the North	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Interesting, Handle With Care	John Lindow advises against Branston's \\"Gods of the North\\" in a bibliographic essay in his excellent  \\"Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs\\" (2001). In fact, he doesn't mention the (slightly revised) 1980 Thames and Hudson reprinting, but only the 1955 Vanguard edition.<br /><br />He doesn't bother to explain why, but I think I can guess. From a teacher's point of view, the book, with its eccentric and / or obsolete technical terminology, speculations offered as solid conclusions, and general lack of linguistic or critical rigor, must be an unwanted distraction. Branston wrote well enough that his readers may have trouble un-learning his mistakes; and there are a great many of them.<br /><br />His infectious enthusiasm is still a delight; but it is not a trustworthy guide.<br /><br />On the other hand, for those who are already somewhat familiar with the subject, and able to separate out medieval text from modern interpretation  -- and H. R. Ellis Davidson's old-reliable \\"Gods and Myths of Northern Europe\\" (Penguin) might be sufficient -- it does offer new ways of looking at the material. Ways which may hold the interest of those apathetic about phonology and grammar, but not yet prepared to grapple with the difficult problems posed by the sources.<br /><br />For example: the manuscript illumination of \\"The Tree of Jesse\\" which Branston offers (Plate 6) is not *proof* of his Freudian interpretation of the World-Tree Yggdrasill, and its collapse. But it does show that the medieval mind-set *could* have recognized the possibility, and that the suggestion is not merely a modern flight of fancy.<br /><br />But recognizing that this is merely an interesting idea, not a fact, takes a willingness to employ critical thought in the midst of a \\"really good read.\\" Not everyone will bother with it.<br /><br />In addition, Branston quotes a variety of scholars, without too much worry about when they worked, and how their reputations have fared. Thelatter is perhaps justified in some cases; scholarship has its fads, and good work is good work.<br /><br />But Viktor Rydberg, for example, has been out of favor for a long time, for reasons that are clear. Although by some accounts an excellent scholar by nineteenth-century standards (others call him an amateur), Rydberg was also a well-known Swedish poet, and the portions of his work available in English show that he had some trouble keeping his poetic syntheses of myths apart from his sober reconstructions. For Rydberg, parallel myths tended to become the same story, their diverse characters one set, under different names. And Branston tends to follow him into the same trap, albeit on a much more limited scale; a case in point is the section on Svipdag and Mengloth, in late poems sometimes included in editions of the \\"Elder Edda\\" (pages 255-262)<br /><br />Now, another mythologist would point out that, in this case, although Svipdag and Skirnir are involved in similar stories of wooing, the former is the primary character in his story, the latter an agent for the real wooer, the god Freyr; and that most of the similarities belong to folktale motifs, and are not sufficient to establish an original mythological identity. Nor, therefore, do the poems shed any clear light on Norse paganism. This would be boring. But true.<br /><br />I'm glad that I read Branston at a time when my interest in Scandinavian mythology was flagging, mostly for lack of interesting new material. And I'm glad I found a paperback copy of the 1980 edition when it was still in print. But I don't suggest him (or Rydberg, or Jakob Grimm -- see my review of \\"Teutonic Mythology\\") for novices. Too confusing. Too many brilliant errors; and too many just bright and shiny mistakes, as well.<br /><br />Alternatives? One could start with the Davidson volume already mentioned, or its illustrated hardcover versions (slightly abridged), as \\"Scandinavian Mythology\\" (1969) and \\"Viking and Norse Mythology\\" (1996; yes, that is redundant). E.O.G. Turville-Petre's excellent \\"Myth and Religion of the North\\" is occasionally in print, but always too high-priced for the purpose, unless a library copy is available. Lindow's book, although organized as an encyclopedia, is quite readable, and very reliable. Andy Orchard's \\"Dictionary of Norse Myth and Legend\\" from Cassell (with at least three variant titles on Amazon) is even more detailed, although more of a student's companion than an introduction, and is available in a handy mass-market paperback. Rudolf Simek's \\"Dictionary of Northern Mythology\\" is not for beginners, although especially good for language questions, and non-Scandinavian evidence; it is overdue for reprinting. (I've reviewed these last three.)<br /><br />An abundance of choices: I *would* put \\"Gods of the North\\" somewhere on the list, but nowhere near the top.	2005-01-03
US	30081986	R3DJ0MSIVKLN80	0140443754	108889667	The Songs of the South: An Anthology of Ancient Chinese Poems by Qu Yuan and Other Poets (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	32	34	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on A Mysterious Classic	This edition of &#34;Songs of the South&#34;  is a revised form (1985) -- rather more extensively altered than Hawkes' modest description might suggest -- of a complete, and annotated, translation (first edition 1959) of one of the oldest anthologies of Chinese poetry. Among surviving poetic texts, the &#34;Ch'u Tz'u&#34; (Wade-Giles transliteration) is supposedly second in age only to the &#34;Book of Songs,&#34; traditionally edited by Confucius himself. Time and layers of interpretation, mainly derived from an early commentary of uncertain reliability, have made it a difficult work, but it is reputed to contain poetry of great beauty. David Hawkes managed to capture at least some of that beauty, and to supply an interpretive framework, and a great deal of fascinating lore about early Chinese civilization.  Large portions of the &#34;Songs of the South&#34; in fact clearly belong to the Han dynasty, several centuries later. These sections are imitations and extensions of a group of poems supposed to be the work of a certain Qu Yuan (Ch'u Yuan), a minister of the state of Ch'u (Pinyin Qu) in &#34;southern&#34; (now more like central) China, around 300 B.C. These &#34;original&#34; poems are themselves supposed to be imitations of traditional religious songs of the region, written by the minister while in exile from the royal court, and intended as criticism of the king's policies, and treatment of the author. The shamans (men and women) who courted the gods are seen as the minister seeking the king. Their supposed author himself became the subject of a sentimental legend of a noble official who drowned himself rather than witness the destruction of his ruler and country, and was later still connected with the Dragon Boat Festival, which was said to re-enact the search for his body. The exotic and troubling imagery of spirit lovers was thus adjusted to the self-image of the scholar-bureaucrats of Imperial China.  Although this political reading still has its defenders (see Geoffrey R. Waters' &#34;Three Elegies of Ch'u&#34; for an elaborate example), Hawkes spent decades studying this original core as more or less direct reflections of Chinese religion, myth, and legend before they were subjected to Confucian systematization. From this point of view (shared by, among others, Arthur Waley, who also translated a number of these poems), the appropriation of their imagery for Taoist-sounding visionary poems and prose extravaganzas in the rest of the anthology makes perfect sense. A political application of the relations between a shaman (male or female) and a sought-after deity is, of course, not ruled out. The &#34;Nine Songs&#34; (actually there are more; eleven) are extremely moving, whatever interpretation is adopted.  Another of the early poems, &#34;Tian wen,&#34; or &#34;Heavenly Questions,&#34; appears to be a collection of riddles about early gods, kings, and heroes, and is a somewhat opaque source of evidence for early Chinese narratives. Hawkes supplies it with fascinating notes, and cautiously favors the theory that it originally referred to a set of paintings, or perhaps a pictorial map. (Less inclusive examples of both have been turning up in Han Dynasty tombs, so this theory has some physical evidence to support it.)  Of the various translations of this material I have seen, I prefer Hawkes' revised version, but with the Penguin edition currently out of print (although often available used), alternatives may be easier for the curious to find. [Note: this review was originally written in 2005; as of August 2015, the Penguin edition is currently back in print, and apparently has been for quite a while.]  Selections from the *original* (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1959; Beacon Press Paperback, Boston 1962) version of Hawkes' translations have been anthologized, notably in Cyril Birch's &#34;Anthology of Chinese Literature: From Early Times to the Fourteenth Century&#34; (1965), which seems to stay in print.  Among translations by others, Arthur Waley's &#34;The Nine Songs: A Study of Shamanism in Ancient China&#34; (1955) is reprinted from time to time, and his translations from other parts of the collection are scattered through his volumes of Chinese poetry. More conveniently, entirely new translations of all eleven of the &#34;Nine Songs,&#34; the beautiful and difficult &#34;Li Sao,&#34; and several other pieces from the collection, along with later imitations and variously affiliated compositions, are included in Stephen Owen's &#34;An Anthology of Chinese Literature: Beginnings to 1911&#34; (1996) -- see mainly &#34;The *Chu-ci*: 'Lyrics of Chu',&#34; pages 155-175, and &#34;The *Chu-ci* Tradition,&#34; pages 176-203,&#34; with &#34;Calling Back the Soul,&#34; pages 204-214.

Greenfield) set himself the very difficult task of working in a meter which suggests that of the original, but does not depend directly on either its obvious feature of alliteration (likeness of initial sounds of stressed words) or the less obvious patterns of length and stress. The goal, as he explains in &#34;On the Translation,&#34; was equivalency, not imitation. The metrical resemblance is to be found in whole passages, not in specific lines and half-lines.  His choice for this was the unusual purely syllabic line, avoiding use of the standard modern English reliance on metrical units, or feet, with the difference between stressed and unstressed syllables. The lines are mainly nine syllables long, with some shorter or longer (eight or ten), which does reflect the presence of actual variations in Old English meter. This syllabic line tends to produce a caesura, or mid-line pause, which is another marked feature of the original.  (In fact, Benjamin Thorpe, an early nineteenth-century editor of &#34;Beowulf,&#34; printed the half-lines as individual lines, doubling the apparent length, confusing the distinction between pauses and the ends of verses, and sometimes obscuring the alliteration-linking of the half-lines.)  Alliteration appears in the translation, but is not used as a structural principle; a decision which allows for more freedom to select the right word, instead of the one that fits with the rest of the line. (Old English verse had a large specialized vocabulary to fit these needs, with many ways to say things like &#34;sword,&#34; or &#34;warrior,&#34; or &#34;king&#34; -- areas in which modern vocabulary is comparatively impoverished.) The resulting translation flows nicely. Concise footnotes supply clear explanations; and there is additional information in the &#34;Glossary of Proper Names.&#34;  I have a test for translations from the (few) languages with which I have some familiarity. Is a comparison with the original language mutually enlightening? Does it offer interesting ways of looking at the original, and suggest new layers of meaning in the translation?  In this case, some of Greenfield's accomplishments will be noticed only by those already familiar with the Old English, or with a copy of it open while reading the translation. He often uses a Modern English cognate (related by common origin) word, or at least a homophonous (sound-alike) term (whatever the exact etymology) --  although always a clear modern expression, never an obscure and archaic, or completely obsolete word, in the manner of William Morris. (Who at points in his notoriously odd nineteenth-century verse translation seems to have been trying to translate the Old English of  &#34;Beowulf&#34; into something rather like the Middle English of Chaucer; a rather pointless exercise, requiring a glossary of its own.)  With Greenfield, the result is sometimes a quiet pun. Near the opening lines, we learn of a Danish ruler; &#34;Often Scyld Scefing shattered the hosts, / unsettled many a nation's mead-hall...&#34; This is a close-enough rendering of the literal meaning. In the second line, the original has &#34;monegum maegthum  meodosetla ofteah,&#34; &#34;from many kin-groups  mead-benches took away.&#34; (The mead-halls are where the benches would be found, and are implied by the Old English poetic compound.) So &#34;unsettled&#34; here is, first of all, &#34;disturbed,&#34; but also, in this context, is un-settled, &#34;deprived of settles&#34; (backless benches). Not something that leaps out at the reader, and distracts attention away from the work, but present nonetheless. A little reward for those of us who have puzzled over how best to translate the unfamiliar image.  The 1990s saw a lot of work on the text of &#34;Beowulf,&#34; driven in part by new technologies, which allowed a re-examination of the unique manuscript. A cluster of new text editions followed. Greenfield's work is based largely on the then-standard editions of Friedrich Klaeber (1936, with supplements 1941, 1950) and C.L. Wrenn (second edition 1958, revised by Michael Bolton, 1973). However, I have yet to see really dramatic changes in readings that would be critical on the level of verse translations, so for most purposes, especially including reading for pleasure, this remains a soundly based piece of work. I happen to agree theoretically with arguments for prose translations; but this is one of the examples that shakes the theory.  The Introduction is by Alain Renoir (Professor of English at Berkeley; and, yes, part of *the* Renoir family; he is author of a famous article on cinematic effects in &#34;Beowulf&#34;), and combines a general introduction to &#34;Beowulf&#34; and its poetry with a discussion of the present translation. He gives a very good overview of the heroic ethos of the Old English poem, its mixture of feuds and selflessness, success and failure; and of the displacement in the main narrative from human conflicts to struggles with a variety of monsters. (Which are at the same time somehow nearly human, or driven by their response to humans; this is not a simple-minded adventure story.)  There are half a dozen full-page illustrations, and a few page decorations, all quite attractive, by Sarah Higley (whose name I found in the Preface; Southern Illinois University Press seems to have missed including it any of the usual places.)  (I should point out that, while Stanley B. Greenfield [1922-1987] is identified in the book, correctly, as Professor of English at the University of Oregon, he was a Visiting Professor at UCLA when I took courses in Old English there. He handled the introductory course, and later the &#34;Beowulf&#34; seminar. That I actually learned quite a bit of Old English may be a tribute to his teaching ability; that I have retained much less than I hoped is my problem. I mention this fact to be fair, since I might be thought to have a bias in his favor, and in favor of this translation, which he was working on at the time. And, come to think of it, Alain Renoir spoke at UCLA, and I had a brief conversation with him... . Well, Old English wasn't the most crowded academic field.)	2005-01-02
US	30081986	R1FF231EYZBIGQ	0521477352	733825607	The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature (Canto)	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on A Professional Life Distilled	\\"The Discarded Image\\" first appeared in print in 1964, the year following Lewis' death. It first appeared in paperback in 1967, and my copy of that edition is heavily marked up and falling to pieces after years of use, in High School and as an undergraduate and graduate student. It is safe to conclude that I am an admirer of the book. (Also of Lewis' fiction, and his other works of criticism; with a few exceptions, the books on Christianity which made him widely known are of little interest to me.)    It contains the substance (and presumably the final wording) of Lewis' lecture series introducing medieval and Renaissance literature at Oxford, and, presumably, reflects what he taught his students at Oxford, and, at end of his life, was trying to establish at Cambridge. It is admirably concise, remarkably clear, and, for anyone who does not remember that it is described as only an introduction, at times frustratingly limited. In a very few pages he encapsulates some of the main features of European thought between, roughly, the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the publication of  \\"Paradise Lost\\". It represents the essence of a lifetime of actually reading the literature, and he is able to illustrate his points with convincing, and sometimes rather obscure, examples.    On the basis of my own experience, \\"The Discarded Image\\" is helpful not only in understanding the literature of the Christian West during the Middle Ages, but also a lot of Jewish and  (to a somewhat lesser extent) Islamic literature from the same period. Ptolemy and Aristotle, at least, seem to have been everywhere.    In this context, it is perhaps fair to warn potential readers coming to the book directly from Lewis-the-Christian that he displays throughout a remarkable sympathy for a variety of views (pagan, Neo-Platonic, medieval Catholic, and so forth) which they may find disturbing. Education, not edification, is his primary focus. (Of course, there are those who refuse to consider Lewis a real Christian at all, but an agent of the Devil, and possibly even the Pope -- but they probably wouldn't dream of opening this book, anyway.)    To use a catch-phrase introduced to scholarship in 1962 by Thomas Kuhn's \\"Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\\" Lewis is presenting an \\"Old Paradigm\\" of the Universe, the very presuppositions of which have been replaced by a series of \\"New Paradigms\\" during the last four centuries. It describes a vast but finite world of natural hierarchies, in which much that we find commonplace was rare (and vice versa). It is an effort to equip the student to think and perhaps even feel in medieval, not modern, terms. I can think of no one who has so successfully evoked the sensation of living in a Ptolemaic or Aristotelian cosmos.    By the time this book appeared, Lewis' well-earned reputation as a Christian apologist had largely overtaken his status as a prominent critic of medieval and renaissance literature (established by \\"The Allegory of Love\\" in the 1930s). Although \\"The Discarded Image\\" has generally been in print (about a dozen paperback printings between 1967 and the 1994 \\"Canto\\" edition in slightly larger format, and almost as many since), it never seems to have attained the prominence some (myself included) think it deserves. Even Norman Cantor's praise for the book in \\"Inventing the Middle Ages\\" is moderated by complaints about what it doesn't contain, and the dispatch-like brevity imposed by its origin.    It is nice to think that the present \\"Canto\\" edition represents a determination to keep the book available. And the cover illustration of this edition (from an illuminated manuscript of \\"The Romance of the Rose,\\" one of the key works of the High Middle Ages) is certainly more attractive than the blue, with red and white lettering, chosen for the original edition and Cambridge paperback.    It was always an attractively written book, and, literally, memorable; perhaps a little too much. With reference to an observation by another reviewer: I can sympathize with anyone found quoting \\"The Discarded Image\\" without attribution. After numerous readings, I have sometimes found it hard to remember just where an idea, or even a turn of phrase, came from, only to recognize it there while looking for something else.

Despite suggestions on the Amazon page that this version by Charles Kennedy is a new, or at least recent, translation, it is not one of the latest, by a good sixty years.    I've also worked through the whole poem in Old English (Anglo-Saxon). A whole new level of experience; it was worth the effort. I could see why it is a tough work to translate, and I can understand why many want to try their hand at doing better.    The language, on the level of words and phrases, is intensely poetic, and includes terms that Modern English really should have kept, but didn't.  On top of the unfamiliar grammar, the sentence structures are odd for modern readers -- they were meant, instead, for listeners. Something gets lost at every turn, and yet the feeling persists that it ought to be possible to reproduce it in a language which is, after all, a descendant of the poet's. Frankly, I don't think anyone can; but many of the efforts still accomplish something worthwhile. Kennedy's version I count among those that have accomplished a good deal, despite some self-imposed obstacles.    In theory, I favor prose translation of \\"Beowulf.\\" Trying to keep to the line structures and other formal features is just too likely to get in the way of the meaning. And many moderns have trouble reading verse, anyway. Tolkien even gave some justifications for the practice, in an introduction to the Clark-Hall prose translation; and there can't have been too many readers of the poem both as competent in Old English and with such credentials as a creative writer.    But Charles W. Kennedy's version, published in 1940, which I first read in High School, when it was already almost three decades old, remains one of my favorites, despite being in an imitation of the alliterative verse of the original. Re-reading it several times, at intervals of up to tenyears, with vastly greater knowledge of the original, I found that it still impressed me as much as the first time through.    Theory of translation is all very well; but the practice, the actual translator's accomplishment, is what counts. I was carried away by the sense of reading an archaic, but not too distant, poem. If you have read a translation (or even more than one) in blank verse, free verse, rhymed verse, or prose, you may find this translation an eye-opener.    And Kennedy also did very readable verse translations of Christian narrative and lyric verse, and  of some of the other secular poetry; see his \\"Early English Christian Poetry\\" (1952), and \\"Old English Elegies\\" (1936; a more convenient edition of these latter is his \\"An Anthology of Old English Poetry,\\" from 1960, which includes excerpts from the other two volumes as well).    Being based on Klaeber's classic edition (1922; extensively revised for the 1936 version), the textual foundation of Kennedy's \\"Beowulf\\" is a bit antiquated, especially by renewed work on the actual manuscript in the 1990s. But it was never intended to be a literal crib. (And if you try to use any verse translation as such, well, that's your problem.) The language is both noble and fluent. The differences between what Kennedy had before him in his working text and that in a recent edition will rarely make a decisive difference for an ordinary reader.     (Other very good attempts at this difficult feat of recreating alliterative measures -- which involve far more than initial sounds of words -- are Stanley B. Greenfield's 1982 \\"A Readable Beowulf\\" and Ruth P.M. Lehmann's 1988 \\"Beowulf: An Imitative Translation.\\" Both of which also suffer a bit on the textual side, in the light of more recent work. Either might be acceptable to those who find Kennedy's language a little remote and formal.)    Kennedy's introduction was extremely up-to-date, reflecting work of the 1920s and 1930s; an early reference to Tolkien's 1936 lectureon \\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\\" was not only current, but put Kennedy fairly solidly on the \\"modern\\" literary-critical side, instead of with the antiquarian or mythological schools which valued the poem for what they could excavate from it. The subtitle of \\"The Oldest English Epic\\" wasn't exactly in line with Tolkien's approach; but it is hard to imagine even Oxford University Press agreeing to \\"An Old English Heroic-Elegiac Poem.\\"    The introduction covers the usual ground; historical and supernatural elements, the use of digressions to highlight themes of honor, valor, and treachery. The Sutton Hoo ship-burial was too recent a discovery (1939) for inclusion. Some then-recent proposals of sources or parallels in the \\"Aeneid\\" come in for more attention than would later have been the case. But Kennedy is as much interested in comparing literary technique as in source-hunting, and the discussion remains interesting. However inconclusive, it is a comparison of real texts, not theoretical \\"Heroic Lays\\" which *should* have existed, and *would* have been better than what we have.    Kennedy's \\"Beowulf\\" has been reprinted in various anthologies over the years. Not long after first reading it, I found it, excerpted, in my High School English Lit. textbook. Obviously, I think was a good choice for the purpose, and keeping it available in such a form is good. But it is even better taken whole, as Kennedy first offered it.    So having it in print in paperback is great. (I eventually found a hardcover copy for myself, just about a year before the present Galaxy Book edition was released, in 1978.) And I hope that paperbacks of \\"Early English Christian Poetry\\" and the \\"Anthology of Old English Poetry\\" are re-issued someday. (If nothing else, they have less competition, even if the demand for their contents isn't nearly as high.)	2004-12-31

It opens with a superb introductory discussion, which is effectively a short book in itself, and probably could have stood alone with some expansion. (But then we wouldn't have the full texts and their translations.)    Taken as a whole, it fills a void in \\"Beowulf\\" studies. Since it took a long time to fill, I am relieved to report that it was worth the wait. And the comparatively reasonable price of the paperback edition -- reasonable given that is on Old English literature, a subject of limited interest, and published by a University press -- is more good news.    In addition, the volume is of some importance to the growing interest in medieval ideas about strange people, creatures, and places, and the part they played in concepts about the physical world, and what they revealed about the Will of God. And it contributes to other branchs of medieval studies, as well; even to our knowledge of the image of Alexander the Great. (Yes indeed, the Middle Ages had the equivalent of a \\"Hollywood Version\\" ... .)    So, what exactly does it contain, and why is it important? The monsters in the \\"Beowulf\\" manuscript would be just Grendel, Grendel's Mother, and the Dragon, and maybe some of the sea-creatures Beowulf fought, right? Actually, no.    \\"Beowulf\\" survives in a unique eleventh-century manuscript, officially designated Cotton Vitellius A.xv. That means that the seventeenth-century collector Sir Robert Cotton kept it on the top shelf of a bookcase marked with a bust of the Emperor Vitellius, and that it was item number fifteen on that shelf, after he had it bound with a group of four unrelated (except for being English) texts from the twelfth century. The original, shorter, form is known, after the earlier collector who wrote his name on the first surviving leaf, as the NowellCodex.    It was recognized by scholars fairly early on that the original codex contained five works. (Any others were lost, with parts of two of the survivors, before it was rebound, in addition to the damage sustained in an eighteenth-century fire.) These five are: \\"The Passion of St. Christopher,\\" an account of a legendary giant  / Christian holy man; \\"The Wonders of the East\\" and \\"The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle,\\" translations of two Latin accounts of strange creatures encountered in the Orient by Alexander the Great; and, following \\"Beowulf\\" itself, \\"Judith,\\" an Old English verse adaptation of a story from the Apocrypha in the Vulgate Bible, unfortunately incomplete. (For those unfamiliar with the story, it features a heroine who has to deal with a heathen invader, whose behavior, at least, is monstrous. Like David -- or Beowulf -- she comes back with a trophy to prove her story.)    \\"Beowulf\\" has been receiving attention for almost two centuries now; \\"Judith\\" came to scholars' attention even earlier, in a collection of Anglo-Saxon Biblical translations and paraphrases, edited by Edward Thwaite, and published way back in 1698.    But the prose texts, Christian (but not Biblical) or semi-classical, instead of Germanic, have been treated as embarrassing stepchildren (if not worse); although some received individual editions, drawing on other manuscripts when possible, their main treatment *as a group* was a barely-usable volume from the Early Texts Society, edited by Stanley Rypins, \\"Three Old English Prose Texts\\" (EETS Original Series No. 161, 1924). It was published about a dozen years before Tolkien insisted on putting the monsters in \\"Beowulf\\" at the center of the study of the poem. (And when I say barely-usable, I mean that I tried hard to work with it. Rypins seemed very good at reporting the state of some texts which appear to have confused the scribes who had copied them. Yes, it was *supposed* to be a \\"diplomatic edition\\" -- but some diplomatic editions offer more help than others.) Orchard elsewhere described it as \\"less than satisfactory.\\"    It was almost thirty years after Rypins' edition before Kenneth Sisam published the observation that the Nowell Codex seems to have been a collection of stories about monsters and heroes, and that the selection of texts may not have been random, but represented how \\"Beowulf\\" was seen in the late tenth or early eleventh century. And that this possibility deserved attention from critics.    The sort of thing that only a genius of Aristotelian proportions -- or possibly a child -- would think to mention. Completely obvious, naturally, *once* it has been brought to your attention.    Critical consideration of the issue soon followed; although the source materials remained hard to find, with editions scattered, and often imperfectly edited for use in Beowulfian studies. The fact that these were translations from Latin texts with their own confusing histories only compounded the problem.    In the meantime, it had been noticed long before that Beowulf's own King Hygelac appeared, in a garbled form, in a Latin collection, the \\"Liber Monstrorum.\\" (Yes, Harry Potter fans, an actual \\"Book of Monsters.\\") This work, in its turn, seemed to have its own, complex, relationship with the Alexander-texts in the Nowell Codex. And, after Sisam's observation, its separate circulation suggested that the Nowell Codex would not have been a unique example of interest in strange and bizarre (or just very large) inhabitants of lands far and near.    And the \\"Wonders of the East\\" itself turns out to have a complicated history, the original version apparently having been presented to medieval readers as a communication to a Roman Emperor, Hadrian or Trajan, and not originally part of the Alexander Cycle at all, although dependent on it. But it had been drawn in (or drawn back in); what, if anything, did that say about the role of Alexander in medieval thought?    And there are lots of other questions. But systematic treatments of what the texts meant for Anglo-Saxons, especially the versions in their own language, have been frustratingly hard to find. (That something interesting was going on was evident. \\"Wonders\\" contains examples of the word *waelcyrige* -- now familiar in the Norse-derived form of \\"valkyries\\" [valkyrjar]  -- in actual use by an Anglo-Saxon scribe, even if the referents are semi-classical, not Germanic.)    As studies and translations of individual texts have appeared over the years, some information has become available to the \\"common reader.\\" The Old English \\"Wonders of the East\\" is translated in Michael Swanton's \\"Anglo-Saxon Prose.\\" Latin versions of \\"Wonders\\" and \\"The Letter of Alexander\\" are translated, with much else, in Richard Stoneman's \\"Legends of Alexander the Great.\\" (Both books were published in the Everyman series, and both, apparently, are out of print. Stoneman's translation of \\"The Greek Alexander Romance,\\" a more distantly related work, is still available from Penguin, as is Ken Dowden's version of it in B.P. Reardon's \\"Collected Ancient Greek Novels.\\")     In \\"Pride and Prodigies\\" Andy Orchard has brought together critically edited Latin and Old English texts of \\"The Wonders of the East\\" and \\"The Letter of Alexander,\\" with modern English translations of the Old English, and a Latin text, with translation, of the \\"Liber Monstrorum.\\" In the substantial introductory section, Orchard considers how the Old English versions are adaptations of the Latin sources, and the possible relationship of these adaptations to the ideas at work in \\"Beowulf,\\" and whether this sheds any light on well-known parallel incidents in Icelandic literature. The \\"Liber Monstrorum,\\" a sort of grab-bag of anecdotes from a great variety of sources, many classical, is sorted through for similar insights. Connections are made with continental literatures, and Celtic (mainly Irish) traditions, as well. This is very good, if perhaps a little over-rich forsome readers. (I thought I knew the material reasonably well, but I went to my shelves for saga translations, and \\"Beowulf and Its Analogues\\" -- it turned out that Orchard was, of course, much, much more reliable than my memories, but I wasn't wasting my time.)    \\"The Passion of St. Christopher\\" is part of a tradition of \\"Lives of the Saints,\\" and offers a different set of problems, and, understandably, the text is not included in an already well-stuffed volume; and the discussion of it is subordinated to the other works. But a text, translation, and study of this work, as part of the \\"Lives\\" literature, the Christopher tradition, and in terms of beliefs about monsters, also would be welcome.	2004-12-31

Klaeber's \\"Beowulf and The Fight at Finnsburg: Third Edition, with Supplement\\" -- no matter how much Amazon seem to garble the title. As indicated in the review, this now over half a century old. It now has been supplanted (if not entirely replaced) by \\"Klaeber's Beowulf: Fourth Edition,\\" edited by R.D. Fulk, Robert E. Bjork, and John D. Niles (University of Toronto Press, 2008), an impressive work in its own right. It is also possible to find Klaeber's antiquated, but still useful, Bibliography on-line; Fulk et al. made no attempt to match Klaeber's inclusiveness, given the enormous growth of the secondary literature in the second half of the twentieth century, but refer the reader to various more-or-less comprehensive print and on-line bibliographies.]    Except for what seems to be a bright red and gold cover, instead of the brown-on-brown with which I am familiar, the Houghton Mifflin printings seem identical to the D.C. Heath edition of 1950, which added a new layer of supplements to the 1941 supplements of the 1936 revision of a work originally published in 1922, and first revised in 1928. It is in many ways THE edition in English of the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) poem of monsters, heroes, feuds, and wars in a pagan Scandinavia imagined in Christian England.    Despite also being in many ways very antiquated -- essentially a summing-up of the first century of Beowulf-studies -- Friedrich Klaeber's edition is still a model, a monument against which other editions can be measured. Almost two hundred pages of front-matter (not included in the Amazon description) cover essential facts about the manuscript, the language, the meter, and possible historical elements, and, rather reluctantly, the \\"supernatural\\"; followed by a carefully categorized bibliography. (A formidable project even today, and it was carried out in the age of manual typewriters and file-cards.) Klaeber's discussion assumes a basic knowledge of Old English; which, for those who may think of Shakespeare or the King James Bible as being in \\"old English,\\" refers to a form of the language which looks a whole lot more like German than anything you are used to.    The text of \\"Beowulf,\\" meticulously edited, with diacritical marks and punctuation, follows; this is now outdated, particularly by the 1990s \\"Electronic Beowulf\\" project, which recovered manuscript readings lost to view since a nineteenth-century conservation effort, but is still worth close attention. Klaeber was an acute assessor of the available evidence. A valuable Commentary follows the text, offering interpretations, and explaining Klaeber's decisions.    The related \\"Fight at Finnsburg\\" fragment is given a similar treatment, smaller in proportion to its brevity. (Tolkien's posthumously-published \\"Finn and Hengest,\\" edited by Alan Bliss, brings together the fragment and the related digresssion in \\"Beowulf,\\" with even more detailed commentary, and, in my opinion, a very plausible interpretation.)    Appendices supply some parallel texts, references on \\"Antiquities\\" (what would now be called archeology, and sociological speculation), a discussion of grammatical and metrical issues related to textual problems, and the texts of several related shorter poems: the fragments of the lost epic \\"Waldere,\\" the lyric \\"Deor,\\" excerpts from the catalogue of hero-stories in \\"Widsith, and the Old High German \\"Hildebrandslied\\" (the actual extant example of continental German heroic poetry). These are convenient, although mainly for following Klaeber's cross-references.    There follow splendid glossaries for Beowulf and the Finnsburg Fragment, which amount in themselves to grammatical commentaries and something close to a concordance, listing appearances in the text. Nothing quite like them exists, although modern lexicographic and concordance projects are replacing them on an even larger scale; the whole of Old English verse. Finally, there are the Supplements, including further emendations to the texts, and additional bibliography.    As Tolkien noted in \\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\\" (1936), the only thing missing is the poetry. That is something you will have to appreciate on your own -- or at least without Klaeber's guidance. But the modern reading of the poem AS a poem is built on the labors Klaeber codified and made available in English. A whole body of work has emerged since 1936, with Tolkien leading the way; except for some generous acknowledgments in the Supplements, Klaeber came too early to make use of any of it.    Klaeber's edition served students (like me) and scholars well for most of the twentieth century. It still deserves a place on the shelf of a serious Beowulfian, as it was the point of departure for serious scholarship for seventy years. Disagreements with Klaeber's text were noteworthy, agreement with his reading a matter of course. True, Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie's \\"Beowulf and Judith\\" in the \\"Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records\\" series (Volume IV, 1953) had more detail on the histories of suggested readings, and digested a decade and a half of additional critical literature. But to make it fully useful, I had to refer to Klaeber constantly -- my copy of ASPR IV still has the penciled cross-references.    In 2002, Andy Orchard's \\"A Critical Companion to Beowulf\\" described Klaeber's editon as still \\"in many ways the most useful and authoritative.\\" As an introduction to the Old English text, however, the combination of age and price now clearly suggest alternatives to Klaeber's work.    George Jack's \\"Beowulf: A Student Edition\\" (1994), at about 250 pages, is the \\"lean and mean\\" version. It has both marginal glosses and a general glossary. I suspect that it works best in a formal course, with supplementary readings. \\"Beowulf: An Edition with Relevant Shorter Texts\\" (1998), edited by Bruce Mitchell and Fred C. Robinson, is the most recent contender to replace Klaeber, and in everything but time-depth of its coverage of Beowulf studies seems a worthy successor, if not quite so comprehensive. It goes head-to-head with the fifth edition of \\"Beowulf: With the Finnesburg Fragment,\\" edited by C.L. Wrenn and Michael Bolton (1997), the earlier versions of which were Klaeber's main competition for a couple of decades.    For the less ambitious, or those with Klaeber (or one of the other scholarly editions) at hand, there are a variety of less technical versions, some offering newer approaches, which I have found useful or enjoyable. Chickering's \\"Beowulf: A Dual-Language Edition\\" (1977) has a readable translation facing the Old English text, and a first-rate commentary dealing largely with literary, rather than linguistic and textual, problems. Although reprintings do not seem to contain corrections of the annoying typographical errors, these are fairly few.    \\"Beowulf: A New Verse Translation: Bilingual Edition,\\" a form of Seamus Heaney's celebrated recent translation, published in 2001, includes the Old English text he worked from (Wrenn and Bolton, 1988). Although not the very latest treatment of the Old English, it is more up-to-date than Chickering's. The translation is impressive as literature; less so as a close reading of the original.    And Penguin Classics includes an Old English text of \\"Beowulf,\\" edited by Michael Alexander (1995) -- not to be confused with his verse translation for the same publisher -- which I have reviewed separately; this had the use of Jack's text, among others. It has facing-page line-by-line glosses (more extensive than in Jack's edition), instead of a continuous translation, or a dictionary-style glossary; an interesting experiment.    [Additional Note, February 2015: J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary\\" (2014), edited by Christopher Tolkien, can be read, in part, as a response to Klaeber's first and second editions, and probably to the third edition as well, since Klaeber's work was the latest word when Tolkien was drafting his translation of the poem, and was a standard reference during the years in which he lectured on \\"Beowulf\\" at Oxford.]	2004-12-30
US	30081986	RXWAA39GD493	0029344506	280891910	The Religion of China	Books	5	36	37	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on A Classic Civilization, A Classic Study	\\"The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism\\" (original Free Press edition 1951) is one of a number of works by the German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) published in English translation only long after his death, during a post-World-War II boom in Anglo-American interest in his writing. Such interest has recurred at irregular intervals since (one marked by this 1968 paperback reprinting), and Weber's major works, including technical and methodological studies, apparently have all been translated. Initially familiar to readers of English only for his theories on the relation between the Protestant (mainly Calvinist) world-view and the capitalist \\"rationalization\\" of economic life (\\"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\\"), Weber gradually has been revealed as an explorer of the nature of human societies in many times and places.<br /><br />Sinologists have given his studies of China (here and in a few essays published elsewhere) a somewhat mixed reception. On the one hand, it was an important example of China being taken seriously as major civilization, illustrating basic trends in human social behavior, instead of an exotic footnote (\\"Oriental Despotism,\\" \\"The Oriental Mode of Production\\"). A product of Bismarck's Germany, Weber was acutely aware of the effects of bureaucracy, centralization of authority, and economic rationalization on traditional societies, and used China as a test case for his general theories. The religious responses to China's social and political order are a main, but not the only focus, and his treatment of both Confucianism and (mainly philosophical) Taoism as embodying genuine religious experiences was then unusual. Weber's mastery of the available translations and secondary literature is often mentioned as amounting to nearly a professional command of the field.<br /><br />On the other hand, Weber *was* unable to consult the primary sources directly. He was acutely aware that much of his information came from missionaries with ideological biases; according to some, however, he often chose the *wrong* missionary to believe. He seriously underestimated the antiquity of some developments in Chinese government. His examples are sometimes wrong, sometimes not especially pertinent; and better ones are missing because he had no access to them. He accepted the view of Confucius as a sort of learned academic with an interest in ethical government (popular among some modern Chinese as well as westerners), without seeming to notice that he has often been regarded as a supernatural figure, a prophet, or, in Weber's own terms, a \\"charismatic\\" leader. And the study of Buddhism in China was in its infancy, and its transformative impacts on Confucian and Taoist thought and practice only beginning to be grasped. The study of the very complex history of Taoism *as a religion* is also mostly a more recent development.<br /><br />Bearing these limits in mind, Weber's study remains fascinating. His suggested interpretations of Chinese society have set the terms for much research attempting to confirm or refute his ideas. He was sometimes wrong about both absolute and relative datings, but he recognized many important trends, and successfully framed them in larger contexts.<br /><br />As very much an amateur in Chinese studies (with greater limits than Weber, and not nearly as industrious, but able to benefit from modern scholarship), I have long found the book illuminating; I just try to check it against recent studies. For those who are familiar with Weber only for \\"The Protestant Ethic\\" (and the attendant controversy), this volume, and its companions on \\"Ancient Judaism\\" and \\"The Religions of India,\\" may come as a considerable surprise.<br /><br />Those interested in the sociology of Chinese religion (rather than beliefs and practices) will want to take a look at a book by C.K. Yang, the author of the Introduction to this translation. Yang's \\"Religion in Chinese Society: A Study of Contemporary SocialFunctions of Religion and Some of Their Historical Factors\\" (originally University of California Press, 1961) provides information on Chinese religion in relation to government policies, and community and family structures, with documentation for specific regions. I consider it a complement, not a substitute, for Weber, because several chapters are probably too statistical to make it attractive to many readers. Yang also assumes familiarity with a body of professional sociological thought that Weber was still establishing.

US	30081986	R3E0CG9CUCE9CM	0874714206	514417347	Odes of Pindar: Translated into English Verse by Geoffrey S. Conway	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A New Edition Available	This admirable translation is now more readily available, as an Everyman Library paperback, with a new introduction, headnotes, notes, and glossary, in an edition edited by Richard Stoneman. Stoneman also added a selection of Fragments. Conway's translation appears as he left it in the new edition, although Stoneman from time to time suggests readings he prefers.    (Reposted from my \\"anonymous\\" review of September 14, 2003; the following material is excerpted from my review of Stoneman's expanded and revised edition.)    Pindar (about 518-438 BC) was regarded as THE outstanding poet of his time by the later Greeks, and their Roman admirers, and one of the latest of the nine greatest lyric poets. His time was the period of the Persian Wars. Of the other eight lyric greats, most, like Sappho, were renowned predecessors in previous generations, but two were working at the same time, and competed with him for patrons.    These rivals were Simonides, who lived long enough to celebrate the old aristocracy, the \\"tyrants\\" who often replaced it, and then the new \\"democracy,\\" and his nephew, Bacchylides, who was Pindar's younger contemporary. Simonides is now most often mentioned for something he probably didn't compose, the Thermopylae epitaph, \\"Go! Tell the Spartans... .\\"    Meanwhile, over in Athens, young Aeschylus was a rising star with the new-fangled \\"tragedy.\\"    This ranking, combined with the period in which he lived, makes Pindar a figure of Shakespearean proportions. However, most of the works of this \\"Lyric Age\\" are lost, except for fragments, and we might have been left to wonder about all the fuss over this Pindar, if we had the typical set of quotations and papyrus scraps.    Fortunately, Pindar is to a large extent a great exception. Four \\"books\\" of his collected poems exist, intact (for all practical purposes), or at least pretty much as the Alexandrian scholars who assembled a larger edition had left them. This is the largest body of material from any of the poets of the late Archaic and early Classical periods to survive to modern times, but is not necessarily representative of Pindar's total body of work.    The \\"Odes\\" are songs composed for celebrations in honor of victors in the major Games of ancient Greece (Olympic, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian), and are centered on athletes and wealthy patrons (owners of horses and chariot teams). Even the athletes normally belonged to aristocratic families, which could provide them with the time and coaching to train effectively. Despite the origin of the genre, it only partly and occasionally resembles modern public relations for super-star athletes.    The public, celebratory, and partly secular nature of this part of his \\"collected works\\" may have helped their survival during the Middle Ages, when Byzantine scholars seem to have neglected both public, but too obviously pagan, and more private -- and usually erotic -- genres.    This circumstance may seem to narrow the scope of the songs, but protocol demanded attention to the gods and heroes of the victor's city or family, or to some god or hero who could in some way be appropriately invoked as a comparison. As a result, the Epinician (Victory) Odes are a rich source of divine and heroic mythology -- when it can be teased out of Pindar's rich and frustratingly allusive verses. Pindar, with his displays of metrical virtuosity and sudden shifts of subject, has generally been the despair of translators.    (For those who aren't familiar at all, or just would like a painless way to expand their knowledge -- Mary Renault's novel \\"The Praise Singer\\" portrays the earlier part of this period. It is offered as being remembered by the very old Simonides, who, although Renault glosses over the point, was famous in antiquity for inventing the \\"Art of Memory.\\" The young Pindar isn't present in the story, although Aeschylus gets a walk-on.)    Other recent translations include Frank Nisetich's \\"Victory Odes,\\" (1980), those by C.M. Bowra (\\"Odes,\\" 1969, a Penguin Classic, apparently currently back in print), and Richmond Lattimore's \\"Odes\\" (1947, second edition, 1976; a Phoenix paperback, but currently treated by Amazon as an edition of Bowra's Penguin Classic!). Whether it surpasses them in accuracy may be left to classical scholars; the question of readability lies with the individual reader. As I have noted in my reviews of the latter two translations, Bowra attempts to set the \\"Odes\\" in their chronological order, which complicates tracking references, while Lattimore may be clearer at times than the Greek really allows. Any good translation of Pindar is not going to be easy reading; he left simplicity to others.    There is also a two-volume bilingual edition in the Loeb Classical Library, edited and translated by W.H. Race, which includes even the smallest fragments.	2004-12-30

Despite this, he managed to produce a first-rate analysis of the social foundations of Biblical Israel. Not &#34;Judaism,&#34; the religion of the synagogue, but rather the life of an ancient people of the eastern Mediterranean.  Indeed, the closing chapters, on the post-exilic period and the emergence of Second-Temple Judaism, are the weakest of the book. This is partly because he insisted on applying his theories of the social role of sects to the religion of the whole population of Persian and Hellenistic Judea, instead of treating it as a national religion fracturing into sects under the pressure of foreign occupation. Nor did Weber have time to reconsider his conclusions, or his presuppositions. &#34;Das Antike Judentum&#34; was published as it stood in 1921; the author's death in 1920 having prevented revisions, or the carrrying out of his planned analyses of Psalms and Job, which might have been included (along with related studies of Talmudic Judaism, and early Christianity, and Islam).  Max Weber was one of the founders of modern sociology, and although his reputation has fluctuated over the decades, his ideas and methods remain basic to sociological discourse, and appear frequently in other fields. It is not surprising that Weber's discussions of pre-Exilic Israel and Judah retain their value. Not greatly concerned with the absolute or relative dating of the texts, he studied them for what they revealed about economic conditions and social roles. A great familiarity with other pre-modern societies replaced Semitic philology or Christian theologyas his guides. His brief analysis of the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee as means of maintaining social equilibrium, and with it the population of free peasants to fill the militia, was based on his knowledge of ancient Greece, but has since found some confirmation in the concerns of early Babylonian rulers to prevent the impoverishment of the military class.  Besides its continuing value as a study of the Biblical period, Weber's &#34;Ancient Judaism&#34; is a particularly good example of his sociological method in action. The source material is readily available to the student, if not already familiar. In this it is unlike his fascinating studies of China and India, in which he not only drew on translations and secondary sources, but on materials not likely to be familiar to most readers, and in some cases rather difficult to obtain. (Nineteenth-century Indology and Sinology not having a large place in most libraries, for example.) It is therefore much easier to pick up what he left out, what he considered significant, and to decide whether his conclusions now seem warranted by the evidence.

US	30081986	RRC9EMBG9UPHI	0140433775	694073899	Beowulf: Old English Edition (PENGUIN ENGLISH POETS)	Books	5	23	23	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: The Text Edition, Not the Audio	Amazon has linked, as equivalent editions, and for reviews, two entirely distinct products. One is a recording of David Rintoul reading a translation of \\"Beowulf\\" into modern English -- presumably Michael Alexander's \\"Beowulf: A Verse Translation\\" in the Penguin Classics series. It has been linked to a separate volume in the Penguin Classics series, Michael Alexander's *edition* of the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) *text* of the early medieval poem. (I won't be more specific; pick a date after about 750 and before about 1020, you'll find a backer.)    Since Old English is a language about as different from Modern English as the latter is from, say, German, you are going to have to be careful to figure out exactly which item the reviewers are talking about -- if they get that specific.  Detailed appreciations of \\"Beowulf\\" do not constitute, to my mind, a review of any particular edition, translation, or recorded reading. (Even when I agree with them; a great poem.)    Michael Alexander's text edition offers something unusual, in both the Penguin Classics series and among \\"Beowulf editions.\\" It is conservatively edited -- that is, it uses consensus readings from recent critical and student editions, with no original departures in the way of conjectural emendations, etc. But instead of either a dictionary-style glossary OR a facing translation, he offers word by word glosses to each line on the page facing the Old English text. The words there are not given in the inflected or conjugated forms in which they appear in the text, but as a dictionary-style head-words. For example, in line 1590, the word \\"becearf\\" is identified by the infinitive, \\"beceorfan,\\" meaning \\"cut off.\\"    This is actually quite convenient for a student working with a basic textbook, more so than a conventional glossary or dictionary; instead of remembering sound-laws to find the base form, *before* looking it up, you can check your recollection against a grammatical table, or, for the some of the odder\\"strong\\" verbs, look it up to identify the type, and then work out the details. (If you haven't studied Old English, or German, trust me; that would mean a lot to you.) Additionally, for fairly long stretches, it is possible to make out a good deal of sense with just the raw vocabulary -- although hardly enough to get a real sense of the poem.    For some passages, Alexander offers footnoted translations of sentences; usually giving his solution to recognized difficulties, where the syntax is exceptionally tangled, or the train of thought depends on ideas obscure to modern readers. Although the main text does not offer information on how Alexander arrived at his readings, or suggest alternatives, there is an eleven-page list of \\"Manuscript Readings' indicating where unintelligible, broken, or missing words have been emended or supplemented.    This is not a substitute for a fuller introductory edition, like George Jack's \\"Beowulf: A Student Edition\\" (1994; one of Alexander's sources, with similar glosses, in this case supplementing a formal glossary). And it certainly doesn't compare to Robinson and Mitchell's more comprehensive \\"Beowulf: An Edition With Relevant Shorter Texts\\" (1998), the successive revisions of Wrenn's text by Michael Bolton (fifth edition, 1997 ) or Friedrich Klaeber's venerable but invaluable \\"Beowulf: and The Fight at Finnsburg\\" (third edition, 1936; with supplements 1941, 1950). But it is not intended to be.    In conjunction with a good textbook on the language, it would make a fine entry into the poem, in place of the very limited excerpts from the 3182-line poem usually given in a \\"Grammar and Reader.\\"    And for those who have studied the poem in the original, it is a pleasant, and easily-handled refresher, without the constant presence of an \\"authoritative\\" voice, as in the bilingual editions of Seamus Heaney's celebrated recent translation (itself rather too literary for this purpose, actually), or Chickering's older \\"Beowulf: A Dual Language Edition.\\"	2004-12-29

It is a meticulous edition, with commentary, of two manuscripts by J.R.R. Tolkien, representing stages of his thought in the years before his British Academy lecture, \\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\\" (1936; published 1937). That short work has been described as being, although not the beginning of \\"Beowulf\\" criticism, the beginning of all *modern* \\"Beowulf\\" criticism. It was a revised and condensed version of a longer work, which had already gone through two drafts, presented here as edited by Michael Drout, as the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Texts (designations apparently beloved by medievalists).    The 1936 lecture is the title piece in the 1984 collection of some of Tolkien's essays, with which this book should NOT be confused, and is found in several anthologies of \\"Beowulf\\" criticism. It is beautifully expressed, and vigorously argued, but, with its compressed references to old disputes, at times a little hard to follow in detail. I found that careful readings of R.W. Chambers' magisterial \\"Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem\\" (1921; third edition, 1953) and use of Fr. Klaeber's great edition (1922, 1928, 1936), both referred to by Tolkien, were very helpful, and worth the time (if not essential!) for any student of the poem anyway. But the critical (or uncritical) consensus Tolkien was attacking long ago faded from the scholarly mind. (It persists in third-hand opinions, often repeated by people who should know better.)     This presentation of the work-in-progress which produced \\"The Monsters and Critics\\" unfolds the reasoning process and critical disputes behind its crisp rhetoric, and reveals beyond any doubt that Tolkien's disclaimer of detailed knowledge of the secondary literature was the typical medieval-style \\"modesty trope\\" some of us suspected anyway. (More than suspected, really, since the 1983 publication of other Tolkien material on \\"Beowulf,\\" edited by Alan Bliss as \\"Finn and Hengest.\\")    Among other issues, the resemblance of Tolkien's reading strategies for \\"Beowulf\\" to the then-emerging \\"New Criticism\\" is explored, and shown to be coincidental -- beyond sharing in the \\"spirit of the age,\\" if one cares to take that approach. (I have actually seen a \\"history of criticism\\" which dismissed \\"Monsters and the Critics\\" as merely applying New Criticism to medieval literature, and offering nothing original -- which suggested, just as a matter of chronology, a lack of qualifications to write such a history.)    There is information, too, on the probable dates and present conditions of the manuscripts, on the emendations and original readings in the sometimes difficult-to-read handwritten pages, and similar matters. And this is tucked away where those who need the information can find it, and those who aren't interested can ignore it. (It might even serve as a student's introduction to physical descriptions of manuscripts, given that Tolkien's text is, mainly, in modern English, and the issues more immediately clear, than in, say, the case of the \\"Beowulf\\" manuscript itself, or of the two texts of Malory -- or the A, B, and C versions of \\"Piers Plowman.\\")    Annotations on the two versions supply identifications, translate quotations in a large number of languages, and generally clarify Tolkien's statements for non-professionals on the one hand, and for scholars seventy or eighty years removed from the intended readership on the other.    There are interesting sidelights. Some appear as Drout traces the origin of Tolkien's metaphors and allegories in the published lecture. The published version has a now-famous image of the poem as a Tower, made of more ancient stones which have attracted attention away from the view of the Sea at the top. The resemblance to passages in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" seemed to suggest he was borrowing an evocative image from his own developing mythology. Michael Drout shows that the passage started as a fable about a rock garden, and provides references to show that it was then the latest fashion in England. Who would have guessed it? Tolkien as landscape gardener, not Tolkien as secondary world-creator! And this doesn't stand alone, although it is the easiest example to describe.    Drout's editing, in my opinion, manages to meet the needs and expectations of two sets of readers -- scholars and students, and curious Tolkien fans -- quite well. A second reading has left me as convinced as the first time through. And I feel qualified to say this, although I am not the ideal reviewer for this book.    That ideal reviewer would be a professional scholar of Old English (Anglo-Saxon) language and literature, who is also fully at home in the history of \\"Beowulf\\" criticism, and at the same time a well-informed fan of J.R.R. Tolkien. In other words, someone very much like the actual editor. There are such people; I am hoping to hear from some of them in the academic journals, whether Medievalist, Germanist, or Tolkienian (!).    I am at best a rough approximation of this ideal reviewer. I had courses in Old English, including a \\"Beowulf\\" seminar, during which I translated a lot of the major poems (and have the notebooks to prove it), and read through much of the major (and some minor) English-language Beowulf studies through the 1970s. As a Tolkien fan, active mainly in the 1970s, I can point to a set of listings in the 1981 Revised Edition of Richard West's \\"Tolkien Criticism: An Annotated Checklist.\\" In a fanzine I then edited, I sometimes managed to wear both hats simultaneously, as with a review of \\"Beowulf: A Dual-Language Edition,\\" by Howell D. Chickering, Jr. Although I haven't kept really current, I have worked my way through Michael Alexander's text edition, with facing-page glosses, for Penguin Classics (1995), and the bi-lingual version (2000) of Seamus Heaney's celebrated translation.    So, for me, getting to see Tolkien's thoughts on the poem in the process of formation was very exciting. And learning precisely which critic or critics he was responding to, was a well-guided tour through unexpected corners of old familiar places. The editor's observations on how Tolkien's thoughts on the work of the Beowulf-poet sometimes reflect his own experiences writing stories and poems that would not appear before the public for years appealed to the fan side. At least the sort of fan who enjoyed the successive volumes of \\"The History of Middle Earth,\\" even while despairing of mastering the mass of new material.	2004-12-28
US	30081986	R2EQ0B1UAMYFS4	0791443965	724159200	The Craft of a Chinese Commentator: Wang Bi on the Laozi (SUNY series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: The First Installment	\\"The Craft of a Chinese Commentator\\" is the first, and probably by far the most accessible, of Rudolf G. Wagner's three volumes on Wang Bi (226-249; Wade-Giles transliteration, Wang Pi), and his commentary on the \\"Laozi,\\" or \\"Daodejing\\" (Wade-Giles, Lao-tzu, Tao Te Ching). The text of the \\"Laozi\\" usually translated by Western Sinologists is the edition known as the \\"Wang Pi text,\\" and three English translations of the \\"Wang Pi Commentary\\" had appeared when this book was published.    Wang Bi, although occasionally dismissed by those who prefer religious readings of the \\"Tao Te Ching\\" as a logic-chopping \\"born metaphysician,\\" is probably by a wide margin the traditional commentator most admired by Western scholars. Unhappily for the serious study of his commentaries, that isn't saying much. An almost Protestant zeal to get at the \\"real meaning\\" of a Chinese Scripture by stripping away layers of what is presumed to be obfuscation has combined with the recognition that many \\"received\\" interpretations were, in fact, politically motivated, to make the whole subject seem of minor importance to serious scholars. (Arthur Waley, although, or because, he was aware of the importance of commentary in the Jewish tradition, explicitly tried to by-pass the Chinese equivalents as much as possible.)    Rudolf Wagner finds it necessary to point out in \\"Craft,\\" that, although the fact was generally ignored, it had already been demonstrated that the \\"Wang Pi text\\" of the \\"Laozi\\" did not match the commentary, and was in fact a much later edition, with several layers of added corruption. And the text of the Commentary itself was not in the best shape either! Demonstrations of these matters, and their solutions, however, is postponed.    One main focus of this book is the investigation of the traditional accounts of the young genius, who, in a very short life, changed the direction of study of both the \\"Laozi\\"and the \\"Yijing\\" (I Ching; or, less familiarly, the \\"Zhouyi,\\" \\"'Changes' of theChou Dynasty\\"). Wagner clears away a good deal of mythologization; and, of even greater value in some ways, deals with what the legend-making process tells us about how Wang Bi was perceived.    We learn how a very young man came into possession of one of the greatest private collections of manuscripts in all of China, a matter of great importance when the Imperial libraries were destroyed in an age of upheaval; how being a provincial nobody probably saved his life when his more highly placed friends were wiped out in a purge of the \\"Pure Speech\\" movement (sounds very modern); and how his early death was attributed, not to the authorities, but the outraged spirits of the Han commentators he disdained -- and whose works are now lost.    There is also a literary and linguistic side of the study, analyzing Wang Bi's understanding of the stylistic features of classical Chinese which function to some extent as the written language's grammar (a category which some Chinese have been only too glad to follow some Westerners in denying is relevant; a position finally abandoned, although its traces remain in the literature). I found this fascinating, although harder to follow than the biographical and historical material. Presumably a reader who actually knows Chinese, particularly Classical Chinese, would find it less of a strain. Or maybe not; Wagner seems to be challenging some assumptions embedded in how the language is taught.    Wagner's description of what he calls the \\"Interlocking Parallel Style\\" (IPS), and Wang Bi's use of it as a reading technique, and in his own exposition, seemed to me to be convincing. Of course, I at first associated the term Parallel Style with ancient western poetries (Biblical Hebrew, Old English, and others), and not all the connections I was making were helpful to following the argument. Wagner's translation of Wang Bi should make it clearer whether this concept is as useful as it seems to be in examples provided here. (To anticipate a comment below, for whateve it is worth, I think it does.)    The actual substance of Wang Bi's \\"Laozi\\" commentary, and his philosophy, are given only a cursory treatment in \\"Craft,\\" for the very good reason that they are the subject of two later books, then already being prepared for publication. One of these, \\"Language, Ontology, and Political Philosophy in China: Wang Bi's Scholarly Exploration of the Dark (Xuanxue),\\" I have yet to try reading.    I am working my way, slowly, through Wagner's \\"A Chinese Reading of the 'Daodejing': Wang Bi's Commentary on the 'Laozi' with Critical Text and Translation,\\" which establishes a critical text of two works (one long thought lost) by Wang Bi, with translation and commentary, and a reconstruction of the Laozi text he was using, based on other Chinese editions, and the ancient manuscripts excavated at Mawangdui and Guodian, the former of which, in particular, seemingly have a common ancestor with Wang Bi's preferred text, although not identical to it. So far, the Interlocking Parallel Style approach does seem to clarify the translation, even if Wagner's method of displaying it on the page is at first a little distracting.    I can report, therefore, that \\"The Craft of the Chinese Commentator,\\" although it can stand alone, proves to be the essential introduction to this larger, and much more technical volume; and I assume it has the same relationship to \\"Language, Ontology, and Political Philosophy.\\"	2004-12-25

The history and bibliography are a little tricky. \\"Patterns of Initiation: The Haskell Lectures of 1956\\" were delivered at the University of Chicago by Mircea Eliade, a Romanian exile who had been recruited from the Sorbonne to help build up the University's Comparative Religion department. The lectures were composed in French, Eliade's main second language, and the English translation by Willard Trask was published in 1958, by Harvill Press, London, and Harper & Brothers, New York, as \\"Birth and Rebirth.\\"     A new title, \\"Rites and Symbols of Initiation: The Mysteries of Birth and Rebirth,\\" was introduced with the Harper Torchbook paperback edition of 1965. (The publisher had meanwhile become Harper & Row; and today is included in HarperCollins.) There was a later (1980) Harper College Division reprinting, as well. The most recent edition of the book is under this title is a reprinting with a new Foreword by Michael Meade, by Spring Publications (I have previously reviewed that edition; a slightly modified version is offered here, so you need not look for it.)    Meanwhile, a rather different French edition (\\"a rehandling of the material\\") had been published as \\"Naissances mystiques. Essai sur quelques types d'initiation\\" (Paris, 1959).    That makes three versions and four titles, if you've lost count. Plus the different imprints of the English-language version.    Eliade (1907-1986) remained connected to the University of Chicago for pretty much the rest of his life. Although from an institutional point of view he wasn't quite the well-organized driving force that had been desired, he continued to produce interesting and exciting work, not all of which has aged equally well. (For a short account of Eliade's life, work, and an evaluation of his place in the twentieth century, see \\"The Politics of Myth: A Study of C.G. Jung, Mircea Eliade, and Joseph Campbell,\\" by Robert S. Ellwood.)     \\"Birth and Rebirth\\" / \\"Rites and Symbols\\" is one of a large number of small works by Eliade which stand alongside such monuments of scholarship as \\"Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy,\\" and \\"Yoga: Immortality and Freedom,\\" and the attempted summation of his views in the three completed volumes of his \\"History of Religious Ideas.\\"     The material it contains makes it something of a companion to \\"Shamanism\\" in particular, giving a more universal context to the initiatory experiences and rituals described there. It deals with ritual responses to \\"changes of status\\" in traditional societies, from the commonly recognized \\"Rites of Passage\\" (as delineated in Arnold van Gennep's classic book of that name), such as Birth, Adult-hood, and Death, to cultural constructs, such entry into secret societies, or the company of Gods and Ancestors.     The original lecture-series title, \\"Patterns of Initiation,\\" is in some ways the best, suggesting at once that Eliade is focusing on recurring themes, rather than unique instances. The more poetic titles, at least of the English-language version, may have been used because a translation of an earlier work had been published already as \\"Patterns in Comparative Religion.\\"     I think that it remains useful, although according to the classicist Fritz Graf it \\"remains as superficial as it is dogmatic\\" (\\"Magic in the Ancient World,\\" page 264, note 15). I would call it, rather, schematic, concise, and sometimes poorly argued. The documentation, although now obviously rather dated, often is more impressive than the slender body of quotations Eliade provides in his survey of a vast number of times and places. There are also some minor problems with the translation; probably inevitably, with the number of languages involved, in Eliade's own mind as well as the source materials he was using.     Since there are no significant changes in the texts of the English-language editions (a new Foreword makes no great difference to Eliade's work), a reasonably-priced hardcover copy, in reasonably good condition, is an attractive option. I'm not about to give up my aging copy of the Harper Torchbook edition, though. And meanwhile, Spring Publications deserves gratitude for bringing the book back into print.	2004-12-09

The time they spent in Oxford while he was the George Eastman Visiting Professor from CalTech (the California Institute of Technology) is the subject of this enchanting little book from 1961. I first read it in High School (longer ago than I like to think). I missed this reprinting, and it seems out of print (again) over here. But I have heard directly from English academics how much they enjoyed the book, and Amazon UK is currently offering a British edition; so it has found a home somewhere.    Muriel Beadle was an acute observer, and her intelligence is obvious. Some of her professed bewilderment at English society seems a bit exaggerated for the sake of the reader. But her points of reference are the Midwest of her childhood, and, later, California suburbia as a faculty wife. Post-War Britain (actually, late 1950s, but still adjusting) offered a very uneasy mix of official egalitarianism and intense class-consciousness, with no clear parallels in her personal experience.    In one set of vignettes, she finds her generalized American accent mistaken for (a) working class and (b) \\"posh\\" and affected, with strong reactions to either assumption. Her difficulty in understanding either working-class or upper-class English likewise ignites suspicion. Her husband's matter-of-fact observation that there were *some* failings in the existing British educational system compared to a comprehensive American High School is assumed to be an endorsement of a new government policy. (His listeners understood it as \\"Comprehensive School\\" ... .)    She has her own comments comparing elementary school systems -- 1940s and 1950s-vintage, and no longer really valid on either end, but very interesting  -- and attitudes toward preventive medicine (she seems obsessive to the English, they seem lax to her).    She finds figuring out colloquial weights and measures (quick, define \\"stone\\" in relation to a quantity of coal) is an unexpected challenge. Her husband and son are surprised that, although she understands the astronomy perfectly well, in the abstract, she hasn't automatically associated latitude with the length of the day. (I've been around enough CalTech people to recognize the not-quite-flattering assumption that you are as brilliant and well-informed as they are, and *should* think as clearly. And these days, the spelling seems to be Caltech, especially on-line; I guess I'm already a fossil.)    Then, as she is beginning to feel at home, her husband learns he is co-winner of  a Nobel Prize (Physiology and Medicine), and everything shifts into high gear. More cultural / geographical disconnects, some seen from the other side, as they visit the continent. \\"Is there much snow in America, Mrs. Beadle?\\" --- quick mental comparison of her childhood winters to recent years in Pasadena (home of the New Year's Day Rose Parade) -- \\"About as much as in Europe.\\" I've never been able to think of a better short answer to that question.    \\"These Ruins are Inhabited\\" has a sequel, two or three times the length: \\"Where Has All the Ivy Gone?: A Memoir of University Life,\\" describing her husband's tenure (1961-1968) as President of the University of Chicago (Doubleday, 1972; reissued by the University of Chicago Press, \\"With a New Epilogue,\\" under the Midway imprint in 1978). The tone there is sometimes graver; being in a policy-making position imposed burdens on her husband, which she shared. Tensions along racial and ethnic divides were now as open as any class-based hostility, and completely beyond a University's control; but the Administration could take the blame from all sides.    But there is a scene in which the newly-arrived President of the University breaks out his mountaineering gear to go to the rescue of a kitten on a roof, attracting police attention ... .	2004-11-27

So Dover Publications has now (2004) reprinted &#34;Teutonic Mythology&#34; under the &#34;Phoenix&#34; imprint, apparently in two formats (bindings). I look at my copies of the previous (1966) Dover paperback edition of James Stallybrass's 1883-1888 translation of Jakob Grimm's &#34;Deutsche Mythologie,&#34; with the four volumes bound in different colors, and I feel terribly old.<br /><br />They were purchased at less than a tenth of the publisher's current asking price (well, one volume was a gift, but I'm looking at the cover prices), and I feel grateful that I bought (three of) them in the early 1970s. At the time, that still seemed a lot of money for paperbacks, even trade paperbacks, but I have had decades of use out of the set, which is still holding up well. (Dover then still used signature-stitched bindings and high-quality paper; their claim that their paperback books would last as well as hardcover editions was well founded. If Dover does reissue them in paperback, they will probably be less durable and, inevitably, more expensive.)<br /><br />[Addendum, August 31, 2017: As I should have noted here years ago, the four volumes of Grimm's &#34;Teutonic Mythology&#34; are available in reliable PDF format from archive.org (the Internet Archive). These are awkward to read (and search) but, assuming you have regular access to a computer or other device capable of handling them, but they are easy to find, and are free. So are copies of Viktor Rydberg's less scholarly, but more poetic, &#34;Teutonic Mythology,&#34; a distinct work confusingly translated from Swedish under the same English title. The three volumes of another nineteenth-century compilation, Benjamin Thorpe's &#34;Northern Mythology,&#34; are also available.]<br /><br />Read with care, and with frequent reference to modern text editions, translations, and studies, the &#34;Teutonic Mythology&#34; is still a mine of information on the religious ideas, customs, and common metaphors and figures of speech (supposed to be fossilized beliefs) of the ancient and early medieval Germanic peoples (the continental Germans, the Dutch and Flemings, the Scandinavians, and the Anglo-Saxons), and much else in medieval literature. Everyone knows the Grimms from the fairy-tale collection, but individually and together they wrote and edited much more.  (For some reason, Jakob Grimm [1785-1863] almost always appears in English as Jacob, but his brother Wilhelm [1786-1859] never seems to become William.)<br /><br />The &#34;Mythology&#34; in particular is constantly cited in the older secondary literature, so it is nice to be able to find such references. On many occasion it has clarified for me an obscure argument carried out by long-dead scholars with page-references to Grimm's then-definitive treatment of the issue (although sometimes I have had to work out the relation of the pagination of an unseen German edition to the English text -- not fun).<br /><br />More important, for my purposes, it was a handy reference for what would have been readily available knowledge in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and the early twentieth. They are very useful indeed, if you are interested in Richard Wagner's versions of Germanic myth and legend, or those of William Morris. Or, particularly since this is a translation, if you want to see what was available to the young E.R. Eddison, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, among many others.<br /><br />(For that specific purpose, the only thing really comparable in scope they might have read was Benjamin Thorpe's three-volume &#34;Northern Mythology&#34; of 1851, which was briefly available in a one-volume omnibus paperback from Wordsworth a few years ago. In terms of information available to its learned author, Thorpe's book, which I have reviewed, was largely a less systematic English Grimm, with more extensive summaries of Norse sources, and some excellent additional evidence from folktales. It is not quite so dated, but mainly becauseit was not so ambitious; whole topics aren't even mentioned, so Thorpe couldn't have made any mistakes about them. For the intellectual and cultural background, Andew Wawn's recent (2000) &#34;The Vikings and the Victorians: Inventing the Old North in 19th-Century Britain&#34; may become the standard reference.)<br /><br />Thomas Shippey in particular has pointed out several places where Tolkien invented Middle-earth &#34;solutions&#34; to passages where Grimm expressed confusion over contradictory data. Tolkien would eventually have gone directly to the German text; Lewis mentions reading Grimm in German, but seems to mean the Fairy Tales (&#34;Kinder- und Hausmaerchen&#34;).<br /><br />In addition, Grimm's appendices (in the fourth volume of the translation) assemble an extraordinary number of important non-literary medieval (and later) texts in one place; genealogies, spells, penitential guides, lists of superstitions, dialect terms. Although as editions they are antiquated, having them in one place proved convenient on a great many occasions. (For example, Valerie Flint's 1991 &#34;The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe&#34; cites later editions of several of them, none readily accessible to me.)<br /><br />Given the present price, although I'm delighted that Dover has brought the whole set back into print simultaneously for the first time in years, I'm not urging everyone interested in Germanic myth and folklore to rush to buy it. (Even with the current -- November 2004 -- Amazon discount.)<br /><br />And not just because of the price. This is a monument of scholarship from the first half of the nineteenth century (1835; second edition 1844); almost everything in it has to be viewed with at least a little suspicion. Grimm already recognized that there were problems. A good part of volume four consists of additions and corrections to the text, which he had hoped to incorporate in a third, and fully revised, edition. (His publisher instead reprinted the three-volume second edition text in 1854, and called it the &#34;Third Edition.&#34; A posthumous editor arranged the notes in order, to be printed as a supplement in a &#34;Fourth Ediiton,&#34; and Stallybrass followed this practice, instead of tampering with the original.)<br /><br />Throw in the expense, and there is reason for suggesting other places to start.

US	30081986	R33NV79J6E0PUJ	0671833723	573674460	Three From The Legion	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Little Creaky, but Fun!	\\"Three From the Legion\\" collects stories from (mainly) an early part of Jack Williamson's long career -- almost as long as American science fiction magazines, and continuing, with a novel, \\"Stonehenge Gate,\\" released in 2005.    Serialized publication in 1934 of \\"The Legion of Space\\" was followed by \\"The Cometeers\\" (1936), and \\"One Against the Legion\\" (1939). These were well received, fondly remembered, and later given then-unusual hardcover editions by Fantasy Press, in somewhat revised forms, \\"Legion\\" in 1948, and \\"The Cometeers\\" in 1950, with the latter  volume including \\"One Against the Legion.\\"    When Pyramid Books repackaged them in mass-market paperbacks in 1967, \\"The Cometeers\\" was sent out on its own, and the new volume \\"One Against the Legion\\" was filled out with a new, shorter, story in the same sequence, \\"Nowhere Near\\" -- in which Williamson just missed being the first to describe a \\"Black Hole\\" in those words. It also marked the Legion's return to interstellar space through its normal means of travel.    (Note that Williamson's 1938 short novel of competing alternate futures, \\"The Legion of Time,\\" also published by Fantasy Press and Pyramid, and reprinted in a large-print format in 2002, is connected only by similarity of title; it is paired with an unrelated time travel story, from 1939, \\"After World's End.\\")    After Pyramid foundered, this omnibus gave the stories a fresh start in 1980; it appeared in hardcover as a Science Fiction Book Club Special for members, and as a Pocket Books mass-market paperback. Despite the title, it contains all four stories. There were also separate printings of the three volumes. Ultimately the older tales were joined by what seems certain to be absolutely the final story in the series, \\"The Queen of the Legion\\" (1983) -- or at least it is the last Williamson would consider writing. At one time there was a game version: \\"The Legion at War.\\"    The flaws in the stories are now obvious -- thin characterization, gender stereotypes, plot devices that, if not already over-used then, are now threadbare. (Well, *someone* had to invent the sexy-but-murderous-androids plot -- unless you count clockwork in E.T.A. Hoffmann!) It may be difficult for some modern readers to grasp just how popular the first two stories in particular were. And how good they remain, taken as fast-moving adventures with some serious implications. Williamson was soon to become a better writer -- or display his talents to better advantage -- but even as my critical training tells me I *should* be objecting to these stories, I keep reading (and re-reading) with pleasure.    \\"The Legion of Space\\" was intended, at least in part, as a career breakthrough, with lasting consequences for the whole series. Williamson, after selling his first stories as a teenager in the earliest days of \\"Amazing\\" magazine (\\"The Metal Man,\\" 1928, and many others), had been studying literature. He felt that he could now write to the standards of the then-prestigious (and better-paying) general fiction magazines which occasionally published science fiction, especially \\"Argosy\\" -- particularly since some of his existing markets, such as the Clayton chain's \\"Astounding,\\" were foundering.    Hearing from his professor that even established novelists borrowed from earlier writers, he based his main heroes on D'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers, and threw in a version of Falstaff for comic relief. He added a little desert-fortress scene-setting from \\"Beau Geste\\" (Mars instead of the Sahara), showed us a hero closely related to a major villain, and introduced him to a beautiful princess -- no, make that the \\"Keeper\\" of a Secret and Ultimate Weapon, and defender of the Republic of the Solar System -- centuries in the future. Naturally, she is promptly kidnapped in an attempt to gain control of the weapon ... .    Still an extremely young man, Williamson had formed a template that is still in use. Don't believe me? Try watching the installments of \\"Star Wars\\" *after* reading \\"Three from the Legion\\"! (There probably will never be a \\"Legion\\" movie; it would look too derivative....)    The basic concept of the Legion itself was largely a re-tread of stories that Edmond Hamilton, E.E. Smith, Williamson himself, and John W. Campbell, Jr. had been writing; a space-borne military or police force defending civilized beings against outlaws, pirates, and marauders from other worlds. (This was Campbell in his first phase; he would re-invent himself as the more sophisticated Don A. Stuart, and finally transform into magazine science fiction's most influential editor. Hamilton too would go one to write in very different styles, besides making major contributions to the DC Universe, many of which are still in use.)    It was easy to grasp, even for those who routinely skipped \\"that crazy Buck Rogers stuff\\" in the funny pages; the U.S. Cavalry or the Mounties, but with spaceships and ray-guns. (For television, once budgets exceeded that of \\"Captain Video,\\" you could add Coast Guard duties, and have the Federation's Star Fleet... .)    Still keeping it simple, apparently with \\"Argosy\\" in mind, Williamson stuck with human heroes, and made all the aliens enemies (although not all of the enemies were aliens). He had already demonstrated his competence with sympathetic non-humans in \\"The Moon Era\\" back in 1932, and regular readers of science fiction might be happy enough to have tentacled spheres or multi-brained dragonoids among the protagonists (see Hamilton and Smith for prime examples). But the \\"mundanes\\" (as science fiction fans would one day call them) had enough trouble with skin colors and accents among their fellow-humans.    Of course, so did Campbell, or some of his mouthpiece heroes; and almost everyone used ethnic stereotypes as a cheap substitute for characterization. (In science fiction, Smith's \\"Spacehounds of IPC\\" and the original version of its sequel, \\"Triplanetary\\" -- later absorbed into the \\"Lensman\\" series --are contemporary examples.) Williamson's not very successful \\"futuristic\\" names for characters in the \\"Legion\\" stories seem a conscious attempt at a world without recognizable -- to us -- ethnic distinctions.    Making this part easy was important, because Williamson was using as back-story what could have been a self-contained plot; a story about survivors of a \\"lost\\" interstellar expedition returning from exploring an unknown, monster-ridden, planet! Ed Hamilton had already turned the same sort of unlucky venture into a stereotype in his early \\"Interstellar Patrol\\" stories, but it would be new and confusing to many \\"Argosy\\" readers.    Instead of doing a new version of the plot, and passing it off as original, Williamson was making those events merely the jump-off point, with the \\"heroic\\" leader's very heroism and loyalty to humanity being called into question in the first installment. That would be novelty enough. (Later, for different reasons, he also used the android-assassin idea for more Legion back-story.)    Although invading monstrosities from the stars, like Lovecraftian extra-dimensional horrors, were not often given specific motivation, Williamson supplied it. Like nineteenth Europeans in Africa (or, later, the Chinese in Tibet), his aliens were in search of extractable natural resources for their economy, and didn't mind what happened to \\"inferior beings\\" which got in the way -- including their collaborators -- let alone the hostile environment in which they were working. This slant on imperialism went back all the way to H.G. Wells (although he was dealing with an attempt at long-term settlement), but many writers already had discarded it in favor of unspecified alien evil-ness.    Unfortunately, no one had told Williamson that \\"Argosy,\\" wanting consistency if not realism, had a policy against stories which changed permanent landmarks; \\"Argosy\\" stories should belong to the same world. A major plot point -- destroying the alien invaders' base on the Moon by using the Keeper's super-weapon against the satellite -- was unacceptable. What if some other writer wanted to use the beautiful full Moon in the night sky, as a scenic background in a love-story set in an even more distant future? So, eventually, it was rejected.    The story finally went to one of Williamson's established markets, a revived version of \\"Astounding,\\" -- possibly past its \\"Astounding Stories of Super-Science\\" phase, but certainly not yet John W. Campbell's more dignified \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" (as he finally persuaded the new owner, Street & Smith, to rename it).    And so only science fiction fans encountered the secret super-weapon AKKA, and got to ponder the usually unmentioned problem that once a \\"secret weapon\\" has been used, there isn't much of a secret left -- only an incentive for a first strike. (However, they, at least, would have recognized the weapon's strange name as an allusion to a story by A. Merritt, Williamson's one-time literary god.)    Williamson returned to this conundrum in the first sequel, \\"The Cometeers,\\" set a generation later, which pointed out in detail that, once such a weapon has been used, and its action reported, a potential enemy with enough intellectual and material resources should be able to duplicate it, instead of just trying to prevent its use.    This now seems painfully elementary, but apparently it wasn't. Suppose the stories had appeared in \\"Argosy\\" and been read by a larger part of the American public, perhaps including political and military leaders. Would so many have unquestioningly accepted the notion that the Atomic Bomb could be maintained as an American monopoly? Just one of history's little mysteries.    As it happens, at least one chemist on the Manhattan Project later claimed to have started thinking about Ultimate Weapons while reading \\"Legion\\" -- flattering, but not exactly what Williamson wanted to hear.    Williamson, meanwhile, discovered that, despite a pretty girl with powers of life and death, and a set of square-jawed, if slightly eccentric, heroes, the show was being stolen by his Falstaff-surrogate, the old, fat, whining, hard-drinking Giles Habibula, the greatest lock-picker in the Solar System. Well, he *says* he's given up a brilliant career in crime for *honorable* service in the Legion, and is the greatest lock*smith* -- Ahh, lad, the pity of it! 'Tis mortal hard!    The bibulous Giles had another key (pardon the expression) role in \\"The Cometeers,\\" and was an important, but still secondary, character in \\"One Against the Legion.\\" He returned in a center-stage role in \\"Nowhere Near.\\" And watch for a remarkably Habibula-like character complaining and shambling his way through \\"Queen of the Legion.\\"    The Legion, unlike Hamilton's earlier Interstellar Patrol, and Smith's Galactic Patrol in the late thirties, remained both entirely human in personnel, and mostly bound to the Solar System. It awaited external threats, but posed none to others. A future society outside the confines of the Legion is hardly sketched in (nothing much about money, except at gambling resorts, for example; we do see that marriage is an existing institution). Williamson does tell us a little about its larger economic and political history, with tycoons seizing power, and provoking resistance. In fact, these provide one of the springboards of the plot of \\"Legion.\\" Not very sophisticated, but remarkable in its day, and still enough, I think, to carry the story.	2004-11-14
US	30081986	R7JRYTFOW2928	0812968255	830723002	Meditations: A New Translation	Books	5	97	107	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: The Modern Library and the Emperor	It was interesting to see that one reviewer went looking for a copy of the Modern Library edition of \\"Meditations\\" as a gift, and had to settle for a different translation.    There was a time when many publishers had in print their own editions -- usually \\"gift editions,\\" in a range of prices -- of the little book, \\"To Himself,\\" by the second-century Roman patrician Marcus Annius Catilius Severus (121-180 C.E.), known after his marriage as Marcus Annius Verus -- almost always titled something like \\"The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,\\" and most commonly some version (little choice disguised as many choices) of George Long's 1862 translation of the Greek original, originally published as \\"The Thoughts of the Emperor M. Aurelius Antoninus.\\"    For Marcus, besides receiving an excellent education in Greek, which he seems to have used as naturally as Latin, went on, through a process of adoption and co-optation, to rule the Roman Empire, beginning in 161 with the death of Antoninus Pius, his uncle, who had adopted him as heir, using a third version of his name. For moderns, he is usually just Marcus Aurelius; I found it a bit of shock to see him as just another \\"Antoninus\\" in ancient texts.    Under any name, he has been popular, at least with publishers; even now, there seem to be something like sixty versions in English of this book available on Amazon, even though many *are* out of print (and most seem to be of the same few older translations). As usual, a number of these editions and translations are grouped by Amazon for review purposes, and I will mention some. If you find this, or someone else's, review of one translation under a different heading, PLEASE remember that, as Marcus Aurelius saw, some things really are beyond our control.    It should require more thought to understand Marcus than it does to follow the English version. The Modern Library's current offering, a new translation by George Hays, is based on modern text editions, and seems to be both an excellent first introduction to the book, and graceful reading for those with no interest in looking further. It has brief but helpful notes, and a glossary of names, which helps keep the notes short and to the point. Some will follow his references to more advanced treatments, including textual as well as philosophical problems.    As for Marcus Aurelius, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest, and certainly the most morally and intellectually impressive, of all Roman Emperors. Gibbon tended to see the Empire's real decline as subsequent to his death, a view not without its reflection in the recent motion picture \\"Gladiator.\\" The transitions by appointment from Trajan to Hadrian to Antoninus Pius to Marcus produced one of the most successful set of reigns in history (if mainly from a strictly Roman and Imperial point of view). It is perhaps the best historically-documented counterpart of the Chinese tradition of the Sage Emperors who chose as heirs the Most Virtuous (or Most Effective) subjects, instead of favored sons.    The policy had precedents in Roman history, although none so successful for so long. Family loyalty was admired, and inheritance gave access to key property, including the slaves in the bureaucracy, and the loyalty of followers (veteran soldiers, freedmen and other clients); yet the whole dynastic principle was suspect as un-Roman. It was in part accidental, Antoninus, for example, himself almost a last-minute substitute, having no son to be his heir. Marcus Aurelius designated his son Commodus as successor, with less fortunate consequences, after the death of his first choice; although Commodus' evil reputation may reflect his political and military failures, and the interests of his successors, as much as his personality.    So one might expect from the great Emperor Marcus Aurelius some manifesto on statesmanship, or imperial strategy, or at least good government. In fact, his twelve books (booklets, really) of little notes \\"to himself\\" contain reflections on fate, on moral lessons from classical literature, on religion, on human nature. They are probably the last thing one would expect of a Supreme Autocrat and Generalissimo.    Nor are they an exposition of a philosophic system; no surprise that some reviewers, apparently expecting one, have found them unsatisfying.    The first three books have titles (some are subscripts in the manuscript tradition, but, like Hays, I think they are misplaced). \\"On the River Gran, Among the Quadi,\\" refers to a campaign on the borders of the empire. If it is the heading of Book Two, the lack of any explicit reference therein to the hard-fought German campaign is worth pondering. Was this what the Emperor considered truly important? What he wanted us to think he thought was important? (But there is internal evidence that he had no intention of making any of it public.) What he preferred to think about when he could get away from the war for a few moments? It should be remembered that he was a successful campaigner.    Hays' clear translation into modern English joins a number of post-Long translations. Older versions include the important version with commentary of A.S.L. Farquharson (Oxford, 1944, out of print; his translation with new introduction, etc., World's Classics, 1990, and Oxford World's Classics, 1998), and two competitors for the student and general reader markets, respectively, by G.M.A. Grube (originally Library of Liberal Arts, Bobbs-Merrill, 1963) and Maxwell Staniforth (Penguin Classics, 1964), which have been in and out of print (but mostly in) for four decades. Of these, I much prefer Hays -- although the additional material in the World's Classics edition(s) is worth a look. (Staniforth, by the way, says that \\"a couple of generations ago\\" major publishers had \\"elegant miniature\\" editions of classics, usually including the \\"Meditations\\" -- those I remember from the 1960s themselves were full-sized, and distinguished only by gilt edges and/orslipcovers and/or presentation pages.)    It also joins the highly-praised contemporary version, \\"The Emperor's Handbook: A New Translation of The Meditations,\\" translated by David Hicks and C. Scott Hicks (2002; not seen).    It competes as well with a fairly recent (1993) Dover Thrift Edition of the George Long translation, revised (and not for the first time) to modernize his mid-Victorian English and untangle his somewhat convoluted fidelity to (a long-obsolete edition of) the Greek. That Long was not very readable was probably not of much concern to those who used to buy and give (and possibly receive) editions designed to suggest educated tastes; certainly not to the sellers. Long's concern for accuracy should be emulated, but turning relatively clear Greek into opaque English doesn't seem the best way to achieve the goal. (In all fairness, what was plain enough language in mid-Victorian England / Civil War America may now seem obscure for other reasons.)    The novelist Mary Renault thought that Marcus' example refuted Lord Acton's view that \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely,\\" but the most remarkable lesson of the \\"Meditations\\" is that Marcus Aurelius did not believe that he HAD absolute power. He had been chosen and groomed for a role he had been taught to accept as a duty, and regarded it as both an obligation and an imposition. For Marcus was a Stoic -- not in the commonplace sense of someone who repressed his feelings or endured pain without expression, but in the original sense of a follower of philosophy that offered a quasi-religious approach to life. Hays usefully points out (with helpful bibliography) that Marcus was, in the manner of his time, eclectic, but grants that, if asked, he would have identified himself with Stocism.    The movement was founded by Zeno of Citium (or Kition), born on Cyprus (about 336 B.C.E.) in a family said to be part Phoenician, who taught in the Stoa Poikile, or \\"Painted Walkway,\\" in Athens, from some point after 313 to his death about 261 B.C.E. It was one of the key movements of Hellenistic times, and found a ready reception among upper class Romans as well. Teaching calm in the face of stress, and endorsing acceptance of public obligations, including religion, it is traditionally paired with, and contrasted to, Epicureanism, which taught avoidance of excessive pain and pleasure, withdrawal into private life, and the pointlessness of traditional religion. (Not hedonism, as popularly imagined; nor did it deny the existence of gods, only that they had any interest in anything so trivial and base as human concerns.)    For those who find the \\"Meditations\\" intriguing but unsatisfying, works by other Stoics may be more fulfilling; there are some excellent recent volumes translating and interpreting Marcus' older contemporary, Epictetus, a slave who set an example to the rulers of the western world -- but that would be another review.	2004-11-10

Not absolutely unique on the level of details, it stands apart when seen as a whole. Although the author's copious and skillful writing in an improbable variety of genres set him apart from the rest of the Anglo-Irish Peerage, he seems to have shared their assumption that a man of his position and rank could do as he pleased, when he pleased. Including what he wanted to write.  As a result, this book won't fit into any neat category, whether it existed then, or emerged later.  The book seems to open with an idealized medieval scene, like one of the late-Victorian medieval romances by William Morris (&#34;The Wood Beyond the World&#34; or &#34;The Well at the World's End&#34;). We meet the old, wise, and patient lord of Erl, and the skilled and industrious people of Erl, ruled by a line that goes back seven hundred years. That takes a couple of paragraphs, and is interwoven with plot developments; despite a reputation for elaborate prose (&#34;iridescent, crystalline, singing,&#34; according to H.P. Lovecraft), Dunsany could really be quite concise.  But, in a moment worthy of Dunsany's American contemporary, James Branch Cabell, at his most mordant, we meet these stolid people as the Parliament of Erl, taking the initiative for the first time in five centuries, asks that the land be ruled by &#34;a magic lord.&#34; And so the current lord, feeling unable to refuse so &#34;reasonable&#34; a request, made after so long an interval, commissions his apparently matter-of-fact son, Alveric, to meet the demand by marrying a princess of Elfland. How to arrange it is Alveric's problem.  And if, indeed, Cabell had been writing the tale, everything after these first two (!) pages would have been about the absurdities of democracy, aristocracy, celebrity, marriage, and anything else that came into sight; a version of &#34;Jurgen&#34; (1919) or &#34;Figures of Earth&#34; (1921). For sources, one would look back with certainty to the quest of an Elf-queen in Chaucer-the-pilgrim's comically inept &#34;Tale of Sir Thopas&#34; in &#34;The Canterbury Tales.&#34;  But instead of Cabell's satire, or Chaucer's, we then get charming word-pictures of the obviously British countryside (England and Ireland both seem to be drawn upon), vignettes of children, and of trolls, and the sensations of dogs -- this being in fact unmistakably the work of the Anglo-Irish Lord Dunsany, travel-writer, essayist, and master of the very short story.  As Alveric tries to cross the forever-shifting borders of Elfland, seeking the Elfin Mountains across the edges of the fields we know, the author might have been anticipating Hope Mirrlees' &#34;Lud-in-the-Mist,&#34; still two years from publication. But the nature of the traffic between Erl and Elfland is rather different than that between Mirrlees' Free State of Dorimare and the Elfin Marches, and looking forward seems no more helpful than looking back.  And, eventually, we come to an extraordinarily detailed account of hunting a unicorn with dogs, using strictly medieval methods  -- for stags, not unicorns. Dunsany was an enthusiastic hunter himself, and, to judge from John Cummins' &#34;The Hound and the Hawk: The Art of Medieval Hunting&#34; (1988), he knew how deer were pursued and taken &#34;par force&#34; by his Anglo-Norman ancestors. It is rather grimly realistic. If you can't tolerate the sort of predator-kills-its-prey scene from which the cameras always pan back on wildlife shows, you may have a problem here. It is an extraordinary accomplishment, although it was years before I realized quite how good, as well as how exciting, it was. (Explanations of the hunting scenes in &#34;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&#34; were the first to prove helpful; Turgenyev and Tolstoy provided parallels, but were too nineteenth-century, as well as Russian, to be secure guides.)  Note to (some) Robert. E. Howard fans: You don't need a well-muscled warrior laying waste to whole armies to have action scenes!  So it should be no surprise that it doesn't seem to fit any established categories. &#34;The King of Elfland's Daughter&#34; is &#34;of its own kind,&#34; *sui generis,* to be enjoyed  -- or not enjoyed -- on its own merits. If not as unique as the Phoenix, it still stands alone, hard to judge from any amount of experience. It is perhaps more easily absorbed by the practiced reader, who recognizes the unexpected as unusual, or even by the totally inexperienced, than by the relative novice looking for genre-based cues in a book that preceded their invention, by a writer who, if he had known the conventions, probably would have ignored them whenever he wanted to.  The 1920s seem to have been a good time for publishing fantasy, but it didn't last. Faced with the then established publishers' and retailers' belief -- or, given some actual sales figures, the superstition -- that &#34;fantasy doesn't sell,&#34; it is not surprising that, like much of Dunsany's production, this book faded from store shelves and the publisher's list, and then from memory, known only to those fortunate enough to lay hands on a copy. Dunsany himself was hardly forgotten, of course -- he continued to publish, almost until his death in 1957. He left an impact on many writers in the first half of the century, some very different from others. H.P. Lovecraft, of course, but also Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp (and not just when they turned Mr. Jorkens' club into Gavagan's Bar); and Fritz Leiber, who would have been particularly interested in Dunsany the playwright. And he would do so again; but it would take awhile.  Then Bob Pepper presented the unicorn hunt as dark stained-glass for the front side of the wraparound cover of the June 1969 Ballantine Adult Fantasy edition, catching much of the action without the blood. (The series logo, by the way, was &#34;The Unicorn's Head&#34;!) That mass-market paperback of &#34;The King of Elfland's Daughter,&#34; with a typically enthusiastic, but not terribly informative, introduction by Lin Carter, presented the book to a whole new set of readers (myself among them). Many of us wondered where it had been all our lives. Out of print for forty years! Another demonstration that the physically inaccessible will be obscure, without regard to any real merits.  It was reprinted in that format in 1973, and had a third printing, without the introduction, and with a new cover by Darrell Sweet, as a Ballantine Fantasy in January 1977. (It was part of the transition, completed in March, to the Del Rey imprint, Ballantine Books having been acquired by Random House; so no &#34;Adult&#34; in the label, and the new &#34;Basilisk's Crest&#34; insignia appeared in place of any of the versions of the &#34;Unicorn's Head.&#34;) This seems to have been the last American-based edition for about twenty years, although there was at least one British-based trade-paperback edition, in 1982. (I say &#34;based&#34; because there seems to have been international distribution of both.)  The Ballantine mass-market edition, with the substitution / addition of a new introduction, was eventually the basis of the &#34;Del Rey Impact&#34; trade paperback of 1999 (and its &#34;library binding&#34; counterpart), and this of the &#34;Gollancz Fantasy Masterworks&#34; edition (UK) in 2001, both with an introduction by Neil Gaiman, and cover art from John William Waterhouse's vaguely relevant &#34;La Belle Dame Sans Merci&#34; of 1893 (illustrating the Keats poem, in the Pre-Raphaelite mode). The Gollancz edition differs visibly in the absence of the bands at the top and bottom of the cover.  These forms of the text, at 242 pages besides varying front matter, seem distinct from the 282-page Unwin Paperbacks trade edition, with a cover by Kathy Wyatt, published in 1982. Although I have not noticed any textual differences, it may, being re-set, go back independently to the original G.P. Putnam printing (301 pages); or to a reported 1972 British edition (Tom Stacey, London), which I have not seen.  Not a lot of editions and printings, but the book has been kept alive, despite some gaps in availability. And, given the corrupt (or, frankly, butchered) condition of some fantasy and science fiction classics, we may have in this case a happy state of relative reliability of all the available forms.  [The Kindle edition mentioned in my new headnote to this review is not credited to a specific e-publisher, and does not contain much information on its ultimate source. The cover illustration for it (portraying the unicorn hunt) is therefore uncredited: it may be the work of Sidney Sime, Dunsany’s frequent illustrator, for the first edition. The text appears to have been cleanly, and accurately, reproduced. (I no longer have a print copy with which to compare it.)  [One annoyance of the Kindle version is that there are lots of “!” images depicting a stylized camera, apparently indicating that someone scanned a print copy which included page decorations at the end of chapters, and the digital conversion was unable to handle the designs. Each takes up a full “page” on my Kindle tablet, but only a small part of a “page” on my Cloud Reader (for Mac). On the Kindle app for Mac, the image is reduced to a thick line, which is at least less obtrusive.]	2004-11-07
US	30081986	R3K4V2E1E4BHJ6	0824804058	988756529	Japanese Poetry: The 'Uta' (English and Japanese Edition)	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Note to the Curious	I have long used a 1965 reprinting (Percy Lund, Humphries & Co., London) of this little volume -- 110 pages, including a glossary of the romanized texts which accompany the translations of mostly early Japanese poems (about two to a page, for eighty-odd pages). They are overwhelmingly -- to accept the assigned dates -- from the Nara and Heian periods, before the Japan of the samurai and Shoguns, but with a few examples from as late as the seventeenth century. (I don't recall any which are clearly dated more recently, but I may have missed one or two.) I've enjoyed them for years, although mostly by reading them in small quantities.     Originally published in 1919, and reprinted without change at long intervals, \\"Japanese Poetry: The 'Uta'\\" is one of the earliest examples of Arthur Waley's translations from the literatures of China and Japan (and, on a much smaller scale, from other languages). His translation of selected *No* plays would appear in 1921, and his version of the staggering novel, \\"The Tale of Genji,\\" in six volumes, would begin publication in the mid-1920s; sudden demonstrations to the English-reading world that Japan had an astonishing literature. He does not seem to have published later translations of Japanese poetry, although he prepared some for a BBC broadcast in the early 1950s, which were printed posthumously. (See the memorial volume edited by Ivan Morris, \\"Madly Singing in the Mountains.\\")     I mention how early the work is in Waley's career in part to make potential readers aware that the scholarship is essentially early twentieth century, and so to be treated with respect, but not complete confidence. (Even the text editions Waley worked from are mostly historical documents in themselves.) Also, however, to emphasize Waley's boldness. He had already annoyed established Sinologists by translating Chinese poems into daringly \\"modern\\" English forms, instead of Victorian rhyming stanzas. (As Waley pointed out, the Chinese poems did rhyme, butin tones, which could hardly be imitated anyway.)     Now, a complete amateur in this field as well as in Chinese studies, he was insisting on treating a genre of early Japanese poems (the five-line \\"uta\\" of the title) as little works of art, not linguistic and cultural data. Not the \\"done thing\\" -- even for some Japanese scholars, who preferred to scold their ancestors for poems showing excessive reverence for Chinese learning, and awarded extra points if they could read a text as \\"pure\\" Japanese.    (To judge from accounts by Robert Graves and others, many late- and post-Victorian English academics and other scholars seem to have been vulgar Kantians; saying they were studying something only out of Duty, and never admitting to enjoying it, especially not if it was something as trivial as Literature.)    Waley took the added step -- still not standard, I am sorry to say -- of providing each translation with a parallel romanized (transliterated) Japanese text, in order to call attention to the syllabic structure, and the word-plays and other sounds and devices of the poems. In his words: \\"The translations in this book are chiefly intended to facilitate the study of the Japanese text; for Japanese poetry can only be rightly enjoyed in the original.\\"    (This practice is found in, for example, some sections of the recent Columbia anthology of \\"Early Modern Japanese Literature,\\" edited by Haruo Shirane. Understandably, it is most often used with short forms, especially Haiku.)    This was undoubtedly an excellent idea. Although his translations are in many cases quite charming, they soon seem repetitious, for reasons beyond Waley's control. It helps to see how different poets actually expressed much the same thought in different ways -- and in similar ones, but with ingenious variations.     The body of poetry he had to work with came, overwhelmingly, from official anthologies (identified for each poem, with its number in the edition used). These collections were sponsored by Emperors (at least in name), and the contents represented approved examples of court poetry. (Waley does include some possible folk songs.) With the romanizations, the reader can have some inkling of sound patterns, and how they relate to the meaning -- an inkling, because (a) a transliteration is no substitute for the written, let alone the spoken language, and (b) the \\"classical\\" Japanese he offers is in any case the merest approximation of the tenth century court language (or the eighth or eleventh century, and so forth).     The poems had identifiable functions in an aristocratic milieu, and those found worthy of such preservation used a small variety of forms, and addressed a larger, but still limited, number of standard themes. They were offered at regularly occurring events (such as spring and autumn festivals), or in response to predictable passages of life. Readers of \\"Genji,\\" in Waley's translation or the two more recent ones, will remember the poetry contests, often on set subjects; those who have read translations of the diaries of Heian ladies of the court have encountered the seeming obsession with whose poems met with approval, and from whom. For the whole court, this was an important way of demonstrating sophistication, and acquiring prestige; for women, one of the few ways. In some instances, poetry and art contests were ways of redistributing wealth, keeping the participants dependent on the court. (In a similar environment, Louis XIV encouraged conspicuous consumption by the nobility, and left contests of wit to unofficial gatherings. The Japanese approach seems better -- but, in the end, the warriors came down from the provinces to sweep the courtiers aside, just as the Paris mob descended on Versailles, making way for a successful general.)     Waley's choice was further restricted by elimination from consideration of a substantial body of verse composed by courtiers in Chinese. Under the influences of the Confucian classics, Chinese Buddhism, and the T'ang Dynasty, it had the combined functions of a classical language, a sacred tongue, and a power-prestige speech, like Latin and / or Greek and French in eighteenth-century Europe. Thomas Lamarre has recently (2000) argued that the two linguistic options existed in productive contrast (see \\"Uncovering Heian Japan: An Archaeology of Sensation and Inscription\\"), and that Japanese verse should no longer be regarded as emerging from cultural repression. Another shift in approach after another century of scholarship, and not something Waley set out to explore.     As Lamarre has also emphasized, modern Japanese editions, like Waley's English version, obscure, with their typographic conventions and clear paper (as well as reduction to a theoretical linguistic norm), the calligraphic and decorative details of the original manuscript versions; but that, too is another issue.	2004-11-06
US	30081986	RJ6KUXZ3BQ2H3	0231096259	291658728	The Cosmographia of Bernardus Silvestris	Books	5	74	76	N	Y	Ian Myles Slater on: A Difficult Book, But Worth Attention	Like many of the relatively few who will recognize the name, I first encountered Bernardus Silvestris in the final pages of C.S. Lewis' 1938 science fiction novel &#34;Out of the Silent Planet.&#34; He is mentioned there as a twelfth-century Platonist who, in addition to writing difficult Latin, used the Malacandrian (Martian) word &#34;Oyarsa&#34; for a class of superior spirits. At the time (the middle 1960s), if I paid any attention at all, I probably assumed that &#34;Bernard of the Forest&#34; was Lewis's version of Lovecraft's Abdul Alhazred, celebrated author of the &#34;Necronomicon&#34; -- an impressive-sounding but non-existent reference. (L. Sprague de Camp's &#34;Science Fiction Handbook,&#34; which had sent me to Lewis's books, referred vaguely, but on the whole correctly, to Lewis' use of Neo-Platonic and Gnostic ideas, which would not have clued me in.)<br /><br />If I thought so, I was corrected by the discussion of Bernardus (in English, often simply Bernard) and the &#34;School of Chartres&#34; (a disputed concept, although now apparently back in favor) when I went on to read Lewis' &#34;Allegory of Love&#34; (1936), a study of medieval literature. Bernardus' &#34;De Mundi Universitate,&#34; also known as the &#34;Cosmographia,&#34; described with proper bibliographic information, there comes in for some attention as a Latin precursor to later allegorical works in vernacular languages. Bernardus appeared in my reading again, providing examples of medieval concepts and terms, in Lewis' late work, &#34;The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature&#34; (1964).<br /><br />Still later, as an undergraduate at UCLA, my curiosity aroused by Lewis' quotations, but with no translation in existence, I tried the available Latin text; and I was hardly the only academically-inclined Lewis fan with access to a copy to make the attempt. I soon discovered that (a) Lewis was right about the difficult Latin (and what was difficult for a character in his novel was pretty much impossible for me!), and that (b) the existing edition (Barach and Wrobel, 1876) didn't seem to be very well-edited, which could hardly help matters.<br /><br />Both feelings about the Latin text were confirmed when, not so very long after that sobering experience, Winthrop Wetherbee's translation appeared in 1973, as &#34;The *Cosmographia* of Bernardus Silvestris.&#34; The slender volume included a useful introduction, with textual notes explaining departures from the printed text, and a separate set of explanatory notes following the translation.<br /><br />The latter were definitely necessary. Reading the book, even in English, proved to be a difficult experience. It did have rewards, beyond finding out what Lewis had been talking about. It offered a look at the unexpected intellectual equipment of a medieval Christian philosopher *before* the Aristotelian revolution, and a Platonism unconnected to the Italian Renaissance, and any Greek texts. (I specify because of the intermittent controversy over a &#34;Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,&#34; in which Bernardus and his possible associates can serve as an exhibit.)<br /><br />It was also, in places, quite charming. Lewis was right about that (although some of his preferred readings of the Latin, and his graceful translations, have had to be dropped in favor of other manuscript evidence.)<br /><br />I eventually acquired a copy of my own (used; the price asked for the hardcover in the 1970s then seemed extortionate), and have re-read it several times. Still not easy, but always interesting. Eventually, while a graduate student in English literature, I began to feel that I sort of understood it.<br /><br />[Additional comment, November 2016: I've taken a good look at this fairly old review, in preparation for reviewing Wetherbee's recent text-and-translation edition, and feel that back then I left out something important. Wetherbee clears away the lexical and grammatical difficulties facing the reader of the &#34;Cosmographia,&#34; and the resulting translation is attractive, and reads smoothly. The difficulties come in understanding what *outside* the poem Bernardus was talking about in this allegorical narrative. There is a short, but distinguished, list of medievalists who have come up with contradictory answers -- including whether or not the work can be described as Christian -- and Wetherbee (and before him, Theodore Silverstein, in an important article) thinks that they all got it seriously wrong.]<br /><br />The &#34;Cosmographia&#34; is a description of the creation and form of the Universe, using ideas from the rather obscure writer Chalcidius (or, as now preferred, Calcidius), whose Latin commentary on a portion of Plato's dialogue &#34;Timaeus&#34; included the only genuine Platonic text available in Latin Christendom for centuries. &#34;Cosmographia&#34; itself was a sort of dialogue, but in a mixture of verse and prose, as used in the &#34;Consolation of Philosophy&#34; of Boethius (one of the key works of the Middle Ages). Wetherbee identifies allusions to the Pseudo-Dionysius, to Macrobius, and to the Latin translation of the Hermetic *Asclepius* attributed to Apuleius, among others. At times it seems to be expressing Christian ideas in pagan terms, at others dressing up pagan philosophy for Christian readers. It bears little resemblance to Scholastic texts, although Lewis was certainly correct to compare it, in terms of genre if not traceable connections, to the &#34;Romance of the Rose.&#34;<br /><br />I'm going to say STOP RIGHT HERE. If these names and terms mean absolutely NOTHING to you, you will be wasting your time trying to read Bernardus, in any language. If they are a little familiar to you, you will probably need to read a lot more about the literature of medieval Europe before trying it. Better still, add to your readings translations of at least some of the works I have mentioned (Plato instead of Calcidius, although he is, slowly, appearing in English), and some accounts of a number of others I haven't included (Alanus Insulis, something of a follower of Bernardus, for example). If you haven't read Lewis' &#34;The Discarded Image,&#34; it would probably be a good place to start.<br /><br />This may sound like snobbery, but Bernardus was esoteric in his own time, and I am not going to advise anyone to read it without some proper preparation. As I said, it would be a waste of time -- think of running a Marathon without training. I have given it five stars because Wetherbee did a difficult job remarkably well, not because I expect a lot of people to like it.<br /><br />Of course, if you are motivated enough, you can always try it.<br /><br />Personally, I had already done of lot of this reading at my first attempt at Wetherbee's volume, and eventually got around to filling in some of the rest. But I also took advantage of a shortcut. Brian Stock's &#34;Myth and Science in the Twelfth Century: A Study of Bernard Silvester&#34; (Princeton University Press) had appeared the previous year, and I raced through a library copy before it could be recalled.<br /><br />Although not in total agreement with Wetherbee about Bernardus by any means, Stock proved an invaluable guide to the material, and the existing secondary literature. He also provided useful suggestions on how to read such a text, which doesn't quite correspond to anything in modern literature. I still needed to do a lot of catching up, but this was a real boost.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Stock's book is out of print (and perhaps somewhat more out of date than the translation, due in part to the author's own later work). The current asking price for used copies of it seems to me unreasonably steep, except as a tribute to the book's intellectual value. If you are interested, by all means try a library! If you are the sort of person to really want to understand this branch of medieval literature, you will find yourself using his bibliography as a reading guide.<br /><br />Wetherbee's translation, on the other hand, has achieved a trade paperback incarnation (1990), and in this form, as university press books with a limited market go, is not too expensive. (The hardcover -- apparently reprinted at the same time, with a much more attractive cover than my old copy -- is still high-priced, and probably aimed at libraries with a generous budget.) I find it easier to imagine it as a text in a graduate seminar than in any but the most rarefied undergraduate course, but I hope that it will continue to find readers, and continue to open eyes to a neglected corner of European thought.<br /><br />Note: The truly dedicated may want to look into another work by (or &#34;Commonly Attributed to&#34;) Bernardus: the &#34;Commentary on the First Six Books of Virgil's Aeneid,&#34; translated with introduction and notes by Earl G. Schreiber and Thomas E. Maresca (1977). There was also a text edition the same year, edited by  J.W. Jones and E.F. Jones (from which I take the &#34;commonly attributed&#34; description).

Judging from descriptions of earlier volumes, this will not contain a commentary. (The Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library seems to have a format based on that of the Loeb Classical Library, with facing translations but minimal critical apparatus and/or annotations.)]<br /><br />[Further Addendum, November 2016: I had forgotten that I mentioned Brian Stock's &#34;Myth and Science in the Twelfth Century: A Study of Bernard Silvester&#34; in this review, so I'm a little late in passing on the information that the book is again available, in hardcover and paperback,  from Princeton University Press, in its Princeton Legacy Library series of print-on-demand scholarly books. (Try searching for &#34;Princeton Legacy Library,&#34; and then use its search function to search for the book by author or title.)

I intend to do a full review of the volume -- someday.<br /><br />[I have also obtained a used copy of the original edition of Brian Stock's &#34;Myth and Science,&#34; and found that the dust jacket announced Winthrop Wetherbee's &#34;Platonism and Poetry in the Twelfth Century: The Literary Influence of the School of Chartres.&#34; I strongly suspect that I read it, way back in the early 1970s, but I had forgotten the title and/or that it was by Wetherbee, and in any case failed to distinguish it from Stock's &#34;Myth and Science.&#34; My apologies to Professor Wetherbee for this oversight.]W.

I have been working my way through it, It seems to be a good, clean transfer (but the end notes are not hyperlinked to the text).]  [New Addendum, February 2015: a Latin text and translation (by Wetherbee) of the &#34;Cosmographia&#34; and another work, &#34;Mathematicus&#34; (The Astrologer), have been announced for April 2015, as Bernardus Silvestris, &#34;Poetic Works&#34; (a volume in the recently-launched Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library). Judging from descriptions of earlier volumes, this will not contain a commentary. (The Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library seems to have a format based on that of the Loeb Classical Library, with facing translations but minimal critical apparatus and/or annotations.)]h function to search for the book by author or title.) Amazon apparently does not offer the print-on-demand edition directly, but third-party sellers are offering copies, sometimes for considerably under the list price.]  [Addenda, June 2017: Since I last edited this review, I have obtained a copy of the Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library &#34;&#34;Poetic Works&#34; of Bernardus Silvestris, which I mentioned as forthcoming. It turns out to have a commentary to the &#34;Cosmographia,&#34; if not quite as copious as the earlier one, but also contains three other works: &#34;Mathematicus&#34; (The Astrologer), &#34;De Gemellis&#34; (The Twins),  and &#34;De Paupere Ingrato&#34; (The Ungrateful Pauper). I intend to do a full review of the volume -- someday.  [I have also obtained a used copy of the original edition of Brian Stock's &#34;Myth and Science,&#34; and found that the dust jacket announced Winthrop Wetherbee's &#34;Platonism and Poetry in the Twelfth Century: The Literary Influence of the School of Chartres.&#34; I strongly suspect that I read it, way back in the early 1970s, but I had forgotten the title and/or that it was by Wetherbee, and in any case failed to distinguish it from Stock's &#34;Myth and Science.&#34; My apologies to Professor Wetherbee for this oversight.]	2004-11-02
US	30081986	R1PFU6PKYBBEZU	0231109911	303487136	Early Modern Japanese Literature: An Anthology, 1600-1900 (Abridged Edition) (Translations from the Asian Classics)	Books	5	14	18	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: No Rivals on the Horizon	I have hardly made much progress through these 2000-plus pages, containing the work of thirty-two contributors, some immediately recognizable, others unfamiliar to me, and two (Donald Keene and Burton Watson) well-represented on my shelves. The library copy I started reading a couple of years ago was in demand, and I only had a short time to use it. I also skipped around quite a lot; it invites browsing. With the paperback edition now in my hands, however, I feel it would be useful to post a note (a sort of review-in-progress) both to clarify statements in one of the reviews of the hardcover edition, and give a general impression of the book for those even *less* at home in Japanese studies than myself.<br /><br />Haruo Shirane's \\"Early Modern Japanese Literature\\" appears to have been designed to serve, along with a companion volume on earlier Japanese literature, as the equivalent of the well-known \\"Norton Anthology of English Literature,\\" available for classroom use as much, or more, as for casual reading. At least, this is my guess at what was in the mind of the Columbia University Press editorial director, Jennifer Crewe, whom the editor credits with suggesting and facilitating the project.<br /><br />As in the Norton volumes, there is a lot of historical information in an extended introduction (the whole first section), and clear introductions to the following twenty-six sections on specific genres. Again, informative-looking notes are abundant in some sections, although rare in others, corresponding to a reader's likely needs, not a critic's desire to offer new interpretations. (So far I have found them very helpful.)<br /><br />It differs from the Norton Anthologies and other American textbooks of literature in one particular. Japanese printed literature has traditionally been illustrated, and examples are provided here. The captions to period woodcut illustrations are generally to the point; a few longer examples explain inscriptions, the conventions used byillustrators, or aspects of Japanese life being portrayed. There are also photographs from modern Japanese productions of classic puppet plays, which fill in gaps in the imagination. (But not another sort of gap: some of the plays are of Shakespearean proportions, and, to fully illustrate their variety, many are represented by excerpts, single acts, or even scenes. Inevitably, the longer forms suffer in this sort of compilation.)<br /><br />Despite a complaint of many typographical errors, I have not so far spotted readily identifiable misprints in the sections I have read. They could be concentrated elsewhere. Some *should* be present in a book this size, and I may be reading past them; or many may have been silently corrected in the paperback edition.<br /><br />Or the complaint may be about the treatment of Japanese words and proper names, which I would *not* be able to spot, barring inconsistencies within a line or two to tip me off to a problem. And, naturally, the pages are filled with such names and words, in fairly technical-looking spellings  -- probably enough to discourage some readers. (I don't even want to think about the proof-reading involved!)<br /><br />What I have found, however, is a statement that the romanization (transliteration to the rest of us) \\"is based on the Hepburn system,\\" which is not terribly specific about what to expect. This may account for at least part of the complaint, and is a general issue with translations from Japanese, and so, I think, is worth pointing out.<br /><br />The short version is: if you aren't familiar with the standard romanization used in translations from Japanese literature, the book is going to look REALLY WEIRD.<br /><br /> (You can skip the next several paragraphs if you are not interested in the problems of rendering words from a foreign language into English, using the standard Roman alphabet, or are familiar with the problems. I've had to spend enough time trying to figure this out to feel that some people might want to be warned in advance.)<br /><br />Hepburn, a pioneering English-language scholar of the Japanese language, seems to have had a \\"tin ear\\" for sounds not consistently distinguished in English, but significant in Japanese -- phonemes, for those who know the term. His ear apparently was not as bad as that of the originators of the Wade-Giles system for Chinese (which in this volume is represented by Pinyin), and a system once sponsored by the Japanese government seems to have been even more confusing, but it still produces complications. (I could suggest three or four books which discuss the problem at various levels of difficulty -- most of them soon going beyond my ability to follow -- but a short, well-written non-technical account is presently available on-line; search for Andrew Horvat, \\"Total Quality Japanese: The Romaji (Roomaji) Conundrum.\\")<br /><br />The Hepburn system has been modified several times in the last century, beginning with introducing \\"glides\\" where Hepburn had missed them, so that the spelling \\"Tokio\\" (To-ki-o) became the now-familiar \\"Tokyo\\" (To-kyo) -- with or without a macron (long mark) over the final vowel. Other changes are not always consistent, internally, or with other alterations; not to mention cases of publishers discarding long marks and apostrophes, which makes it less accurate instead of more. Anyone used to reading  (or to employing!) a different variation of the Hepburn romanization is going to see some (not all) Japanese names and words in \\"incorrect\\" forms in this book, and many others.<br /><br />If the \\"errors\\" in this or another book are consistent, they probably are intended spellings, based on a different standard. Irritating to those who want everyone to be consistent in another system, and a real pest if, like me, you are comparing translations, or histories, and aren't able to deal with the Japanese directly, but that is how it is.<br /><br />In addition, there are several more recent systems based directly on Japanese orthography, which allows software to convert text from one script to another, but look odd to those who expect to see the Hepburn spellings. (And vice-versa.) Some rather sharp exchanges have been going on in recent years over the preferred standards for romanizing manga and anime, particularly since commercial versions of these seem to be hit-or-miss, or consistently inconsistent, on this problem.<br /><br />If you think that this situation is annoying, try the truly strange-looking variations current among Classicists (such as Aeschylus *or* Aischulos, Thucydides *or* Thoukudides), as they attempt (or refuse to attempt) to replace time-honored English versions of Latin versions of Greek names with actual transliterations!<br /><br />To resume the direct review (following from REALLY WEIRD):<br /><br />In this case, \\"based on the Hepburn system\\" does turn out to include marking long vowels, and other features often discarded by commercial publishers. It is not for nothing that this volume is part of the Columbia \\"Translations from the Asian Classics\\" series, and produced to a standard at least tolerable to professional scholars, who by and large do manage to use pretty much the same approach. I find it a bit distracting, but have come to appreciate its importance.<br /><br />Of course, the Japanese language was never a single, static, thing, but has a history. (Hepburn, for example, apparently used nineteenth-century Edo [Tokyo] speech as his standard.) As usual, local and class dialects, and changes over time, are not without significance for a literature. In other translations from Japanese, I have seen attempts to reproduce such variations in English (fortunately without the apparent Cockneys and Scots I have spotted in other contexts). In this book, transliterations are offered of some eighteenth-century \\"Comic and Satiric Poetry\\" (pages 520-537), with attention called in the notes to how words were actually being pronounced. (I found this very interesting, and I would hope that such statements are not taken for \\"mistakes\\" in Japanese.)<br /><br />On another front, Donald Keene's 1976 book \\"World Within Walls: Japanese Literature of the Pre-Modern Era, 1600-1867\\" is NOT a rival anthology ignored by the publicity for \\"Early Modern Japanese Literature.\\" It is the second of three volumes in Keene's impressive \\"History of Japanese Literature.\\" It is listed here in the first section of the generous (pages 968-981) \\"English Language Bibliography,\\" which includes an impressive number of translations of writers or texts included in the anthology, and an abundance of critical literature. (I had no idea just how much Japanese literature of those three centuries was now available in English; fortunately, in this area I never thought of myself as more than a casual reader!)<br /><br />Since the announced aim of the collection was to be representative, considerable duplication of existing translations of important works was only to be expected. Although there are collections covering more works in certain genres, I am inclined to accept the claim of unprecedented coverage of the major literary forms of three centuries.<br /><br />Some will probably continue to prefer Donald Keene's old (1955) \\"Anthology of Japanese Literature, from the Earliest Era to the Mid-Nineteenth Century\\" and its (1956) companion, \\"Modern Japanese Literature: An Anthology,\\" (from 1868 to the post-war \\"present day\\") on aesthetic, if not sentimental, grounds. A school library's copies were (along with Heian-era works translated by Arthur Waley, and Ivan Morris) my own introduction to Japanese literature, and I later acquired an Evergreen paperback edition of the former. Keene's two volumes are very different in their emphasis, covering both longer and shorter periods of time. But I am happy to have both selections available -- and look forward to Columbia's companion volume on Japan before 1600.<br /><br />(Note: Columbia has announced for March 2005 the publication of \\"The Columbia Anthology of Modern Japanese Literature,\\" edited by J. Thomas Rimer; picking up where Haruo Shirane's volume leaves off, this should cover the writings of the twentieth century in considerable detail. It will be interesting to see what genres are chosen for representation.)	2004-11-01
US	30081986	R316N5QOTNON28	0802860605	235200045	Phantastes	Books	5	10	12	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Long Before Tolkien	\\"Phantastes,\\" published in 1858, was the first of two remarkable fantasy novels for adults by George MacDonald (1824-1905); the other is \\"Lilith,\\" which appeared near the end of his life, in 1897. These are sometimes referred to as \\"Visionary Novels,\\" which does suggest their use of imagery, and dream-like narrative, but could also suggest, incorrectly, a \\"prophetic\\" or apocalyptic element. The recent (2000) Eerdmans trade paperback re-release of their 1981 edition is the occasion of this review, although I mention some other editions in passing. Like a companion edition of \\"Lilith,\\" it has an introduction by C.S. Lewis, abridged from his Preface to \\"George MacDonald: An Anthology\\" (1947), and previously used in an omnibus edition of the novels (see below).    Despite what some may find an over-abundance of mid-Victorian floral fairies, and some mediocre sentimental/erotic poems, \\"Phantastes\\" is a mostly very successful effort to transfer into a \\"common-sense\\" tradition of \\"rationalized' supernatural stories some aspects, both bizarre and idealized, of German Romanticism. (For those who know that literature, try to imagine a combination of the robust stories of E.T.A. Hoffmann with the \\"magic idealism\\" of Novalis; although there is in fact no close parallel or \\"source.\\") There is a plot, which eventually becomes evident (although for some critics, even this is controversial); but the puzzles posed by a constant variety of events, and MacDonald's flashes of invention, may be what hold the reader's attention for a good part of the novel. (These inventions include a brief, and for the most part remarkably plausible, pastiche of Malory's \\"Morte D'Arthur,\\" one of the interrupted texts and stories which dot the narrative, and suggest a variety of possible interpretations.)    This was a first novel, in a mode to which MacDonald would not return at such length, and for adult readers, for another forty years, for reasons that were probably at least as much practical as artistic; there just wasn't much of a demand for experimental fiction, and he needed to support his family.     The two fantasy novels, a variety of equally extraordinary long (e.g., \\"The Light Princess,\\" \\"The Golden Key,\\" \\"The Wise Woman\\") and short fairy tales, and his fairy tale novels for children, \\"At the Back of the North Wind\\" (1871) and the two \\"Curdie\\" books, \\"The Princess and the Goblin\\" (1872) and \\"The Princess and Curdie\\" (1882), are probably the author's lasting legacy. I say *probably* on the remote chance of a great revival of interest in his more numerous, and conventionally \\"realistic,\\" novels of Scottish life, which were more successful with contemporaries, and do have their admirers.    There are people who find spiritual sustenance in the writings of George MacDonald -- I'm not one of them, and would not attempt any comments here on MacDonald's spiritual or moral positions, in or out of his novels. These views were not inconsequential, and he would not have avoided them; MacDonald spent much of his life struggling to make a living after being forced out of his only secure position as a dissenting Minister. However, to be more than blandly superficial would require the aid of a biographer well-enough versed in nineteenth-century Scots Calvinism to recognize MacDonald's agreements with it, as well as \\"heretical\\" departures, in his fiction as well as his life. (I specify the Scots element in part because it was the constant background of his life and work, and in part because he was accused of tendencies toward \\"German Religion\\" instead of the home-grown variety.)    Let's just say, instead, that his books do raise theological and moral issues, the latter more indirectly in the two adult novels than in the books for children. Some call them moral allegories, which seems too me to stretch the (often very loose) definition of allegory. Anyone looking for a  close resemblance to \\"The Pilgrim's Progress,\\" or the Chronicles of Narnia, will probably be disappointed.     The fantasies can all be read for their value as entertaining literature, and emphasizing MacDonald as a Christian thinker and moralist may drive away as many readers as it attracts, which rather defeats any purpose except \\"preaching to the choir.\\" This is the main drawback I can see to the (often attractive) packaging and repackaging in recent years of MacDonald's fairy tales by Eerdmans, among other religious publishers. (Eerdmans released a set of mass-market paperbacks in the 1980s, redistributing material in its two-volume 1973 trade paperback, \\"The Gifts of the Child Christ: Fairy Stories for the Childlike.\\" For those more comfortable with secular publishers, and their distributors, there is now a fat one-volume Penguin Classics collection of \\"The Complete Fairy Tales\\" from Penguin Books; and their Puffin imprint continues to reprint the \\"Curdie\\" books.)    The present Eerdmans edition of \\"Phantastes,\\" originally issued in a mass-market paperback in 1981, is here nicely printed in very legible type, in a larger (trade paperback) format; Jim Lamb's cover art has survived the change to a larger size. It is the most attractive form I have seen -- easier on the eyes than the old Eerdmans omnibus edition with \\"Lilith,\\" on which I had relied for years (1964, reprinted 1975; also a trade paperback, it was apparently reprinted from the Victor Gollancz edition of 1962).    For long-time fantasy readers, such as myself, it is clearly preferable on textual grounds to the Ballantine Books Adult Fantasy edition (1970), which Lin Carter abridged by cutting MacDonald's verse. That decision subverted the considerable service to fantasy readers of bringing the book to their attention (along with, in the same series, \\"Lilith\\" in 1969, and, in 1972, some of the fairy tales, in the well-chosen collection, \\"Evenor\\"). The verse is not great poetry, but it is not very bad, either, and it is significant to the characterization, and to a lesser degree the plot.    Note forthe curious: The founding of the George MacDonald Society in 1981 seems to have marked a general resurgence of interest in his life and works. Its journal is \\"North Wind\\" (it should soon reach volume 24), and it now has a useful website. Another on-line resource is the well-maintained \\"The Golden Key\\" (George MacDonald WWW Page). Some of the coverage at these and other sites is fairly esoteric-looking, but interests served range from advice on children's reading to advanced critical theory, by way of, among other topics, Victorian literary history, theology, and textual studies.	2004-10-25
US	30081986	R31CLCX8AB585E	1587159988	917168973	Twenty-Two Goblins	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Sanskrit Tales from a Cemetery	Classical Sanskrit literature (beyond the many religious and philosophical texts) includes a number of story collections, in which, inside a larger frame story, characters tell stories to each other, some of the stories containing stories told by characters in those stories, and so on. (This is not unknown in the west, of course; Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\" is only one example.)    Although most make some claim to a moral or doctrinal purpose, their primary function is to entertain. Some Indian examples, like the present work, \\"Twenty-Two Goblins,\\" are fairly brief. A few, like the well-named \\"Ocean of Story\\" of Somadeva, are immense. (The full title is \\"Katha sarit sagara,\\" more exactly \\"The Ocean of Streams of Story.\\"). There are translations, and similar works, in many of the vernacular and other learned languages of India.    Some are really anthologies, with the opening frame merely a device, a form of organization. To judge from its extant texts, the \\"Panchatantra,\\" a very well-known collection of fables, never returned in a conclusion to its opening of a wise teacher giving sugar-coated advice to some dull-witted princes. (Original version from around 300 C.E. For a modern translation, with an up-to-date introduction on its complex history, see Patrick Olivelle, \\"The Pancatantra.\\") A simple, and elegant, approach is that of the Buddhist \\"Jatakas,\\" in which each main story concerns a pre-enlightenment incarnation of the Buddha, so that the collection seems to move toward an historical destination, despite variations in the selection, number, and order of tales in different versions.    Others are more like novels, with a plot that is introduced at the beginning, advanced from time to time in a return to the frame, and in some way resolved at the end, even if the individual tales are what remain with the reader; at least some of the tales contribute to either the theme of the frame story, or the plot development.    The anonymous \\"Twenty-Two Goblins\\" (*Vetalapanchavimsati*), while not all *that* tightly structured, is an example of this latter genre, and, in my experience, one of the most consistently entertaining as well. While not quite in the usual line for Wildside, it is a welcome addition to their list; and a welcome new edition of a translation originally published before World War I, and long out of print (although a Gutenberg e-text has been available for several years). Whether regarded as a novel or an anthology, it is close enough to modern fantasy literature to appeal to adventurous readers.    Its framing device bears a close resemblance to that in another novel / collection which is fairly well known in English, translated in part by Sir Richard Francis Burton as \\"Vikram and the Vampire.\\" In both works, a king, at the request of an apparent holy man, enters by night a cremation ground or other place of death, and there encounters a demon which subjects him to an ordeal of courage and endurance, while also telling a puzzle story which will serve as a test of the king's ingenuity and moral discrimination. The process is repeated with variations on subsequent nights. (This, again, is not unique to India, although the elaboration seems to be; in an Irish parallel, a monarch offers a reward to someone who will go out at night, etc., with a similar result.) The title of this work suggests how many such supernatural raconteurs are involved in this case.    \\"Twenty-Two Goblins\\" however, is a only a bit shorter than Burton's \\"Vikram,\\" even though the latter contains eleven of an original twenty-five stories. (According to the 1893 posthumous edition and its reprintings; I haven't seen his rather rare 1870 edition!)    \\"Goblins\\" is quite different in the details of events and characterization, and has a different set of tales. I read both, in library copies, many years ago; on re-reading parts in preparing this review, I found that I been lumping them together in memory, but had remembered more of Ryder's book than I realized. Judging strictly by Ryder's and Burton's translations, \\"Twenty-Two Goblins\\" is rather more gracefully told, and presents fewer obstacles to the reader. (It is also more clearly based on an identifiable Sanskrit edition; Burton is remarkably hazy about how much use he has made of the Sanskrit and how much of vernacular versions of the collection which he also mentions.)    Unlike Burton's work, Ryder's is designed to be read as a charming (although occasionally grim) book of stories, instead of as a source of ethnographic information on ancient or medieval India, with nuances of Sanskrit represented by odd varieties of English. Ryder successfully conveyed through his translation his conviction that he was dealing with a work of literature which could be read for entertainment, and needed no additional justification.    (Note that this is NOT a comparison of the two *Sanskrit* works as such. Burton, who usually worked with a -- silent -- collaborator, tried to explain *everything* to stay-at-home Victorian readers. This is good in itself, but he sometimes took it to extremes. He had a tendency to re-invent English, often to suit his impression of an exotic \\"Oriental\\" tongue -- to be fair this also is true of his style in translations from several European languages as well. The extreme example of Burton at work -- not from Sanskrit -- is his eccentric and often densely annotated translation of another structured collection, \\"The Thousand and One Nights.\\" Burton's gibe that a predecessor's work should have been titled \\"The Arabian Notes\\" instead of \\"The Arabian Nights\\" was soon applied to his work instead.)    As already suggested, Ryder seems to have worked hard at making the translation appealing. Although the language is formal, he never resorts to dressing up even plain statements in the pseudo-Biblical English preferred by many Indologist-translators in the nineteenth century, and much of the twentieth. The flowery literary Sanskrit -- to modern tastes, perhaps excessively flowery -- is not further distanced by a profusion of obsolete verb forms and Elizabethan (or pseudo-Elizabethan) vocabulary.    Arthur W. Ryder (1877-1938) was part of the founding generation of Sanskrit studies in American universities. He worked extensively with the major literary forms of classical Sanskrit, both prose and verse. He has a certain renown outside the field for having, late in his life, taught Sanskrit and Hindu ethics to a fellow-professor at Berkeley, a young physicist, who in turn seems to have paraphrased Ryder's translation of the \\"Bhagavad-Gita\\" while watching the first atomic blast -- see, on-line, James A Hijiya, \\"The *Gita* of J. Robert Oppenheimer.\\" [Since Amazon now allows URLs, try [...] ]    Ryder is probably best known to readers in recent times for a translation (textually obsolete, but, once again, pleasant reading) of the \\"Panchatantra\\" (his transliteration; reprinted several times in the 1950s and 1960s by the University of Chicago Press, including a Phoenix Paperback edition), and a collection of works by the great Indian playwright Kalidasa, \\"Shakuntala and Other Writings,\\" published in the popularly-priced Dent \\"Everyman's Library\\" series in 1907, and reprinted in the U.S. by Dutton, in paperback from the 1960s onward.    Ryder translated at least one other work in the novel / story-cycle genre, the sixth or seventh century \\"Dandin's Dasha-Kumara-Charita: The Ten Princes,\\" originally published by the University of Chicago Press in 1927. One of two surviving works by Dandin, an acknowledged master of literary Sanskrit, the \\"Dasha-Kumara-Charita\\" is, perhaps, better known by the shorter cover title, \\"The Ten Princes.\\" An older translation, by the nineteenth-century scholar H.H. Wilson, was recently reprinted in India as \\"Dasakumara Charita: Adventures of the Ten Princes.\\"    Ryder's version of \\"The Ten Princes\\" may be worth reprinting as well -- perhaps Wildside is considering it as a companion to \\"Twenty-Two Goblins.\\" However, New York University Press has announced a forthcoming (February 2005) publication of \\"The Ten Princes,\\" edited and translated by Isabelle Onians (see the listing on Amazon), which may render the whole question moot, at least for readers interested in more up-to-date scholarship.	2004-10-23
US	30081986	R26JA85FKCY4M3	1590170512	127646158	Fancies and Goodnights (New York Review Books)	Books	5	47	49	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Complete Reprint	\\"Fancies and Goodnights\\" is a superb selection of John Collier's short stories: the enthusiastic reviews on Amazon are a good measure of the response of many readers to his mixture of whimsy, satire, understatement, ingenious concepts, and very polite English bemusement -- with the first half of the twentieth century in general, and New York and Hollywood in particular.    I am adding this review to the chorus of praise because there is some possible bibliographical confusion (as an earlier reviewer briefly warned).    The title \\"Fancies and Goodnights\\" has been used for two related collections, one a shorter version of the other. The 1951 version, of which this \\"New York Review Books\\" edition is a complete reprinting, contained fifty stories. This is far and away the better of the two. It has been reprinted before; I have a copy of a \\"Bantam Giant\\" mass-market paperback from 1953.    A shorter edition, with only thirty-two of the stories, has also been published under the same title. A copy of this shorter \\"Fancies and Goodnights\\" I have on hand is an edition issued in the old Time Reading Program Special Edition series (1965). It includes much praise of Collier by Fred Hoyle (then at the height of his fame as an astronomer/cosmologist/novelist), but no notice (so far as I can see) that it was not the full version, and that a reader who knew the older form could search it in vain for a remembered story. Copies of this \\"revised edition\\" dated at least as late as 1980 are available.    I am not sure if the Time Reading Program edition was the first short-text version. I once did a library search for copies, twenty-some years ago, and I believe that I found at least one other such cut edition, from a different publisher, with the same reduced selection.    If you have one of these shorter versions, and are happy with it, you will almost certainly want the extra material available in the full version; some of the eighteen additional stories, at least, will be a real treat. If you are ordering a used copy, even if the publisher is not Time Life Books, you should try to compare the length to other editions.    To add to the complications, forty-one of these fifty stories were included, with some others not in \\"Fancies,\\" in the collection \\"The Best of John Collier\\" (Pocket Books paperback, 1975). The six added stories *may* make that volume an attractive acquisition to a Collier fan, despite the extensive overlap; and if you already have a copy, you *might* want to consider a full copy of \\"Fancies and Goodnights.\\"    However, \\"The Best ...\\" was itself a cut version of a larger volume!    \\"The John Collier Reader,\\" a long-out-of-print omnibus, included, in addition to the forty-seven short stories found in \\"The Best...,\\" two chapters from \\"Defy the Foul Fiend, or, The Misadventures of a Heart\\" (1934), and a complete text of another of Collier's novels, \\"His Monkey Wife, or, Married to a Chimp \\" (1930).    See what I mean about confusion?    (Unlike \\"Defy the Foul Fiend,\\" \\"His Monkey Wife\\" is currently in print, also as a New York Review Book. The adventures of an educated chimpanzee who attempts to look after her feckless Englishman, it is, depending on your point of view, an attack on men, or on women, or on marriage, with just a touch of satire on the Empire. For many of those who react to it strongly, it is either offensive but very funny, or just offensive. There are those who find it too funny to be offensive. I don't find it *successful* enough to have a strong opinion against it... or for it. It seems to me to contain a brilliant shorter work stretched beyond its limits.)    It is great to have \\"Fancies and Goodnights\\" back in print. For John Collier's fans -- or at least the fans of his short fiction -- there is an unmet need for a really comprehensive collection of his stories. In a more ideal world -- perhaps one arranged by one of Collier's polished fiends or bewildered angels -- a large, and non-overlapping, collection ofadditional Collier stories would be available as well.	2004-10-21

His time was the period of the Persian Wars. Of the other eight lyric greats, most, like Sappho, were renowned predecessors in previous generations, but two were working at the same time, and competed with him for patrons.<br /><br />These rivals were Simonides, who lived long enough to celebrate the old aristocracy, the \\"tyrants\\" who often replaced it, and then the new \\"democracy,\\" and his nephew, Bacchylides, who was Pindar's younger contemporary. Simonides is now most often mentioned for something he probably didn't compose, the Thermopylae epitaph, \\"Go! Tell the Spartans... .\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, over in Athens, young Aeschylus was a rising star with the new-fangled \\"tragedy.\\"<br /><br />This ranking, combined with the period in which he lived, makes Pindar a figure of Shakespearean proportions. However, most of the works of this \\"Lyric Age\\" are lost, except for fragments, and we might have been left to wonder about all the fuss over this Pindar, if we had the typical set of quotations and papyrus scraps.<br /><br />Fortunately, Pindar is to a large extent a great exception. Four \\"books\\" of his collected poems exist, intact (for all practical purposes), or at least pretty much as the Alexandrian scholars who assembled a larger edition had left them. This is the largest body of material from any of the poets of the late Archaic and early Classical periods to survive to modern times, but is not necessarily representative of Pindar's total body of work.<br /><br />The \\"Odes\\" are songs composed for celebrations in honor of victors in the major Games of ancient Greece (Olympic, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian), and are centered on athletes and wealthy patrons (owners of horses and chariot teams). Even the athletes normally belonged to aristocratic families, which could provide them with the time and coaching to train effectively. Despite the origin of the genre, it only partly and occasionally resembles modern public relations for super-star athletes.<br /><br />The public, celebratory, and partly secular nature of this part of his \\"collected works\\" may have helped their survival during the Middle Ages, when Byzantine scholars seem to have neglected both public, but too obviously pagan, and more private -- and usually erotic -- genres.<br /><br />This circumstance may seem to narrow the scope of the songs, but protocol demanded attention to the gods and heroes of the victor's city or family, or to some god or hero who could in some way be appropriately invoked as a comparison. As a result, the Epinician (Victory) Odes are a rich source of divine and heroic mythology -- when it can be teased out of Pindar's rich and frustratingly allusive verses. Pindar, with his displays of metrical virtuosity and sudden shifts of subject, has generally been the despair of translators.<br /><br />The main text of this book is G.S. Conway's 1972 translation of the \\"Odes.\\" Richard Stoneman has added an introduction presenting modern critical views, and redone the headnotes and extensive notes (somtimes suggesting different renderings) to each of the poems.<br /><br />Stoneman also added to the Everyman edition a selection of Fragments (some actually fairly extensive -- ten or twelve whole lines!), in his own translation. The Fragments include some \\"private\\" pieces, and portions of public hymns and choral works, giving some indication of Pindar's range, and the functions of poetry in his society. For those unfamiliar with the rest of the body of early Greek poetry -- Sappho is the most likely to be even a name -- this will also show how little we might otherwise know of a major figure.<br /><br />(For those who aren't familiar at all, or just would like a painless way to expand their knowledge -- Mary Renault's novel \\"The Praise Singer\\" portrays the earlier part of this period. It is offered as being remembered by the very old Simonides, who, although Renault glosses over the point, was famous in antiquity for inventing the \\"Art of Memory.\\" The young Pindar isn't present in the story, although Aeschylus gets a walk-on.)<br /><br />With these additions, the volume surpasses in general usefulness Frank Nisetich's translation of the Odes (\\"Victory Odes,\\" 1980), and the older translations by C.M. Bowra (\\"Odes,\\" 1969, a Penguin Classic, apparently currently back in print), and Richmond Lattimore's \\"Odes\\" (1947, second edition, 1976; a Phoenix paperback, but currently treated by Amazon as an edition of Bowra's Penguin Classic!). Whether it surpasses them in accuracy may be left to classical scholars; the question of readability lies with the individual reader. As I have noted in my reviews of the latter two translations, Bowra attempts to set the \\"Odes\\" in their chronological order, which complicates tracking references, while Lattimore may be clearer at times than the Greek really allows. Any good translation of Pindar is not going to be easy reading; he left simplicity to others.<br /><br />(There is also a two-volume bilingual edition in the Loeb Classical Library, edited and translated by W.H. Race, which includes even the smallest fragments.)<br /><br />Stoneman's commentary, based on current scholarship, attempts to clear away dead wood in the scholarly tradition dating back at least to Hellenistic times, and treat the poems as literature, not political columns or personal confessions. In the process, he manages to make clear the intensely aristocratic milieu in which Pindar, a member of a prominent Theban clan, usually worked, even as Athenian democracy was rising around him.<br /><br />[Addendum, September 6, 2013: In the years since I posted this review, at least two English translations of the complete \\"Odes\\" have been published -- I may have missed others. The first, \\"The Complete Odes,\\" translated by Anthony Verity, was published in Oxford World's Classics in 2007, and is available from Amazon in paperback and Kindle formats. The second, \\"Odes for Victorious Athletes,\\" translated by Anne Pippin Burnett, was published in the Johns Hopkins New Translations from Antiquity series in 2010. It is available from Amazon in Hardcover, paperback, and Kindle.]	2004-10-18
US	30081986	R3UMF2IYCL27XS	0674500105	184795948	The Kalevala: Or Poems of the Kaleva District	Books	5	132	134	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Two Reliable Versions	If you have found this review appearing with the Magoun translation of \\"The Kalevala\\"  -- that is a welcome paperback incarnation of a solid, reliable, standard translation, originally published four decades ago. I have reviewed the hardcover edition of this translation (see the variant title, \\"The Kalevala: Poems of the Kaleva District\\"), and also Magoun's similar rendering of the epic's first version, \\"The Old Kalevala,\\" and will summarize my description of the Finnish \\"national epic,\\" and its origin, here.     However, you may be seeing this review with the Keith Bosley verse translation of the (New) \\"Kalevala,\\" another reputable version. Having found that the two translations seem inseparably linked in terms of reviews, I have revised and expanded an older posting to take fuller account of both; if this review seems familiar to you, that is probably why.     \\"Kalevala,\\" variously translated as \\"Kaleva District\\" or \\"Land of Heroes,\\" is a nineteenth-century compilation, revision, and expansion of narratives, spells and charms, and proverbial wisdom collected from the Finnish-speaking peasants and fisherman of areas of modern Finland and Russia. It is made up largely, but not entirely, of \\"runos,\\" narrative songs which even then survived only in isolated, \\"fringe\\" areas; ballads with clear connections with other cultures also make an appearance. References to \\"The Kalevala\\" are usually to its second edition (1849), also distinguished as the \\"New Kalevala\\" in comparison to its shorter predecessor, the \\"Old Kalevala\\" (1835).     The material is, for the most part, clearly pagan in origin, with hints of roots in the Viking Age, if not earlier, but processed through centuries of Christianity, Catholic and Lutheran in Finland proper, Russian Orthodox in the Karelia district. Fortunately, Elias Lonnrot, the main collector, and the man responsible for this literary version, was also engaged in laying the foundations of the scientific study of folk traditions, and the collections he made or sponsored formed the basis of a major archive, the publication of which was only recently completed. In the meantime, his popularization had become a part of the world's culture, as well as that of Finland.     (As one example of its impact: the American poet Longfellow adapted a German translator's adaptation of the Finnish meter for his pseudo-Iroquois epic, \\"Hiawatha,\\" with the paradoxical result that the original is sometimes described, in English, as being in Hiawatha-meter.)     The contents are various, but the main themes are the military and romantic adventures and misadventures of a handful of warrior-magicians, quite as quick with an incantation as with a sword. Vainamoinen, \\"the Eternal Sage,\\" and a kind of demiurge who sings the Finnish homeland into being, is born an old man. His attempts -- always frustrated -- to find a young wife lead to the creation of the mysterious and wonderful \\"Sampo\\" by his friend, the smith Ilmarinen, as a kind of bride-price. However, Ilmarinen himself uses it in his own wooing -- and finds the bargain a bad one.     These two great heroes share the stage with the irresponsible Lemminkainen, a kind of combined Don Juan and Achilles, and the hapless Kullervo. Kullervo's story -- which you may know as a cantata by Sibelius -- is one of the underpinnings of Tolkien's  tale of Turin in \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"Unfinished Tales,\\" where it is combined with elements from the \\"Volsunga Saga.\\" (When the \\"Silmarillion\\" first appeared, it seemed obvious that the Quest for the Sampo, and the Sampo's ultimate fate, was a direct source as well as a major inspiration for Tolkien; publication of his early drafts show that most of these resemblances emerged over time, in the course of endless reworkings, but they remain enlightening. Other resemblances include the creation of the sun and moon, and attempts to harm them, and the importance of trees. There are also some similar -- not identical -- names, and Tolkien's study of Finnish contributed to the development of a branch of Elvish.)     There have been a number of abridged or retold versions of \\"The Kalevala\\" in English, and two early complete versions in verse, that by Crawford (nineteenth-century, from a German translation; available on-line), and the 1907 W.F. Kirby translation, directly from Finnish (in -- if you will excuse the expression -- a version of Hiawatha-meter), which was Tolkien's introduction to the work. Magoun's translation (1963) filled a need for a more literal treatment, with more supporting information.     Since Magoun's prose translations, there have been two translations of the \\"New Kalevala\\" into English verse, by Eino Friberg (1988) and, as previously mentioned, Keith Bosley (1989), which many will find more appealing. But for those who want both the story and all of the details, but either don't care about, or don't care for, such things as meter and rhyme, Magoun's translation remains a first choice. For those who know the epic through other translations, it is still worth consulting.     It should be said that Magoun, despite translating as prose, marks the verse divisions. He follows some Finnish editions in presenting the verse form as a long line with a pause (caesura), instead of as twice as many short lines. His page count therefore is much shorter, even with abundant supplemental material, but he has omitted nothing.     Magoun's translation and critical apparatus, like his similarly-equipped English version of the \\"Old Kalevala\\" (which includes several earlier stages of composition as well), is extremely useful to the student, and answers many of the questions a reader is likely to have. There is no extended introduction; information is postponed to extensive appendices. It is well organized enough to be easy to use to find answers as questions arise, or be profitably consulted years later.     (A friend recently pointed out to me that, with their maps, appendices, and indexes and glossary, theHarvard University Press volumes even have a remarkable *physical* similarity to editions of Tolkien's works....)     Bosley, on the other hand, made an effort to produce a work of literature. This goes beyond translating verse as verse (which he does very well). Lonnrot's prose summaries of each *runo* (for this purpose, canto) are not translated; Magoun used them as \\"arguments\\" (in the manner of Milton's prose summaries for each book of \\"Paradise Lost\\"). For Bosley, nothing interrupts the flow of narrative and lyric, ritual and spell. The result is extremely engaging, far beyond Magoun's prosy rendition; a distinct plus.     There are, however, no glossaries or indexes to otherwise serve as a guide through the complex set of stories. Bosley offers just ten pages of brief (albeit extremely useful) notes. These are followed by a two-page appendix on \\"Sibelius and the Kalevala,\\" which untangles the references -- and some non-references -- to the \\"Kalevala\\" in the titles of several of the Finnish composer's works. (A certain amount of garbling took place as his music publisher translated titles into German, and the German was turned into English without checking against the original meaning.)     Bosley's Introduction is excellent, and establishes the literary and cultural background of Lonnrot's work and the nature of the folk-poetry he collected, and makes useful observations about the structure of the completed epic. It is far better reading than Magoun's documentation. Of course, taking advantage of this synthesis means careful reading, ideally in advance of the story. The reader should take the time, but *should* is not *will.* Here, Magoun's formidable-looking book is actually more user-friendly.     The Magoun translation was available for decades as a hardcover (with endpaper maps), before being issued as an otherwise identical trade paperback. Either form should stand up to reasonable handling. (My copy of the 1975 hardcover third printing has suffered morefrom my marginal notes as a student than from later use or time; largely cross-references to the \\"Corrigenda,\\" the list of corrections and revisions which he had included as a supplement in his \\"Old Kalevala\\" translation in 1969, and then added as Appendix E to reprintings of \\"Kalevala\\" proper. They have yet to be incorporated into the text.)     Bosley's translation apparently has been published in paperback only, in two different formats; first as a \\"World's Classics\\" mass-market paperback (1989), and then as a larger (but otherwise identical) \\"Oxford World's Classics\\" paperback in 1999. It is a very fat volume, over 700 pages long, due to Bosley's decision to treat the verse as short lines. Because of the different proportions of height and width to the binding, the slightly larger format of the OWC edition seems to me physically more stable, likely to stand up better to repeated readings and consultations; but I haven't heard of any problems with copies of the older World's Classics printings.     Lonnrot also published (1840-41) a collection of non-epic folk genres, including much material eventually absorbed into \\"Kalevala,\\" as \\"Kanteletar\\" (roughly, \\"zither-daughter\\"). This has been under-represented in translation. Bosley translated a selection as \\"The Kanteletar,\\" published in \\"World's Classics\\" in 1992, and currently out of print. It is an excellent companion to any \\"Kalevala\\" translation, but especially (of course) to Bosley's own. With luck, it will be reprinted sometime soon in the \\"Oxford World's Classics\\".	2004-10-17
US	30081986	R1QRSMKMOVST07	0226105105	169488322	Folktales of Norway (Folktales of the World)	Books	5	24	25	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Not Quite Adults Only	I've owned a copy of this 1964 publication for quite a while; my paperback copy is of the 1973 third printing. It is a personal favorite among a shelf-full of folklore volumes. I no longer remember whether it was an impulse purchase, or I needed it for one or another undergraduate or graduate class, and if so whether it was in Scandinavian Literature, or Germanic Mythology, or Folklore Studies.    And that should give you a clue that Amazon has used guesswork in rating it as suitable for 4 to 8 year olds. (Yes, I've reported / complained about it; maybe, against precedent, this will change soon.)    Not that there aren't stories in here quite suitable for reading to young children; there are some. But the book is heavily weighted with historical and theoretical introductions, and elaborate notes to the stories, many of which are either aimed at adults, or chosen to illustrate traditional beliefs as much as to entertain. The volume was an early entry in the University of Chicago Press \\"Folktales of the World\\" series, well-produced volumes which featured forewords by the distinguished American folklorist Richard Dorson, and were generally edited by specialists from the nations covered. (It was officially number 5; but number 1, Kurt Ranke's \\"Folktales of Germany,\\" did not actually appear until 1966!) Unfortunately, most other volumes in the series seem to be out of print; \\"Folktales of Ireland\\" (Sean O'Sullivan) may be the only other exception.    The editor of this volume, Reidar Christiansen, an important Norwegian folklorist, drew on both earlier published collections and archival sources to illustrate a wide variety of genres of oral narrative in Norwegian tradition. He includes: Historical Legends (#1-#11, with sub-divisions); Legends About Magic and Witchcraft (#12-#20); Legends About Ghosts, the Human Soul, and Shapeshifting (#21-#23, again with sub-divisions); Legends About Spirits of the Sea, Lakes, and Rivers (#24-#30); Legends About Sprits of the Air (#31-#32); Legends About Spirits of Forest and Mountain (#33-#60); Legends About Household Spirits (#61-#66); and, finally, Fictional Folktales (#67-#82). The translation, by Pat Shaw Iversen, is, with some minor exceptions, extremely readable.    Some pieces are anecdotes about supernatural beings, illuminating, but uninspiring if read in bulk for amusement. Some of the legends are extremely well told, and nicely localized in terms of Norwegian landscapes. The concluding portion is made up of first-rate wonder tales, mainly Norwegian variants of international fairy tales, told with unusual complexity and skill, which are closest to what the Amazon age rating would suggest.    It is a rewarding book for adults, and probably for teenagers, and perhaps late pre-teens; anyone buying it for small children will not be so happy with it, with the exception of those comfortable with retelling the tales, or with drawing inspiration from them for your own. (Which is great, if you happen to be a small-scale Tolkien...!)    Some Norwegian folktales, although rarely identified as such, are surprisingly well known. According to my own completely unscientific survey, those which are remembered and recognized by their origin tend to be a couple of anecdotes about Trolls, bridges, and Billy-Goats, which is a shame, given the actual variety and sophistication of the tradition. (Of course, some of the best may tend to be lumped in with their fairly close counterparts elsewhere.) Those who enjoy the present work may wish to turn elsewhere for more stories; the seriously curious will look for more examples of beliefs and legends.    Unhappily, what one will generally find are either retellings or shorter selections, more or less obviously chosen for children, and often directly or indirectly based on existing translations; I will mention one partial exception below. The most nearly comparable collection with which I am familiar is an old George W. Dasent translation, drawn directly from a great nineteenth-century collection by P.C. Asbjornsen and Jorgen Moe, \\"Norske Folke Eventyr.\\" (First edition 1843-44, expanded edition 1852; also given as *Folke-eventyr* and *Folkeeventyr.* My apologies for anglicizing the spelling of Norwegian names at this point, and most other places; I'm not going to trust that everyone else will read this in Unicode!)    The Norwegian original is a long-established classic in its native country. Dasent's translation (1858; expanded 1859; third edition 1888) was known to, and cited by, Tolkien, under its original title of \\"Popular Tales from the Norse.\\"  It was available for decades in an illustrated version from Dover Publications, under the title \\"East o' the Sun & West o' the Moon: Fifty-nine Norwegian Folk Tales from the Collection of Peter Christen Asbjrnsen and Jrgen Moe, With 77 illustrations by Erik Werenskiold, Theodor Kittelsen and Others\\" (1970). The illustrations in the Dover edition -- taken from a 1936 three-volume  edition of \\"Samlede Eventyr\\"   [Collected Fairy Tales] -- varied from almost ethnographic (compare photographs in Janice S. Stewart's \\"The Folk Arts of Norway\\" [1953, 1972; third edition, 1999]), to whimsical, to weird, many displaying some combination of these traits.    The strengths and weaknesses, and distinct character, of the Christiansen/Iversen volume can be illustrated by a brief comparison.    The Victorian translation, stripped by Dover of some of its original (racist, and otherwise quite obsolete) introductory material, has many pieces not found in \\"Folktales of Norway,\\" but there is overlap -- over a dozen instances. In some particulars, Dasent's translation is better than Iversen's renderings of the same passages. For example, in one story (#53a), Iversen has a white animal referred to in the title and in a critical moment as a \\"tabby,\\" which, of course, implies a patterned coat, and in context makes no sense. In this case, Dasent had a more general colloquial term in the text, and a properly incorrect word in his story title. (Sorry to be opaque, but why spoil the tale -- which includes a species identification error beyond even Pepe LePew! -- for those who haven't read it?)    Some differences may be in part due to variations in the underlying Norwegian texts (subjected to varying treatment since they were taken down in regional dialects), others to Iversen's attempts to provide completely new renderings. On the whole, Iversen's judgment seems sound. \\"The Red Knight\\" is much more intelligible a designation than Dasent's \\"Ritter Red,\\" which, by incorporating an un-translated title (that looks like a loan-word from German), makes it sound like a personal name.    The nineteenth-century collection is obviously weighted very heavily toward the (Norwegian) title category of \\"eventyr\\" -- essentially the familiar \\"fairy tales\\" of princesses and unlikely heroes, talking animals and magical helpers, known throughout the Old World. They are rendered in a style closer to Icelandic sagas than, say, to Perrault, or even the Grimms, and, although not treated in a strictly \\"scientific\\" manner by their collectors/editors, are utterly distinct from Hans Christian Andersen's contemporary inventions.    Some of the stories translated by Dasent incidentally include distinctly Norwegian material, but this is comparatively scarce -- ironic, given Dasent's interest in England's supposed shared Nordic heritage and the genius of the \\"Germanic race.\\" The contents are mainly variants of widely distributed tale-types. It is in part for the localized legends and specifically Norwegian versions of the supernatural (which Asbjornsen, among others, had published separately) that \\"\\"Folktales of Norway\\" is so valuable.    Iversen's more modern English *might* make stories in the final section easier for some readers. On the whole, Dasent's translation, although a bit old-fashioned, does lend itself to reading to children -- if the adult is familiar with the story first, and exercises a little judgment. (Dasent warned against some items, especially two he moved to the end when re-ordering the collection; he also seems to have omitted at least one tale. My list of possible problems would be completely different.) More advanced young readers, with appetites sharpened by, for example, Tolkien, Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, or Rowling, might want to tackle it for themselves -- which I would consider less likely, although hardly impossible, with \\"Folktales of Norway.\\"    Unhappily, the 400-plus page Dover edition, with its wonderful Norwegian illustrations, has been supplanted by a less expensive, but much less satisfactory, short selection (\\"Thrift Edition\\"), under the same main title, in the Dover catalogue. The full version can still be found on Amazon, at this writing, with a little searching; it is, and should continue to be, available used. But the hardcover edition to which Amazon currently has it linked is one of the more dramatically abridged modern editions (a new illustrated version of what looks like one story!). If it were not for the possibility of confusion among these different books, I might have urged ordering both Dasent and Christiansen -- but then, I'm used to thinking of the 1970s prices of the copies in front of me! -- or suggesting them both to your local library.    As it is, the next best alternative to the Dasent translation currently (and unambiguously) in print is the much shorter (192 pages) \\"Norwegian Folktales\\" in The Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library (1982), thirty-five tales selected from the work of Asbjornsen and Moe, edited by Iversen (again) and Carl Norman. This also includes illustrations by Werenskiold and Kittelsen: the introduction is on \\"The Norwegian Folk Tales and Their Illustrators.\\" As previously suggested, it is at least packaged as suitable for children; for what it is worth, Amazon rates it for ages 9-12. I am perhaps too severe a judge of its merits; my choice of stories for re-translation wouldhave been rather different, and I have sometimes wondered if some tales were selected over others because of more attractive illustrations available for them.    (Speaking of illustrations again, I have long tried to ignore the pseudo-Viking stereotypes on the cover of \\"Folktales of Norway\\" -- accepting the art was an unusually bad decision by the University of Chicago Press.)    Those with an informed interest in traditional oral literatures will certainly want to know \\"Folktales of Norway,\\" and at least for now it seems to be quite readily available.	2004-10-07
US	30081986	R1Q16CMYKJHH83	014043111X	203953852	The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia (Penguin English Library)	Books	5	64	67	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Multiple Identities and Versions	&#34;The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia&#34; is a book that has been in and out of fashion for about four centuries. It is a story of disguised princes, an impersonated princess, infatuated shepherds, and gender and identity confusions on a rather large scale, all set in a strikingly English version of ancient Greece. It was written in a mixture of prose and verse by the Elizabethan courtier, Sir Philip Sidney (1554-1586), beginning in 1579, supposedly to amuse his sister, Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke. (Hence the book's title; the Sidney family itself was recent upper-gentry rather than old nobility, but the received title may have been as much a selling point for the original publisher as personal snobbery.) It seems in fact to have been part of an ambitious project for elevating English, a second- or third-rate language in a Europe dominated by literature in Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish.  It was a key text for English society in the seventeenth century, and received a variety of political and cultural readings -- a long story in itself, involving King Charles I and John Milton, among others. Although Sidney had offered himself as a champion of Elizabeth's officially Calvinist Church, some Puritans tended to find both poetry and fiction at best a distraction, at worst a threat, and the &#34;Arcadia&#34; combined them; not to mention the erotic element. The resulting debate over the &#34;Arcadia,&#34; transferred from theological-moral to aesthetic frames of reference, continues; for some critics, liking this book is itself a Bad Thing. Of course, there are those who simply don't like it; nothing appeals to every taste.  As originally published in 1590, it was a fragment, in two and a half books, breaking off in mid-story (Book III, Chapter 29), where the author left his revisions when he went to the Netherlands, and his death fighting the Spanish, in a self-assumed role as the Protestant Knight-Errant. (There is an on-line version of this text, in theoriginal spelling, transcribed by Risa Bear, at Renascence Editions.) Its publication came near the beginning of several decades of staggering importance in English literature, which included Christopher Marlowe's major works, and those of Shakespeare, Spenser, Ben Jonson, and John Donne, among others.  The 1593 edition, in five books, was more complete, with a conclusion presented as being drawn from an earlier draft, edited to conform to Sidney's alterations. This was undoubtedly true, for, even if no other evidence had survived, the handling of these texts gave rise to a dispute between the Countess and one of her fellow editors, and the additions did not quite join with the previously printed section, leaving plot-lines dangling. (This version, likewise in Elizabethan spelling, was formerly available as an e-book from Kessinger; in that edition, the gap is on page 453.) Later printings included one or another (or both) of two more-or-less authorized bridge passages, linking up the unfinished original part of Sidney's revised and expanded narrative to the old conclusion. (There was a 1983 facsimile edition of the 1598 printing, from Scholars' Facsimiles and Reprints, apparently still available.) The original &#34;old&#34; version was later assumed to be lost, with Sidney's manuscripts.  This 1593 version of the work has been edited twice in recent years. First, by Maurice Evans, as &#34;The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia,&#34; now in the Penguin Classics series (included 1987; originally for the Penguin English Library, 1977), for the general reader, complete with the longer of the two &#34;bridge&#34; sections, and useful, but limited, notes. Second, by Victor Skretkowicz, as &#34;The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia (The New Arcadia),&#34; a critical edition from Oxford University Press (1987), more useful for scholars and students, but probably less attractive to others. The Penguin version is probably the more widely read of the two, and, having read and referred to it for over twenty-five years, I think that it will serve the interested reader well for most purposes. (Beyond the great advantage of being in print....)  Besides the semi-offical bridge passages, other hands offered supplements and sequels to the 1593 version, some of which have recently come in for new attention. The series &#34;Women Writers in English 1350-1850&#34; includes &#34;A Continuation of Sir Philip Sidney's *Arcadia*&#34; by Anna Weamys, edited by Patrick Colborn Cullen (1994); this represents a mid-seventeenth-century Royalist reading. An interesting critical approach is offered by Elizabeth A. Spiller in &#34;Speaking for the Dead: King Charles, Anna Weamys, and the Commemorations of Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia,&#34; available on-line.  The book's popularity faded in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly with the rise of the modern novel as a preferred type of narrative fiction. Although it still had some readers and admirers, the romantic essayist and critic William Hazlitt called it &#34;one of the great monuments of the abuse of intellectual power.&#34; Hazlitt's antipathy was in part a legitimate reaction to types of prose and verse he found overblown, in part a sign of a chronological cultural gap; the temporal equivalent of despising foreign literatures as being, well, so foreign.  Sidney was one of the key figures of the &#34;English Renaissance&#34; -- the (by European standards) delayed flowering of literature in England in the 1580s and 1590s (and several decades thereafter), most of which he didn't live to see, but which he promoted by propaganda and example. An aspect of the &#34;new learning&#34; of the Renaissance which doesn't get a lot of emphasis in standard textbooks was the popularity of the late (Hellenistic and Roman) romance in classical Greek; novels of love and adventure, often involving shepherds, disguised nobles, and lost princesses (or at least missing heiresses). The most widely read example of thisgenre in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was the brief &#34;Daphnis and Chloe&#34; of Longus, but in earlier times there were equal or greater favorites; for example, the long and complex adventure story, &#34;Aethiopica&#34; by Heliodorus (first English translation by Thomas Underdowne, 1587). Their Renaissance vogue produced a series of imitations across Europe, most notably Jacopo Sannazaro's &#34;Arcadia&#34; (1502) and Jorge de Montemayor's &#34;La Diana&#34; (1558?). These were themselves international sensations; Sidney was trying to bring English literature into the (for him) modern age, just as, say, Coleridge, was trying to do in his day -- or Hazlitt, for that matter.  Maybe Sidney's example had nothing to do with the appearance of Spenser or Shakespeare as major poets; but Spenser certainly didn't think so, and some of Shakespeare's plays show every sign of being aimed at an audience that had enjoyed and absorbed the &#34;Arcadia&#34; and its various lesser imitators.  Beginning in 1909, the situation was complicated by the rediscovery (by Bertram Dobell) of manuscript copies of what came to be known to scholars as the &#34;Old Arcadia&#34; -- the complete first version, very differently arranged, with some different characterizations of the protagonists. It was not actually &#34;lost,&#34; just ignored. This shorter, simpler, &#34;unpublished&#34; work, although not printed, turns out to have had a fair circulation among the Elizabethan elite, in a sort of ruling-class *samizdat*. First printed in 1926, as part of a multi-volume edition of Sidney's works, it was acclaimed by some critics -- including its editor, Albert Feuillerat -- as the true, preferred, version. Sidney's extensive revisions were dismissed as an abandoned experiment in unfortunate elaboration, and the 1593 edition as a sad botch, a pieced-together work without artistic merit.  Others -- notably C.S. Lewis -- championed the 1593 &#34;New&#34; Arcadia as that closest to the author's considered intent, and a work of actual historical importance. In this view, Sidney's most radical change -- opening in the middle of the action, and using his original first part as an inset story, or &#34;flashback&#34; -- was a serious attempt at classicism, modeled on Homer, Virgil, and Heliodorus, not a product of muddled thinking. Editors of anthologies and volumes of &#34;selected works&#34; have often resorted to providing selections from both redactions.  The &#34;Old Arcadia&#34; was critically re-edited by Jean Robertson for Oxford University Press in 1973 as &#34;The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia (The Old Arcadia),&#34; and, again, in a popular edition, edited by Katherine Duncan-Jones for the World's Classics (Oxford University Press, 1985; with new bibliography, 1994); for some reason, this out-of-print edition currently appears on Amazon with an image of a volume of Jonathan Swift(!).  The Duncan-Jones text was reprinted in 1999 in the re-designed Oxford World's Classics series, and this version is in print (for now). The cover title of this edition is simply &#34;The Old Arcadia,&#34; but Amazon, following the publisher's own web site, lists it as &#34;The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia: The Old Arcadia&#34; (and variations). Both are, of course, legitimate, but this is a little confusing.  The [Oxford] World's Classics &#34;Old Arcadia&#34; is a good companion to the Penguin &#34;New Arcadia&#34; -- and I am not going to take sides on which of Sidney's versions is &#34;better.&#34;  [Addendum, March 2015: I'd almost forgotten I'd written this review, so I'm rather late in adding the information that, as of 2013, there is a Kindle edition (for Kindle devices *and* Kindle apps for Mac, PC, and smartphones) from Delphi of &#34;Sir Philip Sidney: Complete Works.&#34; This includes texts of both the &#34;Old Arcadia&#34; and the &#34;New Arcadia&#34; (sources unspecified), and other prose works, such as one of the two versions of his &#34;Apologiefor Poetry,&#34; as well as all of his poetry. It is an inexpensive way to make Sidney's acquaintance, although the use of Elizabethan spellings (such as 'u' for 'v'), and the lack of historical and literary notes and a glossary, may make it a frustrating one for novices.]	2004-10-04
US	30081986	RE3BFOHM4KFFJ	0824014103	126819671	Well of the Unicorn	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Confusion Confounded for a Great Book	\\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" was first published by William Sloane Associates in 1948, as by the previously unknown author, George U. Fletcher. It featured a lovely dust jacket, a frontispiece map, and inset maps as chapter headings, the beautiful work of Rafael Palacios, whose maps had graced many other books, including some highly-regarded military histories by Fletcher Pratt. Considerable trouble had obviously been taken to produce the book, and many of its readers eventually would agree that it was worth it --  when they had a chance to see it.<br /><br />A story of revolution and love in a world both like and unlike medieval Europe, it might have reached a wide audience, at least by the pre-Tolkien standards for fantasy. Although highly original in many ways, it acknowledged a debt to Lord Dunsany's play, \\"King Argimenes and the Unknown Warrior,\\" the events of which were supposed to lie in the book's distant past; and it fairly clearly reacted to the vague political and military thinking in E.R. Eddison's \\"The Worm Ouroboros.\\" (As was later pointed out in a fine critical essay by Dave Hulan, \\"Of Worms and Unicorns\\" -- reprinted in \\"The Conan Grimoire\\" [Mirage] and \\"The Spell of Conan\\" [Ace], if you can find copies.)<br /><br />However, in a masterpiece of poor judgment, someone at Sloane had decided that, since the ACTUAL author, Fletcher Pratt, already HAD a major reputation as a military HISTORIAN, his new FANTASY novel should be published under a pen name; something about not confusing readers.<br /><br />This decision also ignored Pratt's *other* reputation as a science fiction and fantasy novelist -- the latter usually in collaboration with L. Sprague de Camp (who later desribed the origin of the pseudonym in several articles and books). Sloane Associates also insisted on a clunking \\"Publisher's Foreword\\" in addition to the \\"Author's Note\\" -- apparently, someone was having second thoughts about a novel of war, politics, love, sex, and magic in a place for which maps had to be invented!. (They might have better asked for revisions in a couple of paragraphs, in which, as de Camp put it, an \\"excess of subtlety\\" can leave readers confused about elapsed time.)<br /><br />As a result, the new book by \\"George U. Fletcher\\" was largely ignored at the time by not one but two groups of readers. Fans of military history, who might have enjoyed Pratt's variations on the lessons pointed out in his non-fiction, had no reason to look at it. Mr. Fletcher was also a complete unknown to those who mourned the loss of \\"Unknown Worlds,\\" the magazine that had published most of Pratt's fantasy in the early 1940s. Pratt (1897-1956) didn't keep his authorship a secret, but this was no great help to people who learned of it after the book was out of print. Pratt's obituary in \\"The New York Times,\\" which did mention his science fiction, described \\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" as \\"straight fiction,\\" which (at best) suggests a guess at its contents. (It now may be necessary to warn against confusion with the group \\"The Fletcher Pratt\\" -- search engines, at least, have trouble with the distinction.)<br /><br />\\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" finally appeared under the author's own name in a Lancer Books paperback in 1968, with a new, intelligent, Introduction by Baird Searles, new cover art (uncredited, but very attractive), and the frontispiece map (not too badly reproduced in the smaller format). Lancer, which was then issuing the Robert E. Howard Conan stories as edited by L. Sprague de Camp, foundered for complex reasons a few years later, and \\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" was again unavailable. In the meantime, it had missed being included in the Ballantine Books Adult Fantasy series, which did include another of Pratt's major fantasy novels, \\"The Blue Star.\\"<br /><br />In 1975, Garland included it in a library-oriented series of high-quality reprintings of classic science fiction and fantasy. They had the good taste to go back to the Sloane edition, reproducing it in full (except for the dust jacket). Unhappily, this edition reverted to the \\"George U. Fletcher\\" pseudonym on the title page and cover, so it was again likely to be missed by anyone looking for books by Pratt. It was also rather expensive (by *1975* standards for science fiction and fantasy), although not unreasonably so; the paper and binding were of far more durable quality than the usual acidic stock.<br /><br />Fortunately, Del Rey Books (the then-recent science fiction and fantasy imprint of Ballantine Books, which had been acquired by Random House) picked up the title in paperback in 1976 -- not a big surprise, because Lester del Rey had been involved in the Garland \\"Library of Science Fiction\\" project. It was back under the author's real name, and included the chapter heading maps (although not the excellent Searles Introduction from the Lancer edition), and dropped the clearly unnecessary Sloane Foreword and its \\"explanation.\\"<br /><br />As originally published, the Del Rey edition had a cover by the Brothers Hildebrandt. This depicts an actual scene from the book quite accurately, but personally I have always thought it discouragingly ugly as a composition. (The Sea Demon is appropriately unpleasant-looking, but that is a different matter.) The frontispiece map was printed on the inside front and back covers, which made for very clear reproduction.<br /><br />An elegant Darrell Sweet cover, showing the major characters in a wilderness landscape, graced the book from the second Del Rey printing (1979) on; in this and later printings, the frontispiece map was again on a regular page. The Sweet cover is the version shown in the current (October 2004) Amazon listing for the Del Rey edition, which is not necessarily what you will get if you order a used copy without checking its date carefully. And, unfortunately, at least for now, it seems that a used copy is what you will have to order, in any American edition. \\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" was most recently reprinted in a British edition in 2001, as part of the Gollancz Fantasy Masterworks series (not seen); this edition can be found on the Amazon.co.uk site, but does not seem to be available (officially) in the U.S.ing it in full (except for the dust jacket).

US	30081986	RSZGYPVHNCL2R	0345297296	126819671	Well of the Unicorn	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Neglected Gem	\\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" should be recognized as one of the outstanding fantasy novels of the first half of the twentieth century, or any other time. It was first published by William Sloane Associates in 1948, as by the previously unknown author, George U. Fletcher, with a dust-jacket and frontispiece and chapter heading maps by the well-known illustrator Rafael Palacios. That edition was reprinted in hardcover (minus the dust jacket) in the Garland Library of Science Fiction in 1975, with the same attribution.    It was in fact the work of Fletcher Pratt (as acknowledged, not very prominently, in the Garland edition). In the late 1940s Pratt (1897-1956; not to be confused with the group \\"The Fletcher Pratt\\"!) was a well-known military historian; several of his works in this field are, or were recently, still in print (including one with Palacios maps). He was also a science fiction and fantasy novelist, alone and in collaboration with L. Sprague de Camp.     When the Garland edition appeared, \\"The Well of the Unicorn\\" already had been published in mass-market paperback under Pratt's name in 1968, by Lancer Books. It was issued again in this format by Del Rey Books in 1976, and, with a new cover, in 1979 -- this last being version currently shown on Amazon. It was most recently published in a British edition in 2001, as part of the Gollancz Fantasy Masterworks series. This edition can be found on the Amazon.co.uk site. It does not seem to be readily available in the U.S., although Amazon lists it from time to time.    I have described the reason (if you can call it that) for the confusing and unnecessary pseudonym, and other details of the publishing history, in a review posted with the Garland edition, which is listed on Amazon, at least for the moment, as by George U. Fletcher. Since \\"Well\\" is now out of print in the United States, in any edition, I suggest checking there for some helpful hints on their differences if you are trying to decide which version of itto order.    With any luck, a U.S. publisher will soon re-issue the beautifully-produced Sloane edition, as a trade paperback, under Pratt's name (perhaps without the original publisher's unnecessary prefatory note). It should be in print, and Palacios' maps deserve the full size (and often higher-quality paper) of such an edition.    Under any author's name, this is an extraordinary example of fantasy, pre- or post-Tolkien. It is adult in tone, very literate, and intentionally thought-provoking. There is plenty of action, and we meet a variety of appealing (and sometimes annoying) characters. Magic plays a part, but has limits, and its solutions don't always match up well with the problems. Pratt has interesting things to say about a number of topics, from sex to politics, not all of them immediately evident, but clear enough when you start looking for them, in the words and actions of minor as well as major characters. Readers of his \\"Ordeal by Fire\\" (otherwise \\"A Short History of the Civil War,\\" and various combined forms of the title) will recognize some elements. So will those familiar with his less readily available book on medieval Denmark, \\"The Third King.\\"    Pratt drew on a vast knowledge of military history and political organizations to get the details right, without going into elaborate explanations. His setting has echoes of medieval Scandinavia (his Dalarna is not the Swedish province, but someplace like it), and of the Hanseatic League, but also the Holy Roman Empire. (Neither called by these names, of course; and Pratt's Empire has rather better claims to being Holy, although not exactly Christian, than its historical counterpart.) There are also, I suspect, a few hints of the history of the Balkans. Off in the distance is a quasi-Islamic empire, the realm of \\"the heathen Dzik,\\" about whom Pratt was planning to write a story, in which, he told his friends, they would have turned out much nicer than reputed by their old enemies.     \\"The Well of theUnicorn\\" is, however, unrelated to Pratt's other major fantasy novel, \\"The Blue Star\\" (in the omnibus \\"Witches Three,\\" 1952; separate editon, 1969) -- at least, the geography and system of magic seem unrelated and incompatible. The actual sequel to \\"Well\\" was one of a number of projects Pratt was planning at the time of his sudden, untimely, death.	2004-10-01
US	30081986	RRA7AL6Q2H10N	073510171X	46715813	The Worm Ouroboros	Books	5	92	96	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Favorite, if Not For Everyone	I adore \\"The Worm Ouroboros.\\" It has flaws, or at least peculiarities, including a fascination with aristocracy and lack of concern for the \\"lower classes\\" rarely expressed so clearly in modern English literature -- perhaps not since the Tudors began eliminating \\"over-mighty subjects,\\" and the Puritans started comparing the godly poor man in his cottage to the ungodly noble in his mansion (or King in his palace!) without regard to the \\"natural\\" order of things. By the 1580s, even Sir Philip Sidney's class-conscious \\"Arcadia\\" paid lip-service to rustic virtues, as Malory, a century before, had not. But not Eddison, over three centuries later.    Some, understandably, find this offensive, but it shouldn't be considered political (regardless of the author's own views). E.R. Eddison's narrative and the Homeric or medieval ethos of the book's characters fit together perfectly; and you can consider their attitude the most realistic feature of the narrative.    And it is quite a story. One of the sub-plots includes riding an unridable beast as a stage in climbing an unclimbable mountain, all of which is part of a side-effort (a rescue) in a struggle to kill an undying enemy.    The book is of a piece; gorgeous language (too much for some tastes), mighty heroes (and their adversaries) in colorful and expensive costumes and decorated armor, spectacular landscapes, weird animals from bestiaries and heraldry, magic gems from lapidaries, and stories from \\"Mandeville's Travels,\\" all fitted together with correspondingly archaic notions of the Good and the Just. Achilles or Lancelot would be at home. So would medieval Norway's eccentric King Magnus Bare-legs, of Scots garb and sayings like \\"Kings are made for glory, not for long life,\\" whom I am almost surprised not to find among the minor characters -- despite the book's arbitrary setting on \\"Mercury\\" (more of an astrological zone than a planet; Mercury as patron of eloquence), which troubles some readers.    And there are the nations of Witches, Demons, Goblins, Imps, and Pixies; names not related to their characteristics -- save that the lords of Demonland seem to have small horns (not mentioned of anyone else), and the late, unlamented, Ghouls were cannibals. One has to get used to thinking in terms of places: people from \\"waterish Witchland\\" and \\"many-mountained Demonland.\\" There is this difference between the main heroes, the Demons, and the main villains, the Witches; the Demons are seen waging wars in defense of themselves and others, the Witches are out for conquest. But they all enjoy a fight; and, again, some lords of Witchland are perfectly decent to other members of the upper class, while the Demonland nobility doesn't seem to notice much how many common soldiers and seamen perish.    Ordinary farming folk going about their tasks do appear, but briefly, and not without a dignifying classical allusion (the Demon song against Corinius is a version of a Greek drinking song against the tyrant Pittacus); this sequence from daily life also suggests a bit of influence from Eddison's beloved Icelandic sagas, which otherwise contribute omens, pithy sayings, and some artifacts.    Magic plays a role -- used mainly by the villains, not so much because it is morally evil, but because it is so dangerous to the user that a more sensible sort of hero might rather take his chances in battle. The protagonists (despite mocking the petty gods of lesser nations), appeal to their thoroughly pagan gods, instead of casting spells -- and sometimes get an answer, at much less risk.    If you are sure you can't get over such issues, or won't be able to abide its elevated, frequently archaic, often Shakespearean, or at least Elizabethan or Jacobean, language, you probably shouldn't bother with the book.    If you think that you might enjoy it, for its high adventure and extravagant imagination, there is the question of what edition to read. It used to be that they were all quite similar, and the best answer was \\"whichever is available.\\" This is no longer true. Both contents and price differ.    Over the years since I first read it 1967, I've become familiar with a number of editions. These include: the 1922 Jonathan Cape edition, the 1952 E.P. Dutton second American edition, with Orville Prescott's Introduction added to that by James Stephens for the 1926 American edition, and the 1962 trade paperback reprint of this in Crown's Xanadu Library (all three identical except the added front-matter); the 1967 Ballantine mass-market paperback, reset from the Dutton edition, with Barbara Remington's cover art (and some of its nine later reprintings), plus a 1975 copy of the 1971 Pan/Ballantine British edition, and the 1977 and 1981 Del Rey/Ballantine tenth and twelfth printings, on which the older Ballantine cover was replaced with a less attractive one by Murray Tinkelman (originally in green, later in yellow); and, finally, the 1991 re-set edition from Dell, annotated by Paul Edmund Thomas, with a cover of characters and beasties interpreted by Tim Hildebrandt.    (The Hildebrandt cover is, typically, \\"realistic\\" -- posed-looking, including studio lighting. I much prefer the crowded, chaotic Remington cover, with its stylized mountains and sea, monsters, ships, and contending armies, and the titular tail-biting serpent, a symbol of eternity, as a frame which intrudes into the landscape.  It is recognizably related to Remington's then-recent triptych of covers for Ballantine's \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" although fortunately far more consistent with the spirit of Eddison's book than those were with Tolkien's. She did an equally good job, in a slightly different style, with the Ballantine 1967-1969 editions of Eddison's three \\"Zimiamvia\\" novels, \\"Mistress of Mistresses,\\" \\"A Fish Dinner in Memison,\\" and \\"The Mezentian Gate,\\" catching their High Medieval/Renaissance flavor.)    Although I have some quibbles, and a few major objections, to Thomas's annotations, and to certain omissions, this last is a highly desirable edition, a delight to Eddison's fans, and a resource to those who might be, if they could catch his layered allusions (he often incorporated quotations -- some medieval and adapted, some *literally* sixteenth or seventeenth century English) and follow his frantically rich vocabulary. (Thomas also edited Dell's \\"Zimiamvia: A Trilogy\\" omnibus.)    If you are a first-timer, though, it should be remembered that a lot of very literate and intelligent people seem to find Eddison unreadable, even with assistance. You might be one of them. With this in mind, a library copy might be the best start, if available, or an inexpensive used copy of the much-reprinted Ballantine edition (or its rather scarcer Del Rey avatar). I will describe third and fourth options at the end.    The main down side of the Dell trade paperback edition (besides it being out of print, alas!) is that it was the first I know of not to contain the full set of illustrations and chapter decorations by Keith Henderson. Although these vary in quality (and Ballantine's less than intense printing  of sharp blacks was not helpful), they were approved by the author, and form a part of his image of the book. (They also have a fascinating relationship to Henderson's roughly contemporary illustrations to a lavish edition of another story of exotic adventure, Prescott's \\"Conquest of Mexico;\\" a selection of these were reprinted in \\"The Fall of the Aztec Empire\\" in 1993.)    In what may have been a production oversight, rather than an editorial decision, it also lacks the ballad excerpt that should serve as an epigram (see under the Kessinger reprint, below).    Some of the later reprintings by other firms seem to have followed the same assumption that the illustrations could be partly or completely eliminated; a circumstance that makes the 1999 Replica Books edition (hardcover and trade paperback), based directly on the British first edition, particularly attractive. The (British)Millennium Fantasy Masterworks edition of 2002, although possibly reset, and also lacking the American multiple introductions, MAY have ALL the art, and, if available, should be less expensive. I also have yet to see the 2004 American edition from Wildside.    At the opposite extreme from the Replica edition in hardcover is the similarly-priced (!) Kessinger reprint (and its very inexpensive E-Book version, with the same pagination), which not only drops the illustrations -- and the layers of introductions to the American editions -- but in resetting the text also drops the opening epigram, and the appended material Eddison provided for the reader. A mood-setting selection from the ballad of \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\" should open the book; it is missing from the Kessinger text, as in the Dell edition, for no apparent reason. (Copyright infringement on Sir Walter Scott's version of the text is unlikely to be a problem!)    Eddison's main appendix, the \\"Argument with Dates\\" organizes the considerable amount  of back-story offered in widely scattered places throughout the book, and incidentally demonstrates how Eddison had worked out travel times, relative ages of characters, and other details, all in a few pages. It too is gone, which is sure to give some readers the impression that Eddison's \\"art that conceals art\\" is actually just confusion.    The \\"Bibliographical Note on the Verses,\\" which identifies most (not quite all) of Eddison's wide-ranging borrowings of English and Greek verse literature (and specifies the translation of the Icelandic saga read aloud in the \\"Induction,\\" but not the many echoes of other prose) may not be missed by some, but being able to find some of the (mainly) sixteenth and seventeenth century poetry he incorporated into his created world is helpful, and it is likewise gone without a trace. Even worse, this may give some better-informed readers the impression that Eddison was trying to claim credit for literary borrowings he in fact carefully acknowledged. Indeed, Eddison was more than ordinarily scrupulous; he went so far as to specify the variant readings he used in one of the poems.    The Kessinger E-Book is also littered with new and original misprints, which sometimes make Eddison's classical allusions rather difficult to recognize; I assume that this was generated from the same digital version used for the publisher's hard copy edition, which should have the same flaws. However, the e-book is so inexpensive, and the digital form so convenient for searches, that, for now, I am as delighted with it as child with a new toy. *IF* you don't mind reading a computer screen for long stretches (I do), this may not be a bad place to start. (You will need Adobe Reader 6.x or above to view it; and, even aside from the length, forget about printing it; the file is locked.)     Finally, if you are (as is most likely) reading this on-line, you can check a hypertext version of the 1922 edition on the web  -- see the Internet Sacred Text Archive, under Tolkien-related material. This is admirable, but, again, hundreds of pages on a monitor are a  more than a bit hard to read (at least for me), and connection speed could be a problem. You can certainly use it as a sampler, to determine if you are interested. Also, the site offers a CD-ROM of a huge collection of material, including \\"Worm,\\" and many texts relevant to it (particularly Norse and alchemical), at an extremely attractive price. (Its new 4.0 edition should eventually be available through Amazon.) The site itself includes helpful links.    I am classing the e-book and hypertext versions as third and fourth convenient ways to find out if you like this long book, which some find impossible to read, and others rewarding enough to read over and over.	2004-09-20
US	30081986	R3KZRXHHAON3E6	0140441530	566007210	Lives of the Saints (Classics)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Replaced by a Re-Titled Expansion	This now long-out-of-print collection was first published in 1962; my copy is a 1975 printing, and Amazon lists a 1981 printing (by which time Viking had merged with Penguin). It is sometimes listed as \\"Lives of Saints,\\" sometimes as  \\"Lives of the Saints\\" -- I am not certain if this reflects changes in the cover title in different printings over a twenty-year period, since my copy has \\"the Saints\\" on the spine, covers, and title page. In either case, it  was replaced in the Penguin Classics in 1983 by an expanded edition, edited by D.H. Farmer under the new title of \\"The Age of Bede,\\" which included considerable new material, and was itself expanded in 1998; I have reviewed all three versions under the \\"Age of Bede\\" title, and offer a summary here.    This original form, edited and translated by J.F. Webb, contained the *The Voyage of St. Brendan,* Bede's *Life of Cuthbert* (from the prose version), and the *Life of Wilfrid,* by Eddius Stephanus. All are translated from Latin. The first is a legendary account of the supposed sea voyages of an actual Irish abbot, and was one of the most popular works of the Middle Ages. The Venerable Bede's account of St. Cuthbert was commissioned by a monastic community devoted to his memory (Lindisfarne), and is based mainly on an earlier anonymous *Life,* which Bede himself had previously adapted in verse, and had drawn on for a much less miraculous account of its hero in his \\"History of the English Church and People\\" (the title of the old Penguin translation by Leo Sherley-Price: currently offered revised and expanded, as \\"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\\" -- see below). This complicated redaction history is not unusual, but for once we know that three of the versions came from the same hand. The *Life of Wilfrid* is a partisan account, by one of his followers, of a Northumbrian bishop who somehow managed to have almost as many disputes with his friends as with his enemies. (Bede also deals with Wilfrid in his \\"History,\\" with considerably less enthusiasm than Eddius shows.)        This version of the collection had considerable internal coherence, as it illustrated the variety of literature found under the heading of \\"Lives of the Saints,\\" and various roles as edifying entertainment, institutional piety, and partisan propaganda. The three texts are also roughly contemporary, and, as should be clear, reflect Irish and British traditions of hagiography. *The Voyage of St. Brendan,* a charming and influential story of voyages among supernatural islands, which leads the collection in this version, remains the most likely to interest general readers, although it was later moved to the end of the volume. (See my \\"Age\\" review for its literary importance, including its use by Tolkien.) Webb's translation was not the first into English, but it was the first to have available Carl Selmer's still-definitive 1959 edition of the Latin text, based on 18 of the 120 surviving manuscripts Selmer had traced. (For those unfamiliar with medieval literature, this is an extraordinary number of copies, even though it is a short work.) Although it assumes a considerable knowledge of Irish hagiography (particularly an earlier \\"Life of Brendan\\") and topography, the *Voyage* seems to have been written on the continent. It is thought to be by an expatriate Irish monk in one of the several important monasteries established by Irish monks abroad, as a form of \\"white martyrdom\\" (exile from the homeland), in which the idea of Brendan as a voyager for Christ would have had special appeal.    D.H. Farmer's expanded edition as \\"The Age of Bede\\" changed the focus more heavily to Anglo-Saxon England by adding Bede's *Lives of the Abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow,* as well as shifting the position of the Irish *Brendan.* The most recent expansion includes an anonymous *Life* of an additional English Abbot, Ceolfrith, who was a contemporary of Bede.    In my review under the \\"Age of Bede\\" title, I concluded that, since the latest version has the widest range of material, and is the most up-to-date, the original \\"Lives of the Saints,\\" although fine reading, is probably not the best bargain -- particularly if you are using it for any serious study of medieval culture. Unless you need the recently added *Life of Ceolfrith* for a class, the earlier versions of \\"The Age of Bede\\" (1983, slightly revised 1988) may be acceptable. If I was starting fresh, however, I'd prefer the current (1998) edition, with its revised introduction, updated bibliography (\\"For Further Reading\\"), and, of course, an additional text, not readily available in translation elsewhere.    However, if you are merely curious, and the price its right, I would not discourage anyone from going ahead with purchasing a copy of \\"Lives.\\" Webb's very readable translations cover the most purely entertaining contents. My 1975 copy even has a very appropriate cover illustration; not just any illumination from a medieval manuscript, but \\"Athelstan presenting the Book to St. Cuthbert to Bede, by an unknown master of the Winchester School.\\"    Just remember that Webb's introductory material is now very much out of date.    I will also add that, like the previously-mentioned 1955 translation of Bede's \\"Ecclesiastical History\\" for Penguin by Leo Sherley-Price (\\"A History of the English Church and People\\"), the tone of Webb's volume is clearly, although not heavily, Christian. (Webb was himself a Catholic priest.) The \\"Lives\\" are treated as expressions of piety, which is what they were in their own times. Revisions  (1968, 1990), with additional material, of Sherley-Price's translation, by R.E. Latham and, most recently, by D.H. Farmer, have been both more academic and more secular (historical and cultural) in their approaches, and similar differences are found in the introduction of Farmer's \\"Age of Bede.\\"	2004-09-14

Briggs' several academic works on English folklore in Tudor and Stuart literature (&#34;The Anatomy of Puck,&#34; 1959; &#34;Pale Hecate's Team,&#34; 1962; now out of print, although there were expensive &#34;Selected Works&#34; reprintings in 2002). I remembered it with pleasure, and wished that it were still available.  Some years later I was fortunate enough to see and buy a copy of the 1972 Puffin edition (the Penguin Books children's imprint), complete with Scoular Anderson's evocative illustrations, when it was reprinted in 1976  -- coinciding with the publication of Brigg's excellent &#34;An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Bogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures.&#34; (This does seem to be in print, and is both easy to read and authoritative; in British editions, it is &#34;A Dictionary of Fairies.&#34; Brigg's &#34;The Fairies in Tradition and Literature&#34; (1967) carries the story into the twentieth century, and likewise currently is in print.)  The Puffin paperback seems to have had a limited distribution (including unofficial imports)  in the U.S., but there was a Harper (now HarperCollins) Greenwillow edition in the U.S. the following year, when the &#34;Encyclopedia&#34; was clearly a success. This edition often can be found in (or through) libraries. So far as the United States is concerned, that seems to be it. (I would be glad to learn otherwise.)  &#34;Hobberdy Dick&#34; has, so far as I know, always been marketed as for children, but in my experience adult readers of fantasy find it at least enjoyable, and certainly worth the time it takes to read it. The main complaint I heard from those to whom I recommended it in the 1970s was &#34;too short.&#34; Briggs (1898-1980) was a distinguished as a folklorist and a literary historian; her learning gives the book a solid foundation, but the abundant detail enriches an engaging story without smothering it.  The main plot could have been a fairly conventional Romeo-and-Juliet re-tread, set in the aftermath of the English Civil War; *She* is from a dispossessed Cavalier family, *He* is the heir of a Parliament Man. But the story is seen largely through the eyes of the title character, a household spirit, or &#34;hob.&#34; Hobberdy Dick is one of class of spirits who protect a place and its inhabitants, giving aid to the diligent and tormenting the slothful and slovenly until they mend their ways. (They are also known, among other names, as &#34;lobs,&#34; and, more widely, at least until the term was trivialized, &#34;brownies.&#34;) The more energetic hobs may intervene to aid the humans of whom they approve in larger ways; and Hobberdy Dick favors happy endings.  In 1652, Dick's home -- complete with its ghost, as well as the hob -- is taken over by disbelieving Puritans from London, who bought the estate when the last known (male) heir died. The new owner and his family start as caricatures, but are quickly fleshed out. (Well, not the additional ghost they inadvertently bring with them, to Hobberdy Dick's even greater annoyance; but the resourceful hob finds a use even for it.) Dick's basic loyalties are to the place, to the children, and to the impoverished young gentlewoman who is hired to attend the new mistress. But even an annoyed hob comes to see that the newcomers may have significant virtues to go with more objectionable qualities. Rigid scruples can be real scruples, even when property is at issue; a matter of some interest to a hob whose duties include guarding a buried hoard....  Hobberdy Dick himself has a wide acquaintance among other local spirits of the hearth and countryside, most of them benign, a few potentially dangerous,all brought to life from a variety of period books and modern folklore studies. These are solitary types; the &#34;trooping fairies,&#34; the inhabitants of the fairy hills, are present, but kept off-stage. A witch makes a passing appearance, practicing real seventeenth-century magic (Briggs elsewhere published the text of the ritual), to the alarm and dismay of the local hobs and boggarts, and the rage of a genuinely impressive Church Grim. The calendar customs and immemorial (even in the 1650s) practices of the English countryside provide a chronological framework, with political events and other disasters like epidemics (a fair equation in the book's terms) a rumor in the distance.  There have been several British editions since the 1970s, including one, from Jane Nissen Books, with both the Anderson illustrations and a new introduction, in 2000; it received admiring reviews, and apparently is in print.  There is even an animated version, apparently in German (or at least described on German websites, where the detailed descriptions are a set of &#34;spoilers&#34;), so it has hardly dropped into obscurity.  But it does not seem to have been readily available in the U.S. for a good many years. All in all, a treasure that should not stay lost for American readers.	2004-09-09
US	30081986	R1Q2BR44YLTEE9	1857987675	51743595	Lud-In-The-Mist (Millennium Fantasy Masterworks)	Books	5	132	135	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Fine New Harvest Reaches the Marches	\\"Lud-in-the-Mist\\" was first published, to both some incomprehension and some critical success, in the 1920s. It opens with, as an epigraph, a reflection by the author's friend and sometime-collaborator, the classicist Jane Ellen Harrison, on the otherwise inexpressible longings revealed in myth. The setting is the land of Dorimare, which is certainly not England, but is something like it; just as the seaport of Lud-in-the-Mist is not exactly London in the Fog. For one thing, England never had such remarkably *interesting* neighbors as does Dorimare -- at least not across any merely geographical border. Not that the solid, and increasingly stolid, burghers of Lud have any intention of acknowledging Fairyland or its inhabitants. That nonsense was all done away with in a glorious (but not The Glorious) Revolution, by their brave, revered, but (now) embarrassingly enthusiastic, ancestors, who chased the last Duke, and the Priests, off to -- well somewhere over the border.    The story is, among other things: a cold-case murder mystery, with a play-by-the-rules solution worthy of John Dickson Carr or Dorothy Sayers; a psychological drama of self-discovery and generational conflict; a critique of British middle-class culture, including an aesthetic defense of aristocracy, ceremony and (by implication, or historical association) Roman Catholicism, against drab and (also by implication) Puritanical commercial modernity; and, above all, one of the finest adaptations of British fairy lore I have seen, effortlessly including in its scope medieval and Elizabethan versions, modern folklore, and even academic interpretations.    Oh yes -- there is also the matter of that forbidden Fruit, or in strict legal terms in Dorimare, since the stuff, officially speaking, doesn't really exist, those illegally imported textiles.    Obviously, some genuine issues are engaged, but never in a heavy-handed manner; they give a little weight to what might otherwise be a frothy and inconsequentialstory about madwomen dancing, and dead men harvesting the fields of fairyland. The book invites applications, but needs none. There are, as indicated, resemblances to English history. But there are too many differences to read it as an allegory (or as taking a position for or against a specific religion, rather than an attitude toward life), instead of what Tolkien called a sub-creation.    The names of the characters (both major ones, like the Mayor, Nathaniel Chanticleer, and Doctor Endymion Leer, and such minor figures as Professor Wisp, Ambrosine Pyepowders, and Miss Primrose Crabapple) are a mixture of real, if sometimes odd or overblown, English names, often Biblical or classical, and interesting variations on them. At least one family seems to have thought that anything medieval-sounding was not only old but impressive -- even if the family name comes from beast-fables, and is rather less dignified than they might like to think it.    The language of the characters is mostly rather nineteenth-century (including some memorable euphemistic \\"oaths\\" which aren't actually Victorian, but should have been). There are some indication of social rank by speech level; but no lapses into \\"comical\\" rusticisms or cockneyisms for no other purpose than amusing the reader. Some of the \\"old\\" or \\"traditional\\" verse and prose quoted  or read by characters in the book is authentic sixteenth and seventeenth-century literature, some is adapted, and some is original; but the joins are seamless (at least to the eyes of this English major), and their presence lends a sense of layered history and culture.    New readers consistently have greeted it with enthusiasm; many of those who like the book seem, indeed, to love it. But, for some reason, it seems that it has to be rediscovered -- in its own terms, brought back from over the Debatable Hills and through the Elfin Marches -- every few decades. (Actually, its obscurity in Britain during the grim 1930s, 1940s and 1950s is easy enoughto understand; it is the need to seek out used copies in the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s, after the book's revival in the 1970s, which I still find surprising. The existence of an ASCII text on-line since 1993 -- an admirable thing in itself -- has not been a real substitute.)    At the moment \\"Lud-in-the-Mist\\" seems to be doing unusually well (may it long continue!). There was a North Books hardcover edition in the Twelve-Point series in 1998, followed by a Millennium Fantasy Masterworks paperback edition in Britain (Gollancz, 2000; with a cover too mysterious to be misleading, but too dramatic to be quite accurate, and an introduction by Neil Gaiman). Currently available are American hardcover and paperback editions from Wildside Press (2002; with a tasteful Pre-Raphaelite cover, John Everett Millais' \\"Ferdinand Lured by Ariel\\"). A German translation (by Hannes Riffel) was just published, as \\"Flucht ins Feenland\\" (2004; with a lovely, if too insectile, vision of fairyland for the cover); it includes an epilogue by Michael Swanwick, on Hope Mirrlees and her work. And back in the U.S., a Cold Spring Press paperback is scheduled for April 2005. An abundance of Fairy Fruit, after too long an embargo. (And if you don't know what *that* means, well, you haven't yet read the book; I can't imagine anyone who has forgetting it.)    I am familiar with three older editions. These are: the original W. Collins Sons edition (London, 1926), examined briefly, but intently, shortly after reading the first paperback edition; the mass-market paperback Ballantine Adult Fantasy version (dated March 1970) which reintroduced it to the world, with an enthusiastic, but uninformative, introduction by Lin Carter, and a lovely scene-setting wraparound cover of the town and the rivers, by Gervasio Gallardo; and the second Ballantine printing (after the company had been acquired by Random House, as A Del Rey Book, dated August 1977), dropping the introduction and the Adult Fantasy label, andwith a cheerful, and accurate, cover by Michael Herring, portraying Mayor Chanticleer (but I prefer Gallardo's).    I have not seen the Pan-Ballantine reprinting of 1972, in which the book (reportedly) returned to print in Britain by way of its American revival, nor examined in detail the more recent British and American editions, but I am going to assume that no one has tampered with the text, or subjected it to garbling in reprinting, and on that basis give them my whole-hearted endorsement. (Information on the German translation can be found at Amazon Germany, and elsewhere.)    For those who are curious about the author, there is a limited amount of information, much the most interesting of which has been researched by Michael Swanwick. From my own work with older published sources, I was aware that Helen Hope Mirrlees (1887-1978) collaborated with Jane Harrison on translations from Russian (one of which, the 50-page autobiography of the Arch-Priest Avvakum, was anthologized -- in re-edited form -- in Zenkovsky's \\"Medieval Russia's Epics, Chronicles, and Tales,\\" in print in various editions since 1963). She was listed as the author of two earlier novels, both reflecting a cultural interest in Catholicism, \\"Madeleine -- One of Life's Jansenists\\" (1921; not seen), and \\"The Counterplot\\" (1924, with a small American edition from Knopf in 1925), both long out of print. A book of verse also was published. Her announced biography of Jane Ellen Harrison never appeared, and books on Harrison's life and career were ultimately written by others, after Mirrlees' death (to the accompaniment of complaints about her failure to produce it, and her handling of the materials).    Although the 1920s encompassed most of her known works, in 1962, Faber & Faber published a \\"A Fly in Amber: Being an Extravagant Biography of the Romantic Antiquary Sir Robert Bruce Cotton,\\" covering part of the life and times of a seventeenth-century collector who saved, among other things, the unique manuscripts of \\"Beowulf\\" and \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\\" (For English majors, Sir Robert is the *Cotton* in the \\"Cotton Manuscripts\\" -- his habit of putting busts of Roman Emperors on his bookcases accounts for  such odd-looking catalogue designations as \\"Cotton Caligula\\" or \\"Cotton Vitellius.\\")    Mirrlees, who had been associated with the \\"Bloomsbury Group\\" (Leonard and Virginia Woolf, who published the \\"Avvakum\\" volume, T.S. Eliot, etc.), is said to have withdrawn from public life soon after Jane Harrison's death in 1928.  However, she seems to have given at least a brief interview about T.S. Eliot some time in, apparently, the 1960s; a very short segment in which she describes one of \\"Tom's\\" marriages appeared on a British documentary, aired in the US on Public Television in the early 1970s, which I happened to catch.	2004-09-03

In this &#34;handmaiden&#34; she translated the &#34;fragments&#34; -- actually quotations in texts by other, later, writers, although a few physical fragments have turned up on papyri -- as they were presented in the then most-recent edition of a classic of scholarship, the fifth edition of H. Diels' &#34;Fragmente der Vorsokratiker.&#34; (Which, for those who haven't guessed, was one of the monuments of late-nineteenth-century German classical studies.)<br /><br />The translation was severely plain, and seems to have pretty much avoided any but the most basic interpretation -- that of vocabulary and grammar (which can get pretty controversial for this material!). She was not the first to translate most of these passages in one place (Burnet's 1892 &#34;Early Greek Philosophy,&#34; and its revisions, included a great many), but her work was both exceptionally comprehensive, and when published, up-to-date; the title of &#34;Ancilla&#34; indicated, to those familiar with the word, that it was intended to assist.<br /><br />The book was originally published as part of a set, along with &#34;The Pre-Socratic Philosophers: A Companion to Diels, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker,&#34; which is now out of print. It was obviously intended as a supplemental reader, to be used with one of the many books on the history of Greek philosophy (not necessarily Freeman's &#34;Companion.&#34;) There is not even a clear statement of the rationale for segregating this extremely diverse group as all characterized by being predecessors to Socrates. (Although, in fact, some seem to have been his younger contemporaries....) Nietzsche, who, early in his short career as a classical philologist, did an important study of one of the major late-classical sources, suggested calling them &#34;Pre-Platonic.&#34; This is actually more helpful; what they most clearly have in common is that Plato's works are the first such to survive &#34;in bulk,&#34; and their writings reach us only in snippets. Traditional usage prevailed, with Diels, with Freeman, and everyone else.<br /><br />The &#34;Ancilla&#34; was restricted to Diels' &#34;B&#34; texts, those he regarded as certainly or likely to be the actual words of the men to whom they were attributed. The much more voluminous &#34;A&#34; texts, the biographical, descriptive, and anecdotal &#34;Testimonies,&#34; were excluded (Freeman dealt with them in &#34;Companion&#34;). Freeman's was a modest-looking but difficult project, carried out to the satisfaction of many classicists -- although every specialist, of course, found something to object to in the treatment of his or her favored Pre-Socratic.<br /><br />Since the book was largely aimed at people finding their way through the literature, Freeman thoughtfully provided a table to find fifth-edition Diels texts as numbered in the fourth edition, which was cited in much of the older secondary literature in English.<br /><br />Naturally, the sixth (by some complex reckonings, also reprinted as the tenth) edition of Diels, as revised by W. Kranz (hence DK), appeared shortly thereafter, in 1952. Scholarship since has relied on this version, known as Diels-Kranz, citing texts by their 1952 DK numbers. Unhappily, neither Harvard University Press nor, apparently, the British publisher, Blackwell, saw fit to issue a new edition of the &#34;Ancilla,&#34; reflecting any changes, or even adding a note making clear whether, and where, the standard numbering had changed in the Diels / DK transition, let alone any differences in the German translation.<br /><br />In fact, it was not until 1983 that the &#34;Ancilla&#34; even appeared in paperback (from Harvard); in the meantime, competing volumes, such as Philip Wheelwright's &#34;The Presocratics&#34; (1966; still in print) had become available, with fewer fragments, but many &#34;Testimonies,&#34; and some sort of running commentary.<br /><br />This delay is somewhat puzzling. The post-war years saw a considerable increase in publications concerning the Pre-Socratics, and a less expensive version would presumably have been a textbook of choice in a variety of courses, not just Greek philosophy. Most notably, the German philosophers Heidegger and Jaspers freely interpreted them, if rarely to the satisfaction of a classicist. (More recently, David L. Hall and Roger T. Ames made considerable use of the Pre-Socratics in a trilogy of studies comparing ancient Chinese and early western thought, &#34;Thinking Through Confucius,&#34; &#34;Anticipating China,&#34; and &#34;Thinking From the Han.&#34; I have found these comparisons illuminating.)<br /><br />But at least it is available. And the &#34;Ancilla&#34; still has considerable value, besides its still nearly-complete coverage. Since it had no burden of citations of secondary literature, and no explicit interpretation, there was little to become hopelessly out of date as the pace of publication picked up, and continued to accelerate. In 2002, Gregory Hays cited it, in a new translation of Marcus Aurelius [Modern Library], as &#34;a good starting point&#34; for &#34;Heraclitus and other early philosophers who appear in the *Meditations*.&#34;<br /><br />So the &#34;Ancilla&#34; remains a fine piece of work, endlessly useful to the student. It is just the book to have at hand while reading someone's Greek-laden exposition of, say, Parmenides or Empedocles, or to check a translation that seems too good, or too convenient for an argument, to be taken at face value.<br /><br />In any other situation, however, it is also likely to be endlessly frustrating. Not so much because it doesn't answer questions, but because it gives no guidance in finding answers (you just have to look elsewhere), and doesn't even suggest what questions would be appropriate.<br /><br />Fortunately, when you reach this stage, there are some excellent, and very recent, volumes of translations, currently in print, which cover much of the same ground, but with much more information. Two of them, which should be readily available, also rely mainly on the &#34;B&#34; texts.

One good reason (there are bad ones) is that so many real medieval heresies seem to be mind-numbingly boring to moderns not already committed to a specific religious view -- noticed any big fights between secularists over receiving Communion from unworthy priests lately? And that is an issue moderns can grasp, without understanding the theological implications. Other heretical positions and movements are just plain weird and unattractive to most of us. The Catholic Church wanted celibate clergy, and regular fasting for lay people; the often-romanticized Cathars disapproved of food, sex, and just about everything else, for everyone, at any time (to over-simplify a bit).    And some still well-known and sensational \\"heresies\\" seem to have been invented as a convenient, non-refutable, accusation. The \\"blasphemies\\" and \\"crimes\\" of the Templars, despite a stream of lurid accounts and recent \\"discoveries,\\" were made up for political and financial reasons; the King of France owed them a lot of money, and, like Saddam Hussein, figured that eliminating creditors was better than paying up, and a good way to acquire their wealth. Philip IV was furious to find their treasuries empty; perpetually short of cash, like most medieval monarchs, he had failed to grasp that the one-time military order of monks had been lending him, and others, a lot more than their spare change. So much for coded messages and maps to their secret vaults. Nothing to do,really, with demon-worship, or (as more recently alleged) possession of the Holy Grail (!), but a good example of what can be done with torture and propaganda. The Templars don't make an appearance in the index of this book, for good reason.    Another reason for relative obscurity: this is a massive anthology -- seventy-some pages of general historical introduction are followed by 560 of translations of medieval texts, with short introductions in smaller print, with over 200 pages of notes and bibliography, and a final nineteen pages of index. It was originally intended (by Austin P. Evans) as part of a larger project, setting religious dissension in the Middle Ages, and the operations of the Inquisition, in their social and political settings. The actual book (as completed by Wakefield after Evans' death) is instead a well-organized mine of material on beliefs, reactions, and personalities, with no real parallel in English on anything like the same scale. (Edward Peter's 1980 \\"Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe: Documents in Translation\\" is less than half the length, and has a different focus.)     Broken up into sixty main readings, many with sub-sections, \\"Heresies of the High Middle Ages\\" is a solid, responsible, unsensationalized, source-book, and not something to take to the beach (unless you are trying to keep up with course work).    It is, at a minimum, an invaluable companion to such long-standard books as Runciman's \\"The Medieval Manichee: A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy\\" (1955) and Norman Cohn's \\"The Pursuit of the Millenium: Revolutionary Millenarians and Mystical Anarchists of the Middle Ages\\" (1960; several revised editions), and more recent studies, such as Cohn's \\"Europe's Inner Demons\\" (1975, revised 1993; on the conceptual overlapping of heresy and sorcery). It can, of course, stand by itself.    Certain chronological and theological aspects can be supplemented, on the generally (more) orthodox side, by Bernard McGinn's short anthology of \\"Apocalyptic Spirituality\\" in the \\"Classics of Western Spirituality\\" series (1979), which runs from the Church Fathers in the third century to Savonarola in the late fifteenth, instead of being limited to the \\"High Middle Ages.\\"    The range of the term \\"High Middle Ages\\" varies from historian to historian. In this case, it includes Western Europe in the late tenth and eleventh centuries, with slender documentation for heretical movements; the slightly more detailed sources for the twelfth century; and the turbulent, and well-documented, thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, which are covered in considerable detail. Anyone not familiar with the Church History and dogma, and the main political events, of this period, should probably find and read a good standard textbook or two before plunging in. The editors did a good job, but they had to assume some prior knowledge.    Whenever possible, the quite varied unorthodox movements are allowed to speak for themselves. They range from merely dissenting from the practices of the hierarchy of the Church, to frankly anti-Church, to committed holders of actual theological differences, both obvious and (to modern ideas) amazingly esoteric. The historically prominent Cathars, or Albigensians, are well-represented (with a complete section, #56-60, pages 447-630; and frequent mentions in earlier portions), as are the Waldensians, with whom they are often grouped (see especially #30-38). (The Cathars were out-and-dualists in the Gnostic tradition, and took their alternate name from their one-time domination of the Albi region of southern France; they are historically connected to the Bogomil dualists of the Balkans in the earlier Middle Ages, and, just conceivably, to the actual Manicheans of St. Augustine's time. The Waldensians, when slander, rumor, and later Protestant approval are discounted, seem to have been more conventional critics of the wealth of the Church and its hierarchy.) But so are more obscure groups and individuals, such as the Amalricians (#44A & B), as surviving documentation allows.    Where their own documents are lacking, care is given to include the most responsible hostile reports (such as James Capeli, #49), as well as the more sensational accusations of ill-informed or simply malicious heresy-hunters, such as Guibert of Nogent (#9). The quality of these sources vary, since some writers drew on both their own experience and on rumors and earlier accounts, a clear example being Bernard Gui, an important inquisitor in the first three decades of the fourteenth century (#55, pages 373-445).    An invaluable book for the serious inquirer.	2004-08-22

If you happen to order a used copy, you may get something a lot less attractive than you expected, but the contents are identical.    And the contents are worth having, if you are interested in the problems of early Greek thought about human personality, consciousness, and survival after death. Since later developments of these are still influential in Western Civilization (Jewish as well as Christian) -- and help distinguish it, and its Islamic cousin, from say, Taoism, Hinduism, or Buddhism -- this is not exactly a trivial topic, of interest only to academics who love to quarrel over texts in dead languages.    Bremmer's short book picks up a long-running argument -- apparently going back before Plato -- about just what Homer was talking about when he describes the thoughts, emotions, vital organs, and deaths of his characters, and how the poetic vocabulary of the epics influenced -- or didn't influence -- Greek popular and elite thought through the classical period. (If \\"breath\\" and \\"spirit\\" are the same word, are lungs \\"spiritual\\" organs? What about the heart, which Odysseus admonishes for its unruly emotions? Is losing consciousness a form of death?) Plato raises objections to Homer, and Aristotle splits up Homeric ideas between his treatises on animals, on physiological issues, and on \\"The Soul,\\" but the philosophers still wind up quoting the same familiar lines.    There have been a number of late-nineteenth and twentieth century landmark studies -- those familiar with this field of classical studies will think at once of, among others, Erwin Rohde's \\"Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immorality Among the Greeks,\\" Bruno Snell's \\"Discovery of the Mind,\\" and Richard Onians' \\"Origins of European Thoughtabout the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time, and Fate\\" to mention two prominent German scholars and one English. Rohde and Onians in particular produced encyclopedic surveys; the latter also covering non-Classical cultures (as well as a wider range of subjects).    Bremmer masterfully condenses a lot of complicated evidence and its interpretations, and advances several new arguments, which I found plausible and intriguing, if not always absolutely convincing. Since his book is short (mercifully short, some might say), he does not try to evaluate all of his predecessors, or refute every argument. This makes his writing a lot easier to follow than it might otherwise be; it also has the potential to mislead the novice reader who fails to follow up on Bremmer's short, but well-chosen, Selected Bibliography, or ignores the footnotes citing the major literature of the preceding century (or so).    Since I came to Bremmer *after* reading the above-mentioned books, and several others, I can only suspect that \\"The Early Greek Concept of the Soul\\" would serve as a good introduction to this complex, and still controversial, subject, but it is a very strong suspicion.    The author has since returned to the subject, covering later developments in another brief work, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Afterlife: The 1995 Read-Tuckwell Lectures\\" (2001).	2004-08-20
US	30081986	R3V2YQET8IJRPX	0520239938	942097686	The Homeric Hymns: A Translation, with Introduction and Notes	Books	5	36	36	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Splendid New Translation	For those unfamiliar with the \\"Homeric Hymns,\\" translated in this case by Diane Rayor: they are a set of thirty-three or thirty-four short and long poems in honor of the major -- and a few minor -- Greek Gods, in the dactylic hexameter used in the \\"Iliad\\" and the \\"Odyssey,\\" and other early Greek poems. They are attributed to Homer in the surviving manuscripts, and some allusions and quotations in classical writing. This is not taken seriously, but provides a label. Some are clearly early, a few are suspected of being Hellenistic, or even post-Christian. The longer hymns combine invocation, praise, and extended narratives; the shorter hymns lack the narrative, and in few cases are little more than invocations. They also vary considerably in the solemnity with which they approach the gods (see the trickster Hermes as a baby in Hymn 4). The two opening hymns survive in one damaged manuscript, so \\"To Dionysos\\" is a set of fragments, and, \\"To Demeter,\\" has several gaps. The third, \\"To Apollo,\\" is suspected of being two separate works linked by an ancient editor. The last piece, \\"To Hosts,\\" is sometimes excluded, as it is a reminder that hospitality is a sacred duty, and not actually a hymn, and is also found in other contexts. All but a few are clearly intended for public performance, either as short introductions (proems), or as major pieces in themselves.<br /><br />As I have commented in reviews of other translations, by Apostolos N. Athanassakis  (Johns Hopkins, 1976), Jules Cashford (Penguin Classics, 2003, with Introduction and Notes by Nicholas Richardson) and Martin L. West (\\"Homeric Hymns, Homeric Apocrypha, Lives of Homer,\\" Loeb Classical Library, 2003, with a newly-edited Greek text), this long-neglected body of texts has received several bursts of attention over the last few decades.<br /><br />After a gap between World War I (Evelyn-West's old Loeb bilingual edition of 1914, last revised 1936; probably still available for awhile) and the 1960s, we now have English renderings by Boer (1970; a second edition [1975?] restored a Hymn to Apollo), Sargent (W.W. Norton, 1973), Athanassakis, Shelmerdine (Focus, 1995), Crudden (Oxford World's Classics, 2002), Cashford, West, and now Diane Rayor (University of California, 2004) -- counting only those currently in print. There are also editions and translations of individual hymns. Although English readers await a modern full critical text edition (the most recent are Italian: West, following the Loeb format, gives only major manuscript variants and those emendations he uses, with minimal, albeit useful, notes), and  a full commentary to replace the venerable Allen, Halliday and Sikes (second edition, 1936), this is still a superabundance. \\"Get just one, or collect the whole set!\\" comes to mind.<br /><br />A recent review by a professional classicist (Stephen Evans, on-line in the \\"Bryn Mawr Classical Review\\" 2004.08.02) points out that the Crudden, Cashford, and Rayor translations all have annotations and / or introductions which survey recent literature on the hymns, but that they tend to favor different approaches, and so display remarkably little overlap in their coverage.<br /><br />Rayor does join Crudden in discussing Near-Eastern parallels to the hymns.  Where Crudden cites comparisons of Hymn 3, the great Hymn (or Hymns) to Apollo, to Babylonian and Assyrian compositions about the exploits of the warrior-god Ninurta, though, Rayor is willing to go back to their Sumerian predecessors for the Hymn to Aphrodite. Unfortunately, I am not convinced that the stripping of the love-goddess Inanna (= Ishtar) of her magic vestments as she passes the gates of the Netherworld has much to do with the undressing of the disguised (as a mortal) Aphrodite by the Trojan prince Anchises in Hymn 5 -- particularly since the living body of Inanna is described throughout in terms of the materials of her own cult statue (something even the smitten Anchises would have noticed). The passage comesfrom \\"The Descent of Inanna,\\" which Rayor calls a hymn, although it is usually classed as a narrative. These are not mutually exclusive, as both Greek and Mesopotamian examples show, but if it *is* a hymn, it is *not* to Inanna, but to her rival, the Queen of the Netherworld: it ends with the invocation \\"Holy Ereshkigal, sweet is your praise!\\" Still, taken as a \\"type-scene,\\" it is an interesting parallel, particularly since the setting of the Hymn to Aphrodite is explicitly *not* Greece, but \\"foreign\\" (Asia Minor); and Greek re-workings even of Greek sources can be rather drastic.<br /><br />Diane Rayor's translations are not only the product of a distinguished classicist; they have been polished over several years of public readings, and with her students, to create a version which actually works in performance -- at least in American English. Most other available translations are worth reading aloud (with perhaps the exception of Boer's visually experimental free verse, and certainly of Evelyn-White's stodgy prose), but Rayor's alone invites it.<br /><br />Here is a sample of three recent versions of The (Delian and Pythian) Hymn(s) to Apollo (Hymn 3), lines 331-339, for comparison. Hera, Queen of the Gods, is furious over the many children fathered on others by her husband Zeus, the successful rebel against their father Kronos and his fellow Titans, and current King of the Gods -- particularly the \\"motherless\\" Athena, who emerged from his head.<br /><br />*Cashford*<br />When she had spoken, she went away from the gods,<br />Her heart very angry. Then immediately<br />She prayed, the lady Hera with her cow-eyes,<br />And she struck the earth<br />With her hand flat against it, saying:<br />`Hear me now, Gaia, and broad Ouranos high above,<br />and you Titan gods who live beneath the earth<br />around great Tartaros from whom men and gods come.<br />Listen to me now, all of you,<br />And give me a child apart from Zeus<br />And one not lesser than him in strength.<br />Rather, may he be as much stronger than Zeus,<br />Who sees all things, as Zeus, for his part,<br />Is stronger than Kronos.'<br /><br />*West*<br />So saying, she went apart from the gods, angry at heart. Then straightway she prayed, did the mild-eyed lady Hera, and struck the earth with the flat of her hand and said, \\"Hear me now, Earth and broad Heaven above, and you Titan gods who dwell below the earth around great Tartarus, and from whom gods and men descend; all of you now in person, hear me and grant me a son without Zeus' help, in no way falling short of him in strength, but as much superior as wide-sounding Zeus is to Kronos.\\"<br /><br />*Rayor*<br />In great fury, she stormed from the gods.<br />Eyes dark and wide as a cow's, Queen Hera prayed<br />And with down-turned palms struck the earth:<br />\\"Now hear me Earth and wide Heaven above,<br />and Titans, gods beneath the earth, dwelling around<br />great Tartaros, from whom men and gods derive:<br />all hear me and grant me a child apart from Zeus,<br />in no way weaker in strength than he, a child greater<br />than Zeus by as much as Zeus is greater than Kronos.\\"	2004-08-13
US	30081986	R27K36MU9SK0ZA	0192812173	35326097	Malory:  Complete Works	Books	5	96	99	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Worthwhile Malorys, Not For All	This is mainly a review of two related editions of the work commonly known as &#34;Le Morte D'Arthur&#34; (Anglo-Norman French for &#34;The Death of [King] Arthur). One is Eugene Vinaver's &#34;Malory: Complete Works,&#34; the title of which will be explained shortly. The other is the Norton Critical Edition, as &#34;Le Morte D'Arthur&#34;  -- an admirable book, but not for all readers; as also explained below, the text has some striking visual differences from the usual modern book, which some may find too difficult. Both are original-spelling editions of the fifteenth-century text, in what can be called either very late Middle English, or very early Modern English; other, easier-to-read, editions will also be mentioned below.  Until a mis-catalogued fifteenth-century manuscript in a safe at Winchester College was finally recognized in 1934 as Sir Thomas Malory's account of King Arthur and his knights, the only authoritative text of this now-famous work was that found in the two surviving copies of William Caxton's 1485 printing. Unhappily, its first and last pages are missing, so Caxton remains the source for those passages. (The standard exact, or &#34;diplomatic,&#34; text of Caxton's Malory was edited by H. Oskar Sommer, 1889-1891. There is a recent critical text, edited by James Spisak, 1983, and a facsimile edition, edited by Paul Needham, 1976.) There are thousands of minor differences, and a few very large ones.  Caxton had divided the text into twenty-one books, with numbered and (usually) titled chapters, and called the whole &#34;Le Morte D'Arthur&#34; -- &#34;Notwithstanding that it treateth of the birth, life, and acts of the said King Arthur, of his noble knights of the Round Table, their marvelous enquests and adventures, the achieving of the Sangrail, and in the end the dolorous death and departing out of this world of them all&#34; (Caxton's Colophon). He had also dramatically abridged one long section (his Book Five), and seems to have made some changes of his own in wording, sometimes softening Malory's aristocratic bluntness. When Eugene Vinaver edited the Winchester Manuscript for the Oxford English Texts series, he gave the three-volume set (with critical notes, glossary, etc.) the title of &#34;The Works of Sir Thomas Malory&#34; (1947; revised edition, 1967; third edition, re-edited by P.J.C. Field, 1990).  In Vinaver's eyes, the manuscript revealed that Malory had produced only a very loosely connected set of narratives, distinct &#34;WORKS&#34; to which he, as editor, gave his own titles (which are now in current use, despite the lack of any other authority for some). The idea of a single, continuous, narrative was, in this view, Caxton's; hence the many inconsistencies, such as dead villains showing up alive and still wicked after a few &#34;books.&#34; This decision has given rise to a long critical controversy; Malory was, in Caxton's term, &#34;reducing&#34; some disparate French texts into English, and may have just missed some discrepancies, as he tried to produce a reasonably unified &#34;whole book&#34;. It has also created a certain amount of bibliographic confusion.  Keith Baines' &#34;Rendition in Modern English&#34; of Vinaver's edition (1962; a rewriting, covering every incident, but mostly sacrificing the language) is carefully called &#34;Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur: King Arthur and the Legends of the Round Table,&#34; as if to emphasize that Caxton's &#34;interference&#34; is being removed, without sacrificing reader recognition (and sales). Vinaver's later Oxford Standard Authors one-volume original-spelling text edition (1971), however, is  &#34;Malory: Complete Works.&#34; Vinaver also edited for Oxford University Press a modernized-spelling &#34;King Arthur and His Knights: Selected Tales by Sir Thomas Malory&#34; (1956, 1968, 1975), which maintained the same premise. John Steinbeck, a great admirer of Malory, was delighted by Vinaver's edition, and referenced the Winchester Manuscript in the subtitle of his unfinished &#34;Acts of King Arthur ...,&#34; avoiding the &#34;Morte&#34; designation. (This is in fact an Arthurian novel by Steinbeck, incorporating chunks of source material, *not* a modernization.) Thus far, there is a certain amount of consistency.  However, a more recent Oxford edition, Helen Cooper's modernized spelling edition of the Winchester text for The Oxford World's Classics (1998; abridged, unfortunately; otherwise excellent), is instead titled &#34;Le Morte D'Arthur.&#34; So, too, is the medievalist R.M. Lumiansky's much more extensively modernized 1982 complete version of the Winchester text. (Almost a translation, and thus an implied commentary on the text; but not to be confused with Lumiansky's projected, and unpublished, critical edition, almost complete at the time of his death in 1987. But is quite impressive, and I can understand anyone who thinks I am too critical of it.) The title of the facsimile edition for the Early English Text Society (N.R. Ker, 1976) &#34;The Winchester Malory,&#34; avoided the issue, but the volume also helped renew the debate over Vinaver's theory by eliminating his editorial hand.  Stephen H. A. Shepherd's Norton Critical Edition is &#34;Le Morte D'Arthur&#34; on the cover, but on the title page has the Caxton-derived subtitle of &#34;The Hoole Book of Kyng Arthur and of His Noble Knyghtes of The Rounde Table.&#34; This title may well go back to Malory, or least to the manuscripts; it would have appeared on the missing final pages. Shepherd, indeed, gives considerably more weight to Caxton's evidence than has been customary. It has become clear, from printer's marks, that the Winchester Manuscript was in fact available to Caxton, and was still on hand when his successor, Wynkyn de Worde, reset the &#34;Morte&#34; in 1498, introducing some of its readings. This suggests that Caxton was comparing at least two manuscripts, and that some of his &#34;innovations&#34; may reflect Malory's intentions as much as any other scribal copy.  The one-volume Oxford  &#34;Malory: Complete Works&#34; is a rather bare-bones edition (especially compared to its three-volume prototype), consisting almost entirely of a very lightly &#34;normalized&#34; text (abbreviations are silently expanded, but variant spellings are usually preserved, etc.), with some good textual notes and a glossary (about a hundred pages of &#34;apparatus&#34;). In the Norton Critical Edition, Shepherd offers the reader an extended Introduction, Chronologies, a text with explanatory footnotes, a large section of &#34;Sources&#34; (earlier and / or alternative versions of Arthurian stories, many translated by Shepherd) and &#34;Backgrounds&#34; (contemporary medieval documents and modern histories illustrating Malory's times) and &#34;Criticism&#34; (essays and book excerpts), followed by a thirty-two-page double-column Glossary, a &#34;Selected Guide to Proper Names,&#34; and a Selected Bibliography. (There is also a website, accessible through W.W. Norton's main page; it lists printing errors, and reports that the corrections of those identified have now been made in a second printing.)  Shepherd's text itself includes more of Caxton's readings, which seem to reflect another manuscript with different errors; and manuscript is the crucial word. Unlike Vinaver, who attempted to reproduce what he regarded as Malory's intended structure (or non-structure), Shepherd aims to create the impression of reading a medieval manuscript, without the most difficult obstacles. Not only are original spellings preserved, he carefully includes marginal notes and other indicators of scribal practices. The two scribes of the Winchester Manuscript carefully (but not completely consistently) wrote names, and some passages, in red ink (&#34;rubrications&#34;). Shepherd does not ask the printer for two colors, but follows the practice of &#34;Scribe A&#34; in using a more ornate script for the rubrics, substituting a black-letter font, so these words stand out; in some cases, following the scribes' use of larger lettering, they are printed in an extra-bold face.  Shepherd has some sensible solutions -- not identical to Vinaver's -- to such problems as character variation ('u' and 'v' and 'i' and 'j' had yet to settle into their modern restrictions, for example), erratic word divisions, and punctuating sentences whose beginning and / or end is not clearly marked. [A recent review by Jim Allan, posted on the &#34;Le Morte Darthur&#34; side, elegantly summarizes Shepherd's approach to these and other problems.]  This does not make for easy reading; it does reproduce, as nearly as possible in a printed book, and with modern typefaces, the experience of reading a medieval book -- which is the point of the exercise. As someone who once pored over the facsimile of the Winchester Manuscript without being able to make out much from the fifteenth-century handwriting, I love it. And it is not Shepherd's eccentric decision. It is part of a renewed appreciation for the medieval book as a physical artifact, not a sort of nuisance to be made transparent by modern typography.  However, with their 'olde spellynges' and other peculiarities, neither the Oxford Standard Authors version nor the Norton Critical Edition is suitable for all readers. Although Lumiansky's version comes close, there is still a need for a *complete* &#34;normalized&#34; edition based on the Winchester text, only very lightly modernized as to spelling, and faithfully preserving the original words and sentence structures.  [Note, February 2015: There is a new critical edition of Malory, edited by P.J.C. Field, published in two volumes by D.S. Brewer, as volume 80 in the &#34;Arthurian Studies&#34; series (&#34;Sir Thomas Malory: Le Morte Darthur,&#34; Cambridge, 2013). It is based on both the Caxton and Winchester texts, and attempts to arrive at a state of the text closer to Malory's own than either example. This (expensive)edition has been reviewed by Kenneth Hodges for the on-line &#34;The Medieval Review&#34; (The Medieval Review 15.02.03). Addendum, December 2015: In the meantime, Amazon has finally let me post a separate review of the Norton Critical Edition, which is slightly different from the present version.]  [Addendum, December 2015: There is now a dual-text edition of the Caxton and Winchester editions available for Kindle: “Complete Works of Sir Thomas Malory,” from Delphi Classics (Series Five Book 1). I’ve reviewed it: in brief, it consists of Pollard’s 1903 modernized text of the Caxton edition, with his glossary (but not his character index), and, from an unspecified source, an old-spelling edition of the Winchester Manuscript. I have noticed that the latter has errors on the order of “Qur” for “our,” but does’t seem, on first inspection, to be *too* badly corrupted. (I may be wrong about this….)  [The Delphi edition is an inexpensive way for anyone interested in the “Morte D’Arthur” to get a good look at both versions. Unfortunately, while the Pollard text has hyperlinks to Caxton’s book and chapter divisions, there is no equivalent for the longer Winchester Manuscript, nor is there any cross-referencing between matching passages. For the Winchester text, at least, the intrigued reader may well then decide to try the Norton Critical Edition, Vinaver’s “Malory: Complete Works,” or the solid, but abridged, version edited by Helen Cooper for the Oxford World’s Classics series, as “Le Morte Darthur: The Winchester Manuscript.”]  [Addendum, December 9, 2015: Vinaver’s approach to the unity of the &#34;Morte&#34; is now taken for granted by some. On December 7, 2015, BBC Culture, in explaining the basis of a list of “the 100 greatest British novels,” specifically classed “Morte D’Arthur” as a short story collection. Leaving aside the different question of whether Medieval romances meet one’s definition of “a novel,”many of the eight “Tales” into which Vinaver divided the text are more like short — or longer — novels than they are like short stories. In the Norton Critical Edition, “The Tale of Sir Tristams de Lyones” runs to over 250 pages — and does not contain the full story, at that. (Of course, it too can be broken down into shorter &#34;tales&#34; as the focus of the narrative shifts.)]	2004-08-08
US	30081986	RMS94ZFA2B6U7	014043044X	782642917	002: Le Morte d'Arthur: Volume 2 (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	169	181	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Caxton's Malory, Penguin and Others	Since reviews of entirely different editions seem doomed to appear together: This is a review of the two-volume edition of Sir Thomas Malory's &#34;Le Morte D'Arthur&#34; published by Penguin Books, edited by Janet Cowan, with an Introduction by John Lawlor. Originally part of the Penguin English Library (1969), it was later (1986) included in the Penguin Classics, in both the older, smaller (mass-market) Penguin format and the current, somewhat larger format; they all appear to be identical in contents. However, I will discuss other versions, notably the Modern Library, the Wordsworth Classics, and the old Everyman's Library editions.<br /><br /> The Penguin edition is based primarily on the 1485 text printed by William Caxton. It is modernized in spelling, but not in grammar. Each volume has a glossary of proper names, and another of archaic words; the most difficult words are generally noted and translated at the foot of the page on which they appear. A small section of notes in each volume deal with some confusing passages, and identify places where Caxton's text has been emended -- usually from the &#34;Winchester Manuscript,&#34; now in the British Library, discovered in a safe at Winchester College in 1934, after being mistakenly catalogued under the title of a 1634 printed edition. The manuscript differs from Caxton's text in thousands of places, mostly minor, but some very important.<br /><br /> (There is now another set of editions, based primarily on the longer Winchester text; unfortunately, modernizations of that version are either abridged, or, in my opinion, more or less open rewritings, or both, like Keith Baines' &#34;rendition&#34; -- not to mention John Steinbeck's unfinished &#34;Acts of King Arthur ...,&#34; which is a retelling as a modern novel. Two complete old-spelling editions of this second, longer, version, are in paperback, the Oxford Standard Authors original-spelling edition, as &#34;Malory: Complete Works,&#34; followed by a recent Norton Critical Edition, as &#34;Le Morte D'Arthur,&#34; on somewhat different lines. I have reviewed them together, under the &#34;Complete Works&#34; title; both are worthwhile, for readers willing and able to deal with them.)<br /><br /> Among the readily available editions of the Caxton &#34;Morte,&#34; the Penguin edition is my favorite; a judicious balance of modern, or regularized, spellings, clarifying punctuation, and short explanations, without distortion of the not-yet-quite-Modern English of the sentences. Although Lawlor's introduction is beginning to show its age (Malory's French and English sources are treated as evidence in a then-current critical debate), Janet Cowan's text remains exceptionally attractive. The two-volume format is easy to handle, but can be a bit of a nuisance; if you want the whole story, be sure to order both!<br /><br /> It was Caxton, the pioneer of English printing, who assigned the title &#34;The Death of Arthur&#34; to a work which begins with Arthur's conception and birth, for reasons which he rather laboriously explained in a final colophon. (For those of you who know enough French to see that the title should begin &#34;La Mort&#34; -- the spelling is, as elsewhere in the text, based on medieval *Norman* standards, and the Parisian certainty of Death's feminine gender did not dictate English scribal -- or printing-house -- practices in the fifteenth century.) Until the publication of the Winchester text in 1947, all editions of this famous late Middle English compilation of stories of King Arthur and his Knights had to be based, more or less (and often less) directly, on the 1485 printing by William Caxton, of which two copies have survived, one missing fifteen leaves.<br /><br /> Unhappily, most nineteenth-century printings (the first two both in 1816) were based on the very corrupt (&#34;improved&#34;) 1634 Stansby printing, sometimes sporadically compared to the Caxton text, or were in some other way &#34;corrected&#34;for (mainly) Victorian readers. In 1817, the poet Robert Southey tried to rely on Caxton, but had to replace the missing pages in the copy he was using with those in one of the reprintings, in 1498 and 1528, by Caxton's apprentice and successor, the self-named Wynkyn &#34;de Worde.&#34; (The first is the original &#34;illustrated Malory,&#34; the second is the first intentionally &#34;modernized&#34; Malory, customers having apparently complained that a book written in the 1460s was sounding a bit old-fashioned.) In addition, Southey's publisher seems to have used Stansby as a printing-house copy, directly or through the competing reprintings of 1816. Uncertainty as to proper editorial principles, reflecting uncertainty as to Malory's literary worth, and concern over the &#34;immoral&#34; contents of a book thought likely to appeal to boys, continued through the nineteenth century. (And into our time, as well.)<br /><br /> The three-volume edition (with extensive apparatus) by H. Oskar Sommer of 1889-1891 finally used the surviving copies of the 1485 edition as the sole authority. (I have not seen a reported reprinting of the full version, but Sommer's &#34;Morte&#34; text, without the introduction, notes, glossary, etc., is available in a hypertext format). It was presumably used by F.J. Simmons, who edited the ornate J.M. Dent edition of 1893-1894, illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley (reprinted a few years ago by Crown; Dover has issued an illustrations-only volume as well). Sommer's text was certainly used by Israel Gollancz for another Dent edition, the modernized four-volume Temple Classics version of 1897. This text appears to have been reset for a two-volume edition in 1906, in Dent's Everyman's Library series, with normalized (modern) spellings. There are some peculiarities in this version; for example, the spelling of names often changes between volumes one and two. For most purposes it was reliable enough, and was widely read during much of the twentieth century, appearing in the US in hardcover in Dutton reprints of the Everyman's Library, with a paperback edition in the 1970s. It seems to be out of print, but used copies show up regularly.<br /><br /> The Dent editions of the &#34;Morte&#34; had competition from other modernized texts, based on the Sommer edition, which included a revision by Sir Edward Strachey of his somewhat expurgated (&#34;for boys&#34;) 1868 Globe edition for Macmillan. This version was replaced by a new Macmillan edition in 1903, edited by the distinguished bibliographer, and able editor of popular editions, A.W. Pollard. Pollard's text has been reprinted by a number of American publishers, and was at one time a Book Club offering, advertised as &#34;unexpurgated&#34; -- which it was, compared to some Victorian editions, and most especially to Sidney Lanier's &#34;The Boy's King Arthur.&#34; The Pollard text is available on-line. It has been reprinted yet again, in the current Modern Library hardcover and paperback editions, with a fine new introduction, by Elizabeth J. Bryan, describing briefly the Arthurian Legend, and the problem of the two texts of the &#34;Morte.&#34; The Pollard text also appears to underlie the Wordsworth Classics paperback, which has a helpful new Introduction, by Helen Cooper, and includes an index of characters (by Book and Chapter, not page number), but lacks notes. It is a relatively inexpensive, if not overwhelmingly attractive, alternative to the other editions.<br /><br />Since the appearance of the Penguin &#34;Morte,&#34; there have been two major technical publications of the Caxton text: a facsimile, edited by Paul Needham (1976), and a critical edition, edited by James Spisak (1983). I am not aware of a popular edition which has taken advantage of these resources.<br /><br />[Note, February 2015: There is a new critical edition of Malory, edited by P.J.C. Field, published in two volumes by D.S. Brewer, as volume 80 in the &#34;Arthurian Studies&#34; series (&#34;Sir Thomas Malory: Le Morte Darthur,&#34; Cambridge, 2013). It is based on both the Caxton and Winchester texts, and attempts to arrive at a state of the text closer to Malory's own than either example. This (expensive) edition has been reviewed by Kenneth Hodges for the on-line &#34;The Medieval Review&#34; (The Medieval Review 15.02.03)]<br /><br />[Addendum, December 2015: There is now a dual-text edition of the Caxton and Winchester editions available for Kindle: “Complete Works of Sir Thomas Malory,” from Delphi Classics (Series Five Book 1). I’ve reviewed it: in brief, it consists of Pollard’s modernized text of the Caxton edition, with his glossary (but not his character index), and, from an unspecified source, an old-spelling edition of the Winchester Manuscript. I have noticed that the latter has errors on the order of “Qur” for “our,” but does’t seem, on first inspection, to be *too* badly corrupted. (I may be wrong about this….)<br /><br />[The Delphi edition is an inexpensive way for anyone interested in the “Morte D’Arthur” to get a good look at both versions. Unfortunately, while the Pollard text has hyperlinks to Caxton’s book and chapter divisions, there is no equivalent for the longer Winchester Manuscript, nor is there any cross-referencing between matching passages. For the Winchester text, at least, the intrigued reader may well then decide to try the Norton Critical Edition, Vinaver’s “Malory: Complete Works,” or the solid, but abridged, version edited by Helen Cooper for the Oxford World’s Classics series, as “Le Morte Darthur: The Winchester Manuscript.”]<br /><br />[Addendum, December 9, 2015: Vinaver’s approach to the unity of the &#34;Morte&#34; is now taken for granted by some. On December 7, 2015, BBC Culture, in explaining the basis of a list of “the 100 greatest British novels,” specifically classed “Morte D’Arthur” as a short story collection. Leaving aside the different question of whether Medieval romances meet one’s definition of “a novel,” many of the eight “Tales” into which Vinaver divided the text are more like short — or longer — novels than they are like short stories. In the Norton Critical Edition, “The Tale of Sir Tristams de Lyones” runs to over 250 pages — and does not contain the full story, at that. (Of course, it too can be broken down into shorter &#34;tales&#34; as the focus of the narrative shifts.)]	2004-08-06

For clarity, I am going to offer readers unfamiliar with the work some facts, before briefly describing the excellent Oxford World's Classics version (the sixth in English), translated and annotated by the team of Julia Conaway Bondanella and Peter Bondanella. I hope that this will help others find their way through a confusing bibliography. (Those familiar with Cellini should skip to the end.)<br /><br />Benvenuto Cellini, Florentine goldsmith, sculptor, and enthusiastic self-promoter, can safely be described as a man of the sixteenth century, since he was, conveniently, born, in November 1500, and died in February 1571. Other statements about him, however truthful, often sound like fiction. The autobiography he wrote and (he says mainly) dictated between 1558 and 1566 breaks off in November 1562. It covers several tumultuous decades in later Renaissance and early Counter-Reformation Italy, with excursions into the Swiss Alps and France. Alongside Cellini's frequent descriptions of his own prowess as an artist, a duelist and brawler, and a lover, it is notable for Cellini's almost equally frequent confrontations with celebrated figures; it sometimes seems the most appropriate title would be \\"And Then I *Told-Off* the Pope, the Emperor, the King and Queen, the Duke and Duchess, and the Judge.\\" Amazingly, a lot of it can be confirmed from contemporary documents; Cellini's penchant for getting into trouble, and the fact that he worked in precious metals, both helped leave paper trails.<br /><br />Cellini's treatises on goldsmithing and sculpture were published in his lifetime and include autobiographical passages; his account of his life had a limited circulation in manuscript, including one corrected by his own hand, until it was published, from an inferior copy, in 1728. A series of Italian critical and popular editions have followed, up to the present. He has yet to achieve the status of Michelangelo and Raphael, which he coveted, but he is being read. His great bronze statue of Perseus, the casting of which he told and retold, was recently restored. Unfortunately, this was soon overshadowed by the theft of his last surviving goldwork, the \\"salt-cellar\\" he created for Francis I of France (not the original patron for which it was designed, as usual).<br /><br />[Stolen in 2003, the ten-inch high object was finally recovered in January 2006; at which time its worth was estimated at 60 million dollars. Or -- in the same BBC story -- as either 33.9 or 36 million pounds; I'm sure Cellini would have insisted on the higher figure. He certainly would have been delighted by the constant repetition that it is \\"the Mona Lisa\\" of sculpture,\\" until he decided that the reference should be the other way around.]<br /><br />The first English translation, by Thomas Nugent, appeared in 1771. A German rendering (serialized beginning in 1796, according to the Bondanellas), published in book form in 1798, ensured the work immediate European attention; the translator was Goethe, THE international best-selling celebrity author of the age. A second English version, by Thomas Rosco, appeared in 1822 (\\"Memoirs\\"). By this time a specifically Romantic vision of Cellini was developing, immortalized in Hector Berlioz's splendid opera of 1838, \\"Benvenuto Cellini.\\" (Was Berlioz's own highly entertaining autobiography influenced by Cellini's example? Or Goethe's?)<br /><br />The classic rendering in English, by John Addington Symonds, \\"The Life of Benvenuto Cellini, Written by Himself,\\" was published in 1888. The Bondanellas attribute Cellini's present fame in the English-speaking world to this translation. It has certainly appeared in a variety of forms, including abridgments, and under various titles, and is sometimes listed by editor. It is still in print; there is a Gutenberg e-text available on-line, which is easily searchable, but you need toknow Symonds' renderings of Cellini's sixteenth-century spellings of names. (There was even an edition of the Symonds translation illustrated by -- Salvador Dali!)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the popularity of Symonds' translation overshadowed a richly documented fourth translation, with extensive commentary, by Robert H. Hobart Cust, published in 1910 (as \\"The Life of ... \\"); if I remember correctly, I once consulted its notes in a library reserve copy, but have no impression of its quality as a translation. (I also have no idea why Dover never picked it up for reprinting, when they offered a translation of the Treatises.) According to the Bondanellas, Cust's version is still, for most purposes, *the* scholarly edition, in any language (Italian included), although more often used than cited.<br /><br />Since 1956, editions of Symonds have had to compete with George Bull's translation, for the Penguin Classics, as \\"The Autobiography,\\" which also was the basis of a Folio Society illustrated edition of 1970. Bull's version seems to be regarded as more accurate than Symonds'. Some (myself included) prefer Symonds' prose style; I have adapted much of this review from my notes comparing these two versions. (In revising, I have drawn heavily on the Bondanella's documentation, using their spellings and dates for other translators and editions.) Unhappily, like most Penguin editions of its vintage, it lacked notes or an index; a limited bibliography was supplied in some later printings. It was not until 1999 that the Penguin Classics edition was reissued in a revised version, with extensive notes and a detailed index. There are slight changes in pagination between the two editions of the Penguin translation, but it is my impression that Bull's translation was supplemented, rather than extensively revised. The Penguin edition may or may not be in print as you read this; anyone ordering a used copy should be aware of the difference. (The last page of the original version is 397, of the revised is 496.) For the notes and index, I prefer the 1999 edition to any form of the Symonds translation currently available. And now there is a third choice.<br /><br />The Bondanella translation is based on the latest critical editions of the Italian text, and, quite explicitly, on Cust's documentation and explication. I am delighted with the result. The translation is more to my taste than that of Bull, or even Symonds. The Introduction and Chronology are clear, and the Select Bibliography is an invitation to further reading. The index is extremely useful. The annotations are tightly integrated with the text, and concisely explain allusions, identify people, supply facts, and answer many questions. (There are, inevitably, a very few points I would question: shouldn't the note on \\"unicorn's horn\\" on page 408 have mentioned that it may have been a narwhal tusk?)

US	30081986	R3H9UNPM2I8GUN	1590210123	347836567	The Book of Ceremonial Magic	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Standard Old Study, Under Any Title	Arthur Edward Waite (1860-1942) was a professed mystic, an historian of mysticism, alchemy, magic, and secret societies, an industrious translator, and a man unusually willing to turn 180 degrees from a published opinion when faced with new and better evidence. His variously titled \\"Book of Black Magic and of Pacts\\" (first edition, privately printed 1898; public edition, 1911), or \\"Book of Ceremonial Magic\\" (etc.) shows Waite rejecting the misinformation and misrepresentations of his old source and model, \\"Eliphas Levi\\" (real name Alphonse Louis Constant, c.1810-1875) and his sometime-associate in the Order of the Golden Dawn, S.L. MacGregor Mathers (1854-1918), and trying to offer the interested public a responsible survey of the literature of ceremonial magic.<br /><br /> The book in question is frequently reprinted, under a variety of similar titles, although it is now very badly dated; I have reviewed another edition, published as \\"The Book of Black Magic,\\" and repeat my observations here. Under any title, it contains a number of oversights and errors of fact, but it retains considerable value and interest, and is worth reading with care, and *critical* attention. Some titles do raise (various and different sets of) false expectations, however. I have not seen all editions; with the exception of the recent Weiser edition as \\"The Book of Black Magic,\\" which appears to reprint the shorter, and apparently less (or un-) illustrated, 1898 edition, those I have seen seemed to have identical texts (but there may be differences I've missed).<br /><br /> Waite makes interesting points on the presuppositions of the genuinely early grimoires (books of spells and rituals) which he describes and excerpts, and useful comments on the (un)reliability of the then-current translations, many of which have been reprinted in recent years. Anyone attempting to use it as guide to practicing such magic should heed Waite's warning that he has taken care to present an incomplete or corrupt form of any ritual involving harm to animals, rendering the spells, by the magical hypothesis, ineffective; entirely out of concern for the animals, not the would-be-magicians, he explains.<br /><br /> Indeed, Waite has little patience with the operative magician in general, and with those who supply the demand for spellbooks in particular. He points out that, in terms of procedures and intentions, the magical literature allows no real distinction between \\"white\\" and \\"black\\" magic; indeed, what is presented as \\"white\\" magic, is, by making direct use of religious rites and objects, sometimes the more objectionable. He also points out that the medieval and early modern magicians generally seemed unaware that what they were doing could be considered blasphemous.<br /><br /> Among its other merits, Waite's book provides extended excerpts and illustrations from the leading pseudo-grimoires published in cheap editions in (mainly) France in the nineteenth century. He points out the origins of some of these tracts in more respectable \\"occult\\" writings of the eighteenth century. (A rather wavering line probably could now be drawn back all the way to the Hermetic enthusiasts of the Renaissance, and ultimately to Hellenistic Egypt, but all genuine Egyptian content, except mention of the Pyramids and Pharaohs, had vanished along the way.)<br /><br /> Waite attempts, albeit with inadequate data, to establish the medieval date and Christian origins of the various \\"Books\\" and \\"Keys\\" of Solomon, a task still not complete in detail, and compares these texts to explicitly Christian works, some masquerading as highly effective devotions. The book is concerned with the relatively elite practice of ritual magic, including its many vulgarizations, and not with European witchcraft, nor with Satanism as such.<br /><br /> As Waite points out, the grimoires promise to teach how to compel, bribe, and trick devils, not worship them (although from a theological point of view, as he makes equally clear, the distinction is meaningless). Pacts are attempts to force supernatural beings to serve humans, not promises of one's own soul -- except where the intention is to break the pact.<br /><br /> The nearest successor to Waite's book to appear in English was Elizabeth M. Butler's \\"Ritual Magic,\\" first published by Cambridge University Press in 1949, and recently reprinted. It shows a dependence on Waite for materials unavailable to its author in wartime and post-war Britain, but has considerable additional material on actual and supposed magicians (including Gilles de Rais), and on nineteenth century magicians, pseudo-magicians, Satanists, pseudo-Satanists, and hoaxes, and provides an invaluable context for understanding Waite's writings, not just this book. Her book can be read as a follow-up, but also as an introduction.<br /><br /> Butler, more importantly, fills a gap in Waite's coverage. \\"Ritual Magic\\" offers a good discussion of the various German (and generally Central European) books purporting to contain the magic of Faust; these are generally duller than the French pamphlets described by Waite, but seem to be rather more likely to reflect real attempts to practice the \\"black arts,\\" and represent a different geographic area. \\"Ritual Magic\\" was, in fact, the middle volume of a trilogy on the Faust tradition (including \\"The Myth of the Magus\\" and \\"The Fortunes of Faust'), and Butler's literary interests are clear throughout.<br /><br /> Those with a genuine interest in current research on the history of European traditions of magic will probably want to turn to the essays in \\"Conjuring Spirits: Texts and Traditions of Medieval Ritual Magic,\\" edited by Claire Fanger (1998), and Richard Kieckhefer's \\"Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century\\" (1997). These all, especially the latter, contain excerpts of texts to compare to those offered by Waite. (Kieckhefer gives a long Latin text as well.) A shorter survey, covering a number ofother topics, and with briefer quotations, is Kieckhefer's \\"Magic in the Middle Ages\\" (Cambridge University Press, 1989; the Canto paperback of 2000 has a useful new Preface with updated bibliography). Kieckhefer also provides a good introduction to the historical literature on witch beliefs and persecutions, and how these relate to elite magic; a subject on which the second edition of Norman Cohn's \\"Europe's Inner Demons\\" is also enlightening.	2004-07-29
US	30081986	R2DVXUU1TJWJ37	1589830229	349817283	Holy Lives, Holy Deaths: A Close Hearing of Early Jewish Storytellers (Studies in Biblical Literature)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A New Approach	I found \\"Holy Lives, Holy Deaths\\" to be an enormously satisfying book, which I would gladly recommend to others to buy -- except for the price. Like other Society of Biblical Literature volumes, it seems to be aimed at professional scholars and libraries, not students and general readers. (Has anyone done a study of the SBL's publishing practices, and whether lower prices, and larger printings or frequent reprintings, would be justified by increased sales?)      I would instead advise trying to find a library copy before ordering it, as I am certain that some readers will find it objectionable on religious grounds (an unfortunate but inevitable fact), or discover that the material is just too unfamiliar, and the approach too difficult, for them to get enough out of it. If you like the book, you will probably want a copy available for further reference; it is packed with interesting details and bibliographic information.      As for the book itself, \\"Holy Lives, Holy Deaths\\" is an impressive attempt to apply tools developed in other fields, notably by New Testament scholars attempting to uncover the oral traditions behind the Gospels, Acts, and the Apostolic Fathers and early Christian apocrypha, to Jewish documents reflecting the same period. This has been done in an unsystematic way by others, but Wire's methodological sophistication and range of materials sheds new light on seemingly familiar territory.      Short narrative passages from Rabbinic literature are arrayed and analyzed alongside comparable narratives from Hellenistic Jewish writings, the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, the Dead Sea Texts, and, perhaps more controversially, the New Testament. The working assumption is that at least some of these stories circulated independently of their present contexts, and that a careful reading reveals how storytellers worked, and the social functions the stories were intended to serve.      Wire covers retellings of Biblical material, stories about Biblical figures,and stories about contemporary (or then recent) events and people, looking for patterns, techniques, and implied occasions. Teaching episodes, miracles, and martyrdoms all find a place, with other subjects, topically arranged for easy comparison of like with like. Among Wire's more interesting contributions is the suggestion (which I think she demonstrates effectively) that many early stories about Jesus fit most naturally in a Jewish setting into the mold of Martyred Prophet / Teacher, NOT that of Failed Messiah.      Readers unacquainted with the Jewish story-telling traditions investigated by Wire may want to compare some equally (or more) wide-ranging collections, without her analytic interventions in the presentation. Unfortunately, most such anthologies are excessively popularized to be of much use for scholarly purposes, or are very scholarly, and assume a great deal of background on the reader's part.      A good approximation of an introductory collection would be the late Raphael Patai's massive \\"Gates to the Old City: A Book of Jewish Legends,\\" which is unfortunately out of print (again). It is usually available used (note that, in my experience, the original Avon paperback edition was so overstuffed that it tended to fall apart on purchase). Unhappily, as the editor-translator, Patai decided to leave out most of the Biblical \\"proof-texts\\" offered in the originals, and so tends to avoid those stories which depend on Hebrew word-play. Patai's companion volume, \\"The Messiah Texts\\" is probably available (if you are willing to wait), and would also be worth consulting. Howard Schwartz is best known for retellings, but his \\"Reimagining the Bible: The Storytelling of the Rabbis\\" is a first-rate collection of essays, with useful bibliographic notes, and much of it is accessible to a beginner, unlike Michael Fishbane's several admirable volumes on Rabbinic readings of the Bible. Among more narrow collections, Reuven Hammer's \\"The Classic Midrash: Tannaitic Commentaries on the Bible,\\" in the Paulist Press's Classics of Western Spirituality series, is an invaluable introduction, with extended sections allowing the reader to see how passages fit into their extant literary context -- the one area where Wire leaves readers to fend for themselves.	2004-07-27

(I would like to be clearer, but it's been several years since I actually handled it, and, to judge from information on Amazon, some of my recollections of it seem to have been wrong.)

(A rather wavering line probably could now be drawn back all the way to the Hermetic enthusiasts of the Renaissance, and ultimately to Hellenistic Egypt, but all genuine Egyptian content, except mention of the Pyramids and Pharaohs, had vanished along the way.)      Waite attempts, albeit with inadequate data, to establish the medieval date and Christian origins of the various \\"Books\\" and \\"Keys\\" of Solomon, a task still not complete in detail, and compares these texts to explicitly Christian works, some masquerading as highly effective devotions. The book is concerned with the relatively elite practice of ritual magic, including its many vulgarizations, and not with European witchcraft, nor with Satanism as such. As Waite points out, the grimoires promise to teach how to compel, bribe, and trick devils, not worship them (although from a theological point of view, as he makes equally clear, the distinction is meaningless). Pacts are attempts to force supernatural beings to serve humans, not promises of one's own soul -- except where the intention is to break the pact.      The nearest successor to Waite's book to appear in English was Elizabeth M. Butler's \\"Ritual Magic,\\" first published by Cambridge University Press in 1949, and recently reprinted. It shows a dependence on Waite (in the 1898 edition, with the original page numbering) for materials unavailable to its author in wartime and post-war Britain, but has considerable additional material on actual and supposed magicians (including Gilles de Rais), and on nineteenth century magicians, pseudo-magicians, Satanists, pseudo-Satanists, and hoaxes, and provides an invaluable context for understanding Waite's writings. Her book can be read as a follow-up, if not an introduction.      Butler, more importantly, fills a gap in Waite's coverage. \\"Ritual Magic\\" offers a good discussion of the various German (and generally Central European) books purporting to contain the magic of Faust; these are generally duller than the French pamphlets described by Waite, but seem to be rather more likely to reflect real attempts to practice the \\"black arts,\\" and represent a different geographic area. \\"Ritual Magic\\" was, in fact, the middle volume of a trilogy on the Faust tradition (including \\"The Myth of the Magus\\" and \\"The Fortunes of Faust'), and Butler's literary interests are clear throughout.      Those with a genuine interest in current research on the history of European traditions of magic will probably want to turn to the essays in \\"Conjuring Spirits: Texts and Traditions of Medieval Ritual Magic,\\" edited by Claire Fanger (1998), and Richard Kieckhefer's \\"Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century\\" (1997). These all, especially the latter, contain excerpts of texts to compare to those offered by Waite. (Kieckhefer gives a long Latin text as well.) A shorter survey, covering a number of other topics, and with briefer quotations, isKieckhefer's \\"Magic in the Middle Ages\\" (Cambridge University Press, 1989; the Canto paperback of 2000 has a useful new Preface with updated bibliography). Kieckhefer also provides a good introduction to the historical literature on witch beliefs and persecutions, and how these relate to elite magic; a subject on which the second edition of Norman Cohn's \\"Europe's Inner Demons\\" is also enlightening.	2004-07-27

The \\"Popol Vuh,\\" written in a Mayan language but a European script, is the most substantial surviving account of the Maya view of their own history, including that of their gods and divine ancestors, and has presented a host of problems for translators. The Tedlock translation of 1985 added new information to the work of many distinguished predecessors, and made substantial parts of the narrative clear (or at least much clearer).    The fact that a fairly extensively revised edition of this book was not only possible, but necessary, in 1996, a decade after its first publication, might have discouraged the publisher from continuing to call the new version \\"Definitive\\" on the cover. The title page more precisely calls it a Revised Edition of \\"Popol Vuh: The Mayan Book of the Dawn of Life ... with commentary based on the ancient knowledge of the modern Quiche Maya.\\" However, \\"Definitive\\" seems to be the marketing buzzword. But how would a third edition be described? (Dennis Tedlock has recently -- 2003 -- returned to the writings of the post-Conquest Maya aristocrats who actually produced the existing \\"Popol Vuh,\\" in \\"Rabinal Achi: A Mayan Drama of War and Sacrifice,\\" so it is clear that his work in the area continues.)    In fact, the work of Dennis and Barbara Tedlock with living Quiche Maya ritualists (priests / diviners / shamans), which, in the first edition, added so much to understanding this early post-Conquest text, was part of a larger expansion of Maya studies, including a more complete decipherment of ancient inscriptions, and greatly improved studies of Maya art. It is now possible to recognize events, and even characters, of the \\"Popol Vuh\\" in art centuries older, and their prototypes a millennium earlier. Meso-American cultures have been re-analyzed, and lost details recovered, as part of a major, and very rapid, shift in understanding.    As an example: a large part of the story of \\"Popol Vuh\\" involves games played in ball-courts, in this world and theworld of the dead; a major collection of papers on this theme, in Mayan and other cultures, \\"The Mesoamerican Ballgame,\\" was based on a conference held the same year the first edition of Tedlock's translation appeared (Scarborough and Wilcox, 1991).    Another change was the adoption of a new official system for writing Mayan languages in the Roman alphabet, one devised, for the first time, by native speakers of the various languages. This adds considerably to etymological and grammatical precision, but enormously complicates recognizing words and names in older systems. (Anyone familiar with the juggling of Wade-Giles and Pinyin transliterations of Chinese will be only too familiar with the kind of adjustment process for ordinary readers.)    Tedlock has attempted, with considerable success, to incorporate this new information, and the new transcription system, into the old structure of the book. In the process, besides adding fascinating illustrations and fine-tuning the translation, he has restructured the introduction and notes. Some interesting personal observations are gone, or greatly reduced. References to older literature, often with Tedlock's reconsiderations, have generally been replaced by citations of more recent studies. Once debatable points have been given firm answers, and new questions have been raised. Some material which, at a first glance, I assumed to be missing, turned out, on close examination (with copies of both editions open in front of me, and the help of a lot of post-it flags), to have been broken up or consolidated in different contexts. In a few places, however, the strain shows, as a once-clear line of argument is disrupted. The sheer complication of the material explicated, in which social, cosmic / astronomical, and agricultural references are constantly intertwined, probably made this inevitable.    Archeological and epigraphic material has somewhat eclipsed in prominence the modern Maya contribution to this edition, although forfuller information it was always necessary to turn to Barbara Tedlock's \\"Time and the Highland Maya.\\"    Among more recent publications of considerable value for understanding the mythological and astronomical material, Susan Milbrath's \\"Star Gods of the Maya: Astronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars\\" (1999) is exhausting, but I found it particularly illuminating. A series of books of which the late Linda Schele was co-author or co-editor (The Blood of Kings,\\" 1986; \\"The Forest of Kings,\\" 1990; \\"Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path,\\" 1993; and \\"The Code of Kings,\\" 1999) are more popular in style, and very rewarding; unfortunately, like everything else in Mayan studies, they have dated very quickly, and the reader should always keep the date of publication in mind. Technical studies -- linguistic, epigraphic, archeological, art-historical -- are now abundant, but also harder for me to judge.    [Addendum, June 2014: At about the time I was writing this review in 2004, a two-volume translation-with commentary-and-texts was being published by O Books in the UK and US; Allen J. Christenson's \\"Popol Vuh: The Sacred Book of the Maya\\" (2003), and \\"Popol Vuh: Literal Poetic Version\\" (2004). This treatment was reprinted by the University of Oklahoma Press in 2007-2008, and is still in print. As the reader of these Amazon reviews will notice, some feel called upon to rank the two translations. I don't (although I have reviews of Christenson's two volumes in progress as I add this note).]    [Addendum February 2015: For some reason, in 2014 I left out any mention of the blog \\"Maya Decipherment,\\" which contains fascinating material from the ongoing exploration of Maya (and other Meso-American) civilization; some of it is fairly technical, but not impenetrably so.]	2004-07-13

I will also include where to find information on some of these topics.  &#34;Giordano Bruno and The Hermetic Tradition&#34; is NOT a biography of Bruno (1548-1600), who, according to the common view was burned at the stake for teaching Copernican astronomy (this was one of the charges, but was a side issue). There is a need for a modern biography, but this volume, first published in 1964 -- not, as the listing suggests, 1991 -- was a contribution to understanding Bruno, and not intended as a full account.  (Amazon gives the date of the current University of Chicago trade paperback; there was also a similar Midway Paperback edition in 1979, and a 1968 mass-market paperback edition, as well.)  It is NOT a study of the traditions surrounding Hermes Trismegistus (&#34;thrice-great Hermes&#34;), a Greco-Roman version of the Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek Hermes, among other things, who has had a long history in Western (and Islamic) tradition; it discusses some of them, in the context of Renaissance and Reformation Europe. Collected papers by Antoine Faivre, &#34;The Eternal Hermes: From Greek God to Alchemical Magus,&#34; translated by Joscelyn Godwin, now approximate such a full account (paperback, 1995).  It is also NOT an historical account of the Greek and Latin (and Arabic, and some other) mystical / philosophical, magical, and alchemical texts purporting to be the works of Hermes and his disciples. For that, the historically-minded can turn to Garth Fowden's difficult, but rewarding, &#34;The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind&#34; (1986; with new Preface and corrections, as a MYTHOS paperback, 1993). The curious may also look to David Frankfurter's &#34;Religion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance&#34; (also a MYTHOS paperback, 1998) for a fuller context in popular religion. Those who want to adopt Hermeticism as part of their personal religious experience may need to go elsewhere.  It is NOT a translation of those ancient texts, some of which it summarizes for the reader unfamiliar with this rather obscure literature. For those important in Yates' account, see Brian Copenhaver's &#34;Hermetica: The Greek 'Corpus Hermeticum' and the Latin 'Asclepius' in a new English translation, with notes and introduction&#34; (1992; in paperback since 1995). The testimonies (references in other writers) and fragments (mainly excerpts preserved in a Byzantine anthology) are in the four-volume &#34;Hermetica: The Ancient Greek and Latin Writings ...&#34; (1924), edited and translated by Walter Scott (not the novelist). Yates warns against his high-handed editorial treatment of the main texts, but the testimonies, and most of the fragments, are given in more conservative forms; this too is (or was) available in paperback.  It is NOT an account of the Western Occult tradition in the Renaissance, with or without instructions for the would-be practitioner. For an account of the main texts and issues, the curious can begin with Yates' main authority in this matter, D.P. Walker's &#34;Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Ficino to Campanella&#34; (1958; there is a recent paperback). Walker and others are critically reviewed, with new hypotheses, in Ioan P. Couliano's &#34;Eros and Magic in the Renaissance&#34; (1987); a different perspective, and some important corrections to Couliano's data, are found in Noel P. Brann's &#34;Trithemius and Magical Theology: A Chapter in the Controversy over Occult Studies in Early Modern Europe&#34; (1999; both in paperback).  That being the case, what IS &#34;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition,&#34; and is it worth reading?  Yates claimed that the book began as a translation of Bruno's Italian dialogue, &#34;La Cena de le Ceneri,&#34; set in Elizabethan London, and grew. (The dialogue has since been translated, with useful notes, as &#34;The Ash Wednesday Supper,&#34; by Edward A. Gosselin and Lawrence A. Lerner (1977; a Renaissance Society of America Reprint Texts paperback, 1995).  The book is an attempt to restore a missing, or at least neglected, chapter, in Western intellectual history. The &#34;Hermetic Tradition&#34; in the title is the set of beliefs about the supposed Hermes Trismegistus which Renaissance Europe inherited from the Church Fathers. They variously saw him as an ancient Prophet, and the real source of Plato's philosophy, and perhaps the disciple of Abraham or Moses, maybe even their teacher; or as a wicked tool of Satan. When Greek manuscripts of supposed Hermetic texts became available in Florence, the Medici put a priority on translating them, instead of Plato or Plotinus, and Marsilio Ficino obliged, launching a wave of excitement among some European thinkers.  What these thinkers, including, but not limited to, Bruno, did with, and to, the material they were given is the burden of the book. The enthusiasm eventually went underground, especially as it came to be realized that the wonderful Hermetic texts were not only post-Platonic, but post-Christian. This view took centuries to permeate European thought, however, and true believers in the Hermetic texts are still around. (&#34;The Magic Flute&#34; is just one example of originally Hermetic ideas about Egypt surviving into the Enlightenment.)  Bruno himself knocked about Europe, promoting plans for reconciling Catholics and Protestants, spending time -- not very happily -- in Elizabethan England. The Holy Office of the Inquisition eventually became aware that his plan seemed to involve the restoration of Egyptian Sun-worship -- the True, Original Religion of Mankind, as revealed by the Divine Hermes -- in a Christian cloak. There was also more than a hint of plans to use magic, and astrally empowered images, to achieve this and other goals. The heliocentric theory was for Bruno, it seems, just one more proof of the divine nature of the Sun. One can understand their indignation.  It is this Bruno, the Hermetic, the Magus, and the very amateur scientist, which is Yates' centerpiece. She continues the story with some latter-day Renaissance Hermetics, including Campanella (whose utopian &#34;City of the Sun&#34; seems to have revived, perhaps independently, some of Bruno's pet projects).  As someone who was a college student in the early 1970s, I can recall the impact in several areas of this book (then in its 1968 Vintage Books mass-market paperback), and its 1966 follow-up on another neglected area of European history, &#34;The Art of Memory.&#34; Although in later writings Yates tended to leap from bold insights to unsupported conclusions, these two volumes helped rewrite the way a generation of historians would look at the European past. Some of the volumes I have mentioned would not have appeared, or would have been very different, without Yates' contribution. And yes, although not a complete portrait of either Bruno or Hermeticism, the book is still worth the reader's time and attention.  [Note, August 2005; a complaint by a more recent reviewer sent me back to take a close look at my copy of the 10th printing (1999), which is, as I remembered it, cleanly printed, with the plates as well reproduced as in earlier versions (some were made from not-very-good period originals!). Anything less, especially smudged or bleeding print, missing text, etc., as described, should be treated as a manufacturing defect, and the copy, if purchased new, should be returnable for this reason. (Or so I would think.) The University of Chicago Press certainly can do better, and usually does.]	2004-06-23
US	30081986	R1WI2TF89B2836	0140430040	113799572	The Pilgrim's Progress from This World, To That Which Is toCome (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	13	20	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Trustworthy Text	This is intended as a review of the Penguin Classics edition of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress,\\" edited by Roger Sharrock, which, as of this writing, is still in the Penguin catalogue, and presumably will continue to be available. [July note: Penguin is again listing it as current!] Most of my comments are specific to this edition, and a few other closely related text editions.    [Note, February 2015: Thanks in part to Amazon's lumping together different editions, it slipped my notice for quite some time that Penguin Classics released a new edition of \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" in 2008 (2009). This one was edited by Roger Pooley. I have not seen this current edition, but my general comments on the history of the text should still be valid.]    Back in, I think, the early 1970s, I was taking a course in seventeenth century English literature, and encountered a library copy of Roger Sharrock's 1960 Oxford English Texts edition of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which is to Come,\\" an immensely impressive editorial treatment of the famous allegory of the Christian life, but fairly expensive, and, I think, out of print. (There was a revised printing in 1975; it seems to be out of print for now.) Sharrock's edition was intended as a revision of a 1928 edition by J.B. Wharey, but it broke new ground in Bunyan studies. It returned for its base text for Part One to the first edition of 1678, drawing on the second (also 1678) and third (1679) editions only for Bunyan's additions to the text. (For Part Two, published in 1684, only its first printing has any claim to authority.)    This decision was based on the recognition that printing house practices had rather quickly denatured Bunyan's highly personal, colloquial, and even regional (Bedfordshire) English, turning it into what typesetters thought of as acceptably genteel, beginning as early as the second printing. The progress of textual corruption had continued through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, despite several attempts to provide scholarly editions. Close study of Bunyan's other, rather extensive, and generally less frequently printed, writings, helped to establish a clearer idea of his use of English, as against that of the printers. For the first time in centuries, Bunyan's most famous book was available in (almost) exactly his own words, as nearly as possible as he had set it on paper. Since Bunyan's vocabulary and style of punctuation reflected the speaking voice of an accomplished preacher (the \\"crime\\" for which he was imprisoned for twelve years), this almost amounted to restoring the correct meter to a poem long printed with incorrect versification.    Fortunately, or so it seemed, Roger Sharrock had also edited a very slightly modernized text, without the full critical apparatus and notes, for the Penguin English Library (1965). It was not readily available at the campus bookstore, and the student-oriented stores in the area were already being replaced by chains, but there was a religious --- excuse me, a *Christian* -- bookstore in the neighborhood, which had a good selection, and generally well-informed and helpful clerks. I was bemused to find an unfamiliar member of the staff, who was quite enthusiastic about the King James Bible, in what is in fact Elizabethan English, but dubious about an unmodernized version of \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" The book's language is almost a century closer to us in time, and it claims only to be the work of a \\"Tinker and a Poor Man\\" (as the title of American editions of Christopher Hill's biography reminds us), not divine revelation. Still, she assured me, an original-spelling edition of it would be just \\"too hard to understand.\\" Surely I would be better off with one of the many nice adaptations or retellings? See the children's' section. (I had a sudden image of a special angel assigned to each and every copy of the King James Version, to supply linguistic information to its readers, lest they go astray over the unfamiliar words and grammar, but decided not to confide this to the clerk, who was trying to be helpful.)    In the end, it turned out the Penguin English Library edition was unavailable; I eventually found a used copy, years too late for the course, but worth having. I don't find Bunyan an edifying guide to the religious life (see below), but he is in many ways an appealing human being, and a remarkable writer, the author of the last great medieval allegories in English, which are at the same time among the first modern novels.    In 1986, however, Penguin reissued Sharrock's popular edition in the Penguin Classics series, and even gave it a revised edition in 1987, as well as a splendid new cover (from William Blake's illustration of a scene in the book). In the meantime, the Oxford text as such formed the basis of a World's Classics edition, edited by H.N. Keeble, with a new introduction, helpful notes, and a chronology of Bunyan's life based on the latest research (1984). That edition went through a number of printings, and was reissued in slightly larger format when the World's Classics line was revamped as the Oxford World's Classics. Keeble's edition has just been replaced by a new version by W.R. Owens, likewise following Sharrock's critical edition, but restoring a few more (specified) first edition readings which, in Owens' view, make sense as they stand; I have reviewed this last separately.    It should be made clear that I have written this review as a reader with an interest in seventeenth century English literature and history, and a concern with the combination of realism of style and incident with a narrative of marvels and adventures. As far as what John Bunyan considered most important about his work, I am probably a less than ideal reader. Although coming from a secularized Jewish background instead of an Orthodox one, I tend to agree with David Daiches that the Pilgrim, Christian, seems to spend far too much time worrying \\"What must I do to be saved?\\" in theWorld to Come, and too little asking \\"What ought I to do?\\" in this world. Still, I find Bunyan's sincerity, and willingness to work out the implications of his theology, impressive in their own right.	2004-06-09
US	30081986	R3H761SD4F0LP4	0192803611	181526980	The Pilgrim's Progress (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	5	116	121	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Reliable Edition, Improved	John Bunyan was an astonishing man, a working-class genius who, while producing the last great medieval-style allegories in English, helped invent the English novel, apparently without intending either. The bulk of his writings fell into the obscurity of most seventeenth century theological tractates, but a few have remained current, and \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\" (1678) has been of outstanding importance, for a variety of reasons. It was an immediate popular success, even appearing in French and Dutch editions within a few years, and being reprinted in Puritan Boston, where Bunyan's Baptist teachings would have been unwelcome. The second (1678) and third (1679) printings contained expansions. A fraudulent \\"Second Part\\" helped motivate Bunyan to produce his own sequel (1684), published with the First Part ever since.<br /><br />\\"The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which is to Come\\" is, in fact, one of the most widely read works to come out of the era of the English Civil War, Restoration, and Glorious Revolution (which Bunyan did not live quite long enough to see). The number of actual readers, in English and many other languages, certainly exceeds those of Milton, Hobbes, or Locke, possibly all of them together. It is also one of the most misunderstood. In his own time Bunyan (1628-88) was regarded as a dangerous radical; he wrote the first part of \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" while imprisoned for defying authority by refusing to promise to give up preaching. The issue was as much political and social as religious and ecclesiastical; the post-Restoration gentry could fear, but not accept or forgive, the pretensions of a social inferior. (In the age of panic over the \\"Papist Plot,\\" Bunyan's treatment of the ramshackle \\"Giant Pope\\" as nearly harmless is striking: might it be read as an implied attack on the fear-mongering of the Anglican establishment? Perhaps not.)<br /><br />In the late eighteenth century, William Blake still responded to Bunyan the religious andpolitical Dissenter, and the theologically astute recognized him as expounding a particular doctrine, but distance in time increasingly made him seem not only pious, but even harmless. In the nineteenth century, \\"The Pilgrim's Progress,\\" long seen as suitable reading for children, was available to the working class in cheap editions, with the approval of their \\"betters.\\" It found a receptive readership; but it is now clear that many of those readers recognized, as George Bernard Shaw later said, that the sins and failings Bunyan attacked were mainly those of people with money and power. Or, at least, their allegorical representatives always seem to be, or behave like, landowners, merchants, and magistrates, while their victims are working men and women.<br /><br />Bunyan was indeed mostly concerned with problems of salvation (by faith) and predestination (of which you can never be certain), but the allegorical universe Bunyan presents is solidly grounded in material and social reality. Each soul must seek salvation -- the message of self-help, which the proper Victorians loved. But the little community of believers, the congregation of the true faithful, carried another message for the working class -- Organize!<br /><br />This Bunyan has yet to be fully digested by popular culture. There are still a multitude of complacent editions, variously inexpensive, lavish, abridged, retold, glossed theologically or linguistically, or otherwise brought into line with some perceived need, and marketed for (mainly Protestant) Christians in search of edification. (It has found many Catholic, and apparently, some Muslim readers, as well, which is another story.)<br /><br />Those who need a full critical text of this famous work will consult Roger Sharrock's 1960 edition in the Oxford English Texts series, preferably in its revised printing of 1975, and probably in a library (so far as I can tell it is out of print). It was intended as a revision of a 1928 edition by J.B. Wharey,but it broke new ground in Bunyan studies, by returning to the earliest editions of the two parts whenever possible. This was extremely important in restoring the integrity of the text, for reasons I have described in a separate review of Sharrock's popular edition for the Penguin Classics (originally in the Penguin English Library)<br /><br />Those who want a reliable edition for the serious reader or student, without the full apparatus, however, now have a choice of Sharrock's own very lightly modernized \\"popular version\\" for Penguin Books; N.H. Keeble's adaptation of Sharrock's Oxford text for the World's Classics series (published by Oxford University Press; reissued under the Oxford World's Classics imprint), or the present edition by W.R. Owen, which replaces it in the Oxford World's Classics line, and is likewise based on Sharrock's work.<br /><br />These Oxford popular editions follow Sharrock's critical text, in fact rather more closely than Sharrock's own Penguin edition -- Owens even with some additional reversions to first edition readings, where he finds them comprehensible without emendation. They offer introductions, chronologies, notes, and glossaries directed more to the common reader or student, explaining seventeenth-century history and theology, as well as explicating Bunyan's language. All three were admirable examples of scholarly editions adapted for the ordinary reader, which is helpful, because Sharrock's main edition seems to be out of print.  Keeble's edition may be available for the moment, but Oxford, unlike Penguin, doesn't seem to keep multiple versions of a title in print in its \\"Classics\\" line.<br /><br />Since I have copies of both the Penguin and the old World's Classics editions, I hesitated over acquiring this new version. It offered an expansion of Keeble's chronology and notes, and a new introduction, with a bibliography consisting mainly of recent studies (from 1980 on). Definitely an improvement, although not a blockbuster. The big difference, however, is that Owens provides the only illustrations published with the text in Bunyan's lifetime, and the verse captions he provided to them. This is not only interesting; it provides some explicit statements about the text by the author, not otherwise readily available. The illustrations themselves are not impressive -- hardly in a class with those by Blake and Cruikshank, among many others of varying degrees of skill and insight. But they reflect a real, not imaginary, seventeenth-century environment, and are a worthwhile addition to the available evidence.	2004-06-09

That second version remained in print, with a change of covers (from orange to black, and with different art), for over two decades. Its 352 pages contained contributions by R.O. Faulkner and E.F. Wente, Jr., in addition to those by the editor, William Kelly Simpson. Although less comprehensive than Miriam Lichtheim's three-volume \\"Ancient Egyptian Literature\\" (University of California Press), it included material not found in that collection, and the quality and the reliability of the translations was at least equally notable. The only defect was that additions to the original selections had been shoved in at the back, instead of grouped with similar works, according to the original plan of the volume.<br /><br />There have been several new collections of translations in recent years, notably those by John L. Foster and R.B. Parkinson, and I am inclined to consider this \\"third edition\\" among them. The selection of material has been changed, Faulkner's selections have been dropped, and two new contributors, Robert K. Ritner and Vincent A. Tobin, have been added. The volume now runs over 600 pages, and only a small portion of the difference is due to greatly expanded bibliographies and generous layout.<br /><br />Mainly for the benefit of those who know something about ancient Egypt -- especially those familiar with the older version of the book, or the Lichtheim, Foster, or Parkinson collections --  the contents now include:<br /><br />Narratives and Tales of Middle Egypt (four stories, all familiar, but now based on the latest textual editions); Late Egyptian Stories (nine stories); Instructions, Lamentations, and Dialogues (thirteen texts); \\"From the Religious Literature,\\" (selections from the Pyramid Texts, the Coffin Texts, and the Book of the Dead -- the \\"Negative Confession\\" from Chapter 125 -- and TheHymn to the Aten, Penitential Hymns, and the \\"Book of the Heavenly Cow,\\" which is at once a myth, a spell, and funerary text); Songs and Royal Hymns (a cycle in honor of Senwosret III, and \\"The Love Songs and The Song of the Harper\\"); Royal Stelae (nine texts of widely varying dates); Autobiographies (four texts); Scribal Traditions (\\"The Satire on the Trades\\" and selected school exercises); and, finally, the entirely new section of Demotic Literature, including stories (Setne Khaemuas among them), prophecies, fables, and a late Instruction text ('Onchsheshonqy, including the frame story) (eight items).<br /><br />The useful set of illustrations surviving from the first edition remains unchanged, but has been relocated toward the front of the volume.<br /><br />Anyone with a serious interest in Ancient Egypt will want to have this book available. Beginners may find it all a bit overwhelming at first, but the introductory material and concise annotations should be helpful, and, with a very little effort from the reader, the stories, poems, and proverbs should begin to speak for themselves. It is clearly intended for serious adult readers, but I was in High School when I read the old 1923 Erman translation of \\"The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians,\\" in Blackman's 1927 translation from the German, and this is far easier to digest, as well as a lot more up-to-date.<br /><br />(Come to think of it, Erman/Blackman was probably in the 1966  paperback edition, as \\"The Ancient Egyptians: A Sourcebook,\\" for which Simpson supplied an introduction and bibliographic notes -- I suppose I've been reading his work even longer than I remembered.)<br /><br />The only real complaint I would make is that the cover too closely resembles the later printings of the second edition, which likewise featured a pharaonic bust on a black background; if I hadn't seen the thick spine, I wouldn't have looked at the back, seen \\"Third Edition\\" in somewhat subdued lettering, and taken time to readpart of Simpson's Introduction, which gave me a reason to buy it.	2004-06-03

It is a very old term in Hebrew. In current Jewish usage the word refers mainly to a popular mystically-inspired movement which emerged in Eastern Europe in the eighteenth century, and which persists today, chiefly as communities around charismatic leaders, the heirs, or their appointed successors, of their original founders. (There are other Hasidic movements in Jewish history, the most notable being one in Second Temple times, and another, also with mystical leanings, but elitist, in medieval France, the Rhineland, and the German states.)    The community founded by Nachman (Nahman) of Breslov, however, never recognized a successor to the original Rebbe (Rabbi), and continues to regard the writings and traditions of their founder as their truest guide. This has produced a body of commentary around Nachman's writings, and the recollections of his immediate disciples, and a major effort to translate portions into English. The late Aryeh Kaplan played a major part in this effort, which can be called \\"Pietist\\" in a more general sense of reverent deference to the past.    Aryeh Kaplan's translation of, and commentary on, stories told by the Nachman of Breslov (late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries) is an example of Breslover Hasidic piety in two ways. One, in faithful adherence to the text, as it is understood by the Breslover Hasidim. Second, it is faithful in the pious endeavor to explain the text in an edifying, and doctrinally consistent, way. It includes a set of now-classic major \\"Tales,\\" and some other stories told by Rebbe Nachman. for the thirteen \\"canonical\\" tales it gives full attention, in a line-by-line commentary, to both the Hebrew and Yiddish versions (see below), and offers identifications of allusions to Biblical, Rabbinic, and Kabbalistic texts, not all of them equally plausible or helpful.    Aryeh Kaplan had earlier (1973) translated \\"Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom: Shevachay HaRan [&] Sichos HaRan,\\" two pious memoirs by Rabbi Nathan of Nemirov, Rabbi Nachman's leading disciple, as part of a project of making the Bratislaver literature available in English.    In both senses, this is an improvement on Martin Buber's famous \\"Tales of Rabbi Nachman,\\" which launched the tales into the larger world. These are often thought to be translations (first into German, and for English readers from German to English) of the series of allegorical or symbolic stories which \\"Rebbe Nachman\\" told his closest disciples, who took them down in both Hebrew and Yiddish versions. In fact, Buber retold the frequently enigmatic stories in this series in the interests of psychological insight and  to make clear moral points, which is something the original teller didn't seem to have in mind. Rabbi Nachman's public discourses show that he was both interested in, and capable of, expressing such things, but apparently not in the \\"Tales,\\" despite telling his listeners that the stories were filled with meaning. (Buber's rendering of the town's name as Bratzlav, however is not an error or innovation; Bratzlav, Bratslav, Breslov, Breslau, Breslow, and several other spellings can refer to the same place under different political and linguistic regimes, and competing spelling systems -- just as Wilno is also Vilna and Vilnius.)    On the other hand, the Aryeh Kaplan translation is not always the most charming reading imaginable, although apparently faithful, and the received interpretations may strike the reader as rather forced (a common reaction outside the movement). The stories themselves are splendid fairytales, even if it is not always clear what, if anything, a particular passage was intended to represent -- beyond Rebbe Nachman's impressive storytelling ability when he let himself go.    Jewish Lights Publishing has apparently re-issued this collection in two volumes, as \\"The Lost Princess & Other Kabbalistic Tales of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov\\" (December, 2004) and \\"The Seven Beggars & Other Kabbalistic Tales of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov\\" (April, 2005); I haven't seen either volume, and can't comment on whether any changes were made in the text or presentation. (The publisher lists them as 400 and 192 pages respectively, which suggests a complete reprinting, with some repeated material, rather than an abridged edition.)    For those of a more secular turn of mind, or with less patience with exhaustive explications, \\"Nahman of Bratslav: The Tales,\\" translated with commentaries by Arnold J. Band, is an alternative version, very literate, and both fully informed and very informative, without being smothered in details. It is restricted to the thirteen \\"major\\" tales. Band takes the stories very seriously as literature, and as possible expressions of Rebbe Nachman's personality, and is less impressed by their traditional interpretations, although he does show that recurring themes and images do reflect mystical teachings and concerns. (The book was published by the Paulist Press in the Classics of Western Spirituality series, in 1978, about five years before Kaplan's, and presumably is not well regarded by the Breslovers....)    The \\"Tales\\" are, in any case, superb examples of storytelling, which seem to hint of some profound meaning at almost every turn -- even if that meaning remains elusive. Readers intrigued by either rendering, or that of Buber (which has its good points as literature, if not as a reliable source), might then turn to other publications of the Breslov movement for highly traditional raw materials, and, for modern views, to Arthur Green's biography, \\"Tormented Master: The Life and Spiritual Quest of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav,\\" and Ora Wiskind-Elper's rewarding, but sometimes difficult, \\"Tradition and Fantasy in the Tales of Reb Nahman of Bratslav.\\"	2004-05-18
US	30081986	RDOORAFOWU5MF	014044727X	165490463	The Age of Bede (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	68	68	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: New and Expanded	This Penguin Classics volume has had a somewhat complicated history, and those who are familiar with earlier editions, and wondering whether to bother with the new one, or are not familiar with it at all, and are considering a used copy, should be aware of the differences.    It began as a shorter  (206 page) Penguin Classics volume called (a little grandly) \\"Lives of the Saints,\\" published in 1965. This version, edited and translated by J.F. Webb, contained the *The Voyage of Brendan,* Bede's  *Life of Cuthbert* (from the prose version), and the *Life of Wilfrid,* by Eddius Stephanus. The first is a legendary account of the supposed sea voyages of an actual Irish abbot, and was one of the most popular works of the Middle Ages. The Venerable Bede's account of St. Cuthbert was commissioned by a monastic community devoted to his memory, and is based mainly on an earlier anonymous \\"Life,\\" which Bede himself had earlier adapted in verse, and had drawn on for a much less miraculous account of its hero in his \\"History of the English Church.\\" This complicated redaction history is not unusual, but for once we know that three of the versions came from the same hand. The \\"Life of Wilfrid\\" is a partisan account, by one of his followers, of a Northumbrian bishop who somehow managed to have almost as many disputes with his friends as with his enemies. (Bede also deals with Wilfrid in his \\"History,\\" with considerably less enthusiasm than Eddius shows.)    This version had considerable internal coherence, as it illustrated the variety of literature found under the heading of \\"Lives of the Saints,\\" and various roles as edifying entertainment, institutional piety, and partisan propaganda. The three texts are also roughly contemporary, and, as should be clear, reflect Irish and British traditions of hagiography. It was reprinted through at least the mid-1970s (I have a copy from 1975). The quality of the translations of all three is fairly high, although some readers initially entertained by Brendan's symbol-laden adventures in a visionary North Atlantic were probably let down by the increasingly terrestrial and political tone of the remainder.    \\"The Voyage of St. Brendan\\" (not to be confused with the Latin and Middle Irish \\"Lives\\" of this saint) is connected to a larger body of secular accounts of fantastic sea voyages from medieval Ireland (Maelduin, Bran, and others, some no longer extant). It is not clear which Irish tradition influenced the other, however. Bits and pieces of the Brendan version seem credible, but their connection with him may be as much an invention as the psalm-singing birds and terrestrial paradises he and his monks are said to encounter. Since the other Irish voyage stories (*immrama*) seem to have been unknown elsewhere, and the Latin \\"Voyage\\" was both copied and translated throughout Europe, it should be credited with a major role in making Irish literary motifs a part of the European tradition.    It probably is in the background of William Morris' story of voyages to marvelous islands, \\"The Water of the Wondrous Isles\\" (1895), very likely of the quest in \\"The Glittering Plain\\" (1891) and possibly of the setting of his \\"The Earthly Paradise\\" (1868-70). The \\"Navigatio\\" was certainly known to C.S. Lewis when he wrote \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.\\" Tolkien even wrote (and re-wrote) a poem about Brendan, so it is safe to conclude that the \\"Voyage\\" contributed something to \\"The Silmarillion,\\" if not \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"    (Two versions can be found in the \\"History of Middle-earth\\" Volume IX, \\"Sauron Defeated\\" as  \\"The Death of St. Brendan\\" and \\"Imram\\" -- not included in the paperback, \\"The End of the Third Age\\" -- with a correction on page x of Volume X, \\"Morgoth's Ring.\\" Thanks to Tolkien scholar David Bratman for pointing out that it had indeed been reprinted, and was no longer virtually unobtainable in a 1955 issue of a British magazine.)    In 1983, \\"Lives of the Saints\\" was incorporated in the \\"The Age of Bede,\\" edited, with revisions and new translations, by D.H. Farmer. The new title fairly accurately reflected the time and locale of the texts, and ran to 256 pages, including maps and an index. \\"Brendan\\" was shifted to the end of the volume, and, following, the \\"Life of Wilfrid,\\" Bede's *Lives of the Abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow* was inserted. This last is based on the records and traditions of  the dual monastic foundation of which Bede was a member. This expanded form of the collection displayed Bede as a more sober institutional historian, recording the accomplishments, piety, and good works of the leaders of his own community. \\"Lives\\" lacks the accumulation of miracles which had already become connected with Cuthbert. \\"The Voyage of Brendan\\" seems increasingly atypical in the expanded collection, and I suspect some readers never found their way to it, which would be a pity. This edition was somewhat revised in 1988.    The current version appeared in 1998, and featured the insertion of the *Anonymous History of Abbot Ceolfrith* between \\"\\"Lives of the Abbots\\" and \\"The Voyage of St. Brendan.\\" Ceolfrith was Bede's own abbot, and this biography illustrates the difference between Bede's spare and sober account and what could happen when pious memory and oral tradition took over. This brought the length to 278 pages.    I have acquired over the years copies of all three main versions (the 1975, 1983, and 1998 printings). Obviously, the latest has the widest range of material, and is the most up-to-date. The original \\"Lives of the Saints\\" is fine reading, but probably not a good bargain, but unless you feel need for the \\"Life of Ceolfrith\\" (or need the volume for a class), the earlier versions (1983, 1988) of \\"The Age of Bede\\" may be quite acceptable. If I was starting fresh, however, I'd probably go straight for the current edition, with its revised introduction, updated bibliography (\\"For Further Reading\\"), and, of course, an additional text, not readily available in translation elsewhere.	2004-05-15

West's edition and translation of \\"Homeric Hymns. Homeric Apocrypha. Lives of Homer\\" (Loeb Classical Library No. 496) with a bibliographic note that applies to this volume as well:    Back in 1914, the Loeb Classical Library issued, as volume 57 of the series, \\"Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns and Homerica,\\" edited and translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White. A revised and expanded edition of 1920 included a substantial appendix of newly published fragments from Greek papyri; this appendix received a further supplement in 1936, edited and translated by D.L. Page. The volume was reprinted at intervals thereafter (my copy is from 1967), but without updating.     So much for the repeated information.    As was the case with the volume of \\"Homeric Hymns\\" (etc.), this is a whole new edition of part of the contents of the older, single-volume Loeb edition, along with some additional material. \\"Greek Epic Fragments\\" (LCL No. 497) is made up of the summaries and snippets which are all that survive of a body of narrative poetry outside the familiar \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey,\\" dating, at least in theory, from Archaic and early Classical times. The works represented concern not only the Trojan War, but also the earlier wars of Thebes, the Voyage of the Argo, and the adventures of such heroes as Herakles (Hercules) and Theseus, and some lesser-known material. Some of the stories survive in other forms, including the famous, or relatively well-known, \\"Argonautica\\" of Apollonius, Virgil's \\"Aeneid,\\" Statius' \\"Thebaid,\\" and many of the extant Greek tragedies, and in more obscure works, such as the \\"Posthomerica\\" of Quintus of Smyrna. Ancient scholars sometimes noted borrowings or divergences, information preserved as marginalia (\\"scholia\\"), and embedded in other works.    For the most part, however, we are fortunate when we have spare prose summaries of what was in each of the epics, versions from late antiquity preserved under the name of Proclus. These seem to be based at least in part on the works of Alexandrian scholars, who had access to manuscripts of the works in question. The learned travel writer Pausanias supplies some valuable quotations, with critical comments, and there are a variety of other incidental sources, plus invaluable parallel versions in the \\"Library\\" of mythology attributed to Apollodorus. Among recent studies of the problems this presents, Timothy Gantz's \\"Early Greek Myth: A Guide to the Literary and Artistic Sources\\" is comprehensive and relatively accessible.    The whole harvest, however, even counting some works included by West, although usually considered too late to belong to this group, fits on about a hundred mass-market paperback sized pages of Greek text. (For those not familiar with the Loeb series of small hardcovers, the Greek and/or Latin text is printed on the left-hand page, facing an English translation on the right side.)    Nothing, therefore, is going to make this particular volume thrilling reading. Unlike some of the Loeb editions of the tragedians and lyric poets, it is pretty clearly for the serious student, or the enthusiast (like me), not the ordinary literate reader. West, however, presents it clearly, and the edition marks a much-needed advance on Evelyn-White's venerable, but, in my experience, frustratingly antique, version.    On technical points, I must defer to qualified reviewers in the classical journals (see, conveniently, Michael J. Anderson in the on-line \\"Bryn Mawr Classical Review\\"); the initial response seems favorable, with the usual number of suggested alternative readings of the evidence. West has previously edited and / or translated Hesiod, the \\"Iliad,\\" and a substantial body of lyric verse. I am certainly not about to challenge the distinguished editor's decisions!    Despite some residual grumblings about paying for three new books to replace one volume, I look forward to the forthcoming Loeb \\"Hesiod.\\"	2004-05-10
US	30081986	R2FAZUZ45U285P	0195153820	500658212	Norse Mythology: A Guide to Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs	Books	5	160	162	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Another Fine Reference	John Lindow's  \\"Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs\\" is one of three important reference works on the subject currently or recently available, following Rudolf Simek's heavily linguistic \\"Dictionary of Northern Mythology\\" (German edition 1984, translated by Angela Hall, 1993) and Andy Orchard's \\"Cassell's Dictionary of Norse Myth & Legend\\" (and slightly variant titles, 1997). Each of the three takes a different approach, and I have found them nicely complementary.<br /><br />Lindow's coverage, which is well-described in the subtitle, is not as complete in some areas. He does not try to match Simek on, say, Roman-era inscriptions, or Orchard on individual Icelandic sagas. In what he does cover, he is generally more comprehensive, and sometimes, I think, clearer (as on, say, the limited evidence for Norse religious practices). Lindow's discussions of methodologies and theories are informative, useful, and at times even entertaining. On this basis, it might well be a better book than the other two for beginners, although it should appeal to a more advanced readership as well. There is, of course, a trade-off, and some will prefer Orchard's more extensive coverage. (Where beginners in Norse mythology are concerned, Simek might be left to those approaching from a fairly advanced linguistic-oriented background, anyway.)<br /><br />The black and white illustrations are well-chosen, and most of them are clearly reproduced. Bibliographic notes to the articles are supplemented by a section of bibliographic essays (including Internet resources). Again, he provides less raw information than Simek and Orchard, but his presentation is better, and, once again, probably much more useful to a novice. (Mind you, I've been reading in the field since the middle 1960s, and took several relevant courses at UCLA in the 1970s, so I'm using a little imagination; but he tends to suggest books I then found helpful, and many I have wished had been available whenI needed them.)<br /><br />Those already familiar with some earlier popular works on Norse mythology will probably recognize the cover art (part of a reconstructed medieval tapestry), which, most notably, has long been used on the cover of H.R. Ellis Davidson's \\"Gods and Myths of Northern Europe\\" (Penguin). Ironically, as Lindow informs the reader (see caption, page 251), the consensus that it was intended to portray Odin, Thor, and Frey has been challenged in recent scholarship.	2004-05-07

The Brehaut translation of excerpts is still available as a separately listed Kindle Book. As always, take care to be sure what you are ordering.]<br /><br />Gregory, Bishop of Tours from 573 to 594, was a member of a prominent Gallo-Roman family of aristocrats, and, like some of his relatives, was eventually canonized. His accounts of holy men, martyrs, and miracles are still extant; a work on liturgy is lost. He is best remembered, however, for a long work (which he called just \\"Ten Books of History\\") on how Gaul was conquered by the Franks, and ruled (after a fashion) by their royal dynasty, the Merovingians; with their relationships with neighboring kingdoms. It is commonly known as \\"The History of the Franks,\\" although modern scholars tend to disapprove of the title. Gregory generally tells us about what involved members of the dynasty and their followers, or the Church, not the Franks in general. The various rival \\"Kingdoms of the Franks\\" corresponded very roughly to modern France and western Germany, and Gregory clearly did not have later political units in mind.<br /><br />The Franks were Germanic warriors -- probably from a variety of tribes mentioned by Roman historians -- who entered Roman territory as (at least mainly) pagans. The Burgundians, Ostrogoths and Visigoths, Vandals, and other predecessors, had adopted an archaic form of Christianity much earlier, and had come to be stigmatized as followers of the Arian Heresy when they insisted on following their now-traditional ways. The Franks converted -- at least in name -- directly to Post-Nicene, Trinitarian, Catholic, Orthodoxy. This gave their kings an otherwise inexplicable reputation for piety, if not exactly for virtue. (A Merovingian ruler with only one or two illegitimate children, who refrained from murdering more than a few opponents, and tried to protect his subjects, was widely regarded as a saint.)<br /><br />Gregory, after summarizing the history of the world (Biblical and Christian), focuses on events in the lands of the Franks and their neighbors, eventually reaching his own time, which he reports in considerable, sometimes confusing, and not always reliable, detail. He is a primary source for much of the period. Although sometimes frustrating, he is markedly superior to his immediate (and many not so immediate) successors. As a bishop, he was also an important administrator and judge. He understood practical affairs, and he knew many of the people he describes. A tendency to alleviate the blood-stained darkness with miracle stories is understandable. Given the intellectual assumptions inherited from late antiquity, they do not mark Gregory as particularly gullible or superstitious. One does miss the Venerable Bede's moderation in such matters. (And if you are interested in \\"Dark Age\\" Europe, but have not yet read Bede's \\"Ecclesiastical History of the English,\\" try either the Penguin Classics or Oxford World's Classics translation.)<br /><br />Gregory's world is the reality behind some later medieval literature, He describes the age of Beowulf (literally; King Hygelac's raid on Frankish-allied Frisia is reported in one chapter). With its royal feuds, pursuit of buried treasure, and royalty with names like Sigibert, Sigismundis, and Brunnichildis, it is the background of parts of the \\"Nibelungenlied\\" and \\"Volsunga Saga.\\" For these reasons alone it would be worth attention. It is also interesting on its own. Despite many lapses in narrative logic (from a modern point of view), and uneven command of Latin, Gregory could tell interesting stories reasonably well. (Erich Auerbach's \\"Mimesis\\" has a brilliant discussion of Gregory's failures as a narrator, but fails to mention that the analysis is of a passage -- with inconsequential details of a minor quarrel leading up to a scandalous blood feud -- in which Gregory is reporting testimony given *in his own courtroom*.)<br /><br />The late Lewis Thorpe's translation is the second complete version in English. The first, by O.M. Dalton, appeared in two volumes -- the first being an Introduction -- in 1927, and was reprinted in the early 1970s. It has a reputation for meticulous accuracy, not for enjoyable reading. (I made unsuccessful attempts to read it through, not long before Thorpe's translation became available in 1974.) And Dalton's impressive scholarship (mainly from before World War I) is nearly a century out of date.<br /><br />(There is a volume of selections from the \\"History\\" and other books by Gregory, translated by Ernest Brehaut, reprinted several times, and excerpted on various websites. It was published in the Columbia University \\"Records of Civilization\\" series in -- I think --  1922; some sources say 1916. Gregory went on record opposing any excerpting or abridging of the \\"Ten Books\\" (and was right --  the longer stories are reduced to rubble ), but Brehaut's offering is still worth a look.)<br /><br />Thorpe is readily available, less expensive, and far more enjoyable. The weird and violent world of witchcraft-fearing, God-bribing, homicidal dynasts (sometimes compared to the Wild West, but without many White Hats) presents itself to the reader, with helpful notes along the way. A superb index also help sort out characters and events, which frequently are spread over several chapters or different books, as events unfolded before Gregory's eyes.<br /><br />Some medievalists have challenged the accuracy of Thorpe's translation. The examples I have seen look to me (a very amateur Latinist, to be sure) more like debatable interpretations than obvious errors. Thorpe does tend to prefer the clear and interesting, but questionable, reading of the original to the cautious but obscure one. A nautical historian will be concerned that Thorpe has Scandinavian *navi* (ships, or large boats) prepare to \\"sail back\\" instead of \\"turn back,\\" (*reverti*), because he suspects they were using oars, not sails. Most readers, for whom motor-driven vessels also \\"sail\\" from place to place, will not be aware of the distinction.<br /><br />If you need such precision (say, for a college-level course), checking a passage against Dalton, and if possible a well-edited Latin edition, would obviously be advisable. (There is an on-line Latin text, as \\"Historia Francorum,\\" which is helpful, but lacks information on variants and other important details found in full editions. Inevitably, Thorpe was not able to take advantage of the last quarter-century of scholarship, which has re-evaluated Gregory's methods, goals, and accomplishments, along with those of other early medieval historians and chroniclers. But Gregory's \\"History\\" is essential reading for anyone with a serious interest in early medieval Europe, particularly the early Germanic kingdoms, and Thorpe's translation is a fine entry into the field.as a brilliant discussion of Gregory's failures as a narrator, but fails to mention that the analysis is of a passage -- with inconsequential details of a minor quarrel leading up to a scandalous blood feud -- in which Gregory is reporting testimony given *in his own courtroom*.)

I have seen most of them, and read several with care, and I like Simpson's version a lot. Despite being a good reflection of Ovid's intensely sophisticated style, it is as clear as the Mary M. Innes prose translation of 1955, which was reprinted for decades in the Penguin Classics series (although at the moment it seems to have been displaced by a Penguin edition of Arthur Golding's Elizabethan verse translation, at least in the Penguin catalogue, if not on store shelves). [A verse translation by David Raeburn was released as a Penguin Classic in Auust 2004, and may -- or may not -- be its permanent replacement.]    The second part -- about half the volume by number of pages, probably much more in terms of wordage, given the slightly smaller typeface used -- is a running commentary on the poem, generally closely integrated with Simpson's rendering. This is in itself a departure from recent practice. There are a number of excellent stand-alone studies of the \\"Metamorphoses,\\" to which Simpson frequently refers the reader. There are commentaries of various ages on the Latin text (notably the recent volumes by William Anderson). Translations however, have generally contained much less comprehensive notes, and those with brief commentaries have tended to be \\"aides to the reader,\\" supplying the myth-deprived modern with essential information on the ancient gods (e.g., that Jove is another name for Jupiter, and Phoebus is the same person as Apollo). Simpson's commentary far exceeds in scope and ambition, as well as size, the otherwise impressive set of notes by E.J. Kenney to A.D. Melville's verse translation (1986; Oxford World's Classics), to take one example.     In fact, the only comparable joining of a \\"modern\\" English translation and extended commentary with which I am familiar is the combination of Brookes More's verse translation with surveys of Ovid's sources and his influence on later art and literature by Wilmon Brewer (1895-1998), which was also published separately as \\"Ovid's Metamorphoses in European Culture.\\" That translation-and-commentary appeared in five-book sections in 1933, 1941, and 1948, and the whole work was reprinted (somewhat \\"revised\\") as recently as 1978. Brewer's commentary remains interesting, but for understanding the poem it relies heavily on formerly current views about Ovid's supposed Hellenistic sources. By and large it amounts to a series of essays on the stories, rather than a close analysis of what Ovid does with them, and how he does it. (And, as it can be published separately, it is really another book about the poem, rather than a close commentary.)     Simpson is an authority on extant sources of Greek myths, and their subsequent literary developments -- see the commentary included in his translation of \\"The Library\\" of Apollodorus, published as \\"Gods and Heroes of the Greeks\\". In treating Ovid, however, Simpson usually notes only the most prominent of Ovid's literary predecessors, notably Homer, Hesiod, and Virgil, with whose versions of some of the stories Ovid's original audience would certainly have been familiar. Instead, he deals with Ovid's literary creation. Points of poetic style, and the moral and political implications of passages are covered. So are complex problems of the structure of the whole poem, and its parts, such as the tangle of cross-reference, tales told by characters in stories told by characters in Ovid's narrative. The result is an intriguing view of Ovid, not as a clever poet and skilled anthologist, but as a master of the narrative art.     The volume concludes with an exceptionally detailed index, which also serves as a concise glossary.    [Note: A very favorable review of this translation by Sara Mack, just now (September 30, 2004) available in the online \\"Bryn Mawr Classical Review,\\" reports that a revised edition of Simpson's \\"Metamorphoses\\" is forthcoming, sometime during the current (2004-2005?) academic year. This will apparently will include some substantive revisions, as well as correction of numerous typographical errors (many of which I seem to have read past without noticing). I would urge the curious to consult Mack's review for a professional Latinist's perspective on the problem of translating Ovid, as well as a far more authoritative evaluation of Simpson's work than I can provide.]	2004-04-26

What he undeniably found, in the seemingly unpromising records of the Inquisition, was evidence of beliefs so remote from those of official European culture as to be flatly unintelligible to the churchmen who first encountered them. Eventually, the Church courts managed to impose something resembling officially acceptable doctrines on the local population, but the process took generations, as Ginzburg is able to show from trial records.    Briefly, Ginzburg found that, in the Friuli district, there was a widespread belief that certain men and women were marked at birth as defenders against witches and demons, these being regarded mainly as the enemies of the people, their livestock, and their crops. The chosen defenders, the \\"Benandanti,\\" or \\"good walkers,\\" ventured forth in their dreams to do battle with the forces of evil. Those born with the mark of the Benandanti regarded themselves as good Christians, the allies of the Church. To those outside the local culture, this position was clearly nonsense; unauthorized and unsanctified supernatural power could only be Satanic in origin, and those who claimed to exercise it were, at best, dangerously deluded. In the end, if the court records are to be trusted, they persuaded even the Benandanti themselves that this was the case. At least, the \\"absurd\\" and \\"outrageous\\" testimony of self-described Benandanti fades from the records, to be replaced with conventional witch-beliefs endorsed by the Holy Office.    The official tendency, Catholic and Protestant, to lump local witch-doctors together with the witches they claimed to counter had long been recognized by historians. Ginzburg, however, discovered, and offered to surprised historians (in the original Italian edition of 1966), a stratum of belief that, when first recorded, seems to have been entirely outside the mainstream of medieval European culture. There is scattered evidence for similar concepts in other parts of Europe, and abundant evidence from other continents, but the connections and age of the beliefs in and about the Benandanti remain subjects for controversy. The demonstration that diverse local beliefs had been rendered uniform by the judicial process, and by intensive indoctrination of the \\"lower classes,\\" however, remains a landmark.    As described in the \\"Preface to the English Edition,\\" the Italian version rather quickly received favorable -- and some unfavorable or uncomprehending -- notice from historians of European witchcraft. It was interpreted, or perhaps misunderstoond, by Mircea Eliade, the influential figure in \\"History of Religions\\" at the University of Chicago, one of the great authorities on shamanism (and much else).  Although sections had been published in English earlier, the whole book became available in English in 1983, in the present translation, from Routledge & Kegan Paul in Britain, and Johns Hopkins University Press in the U.S. I first read it a few years later, and eventually acquired a copy of a Penguin Books re-issue of 1986. (All the English-language editions seem to differ only in cover art, besides the name of the publisher.) I have re-read it from time to time over the years. Although historical views of European witch-beliefs and popular culture have both been in flux, this book remains among the most fascinating in its crowded field.	2004-04-05

I have used it for both light reading and for serious study (while in courses on Baltic and Slavic Folklore and Folktale Studies). The selection and translation of stories both seem first-rate. (For the latter, I have had to rely on the opinions of those who  actually read Russian, instead of just having studied it in school.) The accompanying illustrations are properly enchanting -- and only occasionally are placed where they give away the point of the story.<br /><br />The only real drawback is that it is still merely a selection from about three volumes (depending on the edition you prefer) of \\"skazki.\\" This is the Russian term for oral tales of marvels, adventures, and misadventures, equivalent to the German \\"Maerchen.\\" In both cases, the English term \\"Fairy Tale\\" is the conventional, but not really adequate, translation. (As usual in large collections, only a handful of tales concern anything like fairies.) One of the requirements for the selection seems to have been that the tales chosen should be acceptable to American parents in the 1940s, but otherwise the considerable variety of the original seems to have been largely preserved. The suggested reader age of  \\"9 to 12\\" conceals the pleasure that adult readers with interests in folklore or Russian culture will derive from the volume. Fortunately, they may be lead to it by the fine supplementary material at the end, although this is now half a century old.<br /><br />Afanas'ev (various transliterations) was one of the many nineteenth-century collectors inspired by the Grimms,. By most accounts he was one of the most responsible, even though his practices of recording and documenting texts are hardly up to modern standards.

The main collection from which this was excerpted was the sourcebook for Vladimir Propp's \\"Morphology of the Folktale,\\" a key work in modern folktale studies, but as Roman Jakobson (yes, the Structural Linguist) points out in his commentary to this collection, the book had already established itself as a gem of Russian literature, an inspiration and resource for poets.he Folktale,\\" a key work in modern folktale studies, but as Roman Jakobson (yes, the Structural Linguist) points out in his commentary to this collection, the book had already established itself as a gem of Russian literature, an inspiration and resource for poets.	2004-04-02

The late Poul Anderson warns the reader that he is using &#34;facts&#34; about some of the characters which have only a limited connection to historical probability, even discounting the frankly supernatural elements. From either point of view, I consider the book an astonishing success. It is well worth the time, and for the uninitiated in saga-literature, the effort probably needed to read it through.<br /><br />I say astonishing because, despite my very great admiration for Poul Anderson, I had some misgivings about this project. Anderson was setting himself some stiff competition. Gunnhild, the &#34;Mother of Kings,&#34; figures prominently in at least three major medieval works: Snorri Sturluson's &#34;Heimskringla&#34; (a history of the kings of Norway); &#34;The Saga of Egil Skallagrimsson&#34; (which some have thought to be Snorri's work, and which is a biography of one of his ancestors); and, more briefly, but equally memorably, in &#34;The Saga of Burnt Njal.&#34; In all of these she figures both as a queen and as a sorceress, and in the last especially as a dangerous lover of younger men.<br /><br />Each of these works has been translated into English several times. Translators of the first include William Morris, and of the second E.R. Eddison, both major fantasy writers. Those familiar with Eddison's &#34;Worm Ouroboros&#34; will probably remember the passage from George W. Dasent's translation of &#34;Njal's Saga&#34; which is read aloud in the opening pages. Three original works of genius, all of which happen to be closely associated with the development of fantasy literature in English. Not exactly minor predecessors. (Gunnhild also shows up in other sagas, including accounts of the kings of Norway by otherhands, and, in a passage parallel to the account in &#34;Njal,&#34; in the great &#34;Laxdaela Saga,&#34; but these appearances are, I think, of lesser literary importance. The two-volume 1860 edition of Dasent's &#34;Burnt Njal&#34; included an essay on medieval accounts of Gunnhild, now very obsolete, but interesting to compare to Anderson; single-volume reprintings of Dasent's translation omit this, along with the rest of Dasent's elaborate introduction and appendices.)<br /><br />I was not, however, completely surprised by how successful I found the book to be. Anderson had reworked Icelandic literature in the past, including Snorri's account of a later Norwegian king, Harald Hard-Counsel (in &#34;The Last Viking&#34; trilogy), and the legendary &#34;Hrolf Kraki's Saga,&#34; and retold the story of the Volsungs in science fiction terms in &#34;Time Patrolman,&#34; before turning to divine mythology (and the relatively obscure accounts of Saxo Grammaticus) in &#34;War of the Gods.&#34; He virtually began his career by extending the legendary sagas in &#34;The Broken Sword.&#34; In none of these cases, though, were the originals quite so intimidating. He had not lost his touch in &#34;Mother of Kings,&#34; despite the length of the story, and the complexity of the histories and legends he was working with.	2004-03-27

The Sawyer translation of Wang Chen's T'ang Dynasty commentary on &quot;Lao Tzu&quot; (the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;) as a guide to military and civil policy has been reissued in paperback by Westview (2003), as &quot;The Tao of War,&quot; with Ralph D. Sawyer's name more prominently displayed than Wang Chen's, and a catalogue of Westview editions of Sawyer's books as an appendix of &quot;Further Reading.&quot; <br />I have reviewed the Westview edition at greater length. Both editions consist of a translation of each of the eighty-one short chapters of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, as understood by Wang Chen, followed by Wang Chen's commentary, and a modern explication of Wang Chen. General Wang Chen's book was written around 800 C.E., and is a departure from the better-known religious and philosophical readings of the Taoist classic. As Sawyer points out, however, it agrees in basic approach, if not in details, with a number of modern attempts to understand the book as a product of the Warring States period, and concerned with problems of society and government.<br />NOTE: The present volume should NOT be confused with a book by Diane Dreher, variously published as &quot;The Tao of Peace: A Modern Guide to the Ancient Way of Peace and Harmony ,&quot; and &quot;The Tao of Inner Peace: A Guide to Inner and Outer Peace.&quot;	2004-03-26

The Westview Press version is a little harder to recognize for what it is.    In both versions, it is in fact a translation, with an introduction and commentary by the translators, of \\"Tao-te-Ching lun-ping yao-yi-shu,\\" one of the more unusual of the many surviving Chinese commentaries on the \\"Tao Te Ching\\" or \\"Lao-Tzu.\\" (\\"Daodejing\\" and \\"Laozi\\" in the current Pinyin transliteration; the Sawyers continue to use the familiar Wade-Giles system.)  The \\"5000-character Classic\\" (as it is also known, and as Wang Chen sometimes cites it)  was of exceptional importance to the T'ang; the supposed author was officially an ancestor of the dynasty, the Chinese roots of which were often questioned.    The Westview edition has been repackaged, slightly revised in references to the title, and expanded by a section of \\"Further Reading\\" which is in effect a catalogue of the translators' other books on Chinese military thought for Westview, rather than for study of the \\"Tao-Te-Ching.\\" (For some suggestions, see below.)    Ralph D. Sawyer explains in the Preface that they have also provided a translation of the \\"Tao-Te-Ching\\" itself, which uses Wang Chen's apparent readings and parsing of the text, and so differs from the many earlier translations, and from the Sawyers' own understanding of the book. Each of the eighty-one chapters consists of a passage of the Lao-Tzu, Wang Chen's explanation of its application, and the translators' explication of its (mainly military and political) context and significance.    The two alternative titles of the translation reflect the thrust of Wang Chen's commentary equally well, although the choice seems to reflectthe markets served by the two publishers. As is the case with many Shambhala publications, the volume is rather thin on references, although Sawyer's Preface does mention some important translations of the \\"Tao Te Ching.\\" Since he explains that the book is directed at ordinary readers, he might have expanded some of these brief comments in the Preface -- the ordinary reader may not be familiar with, say, the difference between the Ho Shang Kung and Wang Pi texts of Lao-Tzu, which he mentions in passing. (These are two early commentaries, whose approaches and textual readings mark the religious and philosophical approaches to the book; the received \\"Wang Pi\\" *text* of Lao-tzu, by the way, seems not to correspond completely to the one implied in his commentary! For relevant bibliography, see below.)    Wang Chen and his \\"commentary\\" are the main focus of the book. The Sawyers attempt to show how the general connects his views to a book usually treated from religious and philosophical perspectives. The question of whether Wang Chen is correctly interpreting his canonical text is, of course, of no great concern. The commentary is a common form for expressing original ideas in many cultures with strong text-based traditions, Hebrew and Sanskrit, for example, as well as Chinese. This commentary is an attempt to find a consistent basis for humane and effective government. It was intended to replace the T'ang tendency for random shifting between ruthless interventionism and quietist failure to govern. Whether this instability in policy was a cause of the dynasty's difficulties, or a dangerous symptom, is another matter. Having a contemporary analysis of the dynasty's problems is only part of the book's considerable interest.    The secondary literature on the Taoist classic is very large, and the number of translations continues to grow. The Sawyers' work offers an unexpected reading, and does not require a wider knowledge of the base text to be appreciated on its own terms.    Those seriously interested in the textual problems of the \\"Tao-Te-Ching\\" can now consult the recent technical edition and translation by Rudolf G. Wagner, \\"A Chinese Reading of the Daodejing: Wang Bi's Commentary on the Laozi with Critical Text and Translation\\" (2003). Together with Wagner's \\"The Craft of a Chinese Commentator: Wang Bi on the Laozi\\" (2000), and \\"Language, Ontology, and Political Philosophy in China: Wang Bi's Scholarly Exploration of the Dark (Xuanxue)\\" (2003) it was published in the State University of New York (SUNY) Press \\"Chinese Philosophy and Culture\\" series. They are significantly more difficult than \\"The Tao of War,\\" or almost any of the readily available translations of Lao-tzu.    SUNY had also published Alan K. L. Chan's \\"Two Visions of the Way: A Study of the Wang Pi and the Ho-shang Kung Commentaries on the Lao-Tzu,\\" in its older \\"Series in Chinese Philosophy\\" (1991), which, although slightly antiquated, offers a fascinating comparison of two of the earliest of the competing philosophical, political, and religious interpretations, to which Wang Chen was adding.	2004-03-26
US	30081986	R1I04X0M8YEBAJ	0252006356	513029830	The Peasants of Languedoc	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Economic and Social History	Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, the author of \\"The Peasants of Languedoc,\\" is a French historian whose works have had considerable exposure in English. The fascinating \\"Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error\\" (and alternate titles; 1975, translation 1978) may be the best-known of his works, as well as the most controversial among historians, based as it is on village gossip recorded by Inquisitors. Perhaps more representative are detailed studies of a popular demonstration / riot in \\"Carnival in Romans\\" (\\"Le Carnaval de Romans,\\" 1979), and of folktale themes as transmitted in popular and literary versions from the south of France, in \\"Love, Death and Money in the Pays D'Oc\\" (\\"L'argent, l'amour et la mort en pays d'Oc,\\" 1980), in which social stresses and personal anxieties come together.    Underlying much of this production, however, and perhaps giving Ladurie the confidence to interpret the notoriously difficult inquisitorial records, is this less-inspiring sounding early work, \\"Les Paysans de Languedoc\\" of 1966, here translated under an equally plain and literal title, which appeared in English only three years after the original French edition. In any case, it clearly underlies his later investigations of provincial culture and society.    This is a sophisticated analysis of primarily economic records from one of the traditional provinces of southern France, covering mainly the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. It deals with the basics of ordinary life -- production, consumption, property, and taxes, and how they interacted. There are interesting confirmations of what can go wrong when people act without much guidance from economic theory in determining self-interest. For example, wide-spread cutting of wages in a time of rising prices reduced income and purchases, ultimately putting meat beyond the reach of most consumers. This was a catastrophe for some of the same employers, who were cattle-raisers (or owners of grazing land) with a diminishing market. (If I understand Ladurie's tables and charts correctly -- and this involves some interpretation on the part of a non-professional -- the typical response to their falling profits was to cut wages again, again reducing the cash in circulation, and reinforcing the cycle in a time when markets for most goods, especially perishable ones, were strictly local.)    It is definitely not light reading, but Ladurie is not above adding characterizations (such as \\"tight-fisted fellows\\") to otherwise anonymous groups of property-owners and employers, sacrificing a little of the appearance of objectivity for the sake of human interest. Generally speaking, Ladurie draws such positions from the hard data, and the attentive reader may well reach the same conclusion; I remain happier about the practice from a literary point of view than an historical one.     \\"Peasants of Languedoc\\" represents a major move toward understanding the history of people left out of official histories, although the original description as \\"total history\\" is rather misleading. Taken together with Ladurie's later cultural studies, however, it does mark a considerable advance.	2004-03-08
US	30081986	R2BZQ0G5OCYZXL	8121509491	330462958	Vedic Mythology	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Compact Reference	This is a systematic presentation of the divine, human, animal and natural (plants, rivers, clouds, etc.) figures in early Sanskrit literature (mainly the Rig Veda, the Atharva Veda, and the early Brahmanas), with the small number of narratives which actually appear in the early hymns, and some information from medieval Sanskrit commentators. (Technically, some of this is in pre-Sanskrit Vedic, not the systematized Sanskrit of the Indian grammatical tradition....)  The much more elaborate narratives of the Epics and Puranas are not treated as such, and it is NOT a presentation of Hinduism as a living religion; those who want either one will be disappointed. The result is in many cases a list of epithets and attributes, and of family members, enemies, and rivals, at considerable remove in style from the lyrics from which the information has been gathered. It is a place to start looking for data, and is a guide to some (hardly all) of the contents of an extremely difficult body of ancient literature.  Although written in English, it was originally published in 1897-1898 as a part of a German publisher's series of monographs on what would now be called Indo-European Studies. Macdonnell was a leading scholar in his time, and his technical studies continue to be cited with respect. The book is now showing its age, and a replacement would be welcome, but as its second century begins it remains extremely helpful.  (At least to someone who wants a concise overview of a huge amount of scattered material.) The proportion of hard data to theory is very high. Macdonnell's work was able to survive changing fashions, and, to judge from citations and bibliographies, was used happily by rival schools of interpretation right through the twentieth century. A rather heavy dependence on nature-mythology (especially solar) seems to show direct dependence on the great commentator Sayana as least as much as on Max Mueller's modern extensions of it, as one would expect of the author's mastery of the sources.  The Sanskrit index is quite comprehensive, and supplements the analytical arrangement of the material. Unfortunately, it lacks an index of texts cited. (In frustration at flipping pages to see if Macdonnell had mentioned a passage which did not have a major name, nor a word for which I somehow happened to know the Sanskrit, I once compiled my own index of his Rig Veda citations. I do not recommend this course to others!) The bibliographical material is, of course, long obsolete. The cautious reader will try to check Macdonnell's etymologies against modern works. He seems to have been fairly careful about accepting speculations not grounded in Sanskrit texts (not rushing to identify Vata and Wodan, for example), but of course, even the great Sanskrit grammarians were sometimes wrong....  The copy I have used for years was printed in India, by a different publisher, with a date of 1974. The paper has not stood up well to the passing decades, and I hope that more recent reprintings will prove more durable. As long as a copy is clearly printed and complete, however, and so long as the reader keeps its limits in mind, the book should be an extremely useful tool.	2004-02-29
US	30081986	R3IN9HS54FQ4TT	0195297512	454378992	The Jewish Study Bible: Featuring The Jewish Publication Society TANAKH Translation	Books	5	713	750	N	Y	Ian Myles Slater on: Is Up To Date Enough?	I held back from submitting a review until I had worked my way through this hefty volume (or rather, its original material, as I was very familiar with the translation), so I might as well address some of the issues raised in the meantime.     At least some of the earlier reviewers seem originally to have been under the impression that the base text of this commentary was the Jewish Publication Society translation of 1917 (and not happy to find out that it wasn't). That translation (JPS or JPSV for short) was itself a de facto revision of the British Revised Version of 1885, carried out under the direction of (and largely the work of) Max L. Margolis, a distinguished critical scholar. (He had a known distaste for organized religion, which probably helped him ignore objections from some of his supposed colleagues in the Rabbinate.) It *was* the base text in the Soncino Bible Commentary, and the second edition of the Hertz Pentateuch, used in Synagogues for decades, and for a series of commentaries on specific books, published by the JPS itself. The Old JPS \\"Holy Scriptures\\" in its black-bound small format was for me, as for many other Jewish readers in the United States (and elsewhere), the primary introduction to the Bible. (For further details, the essay on Jewish Bible translations in the present volume may be consulted.)    The 1917 text was reprinted in larger format in 1955, with what may be called (out of courtesy) a \\"distinctive\\" orange binding, but a very attractive blue dust jacket. It retained the original title of \\"The Holy Scriptures according to the Masoretic text: A new translation with the aid of previous versions and with constant consultation of Jewish authorities,\\" although it wasn't \\"new.\\" Both versions often can can be found used. A version based on this re-set printing can be consulted on-line, as \\"A Hebrew - English Bible According to the Masoretic Text and the JPS 1917 Edition\\" from Mechon Mamre. (The Hebrew text offered there is not presentedto either traditional or modern critical standards, but is suitable for most purposes.)     \\"The Jewish Study Bible\\" is, in fact, based on the *replacement* for this familiar version, published between 1962 and 1982, often known as the New Jewish Publication Society Version (NJPSV). The Old JPS version, however, was reprinted for some time, fortunately for those who found the NJPSV gratingly modern, or just bland and rather abstract in its choice of words. It is important to keep the two versions distinct, however, as they were carried out following different principles of translation, and have very a different \\"feel\\".     The New Translation (now a few decades old) differs dramatically in using modern, instead of modified King James Version, English, in both vocabulary and, more radically, in sentence structure. With its various revisions in 1985 and subsequently, it has the advantage of nearly a century of additional scholarship, especially in archeology and ancient languages. Instead of being stamped with the influence of one strong-minded scholar, it was hammered out by committees of scholars, including representatives of the (modern) Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform movements. The NJPSV has served as the basis of Reform and Conservative one-volume Torah commentaries, of a JPS five-volume Torah commentary, and of JPS commentaries on various books which are appearing at intervals. The whole translation is also available facing a very beautiful Hebrew text, with selected Masoretic (traditional textual) notes.    Although some sections (Genesis, Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others) were first published separately, the translation mainly appeared in three volumes of Torah (Five Books of Moses), Nevi'im (Prophets -- the main historical books and the \\"writing Prophets\\"), and Ketuvim (Writings -- everything else, including Ruth, Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, Lamentations, and Daniel, classed as historical or prophetic by Christians). This is the Jewish canon, known by the acronym of T-N-Kh. Officially, the complete edition is known as \\"Tanakh: A New Translation of the Holy Scriptures According to the Traditional Hebrew Text,\\" with the Hebrew-English editions known as \\"JPS Hebrew-English Tanakh\\" (and variations, which may require a little searching on Amazon). NJPSV is still the common abbreviation, however.    Although the translation has been challenged at many points on technical grounds -- with the translators themselves joining in -- Emanuel Tov's \\"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible\\" (1992) singled it out for its fidelity to the received text (any departures are clearly identified), and independence of earlier translations, adding, rather more boldly, that \\"its exegesis is reliable.\\" Beyond its reception in Jewish circles, the NJPSV seems to have influenced the \\"New Revised Standard Version\\" of 1990, whether as a model, or because the translation committees had an overlapping membership.     There are other recent Jewish translations, complete or in progress, some from resolutely Orthodox perspectives, others, like Richard Elliott Friedman's, embracing Higher Critical analysis. A major attempt, by Everett Fox, to follow the Hebrew text as closely as possible while still being intelligible as English, differs quite radically from the NJPSV in style, although often in agreement on the meaning where they both depart from familiar phrasing; it is appearing in installments as \\"The Schocken Bible.\\"     The present commentary, covering the whole Jewish Biblical canon, aims to place the Jewish Bible, as a Jewish text, in the context of modern information, and modern critical theories of various kinds. It is, logically enough, based on what is now the mostly widely used *modern* Jewish English translation.    Obviously, this project will not please those who want to think of the Hebrew text as a revelation dictated to human secretaries, and satisfactorily explained by the great medieval commentators and their latter-day synthesizers, whose views need only be copied (selectively). However, the team which has prepared this commentary, like the team of translators, is extremely aware of Jewish issues, and the kinds of questions Jewish readers are likely to have, even if it does not attempt to give Orthodox answers. (For example, Jonathan Klawans' essay on \\"Concepts of Purity in the Bible\\" manages to be clear, accurate, insightful, and probably useful to novice Bible readers -- with a good vocabulary or dictionary -- in a mere seven pages; but it is not a guide to observance of traditional Jewish practices.)    In addition to the annotations to the Biblical text, which are themselves of considerable value, there are excellent essays offerings surveys of scholarship from various points of view, of which those under the heading \\"Jewish Interpretations of the Bible\\" might well be read first by those with a limited familiarity with this enormous subject, and can probably be read profitably by advanced students as well.     The results are at times strikingly different from those found in the other Oxford Annotated Bibles, and in other one-volume commentaries, such as the avowedly ecumenical \\"HarperCollins Study Bible.\\" A typical example of the difference in emphasis in the three volumes is the commentary to the second chapter of \\"Ezra,\\" which in this case includes information, not found in the others, on early Rabbinic understanding of the extent of Ezra's status and authority as a non-prophetic interpreter of Torah, seen as foreshadowing their own. (Rather as a commentary on \\"Acts\\" might note its use in controversies over the organization of the Church.)    However, even besides material such as maps and portions of essays from the recent \\"New Oxford Annotated Bible: Third Edition,\\" there is also a very high degree of similarity in the information in the notes, due to the large amount of commonly received linguistic and material (archeological and other) information with which modern scholarship is conducted. (And perhaps to the presence of Jewish contributors to the other projects, including some whose work is also found in the present commentary.)     (The \\"Oxford Annotated Bible\\" series was based on the mainly American Revised Standard Version, and more recently on the New Revised Standard Version. Confusingly, there is also a 1992 \\"Oxford Study Bible,\\" edited by Katherine Doob Sakenfeld, which is based on the Revised English Bible of 1989, a version of the New English Bible of 1970, which had a Study Edition in 1976. The recent editions of these \\"Annotated\\" and \\"Study\\" Bibles have, I think, only one contributor in common.)    Although those looking for an Orthodox Jewish approach are likely to be disappointed, if not outraged, traditional Jewish understandings of the text are drawn upon, to a considerably greater degree than in other general commentaries, and some, at least, of the Jewish liturgical uses of Biblical passages are identified, either in essays, or in notes to the passages in their original contexts. As I am sure will be true of every reader with a wide background in Biblical studies, I have a number of points with which I disagree. But I am enormously impressed by the enterprise as a whole.	2004-02-27

The exact list of poems included varies slightly, with editors and translators having a little leeway. The \\"World's Classics\\" series from Oxford University Press finally included a translation of this famous collection in its list in 1997; it has since been reprinted in the slightly refurbished and renamed series of \\"Oxford World's Classics.\\"<br /><br />{Perhaps I should add that, like five earlier reviewers, I have taken for granted the importance and high literary quality of the Elder Edda, and concentrated on whether this particular translation is worth your time -- and money.}<br /><br />Although some reviewers have complained that Carolyne Larrington's translation is inaccurate, it has been favorably received by the academic community on the grounds of its exceptional accuracy. (It is on a Cambridge University syllabus too, although this may reflect, in part, its availability.)<br /><br />Part of the problem may be that Larrington is following the 1983 revision of the Neckel-Kuhn text edition, without giving specific notice of all of its decisions on how to resolve contradictions in the manuscript evidence. (A reader who consults the notes at the end will find some of them, particularly regarding the ordering of stanzas.) Most previous translators produced eclectic versions, based on a variety of older editions, and often noting their own departures from the then-standard text editions. For those without access to the latest revised version of Kuhn's revision of Neckel's turn-of-the-century critical edition, Larrington's departures from the familiar are likely to seem arbitrary.<br /><br />She also seems to be making full use of the latest in linguistic scholarship -- another reason for departing from familiar readings.<br /><br />Of course, some of her translations may well be wrong -- translators have to make decisions among various options, and the format of this book does not allow for full discussions of such problems. Some problems have no easy answer; for example, there are lists of names, most of which, but not all, were chosen for their obvious meanings; should any of them be translated in the main text? I found many points on which I would differ, preferring the arguments advanced by other scholars, but any other amateur, but enthusiastic, reader could probably come up with an entirely different list. I appreciate having her version available.<br /><br />What I find a more serious problem is that the translation is not really all that pleasant to read, and, although valuable to the serious student, is not likely to attract the merely curious. Despite being set up in stanzas, it is extremely prosy. This was probably the result of a decision to prefer precision to literary form, but, after comparing translations of sample passages going back to William Morris in the nineteenth century, I can't say that I am completely convinced. I could be wrong; I would not be astonished to find that someone fell in love with Old Norse literature through this version. But I do think that some older versions would serve this purpose better, despite many shortcomings, due in part to age.<br /><br />I offer, as examples, two other complete versions in English. Henry Adams Bellows' translation (from the American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1923) was at least interesting to read aloud, despite numerous shortcomings, both as a translation and as poetry. (It was out of print, except in a very expensive limited edition, but was available in digital form, and is being reprinted in its original two-volume format, at a much more reasonable price, by Dover; as of summer 2004, \\"Mythological Poems\\" has appeared.)  Lee M. Hollander's attempt at an alliterative verse rendering (University of Texas, also 1923, second edition, 1962, and still in print in paperback) is sometimes a little hard to follow, but at least the reader is kept aware that the original is a metrical composition. (I once worked through a good part of Hollander's text-edition-for-students of \\"Seven Eddic Lays,\\" so his translation seems to me comparatively clear -- and, allowing for some liberties due to meter, mostly very accurate, since it matches his editing and glossary!) Larrington's stanza divisions, by comparison, seem to be there strictly as points of reference.<br /><br />Curiously, neither of these translations is mentioned, so far as I can see, anywhere in the present volume; nor is another, more recent, American translation, by Patricia Terry, which has undergone several revised printings. Larrington discusses in detail translations published in Britain, which is fair enough; but she somehow omits the expanded edition of Auden and Taylor's \\"The Elder Edda: A Selection\\" as \\"Norse Poems\\" (1981), which does contain the whole standard Eddic \\"canon.\\"<br /><br />(It should be added that \\"The Poetry of the Elder Edda,\\" by Andy Orchard, announced some time ago as forthcoming in Penguin Classics, has yet to appear, as of Fall 2005; some on-line sources now list it for Spring 2008! The first part of a five-volume text, translation and commentary by Ursula Dronke was published in 1969, but only reached the second -- superb -- volume in 1997, with nothing since.

US	30081986	R2W2ELILMJKHTW	0415921295	300381057	The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle	Books	5	91	93	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Great Replacement	\\"The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\\" is the collective name for a whole set of chronicles, originally scattered across England. Arranged mainly year-by-year, they contain contemporary, or purportedly contemporary, accounts of important events: wars, the deaths of kings, bishops, and popes, and some interesting poems about such events.<br /><br />They are clearly derived from a single original form, but show considerable variation, due to different scribal practices and where and when they were copied and continued. Information in one copy can often be supplemented or corrected from another, allowing a better glimpse of \\"Dark Age\\" England. They are mainly in Old English, but some have Latin entries, and there are medieval translations into Latin. (The fact that chronicles were *not* kept in Latin was unusual, and suggests that King Alfred was right about the poor state of learning in Viking-assaulted England.) It has been recognized since Elizabethan times as an important work, and one or another manuscript served as the basis of series of translations into English since the nineteenth century. Eventually, efforts were made to present two or more manuscripts together, producing a new round of translations.<br /><br />This translation was originally published by J.M. Dent in 1996, and intended as a replacement for that publisher's Everyman's Library \\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\\" translation of 1953, the highly-regarded, and often disliked, work of Norman Garmonsway. Highly regarded, because it was very accurate and followed the layout of a standard text edition of 1892, which displayed the considerable variety among the manuscripts. This layout allowed the student referring to a copy of Earle and Plummer's edition to find the appropriate passage in the original language with little effort. Disliked, because the same arrangement is very hard to follow, and the small print in the notes and index was annoyingly hard to read. The 1953 edition was revised in 1954, and issued in paperbackin the 1970s with a few bibliographic updates. It was a state-of-knowledge treasure at the time, but an explosion in historical and archeological work in the following decades made it ever more creaky with age. My copy of the paperback is falling apart from use, some of that use a matter of getting used to the layout -- I share both views about it. [2012: I've reviewed a digital incarnation -- Kindle and iBook that I know of -- of Garmonsway.]<br /><br />Well, those who disliked the layout will have to try reading a single-text or composite translation, instead of this one. Michael Swanton has preserved the 1892 placement of the text. Fortunately, his translation seems as precise as Garmonsway's -- a statement I feel qualified to make, having worked through the Chronicle texts in \\"Bright's Old English Reader\\" and several other student's editions. On the whole, it is, I think, more readable (although I miss the old phrasing in a few passages). The pages are physically larger, and so is the type, (although the notes are still just below my comfort level), and the genealogical tables and maps are both easy to read and detailed enough to be useful.<br /><br />[2012 update: The composite translation I had in mind, and somehow failed to mention, is that  edited by Dorothy Whitelock, in the revised edition of 1961. Since it gives major variants in parallel columns, and minor ones in footnotes, it is really no easier to follow, and not as convenient for use with a standard text edition -- on which see below.]<br /><br />Sooner or later, of course, Swanton's annotations will begin to show their age too, although the technology of the next fifty years may allow more frequent and more radical improvements in published works than was possible in the twentieth century. Meanwhile, a collaborative edition of all the texts is in the process of publication, and a new understanding of the growth of the Chronicle may emerge, suggesting new ways of arranging and presenting the material. For now, however, Michael Swanton has provided an essential tool -- and buried in it is a lot of good reading.<br /><br />[2012 update. The three volumes of Earle-revised-by-Plummer \\"Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel\\" are available for downloading from archive.org. Of the several formats offered, pdf is probably the most reliable -- no OCR problems with a text with strange characters and made up of obsolete words and forms.]	2004-02-05
US	30081986	R36N74KS1DU0ZK	0801853621	15163476	Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources, Vol. 2	Books	5	39	39	N	Y	Ian Myles Slater on: Invaluable Analysis	Anyone who expects this book (in either the one-volume hardcover original, or the slightly-revised two-volume paperback) to be a complete account of Greek Myths, with or without their Roman adaptations, has missed the \\"Early\\" and the \\"Guide to ... Sources\\" in the title.    It is not a substitute for H.J. Rose's old \\"A Handbook of Greek Mythology, Including Its Extension to Rome,\\" or Kerenyi's \\"Gods of the Greeks\\" and \\"Heroes of the Greeks,\\" or Tripp's dictionary-style \\"Handbook of Classical Mythology,\\" or Robert Graves' well-known, but eccentric, and not always reliable, \\"The Greek Myths.\\" If you *need* comprehensive accounts, including at least some Roman stories, Rose and Tripp are excellent; Kerenyi concentrates on Greek subjects, and draws as exclusively as he can on Greek sources.    \\"Early Greek Myth\\" is a very detailed analysis of the evidence for stories of gods and heroes which are attested in *early* sources -- Aeschylus and the early Sophocles are Gantz's preferred demarcation. Unfortunately, as everyone who has looked into the matter is only too aware, most of the best evidence is missing, and the scholar is forced to turn to later -- sometimes much later -- summaries, quotations, and retellings which claim to be based on such early sources. A good deal of time-specific information comes from art, which often is archeologically and stylistically datable (the well-studied sequence of Athenian painted vases is constantly cited), but not always reliable as a direct reflection of a lost poem or play.    Gantz is meticulous, and presents an extremely balanced view of controversies, although he obviously favors some solutions to problems of interpretation. I have been reading Greek myths, and about them, for decades, and his accomplishment dazzles me. It is not easy reading, and sometimes slow going -- particularly if you stop to find in other books the pictures described this un-illustrated volume. (Of course, an illustrated version would be priced out of sight -- but it doesn't help that the references for art objects give only their \\"official\\" or \\"standard\\" publications, likely to be found in major libraries, but not on an ordinary reader's shelf.)    Among the available illustrated narrative accounts of Greek myths, Kerenyi's sparse but reliable treatments include some of the famous or intriguing vase paintings Gantz cites. Those two volumes (not Kerenyi's analytical and interpretive studies) might be the best companion for a reader baffled by Gantz's allusions to famous stories and obscure sources. Those intrigued by the problems posed by the artistic treatments will probably want to look at Thomas H. Carpenter's \\"Art and Myth in Ancient Greece: A Handbook\\" (1991), richly illustrated and probably not too technical to follow, before going on to, say, John Boardman's splendid popular volumes on ancient Greek art forms, in which mythology is of lesser concern.    Many of the best-known stories are absent from Gantz, or mentioned only in passing, for the simple reason that there is no early evidence for them. Some actually appear only in Roman times, sometimes exclusively in Latin, as do some of the best-known versions of stories once told in very different terms. In fact, there may be a place for similar modern studies of *Late* Greek Myths, and of Greek myths in Latin sources. [Note: Alan Cameron's \\"Greek Mythography in the Roman World\\" (American Classical Studies, No. 48), published in 2004, looked like it might fill the gap, but apparently analyzes specific texts in great detail.] But what Gantz has provided here is remarkable enough.    (Addendum; Professor Timothy Nolan Gantz passed away on January 20, 2004; a charming obituary appeared in The Georgia Classicist, Vol. XXV, No. I, which can be found on-line.)    [Further Addendum, February 2015: H.J. Rose's venerable \\"Handbook of Greek Mythology\\" has been revised and expanded by Robin Hard, in an edition published in 2003. A further revision is scheduled for release in hardcover in March 2015 (at what seems to me an unreasonably high price for a work addressed largely to students; presumably a future paperback edition will be less prohibitively expensive).]	2004-02-02
US	30081986	RVAEQB4S8H4I5	1570626227	434212413	The Superhuman Life of Gesar of Ling	Books	5	26	26	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A New Incarnation of an Old Favorite	The present work is a translation of a book originally published in French as \\"La vie Surhumaine de Guesar de Ling le Heros Thibetain, racontee par les bardes de son pays\\" in 1931 (and reprinted under shorter variants of the title), and in English in 1933 by Ryder & Co., London (reprinted 1959) and in 1934 by Claude Kendall, New York, as by Alexandra David-Neel and the Lama Yongden, and translated \\"with the collaboration of Violet Sydney.\\" (The description of the translation from Tibetan at the end of David-Neel's 35-page Introduction does not go into details on the turning of French into English. The results are, at least, quite readable.)<br /><br />I originally became acquainted with Gesar in the 1960s through a rather dingy-looking rebound library copy of the 1934 edition, and was delighted to find it, years later, in a crisp-looking paperback reprint, with a new foreword (by Chogyam Trungpa, who presumably finds the translation acceptable), but otherwise unchanged.<br /><br />For those not interested in problems of Tibetan history, and the mutual adaptations of Tibetan civilization and Buddhism, the story is more than worth reading as an heroic romance. (Which is how I originally came to it, along with Cuchulain, Finn, and pre-Malory versions of Arthur and Lancelot). There have been some other books on Gesar published in recent years, some including interesting additional material, but the other popular retellings seem at least partly dependant on the doubly-translated David-Neel prose version of his stories. (Which were actually told in verse, and can reasonably be described as a series of epics.)<br /><br />That there is no comparable one-volume version in English is not surprising. There is in fact no complete \\"canonical\\" version in Tibetan to translate; instead, many tellings of episodes and sequences of episodes have been recovered, in written or oral form. David-Neel and her Tibetan associates came up with a reasonably connected story. Until a qualified student of Tibetan language and literature produces a representative selection of these texts in English of manageable length, the David-Neel version will have to satisfy the curiosity of the rest of us. What may be the third volume of the major \\"Library of Tibet\\" Gesar translation project, directed by Robin Kornman, was in fact scheduled for publication in January 2004. There are also tantalizing reports of Kornman's projected 800-page version of the Gesar story for Penguin, which as a single volume would be a good replacement for David-Neel. This has apparently been scheduled for publication in late November of -- 2007!*<br /><br />Fortunately, the version available is highly enjoyable. It offers the reader a self-consciously Buddhist treatment of the story of a military hero, a fighter and conqueror who is presented as an incarnate defender of the Dharma, and Tibet, against a variety of essentially demonic enemies. In this way, the ethos of the old Tibetan royal and noble dynasties is adjusted to the ideology of Mahayana Buddhism, and the traditions of the Vajrayana schools which prevailed in Tibet.<br /><br />Gesar's story, in this account, is set motion by Padmasambhava, the \\"Lotus-Born Sage\\" and \\"Precious Guru\\" who is regarded the \\"Apostle of Tibet,\\" and one of its supernatural guardians. This wonder-working Bodhisattva recognizes that the time has come to beget a mighty hero, to oppose a previously vanquished demon, now triply-incarnated in human forms, and sets about the accomplishment of this goal. (Yes, it *does* sound a bit like Joss Whedon's original version of the Chosen One and her Watcher, reborn through the ages to defend humanity!) It is not merely an ordinary biography, therefore, but covers the hero's previous existence as a higher being, and the circumstances of his conception and birth, as seen from an essentially divine point of view.<br /><br />Whether you are looking for entertainment or edification, the open-minded reader should find it worthwhile.<br /><br />*Update, April 2013: Robin Kornman's translation is in at least three volumes, and will appear from Shambhala, not Penguin. Volume One, \\"The Epic of Gesar of Ling: Gesar's Magical Birth, Early Years, and Coronation as King,\\" is scheduled for official release July 9, 2013. The hardcover editions, at least, will be expensive; I'm waiting for a paperback printing!<br />In the meantime (that is, while I've been ignoring this review), Christopher Pennick has produced a three-volume retelling, under the series title of THE SONGS AND DEEDS OF GESAR, KING OF LING (2009-2011). The individual volumes are: \\"Warrior Song of King Gesar,\\" \\"Crossings on a Bridge of Light,\\" and \\"The Brilliance of Naked Mind.\\" All three are available in reasonably-priced Kindle editions.	2004-02-02
US	30081986	R2258Y5UHL9WHK	0850529735	547737789	Black Ship	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Most Irregular Affair	By what seems to have been an odd working of coincidence, in 1963 two books were published on mutinies in the British Navy which took place in 1797. I will describe both events, because some earlier reviewers seem to have been rather unclear about the context of the account of one of them by the popular nautical historian and novelist, Dudley Pope (1925-1997).    It must be remembered that these mutinies took place during the first round of war with post-Revolutionary France, while Napoleon Bonaparte was just one more ambitious general, and the English upper and middle classes were seriously concerned about home-grown Jacobins chopping off their heads. Both mutinies were causes of concern, at times amounting to hysteria, but for different reasons    James Dugan's \\"The Great Mutiny,\\" apparently long out of print, was a detailed (although not completely satisfactory) account of the \\"Great\\" (very large scale) Mutiny on the ships-of-the-line (three-deckers mounting 74 to 120 guns) at their bases at Spithead and the Nore. Although widely feared (or assumed) by the public and politicians to be an act of sympathy with the French Republic, the real trigger for this generally peaceful refusal to obey orders was simpler. It was fury at the decision to raise the pay of the army (which had known nothing but defeat), and keep that of ordinary seamen (who had been winning battles) where it had been for about a century.    The mutineers, who did have a list of reforms they wanted, insisted on their patriotism, claiming that they would gladly obey orders to fight the French, or any other [provide offensive epithet] foreigners. Xenophobia was, it seems, a remarkably effective antidote to apparent self-interest, despite the efforts of some more radical elements.    It was immediately recognized that the crews of frigates (cruisers, mounting 22 to 44 guns), except for those anchored under the guns of the three-deckers, did NOT join in the mutiny. These seamen had the hope of prize money from captured merchantmen (something available to the main fleet only in the rarest of circumstances), and seemed to have less interest in a comparatively negligible increase in official pay. Frigate captains, at least, must have felt relieved.    In this context, therefore, it was a particular shock when, later in the same year, the crew of the frigate \\"Hermione\\" suddenly rose up, killed officers and a hapless midshipman, and took the ship into a foreign  port -- not French and Republican, but Spanish and Catholic, which to some traditionalists must have seemed even worse.    This very different, and, in comparison, slightly paradoxical, rebellion at sea was the subject of Pope's 1963 volume, \\"The Black Ship.\\" The book has been reprinted at intervals over the years, a tribute to, among other things, its literary quality. (Also, I suspect to Pope's continuing production of naval fiction and non-fiction.)    \\"The Black Ship\\" explains how the combination of an incompetent and unfeeling captain and Irish nationalism  -- not the example of France -- produced a chain of events on \\"H.M.S. Hermione\\" which seemed to defy the conventional wisdom of the navy. Pope traces the career of Captain Pigot, the favored scion of a distinguished naval family, and makes it quite clear that hardly anyone else liked him.    Unlike Bligh, who was  a superb seaman, Pigot must have inspired both fear and contempt from those serving under him with his shiphandling skills. (Pope gives examples, including Pigot's efforts to blame everyone else.) Again unlike Bligh, Pigot was genuinely malicious, not merely a (catastrophically) poor judge of the feelings of others. Even so, he might have lived out a routine career, or managed to fall victim to the \\"hazards of the sea\\" which accounted for most of the Royal Navy's losses in the wars with the French Republic and Empire. (Quite possibly taking a ship and its crew with him....) Why something else happened is the burden of the first part of Pope'shistory of the miserable affair, and he provides a convincing explanation of just what went wrong.    The responses of His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Royal Navy make up the latter part of the story, which includes legal, political, and diplomatic issues. The recapture of the \\"Hermione\\" provides Pope with a chance to display a really good captain in action, in the same waters, with the same regulations and the same problems. The difference is remarkable, and that story, although secondary, is worth the price of the book by itself.    Some readers will probably know that bits and pieces of \\"The Black Ship\\" (and the events of the \\"Great Mutiny\\") show up in Pope's novels about Lord Ramage, written later in his career (eighteen volumes, 1965-1989), fairly lightly fictionalized. In addition, a renamed double of Captain Pigot makes an offstage appearance in one of Northcote Parkinson's novels of the Napoleonic Wars (\\"disguised\\" by a transfer to the Indian Ocean, and a very different resolution to the mutiny).	2004-01-19

This sacrifices convenience of layout (the Chinese text originally faced the translation, with, if necessary, only a few lines on each page) for economy. The index has likewise been revised in arrangement as well as page references. If there have been other modifications, corrections, or additions to the bibliographic references, I have missed them.<br /><br />There is one major omission: sixteen pages of photographs are missing (except for one, reproduced as a cover illustration). These are useful, but not essential. This was presumably in the interest of economy. Given that the previous edition is becoming more difficult to find, SUNY is to be praised for bringing the book back into print, even if this fact is somewhat obscured, and their version is slightly truncated.<br /><br />For those not familiar with it already, \\"Sun Bin\\" was long thought to be a bibliographic ghost, or even a lost forgery, a supposed long-missing counterpart to the existing \\"Art of War\\" of the elder Sun (Sun-tzu). It was one of the texts described in Han Dynasty bibliographies and histories, but not reliably reported as existing for well over a thousand years. The conclusions that it probably hadn't existed, or wasn't authentic if there was such a work, had to be abandoned when substantial fragments of it, and other texts, turned up in 1972, during the excavation of early Han Dynasty tombs.<br /><br />There have been several other translations into English during the last decade, but the co-authors of this volume make a distinguished combination of an eminent senior Sinologist, with a long career working with the problems of early literary texts (Lau) and a sophisticated modern interpreter of Chinese intellectual history (Ames). As a result, the reader is assured of first-rate technical scholarship, and clearly-expressed explanations.<br /><br />The emphases, not unexpectedly, are on textual and linguistic problems, and the place of the text in the development of Chinese military and political theory. Of the several other translations of the fragmentary, and in part enigmatic, text which are now available, Ralph D. Sawyer's version, as \\"Military Methods of The Art of War,\\" may be the most satisfactory alternative, or, better, companion volume.

The allusion in Miesel's title has obviously caused some confusion somewhere and Amazon may eventually straighten it out.    Although not nearly as much fun as Anderson's account of a medieval English lord's acquisition of an interstellar spaceship, \\"Against Time's Arrow\\" is a worthwhile review of Anderson's main themes and literary devices. Although the entertainment value of Anderson's fiction is always remembered, it is particularly good on the various moral dilemmas faced by characters. (Miesel who is also known for her critical studies of Gordon Dickson and Tolkien, and for several science fiction stories, may also be familiar to some readers as a Catholic journalist.)	2003-12-29

Compiled from original and other sources&#34; by Benjamin Thorpe, was first published in three volumes in 1851. This is a slightly revised text, with an Introduction by Jacqueline Simpson, issued in 2001 in the Myth, Legend And Folklore series of Wordsworth Editions, in association with The Folklore Society, and The Warburg Institute.<br /><br />The notable contents of the omnibus printing include: Introduction; Abbreviations and References; Further Reading in English; and an Index. The main divisions are -- Volume One: Northern Mythology and Illustrations. Volume Two: Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia; Volume Three: Popular Traditions and Superstitions of North Germany and the Netherlands.<br /><br />This was a major popularization by a  scholar distinguished in his own time (1782-1870). Among other labors on behalf of Germanic studies, he was an early editor and translator of &#34;Beowulf&#34;. His 1855 (second) edition of the work (original text and facing translation) was even reprinted in Barron's Educational Series in 1962, although probably because it was well out of copyright protection.  Unlike this compendium, it could hardly have enhanced his reputation for those trying to use it (what with separate numbers for half-lines, the assumption that skipped section numbers meant lost lines, and obsolete interpretations of the text) without realizing what it was.<br /><br />Simpson, who is well known for her own translations from Scandinavian texts, including Icelandic folktales, finds Volume One to be dated, although not inaccurate, but claims that the material in Volumes Two and Three is still valuable. Since I have found few works in English that are so comprehensive for the folklore of these areas, I would agree.<br /><br />Volume One is still of some value, not as a source on Norse mythology, but for students of literature trying to verify what information would have been availablein English in the later nineteenth-century. However, a discrete note with the publishing data reveals: &#34;Where there is an anachronistic use of language or punctuation likely to be misunderstood by the general reader, some small changes have been made to the original text of this book.&#34; Those who need precise accuracy in citations, may, therefore, need to specify this edition, or find a library with an original edition to compare. [See now the 2017 addendum for an alternative source.]<br /><br />An even more comprehensive work from the same period is Jakob Grimm's &#34;Deutsche Mythologie&#34; (second edition, 1844) translated in the 1880s as &#34;Teutonic Mythology&#34; (by Jacob Grimm); I have reviewed the recent hardcover reprinting by Dover -- their 1966 paperback edition is long out of print -- and briefly compared the two. Thorpe's whole plan was less ambitious, so there are fewer places where he could go wrong; but some of the excitement of discovery is lost.<br /><br />[Addendum, August 31, 2017: It has been a long time since I reviewed this work. Looking at it for the first time in some years, I note first of all that used copies of the paperback edition are sometimes available. However, for those willing to read the unrevised text in PDF format, the three volumes of the original edition are available (free) from the Internet Archive (archive.org). So are the four volumes of Grimm's &#34;Teutonic Mythology: and, for that matter, so is Rydberg's less distinguished, but more literary, work on Norse Mythology, also translated (from the Swedish) under the confusing title of &#34;Teutonic Mythology.&#34; (Actually, these are offered in several formats, but, given conversion problems into plain text or Kindle versions, for example, only the PDF versions can be considered reliable.)]	2003-12-21

It is a translation, somewhat revised by the author, of \\"Lexikon der germanischen Mythologie,\\" originally published in 1984. Angela Hall's translation reads well, although the German sentence structure and vocabulary show through from time to time. (Works of literature \\"come into being.\\") There also some minor annoyances: Why use an unusual word like \\"descendancy\\" (as in \\"belief in the divine descendancy of the Germanic kings\\"), when \\"descent\\" is available?    The perspective throughout is continental and German, rather than, like most of the works currently available in English, Scandinavian or Anglo-American. Heroic legends are considered only where they unquestionably overlap with stories of the gods, or appear to preserve descriptions of rituals and beliefs. Scandinavian words and names are generally given in their original spelling, including special letters and accents, either as the main heading, or at least as an alternative to a familiar Anglicized spelling. (Some casual readers may find this annoying, but it is extremely useful.) Latin sources include not only the inevitable Caesar, Tacitus, and Pliny, but inscriptions with Germanic, or possibly Germanic, names, notably including dedications to the \\"Matronae,\\" on which the readily available literature in English is rather small.    Three quarters of fairly serious study of Old English at UCLA, plus a lot of unsystematic reading, does not give me the background to pass an independent judgment on the etymologies, but the German edition seems to have been well-received by the professional community. The main secondary sources Simek cites are highly reputable. In the few instances in which I have studied the literature about a name or word, Simek's views are entirely reasonable (even if I don't always agree with the side he is on.) I expect to use Simek as a basic reference on these matters for years to come, along with two other recent reference volumes, Lindow's \\"Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs\\" and Orchard's \\"Dictionary of Norse Myth & Legend.\\"    The cumulative bibliography is impressive, and seems well-chosen; I expect to make considerable use of it. Given its length, there are only a few unexpected omissions. The nineteenth-century Stallybrass translation of Jakob Grimm's pioneering \\"Deutsche mythologie\\" (as \\"Teutonic Mythology\\"), long available from Dover Publications in paperbafck [and since re-issued by them is hardcover], is missing. One might presume that the German original is listed for its historical interest only, but in fact it is cited, by page numbers, as a basic reference in some articles. Adding or substituting the English version would have been a convenience; although added work for the industrious translator. Among recent titles, the English translation of P.V. Glob's \\"The Mound People\\" is included, but not that of his better-known account of Iron Age bodies preserved in peat, \\"The Bog People\\" -- it *is* obsolete, but so is the Danish original! Although there are probably other gaps, given the number of titles involved, and the variety of languages they represent, these are minor issues.    So far, overwhelmingly to the good.    Unfortunately, coverage of narrative sources, particularly those from outside of Scandinavia, is oddly spotty. Some of it is quite good, but some is not. For example, the Venerable Bede (page 33) does indeed give the earliest extant (but not necessarily the earliest) version of the story of Hengest and Horsa, and the arrival of the Germanic tribes in Britain. But he has nothing to say of Scyld Scefing, who appears as such only in \\"Beowulf.\\" Simek elsewhere gives the impression that Beowulf the Dane, son of Scyld, is the hero of the epic, instead of Beowulf the Geat. (It is generally, although not universally, accepted that the Danish Beowulf is a scribal error for Beow[a], son of Sceaf in other texts.)     Most of the factual errors I have spotted are easily corrected by consulting the (usually well-known) original sources, or just another reference book, but a lot of people probably won't bother, so their presence is disturbing. If they are carried over from the German edition, they should have been caught and corrected by the time the author revised the book for the present translation.    There are also some more purely typographical errors, such as \\"Nennius\\" for Ennius, an early Latin poet (page 75). (A Nennius is the author, according to some manuscripts, of a \\"British History\\" in which Hengest and Horsa appear, along with Vortigern and a version of Merlin ... and perhaps should have rated an entry.)    An immediately attractive feature of the book is the information on the modern \\"reception\\" of the character or story -- poems, plays, operas, art, etc. However, I hope that the information on German works is more accurate than that on English and French literature. For example, Simek correctly reports, as has long been recognized, that the Germanic dwarf Alberich entered French literature as Auberon (later Oberon), an undersized Fairy King in the story of \\"Huon of Bordeaux\\" -- but that is a Carolingian, not an Arthurian, romance (page 6). Elsewhere, \\"Huon de Bordeaux\\" is certainly *not* the author of an Elizabethan chapbook about Oberon  (page 239)! The latter entry also confounds the characters of Shakespeare's \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and Spenser's \\"The Faerie Queene.\\" Of less literary moment, on page 323, \\"the cartoon series *Der maechtige Thor*\\" is probably the (unrecognized by the translator?) Marvel comic book \\"The Mighty Thor.\\" Two novels are cited as \\"Literature\\" under \\"Werwolves\\" -- from other information, the titles of both appear to be metaphorical, and one (in German!) should read \\"Wehrwolf\\" not \\"Werwolf.\\" (The science fiction andfantasy fan in me wants to replace them with James Blish's \\"There Shall Be No Darkness\\" and Jack Williamson's  \\"Darker Than You Think,\\" among other titles.)    In conclusion, this is a worthwhile work, which seems trustworthy in its area of main focus, and somewhat erratic when covering side issues, particularly modern literary works.	2003-12-12

West's translation of Hesiod's \\"Theogony\\" and \\"Works and Days\\" for the Oxford World's Classics actually refer to Dorothea Wender's verse translation of the same works, plus a charming version of the collection of lyrics attributed to Theognis, published in the Penguin Classics. That is a worthwhile version -- although the joining of the peasant-oriented Boeotian Hesiod to the mainly aristocratic, and partly Athenian, \\"Theognis\\" corpus is a little odd.    West's version of the two main Hesiodic poems is, however, in prose, and offers the latest in textual and historical scholarship -- although this is not very obviously on display. West, who has edited much (perhaps by now all) of the \\"Hesiodic\\" corpus, with substantial technical commentaries (along with a good deal of Homer and the \\"Homeric Hymns\\"), offers here his best reading of the two long poems which seem most firmly attributed Hesiod. (Although some, including Wender, would prefer two poets, in addition to the problem of interpolations).    West's commentary, although useful, is surprisingly sparse, given what he could have offered; a lot of detailed argument has been converted into the translation itself.    \\"Theogony,\\" for those not familiar with the work even by reputation, is the story of the origins and struggles of the gods of Classical Greece. Although the meter and basic style are those of the Homeric epics, and the gods are mainly the same, many details are different (Zeus is a younger son, not the eldest, for example), and the struggles between various generations are the foreground story, not a long-concluded background to the reign of Zeus. We meet Heaven, and his sons and daughters, culminating in the rebellion of the Titans, then the Olympians, who wage war against their father and his fellow-Titans, and so on. It is an extremely violent story, full of abusive parents, mutilations inflicted by rebellious offspring, divine cannibalism, and a whole succession of other behaviors the Greeks themselves considered repellent. The philosophers had real problems with this work -- one can understand from it why Plato wanted to ban poets from the ideal state.    Interspersed through the action are a number of catalogues of nature-deities, which are variously regarded by critics as interpolations or key structural elements. Many readers simply find them boring; it helps if you are using a translation which interprets the Greek names, which are usually charmingly appropriate for the natural element being personified.    \\"Works and Days\\" contains several important mythological passages, expanding and altering \\"Theogony,\\" but is in the main a sort of sermon on how to be prosperous and righteous. It is packed with details of daily life, which readers will find either fascinating or tedious. and are sometimes rather opaque. West does a good job in making  readable this combination of a sort of pagan equivalent of an Old Testament prophet with an Iron Age Farmer's Almanac, and his notes do help with some of the knottier passages. (Note that there is one recent translation-with-commentary of the \\"Works\\" which is dedicated almost entirely to making detailed agricultural and ethnographic sense of it; West clearly offers a more literary approach.)    The latter part of the twentieth century has seen a number of translations of the main Hesiodic poems, by Apostolos N. Athanassakis, R.M. Frazer, Richmond Lattimore, and, as noted above, Dorothea Wender (Penguin Classics), to join the old Evelyn-White bilingual edition for the Loeb Classical Library edition, with numerous attributed fragments. (A new Loeb edition has announced). There are also translations of single poems, by Norman O. Brown and by Richard S. Caldwell (both of the \\"Theogony\\") and Tandy and Neale (\\"Works and Days\\"). West offers a substantial alternative to the others, based on an exceptionally close knowledge of the textual problems.	2003-12-03

It is indeed not formal English verse, but after decades of use I still find his translation not only readable but exceptionally attractive, and at least poetic, and not just by comparison to the old Evelyn-White translation.]<br /><br />The poems are described as Homer's in the manuscript tradition, in which they are offered together with hymns by historical poets, but also some attributed to the mythical Orpheus. They are in the dactylic hexameter line of the Homeric epics, which in some of them is employed as a lyric meter -- a somewhat astonishing idea to those who know the \\"Iliad\\" and the \\"Odyssey.\\" Athanassakis does a wonderful job of producing consistently attractive English versions, while attempting to adhere closely to the original. (I have no claims to real scholarship in this, but I once took the trouble to work through passages against the corresponding lines in a Greek text, with the help of the Liddel-&-Scott \\"Lexicon\\" and several grammars.)<br /><br />After a long period of neglect on the part of translators into English, this group of poems has been translated in both verse and prose a number of times in recent decades. This volume first appeared at about the same time as translations by the poet Charles Boer (extremely \\"modern\\") and by Thelma Sargent in the Norton Library (to mention those still in print). These lacked the helpful apparatus (although Sargent could probably have provided something similar). The later Shelmerdine translation, in the Focus Classical Library series, is very extensively annotated, but is in part aimed at readers completely unfamiliar with Greek myth and literature in part at those more interested in narrative than ancient verse-forms. (In other words, a good textbook in a world in which the \\"classics\\" have dropped out of pre-collegiate courses.) Among the crop of *very* recent translations, by Cashford (Penguin Classics, with notes by Richardson), by Crudden (Oxford World's Classics), and (in a Loeb Classical Library bilingual edition) by M.L. West) [and now (2004) Diane Rayor], the work of Athanassakis seems to me to retain its place as both attractive and useful. Although Crudden, in particular, shows the benefit of another quarter-century of scholarship, his annotations often address other issues, and his notes on some of the hymns range from slim to nothing at all.<br /><br />How important are the notes? To a casual reader, they are of interest only if they help to make sense of a passage at hand. Some readers, however, will be using the book as a primary source for Greek myth and religion. Guesses and compromises obvious to a classicist, or even an amateur like me, may look like solid facts to the uninformed.<br /><br />An example of the care Athanassakis takes with such issues is his explanation of a much-debated passage in the \\"Hymn to Demeter.\\" It is usually understood to explain winter as the portion of the year Persephone must remain in the Underworld. (If you don't know the story, sorry --  look it up, you may enjoy it). Unfortunately, explicit statements of this interpretation in Greek texts are late. Some scholars, such as the very distinguished authority on Greek religion, M.P. Nilsson, have argued for the barren Mediterranean summer instead. The \\"Hymn\\" should settle the matter, and Athanassakis, like most translators, offers a version in which it *is* winter --  but explicitly notes (as Cashford/Richardson, for example, do not) that the whole section is in such poor condition in the only extant manuscript that this is merely a plausible reconstruction. Important to know, if you want to build on argument on what looks like a solid fact!ichardson, for example, do not) that the whole section is in such poor condition in the only extant manuscript that this is merely a plausible reconstruction.

Evans-Wentz's \\"Oxford Tibetan Series,\\" it suffers from a dependence on Tibetan translators working at time when few clear guidelines for translating technical terms had been developed, and from Evans-Wentz's own lack of familiarity with Mahayana Buddhism and its various schools. (Which apparently has not prevented it from achieving its own canonical status with some readers; a process not unknown in the history of translations, from the Christian adoption of the Septuagint in place of its Hebrew original, to some Chinese -- and Tibetan -- renderings of Buddhist Sanskrit  texts.)    As Lopez points out in his introduction to this new edition (part of an end-of-the-century reissue of the series, in which the publisher formally acknowledges over a half-century of additional scholarship), Theosophy and Hinduism are the real points of departure. There is a commentary to the translation offered by C.G. Jung, which is of great importance to students -- but of Jung, not of Tibetan Buddhism. The historical significance, and sometimes impressive literary quality, of the translation series is enduring; its value as a set of primary sources is not.    However, a large section of the book is given over to an (abridged) translation of one of the traditional biographies of the *Lotus-Born Guru*, the \\"Apostle to the Tibetans.\\" In western terms, it is a mix of popular hagiography (like \\"The Golden Legend\\"), heroic romance, and supernatural thriller. So far as I have been able to determine, it is the only English-language version of this particular text (there are other Tibetan treatments of the subject, a number of which have been translated), and it makes fascinating reading, simply as a piece of story-telling.    The translation of the story has extensive, and sometimes obsolete, annotations which attempt to tie down the places and times mentioned, but which also recognize that portions, at least, are intended to be symbolic or allegorical (which does not mean that the original audience would not have regarded them as literally true, as well). Padma-Sambhava, besides introducing advanced forms of Buddhist Yoga, is supposed to have written, and concealed for future generations, a number of important texts, including, besides the one translated as \\"The Great Liberation,\\" the so-called \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" (Evans-Wentz's catchy, but potentially misleading, title). He also appears as a major character in some versions of the Tibetan \\"Gesar\\" epic.    The presence of this fascinating piece of Tibetan literature may account for the interesting fact that Snow Lion, the publisher of the competing \\"Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness,\\" offers this book in its catalogue as well (as of Summer 2003).     Those who find this portion of the book interesting will probably also enjoy the traditional \\"biography\\" of a Tibetan holy man, in \\"Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa,\\" another volume edited by Evans-Wentz. (It is a companion volume in the Oxford Tibetan series). It presents itself as its hero's own account of his progression from black magician (to avenge his family) to Enlightenment. (There are several editions of the translation available; the 1999 Oxford paperback reprinting, uniform with the present volume, including a new introduction, should be in print at this writing.)	2003-11-26
US	30081986	ROGCZFB635YGK	0140437827	46811656	Homeric Hymns (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	48	49	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Not Your Ordinary Hymnal	This review concerns the Penguin Classics volume of \\"The Homeric Hymns,\\" translated by Jules Cashford, with an Introduction and Notes by Nicholas Richardson -- just in case this is appearing with another translation, as was the case with two earlier reviews originally posted here, and since removed (at least one of which was of the version translated and annotated by Susan C. Shelmerdine, for the Focus Classical Library).    The Homeric Hymns themselves are a miscellaneous collection of 33 poems, differing in terms of age and likely function; what they have in common are the Greek gods who are their subject, and the epic hexameter. They are assigned to Homer in a manuscript tradition which includes the supposed works of the mythical poet Orpheus, which for starters does not inspire confidence in the attribution, along with literary hymns by the historical figures Callimachus and Proclus. The \\"Homeric\\" songs range from the reverential (the Hymn to Demeter) to the humorous (the first Hymn to Hermes) in tone, and the contents are variously lyric and narrative. The long hymns at the opening of the collection are of considerable importance to our knowledge of Greek myth and religion, but the following shorter hymns have a value of their own. The description as \\"hymns\\" is in some cases problematic (although it has attracted listings of Christian hymnals to some of the Amazon sites for other translations!). At least some of the shorter works seem to have been intended as introductory invocations to the gods at public performances of other works, including the Homeric epics. In these cases, despite their religious nature, I agree with the Classicists who argue that \\"proem\\" is probably the better term.    For some reason, the long-neglected collection has come in for a lot of attention from translators in Britain and America during the last quarter-century or so. Earlier translations, with the exception of Evelyn-White's bilingual volume in the Loeb Classical Library (itselfvery recently replaced by a new edition by M.L. West) had long since dropped out of print. Now the reader faces an abundance of riches, most with something different to offer. There is an interesting, rather aggressively modern, translation by Boer (1970; second edition, restoring missing text, preferred), and more conventional ones, with various sorts of commentaries, by Athanassakis (1976; second edition, 2004, not seen), Crudden (2001; Oxford World's Classics, 2002), Sargent (1973; very readable, but no commmentary), Shelmerdine (1995), and West (2003; with Greek text), with another, by Diane Rayor, published in 2004. [As of August 2004, I have reviewed the 1976 Athanassakis, West, and Rayor translations.] There have also been a number of treatments of single hymns, including one by Richardson.    The Cashford translation is in verse, but frequently breaks up the long hexameter lines into shorter, more \\"lyrical\\" English phrases; marginal numbers indicate five-line intervals in the underlying Greek text. This gives an initial impression of a very free translation, but spot-checking against West's recent Loeb edition shows an admirable fidelity to details of the Greek, even distinguishing epithets others consider synonyms. Boer uses a similar approach to the verse forms, but Cashford's English is more dignified, and generally suited to a very formal type of composition, which is what we seem to be dealing with, after all.    The Richardson annotations (pages 149 to 174) are useful, and usually to the point; they compare well with the different approaches taken by Athanassakis and Crudden, and all three have something to offer.    A glossary/index, like that offered by Crudden, would probably be very welcome to those readers unfamiliar with Greek myth and literature, if they happen to try this book. (Also to those who just want to locate something quickly!) Of course, if it is used as a textbook it will probably accompany one off the many available introductions toGreek mythology. (If not, Shelmerdine's almost chokingly annotated translation is out there, too.)     This is a welcome addition to the Penguin catalogue, and this reader hopes that it stays there for a good long time.    [Note: an interesting, very detailed, review of this translation by a professional classicist, Stephen Evans, has since become available on-line (posted in early 2004), through the \\"Bryn Mawr Classical Review,\\" and can be located by the author (Cashford) or the reviewer in the site Archive.]	2003-11-25

Beyer uses as his case study the wide-spread devotion to Tara (the Sanskrit form; in Tibetan, Dolma), the (paradoxically) female Bodhisattva who is regarded as one of the special patrons of Tibet. Basic and advanced forms of ritual and meditation are described, and there are attractive line drawings of many of the implements (as well as some not-so-clear, but interesting, black-and-white photographs).<br /><br />There is an enormous amount of detail about elementary and advanced ritual activities, from those practices known to most lay-people to relatively less-known and complex meditation techniques, very much including the use of permanent objects and material and symbolic offerings. Of course, in a world-view in which the material world is itself an illusion, the differences between the tangible and the symbolic tend to fade away.<br /><br />Beyer's exposition makes clear that the reported association with magic of Vajrayana Buddhism in particular, and the larger categories of Tantric Buddhism and Hinduism in general, is not a complete misrepresentation, but the natural result of a world-view in which magic is a real possibility. In Tibet, at least, the preferred solution has been to try to make sure that those who develop supernatural powers are also indoctrinated with strong ethical teachings; in other words, the specialists in religion.<br /><br />This book is not, as a whole, easy reading, although the introductory chapters should present few obstacles. Beyer is enormously respectful of the religion and those who practice it, but his approach is analytical and, to some extent, critical / historical. Those interested mainly in devotional readings, including many of the texts Beyer cites or excerpts, might try Martin Willson's \\"In Praise of Tara: Songs to the Saviouress: Source Texts from India and Tibet on Buddhism's Great Goddess,\\" which will also be of great interest to those who appreciate Beyer's handling of the material.	2003-11-23

First-hand knowledge of at least some of the texts, and of modern scholarship, is essential if one is to go beyond the obvious. So is recognition that neither is monolithic. Barbara Holdrege's monograph on the concepts of revelation in the two ancient traditions is an outstanding example of how to do it right. We not only learn that both cultural traditions have a sacred revelation (officially oral, not scriptural, for India), and a long history of interpreting it, but how they understood the source and nature of the revelation, over a long period of time. Styles and theories of interpretation are related to these concepts.<br /><br />The result is a sometimes overwhelming mass of detail, arranged thematically and chronologically, setting forth views held in each of the two religions (or religious civilizations, to adapt Mordecai Kaplan's characterization of Judaism). These two sets of expositions are rewarding in themselves, and Holdrege brilliantly combines exposition of the theme with examples of different literary modes and styles of interpretation in use at various times. Particularly interesting is the Indian conception of the Vedas as a Revelation without a Revealer, a Truth heard and spoken that is prior to the Divine, and made known to the Gods, which reverses many western assumptions, from Homer to Islam.<br /><br />With the issues and approaches made clear, and some idea of chronological development (clearer on the Jewish than the Indian side), Holdrege proceeds with the process of comparison, allowing a high level of detail and sophistication in her analysis. In both cases, the material examined is mainly from the \\"official\\" cultures - Brahminic and Rabbinic - because that is where the evidence is to be found.<br /><br />The reader already familiar with either of the two bodies of literature will find that a fair amount of space is devoted to relatively basic exposition, but very few readers are likely to be so well acquainted with both that all of these pages can be skipped safely. I have read fairly widely in both fields (although much more and much longer on the Jewish side), on a very nonprofessional level, and was surprised at how much useful information Holdrege provided -- and also at how much the comparative enterprise transformed the emphases in her presentations. Those familiar only with Christian concepts of Scripture and hermeneutics will probably need the full explanations of classical teachings and interpretive traditions, Jewish as well as Indian, which Holdrege offers.<br /><br />In a too-brief conclusion (which could be the kernel of another book, or two), Holdrege compares Christianity, Islam and Buddhism to the Rabbinic and Brahmanic traditions -- or, more properly, selected aspects of various Christianities, Islams, and Buddhisms. This section describes how Buddhism in India differed with the Vedic traditions (rejection of the Vedic canon being the very definition of heresy), describing the Theravadin (Pali Canon) emphasis on understanding the Buddha's discourse, picking up occasional comparisons elsewhere in the volume.  (Later developments in Buddhism, such as the recitation of mantras seem to show trends in the same direction of privileging sound over comprehension, and one wonders if latent Indian themes were manifesting themselves in a Buddhist guise.)<br /><br />The density of the presentation, as well as the length of the book, mean that it is not for the casual reader. For those with a serious interest in either tradition, as well as both, it is likely to be very rewarding.	2003-11-16
US	30081986	R329T2MRWJY1P7	0292783760	714737121	Morphology of the Folktale (Publications of the American Folklore Society)	Books	5	49	51	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Brilliant, But Hard Going	This is an attempt to work out the underlying structural patterns (types of characters, what they do, how they are ordered) of Russian folktales, based on classic collections made in the nineteenth-century. If you are fortunate enough to have read a large collection of such stories -- preferably in translation, not \\"retold by ...\\" -- you will soon see the point of Propp's argument. Other European, and some non-European, traditions provide an almost equally good starting point, although the examples often are not so close as to be immediately convincing. Ideally, \\"Morphology of the Folktale\\" would be bound with at least a selection of the Russian folktales Propp analyzes, but this does not seem likely to happen.      Taken by itself, however, Propp's exploration is going to seem both dry and confusing. Try to imagine a book about the five-act structure of Shakespeare's tragedies being read by someone who had never seen or read a play before, and you may understand the problem.     Although Propp's exposition sometimes seems labored, he presents a convincing case that at least some oral prose narratives are built up of a stock of situations and events which can be slightly reordered, multiplied, and otherwise complicated, but amount to a \\"language\\" (a vocabulary, grammar, and syntax) of story-telling. This puts a new light on the problem of the distribution of folktales, and how they develop variants, two of the great issues of folklore studies in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.     Despite its origins in a single body of oral literature, Propp's methods have been applied to other literature with known or suspected oral roots, sometimes with slightly contradictory results. I know of at least two different Proppian analyses of \\"Beowulf,\\" for example. This is due at least in part to Propp's attempt to introduce fine divisions between similar plot elements, which, again, seem to work better with his source material than with other groups of stories. (And \\"Beowulf\\" has long been recognized to include elements later found in European fairy tales, so the possibility of applying Propp's structures was more intriguing than revolutionary.)    In \\"Feud in the Icelandic Saga\\" (1983), Jesse Byock reviewed efforts to apply Propp's methods to the Sagas of the Icelanders, another body of prose literature supposed to be grounded in oral techniques. He argued that a different approach is needed to their formally realistic stories about personalities, and the functioning of society; which does not diminish the validity of Propp's approach to the wonder-tale.	2003-11-10
US	30081986	R24V8DVIXOAOV4	0304363855	26205294	Cassell's Dictionary of Norse Myth & Legend (Cassell Reference)	Books	5	29	29	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Compact Edition	I have been reading serious books about Norse mythology since the mid-1960s (I don't remember when I first encountered versions for children), and have studied the primary sources in translation, and, to a very limited (and amateurish) extent, in the original languages. This is exactly the sort of reference book / handbook I used to dream about, and which seemed to be available only as watered-down introductions for schoolchildren, or, if reasonably scholarly, in German. A recent example of the latter, by Rudolf Simek, has been translated by Angela Hall, as \\"Dictionary of Northern Mythology\\" (1993). The end of the twentieth century, has, in fact, seen several works of this sort, solidly based in scholarship, yet simple enough for those unfamiliar with the subject to enjoy. To my great pleasure, they are even being written in English.     This example is a re-set, mass-market edition of the 1997 \\"Cassell Dictionary...,\\" which was published in both hardcover and trade paperback editions. The textual contents appear to be identical (I do not have a copy at hand to compare, so I am relying on memory), although, given the changes, it will be useful in the future to give references to Orchard by head-words, rather than page numbers. The original illustrations have been omitted; against this loss, the mass-market edition is in print.     The contents are extremely impressive. All of the major, and almost all of the minor, figures of Norse myth and legend from Scandinavian sources, together with other Germanic materials, and other relevant texts and archeological and other sources are catalogued and concisely described or defined. (The coverage of heroic legend is limited to the major figures, particularly those attested outside Scandinavia. Unfortunately, some of the more reliable and interesting correspondences to Migration-Age history, such as the names of the Niflung / Burgundian royal family, are slighted.)     There are cross-references to related articles - none, sofar as I have noticed, leading in circles (as I have seen in too many reference works). Major critical issues are covered briefly and clearly, and with impressive objectivity (compare the discreet entry on \\"Beowulf,\\" with due regard for the scholarly consensus, to the author's own views in his own 1995 book on the subject, \\"Pride and Prodigies...\\").     The difficult problem of transcribing Norse and Anglo-Saxon names, with their unfamiliar characters, has been solved by a few simple rules, clearly explained; exceptions are made for some very familiar forms, like Odin and Thor, where consistency would have called for accent marks. This will annoy purists, and perhaps those who have studied the relevant languages a little, but is far less intimidating to the uninitiated.     The articles are supplied with bibliographic references, in cryptic-looking letter-number combinations which direct the reader to numbered items in four separate bibliographies (references, primary sources, sources in translation, and studies). With something like 800 titles to deal with, this saves space, and avoids the problem of keeping track of whether or not an item appears in one or more places, and in full or short form. Although it looks confusing, I have found that the alphanumeric system makes it relatively easy to check the references. There is also an index of medieval passages and authors cited in the text.     An attractive feature is a set of appendices cataloguing such things as the names and titles of Odin, the names of Dwarfs, of Giants, and of \\"Troll-wives, Giantesses and Valkyries\\" (the last set showing so much overlap and confusion that grouping them together was probably the most practical solution). As in the articles, names are supplied with translations, if the meaning is reasonably clear.     Among recent works actually written in English, the most nearly comparable is John Lindow's \\"Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs.\\" It differs in offering fewer, but longer, articles, with much more extended discussions of critical issues, literary problems, and rival interpretations. It omits some of the items of in the \\"Dictionary,\\" but also covers some topics which Orchard only mentions. Lindow's bibliography seems much less comprehensive, but he includes essays on both the primary sources and the secondary literature (including how to evaluate on-line offerings). I have both, and would not give up either, but Orchard clearly offers the better bargain to a novice looking for a single reference source, covering more material, with a simpler-looking approach to each item.	2003-10-26
US	30081986	R6HW53TPCS8YM	0691019584	306838453	A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy	Books	5	29	40	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: A Classic Anthology	Originally published in 1957, and reissued in paperback in the 1960s, this is basically a textbook (or supplementary reading source) for the serious study of the philosophical schools of India -- very much including the religious traditions.      Radhakrishnan and Moore assembled and edited an impressive body of material, most of it in selections, with useful introductions and helpful notes. It begins with philosophical passages in early Sanskrit religious texts, and proceeds through their orthodox interpreters, through heterodox approaches (materialist, Jaina, and Buddhist), and the medieval synthesizers, and concludes with a chapter each on two modern Indian philosophers, Sri Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan himself.      Although the work is careful and solid, it represents a half-century-old point of view, and especially bibliographically is in places quite out of date. So far as I am aware, however, there is no recent, but equally comprehensive and well-documented collection, available in English (specific topics are another matter). The translations are in places not only old but unappealing. It can be misleading, and at the very least it does not deal with fifty-odd years of controversy over the absolute and relative datings of various key texts. With this in mind, however, it is certainly worth reading.      This should be the whole content of my review; the remainder, is I fear, currently necessary, for reasons external to the book in question.      The age of the book has left it open to attacks which are less reasonable, from certain Indian nationalists and their more naive supporters, including reviewers here. The editors took for granted the conventional view (since the later nineteenth century) that the recorded history of Indian thought begins with the ancient literature in Sanskrit, itself a very early example of the Indo-European languages (see below). Anything earlier is either irretrievably lost, or inextricably interwoven with the Sanskrit and Prakrit(medieval vernacular) heritage, including that in the Dravidian languages of south Asia, notably Tamil.      This conflicts with traditional Hindu (and Jaina and Buddhist) views about the eternal nature of Indian civilization, and from a religious point of view is simply wrong; but Indian concepts of time are one of the subjects covered in this book (if not entirely adequately), and have little to do with Western empirical studies. (A Christian Fundamentalist or ultra-Orthodox Jew would have equivalent, if opposite, objections.)      In the absence of extended texts (instead of clusters of undeciphered glyphs) from the Indus Valley civilization, this is still the basic working assumption, despite attempts to recognize Shiva, for example, in ancient art. The dates are, within limits, open to debate, and the relationship of the arrival of the &quot;Aryas&quot; to the fall of the Indus Valley civilization is no longer taken as obvious. Still, the Sanskrit language is regarded as having entered India with invading tribes from the north, which occupied the inviting plains of northern India (including modern Pakistan). Their (&quot;Vedic&quot;) language and culture, if not the tribes themselves, very slowly spread over the northern part of the subcontinent, and eventually beyond. (This has historical parallels, including the Persians, Alexander's Macedonians, and a variety of later, more permanent, invaders, most recently Muslims from Central Asia.) The ancient oral literature of the &quot;Aryas&quot; (Noble Ones), encapsulated in the Vedas and Brahmanas, is the foundation of later developments, including the Upanishads, the Epics, and the Puranas.      Some reviewers, perhaps accepting well-publicized recent &quot;discoveries&quot; (of an often dubious nature), seem to find this objectionable. They are either implicitly denying the well-known relationship of Sanskrit to Old Persian, and of both to Greek, Latin, and the Slavic, Baltic, Celtic, Germanic (and several other) languages, or they are arguing that the whole Indo-European (or, especially for German scholars, &quot;Indo-Germanic&quot;) language group originated in India.      This latter approach was a view entertained in the nineteenth-century infancy of comparative linguistics; it has had a revival in India, where it has an understandable appeal. (Starting their history with an unrecorded invasion is an annoying idea -- although it leaves India in the same &quot;humiliating&quot; position as most of Europe.) Radhakrishnan and Moore were certainly familiar with some earlier versions of this position (including a variant which expressed open sympathy with the &quot;Aryans&quot; of Nazi Germany), and ignored them.      The &quot;out of India&quot; choice requires accepting that the ancient Indo-European speakers (in modern thought, a linguistic, not a genetic, grouping), instead of spreading throughout Eurasia in unrelated migrations and episodes of cultural influence, marched north from India, over the Himalayas, across some of the world's most rugged terrain, and spread out, presumably conquering as they went, imposing their language on the subjugated peoples, who learned to speak it as best they could.      This is possible to imagine, if militarily (and otherwise) highly unlikely. It presents India as the original colonial super-power, however. This view is actually endorsed, if not widely publicized in the West, by a variety of nationalist groups in India, whose &quot;anti-imperialism&quot; is apparently limited to recent, and European or Muslim, empires.      Those who want to present India in a positive light should perhaps complain less about what is, on the whole an admiring look at the sub-continents' more peaceful (if occasionally startlingly pragmatic / Machiavellian) contributions to history, in volumes like the present one. Radhakrishnan and Moore made a serious effort to explain the intellectual heritage of India. I wish I didn't feel it was necessary to defend them.	2003-10-24
US	30081986	R155C46RB4MLM9	0892816031	446820605	The Philosophy of Classical Yoga	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Not for Beginners	Those familiar with some of Georg Feuerstein's popular books, such as &#34;Yoga for Dummies&#34; may mistake this very short book for something similar, but with more emphasis on theory and less on practice. Despite being brief and -- considering the subject -- clearly written, it would probably be unreadably difficult for someone not already somewhat familiar with at least the names and major tenets of the major philosophical schools of the Hindu tradition, and their various relations (or supposed relations) to Yoga. Despite its brevity (or maybe because of it), this is the sort of book one needs to prepare to read. (Feuerstein's own description on the Amazon site is &#34;for Advanced Students,&#34; and he suggests his &#34;Encyclopedia of Yoga&#34; -- there are also several excellent general works on Indian philosophy, including Zimmer's old &#34;Philosophies of India,&#34; which I found helpful.)  Feuerstein attempts nothing less than a re-visioning of the place of the Yoga-sutras (attributed to Patanjali) within the development of Indian philosophies (including Buddhism). The book is in some ways a companion to his own &#34;The Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali: A New Translation and Commentary,&#34; and picks up many of the issues argued there in relation to the received text and its classic interpretations.  Feuerstein also surveys relevant positions taken by modern scholars. His phrasing in these discussions is sometimes, to my way of thinking, a bit unfair (although engagingly lively).  For example, Mircea Eliade, whose &#34;Yoga: Immortality and Freedom&#34; is probably still the most widely accepted academic work in the field, is congratulated for disagreeing with his Indian mentors, and blamed for agreeing with them, strictly according to Feuerstein's views on the matter at hand. This is helpful insofar as it makes some of the issues stand out clearly, but I find that it grates a little.	2003-10-24
US	30081986	RPQUYUAWEPXT6	0198261772	103421618	The Apocryphal Old Testament	Books	5	36	38	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Explaining the Title and Contents	The title of this book is a little confusing; it can be taken to refer to the wrong set of books. In simplified form, the situation is this. When St. Jerome was preparing a new Latin version of Christian Scriptures (eventually known as the Vulgate), he undertook to work directly from the Hebrew and Aramaic texts of the &#34;Old Testament,&#34; instead of from Greek translations (the source of the Old Latin version he was replacing). He discovered that a considerable number of books could be found only in Greek, and noted that the presumed originals were &#34;hidden writings,&#34; or *apocrypha*. These included First and Second Maccabees, Ecclesiasticus (or Jesus Sirachides, or Ben Sira), The Wisdom of Solomon, and several other works, including parts of Daniel. They were retained by the Latin Church as part of the official canon of Scripture, as they were by the Eastern Orthodox Churches, for whom the Greek text was authoritative.  The inspired status of these books was challenged during the Reformation, and many Protestants began calling them &#34;apocryphal&#34;, in the modern sense of unreliable, not authoritative. In the King James Version, they were translated as an afterthought, and variously sandwiched between the Old and New Testaments, appended to the New Testament, or omitted. The Catholic Church maintained the traditional Western canon, describing the disputed books and portions of books as Deuterocanonical (a second canon). As a whole, they clearly belong to the Hellenistic period, and those which in fact had Hebrew or Aramaic originals were withdrawn from public use by Jewish authorities as unacceptable rivals to their canon of Scripture. (Ben Sira is quoted in Rabbinic literature, and was still being copied by Jews in the Middle Ages, so the process was slow in some cases.)  This decision left the now questionable term &#34;Apocrypha&#34; available for Catholic scholars in particular to use to refer to books which never made it into the established canons of the Greek and Latin Churches, but were sometimes cited by early Christian writers as canonical Scripture. There are some works whose authority was always debated in and between the Latin and Greek Churches, such as Third and Fourth (or First and Second) Esdras, and Third and Fourth Maccabees. The category also includes various &#34;Books of Enoch,&#34; Jubilees (a retelling of Genesis and part of Exodus, with elaborate chronological and legal additions), and a variety of Testaments of assorted Patriarchs, Visions, Ascensions, and Martyrdoms, Psalms, Odes, and Prophecies. These exist in a variety of languages, not only Greek and Latin, but also Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, Arabic, and Old Church Slavonic. Some are now known to have had pre-Christian Hebrew and / or Aramaic originals, or at least prototypes. Others seem to be of Hellenistic Jewish origin; still others are the work of Christians.  Protestant scholars, however, having another set of  &#34;Apocrypha&#34; to deal with already, preferred to use the term &#34;Pseudepigrapha,&#34; or &#34;False(ly ascribed) Writings&#34; to describe these historically debatable books. This term has tended to prevail, with &#34;Apocrypha&#34; thus being made available for Jerome's usage once again, by Christian and Jewish scholars alike.  Back at the turn of the century, Oxford University Press issued a major collection of translations of &#34;Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament,&#34; edited by R.H. Charles, in two volumes. It combined books from both categories, and included introductions and annotations. It was a monument of scholarship, and remained the standard work in English until the appearance of &#34;Old Testament Pseudepigrapha,&#34; edited by James H. Charlesworth, in the mid-1980s. In the meantime, the Revised Standard Version had made modern translations of the Apocryphal / Deuterocanonical books readily available, a practice continued, with improved textual scholarship, in the New Revised Standard Version, and The New English Bible. Of course, these books were included in Catholic translations, such as the Jerusalem Bible (revised as the New Jerusalem Bible) and the New American Version. There have also been translations of several of the books under Jewish auspices, and they are included in a separate series of Anchor Bible volumes.  The present volume began as a selective updating of the Charles &#34;Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.&#34;  Despite the title, Sparks omitted the works generally known as Apocrypha. The team which produced the volume concentrated on preparing on what were, in the end, new versions of selected Pseudepigrapha, based on new textual studies.  It managed to appear at about the same time, rather than before, the larger Charlesworth collection, and differs from it not only in scope but also in format, and intent. Although excellent scholarship and great care lie behind it, the Sparks collection lacks the elaborate textual and explanatory notes and critical discussions of its rival. The result is far easier to read, but will leave many readers frustrated for lack of information on these puzzling texts, many of which show clear signs of both Jewish and Christian contributions, not all of them representing the mainstream of either religion.  To conclude, this is one of two modern compendia of Pseudepigrapha in English translation. (There is also an obsolete collection, offering fewer texts in old translations, &#34;The Forgotten Books of Eden.&#34;) To the serious student, Charlesworth's two volumes are probably worth the added expense, but Sparks' collection has marked advantages for those would just like to read some of the stories and poems. Since neither is exactly inexpensive, I suggest trying to consult library copies before making a decision on which option best suits your needs and budget.  [Addendum, May 2017: I had forgotten I had ever done this review, so I did not update it with new information in 2013 (or subsequently). That new information was the publication the first of two volumes designed to supplement (and maybe in a couple of texts replace) the translations available in Charlesworth's &#34;The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha.&#34; This was &#34;Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: More Noncanonical Scriptures,&#34; edited by Richard Bauckham, James R.

They date from Roman times to the early Middle Ages (in the form given, some possibly a bit later). When originally published in the early decades of the twentieth century, it was an inexpensive alternative to R.H.  Charles'  two-volume collection of &#34;Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament,&#34; and the scholarship was not yet too out date. It has become increasing creaky with the passing of time, and the editing and publishing of new and better text editions of the works included, as well as enormous advances in linguistic and literary scholarship.<br /><br />&#34;Forgotten Books of Eden&#34; is sometimes handy for verifying quotations in older secondary literature (studies and surveys), and some of the translations, notably those by Rendel Harris, are quite attractive. However, either the two massive volumes of James H. Charlesworth's collection of &#34;Old Testament Pseudepigrapha,&#34; or &#34;The Apocryphal Old Testament&#34; (actually Pseudepigrapha), edited by H.F.D. Sparks as a partial replacement for Charles, would be better as a long-term investment. There are also various separate translations of some of the works included in these translations, and, less reliable but still worth some attention, separate reprints of some of the translations edited by Charles.<br /><br />These are all considerably more expensive, however, and &#34;Forgotten Books&#34; is not an unreasonable addition to a personal library -- if you remember that anything in it you want to use should be checked against more authoritative versions. If it contained all, instead of about half, of S.C. Malan's 1882 translation of the Ethiopic &#34;Conflict of Adam and Eve&#34; (with Satan) as &#34;The Book of Adam and Eve,&#34; considered too recent for the Charlesworth collection, it might stillbe a must-have.<br /><br />The collection has also been bound with another set of obsolete translations, this time of New Testament Apocrypha, &#34;The Lost Books of the Bible,&#34; which is also published separately.<br /><br />[Addendum,May 2017: I had forgotten doing this review, so I failed to update it in a timely manner -- such as in 2013.

Jung, Mircea Eliade, and Joseph Campbell	Books	5	39	47	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: Three World-Views	Professor Ellwood very properly informs the reader that he was himself a student of Mircea Eliade at the University of Chicago, so I suppose that I should mention that I am an acquaintance of Professor Ellwood (although not a student, but a fellow Tolkien-fan).  However, I am taking the time to review the book mainly because I enjoyed it tremendously, and learned a great deal from it. I would suggest it to anyone who has read a little of any, or all three, of the writers it presents, and is considering reading more. Doing so should reduce arguments about these sometimes-controversial figures, or at least put them on a better intellectual foundation.    \\"The Politics of Myth\\" analyzes the political and social thought -- or lack of thought -- of three influential writers of the middle and late twentieth century. It provides enough biographical detail to keep the reader grounded in reality, and just enough information on their theories of mythology to show how much, or how little, they are related to the cultural and political environments in which the three men worked. The story of their influence also receives some coverage, particularly in connection with the Bollingen Foundation's publications of Jung and Eliade, and Campbell's role as editor for the Bollingen Series.    Eliade and Jung both have had large readerships for relatively difficult writers on often esoteric subjects, and simplified versions of their views are widely distributed, not always accurately, or with attribution. The large number of people who became familiar with Joseph Campbell through Public Television will here discover something of his place in the intellectual world.    The book is neither an indictment nor a defense of these writers on mythology (among other subjects). I finished my first reading with some definite impressions. Eliade, sometimes dismissed as a Romanian Fascist, comes off as a disturbingly unpolitical man in an age of totalitarianisms, never quite grasping that his early literary celebrity in his native country made him a valuable asset to any movement which, even falsely, claimed him as a supporter. Jung appears as a hearty Swiss peasant, deeply provincial despite his vast learning and (flashes of) genius, unable or unwilling to see beyond the symbolic exterior of the Nazi movement for a very long time. Campbell, fortunate to live in a more benign political environment, is seen rejoicing that he has freed himself of his Irish Catholic background, not noticing that his disdain for Judaism, distrust of England, and sympathy for Germany, might have something to do with his upbringing. A second reading reminded me that this short book is packed with telling details, and will probably suggest other interpretations to other readers	2003-10-21

Although Michael Saso is best known for excellent works on Taoism in modern Taiwan (and latterly the mainland), &#34;Blue Dragon White Tiger&#34; is a description of the ritual life of Chinese popular religion (Confucian and Buddhist as well as Taoist), which closely relates the practices to underlying philosophical and cosmological concepts. I have found nothing at once so comprehensive and concise in English.  Taoism, which most broadly and effectively incorporates distinctly Chinese concepts, does receive the major attention. These portions of the book cover some of the same material as Saso's earlier &#34;Taoism and the Rite of Cosmic Renewal&#34; (1972, revised 1989) and &#34;The Teachings of Taoist Master Chuang&#34; (1978; corrected edition as &#34;Taoist Master Chuang,&#34; 2000. [Addendum: as of November 2016, a third, revised edition is available, as &#34;The Teachings of Daoist Master Zhuang.&#34; Among other changes, the transliterations are in the now-standard Pinyin.])   Taoism as a living religion has been seriously studied only in the last few decades, and Saso is a leading figure in this field. He has also worked on classical Taoist texts, non-Taoist popular beliefs, and Chinese Buddhism, however, so he is not presenting his own narrow specialization as the whole of Chinese religion.  The publisher informs us that &#34;camera-ready copy was supplied by the author,&#34; which gives the reader some confidence that the Chinese characters and the many charts, diagrams, and illustrations have been inserted at the right places. It may also account for some inconsistencies in layout, and possibly some less than sparkling passages on non-Chinese subjects.  As mentioned, Saso's reports on Chinese practices, and the beliefs associated with them by at least some Chinese, are based on solid research and personal experience. The author acknowledges the assistance of various Chinese scholars and ritual specialists, and of western Sinologists, including several of the Jesuits who had assisted his earlier fieldwork on Taiwan with Master Chuang. It is, however, fairly obvious who DIDN'T check the text for errors. In a passage comparing rituals of adult status on page 134, his references to Judaism confuse Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement -- part of a &#34;world-renewal&#34; ritual of a type familiar to Saso!) with the Bar Mitzvah (presenting a 13-year-old male as an adult for some important religious purposes). Not a big problem, but a sudden jolt to the reader who is aware of the difference. And a lost chance for an interesting comparison.	2003-10-16

It differs from the UK edition (which I have also reviewed) mainly by including &#34;Remarks on The City of Light &#34; by Wang Lianmao, in which modern Chinese scholarship is used to reply to some of the criticism directed against it by Westerners. Specialists in the history of the region find some puzzles, and probable errors made by a foreigner, but nothing to suggest a modern fraud. They seem willing to accept it as an authentic account of southern China by a foreigner, describing events shortly before the arrival of Marco Polo in the following of the Mongol (Yuan) conqueror. (Probably wisely, they do not seem to have offered an opinion on how authentic the foreigner -- an Italian Jew -- looks to them.)   Curiously, Frances Wood, whose &#34;Did Marco Polo Go to China?&#34; argues that the Venetian merchant stayed in western Asia, and got all his information from others, who left no record of their adventures, seems to have joined in denouncing Jacob of Ancona as a fabrication, even though this must have seemed like manna from heaven for her theory. (By the way, it seems clear to me that, despite various major and minor interpolations and deletions in the manuscript tradition, Marco Polo did travel in East Asia -- so maybe I'm gullible.)   I would add, from my own cursory research, that I have some problems with the supposedly convincing argument that the use of the term &#34;mellah&#34; for &#34;Jewish Quarter&#34; in Muslim lands is anachronistic. This argument depends on accepting one version of the etymology and history of the word. It is, however, less than completely certain; Roger Le Tourneau, in &#34;Fez in the Age of the Marinides&#34; (English translation 1961), reviewed the complicated evidence, and suggested that the consensus, including how long the word was in use and when and where it was adopted, might be wrong.   From a Jewish perspective, I can accept Jacob ofAncona as a plausible figure (and perhaps more typical than Selbourne, to judge from his notes, realizes). The combination of length and literary quality in a memoir seems unusual for the period, but the translator reports omitting some sections at the end, and felicitous translation can add charm without being unfaithful.

Like Dante, they lived in a mental world which is now remote and foreign. No matter how universal Shakespeare, or Ben Jonson, or Christopher Marlowe, may seem, it is easy to miss the points of their statements, take the commonplace for the original, the new for the ordinary, and generally impose our own thoughts on their words.<br /><br />This was in fact the common practice in the eighteenth and nineteenth century (with some honorable exceptions), but some of the great scholars of the Victorian Age began to try to restore the intellectual context of an epoch that was no longer entirely medieval, but not really modern.  Their approach gradually filtered down to students through articles and commentaries. Or, as in this case, an independent introduction to the subject.<br /><br />For over half of the twentieth century, E.M.W. Tillyard's handy summary of \\"The Elizabethan World Picture\\" gave countless undergraduates, and many curious readers, a short introduction to an often unfamiliar world. A world in which your health rested on a proper balance of humours, which were not your reaction to jokes, but substances flowing through your body. A world in which the Four Elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) were part of a hierarchy beginning with God, and including all the ranks of human beings. A world which was beginning to crumble, as the Eternal Truths of Christianity became contingent on political events, and which needed reassurance, even in popular entertainment.<br /><br />Tillyard was an interesting critic (he had a famous debate on critical theory with C.S. Lewis, published as \\"The Personal Heresy\\"). His major works include a full study of Shakespeare's History Plays, in which he worked out in detail their relation to Elizabethan political theory. It is a little ironic that he may be best known for this short textbook, in which he did not set out to say anything particularly new or original. There are longer, more comprehensive, and far better documented books on the subjects he covers in \\"The Elizabethan World Picture,\\" but it would be hard to find so convenient and focussed an entrance into this particular lost world of the imagination.	2003-10-12

It was natural that he turned his Greco-German name into Greco-Latin, labeling himself Georgius Agricola. Both versions mean Farmer (Georgios) Farmer (Pawer = Bauer / Agricola). He was a physician by profession. Neither side of his background would seem to suit him to write one of the great books on mining and the refining of ores, but as an official town physician, responsible for treating miners at no additional charge, he seems to have won their trust. The result was a manual, aimed not at people who would have to dig up ores, but at potential investors, and officials and lawyers, who would have to deal with financing, administration and litigation. He set out the basic customs and practices of mining, described the remarkably elaborate machines needed to keep mines dry and ventilated, and processing and refining, with their devices and chemicals. Naturally, he wrote it in the language of real scholarship, Latin, not sixteenth-century German.<br /><br />Since surviving classical Latin is not abundantly supplied with appropriate technical terms, and those which exist are not always clear, the resulting text was soon found to present formidable difficulties, despite important aids from accompanying illustrations. There were early attempts at translating it into German, and even a rendering into Chinese (an early attempt to emulate the mysterious Occidentals and their terror-weapons), but when this translation appeared in 1912, German scholars were humiliated to find that they had been outclassed by a couple of mere \\"Englanders\\". They were probably even less happy to find that the translators were Americans.<br /><br />Actually, Lou Henry Hoover, a good classicist, made a perfect team with her husband, the mining engineer Herbert Hoover, who was shortly to become much better known for humanitarian relief work, and an unhappy experience as President of the United States. The engineering half of the partnership knew what the problems were, and the sort of thing that Agricola must have been trying to say, and the classicist could tell whether the vocabulary and grammar could carry that meaning. The result was a book which was not only beautiful, with its reproductions of the original illustrations, but a genuine contribution to the history of technology.<br /><br />The Dover reprinting of 1950 was one of the first, if not the first, of that publisher's adventures in bringing important works back into print, in attractive editions, at reasonable prices. It remains a gem, whether regarded from points of view of the history of technology, of art, or of Renaissance Humanism. The only thing missing is Agricola's companion treatise on other hazards of mining, like kobolds and other malicious spirits (yes, I am serious; he had lots of testimony from honest miners, after all).<br /><br />Of course, nothing human is perfect, and there are some hints of why such a practical man as Herbert Hoover, with a real concern for human suffering, proved so doctrinaire in the face of the Depression. At one point, the Hoovers scold the Romans for concentrating on German metal resources, instead of trying to build up the only true source of wealth, Agriculture. A lovely sentiment, very eighteenth-century Physiocratic, but it did not seem to occur to them that any agricultural surplus would have had to be shipped down the Rhine, into the North Sea, and around Europe, to be of any immediate benefit to Rome. If it stayed in Germany, it would just feed more nasty, Roman-hating Germans -- so much better to concentrate on something more compact and worth carrying across the Alps, or at least useful for arming the Legions. (Of course, there are also the problems of whether Italian agricultural techniques were of any value in the Rhine valley, and why the Germans had not learned appropriate methods from the neighboring Gauls -- but that leads in other directions.)	2003-10-12

It explains in detail the doctrine of the Sefirot (or Sephirot), the creative emanations of the unknowable God. It arranges them in ascending order (toward Divine Totality), rather than the descending order (toward the Created World) in which they are usually presented. It has been suggested that it could, therefore, at least in theory, be used as a meditation guide, although it does not seem to have been considered even devotional reading. (Descriptions of Kabbalistic meditation practices were rarely committed to writing, so the absence of evidence on this point may not be evidence of absence, but so far as I know this is only a reasonable speculation.)    \\"Gates of Light\\" is a clear exposition (well, clear for mystical theology), rather than a series of parables to be interpreted, which may account for its being studied, but not often quoted, and not being the subject of commentaries by later Kabbalists. It also suffered from being known as the work of a \\"modern\\" writer, in medieval Spain, instead of being offered, like the \\"Zohar,\\" as a rediscovered text from the time of the Talmudic sages. \\"Gates of Light\\" may still be too sparse in language to appeal to devotional readers, but I would hope that those with a personal, spiritual, interest in Kabbalah would use it to improve their grasp of the intellectual foundations of the movement.    Students of the history of Kabbalah, to whom the translation seems mainly directed, will find this translation of great interest. So will students of Kabbalah in history (a slightly different topic). Although the book was eclipsed in fame in its own time and later by the \\"Zohar,\\" an abridged Latin version was influential in Christian circles during the Renaissance, when ultimately Neo-Platonic theories of divine emanations were extremely popular. Its availability in English is therefore of importance outside the circles of those interested in Judaica, or in Kabbalah in particular.     I have one, relatively minor, objection to this version. For some reason, the translator has chosen to render the technical term for emanations, \\"Sefirot\\" (singular form \\"Sefirah\\"), as \\"Spheres,\\" as though it derived from the Greek \\"sphaira.\\" As Gershom Scholem, among others, demonstrated at length, the actual origin is the root \\"sfr,\\" originally referring to counting or numbers. The word \\"sefer,\\" meaning \\"book\\" (i.e., an account of things) is the most generally familiar form to those with a little Hebrew. \\"Sefirah\\" was also linked, as a significant word-association, with the Biblical word \\"sappir,\\" meaning a gem (Greek and Latin \\"sapphire,\\" but not necessarily the modern stone).  The pun on \\"sphaira,\\" the Greek word for \\"ball\\" does eventually appear in the literature, but it does not seem likely to have had much currency in thirteenth-century Spain. The translator's decision makes for easier reading, but it could suggest extraneous associations, such as the crystalline spheres of medieval astronomy (and some sort of Kabbalistic astrology). This is indeed a minor objection, but the reader unfamiliar with the field may find the choice confusing, and the subject is already esoteric.	2003-10-12

Descriptions and quotations tended to make it sound like Pliny's \\"Natural History,\\" only dull. Birrell has made it read like an appendix to a Chinese Ovid, but more entertaining. Earlier attempts at translation that I have seen (mainly, it is true, of passages, often discontinuous) have been, at least from my point of view, almost unreadable. The self-imposed burden of trying to identify places and tribes can reduce even a few pages of what is reputed to be a fascinating, and sometimes whimsical, work to something more like an ordeal to read. To say nothing of the careful reproduction of Chinese names, which mean nothing to a reader who needs an English version!<br /><br />Birrell has chosen to treat the \\"Classic of Mountains and Seas\\" as a somewhat eccentric work of literature, which can be read for pleasure, like \\"Mandeville's Travels,\\" or, to use other medieval European examples, Bestiaries and Lapidaries (accounts of strange beasts and the miraculous properties of precious stones). Although some sections are more consistently interesting than others, most pages hold something to keep the reader's attention. Since I can't judge the plausibility of Birrell's translations of Chinese names, I will say that I found her versions amusing. (I also noted the apparent ultimate source of the \\"Pokemon\\" convention that strange animals are named for the sounds they make, which happen to have meanings.)<br /><br />As a long-time reader of myths and legends, fantasy, and science fiction, I have fairly high standards for the entertainment level of a book about strange lands, peoples, and creatures. Taken as a whole, I found Birrell's translation entertaining and intriguing. Its major defects (lack of aidesto the reader) could be, and I hope will be, repaired in some expanded edition in the future. For now, I am grateful to have it. The ethnographic, religious, geographical, and historical implications are fascinating -- and more properly the subject of a full commentary than a literary work for the Penguin Classics.<br /><br />[Addendum, September 2013: no second-thoughts about this review, but a piece of information I omitted ten years ago: Anne Birrell also wrote at least one study of the text, \\"Gendered Power: A Discourse on Female-Gendered Myth in the 'Classic of Mountains and Seas',\\" a 50-some-page paper originally published as SINO-PLATONIC PAPERS No. 120 (July 2002). She says: \\"In this paper I argue that this ancient text privileges female gender in an unprecedented way in the ancient Chinese cultural tradition.\\" I left it out because at the time it was rather expensive (more than the whole translation!); I mention it now because the text is available free on the web (search SINO-PLATONIC PAPERS) -- in fact has been since 2006. Which I've known for a couple of years, although I failed to make the connection until recently.]	2003-10-10

Both are worth the serious student's time, but as part of the Peoples of Europe series &#34;The Goths&#34; is clearly intended to serve as an introduction to the main events, persons, and problems.  Peter Heather's view of the emergence, actions, divisions, and fates of the people (or groups) identified in Greek and Latin texts as Goths, Ostrogoths, and Visigoths is modern and sophisticated, but a lot less ponderous and a lot more conclusive than Wolfram's sifting of the evidence. He frequently disagrees with Wolfram (for reasons which can sometimes be traced in Wolfram's extended discussions and notes), but Heather reaches reasonable conclusions at each stage. He proceeds to build on them, to a limited extent, while trying to keep speculation firmly under control.  This attempt to stay true to available data tends to limit what is covered. In the nineteenth century, and at the turn of the twentieth, a limited amount of archeology and a lot of data gathered from later Germanic peoples were thrown together to produce detailed descriptions of the supposed daily lives and customs of the Goths. Instead of these interesting descriptions, we find only the most careful use of archeological and comparative data to flesh out the meager record. This is not as satisfying, but a lot more trustworthy.  What once were accepted conclusions about how the Goths behaved and governed in Gaul, Spain, and Italy also have been called into question. Instead, we are left with questions of how they exploited the territories they occupied, and who was doing the administering. Heather makes some reasonable suggestions, but avoids getting more specific than the evidence will warrant. The result is heavily weighted to military and political events,which were what contemporary reports mainly described.	2003-10-10

As such it is part of a large class of Tibetan Buddhist works.    The text had previously been translated into English at the instigation of W.Y. Evans-Wentz, who published that version in \\"The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation\\" which appeared in 1954 as the last of four volumes in the pioneering  \\"Oxford Tibetan Series,\\" which had begun in 1927 with another terma text, the \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead.\\"    The \\"Self-Liberation\\" treatise there followed an abridged translation of one of the traditional biographies of Padmasambhava, the legendary \\"Apostle to the Tibetans,\\" and one of their patron Bodhisattvas, who is regarded as the real author of this and other works. These texts were surrounded by commentaries by Evans-Wentz and C.G. Jung. The latter is probably important for students of Jung. Evans-Wentz's contributions generally reflect a lack of information about esoteric Buddhism, and a tendency to substitute material from Hindu and Theosophical sources.    Having compared the present translation (pages 9-28) with that offered by Evans-Wentz, I can say that it appears to be superior in clarity. Given the present, far more advanced state of Tibetan studies, it is certainly more likely to be accurate than the ad-hoc attempt provided by Evans-Wentz's translators. Additional features include the Tibetan text in transliteration, a glossary of Tibetan Buddhist terms, and an extended commentary. This is undoubtedly an advance on Evans-Wentz, although its devotional tone may seem cloying to some readers (including this one)    There are also extended discussions of the Evans-Wentz and Jung interpretations. The dismissal of Jung is particularly interesting; although I don't much care for Jung myself, I felt that he was not being given sufficient credit for trying to take Asian traditions as seriously as he took those closer to home. (Of course, given Jung's reductionist approach to religion, this may amount to 0 = 0.)	2003-10-10

On the one hand, you could go along with Alexander Pope in his \\"Essay on Criticism,\\" and declare of the fall of Rome, \\"A second deluge learning thus o'errun, / And the monks finished what the Goths begun\\" (which is particularly pointed, given that Pope himself was a Catholic).    On the other hand, you could praise them. The reasons for favoring the Goths were somewhat diverse. For example, the Victorian socialist and poet (and designer and fantasy novelist, etc.) William Morris portrayed them as wonderful examples of folk-solidarity against the corruption and imperialism of Rome.    In Germany, at the same time, historians announced that they were convinced that the Goths demonstrated how the Germanic Race brought Freedom back into the world -- just like the Kaiser! (Leading Nietzsche to ask the difference between such a Conviction and an ordinary Lie. He also expressed relief that the ancient Germans, whose inferior blood had helped destroy the Roman Empire through intermarriage, were NOT ancestors of the modern Germans.)    In America, broad-minded scholars, brought up on the doctrine of Anglo-Saxon Liberty (and the Norman Yoke), rushed to recognize the continental Goths as honorary Anglo-Saxons, extending a privileged status to at least some Europeans.    All of these views (including Nietzsche's) depended on the assumption that the name Goth (and its variants) in ancient and early medieval texts always meant the same thing, and that the Ostrogoths and Visigoths were simply branches of the same original tribe -- \\"tribe\\" too being a term taken for granted (along with translating *gens* as *race*). This made things simple for archeologists; dig up something of about the right age in a place where \\"Goths\\" were supposed to have been living, and you know it was \\"Gothic.\\" Find something similar someplace else, and you had discovered Goths.    Herwig Wolfram, reviewing another century of scholarship,shows that there are problems with every one of these assumptions (including Pope's). Even leaving aside the problem of the whole idea of a \\"tribe\\" as a recognizable entity (whether social or biological), ancient sources on the Goths and their divisions are not easy to understand. Entirely different population groups sometimes seem to have acquired the label, only to shed it again. Efforts to find a principle of continuity in royal dynasties follow the propaganda of self-promoted kings. And, of course, a whole body of writing from the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth is interwoven with theories of racial superiority.    None of this makes for easy reading, or straightforward narrative. Instead, we get the clearing away of misconceptions, and an effort to evaluate competing modern theories. This is a really valuable book for anyone seriously interested in the problems associated with the later Roman Empire and the emergence of Barbarian Kingdoms in Italy and Spain.

Bowra's translation of \\"The Odes of Pindar\\" for the Penguin Classics, not Richmond Lattimore's version from the University of Chicago Press, my review of which has been appearing under this heading as well. Fortunately, I rank Bowra's work as highly as Lattimore's, so I won't have to quibble over how many stars should be assigned. Lattimore's translation is, at the moment, out of print; one hopes that Penguin will keep Bowra's available. I will refer to a third translation, as well.    Pindar was one of the most famous poets of ancient Greece, and besides fragments (which are all that survive of most of his rivals) we have four reasonably intact books out of a much larger collection. As it happens, the four books contain celebrations of victors at major Games (Olympic and three others, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean), and are otherwise unlike what moderns think of as typical poetry. They are also densely allusive, and in a Greek which is generally acknowledged to be as difficult to follow as it is beautiful. My own command of Greek is too small to judge, but Bowra is one of several modern translators who have managed to persuade me to read him for pleasure, rather just than for his allusions to myths and heroic legend.    Bowra, who also wrote a major work on Pindar, provides useful annotations to a very attractive translation. He also decided to arrange the poems according to their likely dates, or at least the dates assigned to them by ancient scholars who had list of victors in the various games. There are inherent problems with this, since some of the Odes actually relate to victories in other Games, and some were certainly performed at delayed celebrations. On the whole, however, it does give some sense of Pindar as a developing poet, and of the Victory Ode as a form continuing to grow during his career.    The real drawback is the need to consult a table of references to find any given poem. This can be a real annoyance for a student if Bowra is the only translation you have on hand, and you really want to check a statement supported by a reference to, say, Olympian 3, lines 7 to 10. In most translations, you can just follow the page headings.    Bowra's critical writings on Pindar are now considered obsolete -- at least for the moment His translation remains worth reading, and compares well with Lattimore's, and with Richard Stoneman's recent expanded edition, with excellent critical material,  of G.S. Conway's translation of the Odes, which first appeared a few years after Bowra's.    This last was Issued as \\"Odes: and Selected Fragments,\\" in the Everyman Paperback Classics series, and I have reviewed it, with a more extended discussion of Pindar and related critical disputes. I am glad to have all three; it would be nice if all of them were all in print simultaneously. A fourth alternative, with a translation facing the Greek texts, is the Loeb Classical Library edition, re-edited in two volumes by William H. Race (1997), which is probably a bit too intimidating for the merely curious reader.	2003-10-08

Allen & Co., Ltd., London), this classic, and somewhat controversial, book has gone through several title changes, including the very accurate \\"Tibetan Buddhism: With Its Mystic Cults, Symbolism and Mythology,\\" when reprinted by Dover Publications in 1972 (currently in print, and, as a handsomely produced volume at a very reasonable price, my personal choice.) The Kessinger edition, reviewed here, follows one of the reprintings under the original title.    It was in its time a landmark in English-language writings on Tibet, and it still retains some value for its rich visual documentation, in the form of photographs and line drawings. (Unfortunately, Kessinger editions are not well-known for such contents; and reports suggest that individual copies of their editions differ in quality.) There are some remarkably clear descriptions of shrines and temples, costumes and ritual practices, objects and images. Given the massive destruction of Tibetan religious sites in China as well as Tibet, much of what he recorded will never be seen again.    Unfortunately, the author all too frequently confides in the reader his distaste for the religion he is describing, and his contempt for its functionaries. I gave up on the book for this reason when I first tried to read it. Some Amazon reviewers (responding to other editions) seem to think that Waddell must have known what he was talking about, and accept his characterizations at face value, which is a pity.    In part this attitude may be self-defense. It seems that Waddell got access to some of his information by becoming the owner/patron of a Tibetan Buddhist temple in Peking, and probably felt that he had to make clear to his pious readers back home in England that he was not really a wicked idolater. Some of his expressions of disdain seem to reflect real misunderstandings: having failed to grasp that the word \\"lama\\" means \\"teacher of religion,\\" not \\"monk,\\" he is scandalized to discover the occasional married lama. (This response probably relates to intra-Christian issues as well -- see below.)    Then, too, there is the idealized image of Theraveda Buddhism from Ceylon, which had introduced itself to Europeans as the true, pure, original, non-superstitious Buddhism, not to be confused with those self-styled Buddhisms found elsewhere. With that vision as the standard of purity, the versions found in northern Asia would automatically seem defective, and Waddell takes it for granted. (It should be remembered that the Mahayana, or \\"Great Vehicle,\\" versions of Buddhism, like that of Tibet, tend to refer to the Theraveda teachings as the Hinayana, or \\"Lesser Vehicle.\\")    Finally, Waddell, apparently writing for a solidly \\"anti-Papist\\" readership, sometimes seems unable to distinguish the images and rituals of Mahayana Buddhism, in its various forms, from parallel practices in Catholicism, and is glad to condemn both.    Worth reading today? Well, the book is still cited, with diffidence, by scholars far more sympathetic to the subject, and far better informed about it, for its extraordinary amount of factual documentation. For a novice in Tibetan studies, I would suggest starting with a solid introduction, like Snellgrove and Richardson's \\"Cultural History of Tibet,\\" and those looking for further information might continue with a responsible modern study, such as Giuseppe Tucci's \\"The Religions of Tibet.\\" You could probably turn to Waddell for details after reading either one.    For those interested in a \\"sampler,\\" I point out that Waddell published in 1894 a similar, but much, much shorter, volume (under 200 pages) on Sikkim, as \\"Lamaism in Sikhim\\" (his spelling). This has long been out of print, but an Adobe Reader pdf of the book has been made available as a set of free downloads, with due warning of Waddell's biases, as part of the bibliography section for \\"Himalayan Art Resources\\" at himalayanart.org. It might be helpful to check out \\"Waddell Lite\\" before deciding on the bigger book. And the whole bibliography there may be helpful, too.	2003-10-08

The very accurate \\"Tibetan Buddhism: With Its Mystic Cults, Symbolism and Mythology,\\" is the one under which it was reprinted by Dover Publications in 1972 (the edition reviewed here). I have also reviewed one of the more recent printings, under the original title, and these two reviews are largely, but not completely, duplicates. The Dover edition, being well-produced and (for now) quite reasonably priced, would be my suggestion if you want a copy; but I advise this with some cautions about the book itself.    The book was in its time a landmark in English-language writings on Tibet, and it still retains some value for its rich visual documentation, in the form of photographs and line drawings. There are some remarkably clear descriptions of shrines and temples, costumes and ritual practices, objects and images. Given the massive destruction of Tibetan religious sites in China as well as Tibet, much of what he recorded will never be seen again. The Dover edition has made a storehouse of raw information available for thirty years, during which interest in, and information about, traditional Tibetan religion has been steadily growing.    Unfortunately, Waddell all too frequently confides in the reader his distaste for the religion he is describing, and his contempt for its functionaries. I gave up on the book for this reason when I first tried to read it. Some Amazon reviewers (of this and other editions) seem to think that Waddell must have known what he was talking about, and some of them accept his characterizations at face value, which is a pity.

I was in the midst of some research on Himalayan cultures in general. I put that project on hold while I finished Tucci's exposition of the varieties and development of religions (Buddhist and other) in Tibet. It was not easy reading, but it gave reasonable answers to questions that I had puzzled over for years, and suggested new problems. I consider it a must-read for the serious student, although a more basic introduction, such as Snellgrove and Richardson's &#34;Cultural History of Tibet&#34; (now going into its third edition) would be a much better place to start.  Although the book was somewhat obsolete when the English translation (itself a revision) appeared, this fact is a measure of the rapid progress being made in Tibetan studies in the West. (A result of Chinese attempts to destroy Tibetan culture, this illustrates the Iron Law of Unintended Consequences, a secular version of karma.) Major advances have been made, for example, in publication of materials related to Bon, the &#34;other&#34; religion of Tibet. Tucci, however, lays a solid foundation for understanding what the new information means.  This is the sort of book I hoped for when, years ago, I gave up on the recently-issued Dover edition of Waddell's &#34;Lamaism&#34; (as &#34;Tibetan Buddhism&#34;), the standard work in English at the beginning of the Twentieth Century. &#34;Religions of Tibet&#34; is based on critical scholarship, but respects the religious traditions it describes and analyses. It will probably not please the devoted Buddhist who reads it, but it does not assume a standpoint of superiority grounded in a rival religion, or in some secular substitute.	2003-10-08
US	30081986	R1QMYSYDB8E7ZS	0866980415	225796636	Three Books on Life (MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE TEXTS AND STUDIES) (English and Italian Edition)	Books	5	40	41	N	Y	Ian Myles Slater on: A Difficult Job Done Well	In the second half of the twentieth century, readers of English who were interested in the Renaissance had their attention drawn to Ficino's &#34;Three Books on Life&#34; (known by various titles, such as &#34;Liber de Vita&#34; and &#34;De Vita Triplici&#34;) by several influential books. Chief among them were D.P. Walker's &#34;Spiritual and Demonic Magic: From Ficino to Campanella&#34; and Frances A. Yates' &#34;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition.&#34; The many readers of Robert Burton's seventeenth-century masterpiece &#34;The Anatomy of Melancholy&#34; had already encountered frequent citations of &#34;Ficinus&#34; on melancholy, its causes and cure. Any attempt to find an English translation, or even a good text of the Latin original, however, came up with nothing.<br /><br />For a moment it seemed that Charles Boer had provided one with &#34;The Book of Life,&#34; originally published in 1980, and currently in print. It was an attractively printed and extremely readable translation. Unfortunately, it was not only based on unreliable versions of the Latin, but it paid little if any attention to the vast scholarship needed to understand Ficino. Since Boer was dismissive of the existing Ficino scholarship, hostile reviews were perhaps to be expected, but I can testify from experience that Boer's work was more frustrating than useful.<br /><br />Fortunately, a far superior translation, along with a carefully edited Latin text, useful introduction and helpful notes, and glossarial indexes, was already in progress. It appeared about a decade later, and, like Boer's, has been reprinted several times. It is an impressive accomplishment, providing a rich source of information on Ficino's theological, philosophical, medical, astrological, and magical readings and world-view, and how they interact.<br /><br />Ficino, famous in his day and in histories of philosophy as the pioneering translator of Plato and the Neo-Platonists (a distinction made long after his time), was the son of a physician, which in those days meant an astrologer. He was trained in his father's profession, but also as a priest, and read the Aristotle of the late Scholastics as well as Plato and his followers, and his supposed source, the books attributed to the Egyptian sage, Hermes Trismegistus. Bits and pieces of all of these interests, and others, appear in the &#34;Books on Life,&#34; which are in large measure an attempt to avoid the negative implications of Ficino's own horoscope, which was dominated by the influence of Saturn, seeming to doom him to lethargy and sickness.<br /><br />In the process, he worked a minor revolution in European thought, which is still with us today. He did this by finding good aspects to melancholy, which in the tradition he had inherited was a disease, combining aspects of depression and mania. He argued that it was also a producer of scholarship and wisdom, helping to launch both the modern idea of &#34;genius&#34; and the suspicion that it has some connection with insanity.<br /><br />Ficino also argued for special diets to control the negative aspects (lots of sugar and cinnamon), and, in a controversial final section, for astrological talismans to concentrate good forces and repel bad ones. This was dangerous ground, obviously shading into magic, and protesting that he was vindicating Free Will against astrological determinism was not much of a cover.<br /><br />Although a very high proportion of the thousands of websites mentioning Ficino seem interested mainly in Ficino the Great Astrologer or Ficino the Renaissance Platonist, he was a lot more complicated, as Kaske and Clark make clear. Nothing will make &#34;&#34;Three Books on Life&#34; easy reading, but they have done everything possible to make it intelligible to modern readers.	2003-10-07

Jusserand's \\"English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages\\" was first published in English by Ernest Benn Ltd., in 1889, as translated by Lucy Toulmin Smith. The last revised edition was published in 1920, by which time it was already showing its age, as the occasional attempts to bring it up to date reveal. Despite a nineteenth-century flavor of antiquarian curiosity-collecting, it retained a following, and was reprinted soon after World War II (1950). I have a University Paperback reprint (Methuen & Co., Ltd., London, and Barnes and Noble Inc., New York), originally issued in 1961.    In the late 1960s it was still fairly common to see it cited in bibliographies and suggested reading lists, usually in connection with \\"The Canterbury Tales,\\" but sometimes with a book for children, \\"Adam of the Road,\\" by Elizabeth Janet Gray (1942; itself currently in print).  There were apparently reprintings during the 1970s and 1980s which I have not seen. Now, well past the book's centennial, it is available from Kessinger. I would not be surprised to see it picked up by another publisher.    What, except inertia in non-medievalist circles, and perhaps a certain (limited) practical utility for readers of Chaucer, has kept the book going? It continues to be available in the face of several revolutions in approaches to the Middle Ages, and a basic shift in scholarship from anecdotes and quaint customs to elaborate documentation and tightly focused questions. Other, more technically distinguished, books on medieval life languish out of print, and \\"English Wayfaring Life\\" still goes on -- and on, and on.    Mainly, I think, it is the book's sheer charm. Jusserand had read a great deal, and selected really interesting bits and pieces to fit together in a loose framework. Despite the juxtaposition of possibly atypical incidents from a wide variety of times and several regions of the British Isles, the idea of presenting the types of people, places, and events a medieval traveler might have encountered makes the book feel like a narrative, rather than a rummage-sale bin. And Jusserand (and the translator!) could really write. Although the presentation is occasionally cloying, and the grasp of \\"modern\\" science and medicine sometimes so vague as to be amusing, Jusserand obviously likes the world waiting to be discovered in old documents, and wants the reader to share this interest.    J. J. Jusserand also wrote \\"A Literary History of the English People,\\" which Tolkien alluded to with contempt in a public lecture (\\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\\"). Years ago I tried to read it, on the strength of \\"Wayfaring Life,\\" and I understand Tolkien's annoyance. Jusserand there seemed to value anything in English in direct proportion to its similarity to something in French, and attributed anything he didn't comprehend to English muddle-headedness -- or beer. (If only those Anglo-Saxons drank more wine!) Michael Drout has an account of the matter in his edition of Tolkien's \\"Beowulf and the Critics.\\"     But in \\"Wayfaring Life,\\" Jusserand mostly stuck to concrete details, didn't pass off literary judgments as historical facts (at least not often enought to remember), and is fun, if hardly as authoritative as he perhaps imagined.	2003-10-07

One of the problems I had in mind is that the division into two volumes, while sensible in itself, does not follow the standard order of the books, but groups them geographically. Pausanias should have done this himself, but the innovation means flipping between the volumes when looking up cross-references to originally adjacent material, and really complicates using references in other volumes. Still, this is not an insurmountable problem, and should not be an objection if (when?) this translation is returned to the Penguin list. Of course, the Penguin Classics are currently (2003) being reprinted in a larger format, and that may prove an occasion for altering the \\"Guide to Greece\\" in a new edition<br /><br />[Notes, September 2013: As will be evident to anyone reading this on Amazon, Penguin has since issued the \\"Guide\\" in a Kindle edition -- still in two \\"volumes\\" (which I find annoying). There do NOT appear to be any revisions.

Frazer (yes, the author of \\"The Golden Bough,\\" and quite a bit more) has been reprinted, in hardcover and paperback editions. However, it is available *free* as a set of pdf files on Archive.org (a Library of Congress website), along with some translations from the eighteenth- and earlier nineteenth-centuries, which are mainly of curiosity value, unless one is tracing a history of scholarship on some place or topic. Frazer's impressive Classical scholarship still makes his four volumes of commentary (plus a separate index volume) a useful guide to other Classical sources and previous studies. Frazer's translation (in the first volume) is, naturally, rather Victorian-sounding, but not without literary merit.]lation (in the first volume) is, naturally, rather Victorian-sounding, but not without literary merit.]	2003-10-06

Lewis' \\"The Allegory of Love\\" (as slightly emended later) to the 2013 Kindle edition of the book from HarperCollins. I've decided to up-date it, using my 2012 review of a paperback edition as a basis. You also can find reviews by others  under some of the various, separate, Amazon listings of the title.]<br /><br />\\"The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition\\" is the book which made C.S. Lewis' reputation as a critic of medieval and renaissance literature, in advance of his later fame as a Christian apologist, a fantasy writer, or a poet; his earliest works in these fields having been published under pseudonyms.<br /><br />\\"The Allegory of Love\\" was first published in 1936, and has been reprinted many times, in hardcover at least into the 1970s, and in paperback from the late 1950s. Unfortunately, it has been out of print for some time, and third-party offering of re-printings (which have been listed separately by Amazon) have been rather high-priced.<br /><br />It is therefore a pleasure to report that it has been scheduled for re-release in December 2013, by Cambridge University Press (Canto imprint); and that, as of November, HarperCollins has made a less expensive version available on Kindle, with hyper-linked notes (but no index; apparently the Kindle Search Engine is supposed to serve, IF you can remember the spellings of medieval names....).<br /><br />There is (or was) another Kindle edition, without the notes, but using the cover art of what was the most recent Canto edition. I have no information on the legality of this (it is NOT from Cambridge University Press), but, given its truncated form, I don't find even the lower price asked for it to be really attractive.<br /><br />As originally written, \\"Allegorical Love Poems of the Middle Ages\\" (the working title) covered the development of allegorical narrative from late classical times to Spenser's \\"Faerie Queene,\\" with particular attention to the representation of human emotions (not strictly limited to love). It covered several related topics as well; for example, medieval theories of dreams, and how they compare to the use of dream-narratives as vehicles for allegories. It does not deal with Bunyan's \\"Pilgrim's Progress,\\" probably the best-known allegorical work in English; not only is it a century too late, it is theological and moral, rather than psychological.<br /><br />Instead of following the then-prevailing fashion of dismissing allegory as \\"frigid\\" or \\"artificial,\\" Lewis examined why it was used, and how it functioned to portray abstractions like emotions or inner turmoil in dramatic terms. In doing so, he was paralleling developments in art history (see, for examples, works by Gombrich, Panofsky, Seznec, and Edgar Wind, among others). How this stereotype became established in English, in the face of Bunyan's popularity, however, is not a topic he felt it necessary to address.<br /><br />Unhappily for his book's long-term reputation, Lewis was persuaded to add to the planned text an earlier summary of modern theories of \\"courtly love\\" in medieval life and literature. Lewis himself noted that this theoretical construction did not quite fit the texts he analyzed in detail, and the whole approach is now regarded as at best problematic, and by many as simply wrong.<br /><br />Since Lewis presented the material with unusual clarity and wit, however, he has come to be treated as an authoritative source by some, and attacked as such by others.<br /><br />The rest of the book, being based on original studies of primary sources, retains much of its value. Later textual studies and shifts in critical theory have only slightly diminished its value, and his discussions of such now-obscure writers as Martianus Capella and Bernardus Silvestris remain among the most inviting of introductions.<br /><br />(Capella is perhaps slightly less obscure these days. An on-line professional journal, \\"The Medieval Review,\\" published a few years ago Michael Herren's review of Teeuwen, Mariken, and Sin&eacute;ad O'Sullivan, \\"Carolingian Scholarship and Martianus Capella: Ninth-Century Commentary Traditions on 'De nuptiis' in Context,\\" Cultural Encounters in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages 12 [2011]. For Bernardus, see my review of Winthrop Wetherbee's translation of \\"The Cosmographia of Bernardus Silvestris.\\")<br /><br />Lewis writes engagingly of Chretien de Troyes Arthurian romances, in which the thoughts and emotions of characters are represented by brief allegories. Lewis' treatment of \\"The Romance of the Rose,\\" in which allegory replaces literal narrative, one of the most popular secular works of the Middle Ages, is still illuminating (and the point of departure for many recent re-considerations). His chapter on \\"The Faerie Queene\\" is regarded by some competent scholars as the foundation of modern study of the unfinished Elizabethan epic.<br /><br />Although Lewis never looses sight of the entertainment value of many of the works he discusses (and some of them never had any), he is concerned to show that they addressed real problems of human behavior and emotions, and their presentation in narratives. In \\"Inventing the Middle Ages,\\" Norman Cantor reported from first-hand experience that the book helped make the study of medieval romances respectable in academic circles. My own reading of the secondary literature brought me to a similar conclusion.<br /><br />It is probably of interest to note that, according to Lewis himself, the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" did not arise from his studies of allegory, and that their allegorical implications arose spontaneously in his mind. One has to wonder whether he would have written \\"The Allegory of Love\\" differently after, rather than before, those experiences. And how they relate to his experience with the early \\"Pilgrim's Regress: An Allegorical Apology for Christianity, Reason, and Romanticism,\\" published under a pen name in 1933.)<br /><br />Also, some of the medieval material which Lewis used in his theological science fiction novel, \\"Out of the Silent Planet,\\" and its successors, is discussed in its historical and literary context.<br /><br />Serious students of English literature, and medieval literature in general, will find \\"The Allegory of Love\\" more than worth their time. So will those who simply enjoy reading Arthurian literature, and several other types of story. For many who are familiar only with Lewis the fantasist, or Lewis the Christian apologist, it will open new perspectives.<br /><br />Those who wish to follow the development of Lewis' thought on some of these issues and authors can consult his collected papers and essays on medieval and other literature, his massive \\"English Literature in the Sixteenth Century,\\" and the \\"The Discarded Image,\\" published just after his death, a brief and witty summing-up of the world-view underlying most medieval literature.	2003-10-06

Lord's \\"Singer of Tales\\" was published in 1960, as Number 24 of the \\"Harvard Studies in Comparative Literature,\\" and was picked up in paperback by Atheneum only a few years later (1965). Over the course of four decades, and a variety of reprintings, \\"The Singer of Tales\\" has established itself as probably the most widely read book in the monograph series, and the most controversial. It is certainly the best known of its author's books and articles.    \\"The Singer of Tales\\" is established as a fundamental work in the study of oral literatures, and literatures which appear to have emerged from oral traditions (Biblical, Old English, African, and others). The book presented to English-language readers studies of oral heroic poetry collected in the Balkans in the twentieth century, analyzed their technique, and compared them in detail to the Homeric poems, and, to a lesser extent, medieval European works with similar traits. Homer's repeated phrases and verses were shown to be explainable as a technical device to assist the rapid composition of poems as they were recited, not a sign of scribal corruption or sloppy editing of independent short songs. The comparisons were not new - French scholars had called attention to the nineteenth-century collections of Balkan heroic songs -- but were presented in a coherent and even attractive package, and included additional material from Lord's own fieldwork.    The heart of the book, however, was the work of Lord's teacher, Milman Parry, who had died in 1935 leaving a seven-page draft of his projected synthesis. Parry's works had not had a great reception from English and American classicists (a major study was then available only in French), but the basic ideas had filtered into classical studies in an unsystematic way.

It reprints the existing text unchanged, but includes a useful new introduction, describing the history and reception of the work, with extensive bibliography. It also includes a CD with reproductions of the original audio recordings of the sections of songs quoted in the text; those with the right PC or Mac hardware and software can also access visual material, including a short filmstrip of one of the traditional singers, and other interesting extras.

Lord's \\"Singer of Tales\\" was published in 1960, as Number 24 of the \\"Harvard Studies in Comparative Literature,\\" and was picked up in paperback by Atheneum only a few years later (1965). It is probably the most widely read book in the monograph series, and the most controversial. It is certainly the best known of its author's books and articles.    Over the course of four decades and a variety of reprintings, \\"The Singer of Tales\\" has established itself as a fundamental work in the study of oral literatures, and literatures which appear to have emerged from oral traditions (Biblical, Old English, and others). The book presented to English-language readers studies of oral heroic poetry collected in the Balkans in the twentieth century, analyzed their technique, and compared them in detail to the Homeric poems, and, to a lesser extent, medieval European works with similar traits. Homer's repeated phrases and verses were shown to be explainable as a technical device to assist the rapid composition of poems as they were recited, not a sign of scribal corruption or sloppy editing of independent short songs. The comparisons were not new, but were presented in a coherent and even attractive package, and included additional material from Lord's own fieldwork.    The heart of the book, however, was the work of Lord's teacher, Milman Parry, who had died in 1935 leaving a seven-page draft of his projected synthesis. Parry's works had not a great reception from English and American classicists (a major study was published in French), but the basic ideas had filtered into classical studies in an unsystematic way. In \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" (1942) C.S. Lewis even formulated an \\"audience-theory\\" variant of \\"oral formulaic composition,\\" explaining how it helped listeners as well as reciters. With Lord's presentation, however, a fairly esoteric theory became a part of the intellectual world of literary scholarship.    A Second Edition of \\"The Singer of Tales\\" appearedin 2000. Serious students of Classical, Medieval, and several other literatures who do not already own a copy, and want (or need) one, will probably buy this edition; it is what is readily available. It reprints Lord's text without change (and rather more clearly than some copies I have seen!), so identifying references in early discussions of the book will not be a problem.    What about those of us who have a copy, or have just read the book several times? Is the Second Edition worth our time and money?    The differences from the first edition and its various reprintings are two.    First, there is an \\"Introduction to the Second Edition\\" by Stephen Mitchell and Gregory Nagy, distinguished scholars of Germanic and Greek literature (respectively). It surveys the history of the book, its reception, a variety of responses, and the development of Lord's thoughts on the issues it raises, and concludes with a six-page bibliography (in rather small print). The coverage is pro-Lord (not unexpectedly), but so far as I can see includes the most impressive of his critics. This is useful, and the execution is excellent, but the needs of the student can probably be met by consulting it in a library. Inevitably, as a review of current scholarship, it will be dated more quickly than the rest of the book.    Second, the volume comes with an Audio and Video CD. This contains actual recordings, made in the field by Parry or Lord, of Serbian traditional singers. The audio tracks are accessible on a CD player (or DVD player). For those with an appropriately powerful PC or Mac, it is possible to see the texts and translations as the singer performs. The passages chosen are those given in the text of the book, and are a minute fraction of the audio archive and published transcripts, but they bring the descriptions to life. The sound quality is that of the actual recordings, and has not been \\"cleaned up\\" or otherwise enhanced. For those with the right software, it is also possible to see an actual short film of a traditional singer performing, and Bela Bartok's attempts to transcribe some of the music. Assuming that changing technologies (see below) do not make it inaccessible, this should retain its value indefinitely.    (Or until the entire archive, with transcriptions and translations, miraculously shows up on DVD. Meanwhile, a substantial selection of material from the Milman Parry and Albert B. Lord collections, including more Bartok manuscripts and his public letter on the value of the collection, a collection of photographs, and the filmstrip, has been made available online by Harvard University, on a site dedicated to Oral Literature Studies and the Milman Parry Collection; additional material is promised.)    So, if it fits your budget (and the price is quite reasonable, despite my sticker-shock when I remember what I had paid for a copy in 1968), go ahead; just make sure that you are getting the second edition, with CD, not a copy of the first edition.    Note: On the Macintosh side, I have run the CD successfully on an early PowerMac using System 7.5.5, although the \\"film strip\\" (which needs a slightly later version of QuickTime) was, predictably, not accessible; completely successfully on a G3 under System 9.2; and again, on a G4 with System 10.2.7 (and later 10.2.8), which needed to open the \\"Classic\\" System 9 emulator to display the visual material. The \\"Classic\\" mode is supposed to be phased out over time, so problems of obsolence may already be closing in. A report on Windows issues would be useful.	2003-10-05

His translation is quite pleasant reading. Unfortunately, the problems begin as soon as the reader tries to understand Ficino, instead of Boer. The \\"Three Books of Life\\" contain a mixture of medicine, astrology, neo-Platonic philosophy, and more or less concealed magic, and Boer makes little effort to explain any of these; it is not clear how much of any of them he recognized in the text he was translating.<br /><br />To anyone familiar with the discussions of the book in, for example, Walker's \\"Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Ficino to Campanella,\\" or Yates' \\"Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition,\\" the translation could only be a source of frustration.<br /><br />Basically, there seem to have been two sets of problems. First, the translation was based on unreliable versions of the Latin. The lack of a proper edition was not Boer's fault; professional scholars of Renaissance Latin writings (Humanist Latin is a subject in itself) had never published one. But it should have made him very cautious about trying to puzzle it out for himself. Second, Boer seems to have paid little, if any, attention to the vast scholarship needed to understand Ficino, which was available, if somewhat scattered through books and journals.<br /><br />Since Boer was dismissive of the existing Ficino scholarship, hostile reviews from scorned specialists were perhaps to be expected. But I am not one of them, and I can testify from experience that Boer's work was more frustrating than useful.<br /><br />Fortunately, not too long after the appearance of Boer's version, Carole V. Kaske and John R. Clark's \\"Three Books on Life\\" was announced for publication. It has since appeared, and, with several reprintings behind it, is, at this writing, available. It has a full edition of the Latin text facing the translation, an excellent introduction, and elaborate notes and index / glossaries. It is not as fun to read as Boer sometimes is, but, despite the slightly higher price, it is a better bargain. You get useful historical contexts, advice on whether Ficino is making a pun, or is completely serious, even alternative explanations -- all the things I wondered about when trying to read Boer's version.rate notes and index / glossaries.

He didn't. He added the intriguing observation that, since astrology was an integral part of medical practice, most important people in the later Middle Ages had access to a private astrologer in the form of a physician. I have sometimes wished that I had the training to properly follow up on that observation.<br /><br />The book exploring the topic of physicians as court astrologers may remain to be written (a lot of useful material is in John D. North's \\"Horoscopes and History,\\" published in the Warburg Institute's Surveys and Texts series in 1986, and I may well have missed later work in the area). Smoller's \\"History, Prophecy, and the Stars\\" comes close to what I had in mind when I asked the question about astrology and politics. It deals with Pierre D'Ailly, Chancellor of the University of Paris  (and a Cardinal from 1411 until his death in 1420), who turned to astrology relatively late in his career.<br /><br />The politics Smoller deals with were ecclesiastical, but many of the implications and consequences were entirely secular. The turning of some leaders of the Catholic Church to the stars for hope (or confirmation of their fears) during a \\"Great Schism\\" is readily understandable, since the authority, and identity, of the Pope were the main issues in a prolonged crisis. Those of us familiar with the episode from either secular or Church history will find here an interesting sidelight on the struggle for authority as an issue of faith. (For those who aren't so familiar; very briefly, the effort to end the \\"Babylonian Captivity\\" of the Papacy in Avignon [1309-1378] produced the election of too many Popes, in and out of Rome, all with more or less important secular backers, and withdifferent implications for the nature  of the Papacy and papal authority. The dispute was finally settled at the Council of Constance in 1414.)<br /><br />Some of Smoller's book is not easy reading, combining as it does Ptolemaic astronomy, medieval mathematics, and the more abstruse forms of \\"judicial astrology.\\" Fortunately, Smoller rarely lets the reader lose sight of the apparently imminent collapse of the Papacy, regarded as the sign of the arrival of the Antichrist, and the Last Judgment. Those most interested in the details of the astrological theories and practice will find much tucked away in the notes, where they do not get in the way of those reading for history, or a rare example of a fairly detailed intellectual biography of a prelate (Pierre D'Ailly) who is not regarded an important theologian. He once had a higher standing; many of his works were issued by early printers, and important readers included Christopher Columbus -- and then, too, it was later noted by enemies of the French Revolution that he had concluded that the coming of the Antichrist had been postponed until 1789... .<br /><br />\\"History, Prophecy, and the Stars\\" deals with some very sophisticated developments of mathematical astrology. Those who still tend to describe everything between antiquity and modern times as \\"The Dark Ages\\" might try comparing it to Stephen C. McCluskey's lucid account of \\"Astronomies and Cultures in Early Modern Europe\\" (1998), which describes the calendrical calculations rules of thumb, and basic observations used in Western Europe up through the eleventh century. Sara J. Schechner's \\"Comets, Popular Culture, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology\\" (1997) offers a different perspective, as it takes responses to then-unpredictable celestial events into modern times. And, for a look at civilization with a radically different approach to omens in the sky, Edward H. Schafer's \\"Pacing the Void: T'ang Approaches to the Stars\\" (1977) is a highly regarded study of Chinese literature in the period of roughly 600 to 900 A.D., which recently (2005) has been reprinted.	2003-10-04

Although many of the examples it offers are debatable, and some of its positions have been repeatedly challenged, nothing quite like it exists, at least in English. It is a mine of odd data, and frequently fascinating.  Originally, however, it was a prize-winning &#34;Contribution to Classical studies.&#34; As a result of the competition rules, Greek and Latin passages are quoted without translation, unlike citations from Old Norse, Hebrew, Chinese, etc. Access to a good library containing translations of Homer, Hesiod, the Greek tragedians, Plato, and Aristotle, would be extremely helpful for almost anyone using the book. Fortunately, most of the important passages now are available on-line.  Onians' book had an impact on several important British classical scholars while still in draft or galley-proof form in the late 1930s and 1940s, and was cited under earlier working titles. It was finally published in 1951, after many delays, some due to the author, some, including a World War, out of his hands. During this time the original book accumulated massive appendices as supplements to the already type-set main text.  As a fairly expensive hardcover, the book seems to have been cited and consulted more often than absorbed, and it is a pity that it took until 1988 for it to appear as a more reasonably priced paperback. Having had to compete for a reserve copy, I snatched it up as soon as I saw it was in paperback, and I could monopolize it with a clean conscience.  It is still too long and too complicated to for me to imagine it being assigned as an undergraduate textbook, and I would not suggest it as light reading. However, anyone with a serious interest in how modern European-based cultures came to think as they do about the very nature of ourselves and the world we experience should try to take a long look at it. If you are using a library that doesn't have it, suggest it. If you can find a copy, check it over. You may, like me, find that you want it for yourself.  Note: Since this review was originally submitted, the thumbnail of the cover displayed on Amazon has changed from the original blue paperback cover, with a somewhat, and appropriately, enigmatic figurine, to an equally appropriate, and much more &#34;classical,&#34; image, which happens to be quite beautiful. Anyone ordering a used copy therefore may find that it looks disappointingly different.	2003-10-04

Melville's translation of the \\"Thebaid\\" is a worthwhile addition to the Oxford University Press'  \\"World's Classics\\" series (now appearing as \\"Oxford World's Classics\\"). The Roman poet Statius has suffered in modern estimation for not being Virgil, and classical, or Ovid, and romantic. In addition, his story overlapped with a version by Aeschylus (\\"The Seven Against Thebes\\") and Sophocles' three surviving Theban plays, so in the Greeks versus Romans playoffs, the Latin poet was pitted against two geniuses in a different genre.<br /><br />To the Middle Ages, though, Statius was one of the great poets, with adaptations and sequels in vernacular languages. Readers may be familiar with, for example, Chaucer's \\"Knight's Tale,\\" which assumes the Theban war as a background event. There have been only a handful of translations into modern English, however, and only the uninspiring English in the Loeb Classical Library bilingual version has been very readily available. (I tend to be a little wary of Melville's dismissals of the competition in his other translations, but once having forced myself through part of the 1928 Loeb edition then available, I have to agree in this case.)<br /><br />[It should be added that a NEW Loeb edition of Statius, edited and translated by D. R. Shackleton Bailey, is now available, and is NOT included in this observation. Paolo Asso has treated this two-volume publication (which includes the fragment of an Achilles epic) in the on-line \\"Bryn Mawr Classical Review\\" -- which, as of November 8, 2004, has just issued a \\"correct version of BMCR 2004.11.02, Loeb Statius. Thebaid,\\" replacing an accidental repeat of his review of Bailey's edition of Statius' lyrics, the \\"Silvae\\". Asso -- to whom I am indebted for the elegant descripton of Statius as writing Greek poetry in Latin -- has serious concerns with Bailey's treatment of the Latin text. But he finds the translation, taken with its annotations, readable.]<br /><br />From his early (\\"Allegory of Love\\") to his latest (\\"Discarded Image\\") medieval studies, C.S. Lewis was a great champion of Statius, pointing out how congenial and helpful his materialist (astrological) and allegorical (psychological) treatment of the pagan gods was to medieval Christian readers and writers. His approach suggested that \\"un-classical\\" aspects of the poem should be seen as something new and different, not a failure to be Homeric or Virgilian. Melville's translation seems to have stimulated a similar appreciation in \\"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\\" (Clute and Grant), which gives Statius an article in which he is treated as one of the precursors of modern fantasy.<br /><br />Statius presents the Theban War more as a catalogue of horrors than an heroic romp, and if treated as modern fantasy the epic would mainly fall on the \\"Dark Fantasy\\" side. Moorcock's Elric would be more at home in Statius' version of Greece before the Trojan War than would Tolkien's Aragorn  -- although some of the characters in \\"The Silmarillion\\" might find it all depressingly familiar. It is not light reading, but I agree that it is a great poem, neglected far too long.<br /><br />Addendum: There is a new translation by Charles Stanley Ross, \\"The Thebaid: Seven Against Thebes,\\" from Johns Hopkins University Press, announced for December 2004 (not seen).	2003-10-02

Caldwell -- just in case, as sometimes happens, it appears with a different translation. For those who are not familiar with it already, this is an account, in Homeric verse, of how the organized universe arose, expressed through generations of gods, their struggles for supremacy, and the culminating triumph of Zeus, with the great Olympians and a multitude of nature-deities listed along the way. Told in noble hexameters, it is an extremely violent story, full of abusive parents, mutilations inflicted by rebellious offspring, divine cannibalism, and a whole succession of other behaviors the Greeks themselves considered repellent. The philosophers had real problems with this work -- one can understand why Plato wanted to ban poets from the ideal state.<br /><br />As it happens, I own most (but not quite all) of the currently or recently available English translations: those by Apostolos N. Athanassakis, Norman O. Brown, Hugh G. Evelyn-White (bilingual edition, Loeb Classical Library), R.M. Frazer, Richmond Lattimore, Dorothea Wender (Penguin Classics), and M. L. West (Oxford World's Classics). Except for Brown, who also covers only the &#34;Theogony,&#34; they all contain at least the other main Hesiodic poem, &#34;Works and Days&#34; as a companion piece. West is also the editor of a Greek text, with extensive commentary. In this crowded field, in which the renderings of Athanassakis and Lattimore are notable for the quality of their poetry, Caldwell stakes a claim to utility.<br /><br />The introduction contains numerous tables, displaying the relationships of various sets of gods, nymphs, monsters, and others, His translation is set out in verse lines, with running numbers at intervals of five, which makes locating references extremely easy. (No headnotes identifying thirty or fifty-line blocks of material!) An essay on the &#34;Psychology of the Succession Myth&#34; (rather simplistically Freudian, but interesting) is followed by a translation of some the most important related material from &#34;Works and Days,&#34; and (hurray) parallel passages from a late prose compendium of Greek mythology, the Bibliotheke of Apollodoros (better known as the &#34;Library of Apollodorus&#34;). He has a useful (if now slightly dated) discussion of the main Near Eastern parallels. (Brown also discusses the comparative and psychological aspects of the poem, from different perspectives; his psychological treatment seems to me subtler, and more closely related to the political reading he offers.)

Most useful of all, however, are the running annotations. They range from the most elementary (assuming no prior knowledge of Greek myth or literature) to impressively advanced (issues of structure, technique, and deeper meanings).

Given Caldwell's attention to detail, if you are a novice in the field who doesn't plan to build up even a small collection, but is willing to read a single volume with close attention, this might be your best choice. Those who already know the subject are likely to find it attractive, although sorting through such basic reminders as \\"Zephyros is the west wind, Boreas the north wind\\" in search of interpretive insights can be a test of patience.	2003-10-01

Lives of Homer (Loeb Classical Library No. 496)	Books	5	37	37	N	Y	Ian Myles Slater on A Welcome Expansion	Back in 1914, the Loeb Classical Library issued, as volume 57 of the series, \\"Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns and Homerica,\\" edited and translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White. A revised and expanded edition of 1920 included a substantial appendix of newly published fragments from Greek papyri; this appendix received a further supplement in 1936, edited and translated by D.L. Page. The volume was reprinted at intervals thereafter (my copy is from 1967), but without updating.    Now Martin L. West, already known for his editions and translations of Hesiod and the early lyric poets, not to mention a recent edtion of the \\"Iliad,\\" has re-edited and re-translated part of the material as a new Loeb volume, \\"Homeric Hymns, Homeric Apocrypha, Lives of Homer.\\"  He offers it as the first part of a three-volume replacement for the Evelyn-White edition.    Although modern text editions (with very nice ZephGreek type) and better translations are welcome, one's first response is a grimace at buying three new books to replace a single old one. A closer look shows that this is really a good idea after all.    The Homeric Hymns (to the major Olympians, and some minor gods, in Homeric hexameters) are presented with superior textual readings, incorporating almost a century of additional research, and some of West's own suggestions. The prose translations are far easier going than their predecessor in the old Loeb editon, without being excessively colloquial. [I have now discussed the Hymns in more detail in reviews of three translations, by Athanassakis, Cashford, and Rayor.]     To the standard comic \\"Apocrypha,\\" the poems \\"Margites\\" (references and fragments on the adventures of a fool, a sort of anti-Odyssey), \\"Cercopes\\" (ape-like opponents of Herakles, references only), and \\"The Battle of the Frogs and Mice\\" (references and fragments; a mock-Iliad) are added references and possible quotations for \\"Epikichlides\\" (a mock-erotic piece), and \\"The Battle of the Weasel and the Mice.\\" This last isa fragment from papyri, first published in 1983; although nowhere attributed to Homer, it, or something very like, is clearly alluded to in the \\"canonical\\" \\"Frogs and Mice.\\"    Then comes the big change, concentrated in the final section. A modern edition of the story of \\"The Contest of Homer and Hesiod\\" is supplemented by important additions not found in Evelyn-White's volume. In place of his collection of pseudo-Homeric \\"Epigrams,\\" we get them in their literary context, the \\"On Homer's Origins, Date, and Life,\\" which tries to pass itself off as a work by Herodotus. This survey of traditions and fictions is followed by the other ancient \\"Lives\\" of Homer, including the excerpts and summaries found in medieval Greek writers. These works, often alluded to, have not been available in English before (and in fact most have not been all that easy to find in Greek, either). Some of them are amusing, and all illustrate that the genre of \\"celebrity biography\\" is very old, and has never let a lack of facts get in the way.    Finally, there are two indexes, one to the Hymns and Apocrypha, the other to \\"Lives\\".    Similar expansions are promised for the Hesiodic material (Theogony, Works and Days, Shield of Herakles, and numerous fragments) [still forthcoming], and the summaries and fragments of the Epic Cycle (the other stories of the Trojan War, and the Wars with Thebes) [now published]. Despite the expense, I look forward to them.    [Note: taking another look at this review, I find that I either omitted, or at some point deleted, mention of the interesting treatment of the volume by R. Scott Garner, in the on-line \\"Bryn Mawr Classical Review\\" (written and edited by professional classicists, although the contents are -- mostly -- intended to be accessible to serious lay readers.) Garner raises a number of specific objections, but concludes that \\"on the whole this is a volume that is quite worthy of one of the top individuals working in the field today and a welcome additionto the Loeb Classical Library in general.\\"]	2003-10-01

It seems to have provided the model for the later Vulgate Cycle, which includes \\"Lancelot\\" and \\"The Quest of the Holy Grail,\\" and its successors, including Thomas Malory''s \\"Le Morte D'Arthur.\\" Obviously, everyone seriously interested in Arthurian literature will have read it. Wrong. Very wrong.<br /><br />To begin with, there is, unfortunately, direct manuscript evidence for only \\"Joseph of Arimathea\\" (the early history of the Grail) and the opening of \\"Merlin\\" in verse. What we have for the whole cycle, concluding with \\"Perceval\\" (the Grail Quest), and \\"The Death of Arthur\\" (as either the conclusion of \\"Perceval\\" or a short continuation of the cycle), is a prose redaction. The relationship of this to the work of the original poet in its later portions is uncertain -- assuming that there was a complete version in verse.<br /><br />The prose retelling exists in a variety of manuscripts, only two of which (known as Modena and Didot, the latter famous but textually corrupt) contain the whole collection, and they otherwise differ among themselves. There have been a number of editions of the medieval French texts, based on different manuscripts and editorial principles, so even those with a good reading knowledge of Old French have not necessarily read the same book.<br /><br />For those of us who read only English (at least with any fluency), there has been only the last section, as \\"The Romance of Perceval in Prose: A Translation of the E Manuscript of the Didot Perceval\\" by Dell Skeels, published by University of Washington Press in 1961. It was once available in paperback (1966 printing), but is long out of print. Fortunately Skeels resisted the turn-of-the-century models of Sebastian Evans and W.W. Comfort, and turned out workman-like modern English instead of pseudo-Malory. Unfortunately, he provided only half the story (the Quest and the Death of Arthur), and the information provided about the material was limited.<br /><br />Now Nigel Bryant has come riding to the rescue of beleaguered amateur Arthurians and besieged students (sorry, I can't resist the image) with another of his modern language translations.

US	30081986	R2LB69SLR0TEFR	1568219741	599451742	The Structure of the Siddur	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on A Modern Vision of a Traditional Text	In this volume, Stephen Schach, an authority on software engineering, set out to clarify the arrangement of the standard Jewish service. Was this necessary? Absolutely.     The Siddur, or \\"Order,\\" is the conventional name for the standard Jewish prayerbook, used for weekdays and Sabbaths, and usually including variations for some of the festivals, and is conventionally distinguished from the Machzor, the High Holy Day (New Year and Day of Atonement) liturgies. (The distinction is fairly modern, and medieval manuscripts sometimes reverse the usage -- which is important for those first looking into sources and documentation, since, for example, \\"Machzor Vitry\\" may be cited for the daily or Sabbath service. I mention this because, unfortunately, some standard reference works, including the recent \\"Oxford Dictionary of World Religions,\\" don't explain the point.)    To most of its users, including observant Jews who could, if necessary, recite it by heart (before printing, a very widespead practice), the arrangement of texts is a given. The more studious, whether observant or not, are aware of disputes about the inclusion or exclusion of passages, their order, and when they are used. Those who have studied the history of the liturgy are aware of the differing ages of adjacent sections. Judging from the way explanations often turn into catalogues (as in Idelsohn's fine old \\"Jewish Liturgy and Its Development,\\" still worth consulting despite its age and limitations), very few could actually outline the principals of the arrangement of the \\"Order of Prayer.\\"     Stephen Schach addresses himself to the reader who is either deeply familiar with the Synagogue Service, or who has at hand a text of the traditional (\\"Orthodox\\") Ashkenazic (Central and Eastern European) Siddur. (There are several readily available, with facing translation and commentaries both technical and homiletic.) His comments on the meanings and spiritual messages of the prayers, hymns, and biblical and rabbinic passages are sparse. Everything is focussed on revealing how they are put together, and what the resulting patterns, and exceptions to the patterns, mean. He does so with marvelously clear charts -- the sort of thing computers have made routine in publishing, but actually done with intelligence as well an eye for graphic design. He reveals an underlying structure, and by doing so makes the variations significant.    So it was necessary, and it was well done. Is it what everyone curious about Judaism, or looking for religious edification, will want to read? No -- but anyone who is seriously interested in traditional Jewish religious practice is likely to find it interesting, and may find it enlightening, It should also be of considerable interest to Jews familiar only with the Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist liturgies, which have variously abbreviated, re-ordered, and otherwise innovated upon this underlying set of patterns.    The author has since fufilled his promise to devote a volume to the much more complex High Holy Day liturgies -- but that is another book, and should have its own review.	2003-09-29
US	30081986	RTKESLL95F6UI	0520027132	566246585	Archery at the Dark of the Moon: Poetic Problems in Homer's Odyssey	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on: On Intriguing Look at Odysseus	The bibliography of Homeric studies is almost inconceivably vast (there are acute comments by contemporaries of Socrates), and I can't claim to have read more than a small fraction of even the major works in English. However, I once made an effort to find, and read, the most famous and / or frequently cited works.  At about the same time this work first appeared, to generally excellent reviews, and I added it to my &#34;must read&#34; list as soon as it arrived in the UCLA library. Although I found that I disagreed with, for example, some of his views on the oral-formulaic theory of composition, the argument was well-expressed. I kept on reading. The previous reading of major critics turned out to be helpful in understanding Austin's book, which itself proved exceptionally illuminating for my next re-reading of Homer -- not always the case, unfortunately.  &#34;Archery at the Dark of the Moon&#34; is in part a close reading of the Odyssey, in part a sustained argument over theories of reading and interpretation. As I have suggested, it is probably not a good place for someone to start. For those with some background, in both Homeric issues and critical theory, it will be rewarding reading.  Don't ask me to sort out exactly how it changed my views of an already familiar text, not at this date. When I re-read Austin in paperback in the mid-1990s, I was surprised at how familiar it still seemed; I had assimilated that much. For me, that marks it as an extremely impressive book.  The first chapter, for example, despite my reservations, has some acute observations about the &#34;fixed epithets&#34; attached to Odysseus, and how their appearance is governed by more than metrical considerations. He shows that almost all of the sixty-odd uses of &#34;polymetis&#34; -- usually translated as something like &#34;of many plans&#34; -- appear when the hero is about to cajole, convince, or trick someone. He suggests that &#34;thinking hard, he said&#34; might be a better rendering. In any case, this hero is being described in ways more meaningful than his ships, which, as is well known, are &#34;black&#34; or &#34;hollow&#34; in accordance with the space to be filled in the line, not their appearance or cargo capacity.  On larger issues, too, such as the working of the story, Austin has much to say that is worth attention. I doubt that there will ever be a generally convincing explanation of the (rather bizarre) archery contest that forms the climax of the epic (and provides his title), but Austin is at least interesting as a critic of the story, without needing to propose unusual axe-shapes and odd modifications of the laws of physics to justify the text.  This really ought to be back in print.	2003-09-26

Wasson argues that the cryptic descriptions of the Soma can be explained by the shape and colors of the mushroom, while its effects explain its association with divine powers, and its use in the sacrificial rituals to contact the gods. The conclusion has been widely accepted, and bitterly disputed, with a number of opponents returning, armed with new information, to earlier proposals.    The earlier views are the subject of a substantial section of this thick volume, a survey of the nineteenth and twentieth century literature by Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, who is now writing as Wendy Doniger. In later writings, Doniger has supported more strongly Wasson's conclusion that Soma was originally a fungus, although admitting to some uncertainty as to which fungus, and to whether the sacred species might have shifted with time and availability. This survey is in itself a useful reference, and Doniger's translations of the some of the Rig-Veda Soma Hymns in her selection from \\"The Rig-Veda\\" for the Penguin Classics is a helpful companion as well.    (For the full set of such hymns, I know of only one English version, R.T.H. Griffith's aging complete translation of the Rig Veda -- second edition 1896 -- which, among other problems, accepted Max Mueller's identification of Soma with the Ephedra plant. The theory would make more sense if the species Mueller named was in fact the pharmacologically active Ma Huang variety, instead of just a relative.)    The whole issue is confused by difficulty of disentangling references to Soma as a ritual substance used in offerings to the Devas (the gods), as a substance the control of which was disputed by the Devas and their rivals the Asuras (roughly Titans, relatives and, mostly, enemies of the gods), and as agod itself, sometimes identical with the Moon. As such it forms a parallel to Agni, the fire-god, which is sometimes the actual sacrificial fire, sometimes an abstraction of it, and sometimes a deity with its own myths and cult.    Anyone interested in the subject of \\"entheogens\\" (a term coined after the appearance of Wasson's study, and in part as a response to it) should definitely read this book carefully, not least because it is so frequently quoted, quoted out of context, misquoted, and misrepresented -- and I am only talking about those who claim to agree with it.    So far as I am aware, there is still room for a major study, by someone other than an declared opponent of Wasson's thesis, of how closely the older Iranian material on \\"Haoma\\" (the expected, and documented, equivalent of the Sanskrit name) does or does not parallel the Vedic texts. It is possible, at least in theory, that more than one plant served the function, and received the name, in the period of Indo-Iranian linguistic unity. (The on-line \\"Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies\\" offered a series of articles on aspects of the problem in 2002-2003, which are available in pdf format; some fairly technical, but with up-to-date bibliograpy.)    I would add that while I sympathize with Wasson's endorsement of orthodox Hindu hostility toward alcohol, which already appears in the Vedic texts, it seems quite clear that fermented drinks also filled the ideological role of Soma in other Indo-European cultures. For example, a serious modern comparison of the Indra's theft or recovery of Soma from the Asuras, with the aid of, or in the shape of, an eagle, to Odin's theft of the Mead of Poetry from the Giants, in the form of an eagle, is greatly to be desired. Especially if it is undertaken by a scholar with a full command of the diverse versions of the myth in Indian literature, and an open approach to modern theories of mythic narrative.	2003-09-25

Her own fiction is less well known, which is is a shame, since this novel displays both a fine command of narrative and characterization and an impressive amount of background research.  Potential readers should be aware that an earlier form of the book appeared as &#34;Dreamrider&#34; (which I have also reviewed under its Amazon listing, suggesting some additional reading to the curious). I would urge anyone who read and liked that version of the novel, and missed this edition, not to pass up the revised and expanded form, which is significantly richer, and even more satisfying.  If you have not read &#34;Dreamrider,&#34; both versions are heady mixtures of science fiction (future and alternate histories, technological and medical advances) and the mystical powers and out-of-body journeys of ritual specialists in many cultures. The heroine is based in a dystopian future that may or may not be ours, but much of the action takes place in time in which humans share the world with other intelligent species, including some playful, delightful, and realistically predatory, otters.  This book has been one of my favorites for years, and it is a pity that it is out of print; I am glad to see that used copies are circulating, so at least a few more people will get to enjoy it.	2003-09-25

Both versions are worth reading, but &quot;Shaman,&quot; which unfortunately is also out of print, is probably the more satisfactory, if available.<br />Some of those who have read the book in either form may not have recognized that the &quot;classic text&quot; read by the protagonist, Mircea Eliade's &quot;Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy,&quot; is a real book. It is worth reading in its own right (and at places amounts to a technical commentary on the novel, like Hal Clement's essays on the factual content of his science fiction novels), but it is not nearly as a much fun.	2003-09-24

It is told by naval aviators, part of the group which proposed using themselves and their aircrcraft as anti-ship weapons, instead of continuing increasingly futile efforts to use bombs and torpedoes. It was originally published in English by the Naval Institute Press in 1958, and should be credited in part to Roger Pineau (as in the Amazon listings for some editions). It was quickly reprinted in paperback by Bantam Books (1960), and reprinted several times in that format (Amazon lists a 1985 reissue, clearly crediting Pineau). It has been in and out of print thereafter.    It is not only a source-document for military history, containing the recollections of surviving participants in the \\"Divine Wind\\" campaign, but has material of profound psychological and even philosophical interest. The (late) Princeton philosopher Walter Kaufmann called particular attention to the collection of letters from young pilots who had volunteered for the mission of dying in the hope of striking the enemy. This final chapter (followed by statistical appendices on sorties) is, to my (inexpert) knowledge, the largest single group of such documents available in English. [Note, January 2015: It turns out that a collection of such letters appeared several years after I wrote this review; \\"Kamikaze Diaries: Reflections of Japanese Student Soldiers\\" edited by Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney (2006).]    There are also some fascinating reflections from volunteers who survived the war, and faced a difficult adjustment not only to defeat and peace, but to life.     There are now available more detailed accounts of the main Kamikaze effort. (Which was, by the way more properly called, in formal Sino-Japanese, \\"Shimpu\\" -- the term familiar to Westerners apparently was worked up by code-breakers using dictionaries, and they missed the actual written and spoken forms). Here we have an outline, from the point when Admiral Ohnishi expressed to some senior pilots his admiration of those who had \\"body-rammed\\" enemy bombers with their fighter planes, and they responded by looking for even more profitable targets, to Ohnishi's own suicide. (A traditional formal one, in response to Japan's surrender. Some other senior promoters of the tactic were blocked from getting airborne on their own \\"final missions,\\" and at least one led a suicide sortie that apparently ran out fuel.)    There have also been studies of the related suicide weapons developed by the Japanese armed forces (the \\"Okha\\" manned rocket bombs and \\"Kaiten\\" manned torpedoes), in part in response to the improvised attack planes used in the Philippines, as described here, in part from similar but independent roots. \\"The Divine Wind\\" appears to minimize the participation of the Japanese Army in the attacks, possibly because the co-authors relied on their own recollections, backed up by naval records, instead of conducting a full study of all such operations.    Although some of these efforts caused tremendous suffering, it seems clear that the Japanese commanders never received accurate information on their successes and failures, and did not make much of an effort to find better tactics for a concept which some felt had been imposed upon them by junior officers. (Note that Ohnishi initially had to act rather obliquely.) That struggle to change the official tactical doctrine to one more in line with the prevailing political ideology (and the actual practices it suggested) is in fact one of the points raised by the account from Rikihei Inoguchi and Tadashi Nakajima. Later studies have argued that the pressure to adopt the tactic came from several sources, and that the authors have inflated Ohnishi's role (and their own), although, again, their reporting of what they themselves witnessed and did is not necessarily in question.    Material, tactical and strategic issues, however, are not the main concern of \\"Divine Wind\\" -- it is the story of the naval pilots, veterans and raw recruits, from as close to their experience as it is possible to reach.	2003-09-23
US	30081986	R1TILCUKO3YWGX	0691098271	425347027	Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (Bollingen Series (General))	Books	5	98	101	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on Fifty Years and Still Going Strong	I agree whole-heartedly with the many earlier reviewers who have praised this extraordinary book. However, it has given rise to some controversies, and prospective purchasers might as well be aware of them. Given the richness of the volume, I consider them minor, but a chorus of praise invites disappointment.  First of all, the original French edition was in 1951 (and was one of the author's post-war works apparently not written in his native Romanian). The revised and updated English translation (the fine work of Willard Trask) first appeared in the Bollingen series in 1964. Princeton University Press issued the Bollingen edition in paperback in 1972, and this appears to be the version currently in print. Hence, it is, obviously, more than a little out of date bibliographically. Some people are troubled by this, but there is no way the book could have been expanded to deal with the explosion of research and publications which followed its appearance (although about two hundred titles, mainly post-1948, were added to the 1964 bibliography and notes). Just be aware that it may not mention something important.  [Since this review was originally posted, the MYTHOS edition for which it was written has been replaced by a new Princeton printing (January 2004), with a preface by Wendy Doniger, describing the book's importance and limitations with clarity and considerable authority. (She is the Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago.)]  Also because of the book's age, Eliade still used terms and ideas which were common in European scholarship in the first half of the century, but have been largely abandoned since, and in some cases never made much of an impression on the English-speaking scholarly world. He takes for granted the ancient Babylonian origin of several ideas about the cosmos, some of which the &#34;Pan-Babylonian&#34; school seems to have been reading into ancient texts. This has some importance for his attempts to trace the diffusion and relative ages of certain ideas. He also uses (and doesn't really define) cultural descriptions like &#34;Palaeo-Arctic&#34; which originated in anthropological theories current in the 1920s. This is where the age of the book really is important to keep in mind.  Of more importance are some of his working assumptions about the nature of Shamanism. Correctly observing that the word entered western European languages from Russian, which had borrowed it from Siberian tribes, he tends to regard the reindeer-herders of the Eurasian sub-Arctic as the model of &#34;true&#34; shamanism, in relation to which other, similar, phenomena, are to be classed. This is reasonable, but, as he sometimes suggests, the Siberian forms have a complex history of their own, and cannot be taken as primitive. It should also be kept in mind than the assumption that reindeer herding was an early precursor of full domestication has been challenged. If it is a secondary imitation of southern pastoral systems, the pristinely archaic nature of the cultures based on it cannot be taken for granted, and their internal history is not independent either.  Because many Siberian forms involve elaborate physical (and sometimes verbal) gymnastics, culminating in a trance state, while others consist only in a trance state, often chemically induced, he treats the latter as secondary (and &#34;degenerate&#34;) offshoots. It is easier to see the difficult and complex form being simplified than it is to see a pure trance developing into a demanding theatrical display, but it is not demonstrable. However, Eliade did not intend it as a contribution to later debates over psychedelic drugs, even if it has been read as such. (Eliade doesn't help matters by citing as corroboration for his view the widespread claim that in the &#34;good old days&#34; shamans didn't just dance their flights to the otherworld, they were seen flying through the air!) A very different view is suggested Gordon Wasson's studies of  the Vedic Soma, which he relates to the use of fly agaric mushrooms as an intoxicant by the reindeer-herders Eliade invokes for the opposite purpose. In  I.M. Lewis' several studies of ecstatic religions he rather brusquely dismisses Eliade's position; one would have hoped for a fuller response.  [Additional Note, March 2015: My reference primarily was to I.M. Lewis’ “Ecstatic Religion,” as published by Penguin Books in 1971. I have only recently become aware of its second and third editions, published by Routledge in 1989 and 2003; the latter, at least, apparently covers Eliade and the other critical literature more thoroughly.]  Finally, Eliade treats out-of-body experiences (&#34;Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy&#34;) as definitive of shamanism, and spirit-possession as a side issue. However, possession experiences do seem to be central in several cultures which are commonly described as shamanist, and the distinction may be more important to Eliade's need to limit the material than to anything else.  I would also add that Eliade's copious material on shamanic initiation experiences bears a striking resemblance to some accounts of extra-terrestrial abductions and medical experiments. How did Fox Mulder miss this?	2003-09-23

Although historians of both Alchemy and Judaism have been in agreement that the Jewish role in the development and spread of alchemy was either non-existent or tiny, the alchemical texts themselves insist otherwise. The main lines of development have been traced from Hellenistic Egypt, through the Islamic world, and into Christian Europe, with little or no need for Jewish sources or transmitters, and most Jewish historians have been satisfied (or delighted) to agree.    Indeed, in influential writings on the psychological meanings of alchemical symbolism, C. G. Jung went so far as to reclassify the several Jewish alchemists cited and quoted in Alexandrian Greek documents as really Jewish Christians. (He had a theory that transmutation was a material metaphor for transubstantiation, which required a Christian origin before alchemy reached Islam.)    The late Raphael Patai amassed a huge amount of information, including alchemical manuscripts in Hebrew (translated with commentaries herein), and set about to consider the cases of supposed alchemists described as Jewish, and real alchemists supposed by someone to be Jewish, in detail. While many particular instances are unconvincing, the interplay he demonstrates between medicine and alchemy on the one hand, and alchemical and mystical circles on the other, does suggest that at least a minor theme in Jewish intellectual life has been ignored by modern scholarship.    The main problem with the book is that it really requires backgrounds in both Jewish and alchemical studies to follow and judge Patai's arguments. However, to be fair, it does not offer itself as a primer in either subject. You will have to look elsewhere, and there is ample bibliographic information.    A few examples of what it offers:    Harry Potter fans will here encounter the real Nicholas Flamel of Paris (a real man, if not necessarily really an alchemist), and his supposed Jewish source-book for the philosopher's stone. Patai does not seem to me to advance the argument much, but he does demonstrate that the legend is part of a larger body of material about Jewish books falling into Christian hands. He also has some useful comments on the obliviousness of English and European scholars to each other's writings on Flamel, and some deeply embedded errors of translation in English-language treatments.    Patai's argument for a genuine Hebrew original of the \\"autobiography\\" of the magician and alchemist \\"Abramelin\\" is interesting, but he manages to misrepresent Gershom Scholem's changes of mind on the subject. Scholem, in a note in \\"On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead\\" (German edition 1962, English translation 1991; pages 314-315, note 24 to \\"Tselem: The Concept of the Astral Body\\"), which Patai does not cite, explains that since first treating it as Jewish in 1925 he had found Renaissance Christian sources for the book's Jewish concepts and post-biblical Hebrew and Aramaic. However, it is worthwhile to have Patai's citations of the German version, in addition to that translated from French into English by MacGregor Mathers in 1898 (reprinted some years ago by Dover). (Also, some of A.E. Waite's reasons for rejecting the Jewish origin of the text, in his \\"Ceremonial Magic,\\" such as the paternal blessing of children and the concept of guardian angels, are actually minor evidences for it!)    There is an interesting, and to my mind inconclusive, reconsideration of some the works formerly attributed to the Christian mystic Ramon Lull (various spellings), and their possible Jewish background.    Working notes of actual alchemists, including a multi-lingual dictionary of instruments and materials which is valuable evidence of cross-cultural influences in several directions.    All in all, a useful book for anyone already familiar with basic works on the history of alchemy, or with an interest in Jewish studies, and a good addition to a library with at least basic collections in both these subjects.	2003-09-22
US	30081986	R3OJYILMR8L1SO	0913022411	374223954	British Edda	Books	1	10	24	N	N	Why Bother?	Let us be perfectly clear. If the term \\"crackpot\\" didn't exist when this book was first published, it would have provided a good excuse to coin it. Comparisons between a variety of mythologies, some obvious, some far-fetched, and some unintelligible, are mixed with some odd variants of racist theories of Nordic supremacy to re-write the history of the world -- or at least as much of the world as mattered to Waddell. Readers who try to sift out the racism will still be left with a great mass of \\"facts\\" which are really aren't, but which are so fascinating as to be hard to \\"un-learn.\\" The \\"amazing\\" similarities between some of the Vedic and Scandinavian gods, for example once were truly astonishing -- about a hundred years before Waddell wrote this book.    Re-releasing \\"The British Edda\\" with bold assertions that it offers the \\"real truth,\\" drawn from selected early reviews, reminds me of the nineteenth-century American newspaper editors who eagerly picked up and ran exciting but dubious stories -- but some of them carefully used the discreet heading of \\"Important, If True.\\"    If not for the affinities to Nazism, \\"The British Edda\\" might have amusement value; Robert E. Howard's essay on \\"The Hyborian Age\\" (the background of the Conan stories) seems almost modest in comparison. It is somewhat alarming, however,  to find people claiming to draw religious inspiration from it.    For those on a real spiritual quest, and wary of any of the established religions (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, or other), there are now available perfectly good translations of the real Edda, of real British (Celtic) literature, of real Sumerian and Babylonian texts, and so forth. There are even some solidly based syntheses of pre-Christian Northern European spirituality (by Alwyn and Brinley Rees, by H.R. Ellis Davidson, and others).	2003-09-21

Keeping it simple; Wendy Doniger used Wendy Doniger  O'Flaherty on her earlier books, and uses Wendy Doniger for books published after her divorce; a few older printings of some of them have \\"Wendy O'Flaherty\\" on them somewhere. Hence the variants, which can leave some works (like this one) in bibliographic purgatory. (To add to the possible confusion, she is now the \\"Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions\\" at the University of Chicago, and has reported receiving mail with interesting combinations of names.)     A re-issue by Penguin, listed by Amazon with the simpler title of \\"The Rig Veda,\\" and a new cover design and art, but no other changes, has appeared (September 2005) as by Wendy Doniger; I have offered a new version of this review with it, with some different emphases, and have also reviewed a Kessinger e-book of the old R.T.H. Griffiths \\"complete\\" translation. (Well, really complete, IF you can read Latin, and if you find an unlisted appendix -- Griffiths took some care not to offend Victorian sensibilities, and Kessinger was a little careless.)    Secondly, under any form of the names, Wendy Doniger is a distinguished interpreter and translator of Vedic and classical Sanskrit texts, and of Indian religions in general. Her books are often witty, and at times quite dense with detail. She fully appreciates the playfulness of many versions of Hindu stories of the gods. (\\"Play\\" being in fact an explicit theme in some of them.)    In this volume she presents a selection of very ancient poems, in quite readable translations, and backs them up with detailed interpretive and bibliographic notes. It is a first-rate introduction to a very difficult body of literature, which, like the Bible and the Koran, is held sacred by a very large number of people.    Unfortunately, like the Koran, the Vedas are traditionally memorized, recited, cited,and sometimes explained, but not translated. Turning the mystical sounds of Sanskrit into readily intelligible words seems to strike some as sacrilege. At best, devotional readings are the only acceptable renderings. To the apparent distress of some true believers, Wendy Doniger tries to reconstruct what the poems meant when they were first recited (mainly, but not exclusively, to accompany rituals). This is not their meaning to present-day Hindus, over three thousand years later. (Which would be an interesting topic in itself.) This is exactly what critical scholarship is supposed to be about. Anyone who finds in it a specific bias against Hinduism might take a close look at an issue of, say, \\"The Journal of Biblical Literature\\" before complaining. This is what Christians and Jews having been doing with their own sacred texts for a couple of hundred years (actually, although sporadically, rather longer).    The main problem with the volume, as the translator would probably acknowledge, is that it will leave the reader hungry for more. There are only 108 (a sacred number) out of a canon of 1,028. She chose some of the most attractive poems, including most of the famous ones, presented them in language free of late-Victorian pseudo-Biblical idiom. Unfortunately, most of the other English versions, and all of the complete ones, belong to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and readers without Sanskrit, like me, can neither rely upon them nor easily find corrections for specific passages, so anything that isn't included is likely to be missed by someone.    I *have* compared her versions of a number of famous hymns to earlier English translations, to relatively recent treatments of passages in academic journals, and to transliterated Sanskrit texts (and also citations and variants outside the Rig Veda, traced in the digital version of Bloomfield's \\"Vedic Concordance\\"), and even to the highly regarded German translation by Geldner (not a lot of help for me there...). I found that her renderings tend to be a bit sparse, or at least concise, compared to most, but she uses headnotes and end notes to fill up gaps by explaining implications, instead of interpolating extra words or phrases to make clear her understandings of passages.    This is an intriguing and attractive look at the hymns and songs of ancient India, although this volume is at best an adjunct to an appreciation of the living religion.	2003-09-21

Looted before his time by Macedonians, Romans, and warring Greeks, it has since suffered from religious upheaval, antiquities collectors of various types, and, not least, the demolition of ancient structures to obtain building materials and limestone (for fertilizer). The notes to Peter Levi's translation (which is in two volumes -- if you order it, be sure to get both) gives many instances of these loses. This is not for someone planning a visit to Greece in the immediate future, nor easy reading for the curious (although browsing can be fun), but it is a remarkably valuable contribution to modern knowledge of the ancient world.<br /><br />Sometime during the reign of Hadrian, a very well-read Greek set down a description of the Greek mainland, paying attention mainly to pre-Roman structures and works of art. A long tradition of German scholarship has denied that Pausanias ever left his library, ignoring English \\"amateurs\\" who had little trouble following him on the ground. Those interested in this controversy, or uncertain of whether they want to commit themselves to a work of this size, can now turn to Christian Habicht's first-rate introduction to the book and its critical reception, \\"Pausanias' Guide to Ancient Greece.\\" Habicht also evaluates existing translations, including this one.<br /><br />There is no substitute, however, for the riches lying within what looks like a dry account of buildings and natural wonders.<br /><br />First of all, Pausanias had the good sense to avoid retelling the best-known stories and historical episodes, and give space to lesser-known material. It is thanks to manuscripts of his work that we have, for examples, the stories of the Messenian struggles against Sparta (a fascinating mixture of history and patriotic romance), and some of the more obscure episodes of Athenian history under Macedonian rule.<br /><br />Secondly, Pausanias provides otherwise unknown versions of many classical myths, explaining exactly where they were told, and how they were connected to the local cults. This is an extremely valuable source for Greek mythology as part of a living culture, instead of a literary theme. From time to time we get a glimpse of rituals, and frequently we learn of abandoned cults and forgotten shrines -- it is sometimes hard to remember that the ancient world was subject to profound changes, even before the rise of Christianity or the Barbarian Invasions. (Come to think of it, Pausanias includes interesting details of a Celtic invasion of Greece which is seldom mentioned in modern general histories.)<br /><br />Finally, if read with great care, Pausanias provides an extraordinary amount of detail about the physical realities of the ancient world. Used with intelligence, it has been of enormous value to archeologists. On the other hand, the descriptions are sometimes extremely obscure, due to unstated assumptions as well as textual corruptions, and the application of Pausanias to the evidence of excavations has often been controversial. (Habicht is, again, a good introduction to the issues.)<br /><br />Although Levi's translation is not always ideal (the distribution between two volumes is eccentric, and some passages, such as the list of Spartan kings, are shortened) , and the line drawings which illustrate it are sometimes as frustrating as they are helpful, it is a handy, relatively inexpensive, and mostly very reliable, contribution.<br /><br />[Notes, September 2013: As will be evident to anyone reading this on Amazon, Penguin has since issued the \\"Guide\\" in a Kindle edition -- still in two \\"volumes\\" (which I find annoying).

Sprague de Camp's Antiquity	I have discussed this book in a review of the paperback edition, in which I addressed some of the issues raised by previous reviewers. In this review I will point out some other characteristics of interest to possible readers.<br /><br />This is an adventure novel, set during the reign of Xerxes, Originally published in 1961, it was the third written, and earliest in chronological order, of five loosely-related historical novels. The others are: \\"An Elephant for Aristotle\\" (1958), in the reign of Alexander the Great, involving a trek across Asia with a rather large gift for the philosopher; \\"The Bronze God of Rhodes\\" (1960), in which the background is the struggle among Alexander's successors, with the construction of the Colossus of Rhodes only one of the incidents; \\"The Arrows of Hercules\\" (1965), a story of war and military inventions in the time of Plato; and, finally, \\"The Golden Wind\\" (1969), concerning sea-borne trade and exploration in Hellenistic times.<br /><br />\\"Dragon\\" is probably closest in mood to de Camp's fantasy novels, while \\"Bronze God\\" and \\"Arrows\\" are closer to his science fiction, with their description of engineering problems, and personality clashes among researchers and engineers. \\"Dragon\\" also reflects de Camp's then-recent acquaintance with the Conan stories and other works of Robert E. Howard. Bessas, the huge Persian nobleman, is not only a close match for Conan in physique, but his mood swings, fixation on his mother, and tendency to toss off verses, seems a reflection of Howard himself. (Fortunately, his poems reflect de Camp's verbal dexterity and wit, not Howard's melancholy.)<br /><br />Earlier editions include the original Doubleday hardcover, and a paperback edition from long-defunct Lancer Books (which also published most of de Camp's editions of the Conan stories). The illustrated edition is perhaps the most desirable, but readers who love high adventure, exotic locales, authentic detail, and more than a little humor, will enjoy it in any format.<br /><br />{Please note that Amazon's after-the-fact decision to link editions has left me with two (non-duplicating) reviews for this title; I have decided to leave them in place for the time being, instead of merging them, or deleting both and creating a new version.}<br /><br />{Additional Note: Amazon has since re-separated the reviews; my other review is now found with the Donning (illustrated) edition only.}y it in any format.<br /><br />{Please note that Amazon's after-the-fact decision to link editions has left me with two (non-duplicating) reviews for this title; I have decided to leave them in place for the time being, instead of merging them, or deleting both and creating a new version.}<br /><br />{Additional Note: Amazon has since re-separated the reviews; my other review is now found with the Donning (illustrated) edition only.}	2003-09-18

Nor is it a compendium of mythology (the narrative content is remarkably small). Nor is it (an early but durable misconception) &#34;the Egyptian Bible&#34;. The name applies to a number of collections of spells, prayers, hymns, and instructions (the contents varying from copy to copy, and over time), which were included in tombs. They were intended to assist the deceased in achieving a happy existence (and avoiding destruction) in the afterlife. The contents are, in this context, quite utilitarian. To the Egyptians it was &#34;Coming Forth by Day&#34; (as a glorified spirit), and those who could afford it commissioned beautifully executed copies as essential equipment for their long-term future. Many copies, including the Papyrus of Ani, included numerous illustrations (some exquisite) of major and minor gods, the intended owner and his family, and scenes of the (very earthly) Next World. The collection emerged from earlier bodies of tomb and coffin literature during the New Kingdom, and versions continued to be produced into Roman times.  This particular edition reproduces (beautifully) the color edition of the New Kingdom &#34;Papyrus of Ani&#34; published by the British Museum in 1890. That version was edited by E.A.W. Budge -- who had purchased the scroll in Egypt -- in collaboration with another Victorian-era Egyptologist, Le Page Renouf. This modern presentation is actually an improvement, since computer manipulation has allowed the rejoining of material which Budge arbitrarily separated when preparing the brittle papyrus for shipment by pasting sections on wooden blocks. (The papyrus has, inevitably, deteriorated since it was unrolled. The few modern reproductions of images from it which I have seen were a letdown after the early descriptions. James Wasserman's Preface, which mentions this problem, refers to photographs in an Egyptological series, which I have not seen.)  That first edition was always rare and expensive, and hardly ever available today, and then at a very high price indeed. It was followed in 1895 by a popular edition, prepared by Budge, containing the text in a hieroglyphic transcription, interlinear transliterations and translations, a more polished translation, and an elaborate introduction and other apparatus, including supplementary material from roughly contemporary texts, and some black and white line-drawing versions of the illustrations. This latter edition has been reissued for decades by Dover Publications, and at first glance it looks like a wonderful bargain. The arrangement looks promising, and the hieroglyphic font was a brilliant example of nineteenth-century design.  Unhappily, Budge was not only writing in the nineteenth century, he was already behind the times even then. His transliteration is utterly obsolete, and his smooth translation misleading (although the interlinear translation is sometimes helpful figuring out the original word order when comparing translations by others). His introduction and commentary are full of errors (or then-current misconceptions), and he devotes a lot of space to almost-forgotten controversies (useful to the serious student, a waste of time to most readers). I enjoy looking at it, but have never trusted it.  Budge went on to edit a &#34;complete&#34; Book of the Dead, the hieroglyphic text of which is still cited, and a translation of that text, still (or recently) in print (under the Arkana and other imprints) and also misleading. (There are also other editions of the 1895 version of the Papyrus of Ani, with less lavish layout.)  For anyone who has longed for the color plates of Budge's original edition, and dreamed of a modern translation of what it says, this edition will meet most demands. It does not (alas!) havea modern transliteration, but that is its only real lack. It contains a limited, but useful, commentary. There are translations, based on critically edited versions of those &#34;Chapters&#34; found in the Papyrus of Ani, on the same pages as the facsimiles. Like Budge's popular edition, it also contains translations of important material from other copies of the collection from the same period (known in the scholarly literature as &#34;The Theban Recension&#34;).  The translations are based on those by the late Raymond Faulkner, which also appear, with other material, in another &#34;Book of the Dead&#34; translation.  So, if you are looking for an outstanding example of Egyptian funerary literature and art from the New Kingdom, you will probably want this book. If you are looking for a general introduction to ancient Egypt, a reference work, or comprehensive anthology of ancient Egyptian literature, try something else. (You will probably want to return to this if what you find there interests you, but that is another matter.)  [Addendum, May 2017: I have found that editions of Budge's &#34;Papyrus of Ani,&#34; both the first, with the color plates, and the revised, without them, are available as PDFs from the Internet Archive (Archive.org), a site hosted by the Library of Congress. The reproduction qualities of the first leave something to be desired (especially taking into account different resolutions on different screen), but they are free. Just to add a little confusion, the color plates edition is apparently available in both the original, three-volume, version, and in a Medici Society reprinting in two volumes.]	2003-09-17
US	30081986	R6EANGEJV5SNV	0192812203	690083350	The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition (Oxford Paperbacks)	Books	5	67	69	N	Y	Ian Myles Slater on A Critical Masterpiece	This is the book which made C.S. Lewis' reputation as a critic of medieval and renaissance literature; in the original, medieval, sense, it was the \\"piece\\" that marked his transition from Apprentice to Master. It was first published in 1936, and has been reprinted many times. (I have 1960s copies of Oxford's 1958 \\"Galaxy Book\\" paperback edition; the cover of the recent Oxford Paperback is a great improvement.) As originally written, it covered the development of allegorical narrative from late classical antiquity to the Elizabethan poet Spenser's \\"Faerie Queene,\\" with particular attention to the \\"Allegorical Love Poems of the Middle Ages\\" (the working title).<br /><br />Unhappily for the book's long-term reputation, Lewis was persuaded to add to the planned text an earlier summary of modern theories of \\"courtly love\\" in medieval life and literature. Lewis himself noted that this theoretical construction did not quite fit the texts he analyzed in detail, and the whole approach is now regarded as at best problematic, and by many as simply wrong. Since Lewis presented the material with unusual clarity and wit, however, he has come to be treated as an authoritative source on \\"Courtly Love\\" theory by some, and attacked as such by others.<br /><br />The rest of the book, being based on original studies of primary sources, retains much of its value. Later textual studies and shifts in crticial theory have only slightly diminished its value, and his discussions of such now-obscure writers as Martianus Capella remain among the most inviting of introductions. Lewis' treatment of  \\"The Romance of the Rose\\" is still illuminating (and the point of departure for many recent re-considerations). His chapter on \\"The Faerie Queene\\" is regarded by some competent scholars as the foundation of modern study of the unfinished epic.<br /><br />Although Lewis never looses sight of the entertainment value of many of the works he discusses (and some of them never had any), he is concerned to show that they addressed real problems of human behavior and emotions, and their presentation in narratives. Norman Cantor (not, on the whole, a great admirer) reports from first-hand experience that the book helped make the study of medieval romances respectable in academic circles. My own reading of the secondary literature (pre- and post-Lewis) brought me to a similar conclusion.<br /><br />It is probably of interest to note that, according to Lewis himself, the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" did  NOT arise from his studies of allegory, and that their allegorical implications arose spontaneously in his mind. One has to wonder whether he would have written \\"The Allegory of Love\\" differently after, rather than before, those experiences.<br /><br />Serious students of English literature, and medieval literature in general, will find \\"The Allegory of Love\\" more than worth their time. So will those who simply enjoy reading Arthurian literature, and several other types of story. For many who are familiar only with Lewis the fantasist, or Lewis the Christian apologist, it will open new perspectives.<br /><br />[Extended Addendum, October 21, 2013]<br />[This is one of my earliest reviews, which I've revised slightly to suit other editions of the book. However, it has been attached to a new Kindle edition of \\"The Allegory of Love\\" (Illustrated and Annotated by Glenn Langohr), about which I feel I should make some comments.]<br /><br />[Although it is nice to have this too-long out-of-print book available again, and at a very nice price, there are some drawbacks to the edition. Footnotes are missing entirely, including those which provide original texts for quotations which Lewis translates in the main text. Some of those translations were into verse, which is at least partly printed as if prose, concealing Lewis's considerable skill. (The combination also conceals his general accuracy at catching the sense and tone of, e.g., Ovid.) The \\"annotations\\" and illustrations attributedto Mr. Langohr consist of captions to a photograph of Lewis and some stock pictures of medieval and Pre-Raphaelite (or similar) art.

Hoffmann Price's long career as a professional writer (he was a friend and contemporary of H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard). Like \\"Jade Enchantress\\" the story combines a likeable but imperfect hero, beautiful women (often, but not always, of supernatural origin), and a fair amount of Chinese history and \\"local color.\\" For example, antagonisms between Buddhists and Taoists are one of the driving forces behind events in \\"Devil Wives,\\" reflecting tensions and events of the T'ang Dynasty, while in \\"Jade Enchantress\\" government corruption and foreign war keep things moving. No prior knowledge is really necessary, although anyone who enjoys either of the books will probably want to find out more about the Celestial Hierarchy, Chinese demons, herbal medicine, and any number of other topics. \\"Devil Wives\\" seems rather closer to Chinese folk traditions, with local nature spirits running more of the show, but both combine Western and Eastern story-telling conventions.    The sort of supernatural women featured in this novel are examples of a rich body of Chinese tradition, which early on merged with stories and beliefs from India, introduced along with Buddhism -- which accounts for the perhaps slightly too-abundant information Price offers the reader. Those who are curious to learn more might try to find a library with a copy of Edward H. Schafer's \\"The Divine Woman: Dragon Ladies and Rain Maidens in T'ang Literature\\" (unfortunately, long out of print, although a new edition was announced in 2005 as \\"forthcoming\\").     Price, who emerged from the pulp fiction era of stock characterizations and ethnic stereotyping, tended to fall into these traps (albeit from a pro-Chinese perspective) even in his late science fiction, like \\"Operation Misfit\\" (1980) and its sequels. In \\"Jade Enchantress,\\" the main focus is on Chinese characters and social roles and outsiders are seen through their eyes, so the alert reader is invited to interpret their perceptions as character development or plot devices instead of authorial opinions. (A similar technique was used by Robert van Gulik to portray Judge Dee in his series of mysteries in T'ang Dynasty China.)  \\"Devil Wives\\" takes place in a more nearly completely Chinese setting, and some of these issues do not arise. It is a pity that Price did not write more such novels -- and that those he did write have not been kept in print.	2003-09-17

The Egyptian &#34;Book of the Dead&#34; - a collection of spells, prayers, hymns, and instructions for success in the afterlife - is a famous, and widely misunderstood document, well worth a first-hand examination. However, potential purchasers should be aware that this is a reproduction of a Victorian edition and translation, and that Budge, the editor and translator, was industrious, sincere, talented, and from time to time brilliant, but already a bit out of date in his approach to ancient Egyptian, even when the book appeared in 1895. This Dover reprint is a monument to obsolete scholarship.  The volume was intended as a companion to, or substitute for, an extremely beautiful facsimile edition of a papyrus copy, which Budge had obtained in Egypt, published in color by the British Museum. The passage of decades has only compounded the problems. Budge's transliteration is obsolete, and his polished translations run roughshod over Egyptian grammar (the interlinear versions being erroneous only over the meanings of specific words). His history of scholarship covers the early decades of Egyptology in more detail than most will find necessary, but of course misses that latter nineteenth century (as well as everything since).  Still, before the appearance of a recent, computer-assisted, facsimile edition, based on the British Museum facsimile, with modern translations (The University of Texas Press, as &#34;The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead&#34;), this was as close as most people would get to one of the major manuscripts of the New Kingdom's &#34;guide to the next world&#34;. My first copy is filled with several decades of corrections and annotations, and I bought a second just to enjoy the beautiful hieroglyphic font in which the text is presented. I am not telling anyone not to buy it; just don't take it as the last word on anything.  [Addendum, May 2017: I have found that editions of Budge's &#34;Papyrus of Ani,&#34; both the first, with the color plates, and the revised, without them, are available as PDFs from the Internet Archive (Archive.org), a site hosted by the Library of Congress. The reproduction qualities of the first leave something to be desired (especially taking into account different resolutions on different screen), but they are free. Just to add a little confusion, the color plates edition is apparently available in both the original, three-volume, version, and in a Medici Society reprinting in two volumes.]	2003-09-17

Hoffmann Price's long career as a professional writer. (He was a friend and contemporary of H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard.) Like \\"Devil Wives of Li Fong,\\" the story combines a likeable but imperfect hero, several beautiful women (often, but not always, of supernatural origin), and a fair amount of Chinese history and \\"local color.\\" For example, antagonisms between Buddhists and Taoists are one of the driving forces behind events in \\"Devil Wives,\\" while in \\"Jade Enchantress\\" government corruption and foreign war keep things moving. No prior knowledge is really necessary, although anyone who enjoys either of the books will probably want to find out more about the Celestial Hierarchy, Chinese demons, herbal medicine, and any number of other topics.<br /><br />\\"Jade Enchantress\\" includes entertaining details of the workings and personnel of the popular Chinese pantheon (apparently correct for some times and places), and (naturally) a fair amount of traditional lore about that obviously magical substance, jade. The Lawrence Schwinger cover art (in shades of jade green, naturally) is beautiful, and appropriate without revealing much about the plot.<br /><br />Price, who emerged from the pulp fiction era of stock characterizations and ethnic stereotyping, tended to fall into these traps (albeit from a pro-Chinese perspective) even in his late science fiction, like \\"Operation Misfit\\" (1980) and its sequels.. Fortunately, in \\"Jade Enchantress,\\" the main focus is on Chinese characters and social roles and outsiders are seen through their eyes, so the alert reader is invited to interpret their perceptions as character development or plot devices instead of authorial opinions. (A similar technique was used by Robert van Gulik to portray Judge Dee as a \\"perfect\\" -- meaning highly conventional -- Chinese official in his series of mysteries also set inT'ang Dynasty China.)<br /><br />It is a pity that Price did not write more such novels -- and that those he did write have not been kept in print.	2003-09-16

Old English manuscripts concerning what would later become such sciences as medicine, botany, and astronomy are assembled in what was, by the standards of the day, a very creditable edition.    Although the book as a whole has never been replaced, and retains its value for major collections and academic libraries, those who need this information should certainly begin somewhere else. Many sections (perhaps all) have been re-edited, some several times, and some have had fairly recent, rather good, translations.    {When this review was originally posted in September 2003, the book was actually available, but the Amazon entry was without the present, highly informative, editorial material describing the contents. I'm leaving it in place, as an independent view, despite the redundancy.}	2003-09-15
US	30081986	R1K9RP857IEDNE	0226668452	687336337	The Odes of Pindar (English and Ancient Greek Edition)	Books	5	19	20	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on Lattimore's Pindar	The late Richmond Lattimore was a poet and a classical scholar. He held, in the opinion of many, an outstanding place among American translators of the classical literature. In the role of a scholar of Greek, he published late in life of series of translations from the New Testament, eventually collected in one volume; it is dedicated to the sense of the Greek text, without theological commitments. In a combined role he was responsible for a long series of distinguished translations, alone and with collaborators, or as an editor.     He appeared as all three in the University of Chicago Press \\"Greek Tragedies,\\" and as translator-poet of the \\"The Iliad,\\" \\"The Odyssey\\", Hesiod (Theogony, Works and Days, and Shield of Heracles), and, in the case at hand, the large-scale lyrics of Pindar (c. 518-438 BC). Originally published by the University of Chicago Press in 1947, and reprinted in paperback in that form, it was reissued in a revised translation in 1976, a few years after C.M. Bowra's British translation had appeared as a Penguin Classic. The Odes are songs for public performance in honor of athletes and other victors (owners of horses and chariot teams) at the major Games of classical Greece in the years around the Persian Wars.    Although Lattimore's Homeric translations are quite well known, and seem to remain continuously in print, his version of Pindar seems to have suffered from the relative obscurity of this magnificent, but difficult, poet, who has almost always found more favor with classical scholars than the public. Given the difficulties in translating his rich, densely allusive, and often terribly obscure poems celebrating long-forgotten athletic contests, this is not surprising.    Lattimore manages to give exceptionally clear translations, without masking the difficulties in following Pindar's lines of thought. His commentary is pretty sparse (as usual), which at least spares most of it from becoming outdated as approaches to Pindar shift. As in mosttranslations (but not Bowra's) the Epinician (Victory) poems are presented in their traditional order, in sets according to the Games (Olympic, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian) with which ancient scholars associated them (not always correctly).    Another translation of the Odes, by G.S. Conway, has been reprinted in Everyman Paperback Classics as \\"The Odes: and Selected Fragments,\\" with an excellent introduction, expanded notes, and translations of additional texts, some fairly substantial, by Richard Stoneman. Stoneman provides a good account of trends in Pindar studies; I have discussed some of the issues he raises in my review of that volume.    A fourth alternative, with a translation facing the Greek texts, is the Loeb Classical Library edition, re-edited in two volumes by William H. Race (1997), which is probably a bit too intimidating for the merely curious reader.    It should be noted that this and several other translations of Pindaros (the full Greek form) have been appearing on the listings as the work of \\"Peter Pindar\\". (Or formerly were, when this review was first written, and for quite a while after I reported it to Amazon.) This was a pseudonym for John Wolcot, an eighteenth century physician and author from Cornwall, and seems to have been used by others as well. Its only connection with the Greek poet is the borrowing of his name.	2003-09-14

In brief, this a very personal utopia for Graves, and closely related to his several historical / mythological novels of Ancient Greece, his theory of poetry and human culture in &quot;The White Goddess,&quot; and probably to his personal life. Many readers have found it enchanting, others tedious or objectionable. It is probably a must-read for those who already know and admire Graves' other writings, but not a good introduction to his work.	2003-09-14

The original US edition was by Farrar Straus and Giroux, and there were US paperback printings by Avon Books in the 1960s, under the alternate title. I have not actually seen any later editions. In any version, it is a sort-of-science-fiction sort-of-novel by the poet, historical novelist, and would-be interpreter of anthropology and mythology, Robert Graves. It presents a tour of a future utopian society in which Graves' views of the ideal sexual (and other social) arrangements are displayed. There are resemblances, perhaps not entirely coincidental, to some of the experiments of the 1960s.<br />The society is based largely on Graves' own reconstruction of prehistoric Greece and the Aegean, as suggested in the novel \\"Hercules My Shipmate\\" (also, I believe, published as \\"The Golden Fleece\\"), and set out more fully in \\"The White Goddess\\" and the introduction and notes in \\"The Greek Myths.\\" The latter two books are formally non-fiction, but \\"The White Goddess\\" is, in my opinion, probably the best fantasy novel ever written which does not have a developed narrative or an obvious plot. (Not a view Graves would have appreciated.)<br />\\"Seven Days in New Crete\\" does have a narrative, however. It was much admired by Fritz Leiber, a science fiction and fantasy writer of distinction, and a fine critic, who explored alternative societies in some of his own writings. (Mainly dystopian; as L. Sprague de Camp warned science fiction writers, utopias are insipid by virtue of their perfection). \\"Seven Days\\" is sure to intrigue anyone who has enjoyed Graves' books about antiquity, but it would be a poor introduction to his work. Those interested in utopian fiction in general will probably also find it of considerable interest.	2003-09-12
US	30081986	R385VR0C8O19C7	0231067151	303285038	The Tso Chuan	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on History Disguised as Commentary	The &quot;Tso Chuan&quot; is a massive history -- or set of chronicles and stories -- of early China, originally presented as commentaries on the extremely concise &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; ascribed to Confucius. In fact it amounts to a remarkable account of the Chinese feudal states and their rulers as the Chou Dynasty faded. Burton Watson has presented some of the most famous stories, set out to make the narratives clear, in his usual elegant English. It is an engaging presentation, which leaves this reader, at least, wanting more. Since Watson has already given us so much other important Chinese literature, it seems churlish to complain this book is too short, but it is also a tribute to his literary skill -- and possibly to his editorial judgment.<br />There is an earlier, and complete translation by James Legge, as &quot;The Chun Tsew with the Tso Chuen&quot; (Chinese Classics Series). The seemingly inexhaustible Legge's Victorian translation (still available in an edition with Chinese texts) unfortunately prints the &quot;Tso Chuan&quot; in extremely small type, treating it as secondary to the supposedly Confucian Annals. A reader who attempts to follow a story will find many obstacles. Legge's nineteenth-century transliterations also make identifying references difficult for those of us who lack any command of Chinese.	2003-09-11
US	30081986	R1ZKULKXX6J2WU	0674500008	877934044	The Kalevala or Poems of the Kaleva District	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on "Prose, but Enjoyable and Useful"	Note: This is the hardcover edition of the Magoun translation; it is now in print in trade paperback, as \\"The Kalevala: Or Poems of the Kaleva District,\\" and I have included a shorter version of this review under that edition. I have also given a briefer notice to the same translator's version of the \\"Old Kalevala\\" (a translation of the shorter first edition of the Finnish original).    \\"Kalevala,\\" variously translated as \\"Kaleva District\\" or \\"Land of Heroes,\\" is a nineteenth-century compilation, revision, and expansion of narratives, spells and charms, and proverbial wisdom collected from the Finnish-speaking peasants and fisherman of areas of modern Finland and Russia. It is made up largely, but not entirely, of \\"runos,\\" narrative songs which even then survived in isolated, \\"fringe\\" areas; ballads with clear connections with other cultures also make an appearance. The material is, for the most part, clearly pagan in origin, with hints of roots in the Viking Age, if not earlier, but processed through centuries of Christianity, Catholic and Lutheran in Finland proper, Russian Orthodox in the Karelia district. Fortunately, Elias Lonnrot, the main collector, and the man responsible for this literary version, was also engaged in laying the foundations of the scientific study of folk traditions, and the collections he made or sponsored formed the basis of a major archive, the publication of which was only recently completed. In the meantime, his popularization had become a part of the world's culture, as well as that of Finland.    The contents are various, but the main themes are the military and romantic adventures and misadventures of a handful of warrior-magicians, quite as quick with an incantation as with a sword. Vainamoinen, \\"the Eternal Sage,\\" and a kind of demiurge who sings the Finnish homeland into being, is born old, and his attempts to find a wife lead to the creation of the mysterious and wonderful \\"Sampo\\" by the smith Ilmarinen, as a kind of bride-price.These two great heroes share the stage with the irresponsible Lemminkainen, a kind of combined Don Juan and Achilles, and the hapless Kullervo. His story, presented as a cantata by Sibelius, is one of the underpinnings of Tolkien's \\"Silmarillion.\\" (When the latter first appeared, it seemed obvious that the Quest for the Sampo, and its ultimate fate, was a major inspiration for Tolkien; publication of his early versions show that most of the resemblances emerged over time, in the course of endless reworkings.)    The tireless Lonnrot's literary version went through two major versions, the \\"Old Kalevala,\\" which has been translated into English once, by Francis P. Magoun, Jr., in 1969, and the \\"New\\" Kalevala. Not counting abridged versions and retellings, this was first translated into English, by way of an 1852 German translation, in 1888. The epic was translated directly from Finnish, into imitative verse, in 1907, by W.F. Kirby, a version reprinted for decades in Everyman's Library, in which form it profoundly moved the young J.R.R. Tolkien; there have been several recent reprint editions. In the meantime, Longfellow, already acquainted with European versions, used it as a model for his \\"Hiawatha,\\" importing a version of the Finnish meter for the purpose. Hence, in an historical paradox, Kirby's translation is often described as being in the \\"Hiawatha meter.\\" Unfortunately, it seems to work better in Finnish than English.    Neither of these versions was satisfactory for serious study, however, and \\"Kalevala\\" is important as, variously, an example of: nineteenth-century romanticism; European nationalist literature; ethnography; folklore; oral epic literature; and, not least, a really good story. To fill at least some of these lacks, Magoun, a leading authority on early Germanic and other medieval literature, prepared a prose translation, published in 1963. It is set out in lines corresponding to the Finnish verses, together with a selection of the early secondary literature (introductions and essays), and a useful apparatus of glossaries, lists of charms, etc. He summarizes modern views, meaning the scholarship of the 1950s. Later printings contain several pages of Corrigenda (corrections and improvements) which originally appeared in his 1969 translation of the \\"Old Kalevala.\\" (Note: the verses are set out as long lines, with a caesura, not as the couplets, used in most, but not all, Finnish editions; the result looks more like \\"Beowulf\\" than Longfellow.)    Although Magoun's translations are quite readable, neither volume is notable for its charm. Sober utility of presentation is the main note, with the main concession being translations of many of the opaque-looking, but meaningful names (Finnish originals in the apparatus, of course). Kirby, despite many failings, was often pleasant to read. (Tolkien, who had been inspired by it to study Finnish, thought that Kirby's version of the rollicking \\"Creation of Beer\\" episode was funnier than the original.) There have been two later translations of the \\"New Kalevala\\" into English verse, by Eino Friberg (1988) and Keith Bosley (1989), which many will find more appealing. Bosley has also translated a selection of the \\"Kanteletar,\\" Lonnrot's collection of songs, ballads, and spells, (portions of which also appear in \\"Kalevala\\"), and was one of the translators of a volume of the actual songs as collected. But for those who want both the story and all of the details, and either don't care about, or don't care for, such things as meter and rhyme, Magoun's translation remains a first choice. For those who know the epic through other translations, it is still worth consulting. I hold it in high regard.	2003-07-07

This is a translation of the first, shorter, version, which Elias Lonnrot substantially revised and expanded in the light of new materials which he and his associates collected in the aftermath of the success of this version. F. P. Magoun's English version, a sequel to his similar prose translation of the \\"New\\" Kalevala some years earlier, includes samples of the old songs, and early attempts to reconstruct a cycle of Finnish heroic legends.    For those who know and love the better-known \\"Kalevala,\\" and for those interested in how authentic folklore was transformed into a major work of literature, \\"The Old Kalevala\\" will be fascinating reading. It may also be of interest to Tolkien's more devoted readers, who are aware of his early love of the Kirby translation of the Kalevala, his studies of Finnish, and the effect of both on the development of both the Elvish languages and the \\"Silmarillion.\\"	2003-07-03
US	30081986	RW5IS8IAZI1TU	0898652278	762293976	The Dragon of Ishtar Gate	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on History as Heroic Romance	I will try to keep this short and factual, despite my enthusiasm for a book I have admired for over thirty years.     This is one of a series of loosely-linked historical novels set mainly on the margins of the classical world (from India to the interior and coasts of Africa), and covering the period from the reign of Xerxes to late Hellenistic times. (Think in terms of the Battle of Salamis to the rise of Rome). They all share de Camp's meticulous detail, plausible characterization, and sense of the comic side of human nature. Readers familiar with de Camp as Robert E, Howard's posthumous editor and collaborator will find in them the same mix of exotic adventure and (to most of the participants) magic, but in de Camp's own urbane and quietly erudite voice. Those already familiar with his own fantasy and science fiction writing will not be surprised to see his characteristic virtues at work in a different genre.    This, my favorite, concerns a journey from the heart of the Persian Empire to the sources of the Nile, in pursuit of an imaginary beast. A giant Persian nobleman, in serious trouble as a result of innocent involvement in a (real) court scandal, is sent off on a quest with his Greek tutor as advisor. They take turns playing Sancho to the other's Don Quixote, as their personal traits prove helpful or dangerous in changing circumstance. Along the way they acquire and lose companions, stumble into and out of trouble, and provide the reader a tour of the ancient world from western Asia to central Africa.    The suggestions for the story came from the presence of a now-rare African animal on a Persian royal monument and an archaeologist's speculation on a possible priestly fraud in ancient Babylon. (The latter reflects the story of \\"Bel and the Dragon\\" in the Greek version of the Book of Daniel, found in the apocrypha of Protestant Bibles, and appended to Daniel in Catholic editions). Those interested in this background should seek out \\"Lands Beyond,\\" by L. Sprague de Camp and Willy Ley (originally 1951). (It should be pointed out that the word \\"sirrush\\" in both books is now generally read as \\"mushhush\\"). Some of the Asian material is also covered in de Camp's \\"Great Cities of the Ancient World\\" (originally 1972).    The African scenes are based on a combination of de Camp's travels and the best information available when he was writing. Those readers familiar with early European accounts will not need de Camp's acknowledgment of sources to spot the origin of several scenes. Those who are familiar with current studies of ancient Africa should bear in mind that no author, no matter how careful, can be expected to be in advance of the state of knowledge. (The solution to the \\"what is the most dangerous beast in Africa?\\" will now be apparent to far more readers than when the expedition's pygmy guide tried to answer it.) De Camp returned to Africa in his 1969 historical novel \\"The Golden Wind,\\" set in Hellenistic times, this time from the point of view of a Greek sea captain seeking a water route to India.    The Donning edition added illustrations to a book originally published by Doubleday in 1961, and reprinted by Lancer in 1968. The Lancer edition had a glorious but uncredited cover, which was apparently the work of Roy G. Krenkel, perhaps still best known for his covers for the early Ace edition of Tarzan, and the illustrator of \\"Great Cities\\".	2003-06-17
US	30081986	RBXJLQIPF1257	0691026475	22201919	Nart Sagas from the Caucasus: Myths and Legends from the Circassians, Abazas, Abkhaz, and Ubykhs	Books	4	32	32	N	N	Ian Myles Slater on The Amazing Narts, Now in English!	If you like mythology, but have never heard of the Narts, don't worry that you've overlooked something obvious; most translations of the stories about them have so far been into Russian, French, and German. On the other hand, you may have encountered references to them in studies of, for example, the Balder myth. Now a very full selection of the range of stories and characters is available, although not in the forms usually cited. Colarusso has excluded from this volume the Ossetian versions of the Nart stories, which have had a more prominent place in scholarly discussions of the mythologies and legends of the Indo-European peoples, providing instead a first real look for readers of English at the equally interesting versions from neighboring peoples.<br /><br />For me, the volume was also a fascinating introduction to many of the cultures of the Caucasus Mountains and the coastlands of the Black Sea. Unexpectedly, but not too surprisingly in retrospect, the often rather ambiguous protagonist of one version may show up as the villain in a variant of the story told elsewhere!<br /><br />The description and quotations provided in the posting here at Amazon are a fair representative of the stories of the heroes and (probably) faded gods who populate these ancient oral traditions. Although the total picture is both unusual and varied, the reader may find the stories hauntingly familiar, suggesting here a bit of Asgard, and there a little of Olympus, at another point the Finn Cycle, and elsewhere a touch of Robin Hood or the Border Ballads.<br /><br />Some of the resemblances are probably coincidental, others suggests ancient contacts between civilizations, and the spreading and staying power of good stories. If Colarusso and others, notably Georges Dumezil, are correct, some reflect a common origin, before the dispersal of Indo-European speakers across Europe and Asia. (This view assumes that the Ossetian versions, in an Iranian language, are in direct descent, and thetellings in the non-Indo-European Caucasus languages are ultimately borrowings. A common origin for Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Northwest-Caucasian [Proto-Pontic] has been proposed, but is very problematic. And would be so ancient as to have little explanatory value, I would think, for the Nart stories!)<br /><br />Unfortunately, Colarusso's frequent, and usually useful, comparisons to more widely known mythologies, notably those of Greece and Scandinavia, show heavy dependence on secondary sources, by which I mean reference works, not translations. Partly as a result, there are a number of trivial, but annoying, avoidable errors. Some examples: the son of Anchises and Aphrodite was Aeneas, not Adonis (this seems to go back to Robert Graves' &#34;Greek Mythology,&#34; where Anchises and Adonis are in sequence as lovers of the goddess, and her offspring are postponed to a later chapter); Odin's raven-messengers, &#34;Thought&#34; and &#34;Memory&#34; (Huginn and Muninn) are confused with his brothers, Vili (&#34;Will&#34;) and Ve (&#34;Holiness&#34; or &#34;Shrine&#34;). (I at first thought Colarusso might be citing a theory that they *should* be identified, which would be interesting; but apparently not.)<br /><br />Those unfamiliar with any of the mythologies he cites (and I am not well acquainted with a number of them) should therefore treat his references with a little caution. Fortunately, the errors which I spotted did not make a great difference to his arguments and conclusions.<br /><br />I would also view with reserve some of his suggested replacements for accepted etymologies, such as that for the Norse god Odin. (The usual etymology *is* a little odd-looking, but the required form has a Germanic parallel he doesn't mention; a long story.)<br /><br />Despite these problems with non-Caucasus material, the book as a whole is richly rewarding for those with an interest in a &#34;new&#34; mythology.	2003-06-12
