US	53029048	RA5ZETLS57C9N	0312991436	783654043	Brilliant	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Rather fanciful but a fun, suspenseful read	(Please read the plot summary.)  I enjoyed the book mostly for the vivid informatioon it provided about the world of the great London auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's, and the business of top-level auctions.  Then we move on to the rags-to-riches story of a fictional, but major, auction house's top-level employee, the heroine Kick (what a name! Rock Hudson's niece?) Keswick, and her obsession with precious stones and luxury jewelry, which leads to her night job as a mistress jewel thief of unparallel skill. <br /> <br />The auction house is bought out by a brash American, and wheels start spinning, with Kick caught in more than a few.  The Plot starts moving quickly, with more turns and reverses than a maze.  There's the predictable (Kick has an affair with the brash American) and the unexpected (a pact between the auction house and the last Russian royals).  And all of the time she leads a life of luxury, described in mouth-watering, eye-pleasing detail. <br /> <br />It's silly but it's a fun read, far more sophisticated than recent cozies, which is the closest genre in which I could place it.  My only serious quibble is that the book contains a fair number of typographical errors and simple grammatical errors.  At this price level, that's unforgiveable.	2005-10-08

The heroine, a wealthy widow, still dresses for dinner and expects her guests at a private island vacation home in Maine to do so, too.  Long-time family retainers drift in and out of scenes, always knowing their places. I went to a private Catholic girls' HS in the 1960s and never ran into characters so refined. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, just as I'll never meet Miss Marple and her antiquated neighbors in St. Marys Mead (but love them just the same), or find their modern equivalent, I find this sort of tale an occasional pleasure - so many of the crime fiction published today, 2005, seem to be in a contest to be more violent and graphic than the next.  Neither extreme is really an honest representation, so why does so much of the genre tilt towards brute force, rather than cleverness? <br /> <br />The slender plot of The Gladstone Bag isn't very important; if you haven't read MacLeod's cozy series about the Kelling clan, you won't be lost but some familiarity does help.  The uber-heroine Sarah's Aunt Emma is babysitting a posh summer \\"cottage\\" that has six guest cabins.  Meals are fully catered in the main house by a professional chef and a full staff attends to guests' other needs. <br /> <br />As she traveled to the island, said to be haunted by the ghost of a pirate guarding his missing treaure, Aunt Emma is mugged and the Gilbert & Sullivan Club's trove of costume jewelry, which she planned to repair, is stolen.  Then most of the guests stage a mutiny and announce that they intend to dig up the entire island in search of the pirate's treasure, if necessary. <br /> <br />The jewelry is recovered but dead bodies are, too; tales get taqngled but eventually Aunt Emma solves it all, with long-distance help from Sarah and her professional-detective husband.   <br /> <br />Author Charlotte MacLeod is, as usual, an expert in this form, never hitting a false note and as dependable as ever for thereader seeking a classic cozy: not too sweet, but just right.	2005-09-27

A pretty standard rehash of all the usual dating problems, especially for women as they get older.  (Older men remain desirable, damn it!) <br /> <br />It is better written than most of the genre and the author is a fitness enthusiast, which adds a different and interesting dimension to her story.  At one point she examines her life, determines what she wants and relocates to a small town in Oregon which seems pretty good.  But it doesn' meet her needs re: men, so she's off again to pursue the elusive Mr. Right. <br /> <br />It's possible to be a happy, single, older woman.

Thus masticated once, it is even more thoroughly chewed upon here, livened only with confessional insights by Woodward about his role in former President Nixon's exit from the Presidency.<br /><br />There's no correct way to review the events of Watergate and what President Nixon did, as the subject involves too many aspects of government and social and political policy.  One's personal politics and maturity will intrude upon any judgment as well.<br /><br />I was 22 in 1974, when President Nixon resigned.  An ardent Nixon critic, I knew the Watergate tale as well as the back of my own hand and danced the night he announced his resignation.  In hindsight, I consider Nixon's wrongs to be perhaps even worse than I did at the time, but I also better understand the thundrous effect the scandal and his resignation had on American politics.<br /><br />There's a direct road from the intellectual, thoughtful Nixon who got caught to the untouchable, lightweight, ineffectual leaders of today.<br /><br />I think Woodward reveals some inklings of a guilty conscience about the role he, Bernstein and the Post played during the Watergate scandals.  In telling his own history, it's clear that Woodward's background in no way prepared him to be a scourge of any institution.  He's a white-bread, all-American, cross-your-ts-and dot-your-is kind of guy who had a lucky break into journalism and then into the Watergate epic, almost his first Post assignment.<br /><br />Woodward isn't responsible for what happened to American politics and the role of the Presidency in the wake of Watergate.  Perhaps Woodward's hubris is confusing himself with the story.	2005-08-28
US	53029048	RZJYI4J2BFZH9	0525947388	972368191	Bubbles Ablaze	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Very mixed bag: a generous 2 for plot, 4+  for characters	This is the third entry in a slapdash, over-the-top mystery series featuring Bubbles Yablonsky, a hairdresser who looks like trailer trash but who longs to become a respected journalist. On the way to her goal, she stumbles and bumbles into one mystery after another, with the aid and support of the Mel-Gibson-esque Steve Stilleto, a top-level news photographer, whom she met on her first assignment. <br /> <br />Bubbles lives in a small blue/black-collar town in a part of America usually forgotten - the coal mines of Pennsylvania.  Every character has a story connected to mining; Bubbles' father was killed when she was a young girl because, her family believes, he was a union organizer.  Steve, the estranged step-son of a ruthless mine owner, hates his connection to the misery wreaked by Big Coal on innocent men and women. <br /> <br />It's almost impossible to describe a Strohmeyer plot; in a review of an earlier book in the series I think I said she used every idea she ever had.  In my 40-some years of mystery-reading I can't think of a more convoluted (and somewhat ridiculous and highly unbelievable) plot. <br /> <br />In this outing Bubbles has left hairdressing for journalism and gets involved in a life-threatening, mysterious \\"accident\\" in a mine thought to be dormant and where a murder occurs while she and Steve are  there after receiving mysterious messages.  The race is on, with casino gambling, underground mine fires, a pierogi fight and who-knows-what's-next among the dozen or so plots and sub-plots. <br /> <br />Normally that would bother me.  But Strohmeyer has a tremendous gift for creating eccentric characters, ones you usually can't help but love and want more of.  Bubbles can spot a phony ten miles away, but her big heart accepts even the strangest individual, if s/he is hurt and honest (except the multi-pierced \\"G,\\" a suitor for the hand of her beloved, ultra-smart daughter, Jane, whom she has raised single-handedly and for whom she wants a better future than that which Bubbles endured. <br /> <br />Strohmeyer's work resembles that of reigning working-class detectives' Queen Janet Evanovich, but I like Bubbles and her crew more (making me, a NJ native, a traitor of sorts).  Their stories, like Bubbles, continue to develop in each book.  Your suspension of disbelief will have to be extra-willing at times, but the fun to be had makes it worthwhile.	2005-07-27
US	53029048	R2LXDQBLC0QU3Z	0060545607	485010020	With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)	Books	3	12	14	N	N	Disappointing given the rich material	I am assuming you know the general plot.  We have our hero, Lynley, et al., fighting a dreadful serial killer (but what serial killer isn't dreadful?) while he must do a solo battle with higher-ups who wish to use the investigation politically.  His team has been augmented with others, given the enormity of the case, and he must get some truly strong personalities to work together.  On the home front, he and Helen are expecting their first child. <br /> <br />Havers, our regular heroine, is at odds with the Muslim neighbors (father and daughter) she has become involved with, making her more edgy than usual. <br /> <br />The backdrop is the \\"new London\\" of recent crime novels, a place riven with sexual depravity, the last vestiges of class warfare and the crimes naturally spawned by poverty and ignorance.  Most of this last drama is played out in the tale of Sgt. Nkata, a succesful black detective uneasy in the predominantly white Met, and that of a successful but greatly troubled social-services agency with strong, but unintentional, links to the crimes being investigated.  This ain't Miss Marple. <br /> <br />A nice table of fixins', indeed.  But, as others have noted, George proceeds as if she were paid by the word in her laborious attention to detail.  Most characters are potrayed at great length and depth, as if by a shrink.  Her characters often \\"plod,\\" but this time I felt as if I were doing the plodding as I pushed through the book's 600+ pages. <br /> <br />About half-way through, an almost unimaginable tragedy occurrs, and serves to ooze into every main character's actions (except those of the killer), stalling the book's action even more. <br /> <br />I usually race through the last quarter of such a book but, even though I had ample time, it took three days for me to finish that much of the book.  I kept falling asleep.  I was worn out by all of the story's travails and misery, and the work I had to do to keep up with the investigation and the characters.<br /> <br />I hope George continues the series, as that is uncertain at the close of the book. If the high drama was merely a way to take Lynley in a new direction, I don't think a twist this upsetting, or this dramatic, was necessary.  We've seen him change before without such drastic punishment. <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

For example, the city's top-regarded Symphony Orchestra is made up of the members of the Musicians Union, #1. By the early 20th century Cincinnati's power and resources attracted the notice of political bosses as far away as New York, who took over the city only to be turned back in a precedent-setting, peaceful citizen revolt that created the City-Manager form of government. <br /> <br />Against this backdrop, in 1988 Cincinnati celebrated its Bicentennial, taking in the various periods of its history: a crude, frontier settlement; a lively time as a major stop for inland water trade; a period preceding Chicago as \\"Hog Butcher of the World\\"; the main target of Prohibitionist Carrie Nation's wrath as the headquarters of many breweries; and today as a sophisticated, economically and culturally diverse city.  And more - whew! <br /> <br />To mark this occasion the Cincinnati Historical Society published this lavishly illustrated, highly readable history of the city, initially in two spiral-bound, hard-cover editions in 1988.  What made it special among such histories is the fact that during the Works Projects Administration days of the Depression a cadre of skilled but unemployed historians and writers were hired to write a history of the city, and this book incorporates nearly all of that brilliant work, simply bringing it up to date. <br /> <br />While at times some institutional reverence shows through, by and large the book is independent of its sponsors and tells the city's story, warts and all.  From the 1930s to the mid-1980s Cincinnati was a politically conservative town, although that has changed in the past 20 years as an influx of economic immigrants have joined the ranks. <br /> <br />The native, long-time resident or newcomer to Cincinnati will find something to delight in this book. Yes, I live in Cincinnati and love it, but appreciate the criticiams aired in this book. It should be a model for any popular urban history.	2005-06-30

Our heroine, Wollie, is a perceptive, compassionate and funny woman struggling to survive in the LA maelstrom.  She scratches from job-to-job, happily accepting an apartment-sitting gig to save on rent as well as a dubious role on a reality tv show, hoping to win extended life insurance for herself and her mentaly-ill brother. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book and its precedent.  My quibble is that I think Ms. Kozak tries to do too much.  The byzantine array of plots and subplots introduce us to a cast of characters so large you wish at times you had a scorecord to keep them straight. <br /> <br />Given that, Kozak's writing is still energetic and fresh and doesn't reveal any of the burn-out that has crept into the writing of her contempoaries in recent years. <br /> <br />	2005-06-17

What they don't tell you is that this purported tale of brothers traveling the world is really an account of the author's current immature life.  The warning is given when he provides an extended account of his wedding, canceled at the last minute - but the failings of the relationship, as he tells it, are all her fault.  Same goes for the scenario when he loses his cushy job. <br /> <br />Among the many countries and cities the brothers visit are Prague, a vibrant, beautiful, ancient city spared the ravages of war, and the newly-born Russia, but all we learn about is how girlfriends are picked up and carelessly discarded.  The author falls back on his career as a Republican operative to finagle favors from foreigners.  He is often smug about his fellow American travelers, criticizing their \\"hippie\\" outlook but not really separating himself from them. <br /> <br />The only thing I liked were the author's letters to his step-grandmother.  They are warm and finally perceptive observations about his travels are shared.	2005-06-17

Ms. Young deftly tells the story of the actual tragedy - I had no idea so many people were seriously injured in addition to one person who died - and the almost miraculous response of local and state medical personnel.  Undoubtedly, many lives were saved by forward-thinking, decisive individuals. <br /> <br />After the event, Ms. Young mostly allows the story to be told in a series of interviews and re-interviews with those of the major players who would cooperate with her.  Given the obvious thoroughness of the author's efforts, it's a shame we don't have a more complete account, but I think the author has done her best to fill in for what she couldn't get directly. <br /> <br />I belong to a church that once went through a political catastrophe and \\"deja vus\\" were pealing in my head as I read of the church members' bickering and wrangling that probably led to the poisonings.  Ms. Young captures the typical personalities well and her analysis of the dynamics struck me as right on the mark after what I survived.  It is hard to believe what is often done in the name of God. <br /> <br />I gave the book 4 instead of 5 stars because it needed at least a good index.  Some genealogical family trees that would help keep the major players straight would have been a big help, too, instead of some rather boring photos.	2005-06-11

Roth's writing has never been finer, conjuring up images so well you hear every sound and smell every aroma.  It takes some effort, however, to believe an anti-Semetic government such as he describes could actually take over America, but if you're willing to go on the ride, it's a great read.  Until the ending, that is, which is so foolish and contrived I'm surprised a writer of Roth's reputation succombed to this all-too-frequent weakness of modern novels. <br /> <br />I suppose Roth is trying to warn us of the need to safeguard our civil liberties.  Even as a Gore/Kerry voting liberal, I think he overstates the problem.	2004-12-15

I would only add that you learn how Careme pulled together the skills of speciality cooks to create grand meals and, in turn, earned the title of chef.  Sadly, the very process or cooking (carbon monoxide and partilate matter in the lungs from charcoal-fuled stoves and ovens) killed him while only in his 40s but he was dedicated to writing about his skills as much as he used them, thus codifying what we know as Haute' cuisine and creating the first modern cookbooks. <br /> <br />Fortunately Kelly's writing style does not bog down in detail and he is quite readable.

Bookman Cliff Janeway is visited in his Denver store by a very old lady with an inprobable story: her grandfather was a confidant of the great translator, explorer and writer, in the months leading up to the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War, no less, and - here it comes - in the city of Charleston, S.C., where the War started! Gee golly willikers! As Janeway looks into the matter to find some lost Burton journals more death and mayhem occurs, he acquires two female assistants and you will learn more about Burton than you ever hoped to.     I'm irked. I liked the earlier Janeway books and found them unique among the plethora of mysteries.     I happen to know of Burton and think him a genius but even this was this too much for me; the plot is hopelessly convoluted and boring and the ending quite confusing and unsatisfying.

Mundy agrees to be a front for the effort and finds himself again facing his compatriots from his spying days.<br />To tell more would be to spoil the story.

As usual, James Lee Burke's latest Dave Robicheax novel is a loose police procedural set in southern, rural Louisiana, although he ventures into The Big Easy occasionally.  As usual, a huge, sprawling web of corruption and racial prejudice is revealed layer by layer as Robicheax investigates an assassination attempt on a priest and the death of three teenage girls in an alcohol-fueled car accident.<br />Robicheaux has suffered some major, surprising losses since the last book, and much of the story concerns his grieving over these losses - angst familiar to Burke's readers.<br />I thought the writing was better than usual - more exact poetry in his descriptions of the landscape and characters.  The angst, violence and weight of an incredibly complicated plot tend to bog the story down near the end.  It also rains a lot!<br />I love Burke's work, however, for his ability to describe the souls of men and women in trouble.  I tend to forgive his excesses of plot and character as he, like any gtreat crime novelist, is willing to tackle the hard, but essential, questions of good and evil.	2004-02-13

Considering that authors ranging in quality from Tom Wolfe to John Grisham have tackled this theme, you'd think that Smiley would either offer a new take on the subject or devise irresistible characters.

I still think the sex is overdone, but I have more respect for how Block showed the city's pain post-9/11, and how even in that vast metropolis a feew lives can intersect and create, indeed, a small town of support.    I like mystery/thrillers.  I tend to like Lawrence Block's books a lot, all the way from punster Bernie the Bookselling Burglar to the dark paths trod by Matt Scudder.  But Small Town, which is independent of his usual characters, is a major disapopintment.    It's a shame, because the first 90% of the book is riveting, even if an often distasteful sub-plot that pushes the boundaries of soft-core porn trails along the major action.    A serial killer who comes to be called the Carpenter is on the loose in the months leading up to 9/11/02.  He had retired shortly before that terrible day that the Towers fell, and lost his pregnant daughter, son-in-law and son in the collapses, and then his wife a few weeks later to a suicide.  He is taking revenge on the city that betrayed him, and his seemingly random methods puzzle the police.  His first crime is blamed on a crime writer who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and this character's story is well told, including marvelous bits about the NYC publishing world.    A retired but youthful police commisioner finds his interest piqued, and attempts to find the Carpenter before it's too late, as he surmises that the Carpenter has his major kill planned for the first anniversary of his family's deaths.    The writer and the commissioner share a woman who owns a contemporary folk art gallery, who has decided to base her life on sexual gratification (and it's explicit, folks).    While the saga of the Carpenter is brought to the close, none of the other story lines are.  Not satisfactorily, at least.  As I had found myself caring about these characters, I was furious!  Such a cheap ploy makes mewant my hours of reading restored to my life.	2003-03-10

Ashes to Ashes is a police procedural set in Minneapolis, wher the cops are trying to find a particularly sadistic serial murderer of young women.<br />The cops have the politicains on their backs, and the state's wealthiest man gets involved, too, calling in an FBI profiler when his daughter goes missing.<br />I enjoyed the procedural aspects and despite the gruesome nature of the crimes, Hoag doesn't dwell on the details as much as some of her contemporaries do.  Still, it's not for the squeamish.  There's a nifty and credible plot twist at the end, and I recommend this for fans of the genre.	2003-02-21

There's no serial murderer this time, but two suspicious suicides involving one family catch the attention of Sgt. Kovac and his partner, \\"Tinks.\\"<br />Hoag broadens her canvas to include a sub-plot concerning police reality shows and the plight of gay cops, which complement the main story well.  Meanwhile we are immersed in a classic and well-done procedural.<br />Hoag's characters and settings are vivid and in this book she has toned down the gore, as compared to Ashes to Ashes.  I highly recommend it.	2003-02-21

Some are straight-on photos nad others have filters to bring out particular details.  Either way, you will be spellbound as you page through the book.<br />The printing and paper are of the highest quality, adding to the experience.<br />One problem: the captions for the photos are in an appendix of the book, and it's annoying to flip back and forth to learn what you are looking at.	2003-02-21

She prepares her supplies, falls in love with a married man and has an affair, and becomes a sleuth, tracking down the psychotic who has stalked her and terrorized the community.<br />Barton is one of my heroes, so I enjoyed seeing what Day did in her fictionalization, even if it doesn't ring true with what I already know about her.  I also adore the South Sea Islands area of the U.S., and Day more than does justice to the natural beauty of the area and its people.  A nice subplot has Barton helping a young black boy become literate and find a future.  The horrors of our Civil War are also brought to life well.<br />But the book's pace is too slow, and Barton's bodice-ripping romance is a bit amateur.  Any reader of the murder-mystery genre will find the stalcker entirely predictable.<br />Get it at the library.	2002-10-17

The novel's theme of Old World meets New World is glaringly obvious, and as shallow as the river on which it is set.  The characters most often are caricatures - at time I thought, &quot;Was this written by Monty Python?&quot;  Nevertheless, McMurtry's lyric pen and ability to conjure up the geography of this once unspoilt country are intact.<br />Sin Killer is the first of a planned tetralogy (four books), and one can only hope that theis master of Western frontier fiction returns to form in the remaining books.	2002-06-18

However, the magnitude of convoluted plotting and superhuman heroics dumped on the unsuspecting reader in Last Man Standing goes over the line.  The hero, an improbably named Web London, is an FBI hostage rescue expert who lives with bordeline psychosis and the ability to heal from his repeated life-threatening wounds.  He is the only man to survive an ambush and drags his survivor guilt thoughout the remainder of the book like the carcass of a moose.  Balducci is clearly riding on his reputation in this maddening book.	2002-06-10

It's a culture still based on the plantation system socially, if not legally.  Disturbing the uneasy peace between the races is the impending execution of a young black man, who has been convicted of the crime of killijg a white man in a store robbery.  The book is the stoy of how he learns to face that death, and the teacher's accompanying apiritual journey.<br />That said, I hated the book.  There is not a good white person or a bad black person in the book.  Perhaps that is true of the book's setting, but why are we still playing the victim game 60 years later?  Slavery and its aftermath were abominations, but things have changed.  And most white/Asian/Hispanic/Native American people - especially women - have some major gripes about the fairness of life, too.<br />There is plenty of literature about the sins of the past, but I'm more interested in how we learn to heal.	2002-04-02

The tale of an aspiring comedian, Molly Solomon, the plot takes turns that are at once unsurprising and familiar.  The brief glimpses we have of Molly's act are funny, but seem out of proportion with the fame she eventually achieves.

In Lord of the Silent, however, I wasn't sure if the action ever really started, despite a series of false apprehensions.

But he is not even a fair writer. Hired to be Robert De Niro's technical assitant for the making of the movie Backdraft, Cosgrove's prose resembles that of a love-sick tween describing a back-stage encounter with a pop music star. Other than knowing that De Niro is famous, and that movies are made, Cosgrove shows no deeper knowledge of his subjects than was presented to him during this experience. Thus, no analysis or depth - strictly a chronological narrative, without any insights.	2001-10-27

Unfortunately, this book is proof of that argument.  The process of making a movie is described in detail, and many major players, both male and female, of the past few decades are interviewed on-the-record about how women are excluded from both decision-masking and screen time.  If you're interested in the business, this is a good read.  but it's not a star-dropping tell-all.	2001-08-14

The book follows the progress of the affair as well as Henry's own awakening feelings about sex and love.  By the end, everyone has learned a lot about themselves and the meaning of family, without any of the hyper-dysfunctional behavior so common in recent novels.

A fairly clever blackmailing scheme by three corrupt judges, jailed in the same prison, accidentally intersects with an evil plot to take over the U.S.A.  The take-over is being engineered by government insiders, presumably within the CIA, who have at their disposal unbelievable resources and technology.  An undertone of homophobia is the final nail in the coffin.  Skip this book - Grisham must have let his dog write it.  (Yes, I'm a cat lover.)	2000-12-07

Mr. Poitier's observations about his life seem superficial, or perhaps his self-admitted lack of education prevents him from articulating his beliefs  fully.  Therefore, it comes off as another platitudinous New Age call for  accepting the spiritual in one own's life, without really sharing the  rigorous sef-inquiry this demands.<br />I did find interesting Mr. Poitier's  deep attachment to the lessons of his childhood.  Although they come from  very different climates and backgrounds, Mr. Poitier's and actor Peter  O'Toole's autobiographies share the same reverence for being of a certain  place, and of being shaped by that place and its values.<br />As compared to  the O'Toole books, however, Mr. Poitier shows he was fortunate to have  writers to create his words for him when performing.	2000-05-03

But if you've read any of his Miami Herald co-worker Carl Hiassen's books, you'll see that BT is a pale imitation of Hiassen's  unique, bizarre and (to me) engrossing style - &quot;Southern Miami  wacko,&quot; as Barry puts it.<br />At the center of the story is a quartet of  innocents, which is surrounded by rings of mobsters, illegal arms-traders  and corrupt contractors.  Add the Miami Police, the FBI and a street person  in love with an illegal immigrant and you've got a wonderful Chaplinesque  comedy, had Chaplin entertained the idea of portable nuclear  weaponry.<br />One thing Barry does better than Hiassen is his female  characters.  Whether out of empathy or better knowledge, his women and  their relationshiops with men ring true.  Unfortunately, Hiassen has him  beaten by a mile in plotting and depth.<br />Wait for the paperback, is my  opinion.  But if you like either Barry or Hiassen, it's worth a read.	1999-09-17
