He lived and worked in Sweden and USA and became a renowned liguist. This dictionary is his most important work on which he has worked, as far as I know, for more than twenty years and which was originally released in 1982.<br /><br />It is an unfortunate truth that many Estonians abroad lose their natural perception for the mother tongue while under heavy influence of the native languages of the countries they live in. Furthermore, it is characteristic for the tragedy of our people that the war refugees were practically excluded from communication with Estonia. That is the reason why a half of a century of the development of the Estonian language has passed by Prof. Saagpakk.<br /><br />Unlike English, Estonian standardized written language is not very old. While an English text written 60-70 years ago doesn't look archaic to us today, Estonian has gone through major changes since Prof. Saagpakk left Estonia. Unfortunately, Mr. Saagpakk hasn't regarded those changes in his dictionary. The language you will find in this book reflects the stand of the 1930's. It contains many words and expressions that, according to today's language standard, are considered errors inadmissible even to school pupils. For a contemporary Estonian, Prof. Saagpakk's language sounds archaic, much of it takes a little thought to understand and some words are used in a pre-WWII meaning, although their meaning is different today.<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm sorry to say that this is by far the largest Estonian-English dictionary that exists, which is the reason why it's widely used even in Estonia. For us, however, the problem is not so bad - we the native speakers are able to recognize Prof. Saagpakk's mistakes and usually succeed to figure out what he actually meant by one or another weird expression. (Though we won't, of course, find newer words and expressions in this book.) Besides, a little laugh once in a while is only healthy. The foreigners, however, should use Prof. Saagpakk's \\"dictionary\\" with the greatest caution and not to be mistaken to think that this is the contemporary Estonian language. If you absolutely need to translate something from Estonian into English and you really don't have any other source for reference, go ahead and use this book, but don't count on it as the authoritative source and don't use is as a help when learning Estonian.esides, a little laugh once in a while is only healthy.

It was years ago, when I didn't  know that that ape Schwarzenegger is playing Conan in the films.  (YUCKKK!)<br />Though the book is officially number 30-something in the  series, you don't need to read the previous volumes. In fact, the numbers  of the books in Conan series don't match the chronological order and all  novels are separately readable.<br />The Conan series plays in a fictional  past when the continents had a form different from today, vaguely  resembling today's continents. In those pre-ancient countries, technique  was somewhere in the medieval level and it was possible to use magic. Conan  was a very skilled fighter of extreme strength who's adventures of  different kind are described in the series. In this novel, an evil mague  rediscovers a long-forgotten way of controlling the dead and is attempting  to get the whole world under his power. But he faces unexpected  complications when Conan gets accidentally involved in the whole  mess.<br />Conan The Defiant is my favorite Conan book so far. In my opinion,  the later books tend to be better than the earlier ones. The first  twenty-something volumes have been written quite a long time ago and are  just average reading.	2000-09-13

Okay, he has a very strong  message, but then, his writing skills are non-existent. This book  completely lacks fantasy and originality. As a result, the possible appeal  of Mr. Huxley's ideas is overweighed in a hundredfold by the despise his  &quot;prose&quot; (sorry for using this word here!) makes you feel. How is  one supposed to enjoy the beauty of a wonderful landscape by a scribble of  a three-year-old? Instead of this &quot;novel&quot;, Mr. Huxley should have  written a short newspaper article titled &quot;Things I Don't  Like&quot;.<br />If Mr. Huxley is a writer, anybody who talks is a linguist.  Reading this book leaves one perplexed - how could the author voluntarily  expose himself to such ridicule?	2000-09-04

This kind of approach doesn't always scare me off  more, but it's definitely not encouraging either.<br />At the first glance,  one could say that this is just what the authors are doing in this book.  The message of the book is very clear from the beginning - go out and do  it. On the other hand, however, this book is incredibly motivating. I  really can't tell you how they do it, but the more I read the book, the  more I started to feel the readiness to go into situations that would  normally have scared the hell out of me. I noticed a significant attitude  change in a few days. <br />It's still much less than what I would need, but  at least it's some kind of a beginning. Though this book doesn't contain a  final solution to your shyness, it's the only book I've seen that has been  of any kind of help at all. I advise every shy person to try this book  first. Maybe you're also interested to know that several other books by  Eric Weber I have seen (including the don't-know-why famous How to Pick Up  Girls) are quite useless, failing to deliver what is promised.	2000-08-24

The Communists consider it a kind of a  bible. It's truely amazing, because when you read it, you can't help  noticing that only people of very low intellect are able to write such  text. I'm not talking about the acceptability of ideas. I've read books  that make me seethe with rage. The Communist Manifesto doesn't. It's  disjointed babble. Even if you hate Communism as much as I do, this book  won't make you angry.

I have never seen a Communist work of such incapability.	2000-08-23

You can't be taken seriously in any SF discussion if you aren't familiar  with the great Foundation.<br />Isaac Asimov is, of course, a very skilled  writer. Most SF writers allow themselves embarrassing blunders that make  their universes physically absurd. In this book, you're not likely to find  anything like that. To really appreciate Mr. Asimov's genius, you should  read other SF novels written in the same time. Nearly all of them look  ridiculous in the year 2000. Mr. Asimov's books don't.

Sure, if you are getting as large an amount as 2002 dating tips in one book, you can't expect them all to be gems. But if everything is rubbish, you have a right to say that the authors have done a lousy job.<br />Here are  a few random examples of the fabulous creations of Ms. Haynes's and Mr.  Edwrads's geniality:<br />Flirt only with each other. Whisper sweet nothings.  Form a romantic poetry society. Sing Auld Lang Syne at midnight. Sit side  by side on a park bench and watch the world go by. Teeter-totter an evening  away. Take a taxi around your city to see the sights. Restore an antique  car together. Discuss current events. Cure each other of the  hiccups.<br />After browsing this truly amazing &quot;book&quot;, I spent two  minutes looking around in my room and lo - a dozen super hot dating tips  popped into my head: look out of the window together, scratch your noses  together, play a computer game together, try to break a pencil in two  together, clean up your room together, clean up her room together etc  etc.<br />Wow!

It's a rather short book that consists of made-up stories about administrative and business hierarchies. Some (if not all) of them are  based on true events. Mr. Peter has given his characters funny names and  the stories make you laugh frequently, but actually the message of the book  is very serious. Mr. Peter demonstrates that endless climbing higher and  higher is bound to lead your life into a dead end.<br />The book's fun to read  and, in my opinion, delivers really valuable knowledge. It helps you to  stand hold to the pressure from the environment that is telling you that  when you are not successful with something, you just need to keep trying  harder and investing more. Mr. Peter helps you realise why this won't  work.<br />I have heard that some US government institutions are actually  applying Mr. Peter's discoveries in their organization.<br />If you liked  &quot;Parkinson's Law&quot;, you'll enjoy this book as well.

This is the first novel in the Gray Death trilogy that starts the greatest achievement in science fiction - Battletech. It's a series playing in a long future when the known human universe is divided between five  superpowers engaged in a constant struggle for dominance. The main  characteristic of the Battletech universe is the use of a new form of  superior war machines called the BattleMech's. The BattleTech novels are  stories about MechWarriors - men and women who operate those devastating  metal giants.<br />The BattleTech universe's social structure is some kind of  neo-feudalism, and in the new kind of warfare, individual courage,  cleverness and performance are of great importance. The five superpowers  resemble of certain nations of today's Earth and have very different  political orders and ideologies. &quot;Decision at Thunder Rift&quot; is  the book you should start the lecture of BattleTech with.

Mr. Davidson is so different from the brainless Libertarian preachers. He's neither a remote-from-life storyteller like  Mary Ruwart or a narrow-minded fanatic like Ayn Rand. Mr. Davidson doesn't  moralize. (In fact, this book might help you realize why some of the  extremist Libertarians' proposals are just plain stupid.) He's not ranting  and raving and gnashing his teeth while whining over the tax money taken  away by the Big Bad Government. He's analyzing human history with unbiased,  cold rationality and explains you what's going on in the world with a  killing logic that'll blast you off the chair. <br />At least, that applies to  the first half of the book. I don't know if Mr. Davidson got tired of  writing, but somehow he loses his cold rational reason in the second half.  First, he's getting emotional about his subject. Expressions like  &quot;rapacious governments&quot; and &quot;predatory taxes&quot; start to  disturb you again and again. Second, Mr. Davidson begins to widen his  analysis onto things he hasn't got a clue about. His concept of languages,  for instance, is incompetent and pitiful, even considering that he's an  English speaker. I'm not going into details because that's not the purpose  of this review. But my advice to Mr. Davidson would be to stick to the  areas of his expertise. When you're good at something, it doesn't mean that  you're good at everything.<br />The book, as it is, is by no means convincing.  After reading it, I have lots of questions I'd like to ask Mr. Davidson.  Also, his writing style could be better. He could have cut the innumerable  useless repetitions and given better arguments instead. Still, Mr.  Davidson's theory is by far the most plausible explanation of the human  history and the second most credible future prediction I know.<br />After  reading all the reviews on this page, you might be confused and wonder if  Mr. Davidson's right or wrong. Well, that's not really the point. It  doesn't matter if you agree with him or not - he'll bring connections to  your attention you have never thought of before. It's not important if Mr.  Davidson predictions prove to be right or wrong - they're one possible  cause of actions that you should take into consideration while planning  your future.<br />&quot;The Sovereign Individual&quot; is something I call  &quot;a useful legend&quot;. It enhances your thinking, no matter if it's  true or not. If you want to take your future into your own hands, your  chances to succeed are greater if you are informed about Mr. Davidson's  theory. However, if you're just another Libertarian cry-baby, this book  might prove hazardous to your sweet black-and-white illusions.<br />Finally,  I'm sorry to tell you that the last chapter of the book really sucks. Can  you believe that Mr. Davidson is actually starting to preach Christian  morality? I thought I was going to subscribe to his newsletter, but now I'm  not so sure about it. I consider it dangerous to take financial advice from  people who are blinded by morality. So, I decrease my 5-star-rating by one  star and close the book very confused.	2000-07-12

You must have read the first volume (Lilith, the Snake in the Grass) in order to understand what it's all about.<br />If, after Lilith, you think you know  quite well what the Warden Diamond's alike, you are mistaken. The physics  of Cerberus is completely different from Lilith's. Perhaps it's even more  obscure (Lilith somehow made more sense to me). Anyway, our friend is out  there with a different face, yet with the same mission, and you're in for  some real surprises.<br />I'm sorry to say that the book is by far not as good  as Lilith (which is one of my all-time favorites). Still, it's a series  worth reading. It is imperative to read the books in the correct order  (Lilith, Cerberus, Charon, Medusa), otherwise you'll be very confused and  miss most of the enjoyment.	2000-07-05

When he begins to chase the hacker, he eventually finds out that  it's not just some youth having fun reading other people's files. And you  are going to hold your breath while following the administrator's every  move.<br />The book's well written and funny. Its philosophy is somewhat  anarchist, as is usual for computer freaks, and pretty ironical towards the  US government institutions. I'm glad to say that the hero, looking like  just another leftist jerk in the beginning, goes through a significant  attitude change when he realizes that there are countries much more evil  than the United States of America.	2000-06-15

The book is pretty similar to &quot;Shogun&quot; by the same author. In fact, if you want to know about the mood and philosophy in  &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; and my opinion about it, you can as well read my review  for &quot;Shogun&quot; and substitute the word &quot;Chinese&quot; for  &quot;Japanese&quot;. Even the reason why I didn't give the book the full  five stars is the same.<br />Mr. Clavell's expertise and accuracy for details  is astonishing. He really has very deep knowledge of 19th century China,  the way the Chinese people behaved and thought. Exactly as deep is,  unfortunately, his ignorance of foreign names. Imagine a Russian called  Zergejev or a Norwegian called Orlov! I'm really stunned by this incredible  sloppiness.<br />In despite of this flaw, I consider Mr. Clavell one of the  best skilled writers ever. His detailed description of different cultures'  interaction is extemely educational. Especially enjoyable in this book was  the realistic presentation of different English dialects.  &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; is a book that can't be translated without losing most  of its expression.<br />If you have any interest in historic fiction, make  sure you read this book. If you want to know whether you should start with  Taipan or Shogun, I really can't tell. If I had to pick one, I'd rather  advice Shogun for the first lecture. If you're reading a translation, your  only reasonable choice is Shogun.	2000-06-07

That's what this book's like.<br />The book tells a story of a man who, despite of his tremendous professional  success, feels empty and unhappy. He meets a professor who introduces to  him a way of becoming an On-Purpose Person - finding a purpose in one's  life.<br />Sounds great, you say. There, that's the golden beaker I was  talking about. The actual contents of the book are very banal. The first  sixty-something pages are dedicated to a vague presentation of a most  primitive goal setting and selection system: 1. write down all the things  you want that you can think of; 2. choose the things you want most. And  yes, Mr. McCarthy actually manages to waste sixty pages on that! Of course,  this shouldn't make you think that he's very thorough or detailed or  something. Roughly 80 % of his text is just the hero driving around and  hearing how good the new system is and thinking how happy he feels. In the  remaining 20 %, Mr. McCarthy actually describes the system in a very wordy,  but unfortunately not at all in a systematic or comprehensive way. The  system itself contains nothing new, compared to the one presented by  Raymond Hull in his book How To Get What You Want thirty years ago. I've  been doing things like that for years, I kept writing want lists,  prioritizing them, reaching my goals - and still feeling empty and  purposeless. Mr. McCarthy's book was of no help at all.<br />Well, I was  talking about the first sixty pages. The rest of the book isn't much  better. Our friend meets more and more people who tell him how happy they  are, having found the purpose in their lives. You'll also hear a number of  stories about famous people who's lives had purposes - Mother Theresa seems  to be the author's special favor. The advice-to-blubber ratio decreases  while the book progresses, then the book is over and you are left wondering  what the heck wasit all supposed to mean.<br />To sum up, the book can be  considered almost worthless. You'll learn to set goals but you won't learn  how to find out what really matters to you. If you haven't read ANY  self-help books before, you might get something out of it. Yet, to really  learn the goal-setting system Mr. McCarthy is trying to present in this  book, you should read Mr. Hull's book I mentioned (if you succeed to find  it). If you want to find your purpose, however, it will be hard for me to  suggest anything - I am left pretty clueless by this book that I hoped  would help me. However, Harry Browne's &quot;How I Found Freedom in an  Unfree World&quot; just might provide you some kind of a start. One part of  it is dedicated to that very subject and he presents three general  techniques for trying to find out your purpose. (Be sure, however, to read  the reviews carefully to decide if the book is compatible with your  principles.)	2000-04-28

So you have to read that book first, or you'll miss most of the fun here.<br />Now, other than volume 1 which consisted of several  stories building up on each other, this is one continuous novel. I'm sorry  to say that it somehow seems as if Mr. Pratchett had taken too large a  bite. The first half of the book is just as fun as volume 1. Then, however,  it gets a little long-drawn and somewhat dull. The ending is, again,  magnificent - quite worthy of Terry Pratchett.<br />This is a definite  must-read for Diskworld fans.

The conditions on Medusa are totally different from  Lilith, Cerberus and Charon, as well as the plot and the fate of our hero.  You won't get bored, that's for sure.<br />Of course, when the fourth mission  is over, the Confederation agent, as you might have expected, puts all four  reports together and sets about solving the mystery behind it all. Read the  book to see what happens. <br />&quot;Medusa&quot; is not a bad book, but it's  far from reaching the level of &quot;Lilith&quot;.

It's terrible. I can't reveal you the plot, but the magnificent philosophy of the first book is completely reversed in  this volume. I have neither read this book for a second time nor felt any  wish to read the following ones. If I only had finished after &quot;The  Glass of Dyskornis&quot;!	2000-04-17

The life of a group of Arctic explorers gets very complicated when they get unexpected visitors. This is actually all you need to know about the plot, because the less you know in  advance, the more you will enjoy the book. <br />Mr. MacLean most certainly  knows what he's writing about. Each little detail is in its place and  everything is credible. Actually, a friend told me that the book was so  realistic that he felt cold all the time he read the book. <br />Mr. MacLean  also knows how to tell an exciting story. This book's definitely not moving  on a straight line - you'll really have no chance of guessing which ones  are the good and which ones the bad guys, and how it all ends. Just the  ending seemed to me a bit hasty and Hollywood-like. That's why I'm not  giving the book more than four stars.	2000-04-12

Mainly, the book deals with the victorious anti-tax movement in California in the beginning of 70's, but Mr. Jarvis also shares much more of his rich life experience with us. Among other, we'll learn how Mr. Jarvis successfully fought the trade  unions' sabotage during WWII. The different subjects are in approppriate  proportions and presented in a very interesting style. Even though I'm  rather ignorant and uninterested of US inner politics, I found the book  really fascinating.<br />I have just one advice to the readers of this book.  The idea of forcing the hated clique of parasite politicians and civil  servants on their knees might seem very attractive to you. However, I read  lately that both Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann got killed under mysterious  circumstances shortly after their triumph with the tax proposal. I don't  know if it's true or not, but my advice would still be to avoid confronting  governments openly. (Read &quot;How I Found Freedom in an Unfree  World&quot; by Harry Browne to learn more about this subject.)	2000-04-03

Though the reviews could contain more information and less of the reviewers' personal opinions, they're still informative enough and give  you a pretty good idea of what the films are about.<br />The authors claim the  book lists all the films available on the (UK) market at that time. It  might well be true. I have found only one film that is not listed.<br />What's  not so great are the registers at the end of the book. Their really  inefficient. Still, even as it is, the keyword register enabled me to find  a few films which's titles I didn't know. However, the film databases on  the Web possibly enable one to get same results with much less effort.<br />I  have really no idea how good this book is when compared to other film  guides. But I have every reason to believe that the later issues of the  same guide are better than this particular one. I haven't bought any,  however, because this one is good enough for me. <br />The book would  definitely deserve five stars, if there weren't things like the Internet  Movie Database. These days, I really don't see why anybody would need a  film guide on paper.	2000-03-30

It begins very much like Cerberus. On the one hand, the repetions in the beginning are a bit annoying, on the other hand, they are in complete accordance with the series' logic. Anyway, you shouldn't read the book without having read the  first two volumes - Lilith and Cerberus. If you read this one first, my  guess is that you'll miss about 75 % of the enjoyment. This review, too, is  for those who have read the first two books.<br />Now, if you've come so far  with the series, you surely want to know how the story goes on, so go ahead  and read Charon and Medusa, too. In my opinion, Charon's a little better  than Cerberus, but no match for the magnificent Lilith. Mr. Chalker is as  stupidly PC as ever, and again, the end is very abrupt and confusing, but  on the other hand, Mr. Chalker cleverly avoids repeating himself and  manages to completely surprise you, again.<br />For Diamonds' fans only.	2000-03-24

The totalitarianism described in the book is very different from every-day life in Socialist countries while not lacking some  coincidental similarities.<br /><br />You are going to see a totalitarian regime  through the eyes of a small party official. You'll get introduced to his  every-day life and work, and see him starting to have strange thoughts that  he's actually not supposed to think.<br /><br />Orwell's world is much worse than  the Soviet Union ever was. I must warn you that some very brutal scenes are  described in detail and are really hard to take. The end is very Orwellian  - too abrupt and somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />The movie was pretty good, too.	2000-03-17

However, Mr. Harris apparently bit off more than he could chew. Incapable of dealing with the subject, he has  wasted his great idea.<br />First, like nearly all English/American WWII books  and films I have seen, the book's in full compliance with the Anglo-Saxon  Rules of German Names:<br />1. No German name has more than six letters.<br />2.  No German name has more than two syllables.<br />3. If a person happens to  have a name that doesn't comply with Rules 1 and 2, he is addressed  exclusively by a nickname that does.<br />All you Satterthwaites and  Fotheringays out there - if you write a book about Germany, please, please,  please buy at least one German book or newspaper or anything, to be able to  give your characters at least some names that look realistic!<br />This is, of  course, a minor matter. The main problem is that Mr. Harris is completely  ignorant of the subject he's writing about. Can you imagine that his  post-world Europe includes a state called Yugoslavia! And, of course, the  Germans couldn't subdue the mighty castle of Socialism - the German-Soviet  war is still going on in 1965. Pathetic!<br />Though the book is amazingly  poorly written, it might be worth reading because of the brilliant idea. Or  it may not. It depends on how big your interest on the subject is.	2000-02-21

(And if you haven't read that book, don't even think of reading this one!) You'll meet the same old Decius Caecilius Metellus  struggling with complicated intrigues in the capital of the world - Rome.  <br />This volume was a bit disappointing when I read it for the first time.  (Yet, it got much better with the second try.) It's not as good as  &quot;SPQR&quot;, but, of course, the latter is nearly impossible to beat.  But to look at the bright side, I'd like to mention that this time, Decius  is not acting as stupidly as in the first volume. Besides, you might be  pleasantly surprised to discover some new things about him that you  wouldn't have guessed before.<br />If you loved &quot;SPQR&quot;, read this  book and the following ones, too.	2000-02-18

Weirdest things start to happen when Satan with his assistants appears in Moscow. The bureaucrats of the Socialist state just can't handle  the confusion that results and a good laugh is guaranteed for you.     Back  in the 80s, I described the contents of the book as \\"the triumph of  the Dark Forces in the capital of Materialism\\". But they don't just  mess up things - some victims of the Soviet state are actually helped out  of their hopeless situations.    This book is better read in original than  translated. If you are fluent in Russian, you better invest some time and  money into finding a Russian version. (I lately found one on the Net.) You  won't be sorry.    One thing you should note, too, is that there are two  versions of the novel. The version released in the Soviet Union was a  censored one. It lacks a few phrases here and there and one whole chapter.  The original version was published by Russian emigrants in France or  Germany or something. When buying a translated copy, you might want to take  a look at the title page to see which version it was translated from.	2000-01-03

(Of course, the magnificent TV series has set the standard very high.) Considering that, Della Van Hise's book isn't actually the worst. If  you're a Star Trek fan, it's absolutely worth reading. Just don't expect  the kind of enjoyment you're getting from the TV series.    The book deals  with a kind of reality distortion. You may find it interesting to see some  familiar Star Trek characters in somewhat unusual situations. I don't want  to tell you any more right know, just read and see for yourself.    If  you're not a fan of Star Trek, my guess is that this book offers you nothing. A person not familiar with Star Trek background would probably find it just boring.	1999-12-28

What I would like to tell you about is the style the book's been written in.<br />Suppose, you're afraid of, say, flying. You're  scared that the plane would crash. When you'd ask Mr. Shefsky for help, he  would probably tell you something like this:<br />&quot;Well, you're afraid of  flying because you've heard all the terrible stories about airplane crashes  with tens of people killed. Never mind, just get on that airplane. Sure,  something may gone wrong with the plane. It may fall down and you may be  sitting there helpless among the other panicked passengers, unable to do  anything about the accident. Eventually, the plane would crash on the  ground and everybody would get killed. So you're dead. What's the big deal?  Don't be afraid of it.&quot;<br />And if you're still not convinced, he might  tell you the following story:<br />&quot;You know, there was a guy in New York  called John Smith. He needed to get to Los Angeles, but he was afraid of  flying. He got on the airplane anyway, flew to Los Angeles and nothing  happened to him. Since then, he has beein flying from NY to LA and back  tens of times and he never had an accident.&quot;<br />After that, Mr. Shefsky  would start to tell you five more stories like this, but you probably  wouldn't be listening to him anymore.<br />The book's surprisingly feeble. It  delivers some useful information but most of it is pretty trivial. I mean,  if you don't already know the things Mr. Shefsky is telling, then you have  a very long way to go. Actually, the book's so poorly written that it  doesn't even deserve to be called bad. You know, bad books are the ones  that make me angry or depressed. &quot;Entrepreneurs Are Made Not  Born&quot; didn't awake any emotions in me. It's like a casual conversation  with no content, structure or purpose. After finishing the book, I just  wondered if Mr. Shefsky was trying to say something.	1999-12-27

It was, however, written after the Foundation book itself. There's nothing wrong if you read &quot;Foundation&quot; before you read  this one. In fact, I recommend you to do so. You don't need to know what  happened in the &quot;Prelude...&quot; in order to understand  &quot;Foundation&quot;, but I'm not quite sure about the contrary.<br />This  book is, of course, a must-read to all Foundation fans. It's indeed very  well written. Asimov's concept of the situation on Trantor is very original  and, at the same time, quite credible. The book might well give you  something to think about. It is, of course, very exciting and eventful as  well - just what you'd expect form Asimov.	1999-12-22

I sure got some. Unfortunately, most of the book is just stupid (and partially incompetent!) ranting which is anything but funny.<br />Reading  this lampoon, I expected the author of the book to be an old frustrated  jerk who sees the life passing him by and every twelve-year-old doing  things he has no chance of ever learning. I was amazed to find out that Mr.  Ainsley has actually been dealing a lot with computers and Internet. I  wonder why he is so embittered.<br />If your friend has the book, go ahead and  take a look at it. But it's by no means worth spending money on.	1999-12-15

However, being pretty desperate about my health, I decided to give Mrs. Carter's book a try - what could I  lose, anyway?<br />Though I found out that reflexology will not work wonders,  ie. bring immediate complete healing, I was suprised to see that it had  indeed some beneficial effects on my health. I had really bad digestion  problems. Massaging the stomach and colon reflexes provided some very quick  relief and my digestion is actually improving slowly. I also had slight  potency problems, so I started to massage several sex reflexes. I have  noticed an obvious improvement in my sexual performance. I have also  noticed that massaging the heart reflexes provides some very quick help. I  haven't yet noticed any results with my eye problems. I still have lots of  work to do with my health, but Mrs. Carter's book gave me a pretty good  start.<br />It was an excellent idea of Mrs. Carter to include other kinds of  advice than just reflexology in her book . For instance, she introduces a  yoga exercise for instantly curing a sore throat. It doesn't heal your  throat completely in an instant as Mrs. Carter claims, but sometimes it's  still a great help.<br />Of course, this book is no substitute for your  brains. If you'd take Mrs. Carter's advice dead-seriously, you'd have to  spend 24 hours a day massaging your reflexes. Her book seems to be directed  on retired persons who have nothing to do all day long anyway. She also  prates very much about God, love etc. Please don't let this keep you from  reading this wonderful book. Forgive the old lady her little weaknesses.  This book is so good that a few flaws that are in it aren't really  disturbing at all.	1999-12-09

They guard its flickering light  as if they were the modern-day inheritors of an ancient religion, today's  high priests of materialism. They have the power of life and death over  entire communities; they can snuff out a struggling business with a  telephone call; they find the funds for take-overs, hostile and friendly  alike. These men see themselves as the quintessential capitalists, putting  money at risk for any venturesome idea all the way from a new car through a  new company to a needy country.\\"    On the next pages, Mr. (or should I  say Comrade?) McQueen continues in the same style, mainly lamenting over  the terrible fate of various people who couldn't pay back their loans.  The book's filled with bitterness and hatred towards those who have more  money than we the common mortals.    The author could have made a great  career with a Communist newspaper.	1999-12-02

(&quot;Prelude to  Foundation&quot; is recommended, too.) If you haven't, please don't  continue reading this review.<br />This book starts with an inner-political  conflict in Terminus, which leads to a young adventurer's leaving of  Foundation and heading to a mysterious planet which just might provide an  answer to a problem he badly needs to solve. What he finds there, lies  completely beyond any man's recognition and I won't even try to give you a  preview of it. You will be fascinated while watching closely the surprising  moves of different Galactical forces trying to outcompete each other.<br />The  book is everything a Foundation fan would expect. Surely, Mr. Asimov's  enthusiasm about a Galactic central goverment seems a bit out of date at  the end of the 20th century, but that's not really disturbing. Though the  book is not quite good as &quot;The Second Foundation&quot;, it can be  considered as a worthy follow-up.	1999-12-02
