The last two novels, Personal Injuries and Laws of our Fathers, were horrible and I didn't finish either one. This time, I waited until the paperback came out and decided to give him one LAST chance. This book was much better than the two previous ones, but still not at the level of his earlier books, Presumed Innocent and Burden of Proof, which I loved! I'll wait for his next one, but maybe only in paperback.	2004-01-28
US	53033776	R17XJRKPMSWHZT	0385508042	106527389	The King of Torts	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Disappointed again	I read this book very quickly, not because it was a real suspenseful page turner, but because I kept thinking that surely the next page would be better than the last - when is something going to happen? This book was so predictable to me - Clay was a struggling PD with a snobbish girlfriend and even more snobbish future in-laws. He became filthy rich, through less than honest means, and embarked on a journey that had a inevitable ending. It was just a matter of time before he began losing everything and I wasn't disappointed in that respect. I will probably wait to buy his next book on the bargain rack or in paperback.	2003-02-13

It was 654 pages, but could have been about 354. If Mr. Carter was paid by the word, he sure is rich!! I was determined to finish, and I'm glad I did, but I hope his next book is a little less wordy. Good plot and good finish, but way too much detail.	2002-08-20

I recommend this book to anybody that likes a good thriller. Unlike some books that I've read lately, I didn't figure this one out until the last chapter. It was also kind of scary to think that this could really happen. I'm looking forward to his next book.	2002-03-21

Chris is my favorite weatherman on Channel 13 in Indianapolis. I'm glad he's also an author. I love mysteries, so I was intrigued when I heard that Chris had written a &quot;missing child mystery&quot;. It's a rather short book (I finished it in one day)but I really liked it.

So, I'm sad to say that this one was a disappointment. Not horrible (one or two stars), but certainly not praiseworthy either. There wasn't any reason to root for Ray - he really didn't have much of a life - and I just couldn't imagine anything improving for him as a multimillionaire. His brother left alot to be desired, even in the end. The ending was one of those that makes you go &quot;HUH? That's it?!?&quot; I hope his next gets back to what makes him a best selling author.	2002-02-13

Ann Rule is, in my opinion, the best true crime writer today. I love true crime and have read alot of different authors, but nobody is better! This is a scary story! Having been married to an abuser a long time ago, I shuddered each time I read about the abuse that Sheila suffered at the hands of her husband Allen. But the scarier part was that there were so many people that knew or suspected that Allen was plotting to kill his ex-wife and said nothing! I am looking forward to Ann Rule's next book.	2002-01-11

Another cliffhanger and we have to wait for what seems like forever before we (think we) know the outcome. I love reading this series. Mysteries are my favorite type of book, but I also love the humor and far out characters in all of these books. I found myself laughing out loud (or LOL in internet speak)at some of the descriptions and situations. Keep up the good work but please - WRITE FASTER!	2001-06-28

I enjoyed this book, it even scared me a little, but doesn't compare to Bone Collector or Empty Chair. I'm not too computer literate, so alot of the technical &quot;stuff&quot; only confused me, although the characters did a pretty good job of explaining. I would buy his next novel, though, hoping it's as good as some of his earlier work.	2001-05-22

I would read and read and think I had the plot twists figured out and then, BAM, another surprise. However, I agree with an earlier review that Ashley could have been omitted, or at least had a much smaller part. She really didn't add much, except for Frank, of course. But other than that, I would highly recommend this book. I'd never heard of Stephen Horn before this, but I will certainly be on the lookout for any other books he writes in the future.	2001-05-02

I read it over a weekend and had to force myself to put it down to do my &quot;domestic&quot; stuff! One thing I love about James Patterson is his short chapters. Also, I have always loved the Alex Cross series, but was anxious to read this book that introduced us to four new characters that form the Women's Murder Club. I love a book that has alot of twists and turns, and this one is no exception. I was convinced it was #$%^ when it really was !@#$, but then it turned out to be $%^&amp;. WOW!! I'm ready for the second meeting of the Women's Murder Club!!	2001-03-19

I agree that it's quite different than his regular thrillers, but I really liked it. I wasn't bored at all, although quantum anything is a mystery to me. It was interesting reading each individual character's life wondering how soon they would all come together or why all of their lives were intertwined. I don't think I have ever read a Dean Koontz book that I didn't like, but this one was an original!! Keep up the good work!!	2001-01-25

Patterson's books, and this one was no exception. I was taken in immediately and didn't want to put it down. The process of confirmation was very interesting and makes me wonder how much of the back room dirty dealings actually go on. Probably more than we, the voters, ever know about!! The process that Mary Ann had to go through to get an abortion for a &quot;nonviable&quot; fetus was horrible, at best. Regardless of your politics or stand on abortion, this is an excellent book. I look forward to his next book.	2001-01-19

I really  like medical thrillers, and this is one of the better ones. (However, I  figured out what was going to happen to her mother about 5 pages after her  new &quot;babysitter&quot; arrived.) Toby was an interesting character and  I can't imagine what it would be like to work the graveyard shift in an ER  in addition to being the caregiver for a mother with Alzheimers. Talk about  stress!! I plan to read her previous medical thriller and look forward to  her next.	2000-08-04

I admit, this wasn't a real thriller type mystery, but it was very easy to read and I enjoyed it. So much, in  fact, that I ordered all eight of her previous books. I plan to start with  the first and read straight through to this one. It should be quite a  trip!	2000-07-27

I'm always on the lookout for new authors and will probably read  more books by this one.	2000-04-13

I would like to read all of  the prior Jane Whitefield novels to get to know her a little more (why she  does this, where she and her husband met, etc.). Near the end, I just  wanted the book to end - the last leg of their trip seemed to go on  forever. I will read more of Thomas Perry's books.	2000-03-16

However, I finished it in less than a week and didn't want to put it down. I didn't think John's relationship with Kate was completely out of character. Sometimes love just &quot;hits&quot; you and  that's it. Also, I didn't think the ending was weak, as others have said.  It does &quot;smell&quot; like a sequel, though. I'm looking forward to his  next novel.	2000-02-04

I only got halfway through his last book before I gave up. This one I got about 3/4 through before saying to myself &quot;Enough already&quot;. I agree with one person  who said Turow's habit of using charters first, then last, then full name  to be very confusing. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never  did as far as I was concerned. I have given up on this author. I refuse to  buy anymore of his books.	1999-11-28

It was a good book, but didn't have the smooth writing style of Lawrence Sanders. I really was saddened when he died,  because the world lost a wonderful writer. So, needless to say, I was quite  surprised when I found this book in the &quot;Not yet published&quot; part  of Amazon. When I found out it wasn't really written by Sanders, I was  leary in even buying it. I enjoyed it, but, like others have said, Archy  seems to be different than in the all of the previous books. This book was  just a little &quot;off&quot; from the others. Too bad.	1999-07-28

The case histories were interesting, but this guy has an ego as big as all outdoors. I also read Douglas's book and can't imagine these two ever working together. They would constantly be in the hospital having their arms set from patting themselves on the back. But I digress! I guess when your work takes you into the world of the serial killer, you deserve alot of credit. Ressler's interviews with Gacy and Dahmer made my skin crawl.

The plot kept me interested throughout and the descriptions of the slaughterhouse bothered me, but not enough to give up beef. I think there is nothing more tragic than having to bury one of your children, especially the way Kim's daughter Becky died. (By the way, the synopsis of this book says that Kim's SON gets sick and dies. Where did that come from?!?) I didn't buy the sudden reconciliation of Kim and Tracy, though, and the ending was pretty weak. All in all, it was an interesting book, a little above average, and I would buy his next book without hesitation.	1998-04-09
