That aside decided to give it a go and found that it has ebbs and tides.  There were times when I couldn't wait to get back into the novel at night because I thought the story line perplexing.  Then there were times when it seemed as though I might get sick because of forced dialogue and boring interactions.  I did think the book propelled me into the second novel without hesitation.  It is definitely a great find as I sit here and wait for a Feast For Crows.  It is not in the same league but I would rank it in my top 15 novels.	2005-10-11

Martin novel.  George Keyes has a wonderful book and I would highly recommend it to any fantasy lover, but you will see certain similarities to the graphic nature of a Martin novel, but at times the similarities are too much (in the sense that he istrying too hard).  He needs to develop the characters just a tad bit more so that when they are killed you are shocked and horrified because of the time you have spent with them.<br />I can't say anything poor about the book because it is an awesome springboard into the next novel.<br />He is in the same vein as Martin but not quite there yet (he is the closest thing we have).<br />RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND A MUST READ	2003-05-16

It is a very good read and it is very informative about the comedy show that we all grew up with.<br />I wish they would have spent more time on issues like least faorite guests and things of that nature and I wish they would have organized the book more by topic than by chronology.<br />All of the above things aside I think it is a wonderful book and would highly recommend it to all those that grew up loving SNL.  It wears long after about page 450, but it is easy up to that point.  It is full of little fights and things about the crew you never knew.<br />It really makes you want to go back and watch some of the first episodes now that you know what they were going through at the time.<br />RECOMMEDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2002-10-28

The books keep getting a little better, although I have not quite gotten use to the usage of dedicates.  It is a difficult concept to grasp as this is a kin to slavery and I can't see how the people would want to become dedicates.<br />The writing is good and he has no problems killing characters.

He has definitely worked hard at his character development and he is trying to bring his novels into a more graphic arena a la George R.R. Martine (but he has a way to go).<br />His concept for the series is quite unique, but the whole issues with endowments becomes a bit overdone towards the end of the book.  It's hard to remember who has 100 endowments and who has 1000.  I also feel like it is in a weird way difficult to swallow that someone would become a Dedicate.  I wish he would work more on the issue of dedicates and what these people have to endure.<br />What David Farland has done that Robert Jordan cannot seem to develop is the ability to write a story that takes place in a matter of days.  Farland can describe a battle scene to perfection and while I wish he were just a bit more graphic he has come to the forefront as a master in this arena.<br />It's unfortunate that there are reavers in this book because they sound like something out of cthulu mythos and should have been replaced with something a bit more energetic.<br />Here are my picks for fantasy writers:<br />1). GEORGE R.R. MARTIN<br />2). TAD WILLIAMS<br />3). DAVID FARLAND<br />4). ROBERT JORDAN<br />RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SERIES	2002-09-10

I have to say to the critics before me that they need to take this book more for concept and less for writing.  The entire concept of this book is awesome and I must say is more than likely being critcized by christians blasting the book for other reasons.<br />In her book Alice Sebold gives us alook at apossible heaven, and in so doing has probably summoned the christian-right to their battle stations.  Her heaven is by no means a catechism class, but her ideas are fresh and bold and need to be taken for what they are...FICTION.<br />The book has some dry spells, but she keeps you going.  I wish she would have gone more into the murder and murderer, but alas, we cannot have it all.<br />Read the first sentence and tell me if you want to read this book.

It is much more compelling than either of the first two novels and it definitely leaves no question that you want to read the series finale.<br />It takes some time to get through this one just like iot takes time to get through the other two in the series, but this novel is better paced and filled with the same imaginative situations.<br />RECOMMENDATION: A MUST READ FOR TAD WILLIAMS FANS	2002-06-01

This book has several similarities and is fascinating.<br />I have to admit that it took me two tries to get into this book.  I wanted to like this series because I really enjoyed Memory, Sorrow and Thorn.  On my second try through this bulky text I discovered that Tad Williams has to be one of the best authors with regards to creativity and character development to come around in years.<br />The way he takes you through the different sim worlds is wonderful and the characters are so very believable.  He also has a great dialogue that keeps the pace of the book.  So many authors in fantasy or Sci-fi are too much into the same ol' thing when it comes to dialogue and this book gives williams a way to be different, because in Otherland, anything goes.<br />This book is very complex and sometimes you need to write down a timeline to keep track of where the characters are as you might forget.  It is a novel that jumps between scenes which at times is difficult, but you catch on to the style.<br />Williams, at times, may be verbose in his descriptions of scenes and it may slow things down at times, but overall this is a wonderful book and something that I think should place him way at the head of this genre.<br />RECOMMENDATION: CLASSIC - SHOULD BE IN YOUR COLLECTION	2002-05-14

Martins last book and have been going through a dry spell until I happened on Mr. Coe's book.<br />The worst thing about this book is the cover.<br />Some of the ideas and the characters are very similar to other writers, but his development of the families and such is very unique and his manner of writing and dialogue are wonderful.  I will say that his first installment in very similar to Mr. Martin's Song of fire and ice, although it is with less violence and sexual conotation.<br />I will anxiously await the Seeds of Betrayal and hope that I can now find another novel to tide me over until Jordan, Martin, or Willimas come out with another novel.	2002-04-15

First, of all he deserves accolades for being able to create and publish seven novels.  The first two novels in this series were far and away the best and it is for the simple reason that we had stories that were not so entrenched in the &quot;love-thing&quot; of Richard and Kahlan that there were some very good, tense scenes.<br />Goodkind has lulled us into the realization that he isn't going to kill off one of the main characters a la Jordan so this seriously cuts the tension level down to nil.  Even in this book he has to have the love story with Sebastian and Jennsen which totally overrides any sort of seriousness this book had, and it did have potential.<br />I have to disagree with those that critisize for not having richard or Kahlan in the story except the last 50 pages.  I say, thank God for some new characters and thank God for a different angle on the story line.  The problem with this storyline is that it really didn't accomplish anything, and the best character in the book (Oba), probably wont be making a return.  The reason I say Oba is the best character this series has seen is because he is true high fantasy epic character.  He embodied the evil nature that we expect from this type of a person.  when Goodkind wrote with Oba you could sense this anger and release and I enjoyed the author coming through.<br />I think it is time for Goodkind to move away from the love stories because they are killing the characters and killing the series.  It is simply too boring to read about how everyone loves everyone else.  He also needs to start having some main characters die off or else the thing will stay utterly predictable as it already has been for the last five books.<br />Overall I am disappointed with the last five books and I doubt will be buying the next one.  Oh, who am I kidding, I will because I read the first seven and I have to finish it...damn.<br />RECOMMENDATION: DONT EXPECT MUCH AND YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED..damn.<br />RECOMMENDATION: DONT EXPECT MUCH AND YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED	2001-12-24

Now she has changed the title but the whining is all the same.  The reason I give this book a one star is because I'm sick and tired of these people that join the LDS church and then go and blame it for all of their woes.  I joined the church too and found out it was way too weird and was excommunicated, but I have since gotten on with my life and dont feel the need to blame others for my poor decisions.  The second reason this book is horrible is because it is written for second graders.  She needed to have someone help her write the text so that it came off with the drama that she was looking for.  Look Judy, you joined, they didn't make you, and then you write a book about how horrible the experience was (get a grip).  The third reason I think this book is horrible is that in order to make more money (yeah she wants to keep people out of the religion, but a few bicks wouldn't hurt), she changed the title and put it out again.  I have to give her credit for knowing how to make a buck, but she is preying on the same type of weak personalities that she is claiming the mormons preyed on when they grabbed her.<br />Buy this book for your kids if they have mormon friends because they will get the gestalt, but read something more literary like history or Fawn Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith.<br />RECOMMENDATION: STOP LINING HER POCKETS WITH YOUR MONEY.	2001-12-24

The intial book in this series &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; was indeed a good book and a good place to start, but I thought it was a bit slow and dragged a bit a times too concerned with the development of characters too unimportant.  Throughout this epic conglomeration, Williams, at times has so much going on inside his head that he rushes himself and deosn't really explain things.  I realize that Green Angel Tower is &gt; 1,000 pages, but I hate it when plots are divulged in the last 4 pages when they could have been slowly released at different times in the book.  Overall I would rank this trilogy right up there with Jordan only Tad Williams knows when to quit and doesn't carry the series out for 10 novels like Jordan.  This book is one of those that gets better every page you turn and that starts from page one of the first book.  Williams has a knack for the dramatic yet his characters are very believable.  I didn't care for his Otherland series, but I must say that if he ever goes back to this type of fantasy I will be the first in line.<br />RECOMMENDATION: CLASSIC, MUST READ FOR ALL COLLECTORS	2001-12-17

I thought the author took the specific cases such as the Menedez brothers and brought forth compelling evidence against them but I think he could have done a much more crucifying job.<br />He really spent a lot of time on the O.J. case and while it was the most televised spectacle in recent years I don't think he needed to spend that much of the book on O.J., and he really didn't do a whole lot breaking down O.J. and his story as much as he went after the dream team of lawyers.<br />Overall a very good book and I think it is a look into the way the system works or doesn't work.<br />RECOMMENDATION:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2001-10-04

In the past couple novels Goodkind has gotten away from the characters and the story line , but in Faith of the Fallen he returns.<br />He stays away from the Kahlan and Richard love affair, which at times is sickening, and he concentrates more on developing the plot and the storyline.  I rather enjoyed the symbolism and the objectivism that Goodkind has portryaed in this novel.  I wonder if he has any inklings towards Ann Rynd.<br />He has developed good characters and he has a talent for developing tension at very preceise moments, when you aren't expecting it.  He is also finally becoming comfortable enought to lay waste to some of the mainstream characters which I think is a wonderful thing to do.  It shows that he is not afraid to create more characters when these become boring.<br />I cant wait for the next text out this year.<br />RECOMMENDATION:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2001-09-20

I have read the first one hundred pages of this thing thinking.....what the hell is going on here. I mean I understand the dialogue but the book is literally making me fall asleep. I know that many people have rated this with 5 stars and that is another reason why I thought I would give it a try, but I have been severely disappointed. I thought this was going to be book with strong female characters and possibly even something with a religious overtone, but the whole thing falls way short. Sure there is something of a theological aspect with the correlation to Christ but you ask yourself why. Maybe that's the problem with the book is that there is absolutely no reason for anything the author is writing about and she gives you no explanation as to what the things are that she is talking about. It's like walking into a 2 hour movie 15 minutes before the thing ends. Personally I would save the money and if you were looking for something fantastic with more of an edge and definitely easier to understand an apply then try Ayn Rand.

I'm not going to go making the connections here, but there is definitely a close comparison.<br />He also has begun to show some of Tolkien in his work, especially at the end of the book when the Gars attack the Mriswith and save the day (sound familiar).  I like his description of why the Gars came about and why they have the green eyes, but the connection to Tolkien and Jordan leaves me feeling a bit flat.<br />I am also becoming a bit tired of the relationship between Richard and Kahlan being so prominent throughout the text.  It seems as though he is trying to convince us of their love be being repetitive and it doesn't need to be done in my opinion.<br />Things about this book that I enjoy are the mriswith as I think they are a very unique character.  His character development has always been very good and he has been good at creating scenes and excitemnet in his previous two books but he falls a bit short in this book.  I think the strength of this book and the previous has been the Mord-Sith; I think the characters are wonderful but the name and the concept seem to be a repetition of other authors.<br />I have laready started Temple of the Winds because I am dedicated to finishing the series.

I see famous models and wives that are pregnant but not reflective of the general pregnant population.

I suppose if you looking into purchasing this book then you have already read the first two and thus dont need encouragement to undertake the reading of this vast novel.<br />I dont want to give anything away but the reason that Martin is so wonderful is that he spends so much time on character development yet isn't afraid to kill them off when the plot requires.  There is one particular point in the book where four of the main characters die (or do they) within about 100 pages of text.<br />I have e-mailed Mr. Martin and thanked him for the stories and characters and told him that I was going through withdrawl.  When he wrote back he said the true withdrawl wouldn't set in until I realized that the next book wouldn't be out until 2002, and he is right.<br />This book has only a few slow spots and you dont mind those so much because you know he will pick up the pace very shortly.  His characters are superb.  My favorites are Tyrion and Stannis.  He hasn't given away his plot so we are left hanging until the next book which is great.  I can wait for Jordan's next installment, but this one is going to be hard to wait for.<br />I would definitely try to collect the first editions of these books as they should definitely sit on your shelf as part of a true collection of fantasy.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - DONT MISS	2001-07-27

I have read the WOT by Jordan (all 9 volumes) and I am not easy to please.<br />I want to address some of the plagurism issues that have been brought up.  I wholeheartedly agree that many of the associations between Goodkind and Jordan have been made by Mr. Goodkind, but how many other authors have used the concepts of J.R.R. Tolkien's works.<br />I beleive Mr. Goodkind to be a blend between Jordan - because of his ability to spend some time on details and then to bring the cataclysm in a speedier fashion; and Terry Brooks - for the manner in which he can spin a tale.<br />As opposed to lovers of Robert Jordan, Goodkind's books only seem to get better.  SOT is a wonderful book that I found the story line to be very emotional and with a few twists that keep me wanting to go on.  SOT is another step in the tale of Richard Rahl and there are many other characters being introduced.<br />Try not to look at this as a Jordan purist or we can all make references to Tolkien from Jordan.

It is Heroic fantasy to be sure, but at the same time the ride is wonderful.<br />Sure there are little things here and there that you might criticize but overall I think this is a wonderful start for this new author (not new anymore).  As far as being pornographic this is about as far from pornographic as I can think (the person that wrote that better stay away from George R.R. Martin).  I cant even think of a part of this text where there was anything even remotely offensive.<br />I could hardly wait to move along to Stone of Tears.<br />The character development is wonderful and the plot is full of turns and has been well thought out by the author.<br />This should be a part of your Masterpieces of Fantasy Collection.	2001-07-09

The characters are equally believable and the plots have definitely thickened into a nice stew.  Tyrion is a wonderful character and the lines between men and women are more realistic for the time period than many other period pieces.<br />I will agree that Martin does have a thing for being descriptive with sex and that it really doesn't add a whole lot to the story.  I mean it's one thing to bring incest into the story, but another to graphically describe it.  I also still hold to my thought that he uses language that does not sound like it was part of that period.  i can't repeat the words here but they just dont fit in the story and when you come across them they stall the story a bit in my opinion.<br />I still think this book belongs a part of your Fantasy Masterpieces collection.	2001-06-25

Whereas Jordan's world is obviously more fantasy with Aes Sedai and the like, Martin's world is more realistic and almost to a fault.<br />While the book ending with you seething for more, it begins a bit slow and he jams many characters at you from the beginning.  Once you are able to digest the different people and what House they are from (around mid-book), the plot thickens and becomes difficult to put down.<br />A few problems I had with the book are the slow start, then numerous characters and the often times brutality of his description.  First of all, the characters speak in a way that is sometimes not believable (for instance using the word bunghole).  Persoanlly I also feel that there is too much emphasis on sex...not that sex offends me by any means it simply doesn't fit into the story.<br />The book is wonderful regardless of what I have said.  I cant wait to get &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;.	2001-06-18

This book I felt was much better than some of the others, however, nothing will top the first 3 book.<br />We are obviously in for a long ride as I have head that there will probably be at least another 3 if not 4 books in this series.	2001-06-18

Mr. Jordan takes us on a new weave of storylines but he dosen't do much in the over 600 pages of text.  Granted, I have only read baout the first 2/3rds of the book but we don't even have a chapter with Rand until page 281.  I don't know where he is going with this book, but you could have cut it in half and placed the first half of the book in ACOS and the last half in WInter's Heart instead of making this a separate text.<br />I am going to continue the series because of what I have invested already timewise but I wish he would get on with it already.	2001-05-19

This 7th novel actually picks up the pace again.	2001-05-16

I am serious when I say that every recipe is wonderful and easy to assemble.  There are some that have even become family staples and are made frequently.  Anyone who loves to cook should have this on their shelves.	2001-02-14

Vol. 1	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	A wonderful beginning	Remini really has done something impossible and that is take a biography and make you sorry that the book has ended. Well, actually I am rather excited that I have two more volumes of this wonderful text to read.<br />Jackson really comes across as a true american hero with a definite attitude and you gather respect for the man as he really championed our country's expansive borders.<br />If you are a history-presidential buff then you have to read this book.	2001-02-06

I thought it would be a focused look at the reason the authors thought that Napoleon was assassinated, but much of the text is actually his campaigns and political life.  It almost seems that they were trying to make the book look big by adding information that you can easily read in other texts.  I really thought this one was going to be different but it fell a little short in my opinion.	2001-01-09

The concept is amazing and while the church admits to its history of polygamy they usually skirt the issue but never really delve into the humanistic side of this horrible history.<br />As a former member of the LDS church I had never even heard the information that was presented and that is because most of this information is shielded from public eye.  I applaud the author for his writing and investigating.<br />I think this book is a must for any American History scholar.	2001-01-09

I found a real appreciation for the harshness of Adams' mother Abigail that I was unaware of and for his adversarial relationship with her.  I also think the author protrays Adams as one of our most intellectual presidents.	2001-01-09

This book is a history of power and how it works and how it can be turned  against you.  You don't have to subscribe to the policies or laws, but if  you are aware of them you might just be able to prevent people from using  them upon you.<br />Quit whining, it's just a book.	1999-10-16

I wanted there to be more of an explanation of these people, who to my generation have all but disappeared.  I loved this book.	1999-09-14
