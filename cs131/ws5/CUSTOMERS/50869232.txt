This comprehensive book covers the entire history of video games, from the first pinball machines right up to before the launch of the Gamecube and Xbox.  Telling the story from the viewpoints of the people who actually made the games happen, this book gives gamers and non-gamers alike a better appreciation of video games and the changes that they have brought to the world, even when they weren't for the better.  Strongly recommended.  I hope there will be an expansion pack someday.	2004-07-25

Being a heavy computer user, I have heard about some of the stories detailed in this book, but most of them just made my jaw drop as to how modern technology can screw up either by itself or by a human hitting the wrong button. So this book is highly recommended, but don't give it to any of your luddite friends. They'll use it to prove you right.	2004-06-28

Being someone who has seen a lot of James Bond movies, I picked up this book to see where it all started. And I have to say, I was dissapointed. The climax of the book took place right in the middle, and there was endless detail after detail after detail. And I know it was written back in 1953 and it was a different world back then, but I was shocked as to how politically incorrect it was. Spy fiction was not my thing in the first place, but I can honestly say that I'll be sticking to the movies for the forseeable future.	2004-04-25

Michael Straczynski (so you know it's official), covers the period in B5's history detailing the final years in the life of Psi Cop Alfred Bester.<br />There are many parts of the Babylon 5 story that have only been hinted at throughout the series, the Telepath War being one of the biggest. Not many questions are answered about that in this book, being that it's set after the war and it's obvious Bester was on the losing side. Now hiding out as a literary critic in Paris, Bester actually makes an effort to put all that behind him, but Michael Garibaldi is soon on his trail, not forgetting what Bester did to him long ago and is out to settle the score.<br />One thing I liked is how grounded on Earth the Psi Corps Trilogy was. There were scenes on other worlds and brief appearances by aliens, the first book briefly touching on Earth's first contact with the Centauri, but for the most part it concentrated on humans, on Earth, and how all the various peoples and factions involved dealt with &quot;the telepath problem.&quot; This book wraps up the life of the Babylon 5 villain you just love to hate, and it's a must-read.	2004-02-23

This book has a very deserved reputation for being one of the funniest pieces of Star Trek fiction ever written. Viewers and readers all know what Lwanana Troi is like, and they all know what Q is like, so just imagine the consequences if the two should meet. Star Trek writers have to be very careful when using Q, and Peter David is a master of it. I actually laughed out loud several times while reading this book, and the ending gives a whole new meaning to the saying &quot;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.&quot; Highly recommended.	2004-02-23

This book, based on an outline from Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski (so you know it's official), covers the period in B5's history detailing the continuing rule of Emperor Londo Mollari's of Centauri Prime, all while under the thumb of the Drakh.<br />As the Drakh continue the plans of the Shadows, their former masters, forces start brewing both on and off Centauri Prime once certain people learn what's going on. And the Drakh attack on Earth sure didn't help much.<br />This book continues to fill in the twenty-year gap at the end of the Babylon 5 series, and is just as riveting as the show, because we know what happens, and when, but these books explain how and why. Strongly recommended.	2004-02-23

Michael Straczynski (so you know it's official), covers the period in B5's history detailing the early life of Psi Cop Alfred Bester, from his first years being raised by Psi Corps right up to before his first visit to the Babylon 5 station.<br />There were revelations abound in this book, including details of Bester's first love, Lyta Alexander's internship with the Psi Cops, and just how Bester's hand became crippled. Let's just say, it's a big surprise.<br />The book also gives a greater look into the Bester character and after reading it you start to understand his motives for the things that he does both here and during the B5 series. Highly recommended.	2004-02-23

Initially through no fault of his own, he starts to leave behind the Flounder-ness of his character and starts to go down the path that will someday lead him to becoming Emperor himself. Strongly recommended for Babylon 5 fans.	2004-02-23

Michael Straczynski (so you know it's official), covers the period in B5's history detailing the final years of Emperor Londo Mollari's of Centauri Prime, all while under the thumb of the Drakh.<br />Bits of the future were only seen in brief glimpses during Babylon 5's run, but this book starts to bring it all together. There were so many &quot;so *that's* what was going on!&quot; moments while reading this book it is a seamless expansion to the ending of the show. Plus the liberation of Centauri Prime and the rise of Emperor Cotto wrap up this twenty-year chronicle.<br />This series of books really helped paint Londo as a tragic character, and totally redefines Vir's at the same time. If there's one constant in the universe is that things change, and the Centauri Prime Trilogy drives that home. Strongly recommended.	2004-02-23

Michael Straczynski (so you know it's official), covers the period in B5's history detailing the discovery of telepaths on Earth in 2115 and the early years of the Psi Corps.<br />I was stunned at the revelations in this book, including the appearance of the ancestors of several of B5's (in)famous telepath characters and briefly touches upon the first contact with the Centauri. But the thing that got me the most, and this is a small spoiler (but it's right at the start of the book), but the discovery of telepaths was the result of a joke. Yes, two medical students had to write and research a paper on the most outrageous topic they could think of as part of a hazing ritual, so they chose mind-reading. Imagine their surprise when they tested and found people who could actually do it.<br />Keep that in mind the next time you're watching Babylon 5 and it's an episode involving human telepaths. Sure, it would've been discovered sooner or later, but you have to appriciate the irony involved that the discovery of telepathic abilities, and all their subsequent problems, is the unintended side effect of a prank. Highly recommended.	2003-08-14

This book tells the tale of what really happened to Anna Sheridan and Morden during the Icarus' doomed expedition to the Shadow homeworld, Z'ha'dum. Plus, there's a subplot concerning Captain Sheridan trying to get the crew under his new command on the Agamemnnon into shape, and then preventing a terrorist attack on the recently completed Babylon 5 space station.<br />This book, and it's companion volume &quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows&quot;, created a feeling of dread about the Shadows and what they represent, just like on the Babylon 5 TV show. And we all know that Anna joined the Shadows, but her reasons as to why are a shocker. Strongly recommended.	2003-08-03

Fitting seamlessly into the Babylon 5 story arc, it tells the story of Jeffery Sinclair's first days as Earth's new ambassador to the Minbari, and how he came to be leader of the Rangers and later Entil'Zha. Plus, it also reveals how Marcus Cole became a ranger and what happened to Catherine Sakai.<br />I really liked how there were references and tie-ins to the stories in the B5 comic books produced by DC, and this book answers a lot of questions about them as well. Slight spoiler: In fact, after reading this book, you'll have an idea as to what Valen meant in his final message found aboard Babylon 4 in DC's mini-series &quot;In Valen's Name&quot;.<br />So if you're a Babylon 5 fan, and you haven't read this book yet, do it.

And that was the feeling that I was getting when reading this book. The Day of Honor series crosses over four Star Trek series (ST, TNG, DS9, VGR) with a central theme, being the titular Day of Honor, the most important day in the Klingon calendar where &quot;they pay homage to all that makes them Klingon.&quot; While Worf is working undercover as part of a planetary criminal network, his son Alexander is exploring one of his human ancestors on the holodeck with Captain Picard in tow. The book switches between the two locales, so there are two stories going on at the same time.<br />But as I said earlier, a lot of Star Trek fiction just doesn't appeal to me. Maybe because it just keeps getting churned out month after month you get saturated by it. And these big inter-series crossover events happen once a year as well. So I really cannot recommend this book.	2003-05-27

The rail lines and freeways have all been destroyed, so travel and trade is now only possible by air. This lead to the rise of airborne pirate gangs and the hijacking of cargo zeppelins. The North American nations responded by forming their own national air militas or contracting private companies to keep their cargo, and themselves, safe. It makes you wonder just how things would be like if history was just a little different.<br />This is a collection of three novellas, two of which were originally published on the official Crimson Skies website. Done in the style of the old pulps, each story follows one of the main Crimson Skies characters as they fly, flight, and con their way to save the day, or line their pockets their pockets in the process. Highly recommended.	2003-02-14

I didn't even finish it, because reading it felt like the piece of metal that was wedged into Spock's back.  And I know that the ST novels are set outside the regular Star Trek continuity, but the jump from Original Enterprise to first movie Enterprise in just a few months after an onboard explosion?  Give me some credit.<br />I'm planning to release my copy via BookCrossing at a movie theatre after Star Trek Nemesis opens, so I hope it'll end up with someone who'll like it more than I did.	2002-11-28

It comes with the complete play, plus side-by-side definitions of the more obscure English words used and illustrations. Also included are essays on Shakespeare, his life, Elizabethan England and so forth to help put the play in perspective. Through high school, I had to study a total of three Shakespeare plays, the other two being Midsummer Night's Dream and Macbeth, and this was the best of the bunch. And that's considering at the end of Macbeth we watched Roman Polanski's blood-soaked movie version, and the 1935 Midsummer Night's Dream movie starring a very young (read: annoying) Mickey Rooney as puck. And if you're curious, we watched Mel Gibson's Hamlet movie. Kenneth Branagh's was still a few years away and it would've taken us a whole week to sit through that.	2002-10-11

Scott Adams builds on his first non-Dilbert Dilbert book with The Dilbert Future, by predicting what the future will be like in the vein of all those other prediction and trend books. The tone is definitely tounge-in-cheek, as the book doesn't take itself too seriously with such chapters devoted to future work, voting, dating, food, and \\"Life Will Not Be Like Star Trek.\\" Too bad, I want a holodeck but as Scott says, if we had holodecks we would never leave them. The final chapter is a real mind-bender where Scott gets serious about science and the future, but the theories are so weird this could be viewed as a precursor to his other book, God's Debris. And all along the way, various Dilbert strips are used to illustrate his points. Very recommended.	2002-10-11

I wanted to pick up this book right after I heard about Kevin &quot;Tom Servo&quot; Murphy's insane experiment to see a movie a day for all of 2001. And after I got my copy, I couldn't put it down. This is not a book of movie reviews, but a book that reviews the movie-going experience. As Kevin said in his introduction, after being forced to sit through hundreds of just plain awful movies during his decade on MST3K, he had to rediscover his love of film. So he decided to see a movie a day for a whole year. He went to the local googleplexes and saw the latest Hollywood stuff, and if he saw a movie he just *hated* I could easily picture him transforming into Tom Servo, but he also travelled the world, seeing movies in Australia, Quebec, New Zealand, Sundance, and Cannes. He also performed various sub-experiments, such as sitting in the front row the whole first week, eating nothing but theater food for a week, taking six different women to the same date movie, and how to properly theater-hop and sneak in a whole Thanksgiving dinner.<br />There are some poignant moments too, such as when he brought his nephew to his first big screen movie and start his love of film, and being halfway around the world on September 11 and deciding if he should go on. It is the balance between truely touching moments like this and the stuff that just plain hilarious that makes this book great. If you're getting sick of going to the movies, get this book and want to go all over again.<br />But for for all that is good and decent in the Universe, avoid B-list star movie vehicles like Town &amp; Country.	2002-10-04
