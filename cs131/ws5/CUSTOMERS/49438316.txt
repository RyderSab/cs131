The characters that will probably become regulars in her future mysteries all have a &quot;real&quot; feel to them from the beginning. Unlike most mystery writers of today's top seller lists,, Burke doesn't resort to escalating violence or grotesgue brutality. <BR>Being the child of a man almost of current poet laureate status of popular mystery, Ms Burke holds her own with the quality of her work. Judgment Calls isn't deserving of some of the shallow criticism thrown at it. If you expect Grisham BUY Grisham. If you expect James Lee Burke BUY James Lee Burke.<BR>If you're expecting a well written mystery with developed characterizations and plot  READ Judgment Calls. If you want an entertaining read the Alafair Burke series looks to be off to a good start. I'm looking forward to future Samantha Kincaid adventures! I'm also looking forward to more Dave Robicheaux. They should both be easy to locate in the &quot;B&quot; section of the bookstore or library. I'm happy with this purchase.<BR>John Row	2004-02-15

If one is particularly interesting I can literally finish it within a few days. My genre of choice are mysteries from NY Times Best Sellers to relative unheard of or long forgotten writers. So, I was quite excited when Penquin books / Viking Press offered to send me copies of four of Mr Camilleri's mysteries which have been translated into English to read and review.<BR>Unfortunately, Andrea Camilleri's Sicilian police inspector Salvo Montalbano The Shape of Water has been almost impossible to read. The books are quite a departure from what most American mystery readers are expecting. There are several murders, no car chases, nor fist fights, nor shoot outs. That isn't necessarily why I can't say I didn't like the books.<BR>I recently read and reviewed Alexander McCall Smith's &quot;Number 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot; series, where there are no shoot outs, etc and was thoroughly entertained by the series.<BR>I think what was lacking for me from Mr. Camilleri's books were something to relate to from an investigators process in solving the main and then the subsequent crimes.  When I finally finished the book , the crime was solved and I had no idea HOW it was solved.<BR>After The Shape of Water, I know what to expect from other books in the series. I'll give the other books a shot and see if it was just me and this particular work of the author<BR>John Row	2003-12-10

Ex-chief of detectives in the Santa Fe Police department, retired by a shot-up leg, Kerney is drawn back into action when Navajo Indian Terry Yazzi, his ex-partner and the man responsible for his injuries, asks him to locate his son, reported missing from the high-security WhiteSands Missile Range in southern New Mexico.<BR>To find Sammy Yazzi, Kerney must track clues that lead deep into the histories of the region -- Native American, Hispanic,<BR>and Anglo -- and surprisingly, into his own family's ranching past.  And he must deal with the complicated feelings<BR>triggered by the army's investigator, Captain Sara Brannon, a fiery young officer as formidable as she is attractive.<BR>As Sammy Yazzi's trail spirals into a web of murder, treason, and the smuggling of priceless artefacts, Kerney and Sara<BR>travel an accelerating arc across the New Mexico scene -- from the boutique-ridden plaza of Santa Fe, through the sharp-edged beauty of the high desert, to bordertown gambling dens -- to a final confrontation in which, both wounded and at risk, they must fight for their lives and for each other against opponent who hold all the odds.<br />There are several appealing aspects to McGarrity's Kevin Kerney series. One is the spectacular background  of Sante Fe and New Mexico the author has chosen as the locale for his continuing series. You CAN pick up any of the Kevin Kerney books and without too much trouble be swept up in the strengths and weaknesses of Chief Kerney, but it is a bit easier to start with the first in the series (Tularosa) to not feel too lost in the character interaction. As you learn  through reading the series, the Kerney family has been part of this area for many generations. Tularosa sets some of the main character's into play and gives the particulars to what makes Kearney tick- Chief Kerney's being severly wounded. It introduces Air Force Captain Sara Brannon and Kerney. Which becomes an important relationship in subsequent books in the series.<BR>Most of Michael McGarrity's books can run from scenes of brutal violence to serene appreciation of the New Mexico high desert. With enough excitement running the length of the book to the fast paced ending.<BR>I've read through the entire Kevin Kerney series by Michael McGarrity. I would put Tularosa in the 4 * range. Alot of the book was used in development of the characters and such. This isn't a bad thing, in fact I think this has made the series  better for it.<br />John Row	2003-12-08

Levine gives simple exercises to help break through the web of pain so that we can go about enjoying life again. <BR>I can't  just recommend going out and buying this workbook and all your problems and pain will be gone by the time you finish reading it.

As aCaveat to the readers of this review, I was contacted by the publisher of the book and sent a free copy of Everyone Dies. My guess being that I had written reviews on books of similar ilk.Several factors entered at the time that I was asked to read the book and  review it. To be honest the publisher never intimated it was required I write a review because they sent me a book. Anyway, the major factor that I felt  kept me from writing a review worth the book's good and bad points adequately was trying to write the review from a hospital bed while being diagnosed and then treated with pneumonia.<br />So, here goes my second attempt of Everyone Dies. The latest in the long running series written by<BR> Michael McGarrity and featuring main character Kevin Kerney. Everyone Dies takes place in and around Sante Fe and other scenic areas in New Mexico. Santa Fe Police Chief Kevin Kerney and his wife, Lt. Colonel Sara Brannon, are on leave and eagerly awaiting the birth of their son when a prominent gay attorney is gunned down outside his office by an unknown assailant. Called to the crime scene and faced with scanty evidence and no apparent motive, Kerney directs his chief of detectives to delve into the victim's personal and professional life, a decision which ultimately leads to a SWAT team screw-up and the death of two innocent people. But the killer has just begun. Kerney's horse, a mustang he'd gentled  trained, is viciously and senselessly destroyed, a dead rat is left on his doorstep, and a second victim with ties to the criminal justice system is found in bed with her throat cut along with a warning, EVERYONE DIES.<BR> I need to admit right now that I wasn't that impressed with EVERYONE DIES after reading it. I put that off to being ill and feeling like I \\"owed \\" the publisher something for sending me the book.<BR>I must say that I've read MOST of the other books in the series. After doing so, I've come to feel that the characters that Michael McGarrity writes about are members of my family. After rereading EVERYONE DIES, I still can't say this is the best Kevin Kerney book. But it does add more \\"character\\" to the already lifelikemanship (is THAT A WORD?) to Kerney, his fiance' Sara, and how the other characters react and \\"live\\" a certain situation. I strongly encourage readers of action-packed police stories to check all of the Kevin Kerney series out. There's alot going for the series. Number one for me: it doesn't take place in LA or NYC. The writer, Michael McGarrity does an excellent job of portraying the natural beauty of the American Southwest. (specifically New Mexico). McGarrity develops believable human relationships for his<BR>characters to engage his readers.<br />Again, I'd like to thank the publisher for sending me a copy of EVERYONE DIES. Not the best of the writer's work. But good enough to make me want to read more in this series. Another BTW - Many of his published editions have maps drawn by (I believe McGarity's son) placed somewhere close inside the inside cover. I noticed another reviewer who thought the books would be enhanced with a map. The maps are helpful. Just don't expect USGS hiker scale type maps, ok?<BR>BTW, This is a review of the UNABRIDGED RECORDED VERSION. I had a relative pick up a copy to listen to while recuperating in bed.<br />John Row	2003-08-28

Living in Colorado  I enjoy searching out and reading mysteries that either take place in Colorado or are written by Colorado authors. The author, Mark Cohen, lives in Nederland, Colorado.<br />In this award winning  mystery novel, &quot;Hard-Boiled&quot; Detective Pepper Keane is hired by a tall and attractive math professor (with whom he of course eventually starts a romantic relationship) who is concerned about the deaths of three of her colleagues. Three victims, three different states. Although the FBI concludes that the deaths are unrelated, she is convinced that these three mathematicians were murdered because of their knowledge of fractal geometry. <br />I give The Fractal Murders a very high rating as a mystery, a genre I almost read exclusively and may be a bit jaded about and very critical of, because it was clever enough to keep me from figuring out the solution too early even though all of the clues were there. The writing style, however, did not completely appeal to me. But this was more than made up for by a main character and plot that kept me interested. This is obviously a first novel. The development of characters is still in an early stage. But I look forward to more mysteries with Pepper Keane as the main character. <BR>The list of suspects grows and the plot becomes more interesting as you proceed. This is a &quot;Hardboiled&quot; P.I. / detective novel. So, at times the  book is pretty violent and at times very funny. The ending has you holding your breath until the last page. Unfortunately, there are a number of typos, which proved disconcerting to me, but they did not minimize my enjoyment of the book. I look forward to more of Pepper Keane.<BR>Before reading Fractal Murders, I knew nothing about fractal mathematics. After reading Fractal Murders, I still know very little about fractal mathematics. But that's okay. I don't think the point of the book was to teach Fractal Mathmatics, but was just part of  the plotting. Anyway, it all makes sense as the story unfolds. <BR>I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. You'll think you solved the crime early and often. But the ending will surprise you!<BR>John Row	2003-07-20

The Feds have taken over, thinking a terrorist group is involved. The murder victim is lost in  the federal zeal. Then  it seems the killer will be set free to aid the feds' misled terrorist hunt, Bosch quickly finds himself in conflict with both his old colleagues and the FBI. He cannot rest until he finds the killer-with or without a badge. This is one unsolved case that keeps Harry up at night.<BR>Lost Light comes as close to the books of  Michael Connelly's admired hard boiled detective author,Raymond Chandler.  Smart, action packed and gritty with a regular guy as the main character that you come to care about.<BR>Different, too, in this go around  Harry Bosch narrates the story. It isn't told to us in a 3rd person style.(even though Connelly did  that so well in previous books).  We know why Harry does what he does, thinks what he thinks and what his next step will be. Harry doesn't have his badge anymore. But he's armed with a Private Investigator's License, his wits and the street smarts of a successful ex murder detective.<br />I've enjoyed Michael Connelly's writing from his first book \\"The Black Echo\\" through the non Harry Bosch books. Connelly's characters, style and plotting are exciting yet plausable. Every word brings you closer to an ending that you know will both surprise and satisfy the most jaded mystery reader.<br />This was a good purchase and stands out as one of Connelly's best Harry Bosch books!  Even though Harry is retired now, I and his other thousands of readers can only shout \\"MORE, MORE\\". Michael Connelly has lived up to his hero, writer Raymond Chandler. Writing exciting, intelligent who dun its and creating a more than good enough hero for solving them.<br />I have always got my money's worth with Michael Connelly books. Whether the Harry Bosch series or either of his less known series of mysteries. This was another great read.<BR>John Row	2003-07-18

They do not hold near the information, clarity and in depth detail, thus VALUE, that Haynes Repair Manuals do. Having said that, I would like to address some complaints I've come across about both Haynes<BR>and Chilton's Manuals.<BR>1.) If your manual suggests at a point to seek professional input it is because MOST NON mechanics don't possess the skill or tools or shop equipment to perform a certain procedure (be it correctly or safely). The publishers' lawyer insisted on the \\"seek professional input\\" so as not to take on legal liability for an unqualified person attempting to perform a critical step in their car care. The reason is valid. You can injure yourself and damage your vehicle as well as render your<BR>vehicle unsafe to be on the road.<BR>2.) Prior to purchasing a repair manual, LOOK THROUGH IT. Almost every auto parts store in America sells Haynes and / or Chilton's. If the particular manual you need doesn't have the plastic removed, look for a manual that does and look through the sections. CAUTION most auto supply stores will get mad and make you buy anything you rip open. They're trying to sell information contained in the manual, not give it away. Some copies are USUALLY open and can be looked<BR> at. Does the manual seem logical, good pictures? Thorough? Then CHANCES ARE that brand will be a good choice for your repair. Also READ the cover front & back thoroughly. It will tell you if special vehicles aren't covered (AWD, Alternate Fuel Vehicles, etc) Know what vehicle you have so you get the RIGHT manual. The correct year, make, model, engine size.<BR>3.) If you do encounter a problem in the middle of a repair, it's possible that it is YOUR not doing something correctly. Not the tool, or the repair manual. Go away from the car, get lunch or a cold glass of lemonade, read through the manual. Even start again in the morning. <BR>4.) As automobiles become more sophisticated, there is truly less and less that a vehicle ownercan do him or herself. It is a fact, you will need to take your vehicle into a dealership or well equipped shop for more things. In addition, used oil and other fluids are difficult to dispose of. DO NOT THROW DOWN YOUR DRAIN OR BURY IN YOUR BACKYARD!!!. Tires, batteries all have special disposal needs.<BR>5.) There are some people WHO ARE NOT MECHANICAL. Buy them books, audio / video equipment, ties for Christmas. NOT A WRENCH SET!<BR>6.) Neither Haynes nor Chilton are Professional Shop Manuals (these are available for hundreds of dollars).<BR>As for the particular manual for the Haynes (ASIN: 1563923580) Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town & Country from years 1996 through 1999: This manual does NOT COVER All-Wheel Drive nor Alternative Fuel Models AND SAYS SO ON THE COVERS. Haynes breaks down into different sections each of the engine options (in this example: 4 cylinder,3.0 liter V6, 3.3 liter V6, and 3.8 V6) If you're say, changing an air filter, make sure you're looking at the right directions for the engine for the vehicle you have. The different engines have important items positioned in different locations and thus DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONS for each item on each engine. You can even utilize Amazon \\"take a look inside\\" feature to check out if this manual is for you or not. .I checked it's description for changing wiper blades, oil and oil filters, air filters and general repairs and found it both accurate and easy to understand. I've been happy with Haynes manuals over the years and recommend all vehicle owners purchase one even if you don't expect to do any repair or service yourself. It helps to know the information, to be aware of how your car works and to talk in a reasonably intelligent manner (on your part anyway) when you take your vehicle in for service.<br />I'm happy with this purchase. And have been with every Haynes manual I've bought and used in the last 20 years.<BR>John Row	2003-07-18

Jeffery Deaver is a master of misdirection. He presents some facts, you read them and you think you have the solution--- and you're always wrong. He plays fair. All the facts are presented and even given to you on the \\"clue board\\" that the Rhyme / Sachs team draw up every few chapters. In The Vanished Man,  Deaver's craftsmanship is first-rate as always and his research into the professional world of magic and illusion is not only informative but also compelling. He excels at both plotting and characterization.<br />It begins at a prestigious music school in New York City, with the death of a young music student who was cruelly tied up in a way that strangled her.. A killer flees the scene of a homicide and locks himself in a classroom. <BR>Within minutes, the police have him surrounded.  When a scream rings out, followed by a gunshot, they break down the door. The room is empty. And thus the reader is enmeshed in another great mystery.<BR>Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs are brought in to help with the high-profile investigation. For the ambitious Sachs, solving the case could earn her a promotion. For the quadriplegic Rhyme, it means a litlle time away from the tedium and boredom of being  a quadrapalegic and it means relying on his protégée again to ferret out a master illusionist they've dubbed \\"the conjurer\\" who baits them with gruesome murders that become more diabolical with each fresh crime. As the fatalities rise and the minutes tick down, Rhyme and Sachs must move beyond the smoke and mirrors to prevent a terrifying act of vengeance that could become the greatest vanishing act of all. <br />So how does The Vanishing Man stack up against previous Rhyme / Sachs mysteries by Deavers? One way to compare, is to look at the bad guys and compare them.<BR>In a recent interview, Deaver describes The Vanished Man: \\"The Vanished Man pits Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs against a psychotic illusionist (think David Copperfield meets Hannibal Lecter) who commits a series of brilliantly executed crimes in New York using magic, escapist and illusionist techniques. How can we resist?<BR>This is the fifth book in the Lincoln Rhyme/AmeliaSachs series. <BR>Deavers says as long as fans keep wanting to read about Rhyme and Sachs, he'll keep writing novels about them. GREAT <BR>NEWS FOR US FANS!!!<BR>The Vanished Man was a Literary Guild Main Selection.<br />I enjoyed The Vanishing Man because I've grown to know and care about the main characters Rhyme and Sachs through <BR>previous Jeffery Deaver novels. I always expect a top notch mystery from Deavers.  And get it.<BR>John Row	2003-07-12

Raichlen traveled the WORLD in search of BBQ recipes (over 500!) in The Barbecue Bible. I graduated from burgers, steaks and grilled chicken breasts to Tandoori Chicken, Thai,  and how to grill a whole fish ifrom the 556 pages!<BR>So, again, how do you top the definitive work on open fire cooking? BBQ USA! 774 PAGES of over 425 recipes from all over the US, INCLUDING THE comprehensive history of BBQ in the US thanks to KC Masterpiece originator, Dr. Rich Davis. There are pages and pages of biographical info on BBQ icons and institutions in the United States and even one recipe from Canada! And more pictures.<BR>I personally feel that even as a novice, you actually could pick up this huge volume and begin almost anywhere, any recipe and be successful. The book covers the basics in the beginning chapter. Choosing and using grills and accessories and even includes basic and more advanced techniques to grilling. You'll probably see someone disagree with that statement. I defy the naysayers to name a better bbq book WRITER. Raichlen may not be in front of PBS, or Food network cameras as much as Hirsch, Flay, et al. Steven Raichlen just writes the most comprehensive books on BBQ anywhere!<BR>I must also mention a trend I've noticed in some other cookbook writers (some very well known) that are releasing cookbooks that rearrange recipes from their previous books and call them new and sell them based on their well known names. I looked through the indexes of BBQ Bible and compared it to BBQ USA. There are no or none that I could find repeats that appear in both books.  <BR>One other thing we as Americans can be proud of is our BBQ!<BR>God Bless our Troops <BR>I enjoyed this book, not only for the great food recipes but the great stories and history presented. If I were stuck on a deserted island with just my Weber and Raichlen's books on BBQ, I wouldn't want to be rescued. <BR>John Row	2003-07-08

They do not hold near the information, clarity and in depth detail, thus VALUE, that Haynes Repair Manuals do. <BR>Having said that, I would like to address some complaints I've come across about both Haynes and Chilton's Manuals.<BR>1.) If your manual suggests at a point to seek professional input it is because MOST NON mechanics don't possess the skill or tools or shop equipment to perform a certain  procedure (be it correctly or safely). The publishers' lawyer insisted on the \\"seek  professional input\\" so as not to take on legal liability for an unqualified person attempting to perform a critical step in their car care. The reason is valid. You can injure yourself and damage your vehicle as well as render your vehicle unsafe to be on the road.<BR>2.) Prior to purchasing a repair manual, LOOK THROUGH IT. Almost every auto parts store in America sells Haynes and / or Chilton's. If the particular manual you need doesn't have the plastic removed, look for a manual that does and look through the sections. CAUTION most auto supply stores will get mad and make you buy anything you rip open. They're trying to sell information contained in the manual, not give it away. Some copies are USUALLY open and can be looked at. Does the manual seem logical, good pictures? Thorough? Then CHANCES ARE that brand will be a good choice for your repair. Also READ the cover front & back thoroughly. It will tell you if special vehicles aren't covered (AWD, Alternate Fuel Vehicles, etc) Know what vehicle you have so you get the RIGHT manual. The correct year, make, model, engine size.<BR>3.) If you do encounter a problem in the middle of a repair, it's possible that it is YOUR not doing something correctly. Not the tool, or the repair manual. Go away from the car, get lunch or a cold glass of lemonade, read through the manual. Even start again in the  morning. <BR>4.) As automobiles become more sophisticated, there is truly less and less that a vehicle owner cando him or herself. It is a fact, you will need to take your vehicle into a dealership or well equipped shop for more things. In addition, used oil and other fluids are difficult to dispose of. DO NOT THROW DOWN YOUR DRAIN OR BURY IN YOUR BACKYARD!!!. Tires, batteries all have special disposal needs.<BR> 5.) There are some people WHO ARE NOT MECHANICAL. Buy them books, audio / video equipment, ties for Christmas. NOT A WRENCH SET!<BR>6.) Neither Haynes nor Chilton are Professional Shop Manuals (these are available for hundreds of dollars).<br />As for the particular manual for the Haynes (ISBN: 1563921324 ) Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager<BR>and Chrysler Town & Country from years 1984 through 1995: This manual does NOT COVER All-Wheel Drive nor Alternative Fuel Models AND SAYS SO ON THE COVERS. You can even utilize Amazon \\"take a look inside\\" feature to check out if this manual is for you or not. .I checked it's description for changing wiper blades, oil and oil filters, air filters and general repairs and found it both accurate and easy to understand. I've been happy with Haynes manuals over the years and recommend all vehicle owners purchase one even if you don't expect to do any repair or service yourself. It<BR>helps to know the information, to be aware of how your car works and to talk in a reasonably intelligent manner (on your part anyway) when you take your vehicle in for service.<br />I'm happy with this purchase. And have been with every Haynes manual I've bought and used in the last 20 years.<BR>John Row	2003-07-08

I lived, but have suffered an atrophied muscles, osteoporosis ( I'm a 50 year old male) and neural damage and since the trauma, I have suffered tremendous pain throughout my body. So far, no doctor, no medical testing have been able to relieve the pain or even find a cause.<BR>I truly was contemplating suicide. My only alternative was to see if I could control the pain with my mind.<BR>On the advise of a counselor, I borrowed this eight tape set.  No matter what you have had happened to cause the trauma, I sincerely recommend this tape series! Peter Levine has a series of exercises and case studies that in some manner will be able to help victims of trauma to relieve the pain emotionally or physically.<BR>I can't promise you 100% relief. But the series helped me. <BR>The tape series describes some of Levine's cases, the trauma and the aftermath for each patient. What I found was (despite what the trauma was) that the patients thoughts and healing processes were appropriate to what I felt in my own situation.<BR>I wouldn't suggest that the tape series is the stand alone cure for the traumatic incidents in everyone's lives. But, would HIGHLY recommend it as a helpful tool in conjunction with other treatment, be it medical or mental health.<BR>I listen to these tapes when I need some extra emotional support to get through especially painful times.<BR>John Row	2003-07-02

And I would reckon at some point a teacher wrote \\"Needs to try harder and apply himself better\\" on Mr. Moore's report card. <BR>The Good: You want JC to exact his revenge. In other words, you want the PLOT to be developed in a logical way and to a logical ending.<BR>Here is a main character who is thrown into prison for ten years, when he and three friends since childhood commit a robbery and everyone EXCEPT the main character gets off TOTALLY free because the three friends ALL snitch out JC.<BR>Ain't how it works Bro. One snitch rolls on everyone else including his first grade teacher. That's how it works. <BR>So anyway, JC finally serves his 10 spot, gets out of prison, and goes about setting up his accomplices - RichKid, Zo and Lil G. Not to kill them, just wanting to take away everything they had gotten while in prison.<BR>A BIG job, but low and behold, the money he stashed from the heist has remained safe and to the tune of $750,000! That's 3/4 of 1 MILLION dollars! So instead of taking the money and being retired, JC uses the money to set up his REVENGE.<BR>Where's the reason for these actions? But, again, I WANT JC to kick some tail, so the reader can forgive a bit of unrealistic character motivation .<BR>Anyway, there are several other weak points where reason and motivation on the part of the book's characters don't come close to entering the characters thoughts.. There's alot of supposed street potty mouthin'. \\"MF this / MF that...\\" There's a lot of adolescent  graphic sex fantasy ( really beautiful but experienced ho doin the most nasty stuff with JC) stuff.<BR>I think there's alot of good writing we can expect from Mr Moore. Triple Take is just a so so first novel. Mr Moore is a Black writer who tried real hard to convey life on the streets - Dealing, Hookin, etc. And got caught up in using too many cliches to represent his characters. Good kid, bad friends, incarcerated unfairly, gets out, turns to drugs and violence to make his point. And though he never set out to be a big time dealer, living in a penthouse, driving a Jag-u-ar ain't so bad. <br />For some reason, my copy even has a \\"Reading Group Guide\\".

And those Americans who have even less idea what makes a TRULY GREAT AMERICAN President, READ THIS BOOK. <BR>Anyone can take the world to the edge of the End of humanity. It takes strong, intelligent leaders with their own peoples' best interests in mind, leaders who understand what an all out war means at this point in Humanities history,  to step back from the brink of all out war.<BR>This book explores the FIRST great Devil to American society - Communism and it's best known leader (at least in the U.S.). At that point Khruschev stood against Kennedy. He stood in front of NATO and the world pounding his shoe on the podium, saying \\"We will destroy you\\". This did not come to be. Because of hard nosed DIPLOMACY! Poker faced, all the stakes, bluff em, hold em DIPLOMACY.<BR>Khrushev played and won at Russian politics during the long reign of Stalin. If you fell from favor in the midst of this time it meant a bullet to the back of the head.

And wish that the expertise of leadership and diplomacy that got us through, could have been written and passed down to future generations of leaders.

There cannot have been a more tense situation leading to potential nuclear war than what transpired in the 1960's between the USA and USSR. Yet all out war was diverted. <BR>Bless Our Troops<br />John Row	2003-03-31

I felt the author didn't put the essence of that into this book.  One of the reviewers was quoted on the cover of my edition of this book - that Staten provided &quot;odd facts and interesting tales&quot; and there WERE some odd facts but the tales for the most part, left a lot to be desired.<BR>Everyone has a memory of the corner hardware store, all the assorted &quot;stuff&quot;, fasteners, paints, stains, ladders and knife display cases. The author grew up in hardware stores, his father owned hardware stores, yet there just wasn't any sense of enjoyment or adventure, nor a sense of excitement of this in the book. I know I would have been there everyday exploring and getting the scoop on everything.<br />I may have been expecting more out of this book than could be delivered. I recently read Tools of the Earth and Tools of the Trade, both by Jeff Taylor. I think I was looking for what Taylor was able to deliver in his books.

I've waited several weeks after reading this book to try and write a review.<BR>My expectations of The Lovely Bones was it was a mystery novel from a very unique viewpoint - namely from the victim's narrative from an afterlife. I'm enthralled with the process of crime scene investigation and quotes \\"that the victim herself would tell her story\\" that come from investigators and law enforcement. So, obviously, I got something more and different than I expected! <BR>After reading Lovely Bones, I can say that it is a book that hit me on many different levels. In a secondary way, Lovely Bones is a mystery. But it's more. In an odd way, because of the perspective of the narrator being in Heaven, it's a coming of age story. <br />Somewhere, in the critical reviews from 'PAID\\" reviewers, this book was compared to \\"To Kill a Mockinbird\\". And it ISin the same league, or very close. \\"To Kill a Mockinbird\\" showed Kit, the main character in TKAM, the adult's world of hatred, violence, bias.  And the ways different people both are affected and deal with hatred and violence.<br />The Lovely Bones shows us another child, Susie Salmon, and her family dealing with violence.  <BR>And seeing how  each member of Susie's family has to deal with her death, and how a whole town eventually comes to grips with the violence and loss. Each person healing from the grief and anger. <br />I enjoyed the perspective of \\"heaven\\" that Alice Sebold describes. I found it broke my lifelong concepts of heaven in a reassuring way. I guess what I'm attempting to say is \\"Yea! That's what heaven should be like!\\"  Susie was able to see how others (family, friends, even her killer) dealt with her death and overcame the tragedy. Thus, helping her to come to terms and to \\"move on\\" on her journey.<br />I must say that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is an all time favorite book AND movie of mine. I can honestly say I've read the book probably 50 times and viewed the movie almost the same amount. So, I had to wait a bit to review The Lovely Bones in comparison to the all time classic. <BR>There are a few uneven parts to Lovely Bones. It isn't perfect, but The Lovely Bones can be favorably compared to Mockinbird. And Bones could very well become a classic with time. <BR>I enjoyed it on many levels. I cared about the characters. The \\"plot\\" was unique and interesting. And I can say I'll pick my copy up many times in the future to read the story again. Lovely Bones has so much going for it, most readers will forgive it's shortcomings.<br />A Happy Reader<BR>John Row	2003-02-24

CJ Floyd is a Black bailbondsman in Denver, who ends up chasing down some of the most inventive bail jumpers and bad guys around. <BR>Limited Time was a bit of a let down after Greer's three previous CJ Floyd books because CJ seemed to be more of a drop in or continuity character than the strong main character of the previous books. <BR>The actual mystery aspect was still strong, but I've come to expect more in regards to CJ's &quot;everyday guy&quot; personna.

HST is bitingly funny in his recounting of episodes fighting against the System. In \\"The Witness\\" a has been well known porn star tries her damndest to set Hunter up for a BIG fall on drug charges and sexual assault. Thompson embarasses and shames the District Attorney and LEO's of Pitkin County (here in Colorado where he lives in Aspen).Thompson is, as always, his own person. Describing his days in SF working as Night Manager for the Mitchell Brothers  famous O'Farrell Theater - THE center of pornography in it's heyday. Long running legal battles with Diane Feinstein and the leading edge of Freedom of Expression involving Sex in America. Oh enough BS! Thompson loved hanging out with strippers and other free spirits!<br />This is Thompson's first book since the September 11 attacks. He (accurately, in my opinion) feels that life in America will never be the same. Our generation and todays children, will be in a state of war for our lifetimes. He speculates that, for the first time in recent American history, the next generation will be less well off than the current generation. And America will relearn the sacrifices of previous generations. Not necessarily a bad thing.<br />Kingdom of Fear is a series of funny, irreverent memoirs describing events in Hunter S Thompson's life. He admits that some embellishing took place. A bit of what he writes about takes place in Aspen with quite a bit of Colorado \\"references\\" and landmarks, and personalities. Which (as a long time resident) I found enjoyable. The Ducati blast through \\"ranch\\" traffic and close calls with the \\"sausage maker\\" are hilarious.<BR>The book has quite a few photographs including the back cover of Hunter buck naked except his famous hat firing a shotgun. <BR>To sum up: As HST's good friend Warren Zevon wrote:  \\"lawyers, guns and money\\"<br />A fun read from a guy who has led an interesting life!	2003-01-29

Be aware of every nuance of your surroundings, the people who can be potential attackers, what can be used as a weapon, the most advantageous place and angle for someone to attack you from, a motive - on the street, whether it be the Rolex on your wrist, your car, your woman or just looking like easy prey.  Arm yourself with this information, avoid or minimize the opportunity of an attack and you're more likely to avoid getting attacked. Be prepared to ESCAPE from danger.<br />The second \\"SECRET\\" is to be mentally prepared to do WHATEVER it takes to protect yourself or loved ones. Can you kill someone, can you gouge an eye, bite a face, grab and twist body parts? Stab another human being, shoot them? When attacked with a knife, some cutsie pie, two fingered spinning nose flick isn't going to save your [hide].<br />This book deals with being in a situation where you can't avoid attack.

I have one of the first editions of this book from 1986. The fast food industry had come under fire from numerous consumer groups and health organizations and was changing over to \\"healthier\\" alternatives in food choices as well as preparation. I remember McD's using animal fat to fry french fries. Death and heart disease never tasted so good.<br />This book is interesting because you can compare what the nutritional info for your favorite fast food is next to a heathier alternative. You should see the differences from 1986 industry wide! Overall, less fat, and calories, but still way more than needed in a healthy diet. It isn't written in a \\"holier - than - thou\\" tone. More of a matter of fact manner<br />This covers every major fast food chain, even some that are mostly regional.  <br />This book is both encouraging and depressing because of the rising incidence of morbid obesity (I'm in that category) in the U.S. and the dependence we have on fast food to feed our children. The food eaten sparingly, isn't going to kill anyone but a full time diet of it can! Encouraging because, believe it or not, fast food IS healthier than it was.<BR>This book originally came out around the time it became mandatory for restaurant chains and food processors to disclose nutritional information.

At this point NO ONE knows who Jack The Ripper was. Not Scotland Yard, not the many armchair detectives who peruse the volumes of writing on this gruesome killer. Certainly the case against Walter Sickert is no more or less full of holes than any other theory. Cornwell's Portrait is still a good read. She doesn't posture any more than any previous writer on the subject ( and a lot less in some cases, than her critics reviews) for her conclusions.<BR>I learned a lot on Sickert and see this more along the lines of an \\"Unauthorized Biography\\" of the man. Maybe this is a conspiracy between the Royal Family and Cornwell to distract attention from the REAL killer... hmmm<BR>I, too, am still PO'd at Cornwell for wasting my money on \\"Isle of Dogs\\", but not enough to forget the entertainment from the Scarpetta books before it. <BR>I too am a Ripperologist.

Michael writes reviews for new knife models in several knife magazines on the newstands including &quot;Tactical Knives&quot; magazine. Mr Janich's book, Street Steel: Choosing And Carrying Self-Defense Knives, includes good insight into exactly what is necessary in a carry knife. You probably don't need a sword, by the way.  As mentioned, he has designed several respected models of knives for different manufacturers including MOD and Spyderco. <br />I was lucky enough to take a Beginner's course in Martial Bladecraft with Michael. During the break in his course, he brought out 30 to 40 of the recent popular models of folding knives that are on the market. We got to handle the knives and get Mr Janich's thoughts on the pluses and minuses of each model. That information is the basis of this book.

Use this book along with careful planning, to know what questions to ask either a sprinkler supply distributor or to hire an irrigation contractor.	2002-11-23

I was disappointed as I mentioned in my first review of this book, because almost it's entire content including most of the recipes were previously included in his past cook books. The recipes are delicious. Granted.<br />The other problem is the poor binding of this edition. The pages are falling out.<br />If you own Mr Bayless' previous books, you have the contents of this book. I am a fan of Mr Bayless, but I have been disappointed in this endeavor. I used to purchase any item with his byline sight unseen. I will at least thumb through any future cookbooks before future purchase.	2002-11-19

Both the content and the actual book have stood up to many years of use. My young son enjoys participating in meal selection and preparation. Now if I could convince his mom he's ready to grill outside! The recipes are fun and delicious. This cookbook gives a child fundamentals in measuring and the basic \\"science\\" of cooking.  Nice durable ring bound book with good illustrations.	2002-11-18

Instead, let's talk about the book! Beautiful printing on quality paper. The included commentary and history put a perspective to each piece of art that most readers wouldn't have otherwise. Peter Max inspired my wife to become an artist. She'll cherish this book for years to come. If you are a Max fan, so will you. As all coffee table books are, a bit pricey but an excellent work to enjoy again and again!	2002-11-12

A down to earth man and great wit. Fowler is very much admired by knife users and makers alike. This IS a very entertaining book. Just be aware that knifemaking demands a lot of time, often alot of equipment, and inate skill on the maker's part. This book won't make you a knifemaker. It may inspire you to want to be one though. Compared to the other books in this price range and size, it has alot of information and fairly good illustrations. It does show you that a man's personality is very important to the quality of his craft.	2002-10-17

Unfortunately becoming quickly outdated	This book is full of information for those interested in spying, PI'ing and privacy issue buffs. Unfortunately, some if not most, of it's information is over eight years old and in dire need of an update.<BR>The public information gathering section still has relevence. And it is written in a tongue in cheek manner which I enjoyed. There are also quite a few typographical errors in this edition which lend a bit of humor themselves.	2002-10-17

The book includes beautiful color photographs of the most commonly seen bats in America. One of the most appreciated sections is the &quot;Beginners' Key To American Bats&quot;, a well written, easy to comprehend section on identifying common bats of the region and placing them in their proper groups. Very important if you intend to build bat houses and hope to attract occupants and just general knowledge.<BR>The book includes several other interesting chapters besides identification. It shows how bats navigate with radar. It addresses the many negative myths of bats,  it explains how beneficial bats are in nature.  If you want or need to know anything at all about these interesting creatures, THIS is the book and Merlin Tuttle is the expert to seek out. And even if you only need to know enough about bats to humanely evict them from your belfry, this book comes with even that information! <BR>The author has dedicated his life to these interesting mammals. Even without knowing that fact, you can see from the entertaining way Mr Tuttle writes, how much he cares.  All of his books are excellent. Check them all out!	2002-10-04

I've been inspired by Rick Bayless's teaching, both from his PBS series' and his cookbooks. I also own his previous books -  this is pretty much a rehash of recipes for salsas and dishes from the hardbound books. He even includes his &quot;Onions and garlic are the fabric that runs through Mexican cooking...&quot; quote from his previous books. <BR>If you own his other books or you watch his PBS cooking shows, there's nothing new to learn in this book. Other than having recipes written down in it. <BR>Again, I enjoy Mexican food and Rick Bayless, but I was disappointed.	2002-06-12
