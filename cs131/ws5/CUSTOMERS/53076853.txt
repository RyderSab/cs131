Along with that, came a couple of biographies, one by Hobson and one by Teachout. <br /> <br />I've read both biographies and made my way through about half of this self-collected work.  It boggles the mind that Mencken had (or had he?) the impact that he was supposed to have had during the 1910s through 1930s.   <br /> <br />He was wa racist and a bigot.  Many of the pieces in Chrestomathy are culled from his \\"Prejudices\\" series.  Prejudice implies having some experience to base an opinion on.  Here is a man who rarely set foot outside of Baltimore, except for regular trips to NYC to meet with his publisher.  He said pretty nasty things about Jews (despite Knopf, his publisher and alleged friend, being one), and blacks (at one point claiming that the only intelligent blacks were those who had some white blood introduced by the massa during the good old days of slavery).  He lived at home with mom and his siblings until she died, and lived in the same house except for a five year period when he was married (in his 50s).  Oh, he did visit Germany a few times -- his family was of German origin and Mencken seemed to have the idea that the master race was reflected in himself - this boozy, narrow-minded fireplug of a man. <br /> <br />Not having a basis in fact for many of his prejudices, that leaves him a bigot.  He was ignorant.  He was smarmy and thought himself (and those like him) better than just about everybody.  He wrote nasty things about his \\"friends.\\"   <br /> <br />So, why is everybody interested in what he has to say?  He was considered an iconoclast because he wrote what he thought.  But once the shock value is gone, all that is left is some great writing (vocabulary, grammar, style) with some crappy content.  What he thought might have reflected his times, but my sense is that his times were really the last 1900s, not even the times when he wrote.	2005-08-13

It includes military, cyborgs, drugs, nanites, alien technology, global warming, cyberspace, love, hate, assassins, body-alteration, the end of civilization as we know it.  Whew. <br /> <br />But it is a real pain in the ass to get to the end of the book, find that NOTHING is resolved, and the \\"sequel\\" will be out in six months for another $7.  This is a bad trend in publishing -- split a \\"longish\\" book into two pieces and make twice the money.  In this case, however, the first half wasn't really too long and it could and should have been marketed as a single published work. <br /> <br />So, the real rating is 4 stars for the book, and minus 2 stars for the publisher. <br /> <br />If it looks like the publisher is going to stretch this out to 3 volumes, I won't bother with the second.	2005-02-06

As a 9 year old comic fanatic, I immediately latched on to the Fantastic Four and the progression of other Marvel heroes as they were invented -- and maintained my interest for several decades after.  I still occasionally pick up a comic. <br /> <br />I found Ro's book to be pretty poorly written and edited, and I think there are many errors in it.  For one thing, it is impossible to keep the chronology straight.  Dozens of pages go by without mention of the year.  There are flashbacks, but it is not clear when they end.  Dozens of repetitions of the same phrases, and people who appear out of nowhere, indicate minimal editing. <br /> <br />Despite the fact that Kirby was King, Ro seems to spend most of the center of the book talking about how Kirby's work was criticized and rejected, how Kirby couldn't write, and when he did, it was unreadable.   <br /> <br />How strange is it, though, that a book about the comics industry as it centered around Jack Kirby doesn't as much as have a single photo of the guy, or any examples of his work aside from the dust cover art? <br /> <br />Save your money and give this one a pass.	2005-02-06

As Solnit points out, his groundbreaking work was really the basis for motion pictures and much of other technology we take for granted today.<br />I took this book with me on an overnight flight to Brazil and compulsively read it cover to cover while I should have been sleeping.	2004-05-10

Set an indeterminate number of millenia before the &quot;real&quot; Dune books, it expands on the backstory alluded to therein.<br />But there's too much synchronicity -- too much happens or is invented at the same time during this first of three new novels.

A particularly disturbing touch is a robot who seems to be emulating the medical researches of Josef Mengele.<br />For all it's length, it is a fast read.  It would be a faster read if the authors hadn't assumed that the reader would forget what happened less than 50 pages ago -- resorting instead to padding the text with constant reminders and flashbacks.<br />I read it.  I will read the next two.  But the reading will most likely be as mechanical as the writing turns out to have been.	2002-12-30

Every page I looked at had something of interest.  <br />Broken into about 70 sections, the book covers a myriad of topics, some related to graphics, some to art, some to life, some to other things.  This book is impossible to classify, except to say that there's something engaging on every page and each page leaves you with a slightly different outlook.  This can be a great tool to jumpstart creativity, change perspective, alter rigid in-the-box thinking.<br />I'm not an artist or graphic designer, and don't know who Fletcher is (aside from the information in the book).

I spent about an hour a night with this book, worked through all the questions and answers.  In conjunction with web-based practice tests ([...] [...] or other locations -- these are free and invaluable for practice) after 2 painless weeks I found a local VEC site and took the test last Sunday.  Passed with a 100% score!<br />I felt so confident, that I decided to try the General exam (Element 3) the same morning and passed that one too (although not with such a stellar result).  I don't have to take the tech course now, and credited the fee toward club membership.<br />Bottom line -- ARRL knows the tests inside and out.  They've been publishing license guides for years, they administer the tests, and they write the manuals so that they can be easily understood -- they don't introduce jargon or advanced concepts/information until the basics have been presented.<br />Although I already passed the General theory test, I am working my way through ARRL's General license guide -- to make sure I know what I'm supposed to.  And studying Morse for Element 1 so I can get my General license.  I've already picked up the ARRL licensing guide for Amateur Extra (Element 4) and hope to get there by the summer.	2002-02-07

He ranges from how to photograph, to technical issues and equipment, to environmental issues, to seeing and creating.<br />I don't want to be Galen Rowell.

It is both more and less than that.  McPherson has covered the years leading up to the war, more a political and social history, which takes up a significant portion of the book.  The political and social aspects of the 1861-1865 period is covered in more detail than the military progress of the war.  This gives a well-rounded approach to the subject.<br />This is not a military history.  It is a full account of an era in American history.  It is well-written, well-documented, and an engaging work.  It is a terrific complement to Shelby Foote's three-volume narrative history and to the more recent single-volume military history of the war (The Longest Night by David Eicher -- itself said to be written as a complement to McPherson's book).	2002-01-17

It explains why and how we see what we see.  More, it provides the basis for the visual artist to take advantage and use that knowledge to make better images.<br />The printing is much better than the previous edition (thankfully) and the higher quality paper does away with the separate illustration section  that the first edition required.  The quotes from imagemakers in the margins (taken from two out of print Zakia works that should be back in print) are a valuable addition to the main text that helps provide a context for the material.<br />If you want to understand the psychology of visual images and visual messages, this is a unique book.	2002-01-17

His Festina Ramos books combine space opera with a screwball perspective on the universe.  Gardner's style is fast and breezy, a bit scatalogical.  Sort of like the 1930's comedies before the Hays Office started censoring them.<br />[Ascending] is a good story, action driven as always, and highly recommended.  I did have a few reservations about his choice of Oar, a character from a previous Ramos story, as narrator.  Oar comes across as an amalgam of Candide and Commander Data, and the first person narrative occasionally does become wordy and tedious.<br />This minor quibble aside, Ascending is a worthy addition to the League of Peoples series.

Skipping over the most basic elements of photography, he provides practical advice on technique and creative vision.  He isn't shy about using digital processes to enhance images -- not adding or subtracting visual elements, but manipulating the image so that it represents what the photographer saw, overcoming the limitations of film and photo paper.<br />Highly recommended.

Here is a completely compelling story of a campaign that was a defining moment of the war.

The players were England and Russia and the playing field was all of Central Asia.    The objectives were to maintain and expand each country's sphere of influence, while blocking the expansion of the others.  This was a negative sum game.<br />This fascinating book describes the how the game was played out through the 1800s and 1900s.  Taking an unusual approach, each of the book's chapters focuses on one or two key people, and profiles them and their activities amid the greater game.  Many of the people profiled were extremely well known in their time, but have since sunk into obscurity.  <br />Not all the focus is on the military, although the Afghan Campaigns, the Indian Mutiny, and other martial activities are covered.  A key target of both the British and Russians was Tibet, and the many attempts to reach Lhasa are covered here.  Also noted are &quot;explorers&quot;, archaeologists, and pundits (who helped fill in the white space on maps disguised as monks, counting distances in footsteps, keeping track of them with prayer beads, and noting direction with magnetic compasses hidden in prayer wheels).<br />Why only four stars?

Unlike many of Murakami's other novels, this one has few or none of the fantastic elements we've come to expect from him.  Rather, this is a coming of age story set in Japan in the late 1960s.  Toru (there's that name again) Watanabe is a not-too-engaged drama student living his own personal drama in a world that seems to be perpetually on quaaludes.<br />I don't want to give the plot away, but in its simplest terms, the story is one of a romantic triangle (quadrangle at times), where two of the sides are totally unconnected.  It's a story of impossible promises..  In the end, it is a sweet tale of love, commitment, and growing up.<br />This book was originally published in English in Japan (translated by Birnbaum, not Rubin), and has been long sought after here in the US.

Since then I've re-read it three or four times over the years.  It is a true monument to Caro that this book has remained in print in both hc and  pb over these years.  <br />This massive work is at the same time a biography  of Robert Moses and the metropolitan New York City area.  Moses, originally  a reformer and a true public servant, somehow became tainted by the power  entrusted to him.  It was his way or no way -- and once he became firmly  entrenched there was no &quot;no way.&quot;  A typical Moses tactic:   design a great public work (bridge, for example) and underestimate the  budget.  A bargain sure to be approved and funded by the politicians!  Then  run out of money halfway through construction.  The rest of the money will  surely be forthcoming because no politician wants to be associated with a  half-finished and very visibile &quot;failure&quot; -- it's much better to  take credit for an &quot;against the odds&quot; success.  <br />I grew up in  NYC at the tail end of Moses' influence and I remember the 1964 Worlds Fair  in NYC vividly, especially a &quot;guidebook&quot; that lionized Moses'  construction prowess.  In school, Moses' contribution was also taught  (always positively) when we had units covering NYC history.  If nothing  else, Moses understood the power of good publicity, and used tactics later  adopted by the current mayor (King Rudy) to control the press and public  opinion.  This book brings Moses back to human scale and deconstructs (no  pun intended) his impact on the city.<br />The book is long, detailed, and  compelling.  Great beach reading -- especially at Jones Beach!  Now that it  is celebrating its 25th anniversary, a new retrospective afterword from the  author would be appreciated (perhaps a reprint of the article he wrote for  the New Yorker a few years ago on how he wrote the book).<br />An interesting  counterpoint to this biography of Moses is TheGreat Bridge by David  McCollough.  This story of a great public works project is also a biography  of the Roeblings, the family of engineers who designed and built it.  They  shared Moses' singlemindedness, but the methods and results had far less  negative results.	2000-04-04

I haven't been disappointed and I'm very pleasantly pleased.  <br />The book is generally well written (obviously by an Englishman, not that there's  anything wrong with that, ahem), is well-organized, and has a minimum of  typos and errors (nobody's perfect, but this is closer than a lot of  others).  <br />The examples are well-chosen, and the exercises at the end of  each chapter do help stretch the old brain-wrinkles.<br />Highly recommended  if you want a quick start with VB6.	2000-01-26

Based on previous experience with Sams 21 Day books, I thought this package was a bargain.<br />I've made it through the first 7 of 21 days.  What a piece of excrement this book is!   It is riddled with typos and other errors.  Unclear and obtuse writing.  No  examples when introducing critical new concepts (example -- lesson 7 on  advanced keyboard and screen support provides few examples and none at all  on some of the functions).  I'm going to look for a better introductory  text.  And will not be going on to waste my time with the &quot;More&quot;  volume!<br />To keep this in context, note that I'm not a novice -- I've been  a FORTRAN and BASIC programmer for nearly 30 years.  I generally don't  bother to post unfavorable reviews here, but be warned!<br />By the way, the  working edition of VB (which doesn't compile or come with any of the MSDN  documentation) can be had for the price of shipping from Microsoft.   Save your bucks for the VB Learning Edition (which has MSDN) or the  Professional edition (which does lots more).	2000-01-16

It's the story of two guys and would make a great buddy film.  Of course, there's plenty of  carrying on and cameo appearances (Geo Washington on hemp brownies, Ben  Franklin having had a bit too much electroshock therapy, various Brits, and  the duck and talking dog).  A revisionist version of pre-Revolutionary War  history.  All narrated by one Wickes Cherrycoke, the presumed ancestor of  one of Pynchon's minor (almost non-existant) characters from Gravity's  Rainbow<br />If you haven't read Pynchon before, this is a good starting  point.  Once you get the rhythm of it, you can plunge into Gravity's  Rainbow.<br />P.S. Mason and Dixon were the surveyors behind the eponymous  geographic line separating southern Pennsylvania from the rest of the  world.	1999-12-13

A new approach to the medical SF genre (cf James White's Sector General series).  Here we have a new approach to healing and justice -- the medical inquisitor.  An interesting story and good setup to the next  in the series (there are three so far).  Matthews is a very good writer,  especially in these uncharted thematic territories.	1999-12-13
US	53076853	RHVN8ZHO85J4N	0380803143	946973644	Hour of Judgment	Books	2	2	5	N	N	Time to move on	This is the third in a series featuring the same universe and main character.  What started as a rather novel premise, the inquisitor medical officer using physical and chemical means of torture in the name of  &quot;justice&quot; has just about petered out.  <br />Matthews is a wonderful  writer, but I think she's run out of steam on this line.  The writing is  there, but the plot just doesn't have that Andrej zing.<br />I hope that her  newest (Avalanche Soldier) starts fresh anew.	1999-12-13
US	53076853	R2WAEGP6HIH9VY	0684846179	306559860	Big Trouble: A Murder in a Small Western Town Sets Off a Struggle for the Soul of America	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Hypertext on the printed page	Lukas's Big Trouble is about the assassination of a former Idaho governor at his home, just after the turn of the last century.  Lukas's Big Trouble is about just about everything that happened in the U.S. in the 50 years  before the &quot;main event.&quot;<br />You can read this book on two levels:  (1) follow the straight narrative of the murder and the subsequent trial or  (2) follow the book from beginning to end as it diverts and digresses  filling in an entire back story to the murder.  <br />Ranging from a history  of the Pinkerton detective agency (and its involvement in the Pennsylvania  coal fields in the 19th century), to the Buffalo soldiers, to the Civil War  and the Spanish American War, and the history of Colorado mining and labor  relations, this is an incredibly detailed and comprehensive work.  <br />It  bogs down a bit in some places, but it contains a generally lively  narrative, and is an engaging read.  If somebody would undertake it, this  could be converted to a great hypertext work (just click on the reference  in the main text and read all about the detail).	1999-12-13

It has been updated, with new and better photos.  A little more pricey than the previous edition, but the  added and enhanced content makes it a tremendous value.<br />A terrific  introduction to astronomy that deserves a place in every star-gazer's  library.	1999-11-25

After all the hoopla, the &quot;prequel&quot; to the Dune series finally arrives.  Lots of familiar characters, but +/- 30 years younger.<br />As the original Dune series grew, it grew tired.  With this addition, it is  disappointing to report that none of the vigor of the first novel is  restored.  Reading this was like reading a film novelization.  Scenes are  carefully laid out in cinematic terms, but there's little spark.  Wheels  within wheels, as the original Dune said, but a couple of the tires are a  bit soft.<br />There was a certain crispness in Dune that's lacking here.  Too  much recapping of what happened only a few pages before.  Short attention  span SF?  Maybe another edit would have helped keep the tension up.  Of  course this will be the first of a new series.  It is inevitable that the  purpose of the initial offering will be to set the stage, put the players  in action, but resolve some but not all of the conflicts.  Hopefully some  of the deficiencies noted here will be corrected.<br />I'll read the next one  and the next one after that.  But I probably will be short on praise for  those as well.	1999-11-10

Series)	Books	5	18	18	N	Y	Sorely needed and should be a big help	35mm photographic technology has reached a pinnacle, with electronically controlled cameras that perform autofocussing and autoexposure magic.  But many amateur photographers are still unhappy with their results, especially  in exposure.  Why?  As Farzad points out, despite the technical advances  exposure systems (auto and manual) still cannot tell the difference between  black and white, rendering any scene or subject into a middle  gray.<br />Farzad's book a provides a practical and simplified application of  the zone system, a topic that sends most tyro photographers running.  So  Farzad never mentions the &quot;z&quot; word.  Instead, he provides a  simple explanation of how photographic exposure systems work (regardless of  camera type).  He follows this with a simplified methodology to employ with  an on-camera spotmeter (found on many popular cameras today) to ensure  proper exposure.  The system is based on science but with use becomes  intuitive.  &quot;Cheat sheets&quot; for popular cameras incorporating  spotmeters are included to facilitate application of the principles  applied.<br />This is a well-produced self-published book, wiht lots of simple  graphics to illustrate the concepts conveyed.  Farzad himslef is an  accomplished amateur photographer and photographic instructor; examples of  his work can be found on his website.  If you are  Ansel Adams, this book is not for you.  If you want to begin to approach  Adams' technical style, start here.	1998-12-06

Rockefeller had always been one of my alltime favorite villains.  Living here in Westchester County, and working about a mile from Pocantico, the Rockefellers loom large.  Chernow's book provides a completely new  perpective on John D, his life, his times, and his work.  And particularly  on his philanthropy.  He might have achieved his fortune by not playing by  the book, but back then there wasn't a book to play by.  And more than  likely, if there hadn't been a John D. there would certainly have been  somebody else, perhaps worse.<br />Chernow is a masterful biographer.  And  here he is at his masterful best.	1998-11-23
