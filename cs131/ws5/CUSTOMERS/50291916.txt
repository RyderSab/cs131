Each character is uprooted from the familiar and must find a place that 'fits' in a new and strange landscape in which they are in many ways an outsider.  And as they find a place in which they 'fit', they find that each choice closes off channels of possibility, of adventure, and that in settling into their place, they must face up to the joy and pain of real (though sometimes mundane) life.  These common threads of exploration, adaptation, choice, these tie four very different generations together.  Margaret and Davis find on their wedding night that they really do fit.  Hilda finds Armand, then devotes herself to her daughter.  Danielle is both the light and the anchor for Osman's roving soul.  And Death is, inevitably, part of life.  In this story the separation of children from their parents severs them from familiar modes of understanding, from their history, and this forces them, with varying degrees of success, to forge new ways of understanding their place in the world.<br />I found the last scene quite moving.  Osman's carpets, thick with dust from their previous owners, are a piece of history that he cannot let go of, just as he cannot let go of his memories of Danielle.  Lost Geography is an easy read, but I believe the 'morals' may be deeper than it seems at first glance.  Osman's story as he tells it to his children during Danielle's illness may be much like Bacon's intention for her novel.  Sasha and Sophie are disappointed with the story because they did not expect such an abrupt ending.  \\"What's the moral?\\" they ask.  And avoiding cliche, Bacon also seems to answer casually, \\"I don't know,\\" leaving the pondering to the reader.<br />Bacon has a talent for carving out unique characters in simple, spare terms.  With love stories that resonate with deep romance, subtle shades of understanding, sharp observations about people's intentions, Lost Geography is a very movingaccount of four generations of 'migrants', in the literal and metaphorical sense of the word.	2003-04-15

Vivien - the realist with a razor-sharp intelligence, Wren - Vivien's cousin who was born with webbed hands and the natural sensibility of a dryad, and Hannah - Vivien's sister, a child who lives in a world of her own, who sees the days of the week in different colours, and for whom memory is a fluid, ephemeral thing.  Through these three Water Wings explores the relationship of Vivien and Hannah's beautiful mother Darlene and their father Mick.<BR>Den Hartog conjures up the beauty of the wild Ontario landscape in vivid colour and captures the fragility and poignancy of childhood innocence.	2003-04-04

The Cure for Death by Lightning layers folklore and mythology and the simple pleasures of baking with the gritty realities of family tragedy - of incest, violence, blindness and mental illness- all the while illuminating the strength and inner beauty of Beth Weeks and her growth into a woman.<br />I read an essay about Jane Austen once that discussed how tragedy, real tragedy, occurs in the setting of the household. It is because they are so close to us and so beloved that our family can be the cause of the greatest hurt. Brother pitted against brother, incest, domestic violence...the household is the centerpiece of tragedy. And if this is so, then Beth Weeks has known more than her fair share of tragedy. And yet, the novel manages to be hopeful without being sentimental, realistic without forgoing beauty.<br />Reading this book may disturb you, but will leave you with an indelible impression of blue forget-me-nots, the sooty marks of a hand on another, the imagined scent of violets, and the fragrance of fresh-baked pound cake.	2003-02-23

That his short life was cut off at such a young age was a tragedy in the sense of all the unwritten works that could have flowed from his pen, but even so, he achieved his life ambition of being \\"one of the English poets\\".<BR>Darkling I Listen is an incredibly moving account of the last days of this most tragic (and most romantic) of poets.  From his passionate letters to Fanny Brawne to his last moments under the care of his truest friend Joseph Severn, this story will wring your heart.	2003-02-13

Weaving together Arthurian legend, the classic battle between light and dark, and the lives of several innocent children thrown into the fray, Cooper's universe is one of charm, adventure, and danger.<BR>One of those excellent writers whose language practically melts away, leaving the reader vividly involved in the action, Cooper's battle between the forces of good and evil hurtles forward to the point of crisis, where the actions of the most uncertain characters can tip the balance.<BR>If you enjoyed The Chronicles of Narnia and other quality fantasy fiction steeped in myth and legend, read this series.  The Dark is Rising Sequence has become another standard in the world of young-adult fantasy.	2003-02-03

Kay and Aherne are appealing and strong female characters and their bond forms the center of the novel.  The action is fast-paced and the main characters suitably heroic.<BR>I found, however, that the Celtic world was VERY romanticized, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but the preponderance of &quot;ivory and diamond&quot; and the impossibly attractive main characters were a little too much for my taste.  Also, Melling appropriates Celtic history/myth and twists it into her own invention (saying that &quot;this is the way the story SHOULD have been&quot;).  Nevertheless, this is an imaginative story and quality fiction for younger readers.<BR>If you enjoy this, I recommend &quot;The Hunter's Moon&quot;, which I prefer to &quot;The Singing Stone&quot; and which gives the reader a keen longing to see Ireland.	2003-02-02

Structured loosely like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, &quot;Hyperion&quot; is the account of seven pilgrims journeying to seek answers at the Shrine of the Shrike, the mysterious and cultic killing machine that is somehow inextricably tied with each of the pilgrims' secrets.  As they journey to the Shrine, they share their stories.<BR>Simmons' fascination with the poet John Keats and the almost tangible presence of his poetry throughout the story only adds to the strangeness of his tale.<BR>I highly recommend this book to those interested in imaginative and intelligent science fiction, or lovers of Keats (hee hee).	2003-01-27

Byatt has created not only an engrossing novel, but an insightful commentary on literary critique.  Possession is a book of exceptional quality and depth - small wonder it won the Booker prize!  I wondered why I'd never heard of Randolph Henry Ash or Christobel LaMotte before and thought there had been some serious deficiencies in my education until I realized that the two poets were fictional.  The poetry is so well-realized that I would argue that Byatt herself is &quot;the Great Ventriloquist&quot;.  Any student of literature should read this book.  Although it is dense and sometimes difficult, the effort put into reading it will prove worthwhile!	2003-01-26

This is a story about grief, maturity, decisions, but most of all about the joy of life. Vicky Austin is just a girl - albeit a mature one with a real depth of soul - who as she matures into a young woman must start making some real decisions and learning some real lessons. Like most of Madeleine l'Engle's books the story occurs in a glorious natural setting.<br />As a teenager I wanted with all my heart to be like Vicky and to meet someone like Adam. And what girl wouldn't want to swim with the dolphins?<br />A splendid affirmation of life and love, this book is timeless.	2002-08-27

Set against a backdrop of a boys' prep school with WW2 unfolding far away, the war and its repercussions on the boys echo the struggle within Gene.  Torn with guilt at having caused Finny's injury, Gene at times tries to rationalize the accident, tries to absolve himself, but at last cannot deny the existence of the darker side of his own character.<br />Above all, A Separate Peace is about that something blind, something crazy that is present in each of us, no matter how hard we try to believe that we are good people.  We can blame Gene for Finny's accident and ultimately, his death, but we must also admit that Gene is a person like everyone else, and that in us also, we have something that we want to hide.<br />Finny, however, seems like the perfect person: a Christ figure, if you like (Though we could wonder just how selfless he is.  All those times when he proved himself better at something than the other boys, did he not feel self-gratification?  Did he ever feel superior?  Finny's struggle is something we will never know.).  In the end his forgiveness of Gene even before Gene can forgive himself paves the way for the peace that will follow - the peace when the war ends, and the peace that Gene finds when he comes to accept who he is.<br />John Knowles language is simple and touching, with descriptions that avoid being ornate or fanciful.	2002-07-25

Ingleside; Rainbow Valley; Rilla of Ingleside	Books	5	1	1	N	N	one of my favorites	A perennial favorite, Anne of Green Gables takes us to an intimate setting of a small Prince Edward Island community.  With the freshness of first-hand knowledge, Montgomery writes about daily life in Avonlea and the imaginative, vivid and hopelessly romantic young orphan, Anne-with-an-E.<br />With her impulsive affection and tendency to be accident-prone, Anne is one of the most endearing heroines to ever grace the pages of literature.  Her struggle to fit in and to be loved are heart-warming, as is the way her mind makes every small problem into a life-altering ordeal (the incident with the \\"puffed sleeves\\" springs to mind).<br />Meanwhile, the disapproving Marilla Cuthbert, the woman who takes Anne in, eventually learns to love the vivacious orphan - who is growing into a graceful young woman - and show affection of her own.<br />This book makes us all want to see the world through Anne's sparkling eyes and to live life as passionately.	2002-07-25

I've never gotten tired to reading and rereading it.  Beauty is a refreshing heroine with intellectual gifts rather than good looks, and her relationship with the Beast and his castle makes us understand her character a lot more than with other similar fairy stories.  Beauty is a person all young women could aspire to imitate.  The author is also excellent at describing the strange wonders of the castle, something I believe we have always wanted to see, but other stories have described unsatisfactorily.	2002-06-05

Lewis through the Chronicles of Narnia, which my mother gave to me when I was eight. I devoured them within a couple of weeks. Since then, my old set has become so dog-eared and worn out that I'm considering buying a new one.<br />C.S. Lewis blows me away with the depth of his insight into human character and relationship with God. The Chronicles are beautiful fairy tales, but all set within the context of a God-created world where Aslan reigns as a loving, self-sacrificing, and terrible savior. The characters are flawed, but extremely lovable. The richness of description of the world of Narnia make you feel that you know the place personally and that it is real. With action and adventure in each book, every one of them has something to say.<br />Lewis writes in a gentle, sensible voice, and avoids moralizing or preaching.  The \\"allegorical\\" elements of the books never overshadow the story and adventure and the lovable characters.<br /><br />There's not much more that I can say except to recommend these books highly. Read them! Read them now!	2002-06-05

It's the classic child fantasy: to do magic, surrounded by wonderful and benevolent creatures who understand human thought.  But The Forgotten Beasts of Eld departs from a children's story in that it is an experience in human emotion, set in this fantastic world of wizards and enchantresses.  For Sybel, for all her dispassionate coldness and power, is still human, and it is the discovery of her emotions and vulnerability that captures your heart.  McKillop deals with the incomprehensible, with the intangible.  Her prose invokes human experience without over-description.<br />This is a beautifully crafted jewel of a book.  For adults tired of the monolithic fluff of most fantasy stories today, this book is wonderfully refreshing.	2002-05-28

This book explores the darker side of human nature, the side behind easy domestic life, beyond common decency, beneath worldly success.  It may not be a pleasant book to read, as it doesn't gloss over the capacity for evil in a human being, but it is a book that will leave you thinking about just how authentic you are.  If you're not ready to face brutal honesty, don't read this book.  But if you're prepared for some deep insights into the nature of man, you shouldn't let this one pass you by.	2002-03-08

It's an absolutely lovable, romantic book with a happy ending, and hey, we all need books like that once in a while.<br />There's no doubt that \\"Daughter\\" is a largely character-driven book.  The two main characters are far ahead of their time and McGraw has the talent for bringing them vividly to life.  Some of the descriptive passages are so vivid you almost feel as it it's you sitting there (ie. \\"the sun-flecks dancing crazily over his face...\\").  The romance is restrained, but full of tension.<br />While some aspects of the novel seem far-fetched, McGraw seems to have sacrificed historical accuracy (and indeed, sometimes common sense) in favor of creating a lovable story.  But that is one of the joys of this book: it is an escape, a romance, a palace of dreams, airy turret upon airy turret (to quote Mara).<br />Some \\"historical\\" novels set in Egypt abound in lechery and dull historical details.  Perhaps they are more realistic.  In this case, however, the setting is merely the staging-area for a beautiful (and quite simple) story.  Therefore we can forgive (and once you get caught up in the book, overlook) whatever inaccuracies there may be.	2001-08-14

It's convicting, refreshingly true, and very, very challenging!  In such a small amount of words this book manages to say so much.  Not only are the shorter sayings very valuable, but Amy Carmichael's words in part 3 of the book are very inspiring as well.  It helped me realize the depth and breadth of Calvary love and how much I lack it!  I had never bought a book of sayings before (I guess I had a grudge against the Hallmark-quality of many of them), but this one blew me away.	2001-08-14

Anyone who has experienced disappointment and suffering should read it.  Instead of the usual ways of smothering pain with distractions, Larry Crabb presents to us a possibility not of shallow happiness, but of deep joy.  With sometimes painful honesty about suffering, Shattered Dreams isn't a feel-good kind of book, but it does offer hope: the hope of knowing God.<br />It's not a hard read; you could easily read it cover to cover without having to spend much time re-analysing passages.  Instead of offering academic doctrine the book points us away from knowing ABOUT God, but to knowing God Himself.	2001-08-14

While they are good books (and address some issues that relate more to our society), they can't hold a candle to &quot;Passion and Purity&quot;. Elizabeth Elliot writes from a lifetime (and 3 husbands..the first two died) of experience in relationships.  Her personal story is touching and inspiring and teaches some good principles.  While my first reaction to the concept of the &quot;passive&quot; woman was one of outrage, upon further readings in other books as well as the Bible, I believe that she has a point: feminism goes too far.  A man is a man, and a woman is a woman...there are real and profound differences. We women must also keep in mind that Ms. Elliot had an ideal relationship.  Her husband was a very Godly man with many leadership qualities and a great deal of strength that fits Ms. Elliot's passive-initiative mindset perfectly.  But in our day and age, such men are rare.  Women are obliged to grab the steering wheel when no one else is driving.  And after all, it is obvious that Ms. Elliot is herself a very strong woman with strong opinions. All said, this is a good book with many sound principles.  I believe that the main (and most important) point in the book was the unconditional surrender of our own desires to God's Will.  Ms. Elliot's story of romance, endurance and patience illustrates this submission to God beautifully.	2001-08-14

As I was reading, I almost laughed out loud, having read many more recent  books who have tried to duplicate the plot and philosophical views of Dune,  but just don't succeed compared to this!  I can see how it set the standard  for modern sci-fi.  In many ways, the Hyperion series by Dan Simmons is  very similar to it (Hyperion also won the Hugo award).  That is a good  series by the way.  And other popular series' have similar themes...on  reading Dune it becomes obvious where these authors got their ideas.  All I  can say is:  I bow to the master!	2000-03-18

Mr. Simmons has created a truly unique story.  6 pilgrims relate their stories on a journey to see the Lord of Pain, the legendary Shrike.  Vivid insights into the personalities of the characters (such as the ancient  Steinway piano in the consul's ship) and a very believable view of the  future make this book a masterpiece.  It is the kind of book which you have  to put down every now and then to catch your breath (but not for long!). I  finished it terrified, horrified, and craving more!  The Shrike is the most  intriguing and horrifying...well...thing.  And the stories catch your  imagination so that you are actually living and feeling along with the  characters.   This story is so different from much of the fluff that's out  there nowadays (David Eddings stuff) and is truly memorable.

An excellent novel about the coming of age of 3 children and their destinies.  Although the plot is not entirely unique, Ms. Wurts has a knack of vividly portraying her characters that makes us love them.  This is even  more evident in her more recent series, the Wars of Light and Shadow.  In  any case, the adventures of Jaric and Taen inspire hope and keep us in  suspense, and this remarkably talented author manages to create a world  without too much of the dreary detail that encumbers many other epic  fantasies.  A fresh and vivid tale that inspires the imagination.  (Ms.  Wurts' apparent fondness of the ocean is rather a distinguishing trait of  her works, don't you think?).	2000-01-10

Vicky is a sensitive and warm-hearted girl with real-life  problems and joys.  The beautiful poetry is the crowning touch.  Vicky's  confusion over the 3 boys is interesting and entirely understandable.  This book bursts with life and joy and hope, and really makes you think about the concept of  death.  A vivid celebration of life, it confirms the joy of living for old  and young alike.  This one's a keeper!	2000-01-10
