I read another review that said it was \\"awful\\" and \\"stupid\\". In fact, it is just the opposite: it is superb, with tons of up-to-date information! It's even got interviews with kids, which almost no Pokemon book has! Pokemon Future has FANTASTIC guides on the Gold/Silver versions and Pokemon Stadium and it has an UPDATED glossary with over 70 Pokemon words (this is VERY helpful for those who don't know a lot on Pokemon.) Plus to make a good book better, its got LOTS of information on the Pokemon Puzzle leauge, the Pokemon TV show and trading cards, a complete list of all 251 Pokemon, a chapter on the glitch Pokemon Missingno, helpful tips on \\"Hey you, Pikachu\\" starting on page 191, AND a page in the back of the book to draw your favorite Pokemon! A book couldn't  get much more informative about Pokemon than THIS one! I recommend you BUY this book!	2002-06-03
