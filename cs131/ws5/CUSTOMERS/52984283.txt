Anyone who has read books on the martial arts, the psychology of playing the stock market, \\"real\\" Zen Buddhism, or almost any self-improvement book will find much familiar territory here. Just because the advice is given a lot does not mean that the advice is bad. Stay in the \\"now,\\" concentrate, play your own game. Good advice. <br /> <br />Phillips has produced an easy read that covers topics like taking the long view, the importance of calmness, staying detached, getting into the rhythm of the game, not hesitating, respecting your opponents, and understanding why you are in the game in the first place. He peppers the chapters with quotes from Zen masters, athletes, and gamblers. <br /> <br />Reading parts of this book can be especially valuable when you're in the middle of one of those seemingly interminable runs of bad cards. Remember . . . a happy man is a man who grins. <br />	2005-08-20

Their goal, admirably met, is to help us understand the why and how of the document, rather than the what. They do this by introducing us to the institutions and customs of the England of the time, referring often to contemporary commentators.    In fourteen well-organized chapters they cover homes and architecture, the countryside, town life, education, family life, hunting, religion, the legal system, and other topics before turning to the Magna Carta itself only late in the book. They also debunk many of the myths surrounding the charter, which looms larger when viewed through the haze of the intervening years than it did at the time. This is a most interesting and informative read.	2005-08-17

The Aldhouse-Green's guide us through a panoramic tour of human history from the Paleolithic to the Middle Ages. They take us to caves, rock faces, and grave sites where there is material culture to be viewed. They present many interesting theories about how various artifacts can be explained by references to shamanism. Unfortunately, the theories are primarily speculation that could easily be explained in alternate ways.    As an example, they make a credible case for the religious significance of liminal (i.e. edgy---like rock faces, caves, shorelines, etc.) locations. They examine a particular case of handprints on a cave wall and \\"wonder . . . whether the hands depicted were reaching out to or from the world of spirits.\\" This is interesting speculation, as long as we don't apply similar analysis to finger painting sessions in kindergarten. There is simply no way to know. And so it is with virtually all of the explanations in this otherwise interesting book. If you are looking for hard answers, look elsewhere.    One niggling point is the production of the book. The paper is extremely heavy, thick, and shiny. Its shine produces reflections that sometimes make it hard to read when the light is directly behind you. That said, this book is very interesting, the speculations are clearly labeled as such, and I learned a great deal from reading it.	2005-08-16

It was as if le Carre had written 300 pages of a taut cold war thriller when the invasion of Iraq occurred, and he diverted the course of the story so that he could deliver a personal diatribe against American hyper-power hegemony. He would have been better served to use the subtlety and character development he is so famous for rather than stick-figure neo-con caricatures to deliver his message. <br /> <br />I have read every book that le Carre has ever written, and enjoyed most immensely.

First, it is a quite readable and informative biography of Louis Agassiz and his son Alexander. Second, it is an account of one of the longest-running controversies in the history of science. And, finally, it gives great insights to the current debate in the US over the teaching of \\"intelligent design.\\"<br /><br />Louis Agassiz was considered one of the world's greatest scientists (or natural philosophers as they were called at the time), and, after his migration to the United States from his native Switzerland, was viewed as America's greatest naturalist. He was a shrewd self-promoter who parlayed his explanation of glaciation and ice ages, and his encyclopedic knowledge of animal taxonomy, into a position of power and influence. However, he was a follower of Cuvier, and believed that species were created immutably by God. The fossil record was explained by a series of catastrophic annihilations (floods, ice ages) followed by divine creation of completely new species. Needless to say, he did not accept the theory of the origin of species by natural selection as propounded by Darwin. He and Darwin's followers engaged in heated, personal exchanges and attacks. In the end, however, Agassiz was nearly destroyed by the ensuing controversy, and his reputation and influence suffered severely.<br /><br />Alexander, on the other hand was more mild-mannered and consciously avoided being drawn into his father's fights. He was a widely respected naturalist and an expert on marine zoology, and privately accepted the truth of evolution. He had his own disagreement with Darwin, however, over Darwin's widely-accepted theory of the formation of coral reefs. While not nearly as destructive as his father's evolution dispute, the disagreement involved much publishing, many attacks, and the accumulation of reams of data supporting each side. The fact that this controversy was not settled authoritatively until core samples were taken on Eniwetok atoll before the nuclear tests of the 1950's, long after the protagonists were dead and buried, makes for an almost mystery novel-like tale.<br /><br />At times, the book reads like today's newspaper accounts of groups trying promote the teaching of creationism and intelligent design in our children's classrooms. Even though this debate was seemingly settled nearly 150 years ago, some ideas die hard.<br /><br />This is quite an enjoyable read.tok atoll before the nuclear tests of the 1950's, long after the protagonists were dead and buried, makes for an almost mystery novel-like tale.  <br /> <br />At times, the book reads like today's newspaper accounts of groups trying promote the teaching of creationism and intelligent design in our children's classrooms.

This book, however, I found to be imminently readable, and I felt the advice could be put into practice. The book is very logically organized, covering a system of play from pre-flop through river. It offers good advice on how to play most situations. The emphasis is on playing only premium hands, which don't come along that often; but playing them aggressively when they do.    I decided to put the system to the test by using \\"play money\\" on one of the online casinos, doing my level best to follow the advice in the book about which hands to play and how to play them. I played for 109 hours at $5-10, $10-20, and $25-50 tables, and kept track of my hourly performance. Over the period, I won $42,375 from a single $1,000 investment. My average hourly performance was winning 37.45 small bets. My worst hourly performance was losing 136 small bets. My best hourly performance was winning 210 small bets. Based on statistical standard deviation, 90% of the time I could expect my performance to range between losing 30 small bets and winning 105 small bets. I am a believer.	2005-07-30

I have played poker recreationally most of my life, and been a consistent winner--because my competition was even worse than I was. I even won in my sole foray into a card club--because I was lucky. I had never played Hold'em, however. I wanted to learn more than just the rules of the game and get an introduction to some of the theoretical poker concepts that I knew were out there. This is the wrong book for that. <br /> <br />This book is just too elementary for anyone but a total and complete novice. The only \\"take away\\" for me was an understanding of what playing tight pre-flop means for Hold'em. The commentary on post-flop play was way too simple-minded. <br /> <br />This book spends too much time explaining things like tournaments, the World Series of Poker, and the Internet. I am still looking for the book I want.	2005-07-12

My mind played over the objects in my life and my perceptions of them--shoe on sidewalk, air on skin, and even the sound waves bringing the blaring rap music to my ears from a teenager driving by. All these objects have qualities and values that my western mind assigns to them: the warm comfort when the heat of the sidewalk rises through the sole of my shoe to my foot, the pleasant coolness of the air on my skin, and the obnoxious assault on my ears from 110 decibels of mobile audio. But, at the quantum level, all is the same and indistinguishable, just as proclaimed by Buddha.<br /><br />By juxtaposing quotations from quantum physicists and Buddhist scholars, Thomas McFarlane shows us how prescient the eastern religions were, and how relevant they are for our quantum world. This is a truly wonderful, thought-provoking little book.	2005-06-27

Many practicing Christians would seem to believe that the precepts of their religion flow directly from the Bible's New Testament. Little could be further from the truth. In fact, the adoption of the Nicean creed and the doctrine of the Holy Trinity have more to do with personal animosities, competing church's quests for tax exemptions, and an emperor's desire simply to end the bickering than with anything found in the Gospels. <br /> <br />Freeman begins with a review of the Greek humanist tradition and its contributions to rational understanding of the world. He covers the history of philosophy, spending much time on Platonic forms and Neo-Platonism and how these ideas were adopted by early Christian thinkers. He then recounts the rejection of philosophy and science by the Apostle Paul, and later by St. Augustine, and how this rejection led to 1000 years of darkness. <br /> <br />The account of the adoption of the Nicean creed is  covered in such detail that following it is at times difficult. The hair-splitting nature of the arguments on both sides can be mind-numbing. More interesting is the account of the appropriation by the early church of many pre-existing traditions, customs, and infrastructure--including holidays, belief systems, and temples. The account of the relation of Mithraic birth myths to the Christian tradition is especially absorbing. Also quite interesting is the contribution of Thomas Aquinas to the end of the dark ages. <br /> <br />The central tenet of Christianity established in these early years, i.e. that faith should transcend reason, is still clearly a basis of the religion. We see it in efforts to equate \\"creation science\\" with evolution, as well as the traditional beliefs in virgin birth and resurrection. Fortunately, this tenet is no longer enforcedby an all-powerful church hierarchy. <br />	2005-06-26

In the previous volumes, magic was portrayed with a light hand--a mist that appears when needed or a line of heads on lances that keeps enemies at bay--that could be due as much to luck or human psychology as to magical abilities. In this third volume, however, the gloves are off, and Nimue and Merlin are revealed in fuller power. <br /> <br />The theme of the disappearance of magic coincident with the ascendency of Christianity is not new. It has been explored in other books and movies (see Dragonslayer, 1981, with Patrick MacNicol, Caitlin Clarke, and Ralph Richardson; set in the same era as this book). However, Cornwell does his usual masterful job in juggling this theme along with the Arthurian legend, character interactions, and brilliant combat depictions. This is a great end to the series, and well worth the read.	2005-06-26

This is the third book by Bernard Cornwell that I have read in a row. He is a brutally addictive author who entraps weak-willed bibliophiles like me, and entices them to read nothing else. Beware, or you could suffer the same fate. <br /> <br />While not quite as good as the first book in this series, it is still miles ahead of most of the genre. The tale begins with the pursuit of the Cauldron of Clyddno Eiddyn (pronounced kluthno aithun, I think), one of the thirteen \\"Treasures of Britain.\\" Merlin, Nimue, Derfel et al fight despair, the elements, and Diwrnach's minions to bring it back to Dumnonia. (As an aside, \\"Hamlet's Mill\\" by Santillana and Von Dechend offers some interesting insights into the relation of cauldron myths to primitive astronomy.) <br /> <br />The mid-portion of the book is the weakest part, and seems to meander meaninglessly. In fact, I seriously considered abandoning Cornwell for a time. Then comes the end which is the strongest part of the story by far. Don't make the mistake I did and start reading the last 150 pages at 11:30 PM before an important meeting the next day.

This book reminds me of Michael Chrichton's \\"The 13th Warrior\\" (originally \\"Eaters of the Dead\\"; the name was changed after release of the movie with Antonio Banderas and Omar Sharif). In that book, Crichton retells the Beowulf saga as it might really have occurred. Cornwell takes the same tack here with the Arthurian legend, but  with a considerably more satisfying result. <br /> <br />The story of Arthur is told through the eyes of Derfel, a Saxon captive raised by Merlin. He becomes an accomplished warrior in the service of Arthur, warlord of Dumnonia--one of the many minor kingdoms of Britain--and fights Saxons, Franks, and, most often, warriors from another of the Briton kingdoms. As usual with Cornwell, the battle scenes are terrific, the characters are believable, and the sense of accurate portrayal of the times is impeccable. <br />	2005-03-26

I was not disappointed with The Last Kingdom. It is not contrived, it does not have people acting outside of character to benefit the plot, and its descriptions of life in the times ring remarkably true. I can't wait for the sequel, and will likely dip into other Cornwell before it comes out. <br /> <br />The book tells the tale of the Danish invasion of Britain in the ninth century through the eyes of Uhtred, a Northumbrian ealdorman who is orphaned at age ten and sees his patrimony stolen by an uncle. Raised by his Danish captors, he grows into an accomplished warrior while grappling with conflicting loyalties and religious convictions.

The book revolves around the attempts of environmental extremists to create catastrophic events that will manipulate an ill-informed public into forcing radical action on global warming. The problem, which Crichton points out at every opportunity, is that the real evidence for global warming is ambiguous at best. For every \\"fact\\" that establishes that climate change is occurring, there are others that show that what we are seeing is normal variability. Most people accept global warming as an article of faith, without having any knowledge of the evidence for either side. A weakness of the book, however, is that the characters are often just mouthpieces for one view or another as Crichton tries to educate us on his version of the facts. <br /> <br />That said, I could not put the book down, and read it in one go while flying from Glasgow to San Jose. The hero is Peter Evans, attorney for enviro-philanthropist George Morton. Evans is an uncritical believer in global warming. The book is the story of how he is re-educated while helping an MIT professor/spook and his Nepalese sidekick foil the catastrophic plots cooked up by the environmental loonies. As long as you don't stop to question the obvious inconsistencies (like our heroes having the full support of the intelligence infrastructure in gathering data, but having to take on all the risky assignments by themselves), then you will thoroughly enjoy this read.  <br />	2005-02-14

"	If you were thinking that the War on Terror is going to be over any time soon, Harlan Ullman will quickly disabuse you of that notion. He rightly points out this is actually a War on Jihadist Extremism. Winning that war will require remedying the discontents that feed the extremism, and repositioning the United States government to be better able to do so. Most of the book is a rather dismal catalog of all the reasons for our failures to date. The background is great for those unfamiliar with this area, but sometimes the prose makes the phone book look enticingly entertaining by comparison.  <br /> <br />But what are the \\"10 Steps\\" promised in the subtitle? They are ambitious, indeed. The first is to stop thinking about a Global War on Terror (remember the wars on drugs and poverty?), and recognize that this is a war against Jihadist Extremism. That makes sense. Next, we must realize that the danger posed by the terrorists is not the buildings they might demolish, but the institutions they threaten to disrupt--like our economic system and our personal freedoms. That, also, is imminently logical. At this point, Dr. Ullman becomes more ambitious. We must also reorganize the White House, Congress, and Defense Department, commit billions and billions to bring the \\"Crescent of Crisis\\" into the 21st Century, and force government officials to sign pledges similar to those required by Sarbanes-Oxley so that they can be held responsible for their actions. If Dr. Ullman is correct in all of this, we are in for a truly long haul. <br />	2005-01-29

Otherwise you may be disappointed. Cartledge does not write typical histories where the subject is born, grows up, accomplishes what he/she does to become famous, and finally dies, all in nice chronological order. Cartledge prefers to explore various aspects of his subject in a non-chronological fashion. In \\"Alexander the Great\\", these aspects include: his relationship with the Macedonians, his relationship with the Greeks, his qualities as a general, his relationship with the Persians, his \\"divinity,\\" and the legends that have grown around him. In the process, Cartledge jumps around chronologically in a way that can be frustrating to someone unfamiliar with the subject. For me, the most interesting part of this book was the Appendix that outlines exactly what information the original sources contain. Few are contemporaneous, and many had political axes to grind. This sparseness of facts makes controversies like the \\"did he or didn't he\\" brouhaha created by the Oliver Stone movie almost ludicrously irrelevant.	2005-01-29

The book gave me the information I needed to get results without false starts. While the attempts at folksy humor can be a tad annoying, the prose is generally clear and understandable.

As my plane lifted off for the States, I was at first afraid that I had made a mistake. The style is much more like something from the Victorian era than 2004. However, I soon became entranced by the story, and the anachronistic prose just made it better for a long flight. The characters are well-developed, even when not totally credible, and the reader soon comes to care about their trials and tribulations. Mr. Williams displays a thorough knowledge of Chinese history as he paints a panoramic portrait of a country in turmoil.

Perhaps the reason it is so enjoyable is because it is more like a fictional potboiler than the typical dry historical tome. <br /> <br />Holland chronicles the last days of the Roman Empire and the lives of its principal players. The facts are all there, but so are many passages that purport to tell us what people were thinking, and what their inner motivations were. This is where serious students of history may have problems. However, for those of us simply looking for a good read, this presents few difficulties, and Holland's interpretations are certainly plausible. <br /> <br />There is a lot of hype in the preface about parallels between the Roman Empire and today's United States, and what lessons can be learned from the comparison. The book simply doesn't deliver on these promises, however, and one wonders why they were made in the first place. All in all, though, this book is well worth reading.	2004-10-30

While we may never know what John Kerry was doing while he wasn't attending Intelligence Committee meetings following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, at least we now know what he was thinking. He was thinking that the greatest threats faced by the United States were from the Japanese Yakuza, the Russian Mafiya [sic], and the Colombian drug cartels. <br /> <br />Even when he mentions Islamic terrorists, he is quick to equate them with the Branch Davidians, Montana Freemen, Timothy McVeigh, and Aum Shinrikyo. As Kerry points out at every opportunity, his early experience as a district attorney has taught him that these groups are best addressed as law enforcement problems. <br /> <br />Even a broken clock is right twice a day, and Kerry is no exception. Perhaps the most cogent comment in the entire book is found on page 182 (paperback edition) where he states, \\"In dealing with states that are outright criminal, the United States may at times need to take unilateral action . . .\\"  <br /> <br />Unfortunately for those who have struggled to retain consciousness during one of the Senator's speeches, this book is written with the same pompous phrasing and labored alliterations that Mr. Kerry seems to love so well. He is not the only politician to produce a collection of self-serving pap in an effort to build his credentials, but he has certainly produced a model of the genre.	2004-10-30

The first two are excellent; the third is disjointed and rather poorly written. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Spartan institutions and how they evolved over time. This, I believe, is the best part of the book. Especially interesting is Cartledge's account of the place of Spartan women in the culture. The mini-biographies of personages such as Demaratus, Brasidas, Lysander, and Gorgo were also informative and engaging. Unfortunately, the chronological history bogs down, jumps around, and generally suffers from a lack of focus and continuity. All in all, however, this book is still well worth reading. My advice is simply to scan or skip entirely the portions that drag.	2004-10-05

Personally, I most enjoyed learning more about Florence Nightingale and General \\"Chinese\\" Gordon. Manning and Arnold are simply more steeped in their own times and have, perhaps, less to offer to modern readers. <br /> <br />The section on Gordon is the best. It covers the end of his life at Khartoum in a much more interesting fashion than that portrayed by Charlton Heston in the movie. The modern problems in Darfur show that in many ways little has changed there in the last 120 years. <br /> <br />Strachey's style is to get behind the events of his subjects' lives to delve into their psychological motivations, and he is often less than kind to them. He frequently punctures their balloons and exposes their foibles in a very entertaining way.	2004-09-04

I knew nothing about Alexander McCall Smith. I was pleasantly surprised to be totally delighted with the book. The characters are believable and sympathetic, the plot is engaging, and the sense that we are being told the truth about place and culture is remarkable. When I read in last week's Economist magazine about Smith and how the series has sold over 5 million copies, I was not surprised. He deserves the success for giving us such a positive, rewarding reading experience.	2004-09-03

The fact that he has received a standing ovation at Cannes for his work proves that he is not stupid. It is the intelligence of his fans that should be questioned. Mr. Moore's biggest ally in his march to fame and fortune has been a total and conscious disregard for the truth. If, in fact, the allegations in his films were true, then he would deserve the acclaim he is getting. This book amply chronicles how Mr. Moore twists, bends, folds, and mutilates the truth with apparently no interest in presenting facts to his viewers. <br /> <br />Although the book was published prior to the release of Fahrenheit 9/11, the authors do a pretty good job of picking off the main points of the film. They were assisted in this task by Mr. Moore's track record of re-using material he has presented previously. Sure enough, he did it again. Many readers may be surprised, however, just how little respect for the truth Mr. Moore has.  <br /> <br />Putting Mr. Moore in the larger context of documentary (or propaganda) filmmakers, his work does not fare well. For example, who would compare the artistic merit of Fahrenheit 9/11 to \\"To Die in Madrid\\", \\"Hearts and Minds\\", or even Leni Riefenstahl's work?  What Mr. Moore does well is to exploit two large segments of the population: poorly-educated, mostly young X-Files watchers who are willing to believe stories about mysterious Saudi connections and the omnipotent Carlyle Group; and left wing intellectuals (or pseudo-intellectuals) who know this stuff isn't really true, but applaud Mr. Moore for saying it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Mr. Moore is simply another example of the decline of civil discourse and respect for the truth in this country. Until we stop rewarding people like Michael Moore, Ann Coulter, and Ted Rall for their outrageous and ridiculous statements, we deserve what we get. <br />	2004-08-31

What Lewis provides is an introduction to how difficult the question really is. He starts with a brief history of the interaction between Muslim countries and the West since the middle ages when the Middle East was home to the most advanced cultures on every front, from art to commerce and from science to human rights. While he proffers many anecdotes that highlight the attitudes that produced the decline of the Middle East, he settles on no clear answer. Why, for example, did it take several centuries for the printing press to become generally used in Islamic countries, even though it was well known?<br />Clearly, the initial arrogance and insularity of the Muslim countries gave the West a running head start once the Renaissance began, but that cannot be the complete explanation. Further, the suppression of women that leaves half the population as non-contributors also plays a role. One of the most promising lines of inquiry turns on the lack of an Islamic concept of separation of church and state such as that engendered in Christianity by the &quot;render unto Caesar&quot; text in the New Testament. By the end however, we are left with the conviction that there is no easy answer, and that the conflict between Islamic fundamentalists hell-bent on a return to the past and western societies intent on increasing, not decreasing, connectivity throughout the world will likely be with us for the rest of this century.	2004-06-27
US	52984283	R1WE1S5M52I14L	0385509510	418900469	Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith	Books	5	24	35	N	N	Bipolar responses	I am reposting my review of this book because I want to comment on the apparent voting patterns for reviews of this book. Virtually all of the reviews have a large number of negative votes. In my own case, this review originally received 13 positive votes and 37 negative votes. It seems that Mormons vote against all the positive reviews and gentiles vote against all the negative reviews. I am not really sure that this is constructive behavior. Let's see how this review does this time around. Here is the review . . .<br />My own experience with Mormons has been unfailingly positive. As a small Gentile (non-Mormon) child in Ogden, Utah, I noticed no difference between our neighbors and anyone else in the world. While visiting my daughter when she was in school in Utah, I found Mormons cheerful and hard-working. The Mormons I have met in my professional life have invariably been serious, capable individuals. Until reading this book, I knew nothing about the history of the faith outside of vague ideas about Joseph Smith, the emigration to Utah, and Brigham Young saying, &quot;We will make this valley blossom like a rose.&quot;<br />To say I was flabbergasted to learn the details of the history is a gross understatement. Joseph Smith emerges as a charlatan and a con-man, Brigham Young as a ruthless manipulator, and the Mormon pioneers as bloodthirsty villains who massacred over a hundred members of a passing wagon train. Polygamy is revealed to be little more than ill-disguised lechery (frequently incestuous), and a technique for keeping women under the thumb of a male-dominated theocracy.<br />The book entertwines a history of the church with the story of a recent murder of a woman and her infant child by two Mormon fundamentalist brothers. Sprinkled through the pages are interviews with various people who shed light on the inner workings of the fundamentalist sects. Reading the account of the murders, and hearing the statements of the brothers who did it, I was strongly reminded of another book that examines the relationship of crime to religion: Terror in the Mind of God, by Mark Juergensmeyer. Like Under the Banner of Heaven, this book chronicles what human beings can do when convinced they are on a &quot;mission from God.&quot;<br />In many ways, however, this book is about all religions. If we know that the Book of Mormon is a demonstrably false story seemingly concocted by a charismatic fanatic because it was written in historical times, what does it say about the Koran and the New Testament that were written prior to the invention of the printing press? There are no unflattering newspaper stories about Mohammed or Jesus that can be accessed by modern historians. In fact, what does it say about all of us, including myself, who believe in God?	2004-06-19

Santillana and von Dechend make a very compelling case for common knowledge of complex astronomy among primitive peoples worldwide, and that this understanding was transmitted through myth. For example, they demonstrate very convincingly that virtually all primitive cultures understood the precession of the equinox. Unfortunately all the references to myth-systems will keep all but the most well-read ethnologists either baffled or thumbing through the extensive appendices. This book would benefit immensely from a thorough editing job.	2004-06-16

If you are looking for usable market techniques, look elsewhere. However, for those with a classical bent, who enjoy the history of ideas and occasionally even wonder about topics more metaphysical than where the Dow closed today, this is a nice read. Mr. Taleb selects a few lessons from probability theory as applied to the markets, and illustrates them with characters drawn (presumably) from his own life or from his considerable literary knowledge. We learn, for example, why if we watch our portfolios too closely we may be unhappy even with a winning record, why working hard to get that home in the best neighborhood may make our lives miserable, and how our best hope against the depredations of Fortune is personal dignity. Read this for perspective, not portfolio advice.	2004-06-12

If you know enough about history to recognize that the current textbook version has bent, folded, and mutilated inconvenient facts to portray a world that never existed, this book is for you. If you believe that the United States has been a force for good in the world, and its history has been a continuous record of incremental righting of wrongs and improvement of the lot of minorities and women, then this book is for you.<br />However, if you believe that history should be rewritten to reflect current politically correct modalities, that children should be shielded from the fact that gross discrimination once existed, and that no one should ever be made the least bit uncomfortable by any language usage, then do not buy this book, unless you want you want your blood pressure raised and your mind expanded.<br />Ms. Ravitch has performed a public service by exposing to the clear light of day the process by which our children's textbooks are prepared. The book publishers, who are basically purveyors of ink and paper who only want to keep their content preparation and sales expenses as low as possible are happy to cede editorial control to pressure groups on the right and left that are reducing content to the lowest possible denominator. Reading her meticulously compiled accounts of the &quot;bias and sensitivity&quot; policies that have homogenized textbooks is a real eye-opener. Why, for example, is &quot;jungle&quot; a proscribed word? Why can't standard test questions mention owls, dinosaurs, mountains, or the seashore?<br />At root is a postmodern mentality that believes that confidence and self-esteem can only be instilled by examples from ones own ethnic group. To these thought police my own experiences of being inspired by Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Sitting Bull (sorry, I mean Tatanka Iyotake) are simplyincomprehensible. People must be judged not in the context of their time, but by today's PC standards. One wonders why they don't attack Isaac Newton because he did not invent the light bulb.<br />Fortunately, according to Ms. Ravitch, there may be a way out. She concludes the book with a three-step program for taking control back from the fringe elements. First, eliminate statewide selection of textbooks. Let local teachers and school boards select according to their perceived needs. Second, open the textbook selection process to public review. Require states to make the entire process transparent and documented on the internet. Third, make sure teachers are actually trained in the subjects they teach, as opposed to general education, so that they will have the knowledge needed to provide perspective.<br />This is an excellent book that should be read by every concerned parent. Thank you, Diane Ravitch!	2004-06-12

The strategic structure Barnett posits is based on his map of the world which divides countries between the Functioning Core and the Non-Integrating Gap. The Core includes North America, Europe, Russia, China, Japan, India, parts of South America, South Africa, and Australia. The Non-Integrating Gap includes those countries we normally think of as being in the third world. The Core is economically developed, offers personal freedom to its inhabitants, and is highly connected with the rest of the Core. The Gap is non-connected, poor, experiences little personal freedom, and has a number of \\"bad guy\\" rulers who make trouble for the Core.<br />Barnett's thesis is that the US should prepare for a twenty-first century mission of \\"shrinking the gap\\". Unfortunately, he finds us ill-prepared to do so. He points out that our military still has the cold war focus of preparing to engage a \\"near peer\\" foe using massed high tech weaponry. What is needed instead is a dual-mission force that can fight actions like Afghanistan and Iraq by applying overwhelming force against relatively unsophisticated foes, as well as provide the nation building expertise now woefully missing in Iraq.<br />Barnett is a Pentagon think tank type who has worked with Wall Street financial analysts to project what the security environment will be in this century. He concentrates on four flows: money, energy, population, and security. He sees the US as an exporter of security to the rest of the world. By the judicious application of force (read: get rid of Saddam, Kim Jong Il, and the ayatollahs) he believes the US can create a world in which poverty is decreased, personal freedom is increased, and connectivity serves as a ballast against disruptions of order.<br />A subtext of the book is Barnett's recounting of how policy is made in the Pentagon and how analysts vie for the \\"killer brief\\" as a path to influence and promotion. I seriously doubt that anyone will agree with all, or even most, of what Barnett presents. However, there is little doubt that his ideas are shaping the debate, and informed citizens would do well to acquaint themselves with them.	2004-06-02

It seems that it only takes a few episodes to deal with realistic scenarios, and we are left with ridiculous dust-ups involving the series regulars. I know that Nora Roberts is very popular, but there is not much here except for the story. The characters would seem one-dimensional in a comic book. In a work of fiction, they are triter than trite. The plot is certainly fast-moving, but it is truly hard to believe that there are people out there who will not figure out whodunit pretty early. If you are already a fan of the series, then by all means add this notch to your gunstock, but if you are new to it, try one of the earlier works first.	2004-05-30

When a brutally murdered body turns up during the Edinburgh Festival, Rebus starts our tour of the city's seamier underside. There are more than enough additional murders, beatings, pubs, slums, betrayals, and manipulations to satisfy any mystery fan. The story is taut, well-paced, and peopled by memorable, well-developed characters. Although there was a bit too much impenetrable British slang for my taste, it certainly adds credibility and color to the tale. Pour yourself a single-malt, sit back, and enjoy the ride.	2004-05-13

All of us who have attacked the markets using technical analysis do so because we believe in the fundamental tenets of TA: 1) everything is discounted and reflected in market prices, 2) prices move in trends and trends persist, and 3) market action is repetitive. If only it were that easy. This book by Alan Farley, and his website [...] are dedicated to disabusing amateurs of the notion that making money in the markets is easy. In fact, most practitioners don't make money following TA. That said, if you are still intent on pitting yourself against the pros, then by all means read, study, and reread this book.<br />Farley's concept of the pattern cycle, his demand that every signal be cross verified, and his emphasis on time and preparation should be part of the arsenal of any serious practitioner. Perhaps the most valuable contribution of this book, however, is as a challenge to the trader. Unless you are able to read it, reread it, and comprehend all of it, you have no business risking capital in swing trading.	2004-04-22

Damon enters the Army as a private and works his way up through the ranks. Massengale enters as an officer through West Point. Damon works at his job. Massengale works the system. Damon is loyal to his men. Massengale is loyal to himself. For those of us who have worked in organizations, these two characters are quite familiar. Anton Myrer separates them in a very black-and-white, yin-and-yang fashion, although most real people evince each behavior pattern at different times. This turns &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; into a morality play that puts our own foibles at the forefront. Who do you want to be, after all, Sam Damon or Courtney Massengale? Myrer does all this while maintaining a page-turning pace in a very readable story. I highly recommend this book.	2004-04-15

He was standing guard duty on the Panama Canal when Pearl Harbor was attacked. He shipped out almost immediately for the South Pacific as part of the First Marine Division. He served on Guadalcanal and Bougainville. That is almost the entire extent of my knowledge of my father's World War II experiences. Although I lived with him until I went away to college, he just didn't talk about it. Reading this book by James Bradley helped me to understand that I am not alone in this experience. <br />Our fathers' generation fought a war without daily body counts on the evening news, without &quot;embedded&quot; journalists, and without carping from the home front about why they shouldn't be there. They fought it quietly and stoically. They won their war, and the survivors came home to get back to the business of being human. This is a great book with many lessons for a country facing a war against terrorism. May God grant that we fight it as effectively, successfully, and heroically as our fathers' generation fought their war.	2004-04-04

His begins by looking at terrorists from five religious groups--Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, and Buddhism. His Buddhist example, the Aum Shinrikyo cult attack on the Tokyo subway system is probably the weakest example. He may have been better served to have a separate section on cults such as this and others like the Branch Davidians. They seem to have as much in common with each other as with other groups within their religions.<br />He next looks for common themes from all of his examples. He does well when he explains how all of the terrorists believe they are warriors in a larger cosmic drama of good and evil. He does less well in separating the parts played by religion and politics. For example, was Timothy McVeigh a religious terrorist or a political terrorist?<br />All in all, this is an engrossing, if disturbing study. We are left feeling that there will be little relief from religious terrorism in the near future. Those seeking more insight on this subject should read &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; by Jon Krakauer, which examines these topics among Mormon Fundamentalists.	2004-04-03

First, attempt to explain the content in nontechnical language. Second, concentrate on the personages involved and help us relate to them as human beings. Aczel fails on both counts. He barely even attempts to cover the technical issues involved. Readers will come away from this book knowing virtually nothing about the mathematics entailed in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, other than that it builds on topics developed over thousands of years by many contributors. He can hardly be faulted for this, since the math required for understanding the proof is extremely dense and well beyond the capacity of any but graduate-level mathematicians.<br />It is on the personal level that Aczel really fails. His descriptions of most of the mathematicians covered read as if they had been lifted from a poorly-written encyclopedia. He glosses over them and their work so lightly that we are left completely unsatisfied. The question is, &quot;Why?&quot; He could have extended the book beyond its scant 137 pages and given us more detail about the players and explained some of the simpler mathematics. This would have produced a much better book.<br />The reason why this book gets three stars, instead of one, is its coverage of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil-Serre controversy. This is actually interesting and reasonably well-written. If this had been excerpted and placed in a Sunday supplement, it would have been an admirable effort. The net is that if you want to know anything about the mathematics, or details about the people, look elsewhere. If you only want to know the barest outline of what all the fuss is about, this will suffice.	2004-03-20

First, can historiometric techniques be used to produce a survey of human accomplishment in the arts and sciences over time and across cultures? Second, are there any obvious patterns in the data? And third, why are those patterns present?<br />The answer to the first question is certainly \\"yes\\". Murray uses the extent of coverage of scientists and artists in standard reference works on each field that he investigates. Basically he counts the number of times figures are mentioned and the amount of space their work is given. He makes a heroic effort to ensure that the results are not skewed by reliance on single works or works in a single language. His inventories include: astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth sciences, physics, mathematics, medicine, technology, Chinese philosophy, Indian philosophy, western philosophy, western music, Chinese painting, Japanese art, western art, Arabic literature, Chinese literature, Indian literature, Japanese literature, and western literature.<br />While many may deride this methodology as bunk, the surprising thing is that the listings \\"look right\\". Who will argue that Galileo and Kepler do not belong at the top of the astronomy list, that Newton and Einstein do not belong at the top in physics, or that Shakespeare and Goethe should be lower on the western literature list? We may quibble about minor differences in rankings, but few would assert that obviously significant figures have been completely misplaced. Some readers with extensive statistics backgrounds may attack the techniques used, especially those used later in the book in determining rates of accomplishment, but with my limited background (one year of undergraduate statistics courses at MIT, and a semester of statistics for research in grad school) Murray's methodology looks bulletproof.<br />To this point, even multiculturalists should be happy, since no attempt is made to compare the accomplishments of western and non-western civilizations. Now, however, he lobs the baseball into the hornets' nest. He concludes that dead European white guys have done the best work in the sciences, that Jews are dramatically overrepresented as a percentage of total population, that women have not contributed at the expected rates even after sexist barriers were removed, and that significant contributions in non-western arts have not been made at the same rates as in the west. While Murray's observations on the sciences seem indisputable, his coverage of non-western art is probably the weakest part of the book.<br />Murray next tries to extract some explanations from the data. His first conclusions are fairly obvious and noncontroversial to anyone with some knowledge of the history of sicence and the arts: war does not disrupt accomplishment, but economic health is required. Next, he points out that models of accomplishment provide behavior reinforcement for aspiring achievers. He also concludes that accomplishment requires freedom of action. Regimes ruled by Saddam Hussein's or Ayatollah Khomeini's are unlikely to produce much in the way of achievement. Further, Confucian duty to family and hierarchy can also stifle creativity.<br />In the final section of the book, Murray turns back to the nature of accomplishment and the factors that contribute to it, and asks if accomplishment is in decline. Since this is the most interesting part of book, I will not telegraph all of the conclusions in this review. Suffice it to say that his conclusions are anathema to multiculturists and practititioners of literary theory. In sum, this is an excellent, thought-provoking work that will reward any open-minded reader.d non-western civilizations. Now, however, he lobs the baseball into the hornets' nest.

As a small Gentile (non-Mormon) child in Ogden, Utah, I noticed no difference between our neighbors and anyone else in the world. While visiting my daughter when she was in school in Utah, I found Mormons cheerful and hard-working. The Mormons I have met in my professional life have invariably been serious, capable individuals. Until reading this book, I knew nothing about the history of the faith outside of vague ideas about Joseph Smith, the emigration to Utah, and Brigham Young saying, &quot;We will make this valley blossom like a rose.&quot;<br />To say I was flabbergasted to learn the details of the history is a gross understatement. Joseph Smith emerges as a charlatan and a con-man, Brigham Young as a ruthless manipulator, and the Mormon pioneers as bloodthirsty villains who massacred over a hundred members of a passing wagon train. Polygamy is revealed to be little more than ill-disguised lechery (frequently incestuous), and a technique for keeping women under the thumb of a male-dominated theocracy.<br />The book entertwines a history of the church with the story of a recent murder of a woman and her infant child by two Mormon fundamentalist brothers. Sprinkled through the pages are interviews with various people who shed light on the inner workings of the fundamentalist sects. Reading the account of the murders, and hearing the statements of the brothers who did it, I was strongly reminded of another book that examines the relationship of crime to religion: Terror in the Mind of God, by Mark Juergensmeyer. Like Under the Banner of Heaven, this book chronicles what human beings can do when convinced they are on a &quot;mission from God.&quot;<br />In many ways, however, this book is about all religions. If we know that the Book of Mormon is a demonstrably false story seemingly concocted by a charismatic fanatic because it was written in historical times, what does it say about the Koran and the New Testament that were written prior to the invention of the printing press? There are no unflattering newspaper stories about Mohammed or Jesus that can be accessed by modern historians. In fact, what does it say about all of us, including myself, who believe in God?	2004-03-17

Take a labored premise, adolescent dialog, and &quot;Wile E.

Further, if you have ever suspected that the arcane jargon created by \\"theory\\" practitioners is little more than obfuscation to ensure that their more outrageous pronouncements will be immune from refutation by intelligent but uninitiated outsiders, this book will do little to dissuade you. Nonetheless, if you want an approachable explication of what \\"theory\\" is all about, this is the book for you. Professor Culler does not argue the case for a particular school of thought, but explains (eschewing jargon when possible) the underlying currents of thought that drive literary analysis today. He starts by explaining the inextricable connection of literature theory to cultural studies and proceeds to explore the ramifications of that marriage. He then examines how literature theory attempts to answer questions about the nature of self, language, and meaning. To ensure that no single movement is given precedence, short descriptions of the tenets of the various schools are relegated to an appendix. The sheer number of approaches listed is breathtaking -- Russian Formalism, New Criticism, Phenomenology, Structuralism, Post-Structuralism, Deconstruction, Feminist Theory, Psychoanalysis, Marxism, New Historicism/Cultural Materialism, Post-Colonial Theory, Minority Discourse, and Queer Theory. So, if you simply want to know what all the \\"fuss\\" is about, or if you want to embark on a more serious study, start here.	2004-02-01

His ability to keep this complex narrative going while jumping across five decades and generations of technology is truly breathtaking. Despite stilted dialog (including his penchant for having characters engage in conversations solely for the purpose of educating readers about things he thinks they probably don't know), we really care about the characters and their predicaments. Stephenson's command of language and his descriptive passages are a joy to experience. Even though there are a few issues like inaccurate references to The Lord of the Rings and mangled scientific facts (the speed of sound in air is not one kilometer per second), Stephenson reveals himself to be a polymath with impressive knowledge of history, literature, and technology. The only really weak part of the book is the ending, but readers who have thoroughly enjoyed the preceeding 1100 pages will probably not be overly disappointed.	2004-01-25

For fans of &quot;Connections-style&quot; history of science, this is a great read. It does an especially good job of chronicling the interplay between math and physics, and how general relativity could not be developed until the appropriate mathematical constructs were available. Using the cosmological constant as the common thread in exploring how general relativity has shaped our understanding of the evolution of the universe lets Aczel pull everything together in a most satisfying way. There are some weak points, however. Sprinkling a few equations in the text does nothing to clarify his explanations and gives a simplistic view of the real mathematics involved, and his inclusion of irrelevant biographical details of minor players is a bit exasperating. Nonetheless, most readers will find this time well spent.	2003-12-30

II: Eminent Historians Imagine What Might Have Been	Books	4	2	2	N	N	History as the actions of individuals	As someone who has been an avid amateur student of history for 50 years, I have been dismayed by the current trend toward the \\"de-individualization\\" of history. When I read biographies of Davy Crockett, Crazy Horse, Cyrus, Galileo, Peter the Great, and others as a child, I developed the distinct impression that history was shaped by the actions of individuals in the context of their times. Only later, as an adult perusing my children's history books, did I learn that I was out of step with modern historiography. Their textbooks devoted as much, or more, print to those who were simply present as to those who drove events. What If 2 provides a much-needed refutation of this \\"modern\\" trend. Counterfactual history offers potent arguments against those who explain everything in terms of broad historical forces. Any thinking person must admit that history would have been very different if Antony and Cleopatra had won at Actium, if Jesus had not been crucified, if the Franco-Prussian War had not been fought, or if Lenin had not made it to the Finland Station. Most of the essays in this collection are well-expostulated explorations of alternative timelines such as these. Unfortunately, the quality is uneven. My advice: if a selection starts to drag, skip to the next one. It will be better.	2003-08-20

He delivers again in this jewel box life of Winston Churchill.<br />The brevity of this work is actually an advantage for Keegan. He is free to concentrate on motivation and character, rather than chronicling the enormous record of Churchill's life. Those interested in detail would be much better served by Martin Gilbert's \\"Churchill\\", or even Churchill's own \\"The Second World War\\". By concentrating on themes of Churchill's life like his use of language, belief in the manifest destiny of the English-speaking peoples, and strength of character even when beset by physical ailments, Keegan paints a vivid, personal portrait of one of the greatest leaders of the modern era.	2003-05-24

If you know enough about history to recognize that the current textbook version has bent, folded, and mutilated inconvenient facts to portray a world that never existed, this book is for you. If you believe that the United States has been a force for good in the world, the history of which is a continuous record of incremental righting of wrongs and improvement of the lot of minorities and women, then this book is for you.<br />However, if you believe that history should be rewritten to reflect current politically correct modalities, that children should be shielded from the fact that gross discrimination once existed, and that no one should ever be made the least bit uncomfortable by any language usage, then do not buy this book, unless you want you want your blood pressure raised and your mind expanded.<br />Ms. Ravitch has performed a public service by exposing to the clear light of day the process by which our children's textbooks are prepared. The book publishers, who are basically purveyors of ink and paper who only want to keep their content preparation and sales expenses as low as possible are happy to cede editorial control to pressure groups on the right and left that are reducing content to the lowest possible denominator. Reading her meticulously compiled accounts of the \\"bias and sensitivity\\" policies that have homogenized textbooks is a real eye-opener. Why, for example, is \\"jungle\\" a proscribed word? Why can't standard test questions mention owls, dinosaurs, mountains, or the seashore?<br />At root is a postmodern mentality that believes that confidence and self-esteem can only be instilled by examples from ones own ethnic group. To these thought police my own experiences of being inspired by Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Sitting Bull (sorry, I mean Tatanka Iyotake) are simply incomprehensible. People must be judged not in the context of their time, but by today's PC standards. One wonders why they don't attack Isaac Newton because he did not invent the light bulb.<br />Fortunately, according to Ms. Ravitch, there may be a way out. She concludes the book with a three-step program for taking control back from the fringe elements. First, eliminate statewide selection of textbooks. Let local teachers and school boards select according to their perceived needs. Second, open the textbook selection process to public review. Require states to make the entire process transparent and documented on the internet. Third, make sure teachers are actually trained in the subjects they teach, as opposed to general education, so that they will have the knowledge needed to provide perspective.<br />This is an excellent book that should be read by every concerned parent. Thank you, Diane Ravitch!	2003-05-03

First, a Horatio Alger story of the boy from Philadelphia who rises to the top of Wall Street. Second, an inside story of what it was like to found a dotcom during the internet bubble. And third, an account of how the stress of running a hedge fund drove an otherwise decent guy to be a real Mr. Hyde. Amazingly, the book works on all three levels.<br />On the first count, Cramer shows that hard work and monomaniacal interests can take a person to Harvard, to running the Harvard Crimson, to sleeping in one's car, to being a top producer at Goldman Sachs, and to founding a money-minting hedge fund. This Cramer is clearly the most likeable, and is nice to know about as you watch him with Larry Kudlow.<br />Cramer the entrepreneur is fascinating on multiple levels. As he recounts his adventures with VC's and recruited management, he displays a naiveté that is truly jaw dropping. I have been involved with a number of VC-funded start-ups, and I always thought that Wall Street types like Cramer understood how the game is played. The fact that he was so befuddled by it helps to explain how the internet bubble fooled so many of his colleagues.<br />Finally, there is Cramer the hedge fund manager. Cramer became so enraptured with this role that he let everything else in his life go-from simple courtesy to friendships to his family. If Cramer was even half as nasty as he describes, his wife must be one of the saintliest women of our era to put up with him. The fact that he recognized what was happening to him and walked away while at the top of his game, before dropping dead of a stress-induced coronary, puts the icing on the Cramer cake.	2003-02-26

If you are looking for usable market techniques, look elsewhere. However, for those with a classical bent, who enjoy the history of ideas and occasionally even wonder about topics more metaphysical than where the Dow closed today, this is a nice read. Mr. Taleb selects a few lessons from probability theory as applied to the markets, and illustrates them with characters drawn (presumably) from his own life or from his considerable literary knowledge. We learn, for example, why if we watch our portfolios too closely we may be unhappy even with a winning record, why working hard to get that home in the best neighborhood may make our lives miserable, and how our best hope against the depredations of Fortune is personal dignity. Read this for perspective, not portfolio advice.	2003-01-27

Laura Jadwin, nee Dearborn, tells most of the story. Her inner conflict between self-centered materialism and desire for \\"perfect\\" love forms the backdrop to the financial saga enmeshing her husband, Curtis. All in all, this is a good read but may move too slowly for some people--except for the climax of Jadwin's corner of the wheat market, which is as fast-paced as a Clancy novel.	2003-01-13

Through it's detailed history of the changes in fashion and mission in the United States' intelligence agencies, we begin to understand why the human intelligence assets were not in place to predict September 11, why we are often surprised by events in North Korea, and the challenges faced in creating the Department of Homeland Security. Johnson gives an even-handed, largely non-political view of these issues. It is refreshing to read an account written by someone with no apparent axe to grind.	2003-01-03

Do read it if you want to sit with a successful trader and get a hint of what it's like to live by trading.<br />Mr. Oz impressively made 32% on his account during the crash of April 2000 when the NASDAQ dove by 30%. He did it without shorting and by trading only the hard hit tech sector. The strategy he used was basically the \\"buy on the dip\\" technique that worked so well during the historic run-up. However, this feat is not the \\"take-away\\" from this book.<br />The real lesson is risk management. First, Tony is ruthless about leaving bad trades without afterthought or regret. Even when the stock bounds up shortly after he sells, he affirms that he did the right thing by exiting when he did. He always enters a stop loss as soon as he enters the trade, and raises it as soon as feasible. Those of us who have learned this lesson the hard way can only admire his intestinal fortitude. Second, Tony almost never hits his target for a trade. He almost always exits sooner, but he preserves his profits. Mastering these two seemingly simple lessons is what separates the real money-makers from those who finance them.	2002-10-11

Along the way he paints a broad-brush canvas of the entire Italian Renaissance.<br />Brunelleschi's construction techniques were nothing short of revolutionary, although many may have been reverse engineered from his Roman Empire predecessors. His personality was almost a caricature of the Renaissance genius--gifted, quirky, paranoid, and secretive. He and his contemporaries come alive as they compete for commissions, take time out for wars, and play practical jokes on rivals.<br />But, the most fascinating part of the story is the design and construction of the dome itself. As an engineer, I found myself asking, \\"How did he know how to do that?\\"	2002-10-05

It may, indeed, contain some important new ideas. Unfortunately, the authors did not elect to share them with us. The language is simply too dense. Hardt and Negri could have performed a service by explaining their concepts to a wider audience. They chose, instead, to cloak their arguments in impenetrable jargon and ensure they could only be decyphered by those already in possession of a postmodernist code book. Was their decision from arrogance or fear? Make it their loss, not yours. Save your money.	2002-09-02
