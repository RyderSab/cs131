These differences are what make the book as good as it is. In the book, right after Pongo and his wife Missus Pongo have their 15 puppies, everyone is worried about how one dog will feed 15 puppies without losing strength. The solution to their problem comes in the form of a stray Dalmatian, found on the side of the road, whom they name Perdita. Perdita has a history of her own, and her sub-plot is one of the many things that add depth to the story, but were lost in the movie.<br /><br />The story is told, continuously, from a dog's point of view. It is mentioned how humans believe that they own dogs; whereas the truth is that the dogs own them. Pongo and Missus continually refer to their humans as their pets, and one can see that mentality in their conversations. All the dogs in the story seem to enjoy doting on their humans. Another interesting quirk is how the dogs are `married'. Pongo continually refers to Missus as his wife, and she calls him husband. A dog's marriage ceremony does not seem to take very long, or require a priest or government official. Two willing dogs can run off into the forest, and when they come back, be married. Puppies will most likely come soon after.<br /><br />Throughout the book are scattered illustrations.

Little of the book remains intact in the movie. The book starts with Shrek's parents hissing things over, and they decide to send Shrek \\"out in the world [to do] his share of damage\\". Shortly after he leaves home, Shrek meets with a witch who tells him his fortune in exchange for a few of Shrek's lice. Shrek is told that he will wed a princess who is even uglier than he, and is overjoyed at the news. On his way to the princess, Shrek meets a peasant, confronts thunder and lightning, defeats a dragon, has a nightmare of being loved by children, and meets a donkey who takes him to the castle. After defeating a knight he goes and meets his princess. The two get married and live horribly ever after.<br /><br />The story is well told, and I love how Shrek breaks out in rhyme at the sight of his princess. The words flow well, and the book is fun to read out loud.<br /><br />The illustrations of Shrek are, by necessity, ugly. Even more so than the movie. That said, they are also cute, though not in the huggable/loveable sense. The illustrations are colorful, fun, and expressive. A great book, even if (or especially since?) it isn't the movie.<br /><br />Loggie-log-log-log	2005-08-12

This dilemma (or rather the dilemma of six naked geese) confronts Agatha as she snuggles down for the first time in her brand new feather bed. The geese whose feathers she's sleeping on are not happy with the current state of events, and tell Agatha so. Seeing the justice of the geese's complaints, Agatha makes the geese warm, fluffy white coats to wear until their feathers grow back.<br /><br />This story loses much of its charm in a summary. The best part of the story is the idioms it uses. Agatha is a spinner and a storyteller: \\"She can spin a yarn better than anyone I know\\". That quote is just one of the many examples of the common phrases that take on a new meaning when talking to geese. That is what makes this book so special. Other than that, the story is told well; it flows nicely and is easy to read out loud.<br /><br />The illustrations are beautiful, but different. They abound with detail, and on each page is a box with a picture of a raw material, and what it is made into. (Cotton boll, cotton. Dinosaurs, fossil fuel.) The pictures are very expressive, very detailed, beautiful, and fun. A great story.<br /><br />Loggie-log-log-log	2005-08-12

Cinderella is so dainty, so beautiful; her sisters are made even uglier in comparison. (Though it is hard to be anything but ugly when your nose sticks out for a finger length from your face.) The lines surrounding Cinderella are softer, and nowhere near as hash and angular as those used for the stepsisters. The illustrations are simply superb.<br /><br />The main problem with this book (the reason I deem it 4, and not 5, stars) is that there aren't enough pictures. The story is broken up over the pages poorly, and each page has a great deal of the story. On one set of facing pages we go all the way from the stepsisters mocking Cinderella for wanting to go to the ball, to Cinderella on her way to the ball, all with one picture. Fewer words per page, more pages, and more thought to where the turning of the page is placed would improve this book immensely. Otherwise, it is a very good retelling.<br /><br />Loggie-log-log-log	2005-08-10

Our copy got so beat up that by the time my sister came around we had to get another. We were disappointed to find that the original version was no longer being produced. This version is several pages shorter, but still contains much of the original charm.<br /><br />The plot is very simple. \\"Many animals live on the farm. There are ducklings and ducks. There are kids and goats. But... are there hippos on the farm?\\" This question is repeated for several different animals, but the hippo gets top billing. A nice thing about the book is the way it gives the baby and adult name for each type of animal encountered. (Ducklings and ducks, calves and cows.)<br /><br />The illustrations are very cute and colorful, even if they are not completely correct in what a hippo looks like.

It takes them a while to realize that there are no birthday parties here, since in Neverland one never grows up. The boys quickly get over this disappointment, but Wendy tries explaining to Peter how important they are, and finally Peter consents to have a party. There are three people listening to the conversation though, Captain Hook, Smee (another pirate), and Tinkerbell. Hook decides to capture Wendy so that he can have a party, and Tink is disgusted by the idea of a party. Hook goes ahead and captures Wendy. When Michael notices she is gone and starts crying for her, Tink teams up with Peter to go rescue her. Wendy and the boys then decide that there are some benefits of growing up, and go home.<br /><br />Personally I don't like Disney's sequels to a story, partly because they completely change it, a perfect example being this book. Instead of a cheerful jaunt, and a decision to go home because they miss Mother, they go home because they want a birthday party. The story is told well though, and flows nicely.<br /><br />The illustrations are a lot like Disney's movie, but simpler, and don't give the same feel. Wendy's face bothers me, but I can't figure out why.<br /><br />In short, this book isn't worth the effort of finding a copy. Disney wrote a Peter Pan book 12 years before this one, which is infinitely better.<br /><br />Loggie-log-log-log	2005-08-03

Rhodopis, a Greek slave, is picked on by the Egyptian servants in her master's household. She befriends the animals, and dances for them often. One time, her master saw her dancing and was so impressed that he gave her a pair of slippers gilded in rose-red gold.<br /><br />When the servant girls go to visit the pharaoh, Rhodopis is left behind to do the washing. A falcon steals one of her slippers, and brings it to the pharaoh, who decides to search for and marry the girl whose foot fits the slipper.<br /><br />The suddenness of the pharaoh deciding to search for and marry Rhodopis annoys me, but other than that the story is told very well, and the words flow nicely. The illustrations in this book are very beautiful, but slightly different from those I am used to. The manner in which animals and plants appear on every page, especially when Rhodopis is around, is a nice touch.<br /><br />This book is a good variant on a popular story, and the pictures make it very memorable.

The penguins are very round, and pretty much egg-shaped, but what makes the illustrations really cute is the fuzziness (the penguins look like balls of fluff) and lack of definition between everything- almost like a beginning watercolor.

As the book is much shorter than the movie a lot of detail is lost, but it is still a good story that is told pretty well. The sentences are short and slightly choppy, something that seems to be universal in Disney's books from the early 1970's.<br /><br />The illustrations are very similar to the animation, just slightly simpler and with no depth/shading. The people's faces do a good job in the book, as well as in the movie, of showing the characters feelings through facial expressions. They are bold and colorful, and do a very good job of showing the story.<br /><br />In short, if you are looking for a companion picture book for Disney's movie, than this is your book. It also stands well on its own, though one or two things may seem slightly random and not quite make sense at first. All in all, this is a good book.<br /><br />Loggie-log-log-log	2005-01-06

In this version a princess is born, and the Queen decides to give a party. Many people are invited to the party, as well as three fairies. At the party, right after the first two fairies had given their gifts, an evil fairy that wasn't invited bursts in and says the princess will die in her 16th year. Then she disappears. The third fairy, the one who hasn't given her gift yet, changes it so that she will only sleep until a prince rescues her. Sure enough, she pricks her finger on a spindle, and falls asleep until a prince rescues her. No mention is made of her life between the day she was born and the day she pricks her finger, which annoys me, but is not necessary to the plot.<br /><br />The illustrations are very like the animated movie, but slightly simpler. For the most part the illustrations are very expressive, and do a wonderful job of conveying the intended expression. There is one instance however, where it looks as if the prince's horse is trying to flirt with the dragon the prince in trying to slay, and I doubt that this was intentional.<br /><br />The wording is simple, straightforward, and it flows well. The sentences tend to be short, but that doesn't impede the flow much, or at all detract from the book, which is very good.<br /><br />I must give Disney credit for actually having a spindle to prick her finger on. All too often books have pictures of a small spinning wheel with a design that has no spindle. This wheel, while it is a small one, has a spindle on it to help with spinning flax, so it is actually possible for her to have pricked her finger on the wheel shown. Good job Disney!<br /><br />Loggie-log-log-log	2005-01-06

For many of Disney's animated movies, Disney has also created a picture book. This picture book version of Peter Pan, though created by Disney, does not match the movie. In this version Wendy reads a story to her brothers. The story contains all of the same adventures as the movie, just without Wendy and her brothers. The lost boys go Indian hunting and get caught, Peter Pan rescues the Indian princess Tiger Lily, Tinkerbell gets captured, and more.<br /><br />The story is told well and flows nicely. My only complaint is that the sentences tend to be short. \\"It was the best time of day. The lamps were lighted in the bedroom. Wendy sat by the fire.\\" Or \\"Peter and Tink lived in Neverland. It was a magic place. Indians camped in the woods. There was a pirate ship in the bay near Skull Rock. And there was Hangman's Tree.\\" Other than the short sentences, the book is worded well.<br /><br />As Disney made this book, one would expect the illustrations to be straight from the movie, but they're not. (Partly because the book was made before the movie.) The pictures seem to be slightly simpler, slightly older. They also contain a lot of spirit and expressiveness. While the pictures are slightly different form the movie, they are still obviously the same people. The biggest differences are in the faces- very little about the bodies changes.<br /><br />If you are looking for a shortened form of the movie, this is not the book you want. It is however a very good story full of adventure, good friendship and great illustrations.<br /><br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-11-13

This sweet little book tells the story of a little boy and his pony, Little Black. The boy loves his pony, but one day he decides to try and ride a horse named Big Red. Big Red can run faster, jump higher and is in general more exciting to ride than Little Black. But each time Big Red is chosen over Little Black, Little Black gets sadder and sadder, until he runs away one winter morning. The boy rides Big Red to try and get his pony, and ends up trying to cross a frozen river. The ice breaks under Big Red and the two fall. Big Red manages to escape to the bank, but cannot save the boy. Little Black finally finds something he can do that Big Red can't, and saves the boy's life. The little boy then pledges to ride only Little Black from now on, and the book ends.<br /><br />The story is told form the little boy's point of view. It flows very well; with only one or two spots I would have phrased something differently. The author also tends to use short sentences; \\"Then I saw something on the bank. Something in the trees! It was Little Black. He saw me in the water.\\"<br /><br />The illustrations in this book are wonderful. Everything -the horses and people- is very expressive. You can see the sadness in Little Black when the boy doesn't ride him. You can see the boy's fear when he is in the river. You can see Little Black's pride in saving him. All these emotions are portrayed beautifully. The pictures are not very detailed, but they are shaded wonderfully. The illustrator must have been very knowledgeable about horses as well, as these horses look alive.

If you are looking for a book with a smart heroine with common sense who doesn't just wait for her prince to save her, you will have trouble beating Elizabeth, the Paper Bag princess. In this story Elizabeth is betrothed to a prince named Ronald. When a dragon comes along and smashes her castle, burns her clothes and carries off Ronald, Elizabeth doesn't just sit crying in the ashes, but decides to go save her love Ronald. Sadly all she can find to wear is a paper bag, so she dons that and follows the trail of burnt forests and horses bones left in the dragon's wake. Through several tricks Elizabeth manages to outwit the dragon and incapacitate him. Ronald however, doesn't seem to appreciate her efforts. His warm welcome to Elizabeth goes something like this: \\"Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled and you are wearing a dirty old paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess.\\" What makes this book one of the best books written is Elizabeth's response \\"Ronald, your clothes are really pretty and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are a bum.\\"<br /><br />The illustrations are wonderful. They are bright, colorful, bold and expressive. The dragon is exactly as I would imagine a dragon to look like. The story is told in a very straightforward, simple manner that endears it to me.<br /><br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-07-29

In this book we see what happens to one such bird that is put into this situation. He ends up leaving his comfortable nest in order to search for his mother. He goes in search of his mother and ends up asking a kitten, cow, dog, car, boat, and a plane if they are his mother. Luckily for him he is returned to his nest by a friendly Snort (dump truck) before his mother gets back.<br />The spirit of the little bird who goes looking for his mother is wonderfully expressed through the illustrations. They are simple, but expressive, cute, and colorful. The story flows well, and this makes for a cute, fun book.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-06-18

Their adventures take them all the way \\"Out the window. Down the tree. Over the wall. Under the bridge. Around the lake. Between the rocks. Up Spook Hill.\\" On Spook Hill they meet with a creature that sends them all clamoring back to their safe bed; an owl.<br />The pictures are done mostly in shades of blue, in order to make it look like nighttime. I think they do a wonderful job of conveying the mood- the lantern gives off yellow light and adds a neat effect.<br />The story is told in a very, very simple way. It is told entirely in short, three word sentences, which fit the sneaky mood of the bears perfectly. The lack of elaboration draws the eye to the drawings to look for explanation there. This works amazingly well, and makes for a fun, concise book.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-06-18

I think it is really cute how people don't even notice there is a seal walking down the street, or if they do they don't act like it is any thing out of the ordinary.<br />The pictures in the original 1959 version are very cute, full of expression and well colored. In the original the colors are shaded in, and almost look as if they were colored in by some very artistic kid with crayons.<br />The story flows wonderfully, even if some parts don't quite make sense. It is a very cute, if rather nonsensical, story.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-06-18

Finally she has had enough, and goes downstairs \\"where she had three minutes and forty-five seconds of peace before they all came to join her.\\"<br />Mrs. Large and her family are all elephants, which causes for some absolutely wonderful drawings. My favorite is probably when she is sitting in the bathtub, sipping tea, while wearing a yellow flowered shower cap. The pictures in general are really cute, colorful and expressive. The story is told in a very straightforward, endearing manner. In my opinion, this is a great book.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-06-18

The Frog Prince and his Princess aren't getting along too well. He can't seem to stop trying to catch flies on his tongue, or bouncing on the furniture. His Princess, well, in short the relationship just isn't working out. One day the Princess threw an awful fit, and the Frog Prince decides to get someone to turn him back into a frog. After several adventures in which only a good knowledge of fairy tales, long legs and patience keep him safe, he comes back to his castle after realizing the worth of his Princess, and the two go back to living happily ever after. This time however, things are slightly different.<br />The pictures in this book couldn't be called cute and cuddly, or even cheerful, unless the one doing the calling either doesn't know the meanings of the words or was being sarcastic.

The story flows wonderfully; it has to the way it was written.<br />The illustrations are also very good. They do an excellent job of capturing the emotions- the devilish smile on the possum's face, the frustration of the narrator, and the bewilderment of the rest of the family.<br />For all its many wonderful characteristics, the way this book reads is what makes it so special and unique.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-06-18

'Odd,' said Mabel. 'Very odd.'&quot;<br />My favorite line in this book is the often repeated &quot;'Odd,' said Mabel. 'Very odd.'&quot; The whole book is sweet, loveable, and remarkably funny. The idea of a duck that thinks it's a cat makes for a lot of fun.

During his ride he keeps managing to pick up passengers, some are hitchhiking, and some just jump out of trees on top of him. Each time he meets another bike on the road there is a collision, but our bear always lands on his feet (or on his unicycle) and rides off alone.<br />This is a really cute book. The bears all have expressive faces, and all the pictures are bold and colorful.

Often the comments made about the animals don't rhyme, but this doesn't impede the flow of words. The book still flows wonderfully.<br />I always am pleased to see how wonderfully the drawings are done. To come up with all those creatures and yet be able to have each of them look special and different is amazing.

In this book Danny takes the dinosaur with him to summer camp. Of course they have unusual adventures. This book tells about their first day at camp.<br />The story flows much better than either of the previous two Danny and the dinosaur books, but the story still lacks a certain charm and the plot still feels rather strained. Illustration wise both Danny and the dinosaur look a lot more like they did in the first book. All of the pictures are cute and I find it amazing how expressive a dinosaur's face can be. I do find however, that the way they chose to color in the pictures makes them look rather harsh.<br />The reason I give this book four stars and not five is that it is still missing some charm that I know this author can provide, because he did so with Sammy the Seal.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-05-22

A father bear brings home a brand-new bike for his son Small Bear, but before Small Bear is allowed to ride it, Father Bear has to show him how. \\"First come the lessons, then the fun. How to get on is lesson one.\\" Of course Father Bear promptly falls off the bike, and covers up by saying \\"That is what you should not do. So let that be a lesson to you.\\"<br />This lesson sets the pattern that the other six lessons follow. Each lesson ends with Father Bear in some sort of trouble, which Small Bear always manages to get him out of. Of course, when Father Bear actually lets Small Bear ride the bike, he does so perfectly.<br />I believe these characters are a primitive form of the now well-known Berenstain Bears. Father Bear and Mother Bear are certainly wearing their outfits, and the tree house looks pretty much the same. The pictures themselves are very cute, bold and colorful. (Mama Bear's expressions are great.) The words flow well and rhyme, which adds a certain charm to the book. In short, I think it is a great book.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-05-22

The lack of plot is not something that harms the book in my eyes, I like the chance encounters with the strange creatures, and I think the lack of a plot helps to make this story special.<br />Throughout this book we are introduced to a number of cute creatures from fish to Wumps to Zeds. Like all Dr. Seuss creations they are very cute, bold, colorful and expressive.

It starts one day when Danny decides to go to the museum where he meets a live dinosaur. Danny and the dinosaur then leave the museum and go exploring around town and have many adventures before it is time for the dinosaur to return to the museum. The second story, Happy Birthday Danny and the Dinosaur!, is 32 pages long. In it Danny goes back to the museum to invite the dinosaur to his birthday party. The dinosaur is glad to accept, and, as it turns out, today is his birthday too! The third story, Danny and the Dinosaur Go To Camp, is also 32 pages long. In this story Danny takes the dinosaur with him to summer camp. Of course they have unusual adventures. This story tells about their first day at camp.<br />All of the stories have some wording trouble. In places the wording is awkward and some of the conversations are hardly believable. Each story however improves on the previous one in this sense however, and the last one flows reasonably well.<br />The drawings change slightly from story to story. The dinosaurs in the first and last stories are slightly different from each other and definitely different from the ones in the middle, even though it is all supposed to be the same dinosaur. The colors certainly make the drawings stand out, but to me they also make it look harsh. I my prefer the style of coloring that was done in the original 1958 version of Danny and the Dinosaur. Other than that the illustrations are great.<br />In short, this is a fun collection of three good stories about a boy with his friend dinosaur.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-05-22

One day Pablo decides that he has had enough of this cold weather. \\"It is silly to be chilly. I will go where I can be warm all the time.\\" Pablo decides to try skiing farther north, but the stove strapped to his back causes more problems than Pablo expects. His next attempt to leave also fails, but by the third time he has come up with a reasonably good plan: he turns the ice his igloo sits on into a boat and sails away. This causes problems later, but he still manages to find a nice warm island home where he lives happily ever after.<br />The story flows nicely and has no awkward spots. The pictures are wonderful. I never realized just how expressive a penguin's face could be until I saw this book. The pictures are bright, colorful, bold, and simple. The whole book is a lot of fun.

Danny and the dinosaur have changed slightly, and the pictures don't have quite the same style as in the first book. The pictures are cute, even if the solid colors they are filled in with make them look kind of harsh.<br />The reasons I give this book four stars are the words are still a bit awkward, the plot is rather strained (pointless escapades added to lengthen the plot and nothing really happens), and finally because the book  in general lacks a charm that other books contain in abundance.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-05-22

Danny and the dinosaur then leave the museum and go exploring around town and have many adventures before it is time for the dinosaur to return to the museum.<br />The reason I only gave this book four stars is that I find the wording rather strained and awkward. Even though the words are not great, the illustrations are fun. Depending on the version, the illustrations are colored differently. The original (copyright 1958) has better colors in my opinion. They are a mix of pictures in shades of brown and pictures in full color. The main difference between the color quality in the original and reissue is that the reissue has a solid color, and the original almost look as if it were colored in lightly with crayons. I think the color in the reissue is harsher, and therefore prefer the previous. The drawing themselves are wonderful, cute and expressive.<br />So in my opinion this is a four star book because of the occasional awkwardness with the words and because of the way the pictures are colored in.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-05-22

Not only do we learn what noises cows, sheep, and singing pigs make, it covers normal pigs, rhinos, little and pig dogs, cats and kittens, ducks, horses, and you. (Yes, I'm talking about you!)<br />My absolute favorite part is the singing pigs. `Three singing pigs say LA LA LA! \\"No, no!\\" you say, \\"that isn't right. The pigs say oink all day and night.\\"' The pictures are just as wonderful as the words. For the singing pigs, we see three pigs all dressed up in a chorus line, but for the normal pigs they are on all four feet without the clothes looking slightly gloomy because they aren't supposed to be singing. All the animals are cute, bright bold and colorful. This is another great book by Boynton.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-01-01

Someone keeps stealing peanuts from the storeroom. The only opening besides the locked door is a small crack in the wall. To solve this mystery Mickey calls in Detective Donald. When Donald arrives, he first denies all offers of help, given by Mickey and Chip and Dale, two chipmunks. He then tries to figure out who is stealing the peanuts by having each animal try to get at them through the crack, but none of the animals can reach them. His next brilliant idea is to rig a trap so that the thief will have to step in blue paint and will set off a bell when he tries to steal the peanuts. During the night, the bell goes off, he wakes up, and he sees eight footprints in the paint. He then rushes off to visit the octopus, and is disappointed to find out that octopuses don't like peanuts. Mickey then suggests that the prints may have been made by two four-footed animals, and Donald rushes off. This time he gets it right; the thieves are Chip and Dale. They had been taking peanuts and storing them up for winter in their burrow. Now they work for Mickey sweeping the park, and get all the peanuts they can eat.<br />The book has cute bright pictures. I am really fond of Donald's classic detective outfit, complete with bag. The story is told in a very straightforward manner, and flows nicely. I think it is adorable the way Donald keeps rushing off on a new way to find the thief when the chipmunks keep offering to help him.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-01-01

As its name suggests, this book talks about opposites \\"Big and small, short and tall.\\" The major downside in this book is the words. They still flow nicely and rhyme without strain, but they lack some little charm that almost all of the other Boynton books have. Another reason for this is that it is a list of opposites illustrated and carefully placed so they rhyme. The pictures and placement of the words make up for the actual words however. My favorite picture is for the in/out, two turtles, one in its shell, and one standing on top of it. Every page has a cute picture. Also, the way the words are written, not the words themselves, is a wonderful thing. The big is written big, the small small, the tall vertical, and in the slow each letter is separated.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2004-01-01

Duke was overjoyed to be out of the pet store, or at least he was until Sammy called the neighbor hood dogs over and they started digging. Since Duke had spent all of his life on a stone floor, he couldn't dig, and when the dogs disowned him felt as if he had let both himself and Sammy down. The next day Duke tried again, and he managed to dig! He was so excited that he started digging, and digging, and digging. \\"[He] dug up the fence. [He] dug up the gates. [He] dug up the garden of Mrs. Thwaites.\\" Duke only stopped digging when he found Sammy looking down on him. Sammy wasn't pleased, and told Duke that he was going back to the pet store. To escape Sammy and the other dogs (who had come with Sammy) Duke dug straight down, creating a well, from which the dogs helped to rescue him. As soon as he was out of the well, he ran back and fixed the mess he made in the town. Now Duke still lives with Sammy, and he does the plowing.<br />One really neat thing about this book is how the pictures express the mood of the page. The pet-store is a boring brownish color and Sammy's place is bright and cheerful, except when the dogs disown Duke-then it is all slightly bluish. Duke's face is also really expressive. The story is told in rhyme, and flows well. It is also told from Duke's perspective. If possible, I would give this book four and a half stars because while the story is cute, the book just seems to lack a charm that some other books have in abundance.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-12-31

Would you rather be a dog... or a cat? It's time for you to think about important things like that.\\" This is how the wonderful book Would you Rather be a Bullfrog starts off. Throughout the book the reader is questioned on what they would rather be, and a cat and dog is just the beginning. By the time you've finished reading the book you've been asked if `you'd rather have a feather or a bushy tail behind', whether you'd rather be a minnow or a whale, a hammer or a nail.<br />This story is told in rhyme, the standard for all Dr. Seuss books. The pictures are all bright and colorful, and the book is quite straightforward; it comes right out and asks you things, no beating around the bush for it! I think this is a wonderful book in part because it can be so much fun imagining which out of the options provided you'd rather be. Another thing that makes it a wonderful book is the special charm all Dr. Seuss books have.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-12-03

He picks out the one he wants and names him Otto. Mr. Carp, the pet storeowner, tells the boy how to feed Otto. \\"Never feed him a lot. Never more than a spot! Or something may happen. You never know what.\\"<br />When the little boy gets home, he feeds Otto just a spot, but Otto isn't happy. He wants more food. Our hero remembers what Mr. Carp told him, but disobeys and feeds Otto the whole box of fish food.<br />Then something happens, just like Mr. Carp said. Otto begins to grow. He grows and grows, until he is too big for the bathtub. The little boy calls the police, who tow poor Otto to the pool, but soon Otto is too big for that too. Mr. Carp gets called, and shrinks Otto back to his normal size, and says to the boy \\"And from now on, PLEASE don't feed him too much. Just so much, and no more!\\"<br />The pictures in this book are bright, colorful and expressive. The story teaches the importance of following directions in a way that isn't too obvious or preachy. The reason I give this book 4 stars instead of five stars is that the writing doesn't flow overly well. The way the writing is arranged looks as if it should rhyme, and some of it does, but for the most part it doesn't. Other than that I like the book.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-11-08

The BEAR DETECTIVES will find it again!\\" But before they can get to work finding the pumpkin, Father Bear (and his old dog Snuff) appear wanting to help. Father Bear and Snuff then rush off along the road with very little clue of where they are going<br />Father Bear and Snuff lead the Bear Detectives all over. Before turning the case over to the Bear Detectives, they manage to check out a \\"cow, brown and white. Checked out a scarecrow after a fight.\\" \\"Checked out a haystack. Three pigs in a pen...put the [hand] cuffs on Farmer Ben's hen.\\"<br />Of course, as soon as Father Bear turns over the case, the Bear Detectives manage to find the thief, who really wasn't a thief, right away. As it turns out, Mrs. Ben had 'stolen' the pumpkin to make pumpkin pies, and everyone (including the chicken handcuffed to Father Bear) got a pie to eat.<br />This book flows nicely, and is told in rhyme. The pictures add a lot to the book. They exaggerate on the misfortunes of poor Father Bear as he searches for the pie. They also are bright, colorful and funny. The story is very cute.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-11-08

Many of them aren't very good, like the joke that goes: \\"When do elephants have sixteen feet?

Besides Goofy, there is Jiminy Cricket, Prince John, Dumbo, Pinocchio, Mickey and more of our friends are in here. The book is arranged so that almost each page has a riddle, and the answer to the previous riddle with a picture to match.

The story all starts off with some flies and a giant. While the rest of the town is worrying about some giant, Mickey is busy sewing in his little tailor shop. He isn't worried about the giant, just annoyed by all the flies that are buzzing around his shop. So Mickey gets out his flyswatter and kills 7 flies in one blow. He is so proud of this achievement he cried out to two farmers on the street `I killed seven with one blow!' As the farmers were talking about the giant, they assumed Mickey had killed seven giants with one blow.<br />Through word of mouth news of this feat makes it all the way to the King, who seds for the tailor. First he asks how Mickey killed seven with one blow. After Mickey does a dramatic recital, the Kin g tells him, \\"Little tailor, if you will be my giant killer you may marry the princess.\\" At this piece of news, Mickey gladly becomes the King's giant killer, even though he had no clue how to go about killing giants.<br />So Mickey goes out into the country and who else should happen to appear but the giant. After a daring fight on Mickey's part (that was more dodging the giants strikes) Mickey manages to get the giant all wrapped up in thread so that \\"he could not move. He could not even stand up. The giant fell down with a great crash!\\" This crash naturally brought all of the townspeople to the field, and Mickey got lauded as a great hero, as well as getting to marry Princess Minnie.<br />The pictures are bright, bold, colorful, cute, etc. Some of the best ones are when Mickey is brandishing his scissors to show to the King how he killed the flies. An interesting comment on the pictures is that while Mickey and Minnie are mice, all others in the story (all the townspeople, king, courtiers, etc.) are all people. Even the giant looks like a really big, normal person. I really like this story because of the cute pictures and the cute story line. The story itself is told in a simple straightforward way, as you might be able to tell from the quotes I included.<br />Loggie-log-log-logline.

He tries to point this out to his teacher, who tells him \\"Nothing is wacky here in my class! Get out! You're the wacky one!

Patrolman McGann quickly assures us that \\"Wacky Wednesday will soon go away!\\" \\"Only twenty things more will be wacky,\\" he said. \\"Just find them and then you can go back to bed.\\"<br /> The pictures are really cute, bold, and colorful, not to mention the fact that it is fun to try and spot all the things wrong in the pictures. Some are reasonably hard to find, even for me. Every page except for the last has something wrong. Some of them are obvious, but others are not. The story itself is told very well and in rhyme. In short, the plot may not be that great, but because of what it is it doesn't have to be. The pictures compliment the words nicely, creating a very good book.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-11-07

Every morning when Marco leaves home to walk to school, 'Dad always says to me, \\"Marco, keep your eyelids up and see what you can see.\\"'  We meet Marco when he is on the way back from school and all he's noticed 'was a horse and a wagon on Mulberry Street.' Marco isn't too proud of this observation, \\"That can't be my story. That's only a start. I'll say that a ZEBRA was pulling that cart!\\"<br />Slowly and surely the story changes, now the zebra is pulling a chariot, now it's a reindeer, next it's pulling a sled and before you know it, he's got two giraffes and an elephant pulling a big brass band with a trailer attached on behind going through town escorted by the police. Marco gets so excited about this 'story that no one could beat! And to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street!' But when Dad asks him what he sees he replies '\\"Nothing\\" I said, growing red as a beat, \\"but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry street.\\"'<br />The story is told in rhyme, as you might be able to see from some of the quotes I used. The story flows wonderfully, just like all of Dr. Seuss' works. The pictures are wonderful as well. The way all the animals are smiling and seem pleased that they get to pull these things is just really cute. The colors used are really nice, and the pictures are really bold and bright.<br />Personally, this is one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books because I really like Marco's imagination and how he is always telling 'such outlandish tales... turning minnows into whales'.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-11-05

The plot itself isn't too weird, but the manner of presentation is, well, strange. The book starts off with the discovery made by Mrs. Cats that her son Chester is missing. \\"Where can my Chester be? I miss him. Lolly and Polly miss him. Dicky and Ricky miss him. Terry, Merry and Melvin miss him. The house is empty without him!\\" (Considering the size of the house, it would always seem empty unless a big herd of elephants moved in.)<br />As it gets later in the day and Chester still has not put in an appearance, Mrs. Cats call the police, who send Sam Sunday the detective. This is where the story really starts to get strange. It almost seems like a weak attempt a humor, which, at least for me, fails completely. When Sam gets to Mrs. Cats house, he starts to question her about her son. As soon as he has a teeny bit of info about when he disappeared and what he likes, he says \\"Enough! I will find your son or my name is not Sam Sunday!\\"  He then jumps in his car (which is really neat looking by the way) and drives off to a series of different places based on the small amount of info about Chester's hobbies.<br />First Sam visits the zoo, then the library, then a gypsy camp, and then finds him in the aquarium. At the zoo he asks if they have any cats. The zookeeper says they have lots of cats. Then Sam says he's looking for one with an earring, and the zookeeper tells him to try another zoo. Next he goes to the library, where he asks the librarian if she has seen a cat that loves books with \\"Gray coat. Yellow eyes. Gold earring in one ear.\\" The librarian says, \\"I have not seen your gypsy cat.\\" so Sam goes looking for Chester in a gypsy camp. When he gets to the gypsy camp, he sees a cat with a gray coat, yellow eyes and a gold earring. He grabs the cat, but then a gypsy lady yells at him because that cat is not Chester. While Chester's earring is in his left ear, this cat has their earring in his right ear. \\"That's a fact, ma'am.\\" is Sam's response. Then the gypsy looks into her crystal ball and says that Chester is near water and fish. Sam then rushes off to the aquarium, where he finds Chester. After a short discussion, Chester gets in Sam's car and is taken back to his mother, Lolly, Polly, Dicky, Ricky, Terry, Merry and Melvin.<br />Not only is the story told in a singularly weird manner, the pictures are strange as well. All of the cats that have speaking lines and all the cats in the cats in the gypsy's camp all walk on two legs. The only cats that don't do this are Lolly, Polly, Dicky, Ricky, Terry, Merry and Melvin. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be pet cats, or what. Why would a cat be keeping pet cats? But on the other hand, why is there some distinction between Chester and what I would otherwise assume to be his brothers and sisters? Other than that, the pictures are well drawn, even if the choice of colors is slightly different from what I would of picked. One point perspective is used very well and to good effect in this book.<br />In short, my first sentence pretty much sums up all I feel for the book.

The two of them (Savi and her mother) spend the whole day at the beach, splashing in the water, eating bananas from the near-by banana tree, resting on the sand, and playing with Savi's sailboat. When the sun starts to set, Savi's mother says to Savi, \\"Now it's time to go home.\\" Savi, like all little kids, doesn't listen and continues to play while her mother gets more and more annoyed. Finally Mother walks away into the shadows of the banana trees. At first Savi doesn't care, but then she begins to feel cold and hungry. That's when she sees the first banana. When she picks that one up, she sees another, then another. Savi follows this trail until she finds her mother waiting for her, and then runs to meet her mother. When Savi looks up she one last banana that she can't reach. When she asks her mother to pick it for her, her mother replies, \\"That banana is the moon. It will help us to see our way home.\\"<br />The thing that makes this book so special is the pictures. Each picture looks like a picture of a quilt or embroidery block. The stitching is beautiful. Most of it seems to be flat, but there is the occasional thing that isn't just to emphasize it. The bananas looked like they are made of plastic for example, and many of the leaves on the banana trees look as if they stand out. The pictures are very well done. The reason I don't give this book five stars is that I'm not overly fond of the story line.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-11-01

In this version of the story the house that belongs to the Blairs (humans) has been broken into by a bear named Somebody instead of having the house of the three bears being broken into by Goldilocks. The story follows the regular pattern we have come to know with this tale, with a few additions. Somebody eats breakfast, sits in the chairs, and then goes looking for toys. Next he goes looking for something to drink, before finding a bed to sleep in.<br />Unlike in many other versions of this story, the baby seems very pleased with the visitor. He smiles when he sees some of the messes made by the bear, and seems very pleased to find a `big teddy bear' asleep in his bed.  While Mr. and Mrs. Blair are trying to figure out what to do, Somebody escapes down the drainpipe, and leaves the house with baby calling after \\"Bye- bye.

The song is about how on their day off, all the teddy bears that ever there was will gather there (in the woods) for certain, because today's the day the Teddy Bears have their picnic. The song then goes on to describe what happens at the picnic. The song is very cute, and has a very catchy tune, which cannot (unfortunately) be heard because this is a book. The illustrations are absolutely beautiful, and are what makes this book worthwhile. The bears look very cute, cuddly and realistic. The book itself is smaller than a normal book; perhaps that is what the `miniature' in the title means. It is only 0.25 x 5.25 x 4.00, while most picture books are bigger.<br />In my opinion the best way to read this book is with the tune playing, either out loud, or in your head. I think hearing the tune while reading this book adds a certain something that makes the book good. If it weren't for the song, I probably would only give this book four stars. If you haven't heard the song, there are several websites that play it.<br />Loggie log log log	2003-10-05

In Illinois, for example, it is against the law to speak English. Some of the laws make you wonder what was going on that this had to be made into a law. Some of these laws made me laugh out-loud, both at the law itself, and at the thought of trying to enforce them now. Many of them are odd, weird, and, well, crazy.<br />The book is organized by the subject of the laws. All laws about tightrope walkers are under the heading `Tightrope Walking.' All laws about keeping alligators are under `Alligators.' All these titles are organized in alphabetical order. In some cases this makes it difficult for one to find a law about a particular subject because you have to guess what title they are going to use for it.<br />Scattered throughout this books pages are funny cartoon pictures in black-and-white.

He can't fit on the swings, or on the roundabout, and is too fat for the slide. Then he finds a soccer ball. (Note: the book says football but means soccer ball. This book was written in UK where a soccer ball is called a football.) When a little girl comes up to ask if she can have the ball back, Humphrey asks if he can play. The girl agrees, and Humphrey gets to guard the goal.<br />After a full afternoon of playing soccer with the kids, giving piggy-back rides, and rolling in the mud Humphrey comments to bird that \\"I feel much fitter now, Bird\\" Bird, being the practical one, replies, \\"You look it, Humphrey. And you'll look even better when you've had a bath.\\"<br />Like the other three in this series, this book is told in a straightforward manner that I really enjoy. The pictures are bold, colorful, bright, and playful. It is a wonderful book.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-08-19

Luckily for him he had his own special talent, a talent for painting and creating.<br />When Little Gopher went out into the hills to think about becoming a man, he had a dream vision. This vision told him to find a white buckskin and to `keep it and one day you will paint a picture that is as pure as the colors in the evening sky.'<br />Little Gopher got the white buckskin soon after, but didn't have the right paints to paint the sunset. He kept trying to achieve the right colors. Every morning he mixed paints in hopes that these ones wouldn't be dull and flat like the others, but to no avail.<br />One night a voice told him to go up on top of a hill next evening at sunset, `Because you have been faithful to the People and to your true gift, you shall find the colors you are seeking.' Little Gopher went to the hill the next evening and, lo and behold, there are brushes full of paint the color of the sunset waiting there for him to paint his masterpiece.<br />Little Gopher painted his masterpiece and when he got done he walked back to his tent, leaving the brushes strewn across the hillside. In the morning the brushes had multiplied and turned into flowers, and little Gopher became known as He-Who-Brought-the-Sunset-to-the-Earth.<br />This book carries several good messages about being true to yourself and not giving up in the face of adversity.  It is also a wonderful retelling of a Native American Legend. He book flows wonderfully and the pictures are bright and colorful.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-08-10

Megan and the dragon have horrible luck because they continuously have to change vehicles. First the wagon does not go very far... so they hop into a car. After the car they get on a bus, then a boat, then a sled, next a truck, a train, a plane, parachutes, and a hot air balloon. As they change vehicles they slowly meet more people/animals who accompany them throughout the book. For example: on the bus they meet a horse and a fat hippopotamus. Note: on the very last page of the book are pictures of all the different vehicles Megan rode on with the corresponding word and a title `You can read these words with Megan.'<br />This story is told in a neat way. Except in one place, every other sentence rhymes. Excepting that one place, the story flows very smoothly. The pictures are bold and colorful, even if the animals are not drawn to size (the horse is bigger than the hippo). I especially like the way the plane has a face.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-08-02

In her search she tries all sorts of animals. First she finds a bug, but it isn't cuddly. Then in order she finds a mouse, bird, frog, snake, fish, dog, and turtle. Each one has some problem, some reason why it won't make the perfect pet.  The mouse is too small; the bird is too busy, etc. So Emma gets sad. Then she suddenly sees `the biggest, softest, cuddliest thing she had ever seen. (turn page) It was her father.' She then asks him if he will be her pet, and he asks if she will be his. `And she hugged her new big soft cuddly pet. And it hugged her right back.'<br />This book is very sweet, and has beautiful illustrations. I really like it.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-07-28

In this version everyone is a penguin. Other than that this story follows the normal Cinderella story. Cinderella is treated cruelly by her stepmother and stepsisters. Family gets invitation to ball.  Stepmother and sisters go leaving Cinderella crying. Fairy comes and gets Cinderella ready and brings her to the ball. Prince falls in love. Cinderella flees at midnight. Prince goes searching and finds her. They live happily ever after.<br />What makes this story unique is mainly the use of penguins and the cute, bold, colorful illustrations. The Fairy in this story is called the Fairy Penguin and is a small penguin with wings. The mice that get turned into horses look like penguins with whiskers and Mickey Mouse ears. The horses look like penguins that have sprouted an extra pair of flippers and walk on all of them. The strange thing is that it looks so right. I didn't mind seeing the penguins wearing clothes. In fact I was amused at seeing Cinderella helping her stepsister into a corset. In short, I really liked this book. If your interested, there are more books by this author using penguins.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-07-26

Two scoundrels come into town saying they can make cloth that can't be seen by the dishonest and simpleminded when they really can't do anything of the sort. They trick the emperor into buying a suit of clothes of this imaginary cloth. Emperor wears the suit in a parade and gets heartily embarrassed when it is pointed out that he has nothing on.<br />What makes this story unique is the use of penguins and the wonderful illustrations that are also bold and colorful. I never get tiered of seeing all the neat clothes that the penguins wear, from capes with fringe to billowing skirts, to sailor boy costumes, to clown suits. Also seeing penguins with hair and moustaches is really very cute. This author also wrote another book using the penguin idea.

The story starts out on a slightly unusual day for Kayl, who is currently working as an innkeeper with her two father-less children. Kayl is sweeping the front steps when a grand visitor appears, which doesn't often happen in this small town. This mysterious lady fascinates Kayl, especially when she realizes that the lady is from the Sisterhood of Stars. The Sisterhood of Stars is a group of sorceresses that are very powerful, and are respected throughout the Eastern Alliance.<br />Kayl herself was a member of the Sisterhood of Stars until she got so mad at the politics that she left. Before she left was part of a group that preformed a dangerous mission to find out what was stored in the Twisted Tower. Only half of the group survived. This member of the Sisterhood of Stars is asking her to go back.<br />At the same time a friend of her husband (both husband and friend went to the Twisted Tower and survived) is telling her that terrible things will happen if she goes back. This friend is a Wizard and he can see the future, but he is not an average seer. This `gift' is more like a curse to him, and has been happening ever since his trip to the Twisted Tower.<br />This is the story of Kayl's choice, and the repercussions of that choice. It tells how Kayl realizes that she must face her past and can't just hope it will go away. This book was told in a wonderful style that is characteristic of Patricia C. Wrede's work. It certainly kept me interested.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-07-25

These robbers (like all robbers) robbed people for a living. This particular set of robbers robbed carriages.<br />One night the robbers make a mistake. Instead of stopping a carriage full of rich people with money or rich jewelry, they `stopped a carriage that had but one passenger, an orphan named Tiffany.' Well Tiffany was delighted, and since the robbers didn't know what else to do they took her home to their hide-out where she promptly turned their world upside down by asking them what they planned to do with their wealth.<br />Realizing that they were doing nothing with their horded wealth, and that this was really a waste, they decide to buy a castle and bring to it all the `lost, unhappy, and abandoned children they could find.' These children grow up and marry, but as a testament to their benefactors build three towers.<br />I realize that this summary doesn't make this book sound all that great, but I like it. Also this summary seems to completely conflict with the editorial review. The editorial review is not really one for this book. If you look closely it is really a review for `Crictor; Moon Man'. It only gives a passing mention to `The Three Robbers' at the very bottom. The illustrations are bold and more often than not the page is black and the writing white. The story is told in a style that endears the book to me.<br />Loggie-log-log-log	2003-07-25

They are light, funny, and have interesting plot twists. Like The Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Volume 1 and 2, this book contains stories about the castle in which the mighty sorcerer Chrestomanci lives. This books contains four short stories; Warlock at the Wheel, Stealer of Souls, Carol Oneir's Hundredth Dream, and The Sage of Theare. If you haven't already read the Chronicles of Chrestomanci I would suggest that you do that before reading this book because the stories go in chronological order.<br />Warlock at the Wheel is a story about a warlock. This is the shortest story in the book. For a reason not disclosed on the book, Chrestomanci has taken away his magic and he is \\"forced\\" to take to a life of crime. Unfortunately he is not very good at this and ends up getting the police after him. To escape the police he turns to a French wizard and sends him into an alternate world where he still has magic. This is the story of how he makes his life in this world. Chrestomanci himself doesn't actually show up in this story, but his man does and Chrestomanci is mentioned many a time.<br />Stealer of Souls is the longest, and in my opinion, the best of the four. It brings back Cat whom we met in Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Volume 2. This story is about an evil magician called Master Spiderman. Master Spiderman is trying to steal the lives from all past and future Chrestomanci so that he can become more powerful than the current Chrestomanci. Chrestomanci himself plays a role in this story, but it is a small role.<br />Carol Oneir's Hundredth Dream is about a girl named Carol Oneir. Carol is a girl who can control what she dreams about, and those dreams can them be saved for others to dream. This is a big business, and has made Carol and her family quite rich. Because of this Carol is quite snooty and looks down on other children. In this story Carol lays down to have her hundredth dream, and nothing happens. Her mom instantly rushes her off to see all kinds of specialists. No one can figure out the problem until her dad asks Chrestomanci to take a look. Chrestomanci is, of course, able to find out what is wrong. This is the story of what went wrong with Carol's dream and of how she learns (in a small way) to be a better person.<br />The last story in this book is called The Sage of Theare. This story is about the city of Theare with all of its neat orderly gods, and the prophecy that states, \\"It is written that a Sage shall be born who shall question everything. His questions shall bring down the exquisite order of Heaven and cast all the gods into disorder.\\" This is the story of how the gods try to prevent the prophecy from happening and the resulting conflict.<br />All in all I gave this book four stars because of its wonderful style of writing and original plots.  In my mind it doesn't deserve five stars because in most of the book it lacks a certain something that may or may not be charm.<br />Loggie-log-log-logdredth dream, and nothing happens.

Deanna has been brought along by her mother to spend the summer in France with relatives. She is not having a good time. Her mother can speak many languages, and tells Deanna that she will pick French up during the stay. Deanna doesn't and has to use gestures to talk with her relatives who only speak French.<br />One day when Deanna is out walking with only a cat named Oliver for company, she stumbles upon a well. Thinking it looks so much like a wishing well, she started to wish. The only problem is she doesn't know quite what she wants to wish for. Her thoughts fly instantly to the wish of her father and mother living together happily again, without a divorce. She gets no farther than \\"I wish...\\" when Oliver accidentally causes her to drop her Mickey Mouse watch into the well. Suddenly she finds herself being pulled into the well, for it really is a magic well and the wishing has caused a loop-hole in time through which her watch fell. `the Fair Folk' who tell her that she must get the watch back in 24 hours, or else it will destroy history pulled her into the well. If she doesn't complete this task she will cease to exist.<br />Oliver leaped into the well after seeing Deanna disappear into it. Because of Deanna's questions, the Fair Folk decide that Oliver is much smarter than Deanna and that she will need help on this quest. Then they turn Oliver into a human, and set the two off on their quest.<br />The reason I rated this book four stars and not five is that Deanna's attitude got on my nerves. She always assumed that she was right; that she knew exactly what was going on even when all evidence pointed in the opposite direction.	2003-07-23

Humphrey is a ghost. Humphrey is a bit of a disappointment to his mother and father. He doesn't moan or wail, his ectoplasm is pinkish, and he can't even disappear properly. Humphrey's mother is a hag, and Humphrey's father is a Scottish ghost with a sword sticking out of his chest. Humphrey's brother is a screaming scull, and his sister constantly moans because she can't reach her bowl of water to clean off her bloodstains. Yes, Humphrey's parents are worried about him.<br />One day Aunt Hortensia came to live with the family. She has been forced out of the place she was haunting, and decided to come live in the old castle that Humphrey's family haunts. She brought with her stories of lots of ghosts being forced out of their old haunts or of being forced to haunt places like butcher shops (oh horror!). The family was staunch in their belief that whatever happened out in the rest of the world, they would be safe here.<br />However the unthinkable happened. Developers came to their castle and started to turn it into an amusement place. The family leaves, seeking a new place. They spend the night in a boardinghouse. At the boardinghouse they meet a boy named Rick. Rick is already mad at the injustices people are doing to animals, and is shocked to see that ghosts share the threat of extinction. He wants to help the ghosts and decides that they need to create a Ghost Sanctuary.<br /><br />This is the story of Rick going to the Prime Minister and asking for a ghost sanctuary. It is also, more importantly, about how Humphrey realizes that he doesn't have to be Horrible, he is fine the way he is.<br />The story is written in that creative style that always characterizes Ibbotson's work.

And then, as they are riding home into the sunset, Humphrey asks `Can I have a tractor for my next birthday?' `We'll see,' said Bird<br />This book has wonderful pictures that are very humorous.
