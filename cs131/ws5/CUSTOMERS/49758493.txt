One night,the killer murders a woman and her teen daughter. The husband/father is a wealthy Dr. who decides to pursue the killer after the cops basically give up..... <BR>Lots of graphic unpleasantness here,as most Playboy Press titles were,although this is fairly well written,unlike most of that defunct publishers catalog.

Well,the ending turns out a little different(and maybe that's the surprise for those who remember the Eastwood movie),but the dialogue here is great. Bendis is  a lot stronger as a writer than an artist,and it shows in this volume. I really liked the 4 page spoof of Jinx as &quot;The Incredible Jinx&quot;,mocking the Hulk's short lived female counterpart. Bendis even has a page spoofing the Hostess ads found in mid-late 70s Marvel comics! Bendis reminds me of Frank Miller a bit; Both writers/artists who are better with stories than as competition for Frank Frazetta,and both with a noir fascination. Jinx is worth a look.....	2002-07-04

Yes! Graysmith gives us a very detailed index,which is always a plus with a case of this magnitude,and numerous photos of \\"Starr\\"/Allen(The main Zodiac suspect today),Detective Toschi(Frequently mentioned in Graysmiths first Zodiac book,and who allegedly received a letter from Zodiac in 1978),Melvin Belli(Who also received communications from Zodiac)and some rare pix of crime scenes in the case. Also,kudos for the chapters on the N.Y.Zodiac,who,if you'll remember,was only caught through a fluke on the part of N.Y.P.D.,who had a cop investigating another crime/crisis scene who recognized the suspects handwriting to that of Z. While this book could have been more complete(Why no mention of the Doreen Gaul/James Sharp murders in 1969? The killer in that case left a Zodiac note,even if it was probably  a copycat),still,it's an excellent look at a puzzling case,which could still be solved(Note the recent arrest in the Green River case).....	2002-04-10

You can expect this excellent book by the author of the famous,out of print &quot;THE MANSON FILE'',to be as in demand in fifteen years  as ''FILE'' is now. Schreck gives a thorough, intelligent look at the subject, going all the way back to the silent, Faustian epic &quot;THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE&quot;(1913)to Polanski's latest,&quot;THE NINTH GATE&quot;(1999). More film writers should take a lesson or two from Schreck. I would place this fine book right up there with Carlos Clarens classic horror film study and Phil Hardys exhaustive tome on the subject.......It's good to have Schreck writing again!	2001-09-30
