He also gives a short course in hormones, which are strongly involved in aging.<br />Sears explains his anti-aging pyramid, which consists of meditation, moderate exercise and his Zone diet. Unlike the US Department of Agriculture food pyramid, which put bread, grains and starches at the bottom, to be eaten in big amounts, Sears' pyramid puts these at the top, to be eaten very sparingly, to reduce insulin secretion.<br />Insulin is so important to his Zone diet that he devotes an entire chapter to its effects on the body. He also devotes a chapter to cortisol, a hormone important in stress reactions. Plus, he has a chapter about eicosanoids, which are hormones that are very important in coordinating important body functions.<br />Insulin strongly affects the output and mix of eicosanoids. Since maintaining the correct amount of insulin in one's body is fundamental to his Zone diet, Sears gives a list of 14 different signs that one has the right amount and kind of eicosanoids active in one's body. <br />These signs consist of such varied things as hair strength and texture, appetite for carbohydrates, length of time of appetite suppression between meals, sleeping time and grogginess on awakening.<br />If all of these 14 different signs have the right status, it's an indication that one has had the right amount of insulin in one's body recently. <br />Sears ranges widely enough to get into trouble. For example, he recommends Coleus forskohli as an anti-cancer agent. Actually, it's catnip for some kinds of cancer.	2001-06-28

They buried the details beneath a petrified forest of lies.<br />Often, the murder victims themselves did not know that they were being murdered. They just knew that they were cold, tired, sick and starving. Then they died.<br />Little toads from the west, among them New York Times correspondent Walter Duranty, French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw and many others, hopped through the petrified forest and said it was a paradise.<br />Meanwhile, Lenin and, after him, Stalin gradually bled Russia nearly to death. It was a butcher bill so horrific that today, if the victims of Communist Party of the Soviet Union had lived to have children, there would be 300 million Russians alive. Instead, there are 150 million.<br />Following his arrest in 1945, Alexander Solzhenitsyn gradually became the chief excavator of truth about this butchery. <br />His \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,\\" which describes a day in the life of one of Stalin's prisoners, sped the collapse of the Soviet Union. His \\"Gulag Archipelago,\\" which describes the Soviet Communist Party's vast network of death camps, left Stalin's western colleagues and admirers nowhere to hide.<br />In his finely crafted biography, \\"Alexander Solzhenitsyn: A Century in His Life,\\" D.M Thomas, the English poet and novelist, unveils the personality and work habits which made it possible for Solzhenitsyn to write  his story.	2001-05-30

For an average man, four Zone blocks of protein, four of fat and four of carbohydrate add up to a wholesome dinner.<br />Suppose that your problem is, how much roasted goat meat adds up to four blocks of protein? If so, this is just the right book for you to own. <br />Simply go to the section on proteins. There are hundreds of different protein sources listed there, alphabetically, from `abalone' to `yogurt,' but you want to know about goat meat. The entry for `goat' says that one block of roasted goat meat weighs 0.9 ounces. To get the weight of four Zone blocks of goat meat, in case you're cooking for a hearty man's appetite, just multiply 0.9 ounces times 4. That's 3.6.<br />What happens next depends on how sunny your disposition is and how well your kitchen is equipped with measuring equipment. You can round things to the nearest ounce, 4.0 ounces, and make do with not much of a scale or you can get a sensitive chemist's balance and weigh thing to the nearest 10th of an ounce.<br />Simple, yes?<br />That's all there is to it, for thousands of sources of proteins, fats and carbohydrates listed in this book. It's a godsend if you're following a Zone diet, whether you're trying to decide on a haunch of roasted goat meat or a Whopper Junior.	2001-05-01

The key to this is to calculate one's lean body mass, and then eat just enough protein to maintain that amount of lean body mass. Then, one adjusts the amount of carbohydrate in one's diet so that there is roughly a 4 to 3 ratio of carbohydrate to protein. Finally, one adds enough fat to make up about 30 percent of all food calories. That's all there is to it.<br />This book explains the medical reasons for the Zone diet. It also tells you how to calculate your lean body mass, whether you're a man or a woman. And it gives more than 200 pages of recipes for meals which follow the Zone diet. There's good advice about food shopping and eating out, too. Also there are six pages of medical references in support of the Zone diet, as well as a useful index.	2001-05-01

Others won't.<br />The recipes in this book are sized accurately. They are measured both in terms of the number of servings and the number of blocks of protein, fat and carbohydrate. Each recipe is designed to have an equal number of blocks of fat, carbohydrate and protein, and the number of blocks of each of these is listed. This is Barry Sears secret for designing meals that don't cause excessive secretion of insulin.<br />Excessive insulin secretion causes sugar to be withdrawn from the blood stream and converted and stored as body fat. Probably, if you had a big crowd of people, some of them thin and some of them extra fat, you could easily sort them into two groups: the thin ones, who follow the sort of diet outlined in this cookbook, and the fat ones who don't.<br />Most of the recipes here are for dinner.

A large color photograph on page 114 shows a water stained menu recovered from the body of a third-class passenger.<br />It says that the third-class breakfast on the morning of April 12, 1912 was oatmeal porridge and milk, smoked herrings, jacket potatoes, tripe and onions, fresh something something (seawater has eaten away the print) and butter, marmalade and (illegible again) bread. Beverages were tea and coffee. <br />Who eats a more nutritious breakfast now?<br />Dinner in the third-class dining saloon was vegetable soup (made from scratch), roasted pork with sage and onions, green peas, boiled potatoes, plum pudding with sweet sauce, cabin biscuits and (a real delicacy for the time) oranges. When was the last time you had a plum pudding with sweet sauce or vegetable soup made from scratch? If it's been too long, you can make these and other things on the third-class dinner or tea menu, using recipes in this book.<br />Titanic's third-class accommodations were clean and comfortable and its two dining saloons were white and well lit. They had to be. The Titanic expected to compete with many other ships for the trade of millions of immigrants bound for America. And that's where the White Star steamship line hoped to make its money, not from the flashier passengers in first- and second-class.<br />Food in second-class was pretty grand, rather like a middle-class family's Sunday dinner when somebody important was expected to visit. A second-class menu for April 14, 1912 says that the first course was consomme with tapioca. Second course offered a choice from among baked haddock with sharp sauce, curried chicken and rice, lamb with mint sauce or roast turkey with savory cranberry sauce. Side dishes were turnip puree, green peas, boiled rice and boiled or roast potatoes. Turnip puree was delicious, actually, judging by its recipe. The dessert course insecond class offered more choices than the third-class menu, but plum pudding and sweet sauce were there, just as in third-class.<br />The book gives recipes for anything in these first, second and third courses which really needs a recipe. There is even a recipe for making a special second-class dessert delicacy: American Ice Cream. <br />First-class meals were spectacular, and they were served in a variety of cafes, saloons, restaurants and reception rooms. You'd prefer the meals in first class to those in third- or second-class. You can trust me on this.<br />And so, another pleasant surprise is that the book gives menus and recipes for a vast, complete first-class dinner which you can make for yourself and some especially fortunate friends. Plus, there's a two-page make-ahead chart. It tells how to divide your dinner-making chores into several groups, starting three days before dinner.	2001-04-30

There's an opening chapter about the general principles for growing all kinds of berries (or small fruits, as they are called, not because of the size of the fruits, but because of the size of the plants they grow on). Then, surprisingly, there is an interesting chapter about using berry plants for landscaping. It says, for instance, that elderberry bushes make good hedges.<br />There are separate chapters for each of these fruits: strawberries, brambles (raspberries, blackberries and the like), blueberries, grapes and minor berry crops (currants, gooseberries, hardy kiwi, elderberries, highbush cranberries, amelanchiers  and still more minor berry crops such as cranberry, edible honeysuckle, jostaberry, ligonberry, maypop, rugosa rose and wineberry).<br />There's a highly useful appendix listing nursery sources for berry plants. Also, there's a glossary, a valuable list of references and 12 pages of plant name index and subject index.<br />If you're interested in growing one kind of berry, such as raspberries, you can count on having about a hundred pages of information that are directed toward growing raspberries, including the part applicable to growing any berry. And this is true for each of the other kinds of berry.<br />The chapter on brambles gives historical background and describes the biology of brambles. It lists many different cultivars of raspberries and blackberries, telling the hardiness, time of berry maturation and relative productivity of each berry cultivar. <br />Bowling tells how to select and prepare a site, plant berries and establish their growth, apply nutrition and fertilization, prune brambles and make trellises. She tells how to cope with pests such as viral diseases, gray molds, anthracnose, Phytophthora root rot and a long list of insects. Surprisingly, she chose not to include birds in her list of raspberry pests, although she mentions them in connection with other berries. She doesn't mention any mammals as raspberry pests, either. Most likely, these will be local issues. Not everyone has deer, black bear or rabbits in the neighborhood.<br />Of course, you should supplement this book with information from your local ag extension service or nursery. They will have a finer level of local detail about favored cultivars. Sometimes, your local ag extension agent will disagree with this author. For example, this author says that the \\"Blackhawk\\" black raspberry cultivar is tender, with medium productivity. The extension service at North Dakota State University, a state with a brutal winter, says that \\"Blackhawk\\" is \\"one of the hardiest black fruited varieties.\\" <br />You'll need to adjust the book's information in terms of your specialized knowledge of your own local climate. For instance, this author describes the \\"Boyne\\" cultivar as a summer-bearing red raspberry suited for the climate of New England. She doesn't mention it in connection with the Midwest. The North Dakota State University Extension Service, on the other hand, says that \\"Boyne\\" is \\"excellent for [North Dakota] home gardens ... moderately vigorous, sturdy, winter hardy and very productive.\\"<br />The important thing is that Bowling has listed many, many cultivars, together with enough information for a grower to know the right climate for each one.	2001-04-28

The Inner Dummy needed a good editor to cut it in half. This sprawling, wordy book actually is two entirely different books, one of which nobody needs to read. <br />The part that nobody needs to read is the story of Sigmund Freud's supposed return to earth, after being dead 60 years, to participate in an advertising agency's project to market products based on the author's -- David L. Weiner's -- concept of an Inner Dummy. <br />The chapters which tell this story -- and they do make up half of the book -- are an especially tedious way for Weiner to explain his concept of an Inner Dummy, which he loosely bases on Freud's concept of the Id. Weiner's Inner Dummy is just the unreasonable, irrational part of us that hungers for one thing or another and gets some of us in more or less trouble as we try to appease our hungers.	2001-04-24

For example, Joseph Stalin studied \\"The Prince.\\" And he rose from humble beginnings to become sole owner of the Soviet Union and many lesser satellite states.<br />He seems to have felt that chapter 7, \\"Of Those Who Have Attained the Position of Prince by Villainy,\\" did not apply to him, for he disregarded its most important advice. Speaking of cruelties, Machiavelli had said, \\"Cruelties ill committed are those which, although at first few, increase rather than diminish with time.\\" Machiavelli also said that despots who increase their cruelties with time find it impossible to maintain themselves.<br />And this proved true of Stalin. After a long life full of cruelties and murder, he finally convinced everyone that no one was safe from him. Finally, as an old man in increasing need of medical attention, he prepared to murder a large number of doctors, in the so-called Doctors' Plot.

One naturally expects that &quot;Galileo's Daughter&quot; is a book about Galileo's daughter, much the way \\"Ada, the Enchantress of Numbers : A Selection from the Letters of Lord Byron's Daughter and Her Description of the First Computer\\" is a book about Lord Byron's daughter.<br />But no. This is not the story of Galileo's daughter, nor is it the story of a father-daughter relationship. Instead, it's an abridged biography of  Galileo, padded with letters from his illegitimate daughter, Sister Maria Celeste.<br />All of the letters from Galileo to his daughter have been lost or destroyed. So the conversation is one sided. And her letters contribute nothing to an understanding of Galileo. They are endlessly repetitive, consisting of  pleas for money and hum drum details of daily life. Worse, the letters interrupt the story at awkard moments, with details about table cloths or Galileo's laundry halting the story of Galileo's scientific achievments.<br />Galileo's daughter's letters are nothing new. Stillman Drake (Galileo at Work) mentions them. And there are several other books that deal with Sister Maria Celeste.<br />Instead of reading this book, read any book about Galileo by Stillman Drake.	2001-04-06

For example, the IRS auditor repeatedly telephoned Aczel at his home before dawn, depriving Aczel, his wife and small baby of sleep. Wanting to avoid such a nasty experience in the future, Aczel used his statistical skills to detect the rules that the IRS uses to choose taxpayers to audit. <br />He used a super computer to compare thousands of audited income tax returns with thousands of other returns which were not audited. The result is this fascinating book. It explains 14 rules for avoiding an IRS audit.	2001-03-26

Solzhenitsyn describes the gritty details of the arrests, tortures, kangaroo court trials and murders or imprisonments that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union inflicted on countless millions of people while Lenin or Stalin were in power. He gives exact details about the coarse criminality and ingenious cruelty of Communist prison officials whom he watched while he was in prison. He also weighed and sifted evidence that he gathered from other prisoners and he reports it here.<br />Solzhenitsyn entered prison a convinced Marxist. He gradually lost his Communist faith only after many years of physical and emotional abuse by other Marxists. The hope of a free lunch in a Communist paradise dies hard.	2001-03-14

He also wrote several books about weather. Later he produced manuals and three-dimensional models of weather phenomena for training military flyers during World War II. <br />His interest in weather drew him toward old diaries and almanacs that were filled with the weather lore of early American countrymen. And this, in turn, acquainted him with the countryman's reverence for wood.<br />One result was this wonderful book, whose prose is illustrated with more than 70 of Sloan's skilful pen-and-ink drawings. There's an excellent marriage between his writing and drawing. Just when you wonder exactly what some of his words might mean, along comes another drawing to make everything perfectly clear again. Many of the drawings are very detailed and packed with fascinating information about long ago wood lore.<br />If you like this book, you'll probably enjoy anything written by May Theilgaard Watts, a fine naturalist who knew how to draw.

Hardy, the English mathematician. Hardy's character was as remarkable for things that he didn't do as it was for things that he did.<br />When Ramanujan sent his first letter to Hardy, enclosing valuable mathematical results, Hardy could have laid it aside, unread or undervalued. Other mathematicians did. Instead, Hardy sent an emissary half way around the earth to bring Ramanujan to England. Once Ramanujan arrived in Cambridge, Hardy could have taken credit for Ramanujan's work and seen him off, back to India. Other men have done worse.<br />Also, one of the worst things that can happen to a brilliant man such as Ramanujan is to have a powerful but duller teacher who can not take second place to a brighter student. Hardy recognized Ramanujan as a far better mathematician and nurtured him without envy. That is one of the most remarkable things about this story.<br />It is easy to be anachronistic about Hardy and Ramanujan. It's easy to put sneer quotes around Hardy's \\"discovery\\" of Ramanujan, now that there are Indian names in most large American telephone books. And it's easy to fault Hardy for failing to enrich Ramanujan's food with vitamin D, years before its discovery. All it takes is to know little or nothing of Ramanujan's times.<br />To a small extent, the author of this book does the equivalent. Still, this is a deeply interesting story, very well told. Reading it, you'll learn why Ramanujan died so early, tightly constrained by the limitations of his own era. And you'll learn why his early death was such a great loss.<br />It's a pity that Ramanujan wasn't born later, say in 1927. Read this book and imagine what Ramanujan could have done with a pocket calculator, during a long life.	2001-03-06

Instead, the hurricane turned and headed toward Galveston, Texas. <br /> Would the Weather Service detect the real path of the storm in time? Would it warn Galveston? Would the city survive?<br /> Written from the point of Isaac Monroe Cline, the weatherman on the scene who failed to warn Galveston in time, every chapter will thrill you.	2001-03-04

It's not about structural fats. So it doesn't have much to say about fats as components of cell membranes in, say, the eyes or brain. Nor is it about fats as the source of building materials for such vital messenger molecules as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes.<br />It's mostly about such things as fat storage depots, the special locations where fats are stored. It tells a great deal about fat storage depots in animals as varied as hares, humans, bears, seals, camels, horses, lions, stoats, birds and squirrels. It also tells a great deal about fats as the energy source during hibernation, migration or other times when food supplies are chancy. And it discusses digesting, transporting and using fats as an energy source, as insulation and as protection for vital organs, from an evolutionary viewpoint<br />The book is meant for a lay audience, not scientists, so it lacks references. Sometimes this causes problems. For example, the book says that eating sugar is not an important source of weight gain in humans. But there is no reference to support this claim.  There are chapter notes at the end of the book. Otherwise, there is no bibliography. There are eighteen black-and-white illustrations.	2001-03-02

Wonderful illustrations and maps	Paris Buildings and Monuments is the superb achievement of Michel Poisson, a Paris architect. He made more than 850 drawings showing more than 500 well-chosen buildings. These drawings show everything that you need to know to decide whether to visit one of these buildings. Many of the drawings are front elevations. Some are floor plans. Others are three-quarter views. Still others are bird's-eye views.<br />Thanks to his carefully thought out design, the author makes it easy for you to find any of these building. First, he has organized the books to follow Paris's system of arrondissements. The book begins with the 1st Arrondisesment and continues, arrondissement by arrondissement, through the 20th Arrondissement.<br />There's an excellent, handdrawn map for each arrondissement, showing the exact location of each building described in the text. Also, there are smaller maps of neigborhoods within arrondissements, as well as bird's-eye views of larger building complexes such as the Louvre. <br />There is ample text describing each building, including the name of the architect who designed it and the name of the patron who paid for its construction.<br />The author shows the location of the Metro station nearest each building and makes it very easy for you to reach each building.	2001-02-24

Other people had been leaving the farm for generations, to become lawyers. Not he.<br />After a lot of thought, he decided to use horses on his farm, not tractors. Old horses make new horses, but old tractors just wear out, he said. Then he decided to become a sheep farmer, because raising sheep takes less labor than almost any other kind of farming. Plus, old sheep make new sheep.<br />This is the book that taught him how to be a sheep farmer. Ten years later his old sheep are still making new sheep. Plus, he has a lot more stimulating companionship in his new job, he said.<br />Who could ask anything more from a book?<br />Watch for the new edition, due out in June, 2001.

Reddell (owner of Garden Valley Ranch, a commercial flower ranch in the San Francisco area) and Galyean (head gardener of its fragrance garden) have devised a rich palette of fragrant plants. <br />They've assembled a marvelous list of fragrant trees and shrubs, vines and trailers, strongly scented roses, herbs, annuals, biennials and perennials, as well as bulbs, corms, rhizomes, tubers, ground covers, water plants, fragrant grasses and scented roots.<br />They tell how to distinguish between fragrances, predict the strength of a fragrance and separate scented flowers and leaves into fragrance groups based on the predominating chemical substance of their essential oils.<br />And of course they tell how to select fragrant plants, where to buy them, how to grow them, landscape with them and preserve them.	2001-02-20

For instance, there are sixteen illustrations of the art of Giambattista Tiepolo, but two for his less talented son, Giandomenico Tiepolo. There are concise captions for each illustration.<br /> The result is a splendid record of Italian art and artists, spanning seven centuries. It's the most complete collection of its kind.	2001-02-20

It's a short book, at 72 pages, but it covers, however briefly, artists' materials used in drawing, as well as a large number of drawing techniques and subjects.<br />Artists' materials covered include pencils &amp; colored pencils, pens &amp; inks,  chalks &amp; charcoal, pastels, watercolors and paper. Techniques covered include ways of working, getting started, linear drawing, tonal drawing, layout &amp; construction, forms and modeling. And subjects covered include buildings &amp; architecture, interiors &amp; exteriors, landscapes, figures &amp; drapery, life drawing &amp; portraits, movements &amp; gestures and drawing for painting.<br />This is a good catalog of drawing techniques and subjects, but if you're interested in learning to make accurate, detailed, realistic drawings, it's not the one for you.

It allowed small English armies to dominate larger French armies for a long time. The wonder was that English bowmen did not use such a potent weapon to sweep away their own kings and princes, or that slow-firing, less accurate gunpowder weapons were able to displace it so quickly.<br />Read this book and learn why.	2001-02-14

Queen Elizabeth I visited his house many times. And Rudolph II, the Holy Roman Emperor, welcomed his visits. Yet Dee died destitute despite his fame and brilliance.<br /> His steep decline is a fascinating story, which Benjamin Woolley tells very well. He could have made a better job of his tale, though, if he had compared Dee's fate with that of his friend John Field, the English mathematician and astronomer.<br /> Instead, Woolley dismisses John Field with a couple dozen words.<br /> In 1555 Queen Mary had both men thrown in jail, in the same cell, as Woolley mentions. She suspected them of heresy because of Dee's work with magic.<br /> There was some risk that Queen Mary would burn both of them at the stake, as heretics. Instead, she let them go, but their fates were very different. She deprived John Dee of his post as rector of Upton, which he never regained. And, although Woolley doesn't mention it, Queen Mary knighted John Field in 1558 for his contributions to astronomy.<br /> Sir John Field, known in his time as &quot;The English Astronomer,&quot; computed and published an astronomical ephemeris for the year 1557, based on the Copernican heliocentric system. This was the first publication in England of any document that directly claimed that the Copernican heliocentric system correctly described our solar system. It was a risky business for John Field and he could have been burnt at the stake for it.<br /> John Dee contributed a forward to John Field's ephemeris of 1557, in which he claimed credit for persuading John Field to compute his ephemeris. Then, as Woolley says, John Dee dropped form sight for six years. Sir John Field, on the other hand, steadily continued to compute and publish ephemerises for 1558, 1559 and 1560.<br /> Sir John lived in comfort and died owning much land and a hundred pounds sterling. He is an ancestor of Cyrus Field, who laid the Atlantic telegraph cable and an ancestor of Marshall Field, the Chicago department store magnate.<br /> Woolley has it that John Dee was the sole author of Sir John Field's ephemeris of 1557. He lists Dee as the sole author in the bibliography of this book, The Queen's Conjuror. In this he very much disagrees with J.L.E. Dryer, author of A History of Astronomy from Thales to Kepler, who mention Dee's forward to Field's 1557 ephemeris and credits Sir John Field with sole authorship of the actual ephemeris.<br /> Curiously, Woolley cites another of Dryer's books, Tycho Brahe: A Picture of Scientific Life and Work in the Sixteenth Century. He does not cite Dryer's A History of Astronomy from Thales to Keple. Perhaps he has not read it.<br /> Buy his book anyhow.
