Ariel Glucklich's \\"Sacred Pain: Hurting the Body for the Sake of the Soul\\" is a fabulous look at religious pain.  In an area with so few books already, a book like Glucklich's is a gem. <br /> <br />The author takes many approaches to the topic, ranging from anthropological, physiological, sociological and psychological to break down the use of pain (both self-inflicted and inflicted by others) into an insightful, understandable read.  The book is filled with massive amounts of great content, as well as excellent citations from other good works and scholars, as well.  The book is academic and scholarly, but hardly a dry read. <br /> <br />I purchased this book because of my academic interest in body modification and pain ritual, but used it massively in a 'Religion and Psychology' course.  I still find myself removing it from the shelf every now and again to look something up. <br /> <br />Whether you ultimately agree with what the book presents, one will still find the book very interesting and thought-provoking.	2005-01-12

This is, of course, the point.   <br /> <br />As a teacher, Valerie Kirschenbaum discovered that many students who wouldn't otherwise be motivated to read would happily do so if the text was more visually engaging.  This book is a response to that.  And visually engaging it is.  She presents to us a huge book filled to the brim with stunning colour on high-gloss pages and fabulous design. The issue?  Books don't have to look boring.  They SHOULDN'T look boring.  This one certainly doesn't. <br /> <br />This book should have appeal to a broad range of readers: book nuts, graphic artists, publishers, authors, teachers, etc, etc.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys books or has a library worthy of this gem.	2005-01-12

Having absolutely no experience with any form of martial arts ever, I was probably far outside the target audience for this book.  Despite this, I found it to be one of the best books I have read in the past year. <br /> <br />I found \\"On the Warrior's Path\\" to be amusing, engaging, and thought-provoking.  It is impossible to summarise the book in a way that captures all that it encompasses, because it covers so much.  Read it. <br /> <br />The writing style is very down-to-earth and easy to follow, but does not sacrifice content or deeper ideas in the process.  The author draws from many eclectic sources, but does so in a way that is relevant and interesting.   <br /> <br />Most importantly, the author's message can be meaningful and relevant in anyone's life -- the warrior, the poet, man or woman, martial artist or not.	2005-01-12

Admittedly, I was a little disapointed when I found out this text wasn't written by Rabbi Benjamin Blech (author of Idiot's Guide's to Understanding Judaism, Jewish History/Culture and Learning Yiddish).  However, I found myself pleased with the book and the knowledge of the author. <br /> <br />Rabbi Aaron Parry takes the extremely complex topic of the Talmud, Judaism's oral tradition, and breaks it down into an easy-to-understand (yet still intellectual) approach.  In addition to the in-depth explanation, the entire book is peppered with little Talmudic quotes of wisdom. <br /> <br />Rabbi Parry covers information on the writings that make up the Talmud, the organisation of the pages and the orders.  It points out which commentaries are where and discusses the sages that wrote them.  The book also includes plenty of relevant background information on the creation of the Talmud and those who wrote and contributed to it, as well as explaining modern day application of Talmudic law and important issues of discussion within the Talmud.   <br /> <br />I may not be about to go out and study Talmud myself after reading the text, but at least I'll be able to understand if other people are discussing it!	2004-11-12

The \\"Poisonwood Bible\\" was mandatory reading my senior year of high school but it remains one of my favourite novels to this day. I remember it was also one of the best-liked among my classmates of all our required readings.     \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is a fictional tale that chronicles the lives of a family from their innocence entering the Congo on a missionary trip in the 50's to their lives years later after the family's undoing.  The story is told through the perspective of the mother and her four children over the course of several decades.    This book blends religion, politics and human psychology into one wonderful masterpiece. The characters are interesting, unique and very dynamic. The plot is complex, moving, believable... and never boring! Many of the political and religious issues in this book are based in truth, though the characters themselves are a product of the mind of Kingsolver. Though there are some inaccuracies on the side of Baptist theology and a few other minor areas, the book is otherwise fantastic. Have tissues handy; this book can be both deeply sad and uplifting.     A few people have critised this book as \\"anti-white\\" or \\"anti-male\\" because the primary antagonist character in the book -- Nathan Price -- is both. The fact that the most flawed and unlikeable character in the book happens to embody both these characteristics is really irrelevant; I did not get the impression that Kingsolver was trying to generalise this to all whites or males, either intentionally or subconsciously. There are both good and bad white characters and good and bad men in this book. Her *true* message seems to be that of self-preservation over dogmatic ideologies, both political and religious, regardless of gender or race.	2004-09-11

The primer is very basic (and affordable!) but covers all the bases in a brief but eloquent way.  Unlike some more advanced intro texts, this book has excellent clarity on its points and those who aren't fond of advanced philosophy will be able to follow along.<br />While there are other good introductory texts (like Cobb and Griffin's &quot;Process Theology: An Introductory Exposition&quot;), those are more advanced in language and explanation and may lose first-time readers on process thought.  Unlike those, this primer is much more simple without being dumbed-down.<br />If you're new to process theology and want a very basic explanation, this is the place to start.  At the very least, this book will allow you to decide whether there's something in the theology worth investigating further (and buying more advanced texts) or whether you find it too radical to continue studying.	2004-05-09

Though its primary focus is tattooing, piercing and scarification, it also has sections neck elongation and body painting (henna is specifically discussed).  The book briefly discusses other cultures, but is mostly on modern, Western modification.<br />The book is well organised and each section is complimented with good photos (albeit sparingly).  Some of the content is a bit outdated or inaccurate, but for the most part is well done.<br />I gave the book 3 out of 5 stars because, while it is well done, both the content and the photography was significantly less valuable than that found in other books (\\"Return to the Tribal\\" and \\"Modern Primitives\\" are much better).  The photos were good, but there were relatively few within the book.  As aforementioned, the content was interesting and well structured, but a tad outdated and in some places inaccurate.<br />If you're looking to expand your collection on body modification books, this is worth buying.  However, if you're just looking for a starter book, I'd recommend \\"Modern Primitives\\" (or even \\"Return to the Tribal\\") instead.	2004-05-07

The book is relatively short, but is packed with great photos and content.<br />If you don't already own Modern Primitives, you might want to start there first.  This book doesn't have as good of written content, though I personally found it to have better and more varied photography.<br />Overall, the book is a must-have for the library of anyone interested in body modification (either on a tribal level or in Western culture).  &quot;Return Of the Tribal&quot; could work as a (small) coffee table book or a reference text. Short, but very sweet.	2004-05-07

This book is probably the ideal starter text for those new to learning about the religion.<br />&quot;What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam&quot; is a wonderful starter text.  It is written in the format of questions-and-answers.  The book is excellently organised with a complete index, as well as a simple glossary.  The questions asked (and answered) are importantly and relevant.  Using this method, Esposito both introduces the readers to the termonology but also the scriptures, history, culture(s) and beliefs.<br />The book gets four stars because -- like others have said -- Esposito tends to glaze over a lot of negative aspects that are commonly critised instead of responding to it.  However, I feel this is for brevity and not as necessary in this text as it would be in another introductory book.	2004-05-04

I'd recommend it to anyone, no matter their religion or level of knowledge; everyone is bound to learn something from this book.<br />&quot;Jewish Literacy&quot; covers a vast (and I mean vast) range of topics relating not just to Jewish religious beliefs but also culture, customs, scripture and history.  Despite the massive amount of topics, the book is still in-depth enough on each topic to give the reader a decent understanding.<br />The &quot;readability&quot; of this text is excellent.  &quot;Jewish Literacy&quot; is flexible in purpose; one can read straight-through or can consult it like a reference encyclopedia.  It is well organised, flows well and is consequently ideal for either situation.  In addition, the book uses language the average reader can understand and explains even the most basic of Jewish terminology for those very unfamiliar with Judaism.<br />If you are going to own one book on Judaism, this should be it!	2003-12-29

Overall: Best Available	Margot Adler's &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; is one of the few books on neo-paganism that is written to serve both the outsider and insider.  Written mostly from a sociological/anthropological/historical perspective, it separates itself from the grand majority of other books on contemporary paganism in that it does not contain a bunch of spells and 'how-to's.  The book is written for the intellectual reader, making it easily the best book available for someone who wants to learn ABOUT modern paganism rather than how to BECOME neo-pagan.<br />Though Adler is an insider to the faith, most of her writing is objective reporting.  She covers a broad scope of topics and opinions.  Her book is well written, not dumbed-down and usually academic.  Her language is scholarly but easy-to-follow.  Some reviewer complained the book reads like a textbook; this is true.  Though the book flows much more than a textbook, it usually addresses topics in the same approach.  This is exactly WHY I like the book... if I wanted spells, flowery stories and &quot;gee, the goddess is nifty&quot; shpeals, I would have bought a Ravenwolf text.<br />The aforementioned qualities are what make Adler's book a gem.  However, I do have some critiques of Adler's work.<br />Adler does have a tendency to depart from her objectivism and frolic off into personal stories which are usually not relevant, important or of interest to those reading purely for education.  She also tends to emphasis &quot;feeling&quot; over &quot;knowledge&quot; (not to say they aren't often hand-in-hand); implying many times that pagans are often so because it &quot;feels right&quot; rather than &quot;it is truth&quot; [in their eyes].  While some might not have a problem with this, it does depart from the intellectual approach her text normally takes.<br />She also displays an obvious bias against some branches of neo-paganism as well as one against the monotheism of the Abrahamic faiths.  In regard to the latter offense, this usually consists of broad generalizations as well as oversimplifications.  For example, I'd highly doubt that a member of Judaism, Christianity or Islam would say they are a monotheist because it &quot;simplifies things for them so they don't have to acknowledge the dynamic aspect of the world.&quot;  Most followers are on that path because they think it's *truth* not because they lack perspective.<br />Lastly, as many other readers have put it: the book is outdated.  While most of the text is still important and relevant, neo-paganism and witchcraft has changed ENORMOUSLY in the past few decades.  Tons of additional information could (and should) be provided.  Since the book is already pretty large, I'd recommend a volume II.  Given the quality of this book and the fact that no one else has managed to do a decent text as of recent, I would trust few besides Adler to do a high-quality update on contemporary paganism.	2003-11-11

The book has hundreds of pictures, wonderful in-depth interviews with important figures and tons of other great content.  Though it focuses primarily on those in the world of body modification today, it also refers back to the origins and meanings in past and present cultures.<br />The interviews are relevant, interesting and very readable.  You could sit down and read the text like a novel or you could simply refer to them for reference as necessary.<br />The best part is that this book takes an approach that will speak to those reading for personal reasons *and* those reading for academic interest.  &quot;Modern Primitives&quot; is entertainly while still highly intellectual.  The text is not sensationalistic like many are; it does not set out to shock the reader or obscenely glorify body ritual -- but simply to educate and inform.	2003-11-11

This book is not for those who are serious about their religion or serious about learning about contemporary paganism.  This book is for people who like having their beliefs trivialised, sanitised and dumbed-down.  This book is not even for beginning witches; it's more depressingly funny than it is educational.<br />Obviously intended to be mass-marketed to teens, this book makes no attempts at providing valuable information.  Instead, it focuses on offering a plethora of recipes for spells in an attempt to grab the interest of teens.  The spells themselves are not even serious in nature; stopping parents from inflicting harsh punishments on you when you do wrong, getting cute boyfriends and fighting -- get this -- locker elves.<br />On top of offering ridiculous \\"information\\" and cheesey spells, Ravenwolf presents a reality of witchcraft that is, in fact, not reality.  Her idea and very definition of witchcraft (that which the entire premise of the book is based on) is very limiting and -- dare I say -- inaccurate.  This book is not about witchcraft, it's about making money by presenting the author's own ideas as fact in a way that will make teenagers eat it up.<br />In truth, Ravenwolf's 'Teen Witch' is about as representative of modern witchcraft and neo-paganism as Disneyland is to reality.  Whitewashed, simplified and often outright incorrect, this book has NO value as a text medium (maybe firewood).  Furthermore, when presented from a condescending tone (which we as readers need, since we apparently are not up on par intellectually with the Great Silver RavenWolf) this book should be offensive to any reader and at age.<br />Do yourself a favour and buy a REAL book on modern witchcraft.	2003-10-24

This book presented a suprisingly well-balanced view into the world of Israel's Haredim.  Written from an outsider perspective, you'd expect the text to be overly critical and harsh.  However, I was pleased to find that it wasn't.<br />The author does a good job at portraying the life of the Haredim in a curious yet understanding way, while still being critical at appropriate times.  Heilman does not rain down flattery but also does not shy away from asking difficult questions.  While keeping an intellectually honest front, Heilman brings out thought-provoking discussions and presents perspectives that the rest of us outsides may not ever agree with, but can -- at the very least -- understand where the Haredim are coming from.<br />There are not a great deal of books on the so-called &quot;ultra&quot; Orthodox Jews available, and many that are are horribly biased against the way of life that seems so extreme to many of us.  Heilman's text is definitely one I'd recommend because it keeps middle ground, explores deeply but still manages to be respectful to his subjects.	2003-10-24

Honestly, I'm rather surprised its so popular among Christians.<br />My biggest complaint is that Strobel's reporting is one-sided in several aspects. For one, all the scholars he interviews are all conservative, evangelical Chrisitans. Not once did he interview a person of who might have been more liberal... much less interview a non-Christian scholar on Christian or Biblical studies (and there are many).<br />Furthermore, never *once* did Strobel look to find rebuttals or other perspectives on the statements and evidence that these scholars gave him. Many of the information he received was controversial or from a very narrow viewpoint. This supposedly \\"excellent researcher\\" made no effortto seek a response to this evidence (even if he ultimately sought a rebuttal to said response). <br />No liberal Christians, no Jews, no Muslims, no secular scholars were ever consulted either for opinion, viewpoint or rebuttal. Very shallow \\"reporting and research.\\"<br />Lastly, I was suprised how easier Strobel was convinced (makes you doubt how much of a skeptic he really was). Much of the evidence presented by the scholars is subjective or circumstantial, yet Strobel takes it as gospel (excuse the pun). It makes me wonder that if he'd investigated any other religion he might have turned up as a die-hard Hindu.<br />Strobel is a good writer, and he addresses issues that are important to Christians, but this book in no way deserves the publicity or five-star reviews it has received.	2003-05-06

I think that Spong's effort in reforming Christianity is a noble one, but this book makes it appear that Spong is more interested in simply &quot;tossing out&quot; outdated ideas rather than changing them.  There is a line between fixing things that are wrong and simply ignoring them &quot;because they aren't nice&quot;; Spong falls on the wrong side of this line.  He rarely uses Biblical arguments for his positions, instead backing them up by saying that they're not compassionate ideas.  Compassionate or not, if God willed them, does it really matter?  I would have appreciated a more scriptural approach to his ideas of reformation.  Instead of arguing that his God's rules aren't pink bunnies and flowers, it would have been more effective had he argued from the position that God didn't will these things in the first place.<br />For the record, I am neither conservative or Christian... and while I agree with many of his beliefs on social reformation, I don't think that the best way to accomplish them is to simply toss out beliefs that don't sit well.	2003-05-06

Though a dry read at times, this book gives an interesting look at how for once in the history of deaf culture the *hearing* adapted for the deaf instead of vice versa.  While most people might assume that the large deaf population would force a hefty amount of deaf people to adapt to hearing life, the opposite was actually true; the brilliance of Martha's Vineyard was that nearly all hearing people knew sign language to some degree.<br />The book analyses cultural impact of the large deaf population within the Vineyard's communities, which was biologically caused by the genetic predisposition for deafness.  The book, largely written like an anthropological study, focuses on both physical and cultural aspect of the deafness in the communities.  However, the most interesting implications within the book are those discussing deaf and hearing interrelations.	2003-05-05

This book has so much information it may take you two reads to absorb it all -- but that's okay because the book is funny and amusing.  You will never be bored reading this.  This book is valuable to Jews wishing to learn about their history and to non-Jews wishing to gain a closer look at the history and culture of the Jewish people.  This book will not disapoint.	2003-05-05

While this book seems to have gotten rave reviews from other readers, I was disappointed with the text (keep in mind I am not a Christian, either).  I think the other reviews may be largely influenced by other *bad* books in this area, or by personal biases.<br />This book was not worth the price for several reasons.  For one, it is not nearly in-depth as it should be.  McKinsey brings up a vast selection of errors but rarely addresses appologetic responses... and if he does, he does not address appologetic rebuttals to his response.  Many of the things he brings up as points have reasons behind them that appear to be equally as valid as some of his reasons against them (metaphors, cultural explainations, etc).<br />Furthmore, he appears to be reaching on many of his points.  As one example, McKinsey makes the claim that the Bible cannot be true because one parable refers the mustard seed the smallest seed when it is, in fact, not.  This seems just silly as the reference appears to be more of a litary hyperbole than a statement on botany.  There are other examples similar to this one throughout the book.<br />This book succeeds to showing good evidence that the bible is fallible, but because most of his arguments are far too shallow.  Atheists who purchase this to gain \\"ammunition\\" are going to be frustrated when they receive appologetic responses for nearly every point he brings up (some rather logical, admittedly some not).  Biblical scholars purchasing this book are going to be disappointed at the lack of depth.<br />This books serves as a useful tool for basic arguments and a nice summary of biblical contradictions, but is in no way the be-all-end-all of biblical errancy books.	2003-05-05

This is a book all Americans should read, whether they ultimately end up agreeing with it or not.  It is well organised and addresses many good points towards the decriminalisation of consensual &quot;victimless&quot; crimes.  Full of information and facts in addition to opinions by the author.  It's a very easy read, despite it's length; well-written and never boring.  Good for both adults and teenage students.	2003-05-02

One one level, it is hard to read -- not just because it is sad -- because it is frustrating. You want the child to get treatment so that she can live as normal of a life as possible, but you can also understand the way things appear to the poor parents who see things through the eyes of another culture. Plus with their language barrier the poor parents don't even understand WHY the horrible things their daughter is going through are for the better, according to the doctors.  <br />I read this book for a college course, but it would have been one that I would have appreciated in high school, as well.  It is a learning tool on both an anthropological and sociological level.  Good for helping people to understand that culture differences are more than \\"I am right\\" and \\"you are wrong\\"; this book allows you to see an issue from multiple sides and see things aren't always that simple.	2003-05-02

My only complaint is that there are not more of them in this book.  It is disapointingly short (about 100 pages with 1-2 quotes a page), especially for the price.	2003-05-02

Hilarious and entertaining on a surface level, and an insightful and unique perspective into philosophy and sociology (yes, I know it's just fiction).  <br />Tom Robbins has a wonderful writing style and a creative mind.  If you like unique books (how about ninja assassin Catholic monks or missplaced messiahs?), this is for you.<br />I had this book stolen (hope the thief liked it), but liked it so much I purchased it a second time.	2003-05-02

Having experience with American Sign Language for almost 10 years, I have read (and own) a great many signing books and dictionaries.  This is by far the best.  The drawings are easy to understand (which is often not the case with many books), and is accompanied by a text description as well.  Each entry also has  suggestions of the origin of the sign, but also can help a student remember the word as a memory aide.  There are many signs in here that other dictionaries do not include, though it (of course) doesn't have everything.  The signs are usually &quot;modern&quot; versions of a sign (as languages change and adapt), unlike some books which have very old signs or even signs exclusive to SEE signing.  I would recommend to anyone learning ASL.	2003-05-02

Even though I am now nearly twenty years old, this book still remains a favourite of mine. Not only is the book a thrilling tale, but it is also unique in plot. On the surface, \\"Charlott Doyle\\" is simply a riveting tale of a young girl caught in a desperate position at sea; underneath, the story contains mature themes that even adults will enjoy.	2003-01-11
