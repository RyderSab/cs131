Catch-22 is the classic war satire and while some aspects of it are a little dated, it still rings very true in the contemporary political climate. Heller's characters are all quirky, intense and unique, but their conversations and actions really penetrate the absurdity of war and are very entertaining. I personally think the larger goals of World War II were noble and worthy, but when the impact of the war on those people who were actually fighting it are examined through Heller's off-kilter viewpoint, it becomes clear that there are tremendous costs and failings when trying to achieve those goals. This is a wonderfully amusing book and for people who are interested in more than a laugh, it also has an important message. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has not read it before.	2005-08-09

Like most serials, there must be a piece that ties up some loose ends and prepares the readers for a final crescendo in one of the final installments. That is what this book does very well--it answers some of the lingering questions from earlier books and gets us set for one last battle with Voldemort.  <br /> <br />Like all of the other Potter books, this one is very well written and entertaining, but it isn't always as lively and funny as previous books. I think it has a very strong emotional component and J.K. Rowling somehow manages to make the main characters act their age perfectly (it is an impressive feat to write so accurately about both 12 year olds and 17 year olds), so it is a fine piece of writing, but it must be compared to the rest of her work and it just isn't quite as great as they were (that is to say, this is a very good book, but those were classics). I would highly recommend this book to all Potter fans, but it would be best apprecaited only after reading those books which proceeded it.	2005-08-09

Lincoln Caplan uses an indepth analysis of the practice, politics and people of Skadden Arps to analyze how and why law firms, which had traditionally been small parterships have since grown into businesses as large and competitive as many of the corporations they represent. The story is very well written and insightful and it is obvious that Caplan did extensive research both inside the firm and in legal libraries. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in legal history and it is a good insider's guide to people who do not have experience in a law firm, but are considering working in one or are simply curious what goes in them.	2005-08-08

Gideon was a poor, career criminal who was denied counsel in Florida for a charge of petty theft who challenged his right to an attorney all the way to the Supreme Court.  <br /> <br />Like all court cases, there are long, human stories that lead up to the actual trial, but unfortunately those are seldom told and the only record we are left with is court opinions. In this book, however, a New York Times reporter did a staggering amount of research to present Gideon's personal history, as well as the development of his case, the preparation of his lawyers, the actual legal machinations that led to him winning his case before the Court. It is triumphant and interesting story for most readers, but it is also very educational and inspirational for aspiring lawyers who really don't understand the way the law works in the real world and needs a reminder that the law is really about helping people. I would highly recommend this book.	2005-04-14

The Buffalo Creek disaster was a horrible tragedy in poverty-stricken coal mining region and the people who had lost relatives, their homes and their livlihoods had no where to turn until a law firm was willing to take their case and fight the large mine operators. The book is written by the lead attorney on the case, which certainly makes it slightly self-serving, but this just proves that  justice can truly can served through the law and lawyers can make the world a better place. The writing is very clear and easy, the action is fast paced and it is very educational (it somehow makes torts and civil procedure come alive). I would highly recommend this book for all aspiring lawyers or people who are already practicing.	2005-04-14

Though London is best known for his arctic adventure stories (many of his best are found in this book), the breadth of topics about which he wrote is extensive and that is demonstrated here. The things that ties all the writing together, however, are excellent writing, passion, ferocity, intelligence and a social conscience. London had many interests and was a prolific writer and this book captures his talents better than any I've seen. I would highly recommend the collection to any one who likes London, short stories, good writing or American history (since his stories capture many aspects of America in the early 20th century). This is an excellent book and I would highly recommend it.	2005-03-13

This is a political book and it has an appropriate political bias, but it is accurate and makes its points through well thought out and considerate arguments, unlike many of the conservative wind bags that Franken skewers. It did not sway me on any political issues, but Franken kept me laughing throughout and certainly does an excellent job of showing how political dialog can be civil and fact based. This is a great political book for readers who do not assume the commentator who yells loudest must be correct or that anything spouted by political experts must be taken as gospel. A highly readable, entertaining and intelligent book about contemporary politics.	2005-03-12

He is arguably the best distance runner in American history, but certainly is the most famous and charismatic American to take the track. Jordan concentrates on the facts of his life--specific races, events and people in Pre's life--without getting bogged down in analysis of who he was. There are plenty of first hand accounts from Pre's contemporaries and quotes from his friends and competitors, but Jordan realizes that Pre's actions usually spoke for themselves. He was a runner who gave his entire being to racing hard against the best competition in the world and gave equally to the Eugene, running and amateur athelete communities. His early death may have been what cemented him in America's collective memory--everyone remembers the athlete dying young--but he did so much in his short life that he is well worth the recollection. This is a must read for every runner and will also be appreciated by lovers of sport. It is a very readable book and goes quickly, so anyone can handle it. I would highly recommend this book.	2005-02-09

This isn't unusual for an athletic hero in his prime--reporters want to sell books and people like to read that their idol is also a good guy, plus reporters don't get the same access to their subjects if they don't paint them in a good light so there is some motivation to say good things--though it always sounded a little suspect. Could he really be loved by all his teammates, competitors, fans and others in his life? Sam Smith gave glimpses of an alternate version of Jordan and many people criticized his bad mouthing, but it put a small chink in Jordan's armor. Now Leahy comes around and tries to chip away much of the rest of Jordan's reputation.  <br /> <br />From the beginning of this book, Leahy portrays Jordan as an egotistical, self-centered, cruel, hypercompetitve jock. He acknowledges Jordan's greatness as a basketball player, or at least was great until he played too long, but he had serious character flaws that had been hidden by suck-ups in the media and a good pr team. Leahy had tremendous access to Jordan during the two years of his comeback and certainly has a better view of the real Jordan than I do, but I his portrait is so biased and negative at times that it feels like he has an axe to grind and often doesn't seem believable. The truth is somewhere in between Leahy's and previous biographies of Michael Jordan, but since readers will never really know, I think most would prefer to read more positive books. For critics of the media and celebrity culture, this is an excellent critique and would interest them and for people who want a different view of Jordan, it would also be valuable, but for my money, I would spend it on a different bio (one of Bob Greene's books or Sam Smith's bio).	2005-01-13

His work in the New Yorker has always been among the best material in the magazine, not only because it is excellent writing, thoughtful and elegant but because he is always amusing and tells a wonderful story. Baseball is one of his great loves and it shows in the pieces he writes about the National Pastime. He enjoys the pacing, the action, the smells, the storylines and especially the characters and he conveys this passion to his readers.  <br /> <br />Game Time is a wonderful anthology of nearly 30 essays Angell has written during his 40 years as \\"sports-writer.\\" They cover all aspects of the baseball season, many baseball personalities and the intricacies of the games. He is not just a poet who appreciates the aesthetic values of the sport, but he recognizes and discusses the strategies and skills as well as anyone. These is a great collection by one of the best baseball writers around and will provide many laughs and lessons to all baseball fans as well as people who simply love excellent non-fiction essays.	2004-09-24

It has all the characteristics of a Steinbeck story--excellent description, harsh realism, good and evil, and a moral--but it is accessible to everyone because of its length and simplicity. This would be an excellent introduction to Steinbeck for children or a good book for scholars interested in Steinbeck's view of the American dream. One of the finest stories by one of America's finest writers, The Pearl is a wonderful book.	2004-08-22

From there the story returns to the glory days of these aging men and follows their careers and private lives to explain how their lives were intertwined and how they grew together. These were extraordinary athletes who relied on each other and continued their friendships for several decades despite distance, disparate interests and contradictory personalities. Halberstam's story is an excellent one of love and commitment between old friends and it is especially good for fans of the Red Sox and baseball in general. It is written in the Tuesdays with Morrie mold, though it isn't as memorable, and anyone who liked that story would surely appreciate this one as well.	2004-08-22

The setting is Monterey, California shortly after World War I and the characters are paisanos who have little ambition other than finding adventure, drinking and being part of an adult fraternity. They resist real work and spend much of their time in search of easy money and food to steal, but despite their failings the characters remain interesting and sympathetic. Steinbeck, as always, writes about the downtrodden with masterful prose (though I'm sure there are many who find his descriptions in this book racist) and the story is fun and entertaining. High schoolers and adults alike will enjoy this book and I would recommend it to anyone, though only after they've read Steinbeck's greatest work.	2004-08-22

While George looks out for the two, Lenny's innocent curiosity and brute strength prevents them from settling in one place or realizing their dream of owning their own farm. It is the type of heart warming story only Steinbeck can write and the realistic description and charged emotion throughout is unbeatable. This is one of my favorite Steinbeck stories because it can be enjoyed with a quick, cursory reading, but there are several other levels to explore within the novella if you choose to spend the time. It is a very short story--perfect for a junior high book report or a relaxing afternoon on the couch. I highly recommend this book.	2004-08-22

I learned a lot about the history of the various fast food chains, the founders of the restaurants and their growth, but the most important part of the book is the examination of the dark side of fast food. Some reviewers of the book refer to Schlosser as a modern day Upton Sinclair, but the writing is no where near as persuasive or moving. The style is more like a John McPhee essay in that there are incredible details, interesting anecdotes and it moves in all sorts of interesting directions, but unfortunately it isn't always convincing. Yes, the fast food industry has serious flaws, but the book is often so biased that Schlosser ignores other potential causes of the problems he cites and this makes the book less effective. This book is provacative and well written, so I would certainly recommend it its alarmist content and tone should be taken with a grain of salt.	2004-08-22

Many of the essays are from the week of opening days or a post script of a season that just ended and these essays all have a similar tone and information, but all of them are well written and contain numerous facts, opinions and insights. The book also covers significant events in the history of baseball--the banning of Pete Rose, the strike of 1994, the fight for free agency and of course the yearly collapse of the Chicago Cubs, which is the team for which Will is a lifelong fanatic. This is not the best book of baseball stories I've read, but it is entertaining and thought provoking, so it deserves to be read by baseball fans and should be picked up by sports fans who want to learn why baseball is the most elegant sport and why it has so many diehard fans.	2004-08-22

Holmes who preyed during the same period. The fair's preparation began with tremendous enthusiasm in Chicago as the citizens hoped to show the world they were no longer merely the second city of America, but were one of the great cities anywhere. The city was quickly developing into the nation's manufacturing center and the energy and vitality that accompanited the growth was infused into the fair, which would eventually host millions of satisfied customers.  <br /> <br />Coinciding with the fair's preparation, however, was the start of one of America's earliest and most notorious serial killing sprees, by a physician who lived near the White City. His story is intertwined with the fair and the book's chapters alternate between the killer and the fair, which keeps the book flowing and leaves the reader with a cliff hanger after nearly every chapter. This is an excellent history book--much more like a combined history and true-crime story--and lovers of history, true crime, mysteries or even city planning or architecture will find several reasons to love this book.	2004-08-22

The book covers every aspect of school from applying, to studying, to the job search and bar exam. Aside from the specific information it provides, the book instills a great deal of confidence that law school is a doable experience and not as daunting as it can seem. The book was well written and clearly presented--not surprising for a book written by lawyers. I feel that this book provides a leg up for school and I would highly recommend it to everyone considering or attening law school.	2004-08-22

Alan Greenspan, held responsible for carefully guiding the economy through \\"soft landings\\" and then the incredible run up of the stock market, is one of the world's most respected economists, but little is known about him. He is quiet in public because he fears his statements will lead to unnecessary adjustments in the international economy, but in Maestro, Woodward does an excellent job of describing the man and explaining the innerworkings of the Fed. Much of what the bank does is secretive and complicated, but through extensive interviews and careful writing it becomes much more clear and interesting to even the least savvy reader (me). Even without a degree in economics or an overriding interest in financial markets, this is a very good book and I would recommend it for laymen as well as more academic types. Certainly it is one of the best books about economics I've read and is one of the better biographies I've read recently.	2004-08-22

The book is filled with interesting personality profiles and insights into the economics of baseball. Moneyball's main focus is Billy Beane, a former can't miss prospect coming out of high school who never lived up to expectations, but has been one of the most successful general managers in the major leagues during the past several years. The book presents an interesting story of how Beane, along with his assistants and scouts, have discarded taditional beliefs about evaluating talent and have turned to technology and unusual statistics to determine who is most likely to have a successful career. I don't know if Beane's methods are the future of baseball, or like Netscape in Lewis' The New New Thing is merely a fad, but it is innovative and worth learning about either way. This is a well written and insightful book and I would recommend it to fans of Lewis and even more to fans of baseball.	2004-08-22

Bloom is not a particularly accomplished runner, but his writing about the subject is passionate and very clear and he gives advice from numerous sources--champion runners, non-competitive running lovers and his own personal experience. All of the information in the book is helpful and presented with a touch of humor that keeps it interesting. I would recommend this book especially to first time marathoners, but competitive athletes would find many useful tidbits as well. This is a very good running guide and should be added to every running library.	2004-08-08

John Adams has been nearly forgotten by history, his presidency lasting just one term between two of the most famous men to have held that office, but McCullough reminds readers that Adams was perhaps the most critical mind in America's independence movement, one of the great diplomats of America's infancy and a great friend and mentor to many of the leaders of his era and the one that followed. It is a great American tale of a man from humble beginnings who climbs to the highest office in the land. I would highly recommend this book to American history buffs--it is assured that even the best student of American history will learn a great deal about Adams and America's foundings--and those who enjoy biographies or good non-fiction.	2004-08-08

Bryson's two road trips, covering 38 of the 48 continental United States, wind through many famous sites and cities as well as many small towns and endless boring miles in the Midwest. He takes these routes in search of the idyllic small towns he remembers from his youth and imagines, but instead finds that the strip malls, fast food joints and cheap hotels that dominate larger towns have taken hold everywhere. His descriptions of the people and places he visits are hilarious and I think it is too bad some reviewers take his comments personally. He was certainly exaggerating and generalizing his statments for humor, but that makes it entertaining. Certainly he comes off a bit whiny and sometimes mean, but that is Bryson's style and the way he writes all of his books. This is the most enjoyable Bryson book I've read to this point and I think anyone who has ever taken a car trip will appreciate it. It is excellent summer vacation reading.	2004-06-25

Instead, it highlighted many of the virtues of Alaska--the diverse people who reside there, the unsettled countryside and sense of freedom. He doesn't avoid the topic of people who froze to death in their shacks or disappeared on flights through the bush, but these are just used as entertaining anecdotes to remind the reader that Alaska is still wild. This is a very well written and entertaining book and it does an excellent job of describing the complex politics and ecology of Alaska as well as the incredible beauty of the state. If you are hoping to travel to Alaska or simply want to learn more about the state and its residents who choose to live in the middle of no where in one of the harshest climates on earth, this is an excellent book. It is good pleasure reading as well, but perhaps not beach reading so much as a good bed time or lunch hour book.	2004-06-24

It is extremely well written, the story flows smoothly and the characters are all life like. Of course, it is a biographocal novel, so most of the events and characters are drawn from real life, which makes the task of creating the story easier, but Stone breathes incredible vitality into Van Gogh and those surrounding him. It would be hard to recreate van Gogh's intensity and passion (as well as his descent into madness), but Stone does an admirable job of it. Also, through incredible research Stone takes the reader to the settings of many of Van Gogh's landscapes and introduces many of the subjects of his portraits, which helps someone as ignorant about art as me understand his vision and motivations. I don't see a problem with Stone making up dialogue and some of the scenes in the book, because they make it a richer story and even in authentic biographies, no one has perfect recall of exactly what took place. <BR>  I would say this book is not as good as The Agony and The Ecstacy, which is an absolute must read for anyone, but it is a brilliant novel and I will recommend it to everyone, even if you know nothing about art or no particular interest in Van Gogh. You will not be disappointed after reading this book.	2004-06-11

Gary Gilmore--a bright man who spent half his life in jail and eventually murdered two men in cold blood while on parole before being given a death sentance--is a fascinating example of a modern criminal. His life before his final crime and then his court battles to speed up his execution is an interesting case study and since this book is written like an extended newspaper article, it provides great insight. It also contains terrific accounts of the other tragic characters in Gilmore's life (his mother, father and girlfriend). The big fault of this book, of course, is its overwhelming length. There is no reason it needed to be over 1000 pages and after finishing it I was more than ready for it to be over. There is enough drama and action to keep the narrative flowing and to keep readers interested, but it isn't a book you can sit down and read in an afternoon, you will have to devote serious time and energy to finish it. I think the effort is worth it, but for people who do not want to commit to such an endeavor, do not read this book and buy the book by Mikal Gilmore (Gary's younger brother) or avoid Gilmore all together and buy In Cold Blood, which is a must read book and the best true crime I've ever read.	2004-06-07

Unlike Seabusciut, to which this book has been compared, however, I don't think it will appeal to people without some sort of interest in running. The book has plenty of action, engaging protagonists and the benefit of recounting one of the great athletic accomplishments ever, but Seabiscuit had all the elements and emotions necessary for an epic story, whereas this book didn't quite reach that level.<br />Bascomb did an incredible amount of research to write excellent biographies of each of the main players (enough has been written about Bannister that his story is well known, but Landy and Santee come alive in this book) and his accounts of the races are intense and dramatic, just as good sportswriting should be. The main reason I don't think everyone can relate to the story, however, is the context for why the races were so important to the world (the cultural history aspect) just isn't very persuasive or complete. I don't think this will take away from racing fans or runners (for whom this book is a must buy), but it will lessen the appeal for people who aren't captivated by a mile race. <br />All in all, I liked this book a lot. It was a quick, easy, intelligent and fun read and it will stand proud next to the rest of the running books in my collection, but it isn't for everyone.	2004-05-24
US	51101301	R18UQ2DXOWN3TY	0671241109	79559742	The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Supremely Informative	I read The Brethren because I have an interest in constitutional law and knew Woodward would do exhaustive research about the Supreme Court before writing this story. This book did not disappoint in its discussion of the constitutional issues debated in the court during the first 6 years of the Burger Court and it was a fascinating expose of the behind-the-scenes activites at the court and the personalities of the justices. Woodward does an excellent job presenting the cases in layman terms, perhaps because he began the project with no legal training himself, and it makes everything very clear for the reader. The most unsettling revelation in the book is how critical constitutional decisions often come down to compromises (&quot;I'll side with you on this case if you side with me on that case&quot;) and personality clashes, though it is important to understand that the justices are people and their determinations are often subject to human passions. I think this book is an excellent history of the court in the early 70s and a cautionary tale for the future and I would highly recommend it to people interested in the Court and/or people interested in practicing law. I would also recommend it for people interested in politics in general, because the court is obviously very political whether it tried to remain independent or not.	2004-05-19

Tai-Pan fits the bill. <br />It is an engaging story about the European community in China just after the British have taken control of Hong Kong. It centers on Dirk Struan, a manipulative, shrewd, and charismatic man who happens to be the most powerful trader in Asia. There is intrigue, violence, romance and tragedy, but this all adds flavor to the epic story of how the British controlled their first stronghold in Asia. Clavell does an amazing job of creating realistic characters and incorporaring facts about the time period and his knowledege of the culture. Despite being a fictional account of this era, I learned a great deal about China, British trade and sailing in the 1800's. <br />I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys historical fiction or just great writing and good stories. Further, this book is at least as good as Shogun and is a critical component of the Asia Saga, so it is a must read for people who enjoy Clavell's other books.	2004-04-29

It is very insightful about the world of U.S. Attorneys--both the legal and political aspects--and their prosecution of white-collar crime. Stewart chose several good case studies to analyze how prosecutors work and also highlight the political reality of their position. The book paints an unflattering picture of the Reagan Administration's handling of crimes by large businesses, including the machinations of Rudy Guliani who is made out as a machiavellian up and comer. This is a good book for people interested in law and specifically prosecution, but hopefully it does not frighten people away from such a career path. It is also has some interesting history of the Reagan Administration and Guliani, but it is fairly dated information now and doesn't have the same impact it would have when the book was first published. All in all, I would recommend this book and encourage aspiring attorneys to read it.	2004-04-15

It was just as thrilling as any Grisham novel, as informative as a text book and extremely well written. I watched the movis a couple years ago and new the basic premise of the story, but Harr does a marvelous job of building momentum throughout the book and I could not stop reading the book at night. It was just too exciting. There was excellent information about legal work, environmental catastrophes and the greater Boston area (for which I will admit a certain fondness). I learned a lot from the novel and got excited about the law, which is not an easy feat. I would recommend this book to anyone, but aspiring lawyers, environmentalists and people interested in dramas will be particularly fascinated. I cannot recommend this book highly enough--it is well worth the purchase price.	2004-04-02

I have read several great adventure books, both about Everest and other explorations, but I didn't know much about Mallory and thought this book would be exciting and informative. It was certainly good for biographical details and a history of Everest exploration, but the was a striing lack of energy and drama, which made the book seem like a text book for Everest buffs rather then an adventure story for the general public. The other major flaw with the book was its awkward transition from Mallory's history to the 1999 expedition to find his body. It was unexpected and poorly done, it would have been much better to incorporate the details of the expedition throughout the book. The writing in the book wasn't particularly strong and there were several spelling errors that were distracting, so it wasn't a book I would recommend for casual readers. It was, however, well researched, so for people very interested in Everest it is an excellent selection.	2004-03-29

The story about a dysfunctional family coming together for one last Christmas is good foundation and there are several interesting characters in the book, but the style leaves a lot to be desired. Scenes hop around, the writing is disjointed and the narrative is often hard to follow. It seemed that Franzen was trying to be avant gard and hip, but the book loses a lot of its power because of this style. I would recommend reading it as a beach book, but it could have been much more and because it failed to live up to its promise I can't give it a great rating.	2004-03-25

Rockefeller, Sr., which has been attempted by scores of authors, is nearly impossible. Chernow, however, accepted this challenge and thrived. <br />Titan is a wonderful book. His research into the Rockefeller family, Standard Oil and the society in which Rockefeller lives is staggering. He weaves it all together very well and the resulting story is wonderful. I learned a tremendous amount about the man and his world, which is of course the goal of a biography, but I never wanted to put the book down which is a quality more often found in novels then biographies. There are many interesting lessons about economics, turn of the century religion, politics and corporate America to be learned from the book and anyone interested in any of these subjects would find it fascinating. I highly recommend this biography.	2004-03-05

The character are still great, there is good action and it is an entertaining read, but it is just too long and wanders too much. For adult readers, one of the advantages of the Potter series is that the books can be read in one day--they're fun, but you can get a quick fix and move on. This edition, however, is just too much. It doesn't develop quickly enough, it meanders quite a bit in the middle and then everything is summed up too fast. Of course, this book is essential for all Potter lovers, but I hope Rowling gets back on track with her next book.	2004-03-03

I had never read Bryson before, but I cannot wait to read his other books. In this book, Bryson travels to Australia multiple time to see everything he can of the &quot;Sunburned Country,&quot; which proves to be an enormous, though empty, home to fascinating people, places and things. Using his terrific sense of humor, Bryson chronicles his tours through the cities and countryside, all the while stopping at every roadside attraction he can find. He also gives excellent historical background with adds rich texture to his stories. Bryson writes very well, tells engaging tales and really makes Australia look beautiful, welcoming and completely unique. <br />This is not an on-the-beaten-path tourist guide, rather it is a terrific journal of the real Australia that only ambitious tourists usually find, but he makes it seem like a wonderful place. I would recommend this as the first book for would be Australia visitors (it will make you very excited for your trip) or people looking for an introduction to Bryson. It is, however, a great book for anyone looking for an enjoyable book to read, regardless of their interest in the land down under and I would recommend its purchase to anyone.	2004-03-03

Roth is more accessible then critics would like you to believe--his unique style flows well, he creates realistic and lively characters and he tells compelling stories.<br />&quot;The Human Stain&quot; is about Coleman Silk, a long time professor, who resigns in disgrace after being accused of racism. After the resignation, he battles the college hoping to regain face, but he also beings dating a much younger woman who works as a janitor at his former school. Through the narration of Nathan Zuckerman, this intense action plays out and Silk's unique and hidden life history is revealed. <br />This book is a great examination of political correctness, higher education, love and especially race. It is a tremendous novel, certainly one of Roth's best, and I would highly recommend it to all readers, especially those who enjoy excellent prose, fiction and controversial themes. More specifically, I would also recommend it to people who have experienced a small New England college town--it will be an excellent reminder, both good and bad, of that life and will challenge the memories you have. This is a truly great book.	2004-02-27

The essays in the book cover a range of topics about modern America including its sexual mores, the rise of technology, art and contemporary novels. He makes many great arguments for the greatness and unique character of America and uses his intelligent wit, knowledge of philosophy and historical facts to make strong cases. His writing, as always, is excellent and the stories were insightful. This collection also includes a novella that is both fun and concise (not always Wolfe's strong suit). I think this is a fabulous book for Wolfe fans like myself, but also good for people who want a quick introduction to him without committing to an 800 page novel. Further, it would be great reading for people interested in American Studies and provides a good starting point for lengthy debates. This is a very good book and well worth purchasing.	2004-02-25

It is possible that I expected too much, but I think it is merely a less successful book. The story itself places Billy Parham and John Grady Cole, the protagonists in the previous books, together on a ranch in New Mexico in the 1940s. The setting has the same romantic feel of the other novels and there is good action throughout, but the story does not flow as well and it is less believable then the previous books. This edition relies on too many flashbacks, wasn't as well written and didn't add much to the series. I think it is important to read &quot;Cities of the Plain&quot; if you've read and enjoyed the rest of the trilogy, because the story really comes full circle here, but it is not a good starting point to become familiar with McCarthy. He has written much better material then this book and I hate to think of people thinking this is a good representation of his talent.	2004-02-23

Along the way, the wolf is killed and Billy gets in trouble, and upon his return home he finds it abandoned, his horses stolen and evidence that his family was murdered. It is a violent and dramatic introduction to the book, but the action and description is phenomenal.<br />After this section, Billy finds his younger brother unharmed and they decide to return to Mexico in search of their family's horses. Once they have made their crossing, they face several trials and adventures and they experience everything from love to betrayal to death. All of this is expertly described by McCarthy, who is simply and incredible story teller and writer. This is a superb sequel to &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; and again makes the reader long for the days of the open frontier. This is a great book for any reader.	2004-02-23

Cormac McCarthy has a unique writing style that is perfectly suited to the Western genre and he knows how to pace a story. It is a very well written book and well worth reading it for that reason alone.<br />What really makes this book special to me though is the theme of the book. It is the early 1940s and the Wild West has been fenced in, cars have taken over from horses and even the sprawling ranches of Texas are converting to large oil fields. John Grady Cole is a young man who longs to be a rancher and make a living taming horses and herding cattle, but he is prevented from doing this by his mother and the changing nature of his home, so he rides to Mexico with a friend to find the life he always wanted. Along the way, they have many adventures and relationships that keep the book lively, but I love the image of a boy standing on the border of what he has always known (Texas) and what he thinks he wants (Mexico) and hurdling that line and going after his desires. It is a very romantic idea, but one that McCarthy really makes come to life in the book. <br />I can not recommend this book highly enough and I think any lover of good writing, Westerns, coming of age tales, or just great fiction will agree that it is worth the short time it takes to read it.	2004-01-14

This book fit that bill perfectly. It gave very simple lessons about how to start the sport--the necessary equipment, where to surf, how to actually get on your board and a little history of the sport. It didn't rely on surfer lingo that muddles everything up for beginners who are not yet in the know and had a number of excellent photographs to visually capture what the words were trying to say. It is very well written for someone who does not have experience and I think it is a fantastic teaching tool. I would highly recommend this book for all beginners or parents of beginners who just want to have an idea of what their child is getting into. I can't wait to put these lessons into practice.	2004-01-14

I have watched the program off and on since junior high and have witnessed many of its ups and downs, but this book delves much deeper into the program then what is actually shown the viewer every Saturday night. I think the gossipy details of cast romances, drug use, office politics and the tragic deaths of some of the show's alums are interesting, but what really makes this book unique are its insights into the production of a television program and the television business. I have no interest in pursuing a career in tv, but I think this would be a great introduction for anyone who does. The style of the book, being an oral history with only a loose chronology, fits well with its subject matter and it is nice that the voices in the book are those of the people actually involved--the real talent--rather then the author's manipulating interviews and filtering information to fit their own opinions. It is a very quick read that will entertain any reader and is very insightful. I would recommend it to any fan of Saturday Night Live, people interested in the entertainment industry or readers who enjoy good stories and story tellers. This is one of the best books I've read this year.	2004-01-07

There isn't a single theme and the authors are not as well-known as the last issue from McSweeney's--&quot;The Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales&quot;--but it is still a great anthology. The DVD that accompanies the book is fairly low budget, but very funny and almost worth the purchase price all by itself. I would encourage people interested in this book to buy it through McSweeney's own web site if possible--it is nice to support independent publishers directly and they have a lot of neat stuff on their web site that you will miss if you buy from Amazon. This will be an enjoyable book for all lovers of quirky, funny and very well written short fiction.	2004-01-02

When he was lost in the heart of Africa, Henry Stanley, a reporter and world-traveling rogue, decided he would earn his fame and fortune finding the lost explorer. Their lives never connected until their famous meeting in Africa, but Dugard does an excellent job presenting their lives up to that fateful moment by alternating chapters and giving the sense that they were destined to meet. This is a very well written and extensively researched book and will be a great read for people who already know a lot about Stanley and Livingstone or readers like me coming to the book knowing next to nothing. It will also please readers who typically have little interest in non-fiction, because it is such a fast-paced drama. I would highly recommend this book to all readers.	2003-12-28

The pace of the story is often frenetic and it is a quick read, both of which are nice for a plane ride or quick holiday book, but this isn't something that will stick with a reader. The title leads readers to believe that this describes epic events in Las Vegas, but instead it is a bunch of kids who legally take advantage of the rules of black jack and win a lot of money for themselves. It is amusing and actually amazing, but nothing that will leave a lasting impression. It also doesn't really teach effective lessons about counting cards. It describes some basic techniques, but certainly isn't a &quot;how-to&quot; guide. I don't know that all readers are looking for these characteristics, but if you are, look elsewhere. It is a good book that is a fun, quick read, but it isn't one you will want to keep on your shelves forever and come back to time and again.	2003-12-28

It seems that this would get old, but it really never does, and the fact that this book is a true story gives it even more drama. This is an excellent book for World War II buffs, but it is an equally good read for people like me who enjoy dramatic stories, good writing and well developed characters. It is in the end an heroic story and will leave readers feeling very good about America and the men who fought in WWII, but it is certainly not mere war propaganda or revisionist history--it is very well done and I am glad I had the chance to read it.	2003-12-26

It of course focuses on Alan Webb, his achievements and his year running at Michigan, but it really describes the trials and tribulations facing all runners. The celebrity profile aspect of the book is what will initially sell the book (and the insights into Alan Webb's character and running life are interesting and worth the read), but what will make this book a staple amongst runners for years to come is how it glorifies athletics and addresses topics to which every runner will relate, such as training, frustration with poor performances, the comraderie of a team and why people love to run. It is not a profound book, but it is a quick, easy read that is insightful and reaffirming. I think these are all characteristics of good sports books and certainly makes this one worth purchasing for all runners who are interested in Alan Webb or just like reading about the sport.	2003-12-26

I can't vouch for its accuracy as I have not yet attended myself, but Turow does an excellent job of describing his anxieties, hard work, relationships and concerns about legal education. Turow writes very well and has an excellent eye for details, so the book is fun to read, but his honesty and personal insights are what really make this book memorable. I can not imagine the intensity and competitive nature of the classes, but I think it is valuble to know it exists and the worst of what I may want to be prepared for in law school.  I don't know how contemporary the book is and the complaints that the book doesn't paint an accurate portrait of law school anymore are probably fair, but I think it is still worth the short time it takes to read. I think this would be an enjoyable and interesting book for people interested in education in general and particularly for people who are hoping to pursue a legal education.	2003-09-27

I of couse knew that he was a multiple winner of the Tour de France and had conquered cancer, but this story delves much deeper into the incredible hurdles that faced him in both situations. His honesty about the disease, his relationships and the consequences of cancer (sterility and a failed romance most notably) was refreshing and made this story much more immediate and moving then I had expected. It also made him much more real and seem more amazing then I already imagined him to be. Of course, this is a biography and Armstrong has a healthy ego to begin with, so it is of course biased in his favor, but at no point did that lessen my appreciation for what he has suffered through or accomplished. <br />This book is not very well written (though there is nothing wrong with it at all, in fact it is very easy, quick reading) and it is a bit self serving at times, but its message of hope and can-do spirit is inspiring. I respect Lance Armstrong a great deal after reading this book and appreciate what he'd done more then ever before. I think everyone will appreciate this book and get something from it, whether you are a biking fan, a cancer survivor, an endurance athlete looking for motivation or someone who is interested in pop culture and notable people. It is a very well presented story and does not require much time or effort to complete.	2003-09-04

Like all of Wolfe's books it is well written, covers a lot of ground and develops substantial characters. It has so many different strains that the novel remains lively with three or four differnt threads moving quickly throughout until they join together in the end.  Each differnt story could have been a good book in itself, but combining all of them into this single epic was a difficult, but effective, trick. I can't vouch for the accuracy of the social commentary in contemporary Atlanta, but it certainly made for a compelling book. I would highly recommend this book for Wolfe fans, but it would be an excellent selection for people interested in social commentary, American studies or good, quick reading novels.	2003-09-01

Despite the hype that a blockbuster movie and multiple years on the bestseller lists give a book, Seabiscuit managed to surpass even my most ambitious expectations. The story of course revolves around an unattractive horse who belies low expectations to capture most of the greatest awards in racing and  the hearts of Americans during the last years of the depression. With the help of Tom Smith, the strong, slient trainer who devoted years of his life to Seabiscuit's development, the financial support of auto magnet Charles Howard who seemed to love the horse like a favored child, and jockies Red Pollard and Charlie Woolf, no one in racing, even the fabled War Admiral or the track stewards who saddled Seabuscuit with absurd weights in handicap races, no horse could stop the Biscuit when he was at his best (which was most of the time between his third and seventh years). <br />Aside from the stories of the characters, which are terrific, this book establishes itself as the best sports history book I've read because of the quality of writing and research. Hillenbrand lets her emotions come through very well and the action of the book is so well written that it gives the readers a perfect mental image that is so gripping it will leave you with goosebumps. I don't know the first thing about horse racing or even like watching it, but her race descriptions are outstanding. They were so good and personal that I often thought she may be embellishing and adding her own dramatic creations, but if you look at the end notes of the book, her research was exhaustive and everything she says is documented in her sources (which doesn't always make them true, but that isn't her fault).<br />Finally, this book extends much further then horse racing to analyze depression-era society. It is a great cultural history and it is so seemlessly written into the book that you don't realize all you've actually learned until analyzing what you've read after finishing it. <br />I would recommend this book to everyone no matter what your reading preferences may be. It is a fast read and can be fun as a beach book, but would not be out of place as a book for class. An excellent selection.	2003-08-11
US	51101301	R1WOTIVTC1ZBXO	0060809779	146114302	Native Son	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Great Book, Not Classic Literature	Richard Wright created a daring, insigtful book when he wrote Native Son in 1940. As a black Communist sympathizer, Wright was a member of two of the most oppressed and hated groups in America, but he wrote a moving novel explaining his liberal ideas and explaining the plight of African-Americans. Using the crimes and trial of a tragic black murderer, Wright persuasively lays out his ideas about race and politics, and how society would be better off if they gave blacks a chance at the same education, jobs and housing that whites had available to them. This was a revolutionary idea at the time, but one that is slowly, but surely, gaining acceptance to this day. <br />Aside from the subject matter, which makes this book an excellent historical (seeing as the setting is now 70 years ago and hardly recognizable anymore) look at race and class relations, politics, and urban America, this is a very well written story. The main characters are diverse and interesting, the action is rapid, and the dialogue, both external and internal, is gritty and realistic. It flows well and is a quick read. It is at some points hard to read, because the action is so intense and graphic, but certainly worth the brief gruesome scenes.<br />The only reason I wouldn't give this book a five star rating and consider it a classic as many people do, is that it becomes bogged down in rhetoric in the end. The murder trial of Bigger Thomas is too long, political, and heavy handed. Of course this was the time when Wright wanted to sum everything up and present his views, but the book slowed to a crawl, he became far to abstract, and really ended the book on a down note. Fortunately this doesn't ruin the book, just makes it not as great as it could have been.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone, from the casual reader, to a 20th century historian, to someone who wants to learn more about race, politics, or class relations. It would be an excellent book report book for high school students--not too difficult but a very important and meaningful book--but also good for adult reading groups or academics. Every reader would stand to gain from reading Native Son.	2003-07-29

Now, years later, it remains very interesting and drew me into A Shropshire Lad. I was curious to see the other material Housman published and was thrilled to find that all of his work shared similar attractive qualities. His poetry is accessible to even the most novice poetry readers (like myself) and clearly expresses complicated thoughts with beatiful language. Housman's empasis on the brevity of life, death and war are not happy topics, but they are realistic and it is valuable to consider his concise thoughts. I think this book, which essentially follows the life cycle, is full of fascinating poetry that anyone will enjoy, no matter what level you wish to analyze the material. It is a terrific collection.	2003-07-18

I chose to read The River Why because I loved The Brothers K and hoped his first novel had been as well written and memorable. I was not disappointed. The River Why follows Gus Orviston, the recently graduated son of a famous fly-fisherman, who is a fishing prodigy and wants nothing more than to fish every waking hour of his day. In order to persue his passion he moves to an isolated riverside cabin in Oregon with his fishing pole Rodney and the hopes of fishing 14 hours a day, making flies and other fishing related activities 6 hours, and sleeping the remaining six. He assumes that following this plan will lead to &quot;optimum happiness,&quot; but quickly realizes it isn't fulfilling. He wants to interact with other people, enjoy his surrounds apart for more than its fishing potential, and falls in love. It is an excellent coming of age/finding a personal religion story.<br />Besides the main story line, however, the book is excellent for several other reasons. The first is that it has a great supporting cast. Bill Bob, Gus's younger brother, in particular is one of the best child character in any novel I've read, and the rest of his family and neighbors are also developed well. They have great personalities, quirks, and are both insightful and humorous. Duncan also does a tremendous job bringing the environment to life. His descriptions bring the rivers and hills to life and allow the reader to imagine the beauty of the area. It is also a very funny book, so it flies by and is very enjoyable to read. <br />The River Why isn't a perfect book. Duncan's politics seeped in a little too much in a few instances, which would have been fine except Gus lives in an isolated world with problems to worry about other than the government and it just seems out of place when the Vietnam draft and war come up. The conclusion of the book is also disappointing after Gus marries--there are just too many unnecessary changes in his life. Thateing said, however, these small complaintsdon't hurt the book's overall impact and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in fishing, the environment, the Northwest, philosophy, or simply great writing. It can be enjoyed by people of all ages and all readers will come away with something new.	2003-07-18

The story does not focus on a loveable hunchback who finds happiness in the end, rather it is about the cathedral itself. The action and characters all feed off of Notre Dame and represent its values, but they are merely secondary aspects of the book. It is also a violent, depressing, and sometimes even erotic book, none of which of course comes through in a Disney movie. <br />Many things make this book an incredible read. The most obvious is the incredible prose. Hugo was a beautiful writer and his writing flows so smoothly. He also described with incredible detail the Paris of the late 15th century--the city's skyline, its culture, some of the notable people, and the issues of the day. He spent three years researching the book and he turned his noted into an historical epic. Finally, the action and characters of the book are well developed, exciting, and unique while still representing the values and controversies Hugo wanted to explore. <br />I originally picked this book up when I was in the 7th grade and was unable to make it more than 20 pages without giving up in frustration, but having more knowlegde of European history, a greater appreciation for literature, and more patience with a book that admittedly starts slowly, I am very glad I came back to it. I don't think this is a book that a young reader will find interesting--though the story itself is great so an abridged version would keep them reading--but any fan of great literature, beautiful prose, French history, architecture, or Victor Hugo will love this book if they give it a chance and do sit patiently while it revs up for 30-40 pages. I highly recommend it.	2003-07-03

The setting is the Atlantic Ocean several hundred miles off the Eastern Seaboard where three Fall storms converge to create one catastrphic &quot;perfect storm.&quot; Several ships, mostly deep sea fishing vessles, are caught without warning and are forced to ride it out. The action is intense as howling winds and enormous waves break boats apart and the Coast Guard and other ships race to save the crews of boats that cannot handle the conditions. It is an excellent adventure story, on par with Into Thin Air or any story about The Endurance. Junger, however, also does a superb job explaining the technical details of deep sea fishing, Coast Guard rescues, and the science behind weather systems and waves. Though I was unfamiliar with each of those topics, I was never confused because he is very clear and uses layman terms to describe complicated topics. It added wonderful some intriguing lessons to what was already very a good book. I would recommend &quot;A Perfect Storm&quot; to anyone who likes a well written, fast paced, adventure story. It can be read and appreciated by people of all ages and should be read by anyone who has seen the movie so they can learn about the whole story, rather than one small part of it.	2003-06-26

His commercial ventures never worked out as planned, either a storm or mutiny ending them before returning to England, but each time he had the good fortune of landing on an island unexplored by Europeans. On these islands he runs into a variety of natives--giants, 6&quot; tall people, people who reside on a flying island, and horses that take human-like Yahoos as pets. Each is an interesting and entertaining story in its own right and without reading any deeper into the story, but that is not why this book is a classic.<br />The author, Jonathan Swift, was a master of satire. As an Irishman he despised British rule and resisted it through his writing. Because criticism of the crown and Parliament was a punishable offense, Swift projected the personalities and social events of the day into fictional characters in imaginary circumstances with wonderful effect. While telling a terrific fictional story, he was able to rail against the system and really make a name for himself as a satirist.<br /><br />The one problem with reading a satire that is dated, is that many of the characters and social events about which the author wrote are obscured by the passage of time. I consider myself to be fairly well acquainted with British history and its major players, but without the assistance for excellent footnotes, I would have missed a tremendous amount in this story. It still would have been great without the footnotes, but would not have provided the same historical lesson, which is why I would recommend a version with a good introduction and footnotes regardless of why you are reading the story and how well you feel you know the history of Swift's era.<br />I liked this book quite a bit, though I agree with many other reviewers who think it might by a little much for younger readers. In cartoons, picture books, or movies, it can be dumbed down to a cutesy fairy tale, which is fine and will hopefully encourage children to read the real story later in life, but an unabridged version will be boring and go right over their heads. I think it is an excellent book for adults who like fantasy fiction or readers who usually like historical or political non-fiction, as it is an excellent review of Swift's times.	2003-06-16

The books proponents note that Costello writes well and provides interesting &quot;insiders&quot; perspectives of campaign politics from a secret service agent's point of view, the operations of an Internet business, and modern family life. He really does do a good job of describing the lives of the characters and weaving their narratives together. As for the naysayers, they are correct that the story has no plot and you never really care about a particular character and when the book is done, it isn't something that leaves you wanting more. I am sure this was intentional by Costello, but for my money and I think many casual readers, it is not really what they want. I will not remember Big If in a year, I do not want Costello to come out with a sequel to quinch my thirst for this story, and it isn't the first book I'll ever recommend to any friend. It was worth the short time it took to read, but it would be a better library book, one you don't have to pay for and won't take up space on your shelf for more than a month because you won't want to read it again in the future.	2003-05-30

I had not picked up one of his stories since, but upon reading that David Copperfield was Dicken's personal favorite book he had authored, I decided to try him again. I was not disappointed. Dicken's creates an incredible cast of characters and paints a vivid portrait of 19th-century England. Aside from fulfulling those crucial elements of writing a novel, Dickens tells a terrific story. The initial serialization of the story into 19 monthly parts required Dickens to create many dramatic buildups and twists and turns that kept the audience buying the next installment. When it is all put together the novel is an unexpected roller coaster that has many climbs, dives, loop-the-loops, and sharp curves. In the end everything of course comes together beautifully and the characters all get their just desserts. This is yet another clinic by Dickens in how to write a well organized, though unpredictable, novel that maintains the interest of a reader through approx. 900 pages of writing. It is a wonderful experience that all lovers of good fiction should at least attempt.	2003-05-18

It is not well written, there are obvious fabrications, and Frank Abagnale comes off as a egotistic chauvinist, but the action is quick and the tales humorous. I would never recommend this book as an educational book or for someone who only likes stories with emotions, deep plots, and well developed characters, because they aren't really present, but it was a great book to relax with and just enjoy for the day or two it takes to read. A very good book for the plane or pool.	2003-04-10

I am sorry I missed out. The length certainly makes this book easy and accessible to people of all ages, but it is so much more. Not only is it very fast paced, unpredictable, and the best character study I've ever read, but it is timeless. It is about war, specifically the Civil War, but there are no politics or specifics about that war, it is about the emotions of a youth at war and the world through his eyes. There is no difference between what he is thinking as his regiment is charging and what a 20 year old in a modern war would feel. Though Crane had never seen a war before writing this book, he paints an incredibly powerful, honest, and realistic portrayal. It is a fantastic book and one that deserves a very careful, detailed reading, but can also be enjoyed and finished in a couple hours.	2003-04-02

Being short stories, each piece can be read in one sitting, which is always convenient, but most are so good that you want to jump immediately into the next one. This is easy to do, despite the diversity of the stories and styles, because the themes are all rather similar and have a dark undertone to them. It is great to see how some of the biggest names in contemporary fiction--Stephen King, Michael Crichton, Nick Hornby, etc.--handle the short story format, especially for authors like Hornby who are writing stories unlike those which they usually produce. There were some weak stories included in the book, but they are quick and painless, so it certainly doesn't diminish much from the quality of the book as a whole....	2003-03-26

It includes some of the most well drawn characters in the history of thriller novels--Hannibal Lecter, Clarice Starling, and Jack Crawford--but Thomas Harris does nothing with them. Hannibal enjoys the good life on the outside, but jumps around trying to evade capture from either the police or Mason Verger. It is interesting for a while, but it never seems that anyone else is really on his tail or that there is enough action to keep everything moving along. Clarice is also in trouble constantly within the Bureau, but it isn't interesting and the political undertones in the story take away from the excitement it should have. This would have been bad enough, but the ending to this story is so inplausible and stupid that it would have ruined the book completely if it hadn't already been pretty much destroyed by the previous 400 pages. The only thing that makes this book worth reading is that Harris does include some good suspense and violence that keeps it interesting and making the reader want more, expecting that it will get good, even though when you reach the end, it never lives up to the high hopes. I would not recommend this book (though I would recommend Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon very highly) to anyone.	2003-03-18

Roth is a wonderful writer, he uses a passionate vocabulary and creates wonderful characters and in this book writes an engaging story into which the reader is drawn. It follows the hidden failures and internal stuggles of a man who had everything and by all accounts was happy and successful. His life, however, had fallen apart after his formerly wonderful daughter bombed a local store and killed a man. Watching him crumble and have to confront his deamons is fascinating. It is a wonderful novel and I cannot recommend it enough to any fan of fiction who has enough time to read an excellent book carefully.	2003-03-09

Though Biko died young and apartheid has faded into memories for most people who had the misfortune of living in it, his is an excellent example of the horroific prejudices to which people, even in these enlightened times, can be subjected. This book uses incredible detail and many essential sources to tell a lively, powerful, and important story. I watched Cry Freedom several years ago and was inspired tolearn more about the subject, and I would recommend the same path, because the movie really brings the characters and issues to life. I would caution people who only want to learn the basics about the history of apartheid or Biko, that this is a very indepth and detailed book, that can be difficult to follow if you are not familiar with the subjects, so I might recommend a slightly more elementary book for a first experience.	2003-02-23

It combines some of the best features of a group of my favorite novels--A Prayer from Owen Meany (the subject matter, interesting chracters, wonderful anecdotes and twists throughout the story), Catcher in the Rye (introspective chracters looking for their way in the world and inviting the reader to join the adventure), and A River Runs Through It (the gorgeous scenery, sports and religion, and again fantastic characters). It is a long novel, but don't let that frighten you because it reads quickly and will engage you for all 640 pages and leave you wanting to learn more about the lives of the Chance family, even after following them for 30 years. As a reader you become involved in all of their lives, your emotions become tied up in their successes and failures, and they seem like real people you have known your entire life. I could ask for nothing more from a novel about a family. The books also contains excellent dialogue, a diverse and engaging set of tagents, and subtely addresses several debates (Vietnam, religion, abortion, etc.) that have dominated the past 40 years--it will keep you thinking. I can not recommend this book highly enough, I loved it, and even if you do not like baseball, religion, or politics, around which the story revolves, you will like this book.	2003-02-13

John Keegan succeeds brilliantly. As an expert on World War II, Keegan has written many wonderful and insightful books and this is no exception despite the literary constraints placed upon him. His clear and beautiful prose make the book a quick and enjoyable read, but he does not sacrifice information. I did not know a lot about Churchill before reading this book, but now I feel that I have a good understanding for his achievements and why he was so significant in his own time. It is a fabulous book for an amateur historian who does not want to spend dozens of hours wading through a biography several volumes long and simply wants to know significant events and some good analysis by a renowned historian.

Those are all excellent qualities that I love in a book, but sadly this story also just never really moves. The characters aren't particularly engaging, even Sebastian Dangerfield who is the focus of all the action in the story. He is certainly infuriating as a lazy, abusive, self centered, morally corrupt person, which is not a problem for me since some of the best chracters in fiction share these qualities, but I don't care about his flaws or the people who he manipulates and disregards throughout the book. The book is not particularly memorable and never made me stop and think or particularly care what it was saying, so as I see it the book fails in the end. Many critics and well respected authors love this book, who I assume appreciate its unique (for the 1950's at least) free-flowing style and graphic depictions of various types of debauchery, but as a casual reader it was no better than average.	2003-01-24

His economic system was innovative and certainly helped modernize the economy of France, but his greed and that of the rest of the country led to the downfall of the system. The story of France's economy itself was an interesting story, but the story of Law's life is equally interesting.

Irving, while taking a break from writing novels, decided to pen a short autobiography, but he brought his usual sense of humor, ability to develop characters, and readable style to the project. The story does an excellent job of explaining the life events and people who have shaped his character and writing, which I think is very useful when trying to understand and appreciate his other books. I think this story itself is some of Irving's best writing and is certainly worth the short time it takes to read. I would recommend, however, instead of paying for the memoir alone, you purchase Trying to Save Piggy Sneed which includes this memoir as well as several short stories. You will not be disappointed if you are an Irving fan or just enjoy good, entertaining writing.	2003-01-05

I think that is because those of us who are from that region recognize the truth of this novel for the people who make their living logging, farming, and fishing in the rough and tumble rural regions. The book is filled with real characters who have real life sturggles and search for some meaning in thier endeavours. The Stampers, the old time logging family who has built a business from nothing and &quot;Never give an inch&quot; are the types of people imagine by most Western idealists--they are hard working, rugged individualists. They do their job the best the can without complaining and don't care about getting help from anyone else. It is a terrific story. What Kesey also does well is create passion--for the characters, their work, and their lifestyles. He writes with a sense of urgency, and though his writing can meander and wander, it always comes back to the heart of the matter. <BR>  Sometimes a Great Notion is a terrific novel and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the Northwest a little better, likes great writing, and enjoys American sociology, because this book certainly provides insights into the logging society. I can not recommend it highly enough.	2003-01-05

Picking up on Huxley's argument about making people passive by giving them exactly what they want, Postman feels that television keeps people happy and but changes the way people communicate and makes people less apt to challenge ideas and really search for meaning. Instead they are taught to accept things on face value and to choose politicians and ideas that look best within the unique confines of television entertainment. It is a fascinating book and has a very well written, comprehensible argument. Anyone interesting in communications, history, or modern sociology will appreciate this book and enjoy it thoroughly.	2002-12-15

Friedman of course writes very well and his articles are thought provoking, which I appreciate even though I don't always agree with him, but the bst parts of this book is he explores not only the American reaction to the terrorist attacks, but those in the Middle East and Europe.

Unfortunately, it is also a very difficult book to read because of the confusion caused by repetitive names, the reality mixed with fable style of the narrative, and the pace of the novel which jumps around constantly. This poses a problem for someone like myself who often likes to read on the bus or just for a few minutes before I go to sleep--I could not get in a ryhthm and would forget important details so the book did not always make sense. When I had time to concentrate it was beautifully written, intense, and interesting, so I would highly recommend it for someone with the time to really delve into and read it in long stretches. For people who like to read great literature but don't have much time to devote to this book, I would recommend you come back to this one later when you can devote yourself to it.	2002-12-01

The book advertises itself as containing the &quot;best&quot; sports writing of the century and for the most past I would certainly agree, and disagreement has to be expected when you declare something the best, so it is great reading. It is fine journalism, telling captivating stories about people and games, but it is also does an excellent job of showing the importance of sports beyond the fields of play. I would highly recommend the book to sports loves, aspiring journalists, and I would also recommend many of the pieces for people who cannot understand why sports lovers really love sports.	2002-11-29

Unlike training guides or running stories that spend far too much time explaining the beauty of running and trying to introduce people to the wonders of jogging around, Once A Runner really goes into the life and mind of a runner (though the book uses fictional characters, they are easily recognizable and realistic). It describes the dedication, hard work, and goofiness that is required to be successful and what makes runners a very unique, though cetainly interesting breed. The story itself, of a young college-aged runner and his quest to run the fastest mile he could while in school and after he got kicked out, is extremely well paced and smootly written, just as a good race. It is a fantastic book and I would highly recommend it for beginners, enthusiasts, or someone who just needs a little motivation.	2002-11-25

It is well written, has good characters, and explores some interesting cultural topics (high school sports, failing mill towns, youths in America, etc.). Fall River is one of the poorest towns in Massachusetts, but its one saving grace in the early 1990's was its successful basketball team. Life in the town revolved around the team, which provided some hope to some but certainly had negative consequences for many of the athletes and possibly the future of the city. It is a very similar tale to Friday Night Lights, which is probably the best sports book I have read, but is different enough that it is well worth reading. It is also fascinating to read about Chris Herren, who happens to be a classic example of a troubled athlete, before he he made headlines in college and joined the NBA. I really appreciated the focus on the town and the people rather than the actual games, which often dominates books of this genre and just distract from the compelling parts of the book. My only complaints about the book are that it wasn't particularly well edited (I caught several spelling errors that are particularly obnoxious in a mass punlished book, though really don't spoil the story in the slightest) and that it is not quite as detailed as it could have been considering the level of access Reynolds had to the kids and coaches. I would highly recommend this story to anyone and particularly sports fans or people who liked Friday Night Lights.	2002-11-08

The research Slotkin did about many of the often ignored events in Lincoln's formative years and the inclusion of some obscure celebrities of the 1830's is impressive, but attempts to connect the two are ridiculous. There is simply no reason to make up a fictional story about Lincoln's upbringing to make it interesting, unusual, and important to his political beliefs. It is thrown together haphazardly and Slotkin's attempts to occasionally use the vernacular (without rhyme or reason all of the characters and even the narrator go in and out of their unique dialects)do not help the story flow or add anything to the novel. Basically it seems that Slotkin is trying to take elements from Huck Finn, Uncle Tom's Cabin, and The Bible, stir them up and add a little sexual scandal to sell a book. It does not work and really makes for a disappointing read. I think historical novels about famous leaders are great, but there should be a thesis the author goes on to prove in it and the later part of that equation is sorely lacking here--Slotkin wants to show that Lincoln's trip down the Mississippi influenced Lincoln's future politics, but he never really demonstrates it even though he was free to make up any dialogue and events he liked in order to do it. Slotkin tried to do many things with this book, and I appreciate the effort, but it just does not work and going against the general feeling of most reviewers on Amazon, I cannot recommend this to anyone unless it all you have available to read.	2002-10-18

He uses language beautifully, develops characters extremely well, and creates good drama. I would, however, say that he is a better essayist than novelist and I would recommend The Right Stuff or The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test over this book because they are more focussed and he keeps his story together better in them. With that said though, I would highly recommend Bonfire of the Vanities. Wolfe describes the socialites, lowlifes, politicians, reporters, and other various characters who populate the New York scene and all of their particular vanities in great detail. They are believable, whether they are likable or not is really besides the point, and they come to life with their authentic dialogue and charater flaws. It is a satirical book written by a very observant author, so even those who have not been exposed to this culture is able to become caught up in it and find themselves fascinated by the whole scene. I would recommend this book to anyone who like social critiques, interesting characters, good writing, and a fast paced story.	2002-10-03

McCourt's rich and colorful stories about his life, presented in descriptive, simple, and direct language are always interesting and certainly eye opening to anyone fortunate enough not to grow up in the slums of New York and Limmerick. This story, which spans from the late 19040's until the mid-1980's, provides an excellent portarait of the cultural changes that took place in New York city during the time and the experience of a young immigrant's growth during this era. It isn't just a history though, it is a beautifully written and fascinating study of one man's life--his troubles and triumphs--that will absorb any reader. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who wants to read a good book and is not afraid to get caught up in someone else's life.	2002-09-27

How could you not want to chop parsley while listening to jazz, shovel snow with Buddah, or flip through a Victoria's Secret catalog when he makes it all sound so exotic and wonderful. I am not a huge fan of poetry and I seldom take the time to analyze it deeply, but Collins is the finest and most interesting contemporary poet I know of and would highly recommend his poetry to anyone who likes a good laugh, creative use of language, and something to make them think. This is an excellent collection I am glad was recommended to me and I would certainly urge everyone I know to get at least a taste of Collins.	2002-09-25

His stories are creative, compassionate, well written, and meaningful, which of course isn't nearly as important to young readers as the fact that they are just plain fun. Danny the Champion of the World is the story of a young boy and his widower father trying to poach pheasants from a local aristocrat's property. Their appoach is creative and their adventure is exciting, but their relationship is also touching and very effective. It is very easy book and enjoyable for children, and for adults who know how nice a realtionship with children like the one Danny and his father share, it is a touching story. This book is meant to be read aloud, but it is a wonderful story for anyone to read to themselves as well.	2002-09-24

Buckley, a recent graduate of Yale University at the time he wrote his book, feared that the mission of the university was being ignored in the name of academic honesty without the knowledge or approval of the alumni who give the Corporation the money it needs to operate. Yale's historical goal was to prepare men to be good Christians and American citizens, religious &quot;individualists&quot; in Buckley's terms, but he felt that professors with personal beliefs opposed to these ideas were diverting students from the path they and their parents were promised by the school's mission statement. It is a provacative argument whether you agree with it or not and is well worth exploring just to think a little deeper about higher education in America. The book is dated and the ample evidence Buckley used to prove his case is now rather meaningless to the contemporary reader, but it is still worth reading. I think most people interested in higher education will find the argument interesting even if they think it is ridiculous and it is well written and easy to understand so it is a good way to get your mind working.	2002-09-24

Massie, who is one of the most readable historians I've ever come across, incorporates incredible research and a flair for storytelling to make this both academic and exciting. I began reading the book hoping to learn more about Russia and Peter the Great, but Massie is much more ambitious than that and describes the socio-political climate throughout Europe during Peter's era. It provides a wonderful history lesson and is certainly as thorough as most semester long European history classes. I cannot recommend this book enough to anyone interested in history or enjoys exciting stories about heroic emperors, wars, politics, and foreign cultures. Do not let the length scare you off, this will be one of the best historical books you ever read.	2002-09-18

Though it is now a little dated (it was about the '96 election) and focuses a little too much on the unlikely third party candidate Morry Taylor, it is a very honest portrayal of the mess that is presidential campaigning. Lewis was obviously not very experienced with the campaign trail and uses his sharp wit to highlight its unique and baffling characteristics (waving to no one from a plane stair case, having debates in front of now studio audience). It has great characters and Lewis does an excellent job of describing them, nd showing why it is so easy to fall for third party candidates and why they will never win. It is great political commentary and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes politics, Michael Lewis books, or just an interesting, easy book about current events.	2002-09-07

On<BR>the other hand, even giving it only half my attention, the book was still entertaining. Ahab's obsession, the action on the high sea, and the battle with whales were all intriguing and griping. I also learned a tremendous amount about the whaling industry and lifeon the sea in the 19th century. There is tremendous depth to this book, but even if you only scratch the surface it is worth the time and effort to do so once. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who does not like 18th century literature (it can be<BR>extremely wordy and dull at times), but for anyone who has an interest in maritime novels, Melville, or is just curious why thereis so much talk about Moby Dick, I would advise you to give it a chance.	2002-09-07

Like most mafia based entertainment, it gets your attention and has some kind of strange &quot;tough-guy&quot; appeal. It does a good job of detailing Gotti's life and the organization of the Gambino family, which is really all I asked for from the book. It is not, however, particularly well written or convincing. It reads a lot like a 450 page New York Daily News police report, which is good in that it has the facts, but gets a little dry after a while. To spice things up, the authors obviously had to rely on a lot of heresay and innuendo to fill out the details they could not have possibly gotten first hand, which gives it a little bit of a false feeling. This is the best and most accurate source I have about the Cosa Nostra, however, so I think it valuable for that reason. If you are interested in the mafia or Gotti, this is a good book, but if you are not already interested in the subjects, this book certainly won't demonstrate their appeal.	2002-09-07

It is not particularly well written, but like any good serial novel it has a fair amount of suspense that makes it hard to put down. The story of the convicted killer who proves to have incredible healing powers and a great heart is compelling and memorable, and something you can fully appreciate after a very superficial read. It is not great literature, but it is certainly entertaining and pleasant for the short time it takes to read. I would recommend it to someone who has some time to kill and wants a feel good book to keep them company.	2002-09-07

I was well rewarded for doing so. It a simple book about some rather &quot;simple&quot; people who live rather extraordinary lives. Buck spent her youth amongst Chinese peasants and in this novel captured their lives--the struggles, triumphs, and everything in between--quite vividly. She also does an excellent job of describing the emotions of the characters she develops in the story. This is an excellent primer on the lives of common Chinese peasants in the early 1900's and is extremely readable. I would recommend it to anyone of any age who wants a good, quick, and enlightening read.	2002-09-07

He interviewed hundreds, if not thousands, of people who had lived through the Soviet regime and who played some role, regarldless of how small and seemingly insignificant, in the transformation of the nation, and this research paid huge dividends. He combines all these personal stories into one great book that explains and analyzes why and how this happened. It is very well written, and while being comprehensive remains comprehensible. It is a wonderful book and anyone who is interested in Russia (or would like to become so), likes history in general, or enjoys good semi-academic writing this book is for you.	2002-09-07

This is an extremely well written, exciting, fast paced novel that takes place during the early days of space flight and focuses on the personalities who drove our pursuit to beat the Russians. It contains subtle criticism of the space program and the people inside it, which is a nice subplot to the story, but the adventure and energy is what makes this a great book. I will again read Wolfe and want to learn more about the history of the space program now, and when a book inspires these kind of reactions I can not help but recommend it to anyone who asks for a suggestion.	2002-09-07

They quieted down and listened intently for as long as I would read and after each mystery would excitedly participate in a discussion about the solution. It also inspired several of them to start reading their own books or to ask me to borrow some of mine. These are very fun stories, well written, and have tremendous appeal for kids.

Rhodes begins his project in the formative years of the atomic age and follows the development of the science through the dropping of the bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the conclusion of World War II. Throughtout this period, however, he also explores the politics, culture, and personalities that surrounded the project and made it possible. The book alone is a top notch historical examination of the era, but it is also scientific enough that it could qualify as a supplementary text for a physics course. Rhodes is a terrific author and makes the very complicated scientifc details clear even to the most ignorant reader, but more importantly he is able to help the reader understand the moral and political crises all of the scientists and military personnel had with the Manhattan Project. It is an unbelievably ambitious book, but is very easy to read and understand. I would recommend this to anyone interested in atomic physics, the history or the bomb, world politics, or who just wants to read an interesting non-fiction book on a very important topic.	2002-03-03

Toole does an excellent job of decribing the gritty, intense, and certainly brutal boxing life in each of the six short stories contained in this volume, but he doesn't really examine anything new. The stories tend to have fairly bland characters and involve recycled plots, but this is tolerable because the writing is excellent. While I was never on the edge of my seat because the stories were relatively predictable, I did not want to put the book down and was eager to start the next story as soon as I finished one. This isn't what I would call great literature, but I would recommend it to boxing fans or anyone who was a Rocky fan, Rope Burns is right up your alley.	2002-03-03

He is not a particularly good writer and his anecdotes often fall flat because he does a poor job of explaining the story. Another problem is that he relies on very few sources, so his book is terribly biased and its stories are limited. For instance, Menzer relies on Billy Packer to essentially tell Wake Forest's story. While Packer is amusing, he is arrogant and is only one person so Wake's history is not three dimensional at all and really doesn't seem particularly interesting. Despite these flaws, which would prevent me from recommending this book to anyone who doesn't love college basketball and particularly the Carolina schools, this book is a good companion for a fan and will give them some interesting historical context that will allow them to appreciate their team that much more. Also, it will provide some nice trivia for those who like to bring up obscure facts during arguments about who is the best player, team, coach, etc. in the history of these programs.	2002-03-03

I will grant that the characters are not particularly well developed and you don't really care about any one, especially the women who all seem to be made from the same mold, but otherwise it is well done. The plot is interesting, the writing is superb, it is a very fast-paced read, and in the end the reader is left with a warm heart. The comic element is as prevalent as in any of Irving's book and it it incorproates many contemporary events which makes it all the more immediate to readers, so I do not agree with many reviers that it is not interesting enough for them. I think this is a great book for any one who has experience with Irving, loves good fiction, and is looking for a fun, relatively easy read.	2002-03-03

The book is set in the frenzied 1980's when bond traders were raking in millions of dollars a year and were at the top of the investment banking-heap. It is a wild world where unbelieveably confident, ambitious, and greedy men put their all (their money, time, and energy--all of which they have in large reserves)into making more money than anyone else in their firm and any other firm on Wall Street. Lewis is always funny and a very careful observer of the world which he describes, so this is a wonderful insider's perspective of a fascinating career. It really makes investment banking come alive, does a wonderful job explaining complicated financial matter, and though it is non-fiction all of the outlandish characters make it a very entertaining read. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in finance or who just want to read a very well written, fun book about &quot;the real world.&quot;	2002-03-02

It is a wonderful fairy tale with great characters and a very well crafted plot, but what I enjoyed most was that it was so accessible. It is written for younger children, so it is very easy to sit down for a few hours and just enjoy what you are reading without having to think too deeply or strain your brain while trying to follow the story.

Throughout the novel, Hornby examines how the significant events and relationships in his life relate directly to Arsenal games he has attended. He attends his first game with his father shortly after his parents divorced, he knew he was in love the first time when he was able to share his team with a woman, and he buys season tickets at the same time his life starts settling down in his twenties. It is a very funny book and I learned a lot about soccer and obsession, but it also made me feel okay about my own personal obsessive tendencies, which pale in comparison to those of the main character. It isn't a difficult or long read so I would suggest it to anyone who just wants to read an enjoyable book, even if they don't care a bit about soccer.	2001-12-30

It has all the elements of an excellent novel-a good plot, well-developed characters, excellent writing-but for runners it will seem much more like a biography of one of their own. Quenton, the hero of the story, and his fellow runners are all intense, focused, quirky, unique people who any runner can easily recognize and relate to from their own lives. These characters struggle to endure the \\"Trial of Miles\\" necessary to compete on the top level and throughout the book wonder if and why this sacrifice is worth it. These are questions all athletes ask themselves from time to time, and through Quenton, John L. Parker does an excellent job of explaining the answers he has found. The book draws you in immediately and, just as a good race does, gets more exciting as it moves along so that I never wanted to put it down. This is a very inspirational book, an excellent read, and reminded me why running is such an amazing sport. Once a Runner is a must-read for any serious runner and would be a wonderful story for anyone who either wants to understand why people run or may need a little motivation to start doing so themselves.	2001-12-30

For one year, Bob Knight allowed John Feinstein unbelievable access to his practices, games, locker room talks, private meals, and all other facets of his life, and the author did a wonderful job putting all of his evidence together to describe the maniacal coach and the world of top-level college basketball. Coach Knight is a character who could not be imagined by a novelist because he is too complex. Throughout the book he proves to be one of the most loving, hating, bullying, charming, objectionable, and compassionate men you have ever encountered. His personality alone is a fascinating story and Feinstein does an excellent job of presenting all sides of the story to readers, but the story also includes the players, coaches, university officials, friends, and enemies who live within Knight's sphere, and each of them adds their unique and interesting perspective to the book. By focusing on the ups and downs of the 1985-86 Indiana University basketball season, Feinstein is able to put all of these people into context and makes an excellent drama out of what is on the surface little more than a sports biography. This is a great book about a brilliant coach and no true college basketball fan should miss the chance to read it.	2001-12-30

As with all good biographies, it describes the significant events in his life and relates several anecdotes that help make him seem more alive to the contemporary reader, but what it does particularly well is describe America and Washington's influence upon the national character. This is a difficult task because during Washington's lifetime America transformed itself from a collection of individual colonies into a confederation that revolted against its mother country and finally into a unified nation. America was in a constant state of upheaval and Washington oversaw and directed its entire evolution. Flexner's ability to not only guide the reader through Washington's life, but also to show the impact of his actions, is what sets this book apart from most biographies of Washington I have read and is why I would highly recommend it to all who have an interest in colonial history or politics or simply want to learn more about this \\"Indispensable Man.\\"	2001-12-26

Robert Gross did a tremendous amount of research to find information about individuals whose names and accomplishments have long since been forgotten by the world, but he tells their story so thoroughly that he allows the reader to forget what a challenging task he took upon himself. In this book, which was published shortly after the Vietnam War and without ever mentioning that conflict highlights some interesting parallels between it and the American Revolution, Gross asks the reader to question why these colonists, who were content to oversee local affairs and leave even the most important colonial and national matters to outsiders, would get caught up in the American Revolution, and the book provides some interesting answers. This book takes a refreshing look at colonial America and provides its readers with incredible data from the period; it will certainly benefit all scholars and mere colonial history buffs.	2001-12-26

Salter is a very good writer, his prose are excellent, but the subject matter was repetitive and dull. His discussion of his youth, days at West Point, and early career as a fighter pilot is engaging and make for a great book. Unfortunately that only fills half the book and from there Salter wanders aimlessly describing the various friends he made and what he was doing from day to day in his thirties and forties. His anecdotes about his military service lose their vitality and then after he is discharged from the army his life becomes dull. The final chapters of the book read like a social register in which hundreds of notable people are mentioned, but none really add anything substantial to the overall story. Salter has certainly lived an interesting life, but it was not worth my time or money to read about it here.	2001-09-06

Imagine that, a celebrity who had something to hide--this is no surprise and is a poor way to market this book. While Cramer does include some seamy details about DiMaggio's personal life, most of the story is about the creation of his myth. Cramer obviously admires his subject and thought very highly of him, but I suppose in a tabloid era, gossip sells. This biography is very well written and extensively researched, so if you do not know much about Joltin' Joe, this is an excellent place to learn and I am sure it will leave you in awe of his presence on the field. There was a lot of relatively unsubstantiated claims about DiMaggio and many of his associates which detract from the story and make the author seem less than professional, but all in all this is a wonderful book and I would highly recommend it to any sports fan or someone interested in DiMaggio.	2001-09-03

It focuses on street basketball, but also highlights basketball in places such as small town Indiana, an Indian reservation, and resort towns of the 1920's-40's. It is more about the culture surrounding basketball and its importance to various communities. There are a lot of wonderful anecdotes and legends included in the story, but they are only minor details in a much larger portrait. The book is not particularly well organized and the writing itself was poor, but it is obvious that extensive research went into it and the subject is very interesting, so I would recommend it on those merits alone.	2001-08-16
US	51101301	RAYU8CW7NONNJ	0915297086	707763396	The Olympian	Books	3	8	8	N	N	Interesting story, poor presentation	Brian Glanville's novel about a young miler who rises from obscurity to become a world record holder, is both a good story and a difficult read. The book details Ike Low's running career from the time he is discovered by infamous British coach Sam Dee until the 1964 Olympics final six years later. Low's whole life revolves around running and training, and this becomes a problem when it comsumes his romances, emotional state, and general view of the world. He has a classic one track mind which does considerable harm to everyone around him. It is a very interesting story, particularly for serious runners who may be able to relate to his training and lifestyle, but it was a difficult one to read because Glanville is simply not the best writer out there. He tries to use three separate narrators to tell the story which is very confusing, particularly because they do not have distinct voices, rather they sounds the same and it often takes a while to realize whose viewpoint you are hearing at the time. Also, the charater development is not very good--you know enough about the characters, but they never seem to really become much more than two dimensional actors. It is a good book to add to a running library, but really not one that I would purchase for any other reason, including pleasure reading.	2001-08-13

The Fight paints beautiful portraits of many of the characters, events, and locations that surrounded The Rumbe in The Jungle of 1975. His eye for detail and incredible descriptive ability made this a wonderful read. More important to boxing fans, however, is that his actual recount of the fight itself may be the single best piece of boxing writing I have ever read--it was better than watching the real thing and Mailer somehow makes the reader feel like he is both a ringside spectator and one of the combatants at the same time (a strange experience, but certainly one worth having). This book is an excellent companion to When We Were Kings and the actual video of the fight, both of which are sold by Amazon. Another interesting contrast is provided by David Remnick's King of the World, which details the months leading up to Ali's first championship fight against Sonny Liston. Ali evolved a great deal between 1964 when he was still a young, scared Cassius Clay and 1975 when he had become an older, wiser, though no less enthusiastic champion. The Fight is a great book, a must have for all boxing fans and certainly worthy of any reader who enjoys excellent character development, action, and terrific writing.	2001-08-09

It tells the story of an orthopedic surgeon who is trying to decide where he truly fits in (he was born in Bombay, educated in Europe, and permanently settled in Toronto), while dealing with numerous exotic characters and unique situations. Irving paints a beautiful picture of India and it is as well crafted and intriguing as any of Irving's books. It is a little more difficult to relate to and get into then A Prayer For Owen Meany or Garp, so I would recommend reading either or both of those books before trying this one, but it is a wonderful story, so once you are accustomed to the Irving style this is a book you should not miss. I would certainly recommend it to all Irving lovers or anyone simply interested in a good book.	2001-08-07

I learned a fair amount about the savings and loan scandals, leveraged buy outs, and the Japanese economic miracle and collapse, and also enjoyed some amusing tales of financial excess, but I had to read through a lot of less than interesting pages to find those treasures. I would not recommend someone buy this book, but if you can find it in the library, it is certainly worth flipping through it.	2001-07-24

This book about the Corleone Family, really defines the mafia genre and has not been equalled in the 32 years since it was written. The character development is phenomenal, the story lines are very well woven together and conceived, and the ethical lessons contained within the text are sometimes complex, but fascinating.  It shocks me how little Coppola had to alter the story or the characters to create his masterpiece and it will be apparent to all who read it, Mario Puzo's Godfather, is a classic in its own right. You will be disappointed when the story is over, because you are so caught up in the lives of the Corleones that you just want to follow them further. I really can not say enough about this book, but I would recommend it to everyone.	2001-07-22

It is at times laugh out loud funny, poignant, and a wonderfully introspective piece of writing, but it can also be pretty annoying. Throughout, Eggers wants to remain casual, fun loving, and humorous, but sometimes, it is obvious that he is trying too hard and it really detracts from the book. On the other hand, there are enough very good passages to make you want to keep reading and willing to endure the dull sections. It is a very interesting story about the death of his parents, relationship with his friends and siblings, and his attempt to start a magazine, and I certainly came out liking and caring about the characters, which was probably one of his main objectives in writing the story the way he does. I think anyone prepared for a well written, though certainly uniquely organized, book that will make them laugh and think about the consequences of being a twenty year old orphan will like the book. I would caution, however, that it is a stereotypical Gen-X type book, in that it moves at the pace of MTV, sometimes ignores deep feelings and thinking, and tries to be &quot;different&quot; than what has previously been written. All of that being said, however, I would definitely recommend it for someone in the market for a good, contemporary memoir.	2001-07-16

It is the story of a pitiable man, Dominick Birdsey, and his life and relationships with all of the characters who surround him-a schizophrenic brother, abusive step-father, insightful mental health workers, an ex-wife, sleazy car-salesman/best friend, and others. Most of the story has Dominic fighting for his twin brother, who is institutionalized and can not fend for himself, despite his inner turmoil and anger about the circumstances in which he was raised. The book is very contemporary, has wonderfully created &quot;real&quot; characters, and anyone can relate to the people and the situations in this novel. It is very readable despite the length, and while I was disappointed in the last 35 pages, as a good book turned into a neatly sewn up fairy tale, I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in reading a very revealing book that will make them think a lot about themselves, their relationships, and what they are doing with their lives (don't worry it is not a self-help book by any means, these are merely byproducts of the story).	2001-07-13

Rivlin, while an obvious admirer of the technology tycoons, presents a fairly unbiased (though tilting a little in favor of Bill Gates) story about the growth of Microsoft, the computer industry in general, and the ever growing group of anti-Microsoft competitors. It does a very good job of describing all the players in this game, following the industry for the past twenty years, and explaining the technology so even computer illiterates like myself can understand. Rivlin obviously did a tremendous amount of research, interviewed hundreds of technologists, and really put his findings together well. This book is well written (though the flow is sometimes interrupted when Rivlin seems to remember something he forgot to add earlier and makes a long tangent out of it), very interesting (though nothing terribly original is presented if you are well acquainted with the technology industry), and entertaining. I would highly recommend it for people who want to learn more about Gates, other technology tycoons, the technology industry, or just want a look at how competitive companies operate and interact.	2001-07-08

That aspect of the book bothers me though, because it sometimes becomes such a glowing portrait of the company that the story can not be taken at face value... That being said, I think Katz's unprecedented access to Phil Knight and many of Nike's other top executives and athletes allows him to tell the story of Nike's growth and continuous battle for market share from a unique perspective. I have also read Swoosh, cowritten by the wife of a former Nike executive, and it tells a similar tale, but is so biased against Nike that it's analysis is even less believable then Katz'z. I think this is an interesting portrait of a great American company and has an insider perpective you will not find else where, but I only give it three stars because it is a bit of a PR job and is surely not as even handed as I would like.	2001-07-05

When I was younger, I loved the book but was too caught up by the foul language, prostitues, and poor manners of most of the characters (if those bother you, it is not a good book for you), but now that I am a bit desensitized by those aspects of the book, I understand how well Salinger captures the alienation of teenagers. I found myself relating to Holden Caufield, his cynicism, frustration with the world in which he is stuck, and the desire just to leave everything behind because certainly the grass is greener on the other side. Everyone can relate to this if they allow themselves to remember just how topsy turvy-adolescense can be. The story itself has many incredible moments and some excellent characters, but I will admit that it slows down occasionally and sometimes does not flow well, but I am willing to accept those aspects of the book because they  help remind the reader of Holden's alienation and the story remains incredibly enriching and still causes a healthy does of self-reflection. I liked this book a lot and will assure any teen or someone who wants to reminisce about their youth, that it is a terrific book for you.	2001-06-28

In Cosmos, Sagan takes the readers through the history, present (as of 1980), and future of astronomy. In under 300 pages, he summarized all that I learned in a semester long astronomy class and much more, all in clear, concise, and interesting prose. He asks and answers many questions I have had about the universe beyond Earth, and proposes many theories and scenarios that he wishes he knew more about. He writes in a way that every reader can understand, even when the subject is a terribly complex problem that only the greatest astronomers have dared to tackle. This trait as well as his own curiosity, make the reader feel comfortable and assured even if they will never be more than hopelessly amatuer astronomers. Aside from the broad exploration of the Cosmos, Sagan makes interesting cases for the advancement of knoledge and peace on Earth and takes fascinating tangents  that are very thought provoking. This is the best science book I have ever read and while I will never be much of a scientist, it makes me jealous of those who are.	2001-06-28

This book follows Jim Clark, founder of Netscape and two other billion dollar companies, as he attempts to build the world's largest sail boat and to secure capital for his new companies which have never made a profit and have no prospect of doing so in the near future. It was a very timely piece when it was written, in the midst of the Internet boom, but as that period has passed us by, the immediacy opf the story has as well. I don't think this would be a bad thing, because I love historical non-fiction and the economy fascinates me, but Jim Clark and the rest of the cast who populate this story are not very interesting characters and the story is not very intriguing. I think this book provides good lessons about overexuberance, but aside from that it is not a book I would recommend to my friends or would ever pick up again.This is a quick read and provides an interesting picture of how the ecnonmy worked in the late 90's, but it did not leave a memorable impression.	2001-06-27

Capote's style, language, and pacing was amongst the best I have ever experienced. If for no other reason than to read exquisite writing, this is an excellent book. As a bonus to readers, however, this book also contains a chilling, though engrossing true-story, of two men who murdered four of Kansas' finest citizens. I love programs such as Law and Order that profile the police work and courtroom drama that follow a crime, so this was right up my alley. Capote recreates the lives and actions of everyone involved in these crimes (sometimes it is obvious that some details were fictionalized as no survivors could have actually testified to them) and makes everyone compelling, including the two murderers. It is a fantastic book and one that I would recommend to anyone interested in fine literature, human psychology, true crime, or just a quick, unforgettable read.	2001-06-25

I was originally assigned to read this book over the summer before eigth grade and thought it was a terrifically fun story about a young boy on an adventure down the Mississippi River, but now several years later I can still relate to it, but on a new level. This book contains fabulous social satire, excellent use of the vernacular, wonderful characters such as the Duke and Dauphin, and several lessons in morality presented by a savvy young boy who doess not realize how intelligent are his instincts. Mark Twain is a marvelous author, this being only one of his fine novels and short stories, and I envy his ability to get in touch with his childhood and create such a genuine and accurate character as Huck Finn. This is a terrific book, and I feel that anyone who has not had the privilege of reading it is missing out on something wonderful.	2001-06-21

These facts gave me high hopes, and for the most part I was not disappointed. The major characters are all very well developed and have good interplays (though some of the minor characters such as the thug, Paul Kelly, should have been drawn a little more fully), the historical aspects are clever and very accurate, and the story moves along quite quickly. I am not a regular reader of mysteries, but the main characteristic I look for in them is suspence that makes me want to keep reading whenever I come to the end of a chapter (if I lack sleep because of a book it is a good sign), and this book certainly did so. In addition, as one reviewer wrote, this book rewards patience, and that is very true as there are some terrific plot twists near the end. The only problem I had with the book, were some periods when Caleb Carr addes some pointless tangents and details (a needless aside about the narrator's brother sticks out in my mind), which takes away from the action and slows the pace, but that is really a minor quibble. I would highly recommend thius book to fans of mysteries, historical fiction, or really anyone who likes a well written, quick read.	2001-06-18

It lays out very good explanations of why the mental side of running is nearly as important as the physical and what you can do to improve your concentration, overcome anxiety, and develop mental toughness, and it does so through a very readable and easily understandable text. It is slightly dated (the references to and testimonials of running stars of the past and personal no longer carry the same weight they may have in the early 1980s), but it certainly made me realize the importance of preparing myself mentally for races and training. This is not an inspirational book, but certainly a wonderful reference tool for coaches and athletes who hope to get a little more out of themselves.	2001-06-15

The descriptions and the characters are very realistic, the names and places are not very fictionalized, and it makes me feel right at home. Fortunately for those readers not privleged to live in the Inland Northwest, the stories also teach a lot about Indian culture, the modern Native American and their heritage. It is a disturbing picture at times with too much alcaholism, violence, and racism, but underneath it all there is a great deal of love which makes the stories comforting and redeeming. Alexie has a lyrical voice, and when combined with his authenticsity, beautiful, rich stories are produced. Aside from those academic traits, he is also very funny, honest, and affectionate throughout, and those qualities are what I will remember about this book far more than the descriptions of familiar hotels on Third Avenue and the basketball games played between Springdale and Wellpinit. It is a great, quick read, and a wonderful way to pass an afternoon.	2001-06-08

It not only discusses the physical aspects of running, but better than any other book I have read, it delves into the social bonds and distinctive lifestyle developed by a hardcore college athelete. The dedication these men display is phenomonal and motivational for a runner on any level, but the characters and relationships that emerge in this book set it apart from most sports diary books. These men work together several hours a day, sacrifice much of the traditional college social scene in pursuit of a common goal, and must support each other in an activity which few people understand and even less really care about. The season that is chronicled in this book has many highs and low, both for the team and individuals, and like any good book will, as a previous reviewer mentioned, make you laugh, cry, and want to go out for a long run. If you want to learn about running, the lifestyle of a college athlete, coaching, or even the bonds of friendship, this book has a lot to offer you. I could not have asked for more (okay that is a bit of a lie, the pictures in the book were poor quality at best, but that was of little consequence because the cover photo makes up for them), and I would highly recommend it to anyone, even someone not at all interested in sports.	2001-03-07

This is a man who made up his own language, roamed the  world to discuss mathematical theory, befriended and frustrated his hosts  and collabortators, and in is universally remembered as a loving genius.  The book itself is a series of vignettes about Erdos's life woven together  with explanations of numberous mathematical problems and theories, as well  as stories of other math legends. It is very inclusive of the Erdos's  predecessors as well as contemporaries, and shows the evolution of  mathematics, within the larger context of a biography.<br />I loved this book,  mainly because of Erdos, who was a wonderful character. I was a poor math  student in school, but Hoffman's descriptions made these incredibly complex  ideas that Erdos played with understandable and interesting. Also, I  learned a lot about the field of mathematics, mathematicians, and about  passion. These men and women devote their lives to theorems that may never  have any real appication, but they do it because of a love for the subject.  It was facsinating and inspiring throughout, and a wonderful book for those  who want a good story, great characters, and an understandable lesson in  math.	2000-08-04

They claimed it was wonderfully written, excellent satire, and funny, so that is what I expected. The problem was  that as with many overly hyped things they can not live up to your  expectation. There was good news with this book, however, it was very  intriguing and unique. The style of writing, the story itself, and the  characters are all quirky and engaging. It is a very quick read and a book  that once you get started you will not want to put down. The problems I had  with it, however, were that it was very disjointed (which as you read it  you will understand the importance of it, though you may not like reading  it)and after I was done I didn't really care about any of the characters or  the story--it is behind me down and I will not be going to all of my  friends telling them that this is a must read.    All in all, I think this  book is one you should get from the library, read in an afternoon and  return. It is not one that you will need to have around your house because  you will never have to reference it again and while it is enjoyable it  would be one that would have made me happier to have borrowed that  purchased.	2000-07-30

I understand that writing a book  about top-secret missions is a very difficult task, but the authors seem to  have done a good job of researching, so their main problem was that it was  not presented well. The book was very jumpy from one era to another,  especially in the last couple decades of the Cold War, and I felt satisfied  when the book moved onto a new story. All of the characters and missions  are interesting, but I do not feel that I understand them or know them  well. An earlier reviewer mentioned that this was much like a newspaper  article, and I agree with that beacause you are given the facts, but none  of the substance that really makes them absorbing. I am still interested in  submarining, however, so I think this was a good starting place, but not  complete enough to satisfy me.	2000-07-29

This it certainly does, but it also does a wonderful job of showing the romance and tragedy of the people who were disillusioned  after the Second World War and who constantly uprooted themselves and  refused to settle down, hoping to find some purpose and to constanly learn  about people and life. Kerouac's descriptions of his aimless travels  throughout the United States and all of the characters who wander in and  out of his story are all colorful and certainly captivating. For someone  who knew little of this lifestyle before reading this book, it was a  facsinating lesson.    I do agree with another reviewer, however, that it  would be interesting to read the text in the free form style in which  Kerouac wrote the book, but aside from that minor detail I could not  recommend this book enough.	2000-07-25

As always Irving does a wonderful job creating his characters and making  the reader interested in their lives, but Irving was not at his best this  early in his career. I am never a fan of Irving's short stories that he  puts in the middle of his novels (Pension Gripalzer etc.) and a majority of  this book is a journal written by ine of the characters, so that upset me.  He also does not include wrestling and does not make any of the characters  writers, which I always like in his novels because he knows the subjects  and writes about them so well. I think if you are looking for an  introduction to Irving or are just looking for a good book A Prayer for  Owen Meany, The World According to Garp, or Cider House Rules would be much  better bets.	2000-07-16

He pieces together a story better than any other writer I have ever read and he makes tales of swashbuckling men and fair maidens completely engaging even two hundred  years after that lifestyle died out. He writes romantic novels, where all  the characters embody both virtue and vice and are people you wish you  knew. I have not seen The Man in the Iron Mask movie, but from what I hear  the book and movie are not very similar. The book, however, is an  incredible creation, you will learn a lot about the history of the French  monarchy, you will fall in love with the characters, and you will want to  go out and read the rest of Dumas's books. I can not say enough how much I  liked this book.	2000-07-16

I have owned the book for a long time, and just recently decided to read it, but it was a  wonderful read. I liked the informal and personal style McCourt writes  with, that was only a small part of the book's effect. I learned a lot  about immigrant's in America, conditions that the poor lived in here and in  Irealand, and about family structure in a time when family values was not a  buzz word like it is today. The characters in the story come to life and it  McCourt makes it possible to relate to them and understand them. It is a  wonderful book and one that I do not think a personal library should be  without.	2000-07-16

As soon as I beagn, however, I found  that the story was more about the people involved and by concentrating on  their actions the author makes the dictionary and even even the English  language interesting. It is difficult to make a book a central charactrer  and give it a strong personality, but that is what Winchester does, and it  makes for a wonderful story. I think the best praise you can give an author  is that they changed the way you think and made something you had no  interest in  fascinating, and that is exactly what Simon Winchester did in  The Professor and the Madman.	2000-07-16

This is a book that I have read numerous times and with each reading come away with something new. It is written in a plain style, the story is very easy to follow, and the message Stowe wants to relate is very simplistic,  but the novel is such an emotional and powerful portrayal of antebellum  life that it is a must read. I would not necessarily rate Stowe as one of  the great writers in American literature, but she certainly is one of the  best at developing characters and emotional scenes, which more than makes  up for any of her shortcomings. If you have not read this book before or  may have once years ago, it is certainly worth reading again.	2000-07-16

It completely ignores  his affect on the Declaration of Independence, his influence on American  thinking, and most of his key inventions are skimmed over in a sentance or  two. His writing style is certainly antiquated (which is understandable)  but it makes it a difficult read, especially since it is boring to begin  with. I think it would be a much better plan to read a biography by someone  else who read through this book, save yourself the agony of getting through  this story and learn more about the man then you do here.	2000-07-16

Brands spends over 700 pages telling short stories about T.R., and while gives a nice over view of the man's life, it is a piece meal discussion. My other complaint is that the book provides hardly any analysis or commentary about T.R.'s policys and actions. He quotes  Roosevelt constantly, which helps explain Roosevelt's thougt process, but  as with many people, what T.R. thought  did not always align with what he  did, and Brands fails to fully express this. The biography is a quick read  and gives a thorough overview of the life of one of America's most dynamic  men, but it never discusses the legacy of T.R. or why what he did is still  relevant. A good book for someone looking to learn more about the man, but  somewhat lacking for a person who wants to learn more about the man's  accomplishments.	2000-04-04

This book is filled with disgusting and perverse stories, but while Manson freely admits to them and  rarely apologizes, he does give some level of justification. As far as rock  and roll biographies go, this is one of the best I have read, because  Manson writes well and usually has some cohesion to his commentary (which  is far more than most books in this genre can boast). I was much more  afraid and revolted by Manson before I gave I chose to read about his side  of the story, and after doing so I have a greater understanding and less  fear (though certainly no more respect) for him than before. It is a good  book.	1999-11-30

The  story focuses on Stalin's hate for Trotsky and his process to eliminate the  exiled communist, but it skims over too many of the details of Stalin's  other projects. This is a ine tactic, but it makes the plot too thin. Also,  while the narrator is well informed about Stalin's life and is a  megalomaniac, he is not believable as the monster who ruled Russia. It is a  good, quick read, but is more style than substance.	1999-10-27
