Every aspect of the language is covered with abundant excercises.  There is also a workbook for those who wish to have even more scope for student practice (though I've never used in class because the text itself provides sufficient work).  My only (slight) criticism is that the \\"ORAL\\" part of the review is quite minimal in the text; however, any French teacher should be able to provide supplemental oral practice based on, for example, the readings which introduce the chapters. To the previous reviewer, I must say that I cannot imagine any French teacher who is teaching an intermediate (or higher) level course needing an answer key!!! Those who can't teach at this level without an answer key probably shouldn't be teaching the course at all.	2005-09-11

I was certain I would love it--as I have Gregory's other books.  But, to my horror and disgust, I came across a sex scene between Tradescant and Buckingham--one in which they both spoke of their wives with a sort of smug condescension. Oh Yuck!

Jeez, you'd think Linda Howard had never written anything lighter than \\"Cry No More\\"!  OK, before you buy \\"To Die For,\\" let me clue you in: <br />(1) The title stinks and in no way reflects the content of the book. <br />(2) It is closer to \\"Mr. Perfect\\" than to the Mackenzie books (and it's light years away from \\"Cry No More\\").   <br />(3) The first person point of view is hilarious because Blair is one of Howard's cutest and most amusing heroines.   <br />(4) The readers who are lamenting the loss of the male POV are missing the point: this is not a typical romance: it is a comic-romance: think Tracy and Hepburn's classic comedies! Wyatt's POV wouldn't add anything to the comedy!  <br />(5) It's a chick book! If you're looking for the alpha male, he's here, but the focus is on a flirty former cheerleader who is, in her own way, WOMAN! Hear her roar! So there.  <br />(6) Buy the book, but put it aside until you're in a good mood and want some pure, frivolous FUN, and stop complaining because Linda--who can sometimes make you cry--this time makes you laugh out loud: She's a writer for all seasons.

Then came \\"that scene.\\"  I was so disgusted, disturbed, disillusioned that I wanted to throw the book across the room.  The problem is that I was almost as disgusted with the victim as with her rapist!  I couldn't read beyond that scene, but from other reviews, I gather that Clayton doesn't improve much--nor does Whitney. Good heavens, ladies, haven't we come further than to \\"adore\\" a book about rape? to weep with joy when the victim \\"pardons\\" her rapist?

Essentially, I agree with the previous reviewers that this is a good read, a (relatively) accurate and completely sympathetic portrayal of the early years of Richard III.  <br />I do think, in her effort to make Richard more sympathetic, Sandra Worth also succeeds in making him weaker, both mentally and phyically, than he probably was.  Worth's young Richard is almost always depicted as being terrified, martially inept, and subject to panic attacks, and so the reader has some difficulties in understanding how he developed both the prowess and the courage for which he became renowned (the modern idea of overcompensation just doesn't seem to work for me).  <br />But my bottom line is this:  If you give this book 5 stars, what on earth can you give Sharon Kay Penman's brilliant &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;--a far superior and much richer work?  <br />If you are a Richard III enthusiast, you'll like this book (and I do recommend it), but read it before you read the Sunne in Splendour--so you won't feel that this one is anticlimactic.	2004-06-21

In this otherwise wonderful triology, it is, I think, hard for the contemporary woman to see Josephine as anything except a victim--of her first husband, of the Revolution, of Napoleon, of her mother-in-law and the viper's brood she bore.  Within the constraints of her victimhood, she is an admirable woman, generous, a good mother, a (belatedly) devoted wife, a fine empress, but always victimized by those around her and by her era.  I strongly recommend the triology.  Once I began reading the first book, I couldn't stop until the last page of the third novel, yet, over and over, I felt emotionally distanced from Josephine when she became a door-mat for those around her. She deserved a better life; instead, she got three wonderful novels written about her.	2004-05-16

The writer confuses anecdote and analysis (and strings anecdotes together as if she were copying out her teen-age diary). The work is supposedly a \\"fictious\\" account of three women who enter a convent; the problem is that the characters are adolescents who (even for the time period) are emotionally immature, religiously ignorant (asking questions like \\"what's the point of all these rosaries\\"), and full of raging hormones but no common sense. Having such characters in a novel is no crime (witness Mark Twain!), but when the narrator is as clueless as the characters, you've got a big problem--and this (theoretically omniscient) narrator is truly incapable of any kind of deep psychological analysis or comprehension. In addition, Dr. Tavenner's ignorance of the ways of academe are embarassing; this (self-advertised) Ph.D doesn't seem to know that Phi Beta Kappa doesn't induct students who have only associate degrees! <br />This book is an amazingly immature viewpoint of convent life. If the topic interests you, however, I can highly recommend \\"Through the Narrow Gate\\" by Karen Armstrong--beautifully, even hauntingly written ...  If you want to read an excellent book about a nun who didn't leave the convent, do try \\"A Right to Be Merry\\" by Mother Mary Francis.	2003-06-22

For those of us who remember that damned war all too well, this is indeed a (perhaps THE) Vietnam War book!  It was hard reading--hard to have to relive and remember those times, hard to think about the shameful actions here at home and over there--even hard to think about the brave actions at home and in the war zone.  That war scarred everyone it touched, and reading this novel, all of those scars reopened and bled.  <br />I grieved for Ben Tyson, admired him and came to appreciate his stubborn honor and courage. I don't understand the reviewers who say they disliked him or were, \\"God forbid,\\" like him!  Didn't they get the point?  Ben did everything possible to prevent the massacre and, afterwards, did everything possible to live honorably with what he had been a part of. Ben's wife Marcy says it best, \\"This is a good man.\\"<br />I didn't think any novel could top CHARM SCHOOL or RIVERS OF BABYLON, but this one at least equals them in being skillfully written and tops them in emotional involvement.

I was overwhelmed with anger, rage, pity, fear, compassion while reading this book:  I hated for it to end (and plan to read it again). It's an incredibly moving story that should remind us all which side we're on since 9/11!<br />Even after visiting the Demille homepage, the only thing I can't figure out is how one man can know so much about flying, bombs, weapons, war strategy, terrorist organizations, the Israeli government, and human beings.

Presented with passionate conviction and eloquent wisdom, these life-stories show that the Groves of Academe need not be the heartless and treacherous mind-fields that they often have been.  There is another way, a better way.  Spore et al. offer an alternative, person-centered vision that challenges us to understand that professionalism need not exclude compassion, that the quest for scholastic excellence does not preclude the need for enabling (and yes, ennobling) nurturing.

While both translations share some characteristics (both are in poetry, both try to maintain the alliteration), you need only compare/contrast the \\"bob and wheel\\" (last 5 lines of each stanza) to see that Stone has managed to maintain \\"the sting in the tail\\" so typical of the original Middle English version--wherein a significant or surprising part of the stanza often appears in the bob and wheel--start with Fitt I, stanzas 4 and 7. Stone also maintains the \\"alliterative signaling\\" oral tradition: when possible he tries to alliterate only key words (Boroff seems happy when she can alliterate anything in the line, regardless of its significance to theme or motif!). As a medievalist, I am truly sorry to see so many of my colleagues jumping on the Borroff bandwagon when this superior, alternative translation is so readily available.	2002-05-06

I would write a long review, but found that almost everything I wanted to say had already been written by sussarakhen--another reviewer!  Read her review, please. <br />I would only add the following:  one of the most heart-warming things about this series is seeing the creation of a &quot;family&quot; around Eve.  Peabody's parents are the latest additons, and they are tops.<br />Although I would have liked to have seen more of Mavis, the child-man Leonardo, and the intimidating (to Eve) Trina, the only thing I really missed this time was spending more time with Sommerset!

But, I'm saddened to say that Penman has fallen into the trap of history with this one. In her previous books, few of us really knew that much about her topics.  Other than medievalists, who knew much about Maud, King Stephen, Llewelyn of Wales, Joanna (King John's illegitimate daughter), Simon de Monfort, etc.? But most of us have read or seen \\"Becket\\" and \\"The Lion in Winter\\"; and any medieval fan knows a great deal about Eleanor and Henry and Beckett! So we were looking for Penman's viewpoint of this familiar material--some satisfying psychological motivations and explanantions for the oftimes incomprehensible behavior of Becket, for example--and Henry, too, for that matter.  We were looking for the sort of \\"alternative understanding\\" of Richard III that appeared in Sunne in Splendour, for example. But Penman gets so bogged down in the excruciatingly minute details of the church vs. state dispute between Becket and Henry II that the rest of the story suffers greatly. The whole pace is off, here!<br />It is true that the minutiae are sometimes lightened by glimpses into the (still) fascinating relationship between Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry  (though I learned nothing new about them), but then it bogs down again--over and over this pattern repeats itself. It's wonderful to find (again) Penman's fictional Ranulf and his blind wife, Rhiannon; it's fascinating to get a glimpse into the ancestors of Llewelyn and the English-Welsh hostilities. But, despite these moments, this book moves far more slowly, loses its focus more readily that her previous works.  Worse, I don't feel that I understand Becket or Henry now any better than I had before--we see both men almost totally from the outside. All she really has to tell us about Becket is that he is a \\"chamelon\\" while Henry is \\"stubborn\\"!<br />Perhaps I was too eager to read this novel--and set myselfup for a disappointment? I know that I'm glad I bought it (and yes, I'll buy the last part of the triology, too), but not with the same enthusiasm as in the past. Sorry, Sharon, but I really got bored about half-way through, and had a hard time getting back into the rest of the story!  I really wanted to give this book a 2 and 1/2 star rating, but pushed it up to three for Wales!	2002-03-02

But this one is a gem.  WARNING:  It is NOT a biography of Henry VIII (nor does it claim to be).  It is a wonderful portrait of a court and an age.  If the details of everyday life enchant you, you will love this book: you'll learn what Henry's court ate, drank, wore; how they ate, how they drank, and when they wore what!  You'll get details about the various royal (and non-royal) residences that are very difficult to find elsewhere: how they were furnished, financed, run, used.  And this time, Weir is scrupulous in citing her sources and in using them well.  Where there are disputed facts, she indicates this.  When she is hypothesizing, she indicates this as well.  It is true that she appears to be quite fond of old Henry, but not as he became.  Rather, I think, she admires the potential that was in the young king, the goodness, basic decency that could have made him England's best (if not greatest) king.  The potential for selfishness, greed, paranoia, and self-delusion was also there--unfortunately, the bad side won!  After reading Weir's book, I now share both Weir's semi-nostalgic admiration and her regret.	2002-02-13

He may have inspired its writing, but the Bible is an anthology of texts, produced over a period of more than a thousand years.  Human beings wrote the texts.  Human beings used literary techniques to make this book as beautiful as it could be.  Some of those techniques include hyperbole, irony, metonymy, etc.  <br />One of my favorite examples of how a study of literary techniques can enhance ones appreciation of the Bible is the merismus:  a term used in rhetoric to describe a type of synecdoche in which two parts of a thing, usually the extremes, are made to stand for the whole.  So, when, in Genesis, the phrase &quot;knowledge of good and evil&quot; is used, it quite simply means good and evil AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.  We can clearly see this if we think of other, similar usages:  When Christ says, &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega&quot; he does NOT mean &quot;I am only the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet!&quot;  The words must be interpreted metaphorically to mean: I am the beginning and the end AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.  When, in our patriotic song, we sing Guthrie's words, This Land is your land, this land is my land &quot;from California, to the New York Island / From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters,&quot; we don't mean only California and New york, only the Northwest and Louisiana belong to &quot;you and me.&quot;  Guthrie was using merismus to say &quot;California to New York&quot; AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.  <br />So when I read comments like those on this page that this book is &quot;too liberal&quot; because it offers a clearer, better understanding of the sacred text of the Bible, I want to say, &quot;Open your mind; learn something about literary techniques like the merismus and you will be amazed at how profound the Bible really is and at how much you still need to learn about the Bible.&quot;	2002-01-18

Without a good understanding of the Church and Christendom, there simply cannot be a good understanding of the texts or of the society.  Even most contemporary Roman Catholics have forgotten (or never understood) topics such as the medieval concept of sin (mortal, venial, original), monasticism, fasting, the use of psalters, rosaries, breviaries, etc.  To fill in the knowledge gaps in these and other areas, I use and strongly recommend this book. I discovered it 8-10 years ago at Cambridge University where it was wildly praised and widely read.

This is NOT a great book; it's OK--it's actually a bit strange in places (so fictionalized as to be unrecognizable).  The idea is a clever one:  create 4 non-historical characters who knew Richard and present their point of view of him, but so much other \\"stuff\\" about these 4 unbelievable non-historical characters intrudes that you feel bereft:  Richard is almost always in the background, filtered through the stories of people you'll find it hard to care about.  The style is flamboyant and cloying at times (and \\"feels\\" old-fashioned). It's also not terribly accurate historically (although it never claims to be anything but fiction--yet one yearns for a bit more reality and a bit less fiction!).

Heaney's &quot;translation&quot; is really an adaptation of the original Anglo-Saxon poem.

What is most ironic is that the hardback version that I have offers the original Old English version in one column and Heaney's bastardization in the other--yet, if you will read the preface, you'll find that Heaney cannot even read  Old English!  I know that what is here appears to be &quot;readable,&quot; but it's so inaccurate as to be useless.  For a much cheaper, and much more authentic translation, try the Burton Raffel version.

Do read &quot;The Queen's Man&quot; first!	2001-05-25

Using contemporary writings, this collection of sources traces the calamitous impact of the Black Death in Europe, with particular emphasis on its spread across England from 1348 to 1349. Rosemary Horrox surveys contemporary responses to the plague. The almost universal belief that the plague was an expression of divine anger at the sins of humankind did not preclude the attempts to explain the epidemic in scientific and medical terms or to look for human scapegoats. The sources which are included show some of the social and psychological impact of the plague, chronicle its effects on the late-medieval economy, and illustrate the fear that spread with the disease as well as the diverse ways that such terror influenced social behavior. <br />Part One focuses on narrative accounts of the plague in Continental Europe and in the British Isles. Part Two examines explanations and responses to the plague, including religious and scientific. Part Three deals with the extraordinary consequences of the plague, its impact and repercussions. Finally the text ends with excellent and up-to-date suggestions for further reading.<br />Dr. Horrox's text is the most extensive collection of relevant sources in translation and is an invaluable addition to the field. This book should be a part of the personal collection of every serious student of the Medieval period.	2001-05-14

Unlike Weir, who had absolutely no basis for forming the conclusions she drew and whose manipulation of her sources is maddening, Penman's portrait and conclusions are eminently logical and psychologically reasonable.  No one knows what happened to those &quot;princes in the tower,&quot; but Penman's explanation is more than satisfying--it just sounds right.  She is not the first to vincdicate Richard, but she is among the best.  For a historian's handling of the same material, you might want to try Paul Murray Kendall's &quot;Richard the Third&quot; (see especially Appendix I where Kendall presents all of the evidence both for and against Richard--nothing in Penman contradicts any of the evidence; one cannot say the same for Weir!).	2001-05-13
