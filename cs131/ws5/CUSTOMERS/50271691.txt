I'd recommend both for a balanced view.	2005-05-27

Books	5	8	12	N	N	Excellent analysis	As someone who has also been on both sides of the 7th Day Sabbath fence, I found this well thought out book to be clear and strongly rooted in scripture.<br /><br />If you have questions about the Law that was given in the Old Testament, this is an outstanding resource.	2005-01-29

It will leave you feeling free and hungry for more of God's great grace.	2004-11-16

It is obvious she took a lot of time and effort in this one (perhaps now that she has a publisher, they have helped her with this). The concept is simple and therefore not too difficult for most people to follow. <br />Her tips in most sections are quite good - not too wild or kinky, but sensual enough that it has the desired results -- more passion. <br />One thing missing is ideas for romance to go along with the sex (romance and sex ARE two different things). If I keep tearing out pages just to fulfill my sexual lust then something is missing. If the only time I am paying attention to my partner and treating them nicely is during a sexual escapade, then they could start to feel like I'm using them. <br />I have found a good solution in the book, The Romantic's Guide by Michael Webb --it has thousands of creative ideas for letting someone know they are special (not just because you want to have sex with them).<br />If you use these two books in tandem, you will have the ingredients for a very blissful relationship.	2002-06-07

I would guess that most divorces actually take place because couples never really got to know each other well enough before they got engaged. Sadly, most couples decide to marry, then think about asking questions.<br />This book covers the main areas pretty well but I think left out other areas that could cause potential problems if not discussed. A more comprehensive book is 1000 Questions for Couples. I think it can only be gotten at questionsforcouples. com	2002-06-07

It is everything you wanted to know (and everything you didn't care to know) about romance. It has so much information packed in its 300 pages. My big complaint is that it reads like a text-book. Some women might enjoy reading through history and influences on romance in our culture but I believe most guys will get frustrated trying to find the romantic tips they are looking for.<br />If you don't mind sifting through a lot of text to find your ideas, this book will be a great asset.<br />Two books that are easier to read and have more practical ideas are The RoMANtic's Guide by Michael Webb and Creative Romance by Doug Fields.	2001-11-21

For example, everyone knows that bringing home a bouquet of flowers makes someone feel nice.<br />I dont think this book will inspire you much but it is still worth a look. If you are wanting ideas that are more creative and will have a bigger &quot;wow&quot; factor, I'd highly recommend The RoMANtic's Guide by Michael Webb.

William Harley has a great track record of putting out relationship books that are honest, insightful and useful. This one definitely fits the bill. <br />For most couples falling in love is the easy part. Staying in love is a completely different matter. Harley dispenses his typical wisdom into the main reasons marriages fail and what you can do to keep the love ever present. No one needs to fall for the lie that love and passion can't be as present 20, 30 or 40 years into a marriage.<br />Anyone seriously wanting to keep the romance and passion alive (or revived) in their relationship should definitely take a look at this book AND The RoMANtic's Guide - which I believe is the best tips and idea book to come out in my 30 years of marriage counseling. If every couple read and followed these two books, I'd be out of a job. Which would be a good thing.<br />Dr. Bradley Sears, Spokane Washington	2001-11-07

It is obvious she took a lot of time and effort in this one (perhaps now that she has a publisher, they have helped her with this). The concept is simple and therefore not too difficult for most people to follow. <br />Her tips in most sections are quite good - not too wild or kinky, but sensual enough that it has the desired results -- more passion. <br />One thing missing is ideas for romance to go along with the sex (romance and sex ARE two different things). If I keep tearing out pages just to fulfill my sexual lust then something is missing. If the only time I am paying attention to my partner and treating them nicely is during a sexual escapade, then they could start to feel like I'm using them. <br />I have found a good solution in the book, The Romantic's Guide by Michael Webb --it has thousands of creative ideas for letting someone know they are special (not just because you want to have sex with them).<br />If you use these two books in tandem, you will have the ingredients for a very blissful relationship.	2001-06-19

It has revitalized my marriage and make me a lot more understanding how simple yet important romance can be. If this author hasn't been on Oprah yet, I bet he will be soon.	2000-09-20
