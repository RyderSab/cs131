Prince Charming's now in as Mayor, vice King Cole, and is finding that there's more to running Fabletown than he may have thought.<br /><br />In addition, we have a one-shot about Cinderella, and her private dealings...and a two-part story about Bigby Wolf in World War II.<br /><br />A worthy addition to the Fables line.	2005-06-06

Had things gone just a little differently in a few battles, it could have been them, rather than the samurai, who effectively ruled Japan, with unknowable consequences.

That said, it's the most complete account I've ever seen of this little-known ally of the James Gang.<br /><br />George Washington Loomis raised a family of criminals---even though they could have been rich legitimately, they preyed on neighbors and others impartially, until a brave local constable decided to put a stop to their shenanigans.  Present-day Loomises are mostly ashamed of this, and the gang is little-known outside of its old haunts in Central Upstate New York.	2005-01-08

One is about Jack, the trickster, who gets in over his head during the Civil War after fighting for the Confederacy, and the other introduces us to &quot;Smalltown,&quot; the community of Lilliputian exiles.<br />The stories are, as always, good, but be warned: these comics may be about fairy-tale people, but this is not meant for children---there are scenes involving nudity and other &quot;adult&quot; subjects.

The stories are, as is usual in a short-story collection, rather uneven in quality, but Effinger just about couldn't write dull or bad---I just liked some better than others.  With introductions to the stories by his longtime friend Barbara Hambly, this book belongs in any Effinger fan's collection.

Discontent has been brewing up there for quite a long while, and while I don't want to spoil the story, I will say that rebellion does break out.<br />As always, the look at &quot;modernized&quot; people from famous stories is fun, and I have to say that while I didn't agree with a lot of what the revolutionaries did, I could understand why they finally rose up.<br />For a little extra spice, there are a lot of references to a famous literary classic scattered through.	2003-08-05

John Rolfe VI is Not Nice in the way so many of Stirling's characters are, but compared to the _real_ villains, he's very nice indeed.  His ideas of Utopia are not what I would choose, but make a lot of sense considering where he's starting from and who he is.

It wasn't her husband's evil machinations that prevented her getting a lawyer so much as her own rapidly-earned reputation as an impossible client; it wasn't her husband's evil machinations that got custody awarded to him as much as her own increasingly insane behavior.<br />For an interesting exercise, reverse the genders in this story, and try to convince yourself that \\"Billy\\" Broderick, after killing his high-flying ex-wife and her new toyboy in their bed in their house, would escape the death penalty.  A lot of women, I've noticed, are ardent feminists until the subject of \\"equal punishment for equal crimes\\" comes up---at that point they're as old-fashioned as it gets.<br />The ones I really felt for were the kids, and, to a lesser extent, Linda Kokelna, the forgotten victim.	2003-02-08

While the authors tell many scary stories about fundamentalists, they consistently forget that even fundamentalists have the right to &quot;peaceably petition&quot; for changes they want.

At one time &quot;Tom-shows&quot; were a large subset of the theater industry, since even the most pious folk could find very little to object to in going to one.

The only trouble with this sort of memoir, whether it's by Joey or by somebody who infiltrated the Klan, is that there is no way to corrobrate his stories.  Even so, the discussion of how crime as a business operates is very interesting, and \\"Joey's\\" ideas about what could be done to hurt it are right on the money.  Basically, legalizing gambling (which has been done in many places since this book came out; I've got two copies of the original paperback printing) legalizing drugs, and in general, legalizing victimless crimes, would have all but put the Mob out of business or forced it to go respectable, like some segments did after Prohibition---many fortunes in the liquor or entertainment industries can trace their origins to gangsters.	2002-03-23

Kim Newman, writing as Jack Yeovil for reasons that escape me, is a talented writer with an interesting and original take on the Warhammer universe and on vampirism.  His version doesn't quite jibe with the game's rules, but that makes it more interesting.  One of the real stars of this book, though, is the villain...a monster that makes Voldemort (in the Harry Potter universe) or Darth Vader look like a couple of little old ladies.  His idea of a funny practical joke to play is itself worth the price of the book.  Although this isn't a great classic of fantasy literature, it's far and away above the normal run of game-related books.	2002-03-03

Besides the scripts themselves, there is background material, like &quot;Captain Darling's Emergency Request For Transfer to Somewhere Much Safer,&quot; and Baldrick's school report, where he gets good grades in corporal punishment, the teacher noting that B's piglety squeals make beating him more enjoyable.<br />Of course, to any &quot;Blackadder&quot; fan, the real high spot is the deliciously bitchy dialogue, particularly when Blackadder's telling someone off.  The first-season Black Adder wasn't as good as the others IMO; but after that, the writers really got into their stride.	2002-03-03

The investigation was hampered by jurisdictional disputes and the primitive forensic science of the time, and is officially still unsolved.  It was a great stir in its day, and everybody had opinions about it; Edgar Allen Poe based his &quot;Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; on it.  Geary gives us the known facts, and proposes a solution in line with the modern thinking on the subject.  His evocative artwork makes this book a visual treat.  I'd love to see him tackle the alleged murder of Sarah M. Cornell by the Reverend Ephraim K. Avery; it occured at nearly the same time this case did, and is still officially unsolved.	2001-11-16

Gibson shows us a world where high technology has been taken over by the &quot;street,&quot; and takes us into the underworld of Chiba City in Japan, and the mighty Sprawl of cities that covers most of the Eastern United States---although he's careful to never, ever say whether the United States itself, as a nation, is still in business.  His protagonist, Case, is not as vividly drawn as he could be---I felt I knew his partner Molly Millions a lot better, and frankly, liked her more.  Still and all, this book was hugely influential, and anybody wanting to know where the SF field has gone can't afford to miss it, even if they hate &quot;cyberpunk&quot; cliches.  This is where a lot of those cliches were started, back when it was all brand-new and full of life.	2001-10-20

As with all anthologies, the quality of these stories is uneven at best, but when Gibson's good, he's very, very good indeed, and when he's not so good, he's still an author who repays reading.	2001-10-20

I admit it; I bought this book mainly because Donna Barr, one of my favorite artists, illustrated it.  However, I found it quite enjoyable reading, both for its look into subcultures I hadn't known existed (and sexual variations ditto) and for its calm, &quot;Miss Manners&quot; approach to etiquette for extremely non-traditional people, social situations, and subcultures.  It would be quite useful to anybody who wants to get into this sort of activity, as well as to those who find that a loved one is involved and want to know how to react and what to say.	2001-10-19

I particularly liked Tanya Huff's story of the brother and sister assassin team that she later featured in her novel _Fifth Quarter,_ and Fiona Patton's tale of a slightly-alternate magical Italy where &quot;death mages&quot; and the Church wage an underground war.  The nice thing about anthologies in general is that they can make one aware of writers, and works, that one might miss otherwise.  The bad thing is that the quality of stories can be very uneven, but that's not much in evidence here---Greenberg's an experienced editor working with pros.	2001-10-19

Tanya Huff's Dark Queen's take on quite a few traditional fairy tales is well worth a look, and Fiona Patton's necromancers come back, along with the slightly-twisted magical &quot;Italy&quot; they live in.  We get to see the early years of a very famous villain, and, in the context of a four-color comic world, learn with a person obviously based on one of the most famous comic villains about why evil must be evil, and why evil must be.	2001-10-19

In all the fuss, her actual ideas and views were generally shoved to one side, to the point where she said in her _Playboy_ interview that she could sympathize with Karl Marx(!) toward the end of his life, when he said that he was not a Marxist.  The rather abrupt end of the organized Objectivist movement in 1968 was also the end of a great deal of her influence, and she became a figure more of legend than history long before her death.  With this book, Merrill gives us a view of Ayn Rand's actual beliefs, as opposed to those attributed to her by the Usual Suspects, and some background as to how she came to the conclusions she did.  It's disappointingly short, but Rand scholarship is evolving constantly.	2001-10-19

Unlike _Bimbos of the Death Sun_ et seq., there's no attitude of &quot;oh, look at the freaky weirdos who should get a life,&quot; instead, we get a sympathetic look at the SCA's subculture and how it meshes and clashes with the surrounding &quot;mundane&quot; world.  The various groups within the SCA are presented fairly faithfully, although things now are not quite as they were when she wrote this book.  The mystery element is honestly puzzling, and hinges on a bit of SCA lore that's in front of the reader's face from the beginning.  A good first mystery novel, with an unusual setting.	2001-06-08

The references to computers date the book somewhat (486s have not been state-of-the-art for some time now, to put it mildly)but the book brings up valid questions about privacy on the Net, as well as the rights of accused criminals vs. the rights of the public.  If Jay Fletcher weren't fictional, I could probably fall for her.	2001-03-08

Sprague de Camp, whose recent passing saddened all of us who had had the pleasure of meeting him or reading his words, wrote on many different subjects.  Among the other things he tackled was biography, and with this effort he produced what will probably be known as the definitive biography of the troubled Texan writer who created Conan, Solomon Kane, and King Kull.  Although some of this material had appeared earlier, it was in amateur and semi-professional magazines of extremely limited circulation, and a great deal of it is material that could never have fit into those magazines, oriented as they were to the hardcore &quot;Conan&quot; fan.  De Camp, his wife and his collaborator travelled through Texas to speak to the people who had known Howard in his own lifetime, as well as those who had merely experienced Texas in those years.  Robert E. Howard was a troubled, moody man who escaped from an unsympathetic environment for a person with his bookish tastes into fiction.  Besides Conan, Kane and King Kull, he produced fiction in many different areas, and sold to many different markets in the days of the &quot;pulp&quot; magazines.  He was also quite a talented poet, and samples of his verse enliven this book considerably.  Among the other ways this book is useful to a person wishing to know more about Robert Howard, it contains a bibliography of all the works the Texan created.  Written in a clear, engaging style, this biography evokes a period long gone, but not all that far away.	2001-01-11

Guiteau, a megalomaniacal failure at preaching, the law, and almost everything else he had tried.  The drawings are evocative of the time and place, and give a clear idea of the events.  The lives of Garfield and Guiteau are traced, and Guiteau's mental illness is made quite clear; today, he would almost certainly be sharing a room with John Hinckley.  I'd like to see this whole series reprinted: one of them is out of print and apparently unavailable.	2000-11-23

To most people, the name Jesse Harding Pomeroy means nothing.  But to the people of Massachussetts from the mid-1870s to the mid-1920s, and even beyond, it was the name of a monster.  Jesse Pomeroy was one of the youngest people ever sentenced to death, and when his sentence was commuted, it was to solitary confinement for over forty years.  His record of time in solitary is only equalled by the Birdman of Alcatraz.  Still, when one considers the appalling cruelty and sadism of his crimes, including two particularly shocking murders of young children, it's very difficult to feel sorry for him.  Pomeroy made a cameo appearance in Caleb Carr's _The Alienist,_ but Carr changed a few facts---for starters, Pomeroy was never, ever in Sing Sing, but served his sentence mostly at Charlestown Prison in Greater Boston.  At a time when many people sigh for an imaginary lost Utopia in the past, when all children were good, it's salutary to see that so little has changed.  Were Pomeroy to appear today and be caught, the terms of the controversies that would swirl around his head would hardly differ from those that actually did, back in the days of President Ulysses S. Grant. Serial killers, even child serial killers, are, unfortunately, nothing new, and neither are the scapegoats blamed, such as lurid popular entertainment.  I have to say that if Pomeroy had been hanged, even at fourteen, the world would have been a bit better, cleaner place.  Even hardened bleeding-hearts would have difficulty sympathizing with him much.	2000-10-26

Well, at long, long last it's out and I can quit gnawing my fingernails.  _On the Oceans of Eternity_  lived up to its predecessors in the &quot;Nantucket Trilogy&quot; and tied up the main plotlines, with room for  sequels and other books in this continuity.  A few things got resolved more  quickly than I would have preferred, there was one plotline in particular  that I could have done without, and there were some rather obvious homages  to a famous war movie, but this book, like the other books in the Trilogy,  was an extremely interesting, enjoyable read.  I can recommend it highly to  anybody, along with its mates, although I'd advise reading all three books  in order so you know who is who.	2000-04-13

So, when Charles' marriage went on the rocks, I felt sorry for both  of them and felt that the endless coverage couldn't have helped---could  anybody have worked out problems in their marriage with Fleet Street all  but crawling down the chimney to report every bit of tittle-tattle they  could?  The majority of coverage took Diana's side, so I always did kind of  lean toward Charles, if only because I'm suspicious of one-sided coverage  of anything.  Junor's book, although not wildly well-written and prone to  gush over Charles' virtues, is a needed antidote to a lot of the  sentimental pishposh that came out in the wake of the accident.  BTW, one  thing that really, really disgusted me in the wake of the accident was the  cold-blooded way the news media in the UK whipped up the mob at the royal  family.  How _dare_ they not be in London?  Never mind that they had two  boys on their hands who had just lost a mother they loved!  We, the people,  _demand_ that they mourn, and mourn _our_ way!  Okay, so the royals showed  the stiff upper lip---what was expected of them?  To gash their cheeks like  Huns mourning the death of Attila, mourning with blood instead of water?  To howl and wail like Chinese professional mourners?	1999-11-25

Despite this, I think I'm objective enough to rate this book, and the  series, fairly.  Like all anthologies, it's uneven, and marked heavily by  the editors' own beliefs.  Still and all, for those in search of good  military SF in short story form, as well as non-fiction articles on the  subject, picking this whole series up is a good idea.	1999-08-03

I first ran across this book in one of my favorite hangouts, the Barnes and Noble bookstore in Des Moines, IA, on February 23, 1997.  You may reasonably ask: &quot;How do you know this for sure?&quot;  Well, the fact  that the date was the first year anniversary of my own mother's murder kind  of helped fix the date in my mind.  I'd been sitting around my apartment  until I felt that if I stayed there any longer, the walls were going to  close in on me, so I headed out and ended up at a bookstore.  Other people  go to churches when they're upset---for me, it's a bookstore or a library.  This book was on the shelves, and I took it down, curled up in one of the  comfy chairs that B+N provides, and started to see what the Goldman family  had to say.  I soon found myself so choked up that I had to put the book  down---and I giggled through the whole ending of the movie _Love Story._  The Goldmans remind us that every murder has victims other than the dead  person---the murder hits at the families and friends of the dead person, as  though the murderer had aimed at them as well.  This book should be on the  shelves of all victims-rights advocates.	1999-07-13

Well, Claire has done it yet again.  Three for three, so far.  I got my copy from the original publisher, and devoured it immediately.  She updates some items from the original book, _101  Things To Do 'Til the Revolution,_  but a great deal of the advice is new, and she takes advantage of the  attention she got with her first book to pick the brains of people more  knowledgable than she on subjects she's admittedly shaky on.  If you're  looking for rationales to go blow up government offices, give this one a  solid miss.  If you want things to do to make _yourself_ free _now,_  without having to go live in the woods and eat mice, or run off to some  libertarian never-never land, try this one on for size.  Almost everything  Claire mentions is well within the capabilities of a normal, everyday  citizen with incentive, who's willing to reclaim her life from the  Bureaucrazy.	1999-06-01

The color photographs are far better than the usual paintings or black-and-white  photos, and the evolution of the uniforms of the major combatants is quite  interesting.  I would have liked more stuff about the minor combatants,  such as Serbia, Romania, Japan, et. al., as well as more Austria-Hungary,  but on the whole, this book does what it sets out to do, and since it is  geared toward an English-speaking public, the emphasis on the Western Front  is not out of place.	1999-05-25

I found it a bit over-the-top myself, as I  don't like being bludgeoned over the head with a Message in my fiction,  even one that I agree  with...but I liked the book.  A lot of people have  complained that this book paints fans in too flattering of a light.  Granted, but they're supposed to be the heroes, and I've often wondered:  Why is it that someone who's a stone fanatic about, forex, professional  football-watching, is considered perfectly normal, no matter how much this  hobby distorts his life---while SF fans are considered geeks and nerds?	1999-03-29

Like Mr. Koman, I've been bitterly disappointed in NASA's floundering, post-moon-program.  However, Mr. Koman wrote a novel about how private people could conceivably take the next step---without the layers of  bureaucracy NASA has accreted about itself, without the hysterical concern  for public relations that plagues any publicly funded effort such as NASA,  and taking advantages of technology that, when the Saturn V was flying, was  a dream for the far future, but which is well within the reach of  (somewhat) ordinary people today---just for starters, the computer I'm  entering this from makes the best at NASA in the early sixties look  absolutely sick.  I could have used a &quot;Guide to Spacecraft&quot; in  the back, and the book _is_ awfully long, but on the whole, I recommend it  very highly.

Although Romania's contribution to World War II, both on the Axis and  Allied sides, was much greater than Italy's, it has received very little  attention in the West.  This is mainly because almost all Romanian action  was on the Eastern Front, save for air actions against Western Allied  planes raiding over Romanian oil-refining plants, and therefore got little  attention from West-oriented historians.  Axworthy has remedied this  situation with this dry, thorough, careful overview of the Romanian  experience in World War II.  This is a valuable reference tool, but not for  pleasure reading...hopefully, the change in circumstances in Eastern Europe  will eventually bring out livelier memoirs of Romanian veterans before they  all pass away.	1998-08-22

However, you can take the scholar out of the cloisters,  but never the scholar's instincts out of the scholar.  While incarcerated, Dr. Aman put his time to use observing his fellow convicts' mores, folkways, and slang, and he now shares the fruits of his researches with us.  Dr. Aman is, to say the least, extremely unhappy about his imprisonment, which he sees as totally unjustified and excessive, and caused by malice directed toward him by a Wisconsin judge.  As I've said, I do not know what the real story is, or what the other side would have to say for themselves...but, reading this, I pray that his anger is never turned toward me, for he is probably _the_ ranking expert on &quot;Maledicta,&quot; or swearing and bad language, and could crisp me to a crackly crunch.  Much of the book is in the form of a gossipy letter to Hillary Clinton, First Co-Conspirator, since Aman apparently believes that she'll soon be experiencing more-or-less what he went through.

I  value my fannish friends, and dislike hostile caricatures by someone from outside.  It's rather like how a member of an ethnic group can make ethnic jokes about that group in safety, while an outsider should not do so.  To be sure, the caricatures in the book did resemble people I know, but not _everybody_ at a typical con resembles these stereotypes.  Many of us do have decent jobs, fulfilling love-lives, and normal-range weight.  Also, as a mystery, I found it rather contrived and the denouement extremely difficult-to-swallow.	1998-03-31
