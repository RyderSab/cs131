Erickson: Selected Papers of Stephen Gilligan	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Yummy	Please feel free to email me if you want specific information about the quality of this wonderful collection of essays by Dr. Gilligan, but for now all I want to say is that this book continues Dr. Gilligan's beautiful and insightful suggestions as to how healing can take place in the counseling room.  These essays aren't as poetic as &quot;The Courage to Love&quot;- nor are they intended to be- but they are filled to the brim with incredible descriptions of Gilligan's psychotherapeutic experiences.<br />I feel compelled to recommend HIGHLY Dr. Gilligan's audio tape set entitled &quot;The Problem is the Solution&quot;.  As in all of his work, these tapes are a great example of how the healthy aspects of postmodernism can be integrated into the enduring psychodynamic, strategic and brief therapy conceptions and how this integration requires the inner work and practice of the practitioner.  Gilligan weaves in gorgeous poems, compelling antidotes and his wonderful sense of humor throughout these twelve tapes.<br />And, of course, &quot;The Courage to Love: Principles of Self-Relations Psychotherapy&quot; should be required night-time reading for anybody in the field.	2004-03-04

The only negative aspect is that there are some gaps in terms of what the listeners get to participate in. The sound quality is perfect, but occasionally Steven will reference group processes that just are not included in the tapes.  That said, what is included fits together in a way that the listener can enjoy without feeling necessary information is left out.<br />Gilligan is a poet and brings a beautiful asthetic component to each idea he utters.  He is also very human and, therefore, does much to shrug off the inevitable 'guru' status that he could easily take on.  His stories are compelling and highly instructive.  He examples are thourough and specific.  And the hynotic inductions are delightful to 'get into'...<br />But more than anything, I was most impressed by the general picture of therapeutic healing that Gilligan presents.  The main picture being that of learning to recognize the healing activity that is trying to be expressed in our symtomology, and how to develop and focused tenderness around the complex so that we can help what is trying to awaken to AWAKEN.  <br />Steven's model of psychotherapy is also recommended because it can move in a brief or long-term direction, depending on the needs and resources of the client.  I would highly recommend Steven's book &quot;The Courage to Love&quot; to fill out this experience as well as his hypnotic masterpiece &quot;Trance-Formations&quot;.	2004-02-16

Obviously you have to be already within a certain frame of reference in order to jive with this material, but if you are somebody who practices counceling or therapy and who is interested in the landscape where depth psychology meets the art of brief therapy, I would invite you to go nuts about his materpiece.<br />Gilligan beautifully weaves his model of Self-Relations into a serious conversation as to the dynamic that exists between and within both the client and the therapist.  He points to ways we can embody ourselves as we help our clients reembody their lives, finding the balance that allows them to gently touch their center.  <br />This book can be a meditative read in which you dwell within certain sentences and let your wisdom open up and sneak out in surprising new ways.  <br />It really is a masterpiece.

For instance, he is incapable of 'spinning'; the truth and nothing but the truth.  <br />I watched the episode of his show when he told the young man who lost his father in 9/11 that his father would be ashamed of him for questioning the Bush administration.  Yes, O'Reilly does yell at the young man and, yes, O'Reilly does assume he knows more about this man's father than the son himself...apparantly...What I mean to say is that O'Reilly wasn't really there.  If you watch closely you can see that some digital fiddeling has made it appear as if it was O'Reilly who was acting like a tyrant, but really I think it was a more liberally minded person.  <br />O'Reilly makes it clear in this new book that only he is looking out for our best interest, only he cares about us and that only he is willing to tell us the truth about how we should live our lives. Thank God there is one person who cares about me.  Also, he reminds us again and again that everybody, but him, is pushing an ideology on us.

Once you abandon all hope of 'grasping' these powerful meditations on the twelve spiritual virtues, you open the possibility of being taken in yourself, into the creative tensions through which virtue manifests in our being and actions.<br />In \\"The Power of Soul\\" Sardello continues demonstrating the art of spiritual psychology. With beautiful and highly observant sketches of inner phenomena, Sardello sheds light upon experiences so subtle that they often slip by our daily consciousness unaware. Yet, by entering into Sardello's description of each virtue's profile, we can slow down and begin to dwell within our own inner processes and, therefore, we can take our own independent steps in bringing the spiritual virtues into the world with our unique, individualized touch.	2003-02-11

Originally titled \\"Love and the Soul\\", Sardello's book takes an experiential look at the connection between the individual and the world. By staying within the realm of experience, Sardello allows the reader to begin the process of psychological research for him or herself. Sardello honors the original direction which Freud and then Jung trailblazed but points to the danger inherent in any exploration of soul which leaves out the world. Yet Sardello's experience of 'World' and his methodology which leads to it is what is truly groundbreaking about this work. <br />In \\"Love and the World\\" the world is not maintained to exist 'out there' independent of the individual, and yet, Sardello avoids any hints of suggesting the relativistic/constructivst conception which denies the possibility of talking objectively about realms such as Truth, Beauty and Goodness. Sardello maintains that to truly speak objectively about soul and the world, we must enter into the creative processes which they are. It is in the creative process that we can find, through sensing the creating activity of our own 'I', the link between ourself and the world. Sardello shows how spiritual psychology demands a distinction between the ego and the 'I'. This distinction has never been articulated in depth psychology and it is for this reason that the world has always been left out. And so after we identify the 'I' as distinct, not separate, from the ego, we can then experience the 'I' as the creative, non personal, yet completely individual, activity through which the world individuates itself and from which fully conscious, world oriented love is born.<br />How refreshing to read a sophisticated work in the field of psychology that earns that distinction by leaving theories, abstractions and in-bred language systems at the door. Like any truly improvisational art, Sardello is notcontent to present a system of finished concepts that can be repeated and systemized, but rather, he enters the active images of experience and from there performs language which can deepen the readers own explorations and questions. This is reflected in the poetic style which imbues each sentence of \\"Love and the World\\".<br />So much more could be said. And that's the point. This book does not attempt to finish anything. It's sole objective is to begin creating a new foundation for psychology which is based in active practice and which leads towards capacities for experiencing the creative, soul-filled and spiritual activities which are the world.<br />ps...my only frustration comes from what was left out of the new edition. In general not much is changed and in fact, some things are tightened up in a helpful manner. However the \\"Getting Started\\" section has been rewritten and while the new pages are a wonderful and, I believe, needed introduction to the book, the original \\"Getting Started\\" was a masterpiece. In the four or five pages of the original, Sardello wove together in a creativly condensed form all the images which live in the book as a whole. The orignial \\"Getting Started\\" also contains a few brilliant paragraphs on 'soul logic' which desribe the necessity for a new methodological approach to psychology. For these reason I would urge anyone who is still hungry after reading \\"Love and the World\\" to order the out of print original \\"Love and the Soul\\" from bibliofind.com. I hope that someday both pieces can work together in this most outstanding and potentially life changing book. Perhaps, Sardello will post the original words on his websight.	2002-12-11

And it does a great job.  While it must be said that I found aspects of the book unclear, I enjoyed the journey it took me on.  Landon is convinced that history, if looked at with an open, flexible mind, is trying to tell us something.  It is telling us that there are clear patterns of change which speak strongly against any attempt to explain away culture in a purely mechanistic/reductionistic fashion.  I also delighted in the sort of creative chaos which this book demonstrates. It it obvious that Landon's imagination is fully engaged with a search for more plausible explanations of the evolution of culture.  In fact, personally, I take this book to be an example of the beginning direction in which science must move if it is to begin penetrating the surface of things, if it is to begin presenting us with true knowledge, instead of abstract information based on hollow models.  One of the primary indicators that somebody is engaging with this transformation in science, is, I think, the quality of imagination that can be experienced in their work.  Now, obviously, I don't mean imagination in the positivistic sense of the word in which it is striped of any access to objectivity, but in the Coleridgian/Barfieldian/Goethean/Steinerian sense in which the imagination is understood as THE aspect of reality which, if applied in a trained, systematic manner, we must use to gain access into the inward aspects of reality. Unfortunately, modern science has quickly swept the 'inward' out, and we are left with ,as Barfield called it, &quot;an epistemology of outwardness with no inwardness&quot;.  I believe the ideas which this book is trying to present would do well to be grounded in a more explicit theory of knowledge- one which allows the very reasons this book had to be written in the first place to be addressed. The philosophical works of Owen Barfield and Rudolf Steiner are wonderful examples of this sort of epistemology.  Anybody interested in this approach would want to read, &quot;History, Guilt and Habit&quot; and &quot;Saving the Appearances&quot; by Owen Barfield and &quot;Truth and Knowledge&quot; and &quot;A Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe&quot; by Steiner.<br />The Eonic Effect should be read on two levels.  Obviously, for the content, but also with a feeling for the quality of thinking which is going into its production.  It doesn't matter if it is unclear in some places because actually, often, it is the places I find it a little unclear in which I sense the beginnings of the objective imagination mentioned above.  A great and very particular book which I think will be treasured by many interesting souls over the years.  I look forward to catching Landon's next work.<br />ps: just a little personal gaurantee: in fifty years it won't be nearly the big deal it is today to challenge Darwin because there will be so many strong movements in science which, while appreciating his efforts to articulate evolution, will be based on much more convincing grounds.  If you stand back and look at the literature surrounding the Darwin debate, it is clear that  we aren't fixated on Darwin's theory because it brings us the most insight, but because the possibility of having to let it go for new, challenging ideas, is terrifying...especially ideas which challenge the greatest taboo of all in science: the taboo which does not allow us to question the assumption that mind with all its creative activity is a product of nature with all its mechanical, blind forces.	2001-07-25

The work on the 10 senses is articulate such that the reader can begin to explore these modalities directly.  <br />Equally significant to any of the content of this work is the struggled style in which it is written.  Steiner never finished writing this work (or at least was never satisfied enough to publish)primarily because of the difficulty in finding a language which could hold this highly particular and objective description of phenomenological research.<br />The introductions are both helpful, especially Robert Sardello's preface which stands on its own as a significant step towards a new psychology based in a revisioned phenomenology.

For these reason I would urge anyone who is still hungry after reading &quot;Love and the World&quot; to order the out of print original &quot;Love and the Soul&quot; from bibliofind.com.  I hope that someday both pieces can work together in this most outstanding and potentially life changing book.  Perhaps, Sardello will post the original words on his websight.	2001-04-26
