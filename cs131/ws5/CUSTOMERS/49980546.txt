Pick up something like Ulrich/Eppingers's \\"Product Design and Development\\" for a much more thorough and useful approach.	2004-10-04

Aimed at a broad cross-section using technology for educational purposes, \\"Façade\\" powerfully offers a fact-filled holistic viewpoint plus more importantly checklists, tools and steps to assess current success/failure and action items to improve. Bottom line, it's suggested that as with office workers, despite billions spent, the raw usefulness of most IT falls way short of realistic expectations. {aside, Yourdon, Constantine, Booch, Jacobsen and other software gurus over the years have backed up this viewpoint}.<br />Thorough, attractive and provocative chapters span:<BR>- Definitions<BR>- Surveying as is<BR>- Instructional technologies for the classroom<BR>- Competencies and skills of students and teachers<BR>- Taxonomy of technology<BR>- People in the façade<BR>- Funding the façade<BR>- Resources - including plans and equipment<BR>- Planning the curriculum<BR>- Integration of technology<BR>- Successful learning<BR>- Reflections &amp; lessons learnt<br />By avoiding specifics of technology, and focusing on applications and management processes, this book is unlikely to date rapidly.

As such, spanning such a large domain, there is a tendency to offer outline information only and not refer to bodies of knowledge, expertise or tools (some over 30 years old)- all essential for the practitioner to be aware of. <br />Specifically missing: <BR>&gt; when talking about customer needs: Order Qualifying/Winning criterion of Slack (London Business School), Competitor-Performance matrices, Quality Functional Deployment (and all the other TQM tools), product design specification (engineering institutions), marketing perceptual mapping, personas (Alan Cooper, father of Visual Basic also Constantine- PeopleWare) ;<BR>&gt;  scenarios omitted any mention of formal scenario planning (Royal Dutch Shell,1970s);<BR>&gt; operations excellence and product-service innovation omitted any world class benchmarking or toolkit (including BPR detail), and seems unaware of role of simulation including discrete event simulation to model supply chain improvements (also dismissing continuous improvement out of hand, perhaps unaware of front-line results); and<BR>&gt; lack of broad knowledge/history context (interdisciplinary contributions from engineering, computer science to balance (non IT) business-marketing perspective- suggesting mass customization and human centric business much more recent than the case (human centric ergonomics innovated majorly in 1950s and 1960s).<br />Entertainingly written, readers may pick up a few ideas/checklists through the rich anecdotal tapestry offsetting the lack of charts, frameworks, detail and pointers to other techniques useful for the practitioner. Ultimately there are better books out there, unsurprisingly some feature as professional (engineer, manager) and university graduate texts (keywords: operations management, product-market engineering, technology innovation, and Senge's learning Organization).<br />[Note- Review based upon a complimentary copy sent by author.]	2003-04-15

(save perhaps 25% of words); and a need for a more structured view of uses of robotics in society &amp; markets (perhaps a rich-text /UML/whatever systems diagram with needs, resources, processes etc..).<br />Complimentary titles include Groover's 1986 robotics classic \\"Industrial Robotics : Technology, Programming, and Applications\\" (ISBN: 007024989X ); as well as numerous Open University (largest distance university in the World) advanced manufacturing course texts addressing robotics in a more structured and robustly applied manner.<br />Overall a timely, and interesting look at the last 3 decades of Carnegie-Mellon University's (and US) computer-science robotics research, with one set of intriguing possible futures in this fascinating field.	2000-12-31

It's not overstating to say that this book is probably relevant to all who deal with people (i.e. everyone)- addressing as it does conversations, relationships, family, mental &amp; physical health, tickling fights (!), evolution, group dynamics, marketing and consumerism in the media and religion, and coaching performance.<br />The well referenced, very well written and approachable chapters span: introduction; philosophy and history; natural history; sound lab and opera; chimpanzee paleohumorology; ticklish relationships; contagious laughter and the brain; abnormal clinical laughter; health; and ten tips (find a friend, more is merrier, interpersonal contact, casual atmosphere, laugh-ready attitude, exploit contagious laughter, humorous materials, remove inhibitions, stage events, and tickle).<br />There are interesting clues about laughter and courtship (in 3745 lonely hearts adverts), and well as social/sexual rank in organizations and behavior in \\"laughter episodes\\"; as well as many other useful scientific, and sometimes counter-intuitive findings over a decade of `laughter research'.<br />Strengths include: the depth of fascinating historical, neuroscience, experimental, and contextual information; the superb approachable writing style; the fact that keenest intellects have theoretically grasped at defining the significance of laughter (from the ancient Greeks onwards); and the absolute relevance to almost all for this seemingly-peripheral neglected area of research work.<br />Certainly one of the best-written, supported, rigorous, entertaining and useful books that this reviewer has come across- and more useful that many `pop psychology' texts for understanding about the human condition, as well as laughter itself.	2000-12-31

Aimed at anyone with an interest in contemporary and future wired business, `The Cluetrain Manifesto' focuses on re-engaging people in conversational interactions with business (rather than being segmented `over-the-wall' after approval by teams of lawyers!).<br />The excessively repetitive, rambling, example-light chapters span: the manifesto itself of 95 theses; Internet Apocalypso (some history- errors about AI (60s not 80s); Taylorism mentioned but not balancing human-centric ergonomic approaches (mostly 60s onwards); and us vs them factory distrust not just 1920s Ford, but 1800s UK factories acts (&amp; before with Luddites/ Mills etc..) ); The Longing; Talk is Cheap (newsgroups); Markets Are Conversations (great quotes \\"consumer... a gullet.. gulps products and craps cash\\"; and meaningless technolatin veterinarian describing dog as \\"a platform for sniffing, ... an open environment for fleas, and .. supports barking\\" ); the hyperlinked organization (mismatch company to staff through: communications, org chart, work management, career path, information, goal-oriented, deadlines, customers, office building and professional status); EZ Answers (list for e-success: relax, have sense of humor, find your voice and use it, tell the truth, don't panic, enjoy yourself, be brave, be curious, play more, ream always, listen up, and rap on); and Post Apocalypso.<br />Strengths include: the enthusiasm of tone, and extremely timely human-centric anti-impersonal business practices message- it's all about unscripted market and human conversations.<br />Weaknesses include: the extreme repetition; errors in contemporary &amp; historical technologies/business anecdotes; conflicts between contributions (Web is all about sales in one part, not at all elsewhere); and a lack of side-bar success stories &amp; detailed evidence. It would have been interesting (to this reviewer) for a formal \\"debate\\" framing of the message with contributions from process-oriented major consulting firms,and community interjections &amp; involvement.<br />Overall, `Cluetrain' is a worthy but lightweight book. Similar books include: Siegels' glossy e-brainstorm \\"Futurize Your Enterprize\\" (ISBN 0471357634); Jensen's human-centric `Simplicity' (ISBN 073820210X); and Bloor's transaction-focused generalist `electronic B@zaar'  (ISBN 185788258X).	2000-12-06

The core message is: branding (\\"anti- Cluetrain Manifesto\\"), value-adding communities (\\"pro-Cluetrain Manifesto\\"), standard interlinking systems (processes; backoffice; SCM; CRM etc..) between end-customer through value chains to tiers of suppliers (products &amp; services), and some basic financial ratios/measures. The author's also offer the formula e(b)= M(C)*2, representing B2B model= management (change times courage), emphasizing the energy of the new metamarketplace.<br />Weaknesses include: lack of referencing/ support for much public-domain anecdotes; superficiality of analyses &amp; case studies; rather abstract theoretical discussions; numerous technical errors (some e.g.s include: description 90s manufacturing actually 80s; problems with granularity in figures including 2.14; JIT 80s not 90s; SCM superficiality (no emphasis forecasting problems, data accuracy, prioritization, APS, Kanban etc..(Prof Towill at U. Cardiff has much to say on this)); and CRM &amp; intelligence confusion despite emphasis); numerous cliched \\"pop-culture\\" references (many movies covered) quickly dating content; summary &amp; repetition from of author's other book (Wisdom of CEO); and an ultimate message seemingly a sales pitch for PwC consulting services (where those who succeed will have embraced ERP &amp; CRM &amp; business processes). <br />Overall, `Meta-Capitalism' is a good book needing more science &amp; rigor (and better grasp of technology &amp; operations in e-marketplace context), and case studies/support to be amongst the best.  Useful as a discussion starter, perhaps with Deise et al's PwC 'Executive Guide to E-Business' (ISBN 0471376396); and Tyndall et al's Ernst &amp; Young 'Supercharging Supply Chains' (ISBN 0471254371); and any operations management text by Wild, Mullins, or Slack for operationalizing &amp; analysing markets, operations, and strategy.	2000-12-06

Better to look at college texts on `new product development' for sets of practical tools to develop new products or services; and to books like `Digital Capital' (ISBN 1578511933) which address the e-marketplace in a more structured manner.	2000-11-30

Useful appendices span: outline for a business plan; selecting the stock market; registration exemptions and resale restrictions; overview of the SEC and SEC rules and regulations; simplified registration under the small business disclosure system; and glossary.<br />Strengths include: the concise factual (dry) writing style; good use of exhibits and checklists; and useful easily-accessible content addressing legal, accounting, reporting, board issues (amongst others).<br />Weaknesses include: need for more sidebar success story anecdotes (which integrate the steps); mostly US focus; and relatively superficial analysis evidence supporting the success factors and `journey' metaphor.<br />Overall, a very useful working book, to be read with something like `Confessions of a Venture Capitalist' (ISBN 0446526800) or `E-boys' (ISBN 0812930959), for a fuller life-cycle, energetic view of the IPO journey.	2000-11-30

Also, perhaps links with formal micro-economic modeling would further strengthen the b-web framework (to this reviewer, it felt a bit MBA-made-up speak, at times (!)).<br />Overall, a useful mature look at the dynamic economics of b-webs in the global marketplace.	2000-11-30

The emphasis is on practicality, rather than theory, as befitting an author with significant practical experience. The only complaint, is that sometimes too much detail is given (reading a bit like a lab-report- the author's a physicist, after all!).<br />Overall, a great practical text which goes very well with the high quality and more abstract view (less case studies, more emphasis on process) in Kee Van Der Heijden's \\"Scenario's- The Art of Strategic Conversation\\" (Wiley, 1997, ISBN 0471966398).	2000-11-24

The main weakness (to this reviewer) was a need for more case studies, and perhaps more occasional  humor/lightheartedness.<br />Overall, a great text which goes very well with the high quality Gill Ringland's \\"Scenario Planning- Managing for the Future\\" (Wiley, 1998, ISBN 047197790X).	2000-11-24

Interestingly, Cypress Semiconductor is hailed here as a success story, and as a failure in Pfeffer's recent OK &quot;Hidden Value&quot; andOK &quot;Knowing Doing-Gap&quot; texts.<br />Alternatives include: Pfeffer's efforts; Goleman's OK &quot;Working with Emotional Intelligence&quot;; and Schwartz's inspirational &quot;Magic of Thinking Big&quot;. At the &quot;quality-end&quot; look at: the superb &quot;First to the Future- on Active Leadership&quot; by Willi Railo (rigorous proven methods to coach &amp; lead Olympic-standard people, applicable to all) (ISBN82-991169-5-3 Norbok A/S 1995); and Jensen's punchy 'Simplicity' (ISBN 073820210X  2000). More peripherally look at: &quot;The Time Management PocketBook&quot; and &quot;Yoga for Dummies&quot; offering approaches for motivation, focus, and action to being better balanced as well as corporate citizens. <br />Overall 'AQ@Work' is only worthwhile- but it could be amongst the best with more rigor &amp; science, less words, and more success statistics.	2000-11-17

Non-techies can do much better than reading this.<br />Weaknesses include: the extreme repetition between sections (perhaps 40% of a short book!); a very shallow treatment of subject; textual \\"slips\\" always representing US significantly more favorably than the case (compared with actual figures given in book itself) as well as mostly US focus; the scrappy illustrations, typos, missing illustration &amp; inconsistencies; a seemingly Macromedia-advert focus; a lack of analysis or justification for \\"broadband will come\\" beyond assumption that everyone wants latest technology (but what about the business benefit?); little concern for the global business environment &amp; wider society (and those non-wired countries where broadband will be irrelevant for foreseeable future); little evidence of understanding of any \\"real\\" office work processes and technologies; and an \\"interactivity\\" focus seemingly of \\"flaming car graphics\\" kind satirized in old IBM e-business adverts, rather than anything of benefit to user or company.<br />Better alternatives include: Siegel's Futurize Your Enterprize (for e-life mindset and enthusiasm primer), and Mitchells' E-topia for a more rigorous view of wired technology impacts including broadband on the built environment.<br />Overall, a quick web-search reveals more than this disappointing \\"throwaway\\" book- so perhaps only of use to those not yet using the Internet (who yet may be put off by the \\"tech-nerd-appeal\\" bookcover).	2000-10-30

This style involves a learn &amp; do structure to 8 anecdotes, rather than the usual hypotheses, case study evidence and checklists often used by many US educators &amp; consultants. Note `learn &amp; do\\" has been practiced for decades by military and engineering schools (for both physical maneuvers/value-add as well an intellectual stratagems/ designs etc..).<br />The repetitive anecdotal structured (e.g. introduction; background; values, philosophy and spirit; people/system, and lesson learnt) chapters span success stories from: SouthWest Airlines; Cisco Systems; The Men's Warehouse; the SAS Institute; PSS World Medical; AES; New United Motor Manufacturing Inc; and Cypress Semiconductor.<br />Strengths include: the broad range of case studies from different sectors including a few non-US examples; and the extremely timely \\"life-balance\\" and \\"people matter\\" message. <br />Weaknesses include: repetition of text (perhaps 35% of book); content gaps &amp; granularity problems (e.g. aligned individual/team motivation models missing); a passive observational feel; a superficiality of analysis; a lack of formal tools to carry out own \\"people-centric\\" analysis; an often colloquial cliché-filled style (dates quickly); inconsistencies in many financial table rankings and formatting; and a lack of labeling/scales on the most significant table in the book on p.239.<br />O'Reilly/Pfeffer suggest through this table (p.239), that exceptional performance from committed people requires the organization to use the HR levers of: values, culture and strategy alignment; hiring for fit; investing in people; widespread information sharing; team-based systems; and rewards and recognition.<br />Better alternatives include: \\"The Secrets of Software Success\\" by Hoch et al (100 global software companies success factors including people) (ISBN 1578511054 HBS Press 1999); and the superb \\"First to the Future- on Active Leadership\\" by Willi Railo (rigorous proven methods to coach &amp; lead Olympic-standard people, applicable to all) (ISBN82-991169-5-3 Norbok A/S 1995).<br />Having recently reviewed \\"The Knowing-Doing Gap\\" also co-authored by Pfeffer, I was struck by great similarities in case studies/data from SouthWest Airlines; Cisco Systems; The Men's Warehouse; the SAS Institute; PSS World Medical; AES; and New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. (couldn't remember if Cypress Semiconductor was featured). To this reviewer, both books cover a similar subject-matter less-well, and perhaps would have better been written as one really good book.	2000-10-30

Weaknesses include: gaps relating to  organizational (e-business) development lifecycle necessary to leverage the  technology and business models; manufacturing examples with errors (not all  manufacturing processes just have discrete steps!); real-time confusion  (see any control engineering text for precise &amp; correct definitions);  gap relating to object-oriented systems/ virtual organization development  (briefly mentioned about 100 pages late!); better referencing and  supporting material, and need for more sidebars &amp; illustrations, and  about 15% reduced text for same content.<br />This reviewer got the impression  that detailed discussions were avoided to minimize the need for frequent  updates/ revisions. Yet perhaps such tabulated comparisons of contemporary  tools for applications and organizational development, details of various  offerings from major consultancies, and discussion of web-enabled ERP, CRM,  CRM, BI (and all those other software acronyms) would have added value for  the reader to better implement e-commerce solutions.<br />Some alternative  texts include: the weaker inspiring `Futurize Your Enterprize' by Siegel;  the weaker draft `Exploring E-commerce' by Fellenstein/Wood; and Hoque's  `E-enterprise' which is initially promising but ultimately unsatisfactory   (too much repetition, error, and `jargonism' without support, despite some  good charts and structure, to be considered worthwhile). <br />Overall, a  useful and entertaining read- amongst the best books (read by this  reviewer) in the last year.	2000-09-19

To this reviewer, `e-Enterprise' just read like a  summary of parts of an MBA - strategy, e-commerce, change management,  introductory technology etc..- without evidence of a deeper understanding  of global business &amp; technology issues. As such a good starting point,  which I wouldn't trust to base a corporate transformation/ e-business upon.	2000-09-19

Interestingly, software  `guru' Ed Yourdon flagged up similar problems hindering software  productivity and quality in his `Rise &amp; Fall of the American  Programmer' (e.g. non-customer focus, markets prices &amp; labor costs,  poor quality development etc..). <br />Addressing the building layers (site,  structure, skin, services, space plan and \\"stuff\\") through a logical  sequence of chapters, to get the most out of this book deserves a thorough  read rather than a surface glance. The deeply referenced &amp; illustrated,  entertaining chapters span: <br />Flow- introduction and the time dimension;  Shearing Layers- of the different rates of change in buildings; \\"Nobody  Cares What You Do In There\\": The Low Road- easy adaptation in cheap  buildings; Houseproud: The High Road- refined adaptation in long-lasting  sustained-purpose buildings; Magazine Architecture: No Road- where tenants  needs ignored for photo-aesthetics; Unreal estate- and markets sever  continuity in buildings; Preservation: A Quiet, Popularist, Conservative,  Victorious Revolution- to address incontinuity and frustrate innovators;  The Romance of Maintenance- and preservation; Vernacular: How Buildings  Learn from Each Other- and respect for design wisdom of older buildings;  Function Melts Form: Satisficing Home and Office; The Scenario-buffered  Building; and Built for Change- imagining buildings inviting  adaption.<br />Strengths include: the great depth of reference material,  illustrations and evidence; easy-readability; an insiders' window on the  international world of architects and civil engineers; and suitability for  wide audience including lay-people interested in the built-environment and  society, as well as complex systems architects (hard engineering or  software development).<br />Rarely the text becomes a bit rambling (more  sidebars or bulleted lists?) and repetitive with unsupported assertions-  but that is the only negative. Improvements could include an additional  chapter cross-referencing (learning from?) `adaptive systems', `scenario  planning' etc.. from the other professions that explicitly use these  approaches to develop longer-term customer-centric complex adaptive  systems.<br />Overall a great read, that encourages re-evaluation of living  and working space (don't accept those dis-functional anonymous boxes behind  the trendy outer skin!).  `How Buildings Learn' is best read with both  something like `E-topia' by Mitchell (Architect and Computer Scientist at  MIT) for a visionary (and sometimes contradictory) view of the future of  the built environment; and Schumacher's `Small is Beautiful' for a  sustainable economic-development viewpoint.	2000-09-04

'17 Lies' deals with both  the negative Neuro-Linguistic-Programming or barriers (called here `Lies')  that everyone can drift into leading to less happy balanced lives; and a  few positive approaches to `re-program' oneself towards happiness.<br />The  anecdotal, light-hearted, easily-read contents cover in two parts:<br />1. The  17 lies- it's who you know, there's something wrong with me, I'm too old  for that, I can't because I'm afraid, I'd love to do that but don't have  the time, there's nothing I can do, I worry because I care, I'm sadder now  but wiser, the longer I have a habit the harder it is to break, people  really upset me, winning the lottery would solve everything, they're too  beautiful for this world, you hurt my self-esteem, it's a shame we didn't  capture it on video, that's just the way I am, what doesn't kill me makes  me stronger, and I am helpless.<br />2. Finding your deepest power- the truth  is we're all powerful, the idea of owning your own life, who controls  yourself, and finding your soul purpose.<br />Strengths include: the positive  believable message of the book connecting with the reader; the author's  depth of personal experience &amp; belief as a motivational speaker; the  forward-looking references to popular culture and society; and the good  readability and flow. <br />If one was on a desert island and able to choose  just one self-help book, this would probably not be it (perhaps the  Schwartz or Jensen instead?)- '17 lies' could benefit from more specifics,  anecdotes, sidebars, and tools to keep the reader entertained longer, as  well as a less-US-centric outlook.<br />Some other options to better manage  life include the books mentioned, and interestingly -`Meditation for  Dummies' by Bodian, Goldman's `Working with Emotional Quotient', and  various time management texts (all offering tools as well as inspirational  anecdotes).<br />Overall, '17 lies' is an enjoyable, quick and economic  reminder towards boosting your self-esteem and taking charge of your life  and happiness- far better than buying `expensive status-toys', (putting  off) living for the future, and giving in to those internal `demons' of  negativity! Despite that, more content, or reducing the price 50% would  increase the `value-for-money' star-rating.<br />[Note: This reviewer was sent  a complimentary copy of this book by the author.]	2000-09-04

Improvements could  include reducing pagecount for the content; coverage of more advanced  applications (e.g. business intelligence); a greater indication of global  &amp; sector business context; and more pointers to supporting material and  further reading.<br />Overall I liked this book a lot, but suspect a new  companion `advanced' text could bring things up to date, and offer readers  more tools and insight to improve their corporate information systems.	2000-09-04

By the end of the  book, the synergy of contributions &amp; style proved a key strength. Other  strengths include: the coherence, attractiveness and power of future  scenarios presented; and related discussion about the rich-poor gap within  neighbourhoods and the World. <br />Improvements could include: better use of  illustrations or tables in place of existing lengthier textual  descriptions; deeper material in areas beyond the MIT professor-author's  expertise of architecture &amp; computer science (e.g. world class  manufacturing, supply chain management, teleworking, appropriate  technology, and development economics); and greater evidence of significant  research &amp; results beyond MIT.<br />Overall very highly recommended-  'E-topia' is a must-read for business-technologists seeking a bigger  context, as well as &quot;blue-sky futurists&quot; seeking a balanced  pragmatic view of possibilities.	2000-07-18

Books	4	5	6	N	N	Working Book for �Brand You� Portfolio Workers	Written for the 90% of white-collar workers whose jobs will allegedly disappear in the next 10 years (those Dilbert-esque cubicle-dwellers), this compact `designer' book is part self-help &amp; motivation, part standard  marketing, part skills development, and part mindset-changing.<br />Whilst  encompassing a wide domain, and attractively packaged (once one gets used  to the quirky design) there is little really new here (apart from the  anti-Dilbert cynicism movement). Many of the suggestions are contradictory  (e.g. both be rude yet network &amp; show empathy; focus on time management  &amp; task, yet allow self-to be distracted by random influences etc..  etc..).  Peters point is that you can select your own activities ultimately  aimed at promoting a positive-outlook, for control of your own destiny, and  development of the skills needed to succeed in the uncertain future of  work.<br />Negatively, the book is repetitive, is US-focused (not  international-level), has unimpressive bland (to non-US) role-models  (Martha Stewart, Oprah et al), and promotes a greed-centred (ask &amp; you  will get) `style over substance' message. Extrapolating over society, one  simple view could be that you may get many competing, dissatisfied,  high-expectation workers all doing similar things (rather than specialising  or exploiting economies of scale)- not good.<br />Overall, a useful  recommended book for the increasingly portfolio-worker age.	2000-07-18

The problem: US companies annually spend  over US$100 billion on training and consulting often failing to improve  operations.<br />The well-referenced and presented chapters span:<br />* knowing  \\"what\\" is not enough- evidence, measuring &amp; significance of the  knowing-doing gap, and knowledge management projects.  <br />* when talk  substitutes for action- presentations, documents, mission statements,  planning, smart-talk, smart negative people, business school `bad'  training, and complexity &amp; jargon (remedies described include working  leaders, simplicity, vocabulary). <br />* when memory is a substitute for  thinking- convention &amp; consistency, culture, history, and need for  cognitive closures. <br />* when fear prevents acting on knowledge- fear as  management and the remedies. <br />* when measurement obstructs good  judgement- problematic measures, short-term financial focus,  over-complexity, and in-process versus outcome measures  (remedy-  simplicity &amp; focus on critical elements).<br />* when internal competition  turns friends into enemies- undermining loyalty &amp; teamwork &amp;  knowledge sharing,  and significance of interdependence. <br />* firms that  surmount the knowing-doing gap- British Petroleum, Barclays Global  Investors, and New Zealand Post.<br />* turning knowledge into action- 8  guidelines including- company philosophy, knowing from doing and teaching  others how, action counts more than elegant plans &amp; concepts, forgiving  mistakes from action, drive out fear, fight external competitors, measure  what matters, and lead by example.<br />Weakness include the subjectively dry  \\"unemotional/unengaging\\" style of writing; the verbatim repetition of some  sections in different chapters (perhaps a re-edit could reduce page count  by 25% without losing content); occasional errors in use of sector-specific  jargon; and relatively shallow treatment of significant subject- perhaps a  deeper follow-up text with case-study evidence of whether the  recommendations actually work together is due? Also the book neglects  attention to dot.com enterprises- which are through self-fulfilling  prophecies- transforming the global business landscape.<br />Overall a timely  text, addressing a real-problem, that is worth shelf-space. Despite that,  to this reviewer there were no new `aha' moments- as the  findings/recommendations repeated many already existing in change  management business texts spanning the last 3 decades.	2000-07-05

(like `Confessions of a Venture Capitalist' by Quindlen). These would help  the reader use the information rather than just be entertained by the  storyline.<br />Overall an intelligently, well-written, `fly-on-the-wall' tale  gamely capturing much of the passion, technology and business  acumen/judgment exhibited by a likeable &amp; lucky, hard-working company  with integrity. More entertaining than useful to most business readers-  hence the only average rating.	2000-07-05

Despite claiming an `adventurous  spirit' high ground, Ashbrook seemed to focus much on the personal money  aspects- perhaps the true motivation. Considering the described  round-the-clock several-man-years effort, I can't help thinking that the 2  founders should have achieved more sooner (or found experts to support)  and/or listened more closely to the venture capitalists, to help them work  smarter. <br />Whilst undoubtedly a fashionable dot.com personal adventurous  tale, this book does not seem to be written with the reader in mind, is too  linear &amp; repetitive, and ultimately unsatisfying (to this reviewer).  There are other (non-fiction) dot.com books which better cover the extremes  of human spirit, determination &amp; passion (e.g. eBoys, Confessions of a  Venture Capitalist, Secrets of Software Success etc..)- try these first.	2000-06-22

Such books should be read for balance (with 'Small is Beautiful' by Schumacher on appropriate  technology) against the ultra-hyped Web-is-all techno-imperialism seemingly  practised by global media and vested interests. Despite now being dated, it  still happens to be a good-read (bonus!). <br />An overview of 'Silicon Snake  Oil' contents follows.<br />Some drawbacks of vehicular highways in America,  unforeseen include: the mass destruction and paving of the countryside;  hour-long commuting faced by many workers; and pollution. Does the Internet  similarly dehumanize through it's virtual world? Is it's use passive rather  than active? How high (i.e. desirable) is the signal-to-noise-ratio? Is the  amount of true productive output (from business processes) very low  compared with the time spent (input) by the majority of users? The  lemming-like hyped adoption of technologies impacts little on human, real  and productive (mental, physical or other) pursuits such as cooking,  driving, dancing, building and praying. The Internet in practice frustrates  many with slow speeds during the working day; has poor navigation for  finding quality information (even with the best efforts of search-engines  and web-guides); is physically limited in the number of domain names  available; has many fly-by-night companies trying to initiate electronic  price-centred commerce; and is similar to television with many channels and  much mediocrity. Interactive multimedia- the goal of many sites and  intranet implementations- is essentially human-interaction-based (i.e. like  real life). Limitations in human-computer-interaction limit creativity in  games or business to linear progression through puzzlers/processes and  increased hand-eye co-ordination (a crayon and pad is much more  free-style). Where is the value for money- when a cheap pack of playing  cards can be used in an infinite number of games, yet a computer programme  costs 10 to 20 times as much and needs expensive computers/consoles to run  on? Also, Internet-inspired mental-entrapment with physical interaction  undermines social relationships (often gender-specific)- leading to a noted  increase in computer-widows. Some pundits have claimed e-mail has inspired  a literary revival- yet many messages and web-pages are mediocre at best.  The speed of e-mail and on-line charges lead to informality and errors in  e-mail (even through spell-checkers are common). The anonymity,  untraceability and credibility through access, remove social constraints  and can lead to cultural and personal insults. The metaphor of interaction  in the web misses a permanence, warmth, and local history- it is not a  reality. The computer and Internet are tools which should not replace  critical thinking nor constrain solutions. We program computers and they  program us- how many times have you wanted to \\"undo\\" a physical or verbal  action in real-life? It is suggested that the truly creative are often not  able to use computers.<br />Network/connection skills, due to the openness of  connectivity all vary and change frequently- it's not a permanent skill-  the need to keep up to date can be threatening and suffocating.  Telecommuting, with the lack of physical meetings and personal interaction,  often isolates workers and reduces loyalty. There is a concern for privacy  in a connected and open electronic business world. Posting a few web pages,  and joining as few mailing lists results in a few dozen messages per day-  which need to be glanced at in case something important is enclosed-  naturally an information and mailbox overload. A good proportion of  \\"quality\\" information on the Web are lesser research results not worthy of  publication in \\"real\\" academic journals. Computer technology elitism (the  super connected North Americans versus relatively unconnected Africans)  ignores thepoor. Access to a universe of information can't solve all  problems. The users are not paying for the infrastructure, which is  subsidized.<br />The complexity of computers lead to frustration compared with  similar technology yet simpler to use televisions and VCRs. There is a  culture of exclusion, and jargon accessed through a keyboard designed to  slow typists. All commercial software has bugs and crashes machines.  Repetitive Strain Injury, TSV etc. are increasingly common. Perhaps  computer users should work whilst using a treadmill (from fitness); say  hello to 5 people prior to switching the computer on (for social skills);  and read a novel after every computer manual (for sanity!). There is a 1000  page manual for using Microsoft Word- a simple program- which is more  difficult to learn and more unreliable than driving a car. There is  increasingly-fast obsolescence of technology- not sustainable in business  even compared to cars; which includes a steep learning curve to be overcome  with each new (often un-needed) version of software. Yet simplicity,  reliability, and ease-of-training are more important than features. There  is a barrenness of technoculture- what artifacts will be left for future  historians? Even e-mail between different systems is unstandardized and  often unreliable. Computerization can add a false staff credibility.	2000-06-21

As such, `Success' is most suitable for newcomers to technology  industries &amp; service companies, job-seekers, and students.	2000-06-15

Suitable for all levels within business, consulting and academia,  `Simplicity' is filled with insights, exercises and tools to help clarify,  simplify and energise towards smarter companies (leaving time for things  that matter).   <br />The concise, provocative, action-centred content  covers:<br />*Section 1 (the aha)- defining simplicity, complexity and the  need for change.<br />*Section 2 (simpler workdays)- using time, planning,  contracting, listening &amp; scanning, and engaging.<br />*Section 3 (simpler  companies)- customer-centric knowledge, building feeling of trust, content  design for decision use, project design to do something, and succeeding  with simpler navigation.<br />*Section 4 (simpler futurework)- changing the  structure of companies.<br />A few favorite parts include: defining business  complexity (causes include: integration of change, knowledge management,  communication, technology and unclear goals &amp; objectives); the focus on  customer-facing associates driving restructuring processes; the behavioral  communication model (relevance? specific actions? measures &amp;  consequences? tools &amp; support? benefits to self?); and the message map  for storytelling (our burning platform, where we are, success this year,  and our destination).<br />A key strength is the presentation (font sizes  &amp; emphasis, illustration, chapter punchlines, tables, exercises, tools,  lack of jargon, and sufficient anecdotes), and great potential for use as a  `work book' rather than shelf-book.  Many of the common-sense examples and  suggestions span the same domain as `Futurize Your Enterprises' by Siegel  (amongst others), with both more evidence and more useful tools.  <br />Recommended highly for getting rid of the \\"noise\\", and best using your  1440 minutes per day.	2000-06-07

Even several MBA programmes, a gauge of current business  thinking,   include `Shakespeare management' courses.<br />The engaging,  insightful and informative contents include:<br />* Act I- on  leadership-  relating to Henry V's intuitive inspirational leadership in beating the  vastly larger French forces at Agincourt, with lessons for today including:  be poised and ready to exploit opportunities, have courage and  determination, have clear vision and goals, closely examine details,  encourage straight talking and listen clearly, be competent in company's  field of activity, and set example caring for team.<br />* Act II- confronting  change- relating to Petruchio's search for fortune by taming the rich shrew  Kate following personal tragedy- turn misfortune into opportunity, set a  few clear goals and pursue heartily, don't diversify too far beyond core  competencies and change one thing at time, establish change as normal,  implement change quickly and boldly, and have a broad flexible plan to cope  with future uncertainties. <br />* Act III- organising operations- relating to  the assassination of Julius Caeser- recruit the best for key positions  (determined by personal attributes, job skills, motivation, teamwork)  avoiding boastful job-churning \\"assistant to, consultant or advisors\\",  succession planning, manage complexity of a \\"thousand actions\\" towards  goals, effective use of communications (know topic, preparation, be  concise, avoid \\"no comment\\" or \\"off the record\\", go hi-tech, prepare for  leaks), attention to detail and management of people.<br />* Act IV- risk  management- relating to Portia's management of husband-created severe risk  in Merchant of Venice- risk is necessary for success, analyse in light of  alternative options, seek facts and be wary of validity, act toughly, do  not risk all, and understand &amp; manage consequences.<br />* Act V- crisis  management- relating to Claudius and Hamlet- always be prepared for a  crisis, assess customer verdict (good or bad), have crisis team in place in  advance, report promptly appropriate information to the public, have a  crisis centre, practice crisis plans, be quick, include an outsider in  team, maintain operations during crisis without distraction, and let  intuition &amp; honour guide you.<br />* Epilogue- for life and corporate  management- recognise and manage existing assets, assume responsibility,  guard credibility, build strong and flexible mergers, select friends and  colleagues carefully, recognise frailties and encourage development,  prepare for crises and recover quickly, be fiscally responsible, and  finally prize reputation.   <br />The few weaknesses include the occasional  typos and grammatical errors, and the lack of bibliography assisting  further exploration of this concept. It could also be said that the lessons  already exist in management texts, and that business often looks in the  past for inspiration and guidance- but not so interestingly and ably  illustrated. Possibly those who have already invested effort in trying to  understand the many levels of Shakespeare's work will find this book easier  to read.<br />The significant strengths include: the light-hearted, energetic,  attractive writing style intertwining quotes from Shakespeare with global  contemporary examples (e.g. Aerospace, Pharmaceuticals, and even dot.coms);  solid contents with relevance to business with various \\"acting lessons\\"  (many summarised above); and the credibility and experience of authors as  senior global executives. A recommended refreshing look at business success  for all levels within business.	2000-05-25

When striving  towards best solutions, some engineers &amp; consultants may favour  technology complexity and quality, when simplicity and fit-for-purpose are  optimal. This book provides some inspiration and building blocks, to be  coupled with the usual simulation toolkit including systems analysis,  enabling development and implementation of appropriate solutions.  Similarly, the book appeals to a much wider audience that can embrace such  values in day to day life.<br />The inspirational well-written contents  cover:<br />*Part I- The modern world- problem of production, peace and  permanence, role of economics, Buddhist economics, and a question of  size.<br />*Part II- resources- education, proper use of land, resources for  industry, nuclear energy, and technology with a human face.<br />*Part III_  the third world- development, social and economic problems requiring  intermediate technology, two million villages, and the problem of  unemployment in India.<br />*Part IV- organisation and ownership- a machine to  foretell the future, towards a theory of large-scale organisation,  socialism, ownership and new patterns of ownership.<br />Improvements could  include up-to-date case studies (perhaps including material from VSO)  showing the benefits of the approach; and an update on where intermediate  technology is today.  Note- the book `Flexible Specialisation' by Pedersen  et al  (ISBN 1853392170 publ.1994) provides some such case studies for  Africa, Asia and Mexico.<br />Personally, this reviewer was inspired by the  book to lead an undergraduate team project with Intermediate Technology  (the company) and Sri Lankan men designing and implementing a self-build  fretsaw for educational toys in 1991. Overall a stimulating, worthwhile  addition to any library.	2000-05-25

It is suitable for industrialists/business people, as well as those interested in  appropriate business systems development.<br />The well referenced and written  contents span:<br />* A complete introduction- enterprise environments and  collective efficiency, flexibility of labour markets, the growing  importance of flexible specialization, new competition, technological  change and technological networks, technological and social networks  spatial elements (locations, clusters industrial districts), main research  issues, an interdisciplinary approach, and conclusion .<br />* African cases-  economic structure of small towns in Zimbabwe, diffusion of flexible  techniques in small and medium-sized enterprises, new competition and  flexible specialisation in Indonesia.<br />* Asian cases- lack of interaction  between traders and producers in footwear industry, technological change in  roof tile industry in Java, trade networks for flexible rural industry, and  weaving flexibility in South Korea.<br />* Mexican cases- industrial districts  and footwear industry, and the garment industry.<br />The development of  flexible networks supporting full-lifecycle development/delivery of  products/services and localising optimal marketplaces for producers,  traders and customers is showing benefits across the World. Other examples  include: the New Zealand hard business networks, many regional chambers of  commerce and special interest groups, as well as the informally developed  regions of exceptional world-class activity (e.g. Silicon Valley, UK  Motorsports cluster). Perhaps a companion volume documenting and analysing  such networks, as well as the impact of the Web, would be a useful addition  to the series. <br />Overall stimulating, with `structure' lessons applicable  in many business situations.	2000-05-25

To help get an idea of what being a manufacturing  engineer involves, prospective students should envision a dose of intense  team &amp; individual industry-based change projects, and striving globally  competitive companies to add \\"seasoning\\" to these books.  The broad  `technology' contents are useful for industry veterans, consultants, and  undergraduate students alike, as well as being a good starting point for  researchers.<br />Over 1000 pages of richly detailed and illustrated yet  concise contents span:<br />* materials properties- metals, behaviour &amp;  testing, properties, alloys, production of steels, non-ferrous production,  plastics, ceramics, and composites.<br />* metal casting processes and  equipment- fundamentals, processes, and design &amp; economics.<br />*forming  and shaping processes and equipment- rolling, forging, extrusion and  drawing, sheet-metal forming, powder metallurgy, forming &amp; shaping  plastic &amp; composites, forming &amp; shaping ceramics &amp; glass.<br />*  material removal processes and machines- cutting, tolls &amp; fluids,  round-shape processes, various-shape processes, machine tools and  economics, abrasive processes &amp; operations, and non-traditional  processes.<br />* joining processes and equipment- oxyfuel &amp; arc &amp;  resistance welding, solid-state welding, metallurgy, brazing/soldering  &amp; mechanical joining processes.<br />* surface technology- characteristics  &amp; measurement, tribology, surface treatment, fabrication of  microelectronics,<br />* common aspects of manufacturing- metrology, testing  and quality assurance, human factors and safety.<br />* manufacturing in a  competitive environment- automation, integrated systems, competition and  economics.<br />Thestrengths include the vast amount of detail,  illustrations, references and exercises to embed learning; broadness yet  correctness of content; and many examples of industrial application and  usefulness for industry. An updated version, with further additions on  latest technologies, process control, and systems analysis/simulation &amp;  change management, would address the only weakness of the text (the section  on competitive environment manufacturing). Thoroughly recommended as a  reference and how-to book in manufacturing (suspect latest version even  better!)<br />[Refers to first edition 1989 ISBN 0201128497]	2000-05-25

I felt the section  addressing cybernetic organisations should have come much sooner, with more  depth (Stafford Beer has much to offer here)- which could itself strengthen  the EQ framework, which arguably lacks both direction and performance  benchmarking. Further gaps included lack of mention of emotional dissonance  when talking about managing emotions in staff, and lack of mention of  artificial neural networks when discussing intuition and (non-linear)  pattern matching (including emotions or states).<br />Overall, an interesting  book that read somewhat like someone defending a lucrative territory of  consulting and training programmes, from those joining the bandwagon later.  There's definitely much substance, but not presented in a way immediately  useful for typical consultants, business executives or researchers. Use  with a good industrial psychology change text, to add value to your  organisation or clients.	2000-05-12

A  book you can read cover to cover, or dip into a section for reference. Much  of the approach is now included in Rational's UML - so the book still has  value for business and software development.<br />Criticisms include the lack  of more fully worked examples, and the lack of checklists (although chapter  summaries are good). <br />Overall a great intermediate-level text (not  introductory nor complete enough to be expert) for software developers,  engineers, and business information systems consultants.	2000-05-11

The only  complaint, is that because of the broad and deep coverage beyond  traditional marketing, newer breaking ideas are not covered. <br />Overall  highly recommended, particularly with a slimmer latest \\"fad\\" business/  technology/ marketing book to confirm that you are not missing anything  that may add value to your organisation or clients.<br />[Refers to European  Edition ISBN 0131659030 by Kotler, Armstrong, Saunders, Wong 1996 ]	2000-05-11

This book also proved useful in  teaching masters engineering students about html &amp; cgi basics, for use  in developing intranet demonstrators in industry.<br />The key strength is  that you understand the basics without relying on packages like Frontpage  or Office2000 to &quot;bloat&quot; up webpages unnecessarily. Overall a  good basic text and web building block, to be read with something like  &quot;Futurize Your Enterprize&quot; by David Siegel to inspire passion in  web-pure-play businesses.	2000-05-02

Also,  as reference for office, workplace &amp; VDU &quot;quick win&quot; change  projects.<br />The contents span: muscular work, nervous control of movements,  improving work efficiency, body size, design of workstations, heavy work,  handling loads, skilled work, human-machine systems, mental activity,  fatigue, occupational stress, boredom, job design to avoid monotonous  tasks, working hours and eating habits, night work and shift work, vision,  ergonomic principles of lighting, noise and vibration, indoor climate,   daylight, colours, and music for a pleasant work environment. <br />Key  strengths are the attractive style &amp; use of charts/illustrations,  comprehensive supported  content, solid biological/physiological science,  and sheer usefulness of the material to make small or large improvments in  the workplace. This is a very worthwhile purchase for any manager,  consultant or student interested in enhancing productivity whilst taking a  &quot;human-centred&quot; approach. Recommended highly.	2000-04-28

Note that IBM's famous FUD-factor  for business development  (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) has been renamed  FDU...<br />* E-commerce channels to generate profitable revenues- business  lifecycles, e-banking, and enabling technologies.<br />* Structured  transformations through e-commerce- manufacturing, societies and  governments, business sites, extending market reach, financial industries,  and crossing boundaries. Note the interesting provocation bumper sticker-  Internet for (US) President- extrapolate and think globally what could be  saved in costs and greater effectiveness in having full e-governments!<br />*  Global segmentation- customer relationships, e-business solutions,  automotive solutions, e-business value chain, and supply chain.<br />* Unique  management and organizational challenges- e-insurance, security and  privacy, extended enterprise, and conclusion.<br />Strengths include: <br />* The  14 charts and tables that capture current e-commerce issues (e.g. Figure  9.2- open finance distribution; 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 - scope and stages in  e-commerce transformation; 10.5, 10.6 on e-business transformation; 11.3-  supply chain; 12.1- 20-step Website useability test; 12.2 - profitability  vs effectiveness balance; 13.2,13.3,13.4- virtual business &amp; value  chain strategies; 15.7- e-business growth; 20.1- macro-business supply  chain). <br />* The relatively interesting and engaging style.<br />* The global  viewpoint (references to UN, EDC, ISO, European innovations as well as the  usual well-publicized US success stories).<br />* The attempt to provide case  studies spanning financial services, manufacturing, and non-profit sectors.  <br />* A few  highspots of content (e.g. 10 metrics for web design-  correctness, efficiency, flexibility, integrity, interoperability,  maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, and testability;  E-commerce designer challenges- context-sensitive GUI, multilingual,  monetary &amp; taxation compliance, security &amp; privacy, and  personalised e-marketing; discussion on EDI versus extranets (pp.60);  discussion on Internet electronic bill presentation and payment  (pp.155-163); and an example of aerospace's global lead in use of IT  through the Boeing PART system (pp.173-178)). <br />Weaknesses include: the  extreme repetition (probably 35% of book could be cut without losing any  content); content often not matching titles or subheadings; piecemeal  snapshot rather than integrated change framework structure (i.e. could not  use book alone to support e-commerce initiatives); lack of references and  superficial further reading list, supporting assertions (apart from  throwaway compilation of 78 e-mail press releases over last 2 years);  incompletely labeled &amp; repeated figures; throwaway (i.e. not  used/elaborated on) figures; multiple repeated definitions of terms  throughout text; inconsistent statistics cited (e.g. web users, projected  various web revenues); use of dated projections without reference to more  current actual values; lack of depth on research &amp; e-societies (as well  as other sections); lack of definition of terms and bandying of jargon  incorrectly used (e.g. business intelligence); occasional typos; the  relative lack of website references; the seemingly continual IBM-sales  pitch; non-optimal use of figures, tables, sidebars, and text to  communicate content; and the ultimate lack of significant contribution or  value-add for the target audience. <br />Overall, this reviewer expected  better quality and content from a Prentice-Hall text- `Exploring  E-commerce' could have done with addition of more value-add content, and a  final thorough editing &amp; proof-read prior to publication. Despite that,  it is a worthwhile introductory E-commerce text for engineering or business  undergraduate students, industrialists/business professionals, or  consultants.	2000-04-24

Alternatively, vast FMCGs companies like Procter  &amp; Gamble tend towards overcapacity and many owned manufacturing  facilities worldwide. Ernst &amp; Young (Supercharging Supply Chains ISBN  0471254371) suggest global optimisation of distribution networks (and watch  out for tax!). \\"Developing a Make vs Buy..\\" has less to say on the external  debate, but much to contribute to the practical assessment of your own  operations<br />Topics include: introduction, manufacturing business context,  strategic review, developing a make vs buy strategy, implementing &amp;  maintaining a strategy, practical experiences, useful tools &amp;  techniques, and next steps.<br />This 132 page book is concise, well presented  with illustrations, checklists, and references and should prove useful  supporting strategic product portfolio analysis/change projects.

Beyond that, is the  demonstration of the engineering approach to systems development in complex  environments (e.g. business) that has a far wider application.<br />Topics  addressed include: the fundamentals, robot technology (control systems and  components, robot motion analysis and control, robot end-effectors, sensors  in robotics, and machine vision), robot programming and languages  (including an introduction to AI), applications engineering for  manufacturing (robot cell design and control, and economic analysis for  robotics), robot applications in manufacturing (material transfer and  machine loading/unloading, processing operations, assembly and inspection),  implementation principles and issues (including safety, training,  maintenance and quality), and social issues and the future of robotics.<br />I  suspect that a more recent revised version (if available), would be a  similarly useful treatment of the subject.	2000-03-30

Beyond the  initially intimidating title, this book is of real use to researchers  addressing complex problems, and those trying to use neural networks.  Without resorting to hardwired neural networks, or MATLAB with neural  networks toolbox, one can readily understand and use the included (dated  now) C++ neural network code (C compiler excluded- but use  Borland/Microsoft). <br />The basic neural network steps include: model  process (e.g. manufacturing), gather data, pre-process data, compile, link  &amp; run the neural network code, let it iterate &amp; learn, analyse  output data sets, then use to hard-code a PID-controller (say). Even a  486-66/Win3.1/16MB RAM CPU can readily handle 25 variable/1000+ data point  (pultrusion) manufacturing process (1994). As I often tend to use fuzzy-pre  processing, and C/C++ for hacking demonstrators, the combined treatment of  fuzzy logic, C++ and neural networks works very well.<br />Topics include:  fuzzy logic introduction, constructing a neural network, C++ and object  orientation, models and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), learning, self  organization &amp; resonance, backpropogation and non-linear optimization,  Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM), Fuzzy Associative Memory (FAM), and  applications for financial modelling.<br />Weaknesses include: the now dated  and programming-novice unfriendly software, and the ultimately limited  software- far better when you are experienced to use MATLAB with neural  networks toolbox for developing fast, usable networks.<br />Overall, the style  is approachable, and the content readily understandable and usable by the  typical professional engineer/graduate engineering student audience. This  book includes much helpful annotated pseudo-code, examples, references,  definedterms, and mathematical explanations.	2000-03-30

Use with a deeper operations text  like Slack or Wild (with wide, referenced, rigorous toolsets), as well as  supply-chain vendor specifics (standards/professional organisations, tools,  and methodologies) to actually achieve business change. Clients beware-  extracts from Supercharging charts and tables could be used by unscrupulous  consultants to sell supply-chain engagements!	2000-03-27

Aimed mainly at MBA students,  this book is suitable for a much wider audience including consultants and  business managers.<br />The management models are represented by: figures,  main principle, assumptions, elements, issues, applications, related  models, and main references. The models cover:<br />* Accounting/economics -  break-even, supply &amp; demand, economics of scale, elasticity, financial  ratios, internal rate of return, net present value, and variance  analysis.<br />* Business strategy - barriers and profitability, BCG matrix,  contrasting characteristics of upstream/ downstream companies, five forces,  five Ps for strategy, four routes to strategic advantage, generic  strategies, Geobusiness model, PESTLIED, Porter's diamond, related  diversification grid, and strategic triangle<br />* Human resources-  action-centred leadership, Belbin's team roles, group development,  Herzberg's Motivator- Hygiene theory, job characteristics, managerial grid,  Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and situational leadership.<br />* Organizational  strategy- company position/industry attractiveness screen, cultural web,  dynamics of paradigm change, four organizational cultures, integrated model  of strategic management, MOST, network analysis (PERT/CPA), organic versus  mechanistic management styles, patterns of strategic change, resource  allocation at corporate level, the seven `S' framework, SWOT analysis, and  value chain.<br />* Strategic marketing- Ansoff's box, nine specimen  standardized strategies, PIMS competitive strategy paradigm, and product  life cycle.<br />I use this book in combination with a great World Class  manufacturing/business change management book (CSC publisher now, was  Lucas) to operationalize the use of management models in context of change  projects. Otheroperations management texts would be equally suitable  companion texts (by Wild, Slack etc..). <br />One just needs to pick a  business-fad novella at the airport for inspiration to complete the troika  of: tools (this book), application (operations management), and inspiration  required to make effective change happen!<br />Improvements to this excellent  text would be to include models on performance measurement including  balanced scorecard, and a new section on change management (data gathering  &amp; analysis, force field analysis, project management, time management,  communications, business process mapping, systems modeling, cause-effect,  QFD etc..) to enable effective standalone use on projects. Even further  improvements include: provision of PC templates for models and forms,  screenshots of commercial software tools, and a case study example showing  integrated use of some of the models (or perhaps a flowchart showing which  models to use at what stage in a project). <br />Overall, thoroughly  recommended, and invaluable for real use at work (be that consultancy,  business/industry/engineering, students, or even for a basic business  research starting point). The suggested improvements would increase  audience greatly (through scope stretch), and perhaps significantly reduce  businesses need for lower-end consultancy services.<br />[Refers to UK edition  of same book, with different title-&quot;MBA Management Models&quot;  ISBN0566081377]	2000-03-15
US	49980546	RCHU8DWP0QJXH	0312025599	851123842	The Civilized Engineer	Books	2	9	17	N	N	Repetitive, Long-Winded Engineering Nolstagia	Despite leading projects with complex dynamics between people, technology, business and strategic issues, engineers often get bad-press for being too scientific, logical and pragmatic. Civil engineer Samuel Forman's \\"The  Civilized Engineer\\" is aimed at both those observing and commenting  externally on engineering, and the practicing engineer- to reveal something  of the art behind great engineering achievements, and to stimulate debate  upon the author's (1987) hypothesis- that \\"in its moment of ascendance,  engineering is faced with the trivialization of its purpose and the  debasement of its practice.\\"<br />The book meanders around a wide range of  related subjects including: heritage from classical times, ethics,  teamworking, rewards, public perceptions, electronic future and publishing,  risk analysis and decision making, and the characteristics of the civilized  engineer (i.e. concept, people, schooling, women, and change).<br />From  Plato's time engineers have been labeled inferior (and artists superior), a  tradition carried through the ancient European universities including  Oxford and Cambridge in the UK, imported to US universities, and maintained  to this day. This is despite the fact that from the fall of Rome  onwards,  societal/empire/superpower collapses have been caused by politics and  lethargy rather than by the balanced use of technology to solve problems.  Organization's supporting the professionalism of engineers include: the  medieval guilds, the UK Royal Society (1660), the UK engineers institutes  (1771 onwards), military engineer training (1817 onwards), and universities  (RPI in US 1835). National differences are highlighted- the British  individual enterprising hands-on apprenticeships, the theoretical French  universities, the large-scale planned German approach, and the status-focus  of US engineering societies. Around the beginning of this century when  business schools did not exist, engineers like F.W.Taylor spread  \\"Scientific Management\\" successfully managing US industry and business.<br />Today millions of engineers across many branches of engineering work in  teams on complex projects and strive to be effective, creative,  conscientious, and ethically responsible.<br />Many engineers are driven more  by creativity, and the solving of organisational or technical problems,  rather than by great wealth or fame (despite the Silicon Valley  millionaires), leading to subjugation by the money-motivated (although dual  technical-management career ladders can compensate somewhat).<br />Forman  asserts that the media and government tend to simplify debate (about  technical-engineering) reinforcing some elitist-perspectives of  engineering, but reducing the awareness of issues and debate by the public  and often-untrained media. Computers have become central in the media and  trade publications, often without evidence of positive contribution to the  problem at hand. Ocean engineering is portrayed as an exciting area of  opportunity.<br />The account of the loss of Challenger in 1986 demonstrates  media bias in reporting decisions by \\"engineers\\" overridden by \\"managers\\"  with disastrous consequences (when in fact all parties were engineers, but  reinforcing portrayal of engineers as lower-level staff).<br />Forman asserts  that the hypothesized civilized engineer, supported by a liberal arts  education, is required to take leadership roles in future society, as \\"The  politicians, and even the statesmen, are merely scrambling to deal with the  revolutions in weapons, agriculture and industry created by the scientists  and engineers. The latter have transformed man's capacity to give life, to  sustain and prolong life, and to take life; and the politicians no longer  find that they can deal with all the new complexities and  ambiguities...\\"(J.Reston, \\"Washington, The Dull but Hopeful World of the  Future\\", New York Times Dec.13, 1964). The `reading list' for `educated  people' covering history and literature, includes: Homer, Sophocles, Plato,  Aristotle, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Austen, Wordsworth,  Dickens, Marx, Eliot, Twain, the Bible etc..<br />The debate of arts versus  (applied) science has raged for centuries and that between industry,  academia, and consulting for decades. Indeed, the March 2000 issue of Wired  magazine, includes reports on a Internet startup Harvard University student  protesting at his University's traditional Liberal arts focus, and  $billionaires in India's Bangalore-IT phenomenon (rivaling/exceeding  Silicon Valley quality at 1/20th cost) thanking the US Liberal Arts  mindset, for their business opportunities. This reviewer having worked 20  years across sectors, believes universities to excel in rigor, innovation  and creativity, industry in urgent application, and consulting in  charismatic change. Note- that all factors are required for the most  effective, creative, conscientious and ethical solution. Further, to  maintain competitive advantage and wider engineering awareness, leading  global engineering institutions (e.g. UK IEE, US IEEE) suggest engineers  should undertake structured continuing professional development which  involves reading &amp; writing papers, attending trade shows &amp; training  courses, and completion of further degrees (perhaps at intervals of a  decade, including liberal arts and generalist degrees like  MBAs).<br />Strengths of \\"The Civilized Engineer\\" include: the passion of the  debate, and wealth and breadth of supporting US information.<br />Weaknesses  include: limit of vision as the author does not reflect a wider global  community of engineers and sectors; sometimes flow would benefit from  moving text to footnotes or endnotes; the greatly reduced readibility of  the 2nd half of the book due to the lack of new material and  over-repetition of the `liberal arts mantra'; missing significant details  including Schumacher's relevant 1973  book- \\"Small is Beautiful\\"  introducing the concept of appropriate technology, sustainable development  and economics; and the lack of mention of the UK Royal Society for the  encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (1754) supporting  sustainable development and society.<br />Other more recent books in this  domain include: D.P.Billington's \\"The Innovators: The Engineering Pioneers  Who Made America Modern\\" (Wiley, 1996) presenting profiles of historical  engineering pacesetters revolutionizing US commerce, industry and history;  and E.S.Ferguson's \\"Engineering and the Mind's Eye\\" (MIT Press, 1994)  exploring the intuition and non-verbal thinking side of engineers that is  often ignored in favor of computation and equations.<br />Overall, \\"The  Civilized Engineer\\" is a welcome change from reading narrow technical  engineering, and (often) superficial business books. It's worth reading  once to summarize and feel good about being an engineer- but not worth a  re-read due to the ultimately limited and dated content.	2000-03-13
US	49980546	RXC13YC9WPM2H	0773760563	395455843	E.Con: How the Internet Undermines Democracy	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Topical Passionate Plea for Wired Democracy	Despite chapter headings related to Canada, the public sector, and the Internet, this book powerfully debates global issues on personal freedom and intellectual property rights. The Canadian Government is portrayed as  weak-willed, and often out-of their depth; and myriad arrogant US lobbying  bodies as greedy, manipulative, and protective of global empire-building US  corporations rather than the individual.<br />The books addresses: the  Connecting Canadians governmental program; the information industry's  invasion of the public library system; the secret agenda and machinations  of Canadian Government; the entry of telephone companies into the content  business; enclosing the information commons; academics building  intellectual property portfolios; IBM colonizing the education sector; the  wants of industry; and a manifesto for reclaiming public information.<br />The  Connecting Canadians 6 program goals are: to get all 16,500 schools and  3,400 libraries connected to the Internet; to promote e-commerce; to  increase Canadian content; put government information and services on the  Internet; to connect municipal governments to local residents and  businesses  (i.e. Smart Communities); and to connect Canada to the rest of  the (developed) World to attract investment. Gutstein asserts that  democracy is threatened by the Connecting Canadians knowledge-economy  theme, and Bill C-54 the Protection of Personal Information and the  Electronic Authentication Act, together aimed at minimizing the cost of  privacy violation to potential economic growth of the information industry.  <br />The information industry- computer hardware and software vendors,  telephones companies, cable companies, media/TV/newsprint companies- are  described as variously hijacking related joint public-private sector  initiatives seeking to profit from public-sector investments and  information. Publishers as a norm, now break copyright through unauthorized  electronic/database re-publishing on the Web of author's work. Land  enclosures and powerful landlords in the middles ages actually reduced  productivity innovations, and prosperity. Similarly, today Intellectual  Property Rights (IPR) landlords (e.g. Bill Gates, Disney) are building up  global empires of content, restricting freedom and increasing costs of  access to quality information. Powerful US lobbyists have pursued extra IPR  protection for US corporations in IT, pharmaceuticals, and chemical  processing as US global competitiveness in other manufacturing industries  has fallen behind Asia and Europe. Changes relating to IPR in NAFTA and  GATT/WTO in just pharmaceuticals, have cost Canadians an extra $400 million  per year since 1988. Linux is held up as an example of no-copyright high  quality `bazaar' construction with orders of magnitude greater top level  skilled development time, than `cathedral building' (i.e. fewer  high-skilled, more technicians) copyrighted unreliable Microsoft Windows.  The current commercialized Canadian university research climate discourages  basic breakthrough research, and dissemination of results through papers  (non-disclosure agreements). IBM  (and other IT vendors) are partnering  with colleges and universities to develop educatorless delivery of training  content. Through Governmental financial mis-management of interest rates  etc.. (and the resultant budget deficit), politicians have made education  and research budget cuts. This combined with the encouragement of  commercial partnerships, and `IT as salvation for growth mantra', has  resulted in promotion of production-line low-level technical skills  training (rather than analytical/higher order/adaptive intelligent/lifelong  learning as encouraged by Socrates onwards). An example is Microsoft's  outrageous policy of economic dumping of software disguised as generosity  to universities- some of which failed liked California Education Technology  Initiative, as educators and students alike wanted superior open computing  environments rather than Microsoft's offering. Supporting Government and  industry, right-wing think-tanks promote perfection of marketplace for  resource allocation and economic growth, without researched  evidence.<br />Governmental and industry communication tactics include  propaganda (`invented' by US during WW1) or changing opinions of audience  to those of originators, possibly against audience's interests; both at  grassroots level- as influencing public opinion to support business wants;  and at treetops level- reaching the leaders of society to support business  wants.<br />To combat the invasion by corporations, and reduced democratic  access to public information, and protection of our own intellectual  property Gutstein proposes: <br />* Community networks of locally -controlled  non-profit communication and information<br />* A progressive global network  e.g. include PeaceNet a computer network dedicated to peace, human rights,  and social justice<br />* A public information coalition by women's, social  justice, trade unions and organizations<br />* A charter of human rights- the  right to privacy, the right of access to information, the right of access  to information services and advice, the right to benefit from intellectual  and artistic works, and the right to communicate.<br />Overall `e.con' is  topical, well argued, structured, and supported, and frightening in it's  implications. However, it could be improved by: including a definition of  terms and acronyms, adding a few charts or summary bulleted lists,  correcting the few typos, and toning down the sometimes extreme unsupported  assertions (e.g. against the Canadian government, Bill Gates, US lobbyists,  and the information industry). Note- the cover design could expose it to a  wider audience (i.e. `geeks' and MBAs) that might not get what they are  expecting- an Internet and society easy-to-read overview book.	2000-03-13

Unfortunately, the author's repetitive, colloquial, movie-script style (and  lack of technical and management knowledge about the projects described)  reduces the faith in the validity of their message, and makes it more  difficult to learn anything of substance.<br />The book presents a range of  representative cases of unrelated consulting engagements including: <br />*  AT&amp;T's $500 million (US) consulting spending spree with McKinsey,  Monitor, and Andersen Consulting featuring- a lack of defined goals, AT  &amp;T buying whatever hype/philosophy available at time, inept AT&amp;T  managers not asking right questions, and not following through with the  (occasional) worthy recommendation. <br />* Figgie International's $75 million  (US) adventure towards bankruptcy in World Class Manufacturing (WCM) with  Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Andersen Consulting and  Price Waterhouse- where despite consultants writing a book on WCM, they  didn't know what it meant (nor did the author's of this book- clue- read  1980s books by Wheelwright, Wild, Voss or Slack to find out!). These  assignments featured- consultant-driven agendaless meeting mania,  multi-million CNCs ordered without reference to Figgie's  manufacturing/design staff, and MBAs/generalist consultants on assignments  that required industrial/manufacturing specialists.<br />* Andersen  Consulting's rapid growth through technological job-cutting assignments  (some successful like Harley-Davidson) and technology-exemplars, and  occasional resultant lawsuits for failure to deliver (e.g. O'Neal Steel,  and UOP).<br />* Sears learning curve with consultants through failure and  then success- McKinsey charging megabucks for basic use of decision trees  for strategy and Boston-Matrix-like market analysis; honesty of AT Kearney  (described as rare in consulting); and new consultant hiring guidelines  (e.g. defined project goals, demonstrated skills, commitment, and  intangible feel good).<br />* Boston Consulting Group's growth into healthcare  via assignments with Deere &amp; Co and  Boeringer Mannheim- innovations  including the statistically unproven Boston Matrix for market analysis (as  often used blindly instead of with detailed analysis), and diabetes disease  management.<br />* Gemini Consulting organizational transformation process at  Cigna and Montgomery County General- tweaking the 12 corporate change  processes (achieve mobilization, create the vision, build a measurement  system, construct an economic model, align the physical infrastructure,  redesign the work architecture, achieve market focus, invent new  businesses, change the rules through IT, create a reward structure, build  individual learning, and develop the organization) by Gemini's \\"4 Rs\\"-  reframing corporate direction, restructuring , revitalizing, and renewing  people.<br />* Bain &amp; Co's extremely close relationship with Guinness PLC  during it's takeover of Distillers leading to lawsuits against Bain, and  prison sentences for the clients due to evidence presented by Bain. Bain's  strength at data gathering, and weaknesses at interpretation &amp;  implementation are described. <br />* McKinsey's network, and focus on access  to the ear of CEOs (often ex-McKinsey consultants) , and consultants with  boldness, character, and intellectual vigor and a tendency to be honest  with clients.<br />Based on these cases, it finishes with a proposed hiring  checklist for successful engagements:  1. Define goals  2. Consider hiring  an MBA directly (or an industrial engineer for someone with deeper  technological AND business skills) full-time rather than pay expensive  consulting fees 3. Demand consultants with relevant expertise 4. Demand  specific rather than open-ended contracts 5. Retain control of assignment  6. If unhappy with progress, demand rectifying action 7. Insist on bespoke  rather than generic assignments; if buying from a book-methodology ask for  the author to be on project 8. Value employees and keep morale high 9.  Critically monitor consulting engagement progress 10. Only use consulting  to address critical problems/ bottlenecks.<br />Other points presented  include:  <br />* The lack of standards for consultant ethics despite  existence of professional organizations (e.g. CMA, IOD, IAM, IEEE, RSA, IEE  etc..).<br />* The marketing approach of consulting- newsletter/journal  publishing, trade papers in the popular generalist Harvard Business Review,  CEO conferences, publications of new-fad business books, \\"think tanks\\",  press releases of successful projects, and out-of-court settlements for  lawsuits.<br />* The partners, project managers, and consultants pyramid of  fees and staff encourages the use of many young (arrogant) MBAs on  assignments to maximize consultancy profitability.<br />* James O Mckinsey,  the \\"father\\" of US consulting stating in the 1930's that `businesses do not  need action-men but scientific planners' (ironic that today most  consultants are charismatic action-people rather than knowledgeable expert  analysts).<br />Strengths of `Dangerous Company' are that it is a genuinely  easy-to-read book, presenting business and historical context for the US  consulting industry, and offering a good selection of representative cases.  <br />Weaknesses include: the repetitive, colloquial, cliché-ridden,  movie-script style; long length of book for content; needs a list of  defined of acronyms; authors demonstrate clear lack of knowledge about  subject matter; superficiality of supposed \\"analysis\\"; 50%+ of book could  be better communicated through charts, illustrations, tables or sidebars  (but perhaps that would be too much like the MBA/Consulting  presentation-style for the authors?); and the US-bias in a much larger  global industry and marketplace<br />Overall, despitethe weaknesses,  recommended reading for consultants, clients and interested parties  particularly for balance against business-fad consultancy books. `Dangerous  Company' also offers between-the-lines guidance for those wanting to  start-up a (better) consulting firm.	2000-03-13

Finally, the prediction section presents an attractive automated, less bureaucratic view of the future through the eyes of different prospective the moviegoer, the frequent flier, the student, the lawyer, the patient, and the reputation consultant.<br />A particularly powerful scenario is that of the universal personal web site that everyone will have in 2010 (even the less-Web connected developing countries), which contains information in 7 areas at 6 security levels facilitating streamlined completion of all manner of business and personal matters through timely integration Worldwide of relevant information sources and sinks, and autonomous active acquaintance/colleague, friends/family, spouse, and self. The subject haves, and wants. Such a site supports medical emergency response, organising loans and mortgages, buying and selling goods, voting governments, and almost every transaction that nowadays involves many different systems, bottlenecks, and delays.<br />A key strength of FYE is that it successfully presents both a basic framework (e.g. background, action steps, prototyping, and customer scenarios) at a level detailed and exciting enough to proceed towards implementation with.<br />FYE is readable, enthusiastic in tone, relatively complete in vision, supported by anecdotal evidence and reason, well presented with charts and illustrations, and is delivered at an appropriate level for the generalist business/technology audience- truly enough to make you want to start energising your current workplace and setup &quot;pure-play&quot; web-based lateness of the heavily promoted companion web-site; gaps in the 'strategic futurising tools' (the basis is narrative with customers and little else); and the lack of support (either by reference, or full logical reasoning) for many assertions made which all reduce the book's credibility- would you commit your company's future on the basis of a 'glossy brainstorm'?<br />Three How to Create a Profitable Business Strategy for the Internet and Beyond&quot; by Seybold et al (1998) which identifies 5 key steps in success in e-commerce, using16 case studies and summarising current best practice. * &quot;Enterprise.Com- Market leadership in the Information Age&quot; by Lotus CEO Papows et al (1998) which examines the way organisations, market, the nature of competition, and global society are driven by advances in technology, including IT. *&quot;Net Gain- Expanding Markets Through Virtual Communities&quot; by Hagel/Armstrong (1997) proposing that future business success will depend on using the Internet to build communities (not just relationships) leading to phenomenal customer loyalty and high profits.<br />Overall, the reviewer recommends FYE as a suitable text to help quickly build up a positive picture of possible future web-enabled business and society scenarios. FYE is very suitable as a companion to one of the many change or operations management texts, which include a wide range of rigororus detailed methodologies supporting change towards &quot;the customer-led Web revolution&quot;.

US	49980546	R1F3POHYXJW3QV	1574442716	506654165	3c: A Proven Alternative to MRPII for Optimizing Supply Chain Performance	Books	4	40	42	N	N	Contemporary MRP alternative for supply chain optimisation	This slim volume is suitable for a wide audience including  manufacturing/industrial students, MBAs as well as industrialists and  consultants.<br />The basic problem is that MRP2 at the heart of ERP  implementations cannot cope with inaccurate forecasts, is unecessarily  complex, does not  deliver promised benefits, leaving high caliber  manufacturing schedulers manually cancelling reams of wrong computer  purchase orders.<br />The solution 3C (inspired partly by kitchen operations)  focusses on capacity as a constraint, commonality of BOMS, and consumption  of stocks for re-order to achieve impressively supported results of doubled  stockturns, slashed costs, 100% customer delivery performance and reduced  WIP and inventory levels. This is despite there being a requirement for  stocks for 100% production of all products.<br />The theory, analyses, case  studies, data and independent support from Stanford University lead to the  conclusion that there is merit in the 3C approach to optimising supply  quality charts and figures, tighter support of anecdotal arguments, more  contemporary business context (e.g. the web and e-commerce, postponement  and mass-customisation, globalisation, cyber manufacturing, strategic  dimensions etc..), and more on how to actually implement the  approach.<br />Overall the book is topical, approachable in style, with good  content likely to trigger critical thought on manufacturing operations and  supply chains.	1999-10-28
