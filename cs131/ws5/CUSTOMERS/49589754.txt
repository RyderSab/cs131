The dishes are beautifully photographed.  Note that there isn't a photograph of each one, but the ones that are pictured are chosen wisely.  For example, it helps to have a photo of Lobster Clarence, since the presentation of that dish is essential, and quite impressive, if done well.  <br />I have cooked a lot of the recipes in this book, with great success.  I think, however, that the strength of this book is in the entrees.  These recipes are definitely the most fun for me, and the variety is wonderful, including fish, shellfish, meats, game, and half a dozen ways of doing tournedos.  Whether you are daydreaming gourmet dinners, or planning an upcoming meal to remember, you'll find the perfect entree.<br />The soups and desserts are pretty much typical of French Classic cooking; the vegetable dishes are a bit more interesting and diverse.  All seem well-chosen to accompany the entrees.  <br />One of the things I like about Escoffier is the freedom he gives you to adapt the recipes to your own needs &amp; interests.  Each recipe gives you all that you need to know to make the dish as written, but in many of them (e.g., Pork Roast a la Paysanne) there is room to add your own touches.  The book is well organized, and you'll find the glossary quite useful.<br />Bon appetit!	2002-03-11
US	49589754	RN70BZFE196X9	051512608X	950568892	The Reef	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Ok Plot, but some issues	At the outset, let me say that I really did enjoy the read, for the most part.  The treasure-hunting/suspense/romance combo comes off pretty successfully.  The Reef is a fun read, and you'll like Roberts' vivid, mostly apt, and occassionally witty descriptions.<br />However, there are two flaws.  The first is the motivation of Silas Van Dyke.  Yeah, the guy's evil, greedy, and psychotic.  We get that from the temper tantrums and megalomaniacal musings.  What we don't get is any sense of \\"why?\\"  In other words, instead of chasing the Lassiter/Beaumont folks, why the heck isn't he, say, the head of a crime family or assassinating world leaders?  <br />I suppose his raison d'etre is his fancied (but vaguely and belatedly described) connection to the amulet itself, but that's pretty weak.  There is nothing in the description or action that explain how Van Dyke's passion for the amulet dovetails with his basic evilness.  The lack of connection didn't confuse me, but it did make me feel that a piece of the puzzle was missing.  This missing piece needed to be there all along; tossing it in at the end won't do it - too deus ex machina.<br />The second flaw is editorial.  My favorite example is when Matthew dives to do \\"recognizance.\\"  Uh, no.  What Matthew is doing is reconnaisance, a completely different concept.  I forgive Nora.  It's easy to confuse words that sound similar, and I haven't seen any gaffes like this in subsequent novels.  The person to blame is the editor.  As an editor myself, I am actually appalled that s/he let this one slip.  To someone who is supposed to know words, 'recognizance' an obvious error.	2002-02-28

The repeat was a bit disconcerting, and I would have rather seen something else, since I have almost the complete Vogue Knitting library.<br />However, the book has many, many excellent points, which make it a worthwhile purchase, even if you've seen a few of the patterns before.  First, Vintage Collection is designed very well, with all of VKs usual features and inspiring photographs.  Patterns are grouped by type: women, men, kids, and scarves/shawls.  Unlike VK's Vintage Knits On the Go, the Collection contains patterns that truly speak for their era and will lend a vintage touch to everyone's wardrobe.<br />The variety of designs is astounding, including a coat, an aran sweater, the gorgeous cashmere cabled sweater on the cover, sweet baby things, as well as a silk lined shawl... and many, many more.	2002-01-17

I was amazed at the variety of projects - sweaters, one suitable for your favorite guy (or for you!), a wrap, and my personal fave, the cabled cashmere hat.<br />Knitting with bulky yarns is, by definition, fast... but the results are not always fabulous.  Unfortunately, many of them scream &quot;THIS WAS EASY TO KNIT!&quot;  However, this book is a breath of fresh air.  The sleeveless turtlenecks, for example, are sleek and fashionable due to Mari Lynn Patrick's famed shaping techniques and yarn choices.  These designs will work up quickly, but look lovely.  They will be fun to knit for both beginners and more experienced knitters.<br />Similarly, you'll find some fun stitchwork and colorwork in many of the other projects, including the cashmere hat, and an argyle vest. You're sure to finish these projects in a minimum of time, but everyone will think you slaved over them.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who are looking to experiment with some of the new Chunky-weight yarns.<br /><br />As always, this latest edition to the On the Go series is portable, well-designed, with easy to follow charts and instructions.	2002-01-04

While the blurb on the back sounded promising, I expected another post-Bridget Jones funny-yet-predictable novel.<br />I bought it anyway, and was pleasantly surprised to find a well-written, fast-paced, and truly hilarious novel about a heroine I could really relate to. The book's tone is conversational, as if Sophy is your best girlfriend, and you're dishing over a couple of vodkas; as a result, I liked her and found myself waiting anxiously for the next plot twist to unfold.<br />Even though Sophy's white lie(s) spin(s) wildly out of control, I didn't think the plot and its many twists were at all contrived or predictable. Sophy's character rang quite true to me, as did everyone else's. <br />In the ever-expanding universe of contemporary women's fiction, I think this book is a breath of fresh air. While Sophy is no less charmingly neurotic than Bridget and her &quot;sisters,&quot; I feel that Sophy's character is deeper, a bit more developed, less breezy, and, as a result, more human. She acknowledges, and agonizes, over her faults, and seems to grow as a person through her experiences.<br />The characters' relationships strike me as more complex and authentic than other novels, perhaps because of Ms. Young's attention to detail in crafting their mannerisms, speech, etc. She also creates a sense of history, in describing events and people from Sophy's childhood, which are traced to the present. <BR>Finally, the situations, dialogue and descriptions are often so unexpectedly funny that I laughed until I cried. I could not put this book down. You'll love it, too.	2001-09-20

All of them are simply beautiful, from the basic throws and pillows, to a unique basket and bag for the bath.  More than many other books, I think this one wants you to take the ideas of the patterns and run with them.  You could make them exactly as they appear, or you could substitute yarns, stitches, needles, etc. for a totally new look.  <br />The best example of this approach may well be the rag rug.  The possibilities are limitless, using a mixture of cotton and chenille yarns, hemp, fabric strips - whatever you have stashed away that strikes your fancy.<br />While all of this 'go with the flow' uniqueness is fun, it would still be helpful to have a bit more of the traditional knitting book here.  Gauges are given, but in the back of the book.  The gauge really ought to be with each pattern, so you don't have to hunt for it and refer back.  Also, several of the yarns used are no longer available or hard to find.  Suggested substitutes (like Vogue Knitting's excellent books) might have been in order.<br />The designs in this book all have a modern, yet classic, aesthetic that will fit well in just about anyone's home.  You'll be making things for yourself, as well as for a much-loved gift.  Think weddings and housewarmings, as well as the holidays.<br />As a final note, the designs are presented in lush photographs and an accessible layout (apart from the gauge thing).	2001-09-17

Celtic Knits has a pretty good variety of patterns - mostly adults, but also a few child and baby patterns.  Be warned, however, that the women's patterns seem to run on the small side; you might have to adapt if you want to make other sizes.<br />Unfortunately, many of the patterns seem either (a) like a great many other patterns you've seen lately, or (b) nice, but not particularly Celtic.  I think the theory is that the colors used in the designs are supposed to have a Celtic 'mood,' but I just don't see it.  Debbie Bliss' usual creative spark seems somewhat absent from this book.<br />The one pattern that really stands out is the Aran long-line tunic.  This sweater, to me, at least, strikes a charming balance between traditional Aran knitting and a contemporary feel.  The color, a sort of mauve-y rose, and the long shaping combine for a feminine, cuddly appeal.<br />With few other exceptions, the rest of the designs are unremarkable, if elegant and beautifully made.  They would be perfectly at home under any title other than Celtic Knits.  In sum, if you're looking for unique Aran and Fair Isle designs, there are better resources out there (e.g., Alice Starmore).	2001-09-17

I was amazed at all the variety packed into this little book!  Scarves make fabulous gifts, and you'll find something here for everyone on your list.  The designs are unique, whether it's the simplest scarf, or the most complicated shawl.<br />While it's true that some of the patterns call for high-end yarns, don't let that stop you from buying this book;  scarves are definitely good for experimenting with different yarns.  Even size and gauge aren't critical, so feel free to substitute yarns, as I have done with much success.  That said, scarves don't take that much yarn, and it's worth a little extra money to make one of the knock-out scarves calling for hand-dyed yarns.<br />The patterns range from simple stitches to intricate colorwork, and everything in between.  As a result, you'll find quick-knit gift items, as well as good things to try when you're finally ready to tackle intarsia or fair isle.  It's also not just scarves - there's a gorgeous intarsia shawl, and a lace wrap, too.  Finishing includes fringes, pom-poms, and even rose quartz beads!  <br />With the great variety and possibilities for experimentation, this book is a great value for the money.	2001-09-07

Starting with the good points, the Vogue Knitting folks continue to provide easy-to-follow instructions, great photographs and some cute projects. However, I was disappointed with the lack of variety. I was hoping to find gorgeous angora twinsets, jewelneck pullovers, etc., but most of the patterns were for kids and babies; not much help if you want vintage items for adults. Even though the patterns were cute, nothing really leapt out at me, as if to say &quot;you have to make this next!&quot; Similarly, none of the items struck me as being from a particular era, more of a generic late 50s-early 60s style redux. There was a lot of knitting going on before and after this period, and it would have been nice to have a sampling that spanned a bit more time. I think an expanded &quot;Vintage Knits&quot; would be better suited to one of VK's big collections, rather than an &quot;On the Go&quot; format. In short, pick this one up for kid's things, but if you are expecting a variety of truly vintage patterns, or want to make vintage knits for yourself, this probably isn't the best choice for you.	2001-08-28

The coolest part is that even the easy ones are beautiful and fun to make, and the difficult ones are not overly intimidating.  Anyway, if you're going to take the plunge into a more challenging project, why not start smaller?  <br />As always, the folks at Vogue Knitting provide clear instructions, helpful charts, and chic-yet-timeless designs.  My favorite project is the last one - the houndstooth mittens using Colinette's mohair.  They are stunning, and not as difficult as you might fear.  This is a great way to sample high-end yarns without breaking the bank.  <br />The book is quite portable, but I would still suggest making a copy of the pattern to carry with you.  <br />One caution - if you're interested in making items for men, there are really only two suitable patterns - gorgeous cashmere gloves, or split-finger mittens (i.e., a separate index finger).	2001-08-09

Like all of Debbie Bliss' books, the Workbook takes you through a variety of projects to concentrate on different techniques.  Every project is simply gorgeous, and takes you from simpler/beginner projects to more advanced/difficult ones.  You'll find things for children, for yourself, and for your home.<br />You might be tempted to teach yourself from this book, but I would recommend starting with &quot;How to Knit&quot; instead, which provides an excellent step-by-step course for new knitters.  After you have worked through the basics, pick this up to help you perfect advanced techniques and embellishments.  Speaking of embellishments, the chapter on embroidery is great!  My favorite project is the embroidered jacket, made with denim yarn.  I can't wait to make it!<br />As always, Debbie Bliss provides clear instructions, beautiful photographs, and inspiration for knitters of all skill levels.   She also gives useful advice on making up and caring for knitwear, which are critical to having your work look it's best for years to come. <br />One caution to anyone interested in making plus-size garments: the women's patterns are designed in sizes 32-38 (roughly x-small through large), so you may have to adapt patterns if you wish to make other sizes.	2001-07-27
US	49589754	RUGJ2UEEHCRDN	0385496931	302329004	The Life of Thomas More	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Inspiring and Real	My interest in Thomas More began when I learned that he was the Patron Saint of Lawyers, when I as about to graduate from law school.  This book seemed to be the most realistic and comprehensive work on the life of Thomas More.  Naturally, many of the works devoted to him are much more spiritual or political in nature.  Peter Ackroyd, however, covers it all.  His discussion of More's childhood and family life provide insights into his political career and spirtuality.<br />At first glance, the contrast between More's &quot;worldly&quot; political career and his deep, sincere spirituality might seem jarring to contemporary eyes.  Ackroyd deftly points out, though, that for More's contemporaries, there really isn't a contrast.  Religion, politics, and social hierarchy were all part of the same system -- to a point.  The Life of Thomas More shows that, given the right elements (e.g., Henry the Eighth on the throne, the Protestant Reformation in full swing, More's own faith), religion and politics can (and will) clash violently.<br />Ackroyd's writing is, quite simply, wonderful.  While the material can be quite dense, Ackroyd's prose keeps you moving swiftly through the book.  Although the book is certainly well-researched and up to anyone's standards of scholarship, Ackroyd's tone is not at all distant.<br />On a more personal note, I found Thomas More's strength and faith to be very inspiring.  While few of us will become martyrs to our faith or wear a hairshirt, Thomas More's life shows that strength of character and strong faith require a lot of work, but are valuable attributes in a complicated world.	2001-07-11
US	49589754	R1C13FI7N7345Z	0440225825	43714370	Move to Strike (Nina Reilly)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Just Okay	This book starts out with a compelling premise - a young girl goes to her rich uncle's house to take back something that was rightfully hers, witnesses his murder, and may end up on trial for her life.  Unfortunately, the plot quickly unravels into several threads - the many &quot;whos&quot; who possibly &quot;dunnit.&quot;  Each thread is equally plausible, or implausible, depending on your perspective.  Evidence is thin on the ground for all of them, and the motives seem too easy/trite.   While this &quot;device&quot; keeps the reader wondering, a little competition for the prime suspect would have been nice.  Unlike many great thrillers, this book doesn't present you with someone who appears to be the most likely suspect, and then surprise you at the end with someone else, who is, in retrospect, the obvious choice.  <br />The subplot of Nina and Paul's attempted romance is a little distracting, and the stilted dialogue between them doesn't convey a sense that they are uncomfortable or wary of each other.  Rather, it suggests sloppy characterization and/or just plain bad dialogue.<br />The authors also attempt to weave in contemporary events in the descriptions and dialogue.  The one that stands out is when Nina says something about begging the D.A. on her knees, and Paul responds with something about &quot;pulling a Monica.&quot;  This struck me as both lame and dated.  It actually took me a second to get the reference.  It also made Paul look like more of a jerk than I had originally assumed (he is a reckless skirt-chaser, with few other redeeming qualities).  It's hard to understand what Nina, a widow, sees in him, making their attraction somewhat unbelievable.<br />The characterization of Nikki is okay.  I thought the authors could do better in making her rebellious-yet-wounded persona less cliched and more real.  The &quot;good band name&quot; and black fingernails schtick was a little tired.  Vivid description and more realistic dialogue would have gone a long way.	2001-07-03

I read it on a cross-country plane trip, and the hours literally flew by.  Forden traces the history of the Gucci empire from its earliest beginnings to the present day.  This history provides a context for the drama, upheaval, and legal battles that plagued the family in the 70s, 80s and 90s.  Forden weaves the personal, public, and legal aspects of these battles in a seamless, cogent, and intelligent discussion.  While it is a sensational story, Forden does a great job of getting to the facts that underly the disputes and presents them without fanfare - they speak for themselves.<br />The photographs and family tree are great additions to this book. You'll need the family tree to keep track, and the photos make the story that much more real.<br />Watching the characters' lives unfold was better than any soap opera, precisely because they are/were real people whose choices led them on a path of destruction.  Even so, Forden's prose avoids the talk-show and tabloid cliches that have ruined many a biography.<br />Finally, as an attorney, this book provided me with interesting insights into family legal battles and corporate organization.	2001-06-07

Even if you're a relatively inexperienced knitter, you should buy this book.  While it is true that most of the projects are for more advanced knitters, you need something to work toward, to look forward to.  As is true for all of Vogue Knitting's books, the pattern instructions are clearly written, and the photographs are dynamite.  At some point, you will want to try something more challenging, and when you're ready, you'll have this book.  Even so, I think several of these designs could be attempted after you have done a couple of more simple sweaters.  Just go slow at first, and don't be afraid to ask for help.<br />In addition to the beautiful designs in this book, there is a profile of each designer.  This is a great feature.  Each of the designers started out as beginners, just like us.  It's interesting to see how each of them got their start.  You might even be inspired to design something on your own.	2001-05-23

With clear, easy to follow instructions, each of the chic items in this book could be made angst-free, even if you're a relatively inexperienced knitter.  My only quarrel was that I can't find a lot of the yarns (even suggested substitutes)in my local yarn shops or even on the 'net.  Your best bet is to find something you like in the same gauge, and just be very careful about checking your gauge before you proceed.  <br />Regardless of that small, technical difficulty, you will find plenty of things to keep you busy.  I was also inspired to design some sweaters of my own, based on some of the patterns in this book (e.g., the Chanel-style cardigan).  <br />There are several patterns in here from big-name designers, including the aforementioned Marc Jacobs (designing for Perry Ellis) and Calvin Klein.  The sweaters for men are cool, too.  Unlike most menswear patterns, I think your real-life guy might actually wear these.	2001-05-17

I thought so, too, until I picked it up.  Just like Vogue Knitting, this is a comprehensive encyclopedia of knitting techniques.  It will also give you a lot of good ideas for your own designs, or to adapt existing patterns (even making sizes that aren't in the pattern).  <br />While both books are equally good, The Big Book is probably a little more user-friendly (i.e., less like a textbook), especially for those who don't like/need color coding or cross references.  Buss groups topics logically, and the book is *full* of color illustrations as well as photographs.  She also shows techniques (such as kitchener ribbing) that are not included in Vogue Knitting.  <br />One of the best features of this book is Buss' detailed discussion of making gloves and mittens.  If you have never made them before, read this before starting your pattern.  Buss gives you a breakdown of measurements, techniques and tips that will help you decipher a pattern or design your own.  She goes into similar detail for finishing techniques and designer touches (more ways to make a bobble than you can shake a stick at), which will help you make your projects look truly professional - or better.  <br />I also liked Buss' explanation of the Entrelac technique.  I think her descriptions and illustrations were easier to understand than in Debbie Bliss' &quot;How to Knit.&quot;  Buss uses photographs to show you how to create the woven look, which provided a clearer explanation than Bliss' diagrams.	2001-05-17

The diagrams clearly illustrate every technique discussed.  They accurately portray the textual descriptions, which provides a visual &quot;quick reference&quot; for each technique.  The text is engaging and easy to follow.  Bliss explains even the most complicated techniques without &quot;dumbing it down.&quot;  My only problem was that many of the projects in the course were for children.  Since I neither have nor know any kids, I actually found myself searching for easy, similar patterns as substitutes. Even so, Bliss does a great job of walking the beginning knitter through the basic skills and on to more advanced techniques.  Probably the best aspects of her book are the Aran and color-knitting (Fair Isle and Intarsia) and Entrelac workshops.  They provide me with a lot of inspiration, and something to look forward to as my skills increase.  I would also recommend this book to anyone looking to brush up on their skills, or to have around as a reference book.	2001-04-25

The illustrations and diagrams are virtually self-explanatory.  When I taught myself to knit, I used Debbie Bliss' &quot;How to Knit,&quot; but also relied on this as a supplement.  While Bliss' book is extremely helpful, I found Vogue's illustrations and descriptions to be a little more precise.  For example, I had been confused about how to bind off, until I referred to this book.  In that case, Vogue's diagram was more clear, and I proceeded with confidence.<br />The layout of this book is amazing, as well.  The Editors seem to instinctively place all the information you need at your fingertips.  Cross references on each page and color-coding of each chapter help you flip instantly to what you need to know.<br />This is not just another bland reference book.  There is a lot of inspiration to be found here, in addition to unparalleled advice, and the last word on any technique you can imagine.  One of the best features of this book is the design workshop at the back.  Nowhere have I seen a simpler, more straightforward &quot;how-to&quot; for design.  I never imagined designing until I saw their simple chart, diagrams, calculations, and advice on the subject.  Debbie Bliss' &quot;How to Knit&quot; has a design workshop, but it is more of an introduction/afterthought and doesn't really get you there as Vogue does.	2001-04-25

You might be thinking &quot;been there, done that,&quot; but Danielle Steele's story of a woman's struggle to put her life back together after her husband's death is both realistic and compassionate.  I think this book differs significantly from similar stories in that Liz and Jack's marriage is distinctly contemporary: they are partners in both marriage and business, and seem to be friends as well as lovers and parents.  We all know a couple like this, which renders the story very poignant and personal to the reader.<br />In a relatively short book, Steel is remarkably thorough in dealing with Liz's conflict over moving forward or holding on to her husband's memory.  In addition, her children push her in all directions, forcing Liz to confront the consequences to them of her new romance.  Her daughters' characters do seem a little shallow/formulaic, but, in the overall context, it works to show that putting her life back together after her husband's death (1) won't be easy, and (2) involves her kids as well.<br />Finally, the lesson of this book rings true for anyone who has ever had to deal with the loss of a family member.  While you would like to dwell in the past for just a little while longer, eventually, life has it's own rhythm and will get you moving forward somehow.  For Liz, it took another crisis before she got going again.	2001-04-20

Gaffney's writing style is straightforward and simple, which allows the characters' emotions to shine.    Gaffney does a masterful job of weaving humor, love, and tragedy into a cohesive plot, which is pretty amazing, given the fact that the characters take turns telling the story of their lives and the events that unfold.  Indeed, this structure allows the story to be more subtle, revealing the dynamics of the friendship.	2001-04-16

Her downward spiral is not only a vicarious thrill, but a lesson to shopaholics everywhere.  I both identified with Rebecca, and was relieved that I am not quite that bad.  Although Rebecca may bear some resemblance to Bridget Jones (i.e., writing career, attraction to the snobbish rich guy) Kinsella's narrower focus sets &quot;Shopaholic&quot; apart.  In addition, I think Kinsella takes her heroine's struggle a little more seriously, although there are plenty of laughs along the way (especially in Rebecca's letters from creditors).  Although everything seems to work out okay in the end for both women, I sense that Rebecca's success was more hard-won, lasting, and the result of lessons learned.	2001-04-16

US	49589754	RP5SOPTPQ0OW2	0375702024	537031843	The Man Who Ate Everything	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	Unique!	Did you know Jeffrey Steingarten was a lawyer before he became the food writer for Vogue?  That was the best news I have heard since graduating from law school - and it was a brilliant move for Steingarten, whose wit and enthusiasm make reading this book almost like a conversation with the author himself.  Steingarten's adventures in the world of food provide satisfying descriptions, great advice, and answers to questions you never knew you had.  A definite must-have for every gourmet, and lawyer who dreams of a career change.	2001-04-16

I can fit about four Chardonnay glasses on it at one time.  Call me a cynic if you must, but I submit that photojournalists in a war zone have better things to do than maunder on about their pathetic love lives.  The characters were shallow and formulaic, and I loathed the title, proving that one can, indeed, judge a book by its cover.	2001-04-16

That is why I read it; I'm not making that up.  Not a fan of censorship, but let's just say that I understand.  What would otherwise be a provocative social commentary is really just a gore/rage/mysogyny fest that left me: (1) nauseated, (2) freaked out, (3) wondering what all the fuss was about.  I mean, Ellis is quite obviously a decent writer, and had some purpose for writing this book.  I think the same theme/purpose could have been achieved without being so cavalierly mysogynist, violent, and just plain yucky.	2001-04-16

The characters' lives and problems are very real, and they confront their problems (and each other) in ways that most women will find familiar.  I actually first read this in college; young enough to be the daughter of any of the main characters.  Nevertheless, I identified with them and their struggles.  A must read for you and all your girlfriends.	2001-04-16
