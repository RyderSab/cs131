Every chapter is full of insights into Nixon and the movies. Mark Feeney takes five movies Nixon is known to have enjoyed, and wrings out all kinds of fascinating connections between the story line and Nixon's own personality. Not only politics, but culture and sex and money and ambition and pain -- this book teaches amazing lessons on everything that shaped Nixon. Don't miss the sections on Elvis and Nixon as twin icons of un-cool!<br /><br />My only complaint is that Feeney never brings Humphrey Bogart into the mix. The amazing and authentic \\"movie diary\\" at the end of the book makes it clear that Nixon screened both THE CAINE MUTINY and THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE while in the White House. Why didn't Mark Feeney jump on the SCREAMINGLY obvious ties between Nixon and Bogey?<br /><br />Look at Humphrey Bogart's face -- the mean, kicked around face of Richard Nixon. Look at the unshaved beard, the shifty, beady little eyes. Look at how every man Bogart ever played was a cold, paranoid loner at heart, often with a homicidal streak. It's much easier for me to see Nixon as the vicious small time prospector Fred C. Dobbs (in TREASURE) or as the frightened, incompetent naval officer Philip Queeg (in CAINE) than as the smooth, sexually confident insurance salesman played by Fred MacMurray in DOUBLE INDEMNITY.<br /><br />Note how Fred C. Dobbs is convinced everyone is after him. Note how he's capable of holding on to sanity -- just barely -- until he finally strikes it rich. The fact of finally having gold is what makes him lose his fragile grip on reality -- just the way Nixon survived years of political exile but cracked up the moment all his dreams were within his grasp. By turning on his buddies in bandit country, Dobbs ensures his own downfall systematically. He commits all the most horrifying acts of betrayal, but in his tortured mind it's always a matter of self-preservation. (\\"No, not murder, partner, not murder, your mistake! I'm saving my life that you'd be taking from me!\\")Sound familiar?<br /><br />And how could Feeney have skipped writing a chapter on Bogart's role as Commander Philip Queeg in THE CAINE MUTINY? Nixon is so obviously Queeg it's like the movie was an eerie prophecy. Queeg is a weak, shifty eyed nervous wreck pathetically masquerading as a heroic military commander. Queeg knows he's not the John Wayne type. And he knows his officers know it. He constantly feels menaced by \\"disloyal officers\\" and insists \\"from the first they were all against me.\\" Queeg routinely lies and cheats in order to avoid taking responsibility for his own ineptness as a commander. (\\"Take the towline . . . defective equipment . . . nothing more!\\")Queeg longs to rouse and inspire with his speeches, but his attempts at frank man to man talk are pathetically hollow. (\\"I kid you not.\\")THE CAINE MUTINY is the best movie ever made about Watergate.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart would have been the most logical choice to play Nixon in a major motion picture. He understood Nixon and acted out his tragedy back when Nixon himself was just a young congressman from California. How did the brilliant Mark Feeney miss the Bogart connection?ake!

You should skip it and go right on to the second book in the series, BIRDS OF A FEATHER. It has a much better mystery.<br /><br />This book contains barely any mystery at all. Once Maisie goes after the sinister man running the Retreat, the pieces come together with laughable ease. And you will not believe the big musical \\"finale\\" where the power of song converts the villain into a big, blubbering baby. I mean, really! Charlie Manson was a big Beatles fan, but if his victims had burst into a chorus of \\"Yellow Submarine\\" he probably just would have rolled his eyes and kept right on stabbing away.<br /><br />What saves Winspear as a writer is just that her characters are so wonderful and kind. I wanted to hear so much more about Priscilla, Maisie's sexy and fun-loving girl friend from Oxford. She should have a novel of her own, or at least be reunited with Maisie for a big mystery! And I think it was a mistake to keep mentioning Lady Rowan's son James, and all his \\"problems\\" and never allow the man to speak for himself. Bring him back too!<br /><br />BIRDS OF A FEATHER tells you everything you need to know about Maisie Dobbs. Begin there!	2005-07-28

Nor is originality. Just about every character and plot device in this novel has been used before -- many, many times before. Oddly, for a hell-on-wheels nagging feminista, Anna Quindlen seems unduly influenced by male authors (and cliches.) She steals much, but understands little.<br /><br />Let's see, a family saga about a wealthy immigrant clan ruled by a shady, all-powerful patriarch. GODFATHER, anyone? Just as John Scanlan is clearly Don Vito, so is uber-achiever teen girl Maggie Scanlan clearly in the Michael Corleone position. She's all but anointed as his successor -- at thirteen! The only problem is, all the tough moral questions Michael Corleone has to face are carefully airbrushed away for Maggie. The old man is a brute, a bully, and all the usual feminist crybaby stuff -- but it's perfectly all right for Maggie dearest to inherit all that yummy money.<br /><br />On the other hand, this book also owes a surprising debt to TOM SAWYER. Tom Sawyer and Maggie Scanlan are both the smartest, liveliest, most charismatic kids in the neighborhood. Both are surrounded by dumb, weak-willed sidekicks who exist only to make them look good. Maggie has the blandly obnoxious Debbie Malone, and Tom has Ben Rogers, Joe Harper, and -- dare I say it -- future hero Huck Finn. Tom Sawyer and Maggie Scanlan are both expected to have brilliant futures, if they don't drown, burn, or blow themselves up in the process of having their amazing but never truly subversive teen adventures.<br /><br />The most interesting TOM SAYWER parallel is in the use of the hero's nemesis or arch-enemy. Tom has Injun Joe, and Maggie has her cousin Monica Scanlan. At first glance a vicious murdering half-breed and a luscious Grace Kelly lookalike might not seem to have much in common. But it seems that compassionate feminista Anna Quindlen hates blondes even worse than Mark Twain hated Indians -- she's just less honest about what she feels!<br /><br />Look at all the amazing similarities. Injun Joe and Monica both torture the hero in secret, when no one can see them. Both are masters of disguise. Both meet horrible fates that the heroes don't create but -- oh, so sorry! -- don't manage to prevent on time. There's a certain have it both ways hypocrisy in both novels. Twain claims to present America as a land of innocence and hope -- only the Indians have got to go. Anna claims that Maggie and her luscious college girl mentor Helen are going to build \\"A New World\\" for all women  -- but first the blondes have got to go the way of the Indians. Ah, Sisterhood!<br /><br />This tiresome business of bashing beautiful women goes back a long, long way in feminist literature. Poor Monica Scanlan is in good company, along with Hetty Sorrel, Rosamund Vincy, and Lucy Deane. (You can look up these fascinating ladies in the novels of George Eliot -- better yet, don't bother.) It's good to know that, like the nobility of the Bourbon restoration, the feminists of today have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.<br /><br />Did I mention that the budding romance between Maggie and her shy boyfriend Bruce is handled with unusual skill and sensitivity? It's the best part of the book by far. Anna Quindlen has missed her calling -- she should be writing YA romance!<br /><br />But of course, that sort of novel would be beneath a Barnard graduate.s!<br /><br />Look at all the amazing similarities.

It's UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS meets THE BIG LEBOWSKI, with just a touch of KUNG FU!<br /><br />I really adore the Maisie Dobbs books, and I'm the type of person who usually can't stand cosy English mysteries with intrepid lady sleuths. But there has never been a sleuth quite like Maisie Dobbs. Imagine Rose from Upstairs Downstairs, brave and loyal to a fault, only with the precocious intellect of Matt Damon in GOOD WILL HUNTING, and the mystical training of Caine in KUNG FU. Maisie Dobbs has only one flaw -- she's perfect in every way, brave and upstanding, kindly and courteous, idealistic and pragmatic. You will either love her completely or find her unbelievably annoying. I have to admit it was the former for me.<br /><br />There are some endearing flaws in this novel. The mystical stuff is often unintentionally funny. (\\"Maisie closed her eyes, for the great mystics of the east had told her that one could often visualize the unseen by simply focusing from within and closing ones eyes.\\") As someone else mentioned, a lot of these characters are English stereotypes that go back generations, if not centuries. (Billy Beale, the rugged and loyal Cockney, is so by the book Sam Weller and Sam Gamgee both ought to sue his arse!)<br /><br />I do hope that future books will humanize Maisie somewhat, because she really comes across as too good to be true in the first two books. I think most readers like their detectives to be a little more cynical, more bitter, with resentments of their own. Like Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe. Or like Easy Rawlins! These male detectives take a savage pleasure in revealing the filth and corruption of their so-called \\"betters\\" in society, but Maisie Dobbs seems determined to find only what's good and decent in everyone. When her clients stumble she never sneers, she just suggests healthful ways of starting over. It's such a novel approach to the dirty business of sleuthing that it takes your breath away, even though at times you long for some good old fashioned sleaze, or at least some vindictive nastiness.<br /><br />All in all, however, I have to say, bravo for Maisie Dobbs!you long for some good old fashioned sleaze, or at least some vindictive nastiness.  <br /> <br />All in all, however, I have to say, bravo for Maisie Dobbs!	2005-07-04

At that time, I found the haunting atmosphere of Elizabethan sensuality to be extremely arousing and stimulating. Moorcock serves up a rich pageant of decadence, luxury and pleasure, with every variety of sex either shown explicitly or hinted at.<br /><br />The problem is that Moorcock is the kind of guy who gets all the little things right -- but can't create a big picture story-line to save his life! Tiny episodes are scorchingly erotic, like Queen Gloriana's offhand caressing of Lady Mary, or Captain Quire's hypnotic conquest of pouty-lipped boy Phil Starling.<br /><br />But the major plot of the book -- Quire ruins Gloriana, then saves her, then seduces her -- just doesn't ring true. Without making any judgments, it's fair to say that Quire is much more convincing as a gay anti-hero than a heterosexual stud for hire. The scenes where he seduces Phil Starling are a lot tighter, realistic, and more convincing than the scenes where he supposedly beds Gloriana. Moreover, Moorcock never succeeds in establishing Quire as a credible tough guy -- all the rowdies in the wrong part of town are supposedly in awe of this guy, but then he shows up to the big infernal jamboree with a teenage boy as his heavy date! You would think some benighted soul would wonder aloud just how masculine Quire really is. Moorcock carefully shields his hero from such impertinence. And believability goes right out the window!<br /><br />Speaking of believability . . . Gloriana is supposed to be a great queen, an able statesman, and a woman of high principles, but she comes across much more Marilyn Monroe, all jiggles and weepy quivering. Moorcock really has no insight at all into her character. Seems like she'd fall for a stern father figure like Montfallcon much sooner than a closet queen like Quire. All her love scenes are sexy . . . except for the ones with Quire!<br /><br />The maddening thing is that after you've read this book you keep thinking about all the other, better characters. There were about a dozen people in this book I actually liked, but where did they go? Countess Una of Scaith, Lady Mary Perrott, Tinkler the snaggle-toothed ruffian, Wheldrake the poet, Lady Lyst, . . .<br /><br />There were enough characters here for a half dozen good novels, but instead they all got stuck in one bad one!d this book you keep thinking about all the other, better characters.

One reason is that there are no sci-fi trappings, no silliness about time travel or aliens, nothing but a real study of American history and the impact of wealth and greed on the ideal of democracy. While short and exceedingly easy to read, the book feels like an epic narrative, since it sweeps from the very rich to the very poor, from the battlefields of the Civil War to the modern sailing playgrounds of the very rich. It feels much longer and richer than it is in terms of page count alone.<br /><br />For the first and last time, Vonnegut takes the time to outline a realistic setting,Rosewater County Indiana, and observes the effects of poverty there with all the power (but none of the sentimentality) of John Steinbeck at his best. At the same time he cuts back to New York, writing about the rich Rosewater clan and the wealthy families of Pisquontuit with all the power (but none of the sentimentality) of Edith Wharton. Last of all, he uses a brilliant series of flashbacks to describe America's tragic fall from the courage and carnage of the Civil War to the squalor and self-indulgence of America today. The Civil War sections alone are unique in Vonnegut's work; he captures the horror of the casualty rates without in any way denying or shying away from the ideals of the Union Army. He writes about the civil war with all of the power (but none of the sentimentality) of Southern apologists like Charles Frazier.<br /><br />Eliot Rosewater is an ideal American hero,and a fascinating foil to Billy Pilgrim in SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE. Both are All-American guys. But where Billy is an average Joe, Eliot is a scion of wealth and privilege. Where Billy is a ninety eight pound weakling, Eliot is a sailing and tennis champ. Billy is a one-dimensional anti-war propaganda device, (too \\"pure\\" to acquire even the most basic military discipline) while Eliot is a much-decorated officer who fights well and suffers as only a brave man can.<br /><br />The greater power of Eliot Rosewater means that the stakes are much higher. Unlike Billy Pilgrim, Eliot is not a passive weakling but a crusader who sacrifices wealth and privilege to help the poor. His warmth, gentleness and paternal concern for the less fortunate are rendered with tenderness and humor. Vonnegut creates a convincing modern day saint and gives him a real experience among fully realized victims of modern America.<br /><br />As always in Vonnegut, the few flaws in the book all involve women. Eliot's wife Sylvia is flayed raw again and again as a spoiled socialite who simply can't muster up the gumption to stand by Eliot's side. Vonnegut apologizes for her -- but with a sneer. He never seems to have realized that not all women are as fragile and treacherous as his own mother, who, as he never gets tired of telling us, abandoned him by committing suicide at an early age. By the same token, Fred Rosewater of Rhode Island, Eliot's distant cousin, is rendered as gentle and long-suffering, while his wife Caroline is a one-dimensional shrew. Vonnegut can't get away from an instinctive hostility to women as women, as if the mere biological condition of womanhood were some sort of moral weakness.<br /><br />His social criticism, as bracing as it is, often suffers as a result. For example, in the Rhode Island section, he feels like lashing out at the rich, so he writes (quite memorably) \\"four fat, stupid, silly widows in furs were laughing over a bathroom joke printed on a cocktail napkin.\\" Hell of a sentence! Sounds like Joseph Cotten in SHADOW OF A DOUBT. But what does it really mean?<br /><br />What's odd here is that Vonnegut is attacking the rich, only it seems he only means women. And what he hates about women is that they know about sex? That they enjoy sex? That sex exists? That somehow wanting sex killed off the men folk? As Thackeray's Becky Sharp puts it, he leaves women under the weight of an accusation that is, after all, unspoken.<br /><br />Still, this is the one Vonnegut book that really has the feel of a fully accomplished novel, a genuine American classic. It has moral depth and epic scope that he never achieved again.fter all, unspoken.      <br /> <br />Still, this is the one Vonnegut book that really has the feel of a fully accomplished novel, a genuine American classic.

There are several problems.<br /><br />By this time, the hordes are all giving up horseback and swords for rifles and cannon. Thus the excitement of the combat is limited. And the hordes themselves are getting more and more colorless -- this book has none of the mystic rituals, the intrigue, or the glamor of the first couple, when the Qar Qarth and his Shield Bearer had a complex relationship, and the hordes had rituals and a rich, unique culture of their own.<br /><br />The new leader of the Bantags, Ha'ark, just is not a powerful enough character. He doesn't have the classic warrior dignity of Muzta in the first book. And he doesn't have the sinister backstabbing style of Tamuka in book four. He's like a geeky nerd who thinks he can do anything just because he knows about machine guns and cannons. Frankly, I never believed Ha'ark would have been ruthless enough to take over the Bantag horde.<br /><br />Also, we keep stirring in more and more human races, Chinese Zulus and so forth. Forstchen has no time to really make us care about these people the way he did about the Rus in the first book.<br /><br />The only time the book comes alive is during the great escape and locomotive chase. This is powerful and exciting action writing. The running fight is powerful and told in gripping detail. I just wish Hans Schuder did not chew tobacco, I find that really annoying to read about as a positive habit. I also wish that just for once Forstchen could write female characters who do more than make babies and stare at the men folk adoringly as they step into combat.<br /><br />Overall, not as good as the first four books, but still okay.	2005-06-16

The media hype casts her as a fearless iconoclast, a hard-boiled Mencken style truth-teller who rips down the lies and exposes the naked ugliness of celebrity. But that's only partially true.<br /><br />When you read Orth's pieces on Michael Jackson, it becomes very clear that she is not so much attacking Jackson as she is defending white America. Yes, the man is a hardened pedophile, a dangerous criminal who should be locked up for the rest of his life. But it's as plain as the nose on this pathetic creature's face that four hundred years of racial hatred has something to do with his slow descent from human being to faceless monster.<br /><br />A handsome black boy tears his face off to look white, and all Miss Orth has to say is that \\"this is a story of how power can corrode and corrupt.\\"<br /><br />Excuse me, honey? For four hundred years white people have had the power to decide who writes the stories, who sings the songs, who is beautiful and who is ugly. It was powerlessness, not power, that drove poor Michael Jackson to tear his face off in order to look more like you. No one in white America was shocked when this poor wretch spent his entire childhood singing and dancing for our amusement. But when it turns out the experience turned him into a pathetic half-mad wretch, suddenly we've got to \\"save\\" our children from him. When he was a child, no one was trying to save him -- and don't think he doesn't know it!<br /><br />Far from being a penetrating analyst, Maureen Orth is a genius at simply stating the obvious and ignoring the undercurrents. For example, she tells us over and over that Michael \\"got away with it\\" for years because he was making millions for certain powerful industry people. Fine. But isn't there a bit more to it than that? Michael conned white America into thinking he was a child, and not a man -- and don't you think race had something to do with that? His whole alibi has always been, \\"you think I'm a man, but I'm really just a child, and that's all I'll ever be.\\"<br /><br />Now where would a black man get the idea that he's not really a man? Who thought that one up? Could it be, I don't know, SATAN?<br /><br />Michael Jackson got away with it because he told racist white America exactly what it most wanted to hear -- \\"I'm not a man, I'm only a child, and I promise I'll never grow up.\\" And the funny thing is, he kept his part of the bargain, which is probably why he honestly doesn't get why everyone's after him now.<br /><br />If Maureen Orth were really the clear-sighted visionary she pretends to be, she would have explored some of these issues. She would have compared Michael Jackson to Emmett Till, the black boy who was lynched in Mississippi for whistling at a white woman back in 1955. Note that poor Emmett Till was everything Michael Jackson could never be. He was sexually normal, and white America murdered him for showing desire towards a white woman.<br /><br />Now here comes Michael Jackson. He's no Emmett Till. He's the ideal black man for white America. The thought of sex with any woman, black or white, literally makes him ill. Like the ultraviolent Alex in Anthony Burgess' brilliant dystopia A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Michael Jackson is a superb example of social conditioning. He's the black man white America created to very exacting specifications -- and now that we see just how ghastly our handiwork is we want to bury him and forget the truth. And fearless, truth-telling Maureen Orth is leading the pack, shovel in hand.<br /><br />Some journalist! Some truth teller!do with that?

The very fact that a ten year old could read it with no difficulty at all certainly highlights the best of Vonnegut -- his completely natural, clean, flowing colloquial style. Without question, this man is a great American writer in the tradition of Mark Twain.<br /><br />Just as Vonnegut is the modern Mark Twain, so Billy Pilgrim is like Huck Finn, only floating through time instead of floating down the Mississippi. The difficulty with this novel, however, is that unlike Huck Finn the protagonist never grows up, never takes responsibility for his actions, and never really learns anything of lasting value.<br /><br />Most reviewers seem to think that the message of SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE is that \\"war is wrong.\\" This would parallel Twain's message in Huck Finn that slavery is wrong. Problem is, while Huck takes action and strikes out at slavery directly, by freeing Jim, Billy Pilgrim remains merely a passive spectator throughout his life. Vonnegut tries to excuse this with a lot of sci-gimmickry, about being \\"unstuck in time\\" but in the end what really comes across is not the evil of war but one man's personal surrender.<br /><br />There are other problems, more specific to Vonnegut's writing. The whole outer space adventure is fascinating at first, with Billy being a pampered prize exhibit in an intergalactic zoo, with a beautiful porn star as his mate. Thirty years ago I spent hours and hours fantasizing about this -- it's just what a ten year old would think of as the ideal sexual situation.<br /><br />But now that I'm middle aged, I wonder about certain things. Vonnegut stresses over and over again that the tiny Tralfamadorian aliens think Billy is a \\"perfect male specimen.\\" They don't know enough about the male physique to see he's a runty middle aged man. Fair enough. But then, why do they find a stunning porn star for him to mate with? Evidently they know a lot more about women's bodies than men? Why didn't they just pick up a male porn star so they could have a matched set?<br /><br />Then there's the obvious contempt Vonnegut has for women. In the Tralfamadorian sections, the aliens quiz Billy endlessly about life on earth, war, suffering, justice, free will, and so on. But nobody seems to think Montana Wildhack has anything to contribute to the discussion. And evidently there are no female aliens to ask her about the female perspective. The very fact that Vonnegut does this without thinking shows how narrow minded he really is.<br /><br />In the war sections, one notices that beneath the hippy-pleasing pacifist rhetoric there is a lot of callousness, and some strange examples of the double standard. It goes without saying, as many critics have noted, that Vonnegut refuses to discuss the bombing of Dresden in the context of Auschwitz. \\"So it goes\\" replaces more basic insights like, \\"what goes around, comes around,\\" \\"you reap what you sew\\" and \\"you raise hell, you get hell.\\"<br /><br />But there are more subtle manifestations of this. For example, Roland Weary, the vicious American soldier who picks on Billy, is particularized with great skill. His behavior is not just shrugged off with a \\"so it goes.\\" Vonnegut describes it with passion. But what Vonnegut does not do is acknowledge the fact that there are SS and Gestapo agents all over Germany who make Roland Weary look like an amateur. The only Germans we ever see are noble, long-suffering and thoroughly civilized. Even as he condemns America for fighting an unjust war in Vietnam, Vonnegut implies that the German people are in no way to blame for fighting a far more unjust war against an entire continent of people. On the one hand, he insists that free will is an illusion, and no one is responsible for anything, and on the other he condemns American brutality as if we all are personally responsible for everything our government does.<br /><br />The fact is, as rich and rewarding as SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE isas a reading experience, it's not a book you can reread after thirty years and still respect as a classic. Vonnegut has the style and grace of Mark Twain, but not the clear moral vision.as SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE is as a reading experience, it's not a book you can reread after thirty years and still respect as a classic.

Author Ken Sobol has a crisp style and a considerable talent for research, but he bends over backwards to approach Ruth in a confrontational, accusing manner.<br /><br />Sometimes the debunking style is effective -- Sobol wastes no sentimentality on the Babe's early years at St. Mary's Reform School in Baltimore, (\\"a tough, medium security prison\\")or on the \\"Brothers\\" who relied on brutality and violence rather than logic and reason to deal with their wayward students. (Does the Catholic Church ever change?)But what's missing is any sense of the Babe's extraordinary resilience and good humor. Sobol points out all of the Babe's coarseness, rudeness and profanity, while giving short shrift to his generosity, humor and warmth.<br /><br />The chronicle of Babe's playing years is likewise marred by a subtle, persistent effort to represent the man as nothing more than a crude slob. Ironically, Sobol seeks to discredit the Babe mostly by sentimentalizing his teammates, many of whom were still living and cooperating with the author when the book was being written. Far too much of the book is meaningless back-patting of these elderly interview subjects (\\"today Harry Hooper is still the same wonderful, distinguished, venerable, dignified and decent fellow that he was in 1922 -- and his wife and children and their children all agree.\\") As a result Sobol's picture of the Major Leagues in the Twenties is like 100 Prince Charmings and one Gorilla. I hardly think that was actually the case, and I also suspect a lot of the Babe's teammates enjoyed his company a lot more than Sobol lets on.<br /><br />In closing, I would definitely recommend this book for the serious student of baseball, since the historical writing is crisp and Sobol puts together a comprehensive picture of baseball in the Twenties. But his portrait of the Babe's is venemous and distorted, much like Albert Goldman's picture of Elvis Presley (in many ways the only other icon who approaches Babe in significance.)icture of Elvis Presley (in many ways the only other icon who approaches Babe in significance.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-19

I grew up in a small town in upstate New York, surrounded by decent, caring human beings who were proud to call themselves Irish Americans. I believe that even the most bigoted people can change over the course of generations.<br /><br />Having said that, I am truly sickened by the cowardly way Pete Hamill keeps tap-dancing through history, sidestepping the sins of the Irish. The defining event of the Irish experience in America was the Draft Riots of 1863. In an unprecedented orgy of rape, violence, and murder, the Irish let it be known that they were not downtrodden Catholics in a Protestant country, but white men in a white man's country. The Irish made a truly Faustian bargain as a people, turning the rage of centuries on a people even more helpless and disenfranchised than themselves.<br /><br />The Draft Riots were a spectacular success. The blacks were driven out, or driven underground. The Irish gained an absolute monopoly on all city government jobs and patronage, the police force, the fire department, etc. for at least the next hundred years. (Watch the interviews of 9/11 Firefighters and Cops and you'll see that the NYPD and FDNY are still Irish clubs.)The Irish in New York City gained prosperity and power through corruption and murder.<br /><br />This is an ugly story. Perhaps no uglier than the story of the extermination of the Indians by the first colonists, but still an ugly story. And how does Pete Hamill handle this ugly story? Does he write a self-lacerating tragedy like THE SOUND AND THE FURY? Does he write a modern morality play like THE GODFATHER?<br /><br />No, he retreats into childish fantasy. He invents a \\"good\\" Irishman who adores blacks, makes friends with voodoo men, and waves a magic sword at the brave Irish bully boys who are busy hanging black men from lamposts. The suffering of the blacks themselves is barely hinted at; instead we get a soulful, thoughtful Boss Tweed musing that \\"we\\" may never recover from this.<br /><br />Pete Hamill, if you have to lie about your own heritage in order to respect diversity, if you have to make Boss Tweed into Santa Claus in order to be proud to be an American, then I suggest you sail back to Ireland without delay.<br /><br />Don't forget your magic sword.that \\"we\\" may never recover from this.  <br /> <br />Pete Hamill, if you have to lie about your own heritage in order to respect diversity, if you have to make Boss Tweed into Santa Claus in order to be proud to be an American, then I suggest you sail back to Ireland without delay.  <br /> <br />Don't forget your magic sword.  <br /> <br />	2005-04-12

This time the plot is quite bizarre -- a spoiled Manhattan princess jets to Ireland and chains herself to the American embassy to illustrate her horror at man's inhumanity to man. Specifically she seems to be all choked up about some Irish boy who washed out of the IRA or something. Funny how the princess had to fly all the way to Ireland to find doomed, broken boys to feel sorry for. I hear the prisons in America are full of boys, most of them black or brown. But I suppose a \\"liberal\\" Irish Catholic like Mary Gordon doesn't see black boys in prison as having the same allure as Bobby Sands or whatever other martyr of the week they've got over there.<br /><br />This book is not only melodramatic and overwrought, (yes, Mary, I said \\"overwrought\\") it is screamingly funny in all the wrong places. For example, Pearl's mother Maria is supposed to have been a hippy yippie student radical back in the Sixties. And there is a long (some would say endless) passage at the beginning describing the feverish uncertainty and the horror, the horror, of living through those days as an angry young college girl. (Was it really that much worse than combat in Vietnam, Mary?)And of course we all know hippies love rock music, so Mary keeps quoting lyrics from -- from -- wait for it -- wait for it -- \\"Feeling Groovy (The 59th Street Bridge Song)\\" by Simon and Garfunkel.<br /><br />Now call me crazy, but I don't think the really mean, hardcore, bomb throwing SDS type radicals on campus had much time for Simon and Garfunkel. I think Mary Gordon is laughably out of touch, and that it renders the entire hippy section unbelievable and unreadable. Some more believable hippy tunes for the gang:<br /><br />\\"Wooden Ships\\" by Crosby Stills, Nash and Young<br />\\"Going Home\\" by Alvin Lee and Ten Years After<br />\\"Going Up The Country\\" by Canned Heat<br />\\"For What It's Worth\\" by the Buffalo Springfield<br />\\"Feel Like I'm Fixin To Die Rag\\" by Country Joe and The Fish.<br /><br />Note well that I was born in 1963, and I have a better idea of good Sixties rock and roll than Mary Gordon. What was this woman really doing all through the Sixties? Sitting in a dark room, saying the rosary with the shades drawn? She sure writes like it!<br /><br />This is more than just a matter of baby-boomer nostalgia. As a sweaty, desperate social climber from Queens, Mary puts an awful lot of emphasis on the value of \\"good taste.\\" She claims that one way Pearl can tell that Bobby Sands is not a real martyr is that he writes lousy poetry. (Try that one for logic!) But it therefore follows, using this same logic, that hippies who listen to \\"Feeling Groovy\\" instead of \\"Wooden Ships\\" are fake hippies, not the real thing. It's a matter of taste, and the irony is that poor, mean, stuck up snob Mary Gordon really has no taste when it comes to rock and roll music. No taste at all.<br /><br />By the way -- in 1863 the Irish in New York City went wild, lynching raping and mutilating black people all over the city. If Mary Gordon is really interested in the \\"will to harm\\" maybe she could write about that.<br /><br />Or maybe not.orth\\" by the Buffalo Springfield  \\"Feel Like I'm Fixin To Die Rag\\" by Country Joe and The Fish.

The difference is in the class -- the way shy, gentle Anne is always sympathetic, a heroine who is too sensitive and romantic for the brutal passions and greed of the Hollywood world.<br /><br />Anne is drawn to Webb, a man who seems to be all wrong for her. Webb is hard and brutal and successful, so masculine he threatens to dominate Anne like the other men in her life. Frightened, she runs off with a long succession of older, seemingly kinder men, yet they turn out to be more manipulative than truly caring. As a neglected trophy wife, Anne develops a dangerous dependency on pills like Valium -- Rosemary Rogers shows clearly how a jet-set world that makes drug abuse seem chic and sophisticated can easily harm the innocent. Drifting this way and that, pursued by men and losing herself in sensation, Anne nearly loses it all -- before Webb comes to the rescue.<br /><br />THE CROWD PLEASERS is scary sometimes, touching and poignant and even melancholy -- but always oh so powerful and sexy!	2005-02-15

Then one day I rented the movie LAURA from 1944 and totally understood. Gore Vidal is exactly like Waldo Leidecker, the fussy old queen who dabbles in writing and always has the right put-down for every occasion -- yet is incapable of self-knowledge, humility, or anything else.<br /><br />How can one possibly describe all the things that are wrong with this \\"historical\\" novel? Vidal does nothing but take the very cheapest of cheap shots at everyone he can possibly think of. George Washington has \\"the breasts, hips, and buttocks of a woman.\\" Huh?!?! It's not hard to guess what Vidal wants to believe -- they're all just like me, I'm not a freak, I'm not -- but somehow it's hard to believe an active man like Washington could have survived an eventful life filled with outdoor activities if he had been some sort of bizarre hemaphrodite.<br /><br />Vidal needs to believe that somehow everyone in the world is dirtier than he is. He longs to find all the dirt on everyone, yet at the same time he's too prissy to get down to cases on real problems and issues. If you want to trash Jefferson, okay -- show what life was like for a slave on his plantation. But Gore Vidal, the southern belle, can't handle the unpleasantness. By the same token, if you want to trash Washington, show Indian women and children being murdered in cold blood. But Vidal is too much of a drawing room novelist to handle a frontier scene.<br /><br />To sum up then, Vidal would like to style himself as the ultimate cynic, and yet in some ways he is painfully naive. Unable to deal with positive emotions, yet equally unable to come to terms with real horror and real evil, he resorts to titillating whispers and bitchier-than-thou silliness.<br /><br />The whole thing is a profound waste of time.	2005-02-14

Half sister Delight is the most wickedly adventurous porn star in the business. Sara is in the middle, wondering -- will any man ever find me desirable?<br /><br />Enter Marco DeCavlieri, the most intense, passionate, possessive, and GORGEOUS hunk in all of Italy. Worth hundreds of millions, powerful and ruthless, Marco is still brutally protective of his family honor. When he hears that his silly younger brother Carlo has taken up with gold-digger Delight, he decides to take matters into his own hands!<br /><br />What happens next is just too sexy to be described. It's sort of like mistaken identity, with a bit of kidnaping, only Sara soon finds she doesn't want to escape! Her beauty and goodness inflame the dark duke, so that soon he finds himself giving in to her instead of the other way around. And then -- oh, but I can't go on. Read it for yourself!<br /><br />Magnificent, epic length, and sexy, this tale of passion between a proper English society girl and an uninhibited Italian Duke is truly the best of both worlds. It has the elegance, luxury and mystery of a great historical -- Marco is really more of a 16th century Corsair than a modern jet setter, even if he does have his own helicopter, sports car and mansion. On the other hand, golden-haired Sara is really more of an innocent, chaste, Jane Austen heroine, even if she is the daugher of a famous -- and sexually adventurous -- movie star.<br /><br />Even the minor characters are fascinating, like Carlo, the Brooklyn born stepbrother Marco protects, and Delight, the party girl with a heart of gold, and even Serafina, the stern old housekeeper who functions as a mother figure for Sara. Great story, great romance, great settings and characters!	2005-02-11

Of course, critics hated it -- especially female critics. And you know why? Because there's nothing ugly ducklings hate worse than the idea that even swans suffer. For nasty old yentas like Daphne Merkin, it's bad enough that Claire Bloom is the most perfect, lovely English rose who ever lived. They hate her for that no matter what she happens to be like as a human being. But the fact that she can feel, and think, and love, and write -- intolerable!<br /><br />This book reveals all the horror of Philip Roth's failures as a writer and a human being. The fact that his self-loathing is so often disguised as megalomania and artistic temperament is no excuse for the unbelievable suffering he caused to those around him. Reading this book makes it much easier to understand the fundamental ugliness of his later works. Plainly, Roth needs to believe that the whole world hates him as much as he hates himself. Reading the story, one senses that if anything Claire Bloom has been too kind, making excuses for a man who obviously has no pride and no shame, no sense of resonsibility and not a shred of common decency. Not even Trick E. Dixon or Big John Baal or Gil Gamesh himself could have behaved this atrociously!<br /><br />At the same time, Claire Bloom herself emerges from these pages as a very fragile soul who never really recovered from a painful childhood. It's impossible not to wish she had been a little stronger -- or that the men in her life had been more worthy of her. Gore Vidal, Yul Brynner, Richard Burton, all legendary figures in one way or another, yet none of them had the special decency or the courage to recognize the heavenly, radiant, ethereal beauty that was Claire Bloom.<br /><br />There will never be another like her.	2005-02-01

But they don't trust each other. Then at the end they do trust each other.<br /><br />What made this book dull and slow was that there was too little of the hot sex you can always find in Sandra Marton's Harlequin Presents titles. Instead there was a lot of nastiness -- obscene photos, obscene messages, every other scene the heroine is terrified and in tears. And she and the hero are always slapping and swearing and calling each other by their last names, to show they're edgy or something. It makes them really unattractive.<br /><br />This is the kind of book where the minor characters are more interesting than the hero and heroine. I wanted to know more about Eva, the perfume magnate with the steamy, sexy past. And I wanted to see more of Vince and Joe, the two doomed ex-cons who kidnap Miranda at the end. They had a real chemistry together, sort of like George and Lennie in OF MICE AND MEN.<br /><br />\\"We've got to turn this girl over to the big boss, Joe, but someday we'll have a girl of our own.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tell me again about the hooters, Vince.\\"<br /><br />If you're looking for a truly sizzling and sensual romance, try THE CORSICAN GAMBIT by Sandra Marton.

I read this book when I was fifteen, and I was appalled at the heavy-handed way Lurie heaps scorn on virtually ALL the characters. Hippies, academics, and housewives, all seem to rate as easy joke material for her, but she never explains why. I also felt that she comes across as callous and self-righteous in the way she gloats over all the misery her make believe people suffer. If you read a classic like DEAD SOULS by Gogol you see some mean, petty people -- but Gogol doesn't laugh at them for suffering, only for being foolish. Lurie doesn't get how satire works.<br /><br />Getting to the specifics -- a reviewer above made an interesting point. Given that Erica Tate is described (over and over) as a stunning beauty, it is awfully odd that when Brian leaves her the only man she can find to hang out with is uber-dweeb Zed. This guy makes Woody Allen look like Bruce Willis! Similarly, Professor Brian Tate is such a pompous little twerp that it's difficult to imagine even the most depraved and lustful hippie chick throwing herself at him.<br /><br />Lurie knows less than nothing about the Sixties youth culture she intends to \\"satirize.\\" At one point Brian catches his daughter listening to a \\"Stones record\\" and the chorus of the song supposedly goes \\"awah gotcha BOOM BOOM!\\"<br /><br />Listen to every Stones album from \\"England's Newest Hit Makers\\" to \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\\" and you will never find this song. Why couldn't the lady have done some homework? Either that or taken five seconds to make up a pretend rock group, perhaps with an oh-so-clever \\"satirical\\" name like the Ugly Brutes or something?<br /><br />Another problem, given that Wendy is supposed to be a nubile hippie chick, and Brian a staid professor, the sex scenes should have been a lot steamier than they were. All things considered, Lurie totally underestimated the hippy generation, its staying power, determination, and so forth. The Stones are still rolling, thirty years later, but no one is reading this book.<br /><br />Awah gotcha BOOM BOOM!ng this book.  <br /> <br />Awah gotcha BOOM BOOM!  <br />	2004-12-07

I read it about twenty years ago and even then recognized what a fundamentally phony book it was. A book on images of America in rock and roll, huh? Well, let's see, who's missing here?<br /><br />CHUCK BERRY -- not a word.<br /><br />BRIAN WILSON -- nothing.<br /><br />LIEBER AND STOLLER -- nothing.<br /><br />BOB DYLAN -- nope.<br /><br />EDDIE COCHRAN -- zero.<br /><br />Griel Marcus is the kind of guy who thinks he can make anything sound classy by comparing it to Huckleberry Finn. And not the text written by Mark Twain, either. No, that might mean having to quote and cite evidence. Marcus loves to talk about the \\"myth\\" of Huckleberry Finn, like the culture created it. No,<br /><br />as Huck tells us on page one, \\"that book was written by Mr. Mark Twain.\\" And you know what, Griel bubbe? You -- ain't -- him!<br /><br />Most of the music Marcus actually writes about in this book is fifth rate crap nobody ever heard of. He doesn't review big hits because then the reader could actually critique his views and compare his raving with what the songs actually say. Harmonica Frank was a nobody, a non-talented non-entity, but Marcus gives the guy a full chapter so that Marcus can say whatever he wants without any contradictions. It's the dumbest form of elitism and one-upmanship masquerading as populism.<br /><br />Another problem is Marcus' sentimentality about violence. Note well that this is a coward who wouldn't have made it through Army basic, let alone combat in Vietnam, yet he writes page after page after page about how joyous and invigorating it is to listen to songs about Stagger Lee shooting Billy, and rednecks slashing each other with razors, and God knows what else. Forget drugs and groupies, this is true rock and roll decadence.<br /><br />The best part of the book, as most critics admit, is the section on Elvis Presley, pretentiously named \\"The Presliad.\\" Elvis was no Achilles, and Griel Marcus is no Homer. Elvis was a coward, a liar, a weakling, who despised his audience and betrayed his music every chance he got. Marcus never comes close to owning up to Elvis' failures as a man and an artist. Elivs sells his soul to the devil, or to Nixon, and somehow it just makes Elvis more of a victim. Why can't Marcus admit that Elvis was trash? The music was good, sure. But the man was trash. Marcus isn't adult enough to handle that kind of contradiction so he falls back on endless babble about Ahab and Huck and the American \\"myths\\" that are not written down, not subject to rational discussion, and in fact seem to exist only in Marcus' head.<br /><br />And they call this rock criticism?e Presliad.\\" Elvis was no Achilles, and Griel Marcus is no Homer.

I recommend it without hesitation! Grant Morgan is more like a modern homicide cop than a lord or a duke or a rake or whatever they call them. When Grant finds the beautiful but spoiled and cruel Vivien unconscious down by the docks he takes her home, determined to save her life but also to make her pay for lying about him and spreading rumors in society that he once made an ungentlemanly approach to her virtue!<br /><br />The set up is wonderful, and the follow through amazing. Grant soon finds that Vivien does not remember who she is or what she was doing by the docks -- was someone trying to kill her? Finding her killer and keeping her safe soon force Grant to feel more and more protective of his beautiful and helpless guest.<br /><br />One major complaint (stop here if you don't want to know the full story.) Early on, we here an awful lot about how bold and sexy and uninhibited Vivien is -- she was really more of a call girl than a society beauty. We keep hoping for a real clash of wills between the sexy, outrageos courtesan and the hard, upright lawman. But at the last moment Lisa Kleypas (who is a wonderful writer and an incredible talent) seems to lose her nerve and pull a classic \\"bait and switch.\\" It seems the lovely victim in Grant's bed is not REALLY the most notorious courtesan in London, but her innocent twin sister fresh from the country.<br /><br />Oh please! The distressing thing is that letting VIVIEN be the heroine was so obviously the right choice -- but I suspect Lisa Kleypas thought the romance readership wouldn't let her get away with it. Romance heroines \\"must\\" be virgins -- sigh.<br /><br />Dear Lisa, next time break the rules! You can do it if anyone can. We're all with you, because you're the best there is!	2004-11-26

What makes it so rewarding is that the history is real on both sides of the story. Yes, as all the other commentators have noted, Andrew Keane and his Maine men are in every way equal in courage and idealism to Colonel Chamberlain and his team from THE KILLER ANGELS. It really is heart-wrenching and inspiring to see the events in this action-packed story give literal meaning to phrases like &quot;we'll fill the vacant ranks with a million freemen more.&quot; The book shows that the &quot;battle cry of freedom&quot; was not merely an idealistic wish but a realistic and workable policy.<br />But what no one has noticed is that the book is at least as enlightening on the subject of RUSSIAN history and society. The Tugar hordes are an alien race, but Forstchen's stroke of genius was to make them human by giving them the culture, outlook and capabilities of Genghis Khan's Mongol hordes. Note that this author bucks fifty years of Science Fiction convention here. These space aliens are not little green men with huge, bulging craniums and ray guns. Rather they are eight foot giants who despise all learning, technology, and even basic handicrafts. They are trapped in a nomadic, essentially sterile way of life that goes nowhere, and little by little in each book you sense their increasing pessimism and despair. Sustained brilliance by Forstchen makes these &quot;hordes&quot; into characters as compelling as any in the works of Larry McMurtry or James Fenimore Cooper. The hordes are doomed to extinction just like the noble red men of the American west.<br />Returning to the Mongol hordes analogy, however, what makes RALLY CRY such an eye-opening book is Forstchen's analysis of medieval Russia. Here THE KILLER ANGELS meets ALEKSANDER NEVSKY. Forstchen shows how the unhealthy alliance between boyars and the church, and the suffocation of the peasants, is a long-lasting after effect of the terrifying threat of Mongol invasion. Never before did I see quite so clearly how and why Russia evolved into a backwards, impoverished autocracy. The unspeakable horror of the Tugar feasts allows the nobility and the church to rule unquestioned and with no accountability to their own people. Though this is science fiction, it is also superb social commentary and insightful history.<br />This book is a classic -- even if you hate science fiction, you will love this!asion.

As a rather shy girl who inherits a great deal of money at a young age, Lydia is surrounded by young men anxious to please. But instead of settling on just one, Lydia soon finds that she can enjoy two or three young men buzzing around her as long as she likes. She plays them against each other and allows each one to think that only he has won her heart. But all the while, her own lifestyle is growing ever more reckless and self destructive.<br />The sex scenes in this book are very steamy. Deep down Lydia is the type of girl who really just can't get enough. But she's also very good at pretending to be cold and haughty when dealing with her gentleman friends. When dealing with the well to do lads who offer marriage, she can be quite stiff, yet the secret flings she has with local working lads are very sexy and raw.<br />The narrator of this book is honest and true. He is the only young man in the village who sees Lydia for what she is. The sad thing is, he can't help loving her. But finally he walks away. When that happens, Lydia becomes truly heartbroken. There are more parties, and more wild affairs, and of course there is more drinking. Lydia smokes and drinks and is the very picture of the glamorous young, always having fun and being quite scandalous.<br />Yet all the time, there is a hollowness in her life she can't understand. The last chapters of the book show Lydia really reaching a decision to reach out honestly to the man she loves. Of course you don't see that right away. At first she just feels blue without knowing why. It's so touching the way she has one jazz record that reminds her of that honest young love, and she plays that record only when alone in her room. You see her lying around after a late night, resting in her room and listening to the music, and thinking. Is this all she wants from life? Gradually she drops off to sleep on the bed, and the faces of all the young men she's kissed come back to her. But when she falls asleep she pictures herself with that special young man, not dancing to hot jazz or making out in a car, but the time he taught her how to ice skate on the frozen river.<br />Lydia knows what she has to do. But does she succeed? LOVE FOR LYDIA is a sexy book with some really romantic moments.eep on the bed, and the faces of all the young men she's kissed come back to her.

US	35129100	R1NJTIW4E1ZLTT	0553576232	523365178	Shadows and Lace	Books	5	27	31	N	N	Spicy Medieval Romance With Enchanting Characters	When I first began reading historical romance, I noticed that some authors wrote dark and intense stories, while others created a playful and romantic atmosphere. Teresa Medeiros is the only romance writer I have ever seen who can create a tale that is dark and suspensful while still containing adorable characters and humor that really makes you laugh and laugh. I don't know how she does this, but she does!<br />Another mark of a truly great author is that she creates secondary characters who are even more memorable than the hero and heroine. Blaine, the lightweight, lying knight, would simply be a villain in any other romance, but in this book he is a much more complicated character. You can understand why he resents Gareth and why he lusts after Rowena without just being evil. Even better was Gareth's tomboy sister Marlys. Her signature is attacking her brother in the woods, jumping out from ambush, just like Kato in the PINK PANTHER movies. But in this book the horseplay is the sign of a very deep and complex family relationship. Teresa Medeiros is amazing at creating dark, even cruel characters that you ultimately come to feel great tenderness for. When you read this book you will ache for Marlys and long for her to find her own happy ending.<br />One thing I think is noticeable about this book is that Rowena, the heroine, is the soft, girly kind of heroine we don't see much anymore. She is the blonde who always gets picked on. Even her name is deliberately taken from the girl in IVANHOE who is sort of weepy and whiny and not in control of the action. Feminists may not like it but Teresa Medeiros does an extraordinary job showing how this kind of woman has her own kind of courage and her own emotional needs. Her weak, manipulative father is handled just right, in a forgiving but perceptive way, so you can see why Rowena might not have much self esteem at first. Yet even so, she is really far more courageous emotionally than the &quot;stronger&quot; characters who bully her. Read this book and you will soon realize that Teresa Medeiros is a major literary artist who happens to write romance.ho bully her.

But the story wanders around way too much. First it's about two children at the palace. Okay. A boy and girl who love each other, only she's a princess and he's a slave. Okay. There are some great chapters about the boy being picked on at school. Then suddenly that's over and the girl is a sexy teenager and in love with the villain Vesputo. Then it's all about her mother the queen getting hooked on drugs. Then it's all about the girl, only she's a farmer living in another kingdom? Then there's this good high king who wants to save the world, only now the slave boy is a secret spy leading a jolly band of Ali Baba type thieves? Too many kings, too many kingdoms, too little romance, and the story just wanders off.<br />They should have stayed in the first kingdom, fighting the evil King Vesputo. But Vesputo was also a very lame character. He was supposed to be evil but I kept cracking up at how he acted. Always frowning and shoving people around. He reminded me of \\"Bluto\\" in the old POPEYE cartoons, so bad you just laugh at him. He also reminded of \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky in the movie ANIMAL HOUSE -- the guy John Belushi played. I kept seeing evil King Vesputo as Belushi, wearing a black sweatshirt with the word \\"VILLAIN\\" written on it in big white medieval letters. And I kept seeing him talking to the slave boy like Belushi, saying, \\"your father is dead and your magic sword has been stolen. I suggest you begin drinking heavily!\\"	2004-06-06

Each book in the series is like a cross between EASY RIDER and GONE WITH THE WIND, with all the phoniest elements of each.<br />Pseudo-liberal good ole boy Dave Robicheaux gets all bent out of shape when Eye-talian mobsters and no-account Yankees from the CIA start pushing around local blacks and stealing their humble little cabins for some nefarious Northern scheme. Poor Dave gets all misty just thinking about the saintly Robert E. Lee and his heroes in homespun gray. Bashing the mob and the CIA is the only way he can keep his illusions intact. But when the ghost of General Lee appears in drag, warning Dave to stop lying to himself about the stupidity and corruption of his own ancestors, it looks as though another AA meeting is all that stands between a corrupt, booze-sodden phony and his inevitable moment of truth.<br />This books reads like George Wallace wrote it after dropping acid and locking himself in a room with Joan Baez for two days.	2004-03-07

She overcomes fear, darkness, magic, and betrayal to save an innocent boy. In the process, she wins the respect of the frightening yet strangely inspiring Lady In Green, who is uniquely both a hero and a villain, an evil witch and a beautiful queen. Certainly this is a story of feminist empowerment and female coming of age that values intelligence and character over beauty and charm. It is suspensful, exciting, rewarding to read, and really has no equal anywhere. But I'd like to comment on some connections readers may not have noticed.<br />The Lady In Green is obviously based on witches and druid priestesses of the remote past. But notice how Elizabeth Marie Pope presents her in ways that have modern parallels. Just like a modern drug dealer, the Lady In Green preys on human weakness. She relies on the addictive nature of the water of the well, and uses it to defraud wealthy pilgrims of priceless gold and jewels. She runs an empire under the ground not so different from the underground empire a modern crack dealer might create.<br />Just as drug dealers in the inner city often have corrupt cops on the payroll, so the Lady In Green has clearly bought the cooperation of the loathsome castle steward, Master John. You almost expect Randal the Mad Minstrel to begin humming the \\"Pusherman\\" theme from the movie \\"Superfly.\\" \\"I'm your witch, I'm your queen, I'm the Lady In Green . . . \\"<br />At the same time, the Lady In Green runs her coven of druid folk in a way that is oddly reminiscent of a modern, totalitarian state. This book was written at the height of the Cold War, and it shows. Notice how the Lady In Green has her society divided into a two halves. The workers are given lots of rich food and physical comforts, and drugs are placed in their food to make them happy. Shades of Soma in the BRAVE NEW WORLD! At the same time there is a small elite -- which Kate is soon invited to join -- which is drug free but receives intense and ceaseless indoctrination in the joys of serving the perfect leader. One almost expects Gwenyfara and the others to refer to the Lady as \\"glorious comrade queen\\" or \\"our fearless leader.\\" Indeed, the Lady's message to Kate is -- Big Sister is watching you!<br />A couple of flaws in this book which I must point out, even though I truly agree with all the wonderful things others have said. First of all, does anyone believe that after finding so much courage and strength in herself Kate would ever be content to go back to that pitiful wimp Christopher and help him run his two-bit farm, sloshing out the manure pile and all? I always assumed she would go back and serve as Queen Elizabeth's right hand girl. Second of all, the whole sibling rivalry thing is just a bit overdone, dumb blonde Alicia does everything but sprout devil horns by the end of the book. I know this is red meat stuff for the feminist crowd, but it has to be handled with tact and care. Quibbles aside, though, this is the most wonderful young adult novel I have ever read.to join -- which is drug free but receives intense and ceaseless indoctrination in the joys of serving the perfect leader.

Years later, I picked up EQUATION FOR EVIL hoping it would be equally compelling.<br />What a disappointment! This story of a serial killer is slow and predictable, but what really makes the book a chore to read is the crude, heavy-handed nature of Caputo's moralization on the nature of evil. With no sense of irony and no sense of history, Caputo repeats over and over that evil is a \\"choice\\" and that modern man has lost his moral \\"compass\\" through to much excess, permissiveness, and mass-media sex and violence. These thoughts come from his protagonist, Heartwood, a man trained by Catholic Jesuit priests who is no longer a practicing Catholic but who  retains a deep and unquestioning loyalty to his mentors, the elite Jesuits.<br />The murder of a handful of Asian children on a bus is supposed to be decisive proof that modern man has somehow lost his way. But when medieval Europe was firmly under the control of the Catholic church Jewish children were murdered in much larger numbers over a period of centuries! The crimes of the Catholic church throughout the centuries are far more horrendous than any of the media sex and violence Heartwood deplores in this novel. Moreover, his authoritarian nonsense about religion providing a \\"compass\\" falls apart in the face of the real corruption and evil that has always existed within the church hierarchy.<br />It is worth noting that there is not one single Jewish character in this novel, not one person who could challenge Caputo's  ignorance about the history of his own church. Caputo ignores the Crusades, the Inquisition, the religious violence of the Reformation, and three centuries of the African slave trade -- all horrific crimes against humanity committed with the express written consent of the Catholic church. He actually has the effrontery to suggest that modern crimes prove man cannot survive without \\"guidance\\" like that provided by the vicious, murderous, destructive Catholic church of the medieval world. The only real villains in this novel are scientists, intellectuals, and Jews -- in that order. Caputo reserves special venom for Sigmund Freud, who was both a scientist and a Jew, and whose teachings on sex undermine the repressive policies of the Catholic church. But at least Sigmund Freud never burned any Catholics at the stake.<br />The hypocisy of this book is evident on every page. On a visit to Los Angeles in search of a teen runaway, the smug Heartwood refers to Hollywood as \\"the Vatican of illusions.\\" Does the Vatican stand for truth? The truth that Jews are the killers of Christ? That blacks are inferior? That Protestants burn in hell? That the sun moves around the earth? In what exact way is the Vatican superior to Hollywood?<br />This book is an offense against tolerance and truth.ry to suggest that modern crimes prove man cannot survive without \\"guidance\\" like that provided by the vicious, murderous, destructive Catholic church of the medieval world.

The problem with this book is that Nyreen -- the scheming step mother -- is about 900 times sexier and more ambitious than pouty, sulky, not-too-bright Little Miss Dayne. When Nyreen is alone with poor, dumb, fat Harry, the bumbling father figure in the novel, and slowly sucking him dry in all kinds of sex scenes that are exhausting to read but incredibly exciting, well the book is a classic. On a very animal level! Harry's befuddled lust, and Nyreen's manipulation, are not inspiring, but they are vividly real. The human exploitation fits in very nicely with the slavery setting -- after all, people who own slaves are born manipulators and skilled at reducing others to the animal level.<br />But Dayne and Flint are not really that good a couple. Neither seems to feel that slavery is wrong, or right either. They sort of drift through the setting without being part of it. They don't love each other, and they don't even like each other. They trade insults and then start having sex. Unlike Nyreen, Dayne has no clear cut goals and no real determination to do things her way. She just drifts from one hot love scene to another.<br />If you love hot romance, this book is a classic and well worth reading. But if you demand strong characters and a heroine you can admire, you should probably just give it a miss.	2003-12-07

This is an old fashioned romance, full of elegance and luxury. It is unique in that the hero does not rush the heroine or try to pressure her, and the story shows that he is as much a victim of circumstance as she is. Instead of being kept locked in a dungeon Brenna is always treated with courtesy and care by her new husband,and gradually the formal kisses they exchange in the public eye become more lingering and less public, as sweet, shy Brenna loses her self-consciousness and discovers her womanly desires. But treachery surrounds both husband and wife.<br />Most Highland novels focus on the conflict with the cruel English, but this tale is unique in that it shows how clans often fought among themselves, resorting to treachery, murder, and seduction.

You can't say that the sexual predators go unpunished, and Rosemary Rogers is always very honest about how cruel and evil they are.<br />Frankly, this book is sexy in every way you can think of, not just in ways that involve violence and brutality. Check out the Gibraltar scenes, and you notice how carefully Rosemary Rogers keeps things in balance. Laura gets a massage from a very sweet and attentive Moroccan maid while Helena gets disciplined by her useless English lord husband. But in the end both girls are rescued and find happy endings with very virile American husbands who are rich, good looking and super passionate. So just relax and dig the pleasures of the hot-blooded and super rich.	2003-11-28

Shy and graceful Francesca feels horribly out of place in the decadent jet-set world of her brother's shady finance dealings. But when he takes her to Monaco to charm some clients, she agrees reluctantly, feeling the need to protect her charming but totally irresponsible half brother.<br />Little does Francesca know that her dear dim brother has seriously inconvenienced shark-like financial wiz Max Donelli. Max, a Corsican nobleman, is used to fast cars and fast women, and he handles both with ease. But Francesca is something new. Instead of a one night fling, he takes the gentle blonde to his ancient castle and keeps her as \\"hostage\\" to make sure her brother pays back all the money he embezzled. Francesca loathes Max at first, in spite of the way her senses buzz every time they rub up against each other in his rugged jeep or in the gardens of his medieval fortress. Before long the two of them are wondering whether the sexual passions exploding between them are the result of hatred or love.<br />This is the kind of romance we don't see much anymore, a classic and classy damsel in the very firm hands of an old-fashioned hunk and man of honor. Sandra Marton is truly the best of the old-school Harlequin authors, and her work only grows better with age, like fine wine or autographed baseballs or Fifties doo-wop.	2003-11-26
