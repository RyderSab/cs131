I was looking for a cheap mp3 version of the Bible and was thrilled to find The Message.  While there are extra readings on the disk, they tend to stay out of the way and leave the spotlight to the Message itself.  For the price, the quality is excellent and is a great addition to anyone's iPod or CD collection	2005-09-08

Like all the commentaries in the series, this is a preaching commentary and I find his handing of the creation narrative as a proclamation of sovereignty to be excellent.  I wish I had found this commentary much earlier in my journey.	2005-08-21

It takes a part worship components from several worship gatherings and spaces in England and puts them into book form to inspire, teach, and to be used in your own context.  The book has a lot of theological and creative richness in it and is a book that you will probably return to again and again for ideas and help in your own worship setting.  I have seen parts of it used in traditional parishes and in brand new alternative worship spaces as well as seeker services.  You may not use all of it but you will appreciate the time and effort put into all of it.<br />The CD that comes with it is okay but the inability to cut and paste from it is a minor irritation.	2004-02-13

The result is this roadmap of change that is happening all around us told through story and rich visual metaphors.<br />The book is one of the best I have read this year and is one that as a pastor I have ordered for the rest of the churches leadership to read as a starting place to help them find their bearings in a world of changing values and worldviews.<br />The book is written from the viewpoint of a person who was in church leadership.  It looks at many of the changes from that point of view.  While the book can be read and understood by anyone, the perspective is that of a leader and shows that point of view.  The cool part is that Spencer uses his own pastoral ministry as not a \\"do like me\\" but more of \\"learn from my mistakes and find your own path\\".<br />Some of the book has been covered by other authors (but hey, that are all writing on the same topic so some overlap is going to happen) but there were several sections in the book which generated some serious introspective thought and reflection.  I have read the book three times now and each time brings out more I need to think through.<br />Unlike some books on the church by those inside it, Spencer show humility, grace, and a great sense of humor.<br />The book is not one that you will just read and put down but one of those books that will be re-read years from now.  You may want a couple of copies to give away to friends as well (they probably won't want to give it back)	2003-09-27

I walked away with so many unsettling thoughts that it kept me awake at night.<br />Why is the church now so indifferent to the victims of genocide when it used to rally around it?<br />Why do we only look at our own domestic interests even when it means death to entire people groups?<br />When are we going to demand our elected representatives to have a global worldview in regards to genocide and start to enforce laws against crimes against humanity?<br />The book is amazing and well written.

Weshler-Henry does an excellent job of explaining the legality, issues, opportunities, and dangers of p2p, open source, and intellectual property in a way that makes sense to the average consumer.  It was a great book to read and one that more of us who use the web and care about those issues need to educate ourselves in.  The author writes in a lively style and while the book is a little out of date now (iTunes and the RIAA's new strategy of sue everyone) hadn't happened yet, the basics of what he is getting at still hold true.<br />He does a good job in documenting both the official response and the grassroots reaction (which aren't always the same) to the issues and engages both equally.  This book isn't a classic by any means but is one that is worth reading.	2003-09-22

It either resonates deeply with the reader or you don't get it at all.<br />For a new generation of church leaders, the book articulates much of what we have struggled with as the modern church tries to live in the postmodern era.  <br />No matter how one sees the church and God's people, you will be provoked, disagree, laugh, and will be forced to think about the challenges that the authors lay before you.  <br />I am glad I read and re-read the book.

Not only was Janice McKinnon a leader during some of the hardest days in Saskatchewan's history, she is a great historian and story teller.<br />I was impressed with her non-partisan look at the Blakeney and Devine governments.  She protrayed their intentions and results fairly and balanced.  Her look at her own political career was enjoyable as well as she documented the struggles and tensions within the Romanow government and the challenges that she had to make in her own department.

It is designed for church champions and consultants but is a must read by any denominational executive or a person who works with local churches.<br />It includes some extraordinary diagnostic questions, ideas, and the contrarian statements that Schaller does so well. <br />It is a book that is useful for any pastor as it has enough nuggets and ideas that it may eliminate some of your need for a consultant in the first place.	2001-06-21

First of all, let me say that Chapter 9 (Build Your Own Greenhouse) was worth the price of the book.  As we build a new building, we are using the ideas, innovations, and principles that this book has shown us.<br />The chapters on team and interaction can be used at almost any organization.

It was given to me by a denominational executive to read and I found it lacking in several areas.  The authors seem unaware of current trends that are  effecting rural churches across Canada and the United States.  While this  book may provide some insight, if you are pastoring a rural church, you  know everything that they have written already.	2000-01-04

It is a book that outlines spiritual principles that all of us need to know as we serve the church and God.  This has been one of the  books that I have constantly referred to over the years and will continue  to go back to.	1999-12-11
