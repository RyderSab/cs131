Ever since Jere was a child, he was haunted with a scary murder playing over and over again.  He was no idea what-so-ever of why this dream is haunting him.  Jere was a normal teenage boy.  He liked to play sports.  Soccer was his favorite. One day when he was going to the park with his friend, he sees a man that looks very familiar to him.  He was very scared. He thought it was no big deal...until he followedthem home. The two teenagers MUST do something, and fast!  They must free themselves from the past. Overall, I thought this book was well-written and I hope to read more of Catherine's books.	2001-03-19
