The regular Harry Potter formula is tinkered with quite a bit in this book and I suspect that's the reason some people have taken issue with the book.  Certainly there is a much tigheter focus on character than exploring the magical world this time out.  But rest assured that the story is chock full of whimsy, fantasy, excitement and mystery.<br /><br />After reading the first two pages I was sure it was going to be my favorite book yet and the further along I got, the more confident I became of that assumption.  By the end and it's shocking revelations I knew it was so.  J.K. is an amazing talent and The Half-Blood Prince is her best work yet.	2005-08-09

Find out more about the life of the Wicked Witch of the West?  Well sign me up!  But unfortunately this isn't the witch from the famous movie or even the witch from the classic book.  Maguire has taken the names and places of those beloved stories and twisted them to fit his own ideas.  It's not what I was expecting and it's not how the book is presented.<br /><br />Once I realized this I decided to try and go with it and just enjoy the ride, trouble was there is very little to enjoy in this dreary and plodding story.  There is no whimsy, fantasy or sense of wonder in the book in their place we are given political conspiries, genocide, holy wars and a world that is literally falling apart.<br /><br />There are many interesting and intriguing ideas in the book, but ultimately they don't go anywhere.  The friendship between Glinda and Elfaba ends abruptly without illuminating much of anything in either character, Elfaba's passions are never understood and the mystery of the Wizard and his book is never explained.  Upon finishing the book I felt cheated.  Here I was investing in these characters and their situations and almost nothing is resolved or understood at the end.  The point becomes Maguire's vague attempts to speak of the nature of evil.  Sorry but there are much more entertaining ways to do that than by offering readers hlaf a story.<br /><br />Ultimately Wicked is wicked to it's readers by not offering any kind of meaningful end.  We are left hanging.  The Yellow Brick Road leads to . . . nowhere.	2005-08-08

People who are only familiar with the newest incarnations can learn how it all started and long time fans will appreciate having a complete chronological account of the phenomonon.  The book starts right where it should - before the original toy line or TV show and eplains the history of the Transformers homeworld Cybertron and the beginning of the war between the Autobots and Decepticons.  What follows is a detailed examination/explanation of EVERY incarnation of the Transformers up to and including Energon.  Character bios, selected show synopsis, toy descriiptions and inner workings of key players are all covered and supported by detailed artwork and photographs.  Multiple pages are givin to the Japanese toy line and continunity as well as the US and UK comics, including the latest from Dreamweave.  What more could you ask for?<br />Before reading this book I was skeptical about it's ablity to cover the entire Transformers universe with the detail it demands.  Now that I've read all 141 pages, it has become a jewel in my Transformer collection.  For once the title  \\"Ultimate Guide\\" has been used appropriately!	2004-06-05

I bought it maily for the nostalgia factor since the dioramas on the backs of the G1 toy boxes are included.  You also get 61 stickers of many G1 Transformers.  The book has spaces for 27 of the stickers and gives a short description of the character next to each sticker.  I guess you are supposed to stick the remaining 34 stickers on the diorama pages (four of them one page each) to \\"create your own Transformer adventures.\\"  The stickers are mainly the pics from the covers on the G1 toy boxes with a few artist renderings and Dreamweave designs.<br />I wish the book were longer (it's only 7 pages long) and used more of the included 61 stickers.  Also there is too much focus on Optimus Prime (8 stickers).  I would have liked a wider range of the G1 series covered (the only charactes from the third season are Hot Rod and Ultra Magnus).  I suspect children 5 - 8 will enjoy this most if they even are familiar with G1 Transformers.	2004-06-05

Like TOY STORY for farm animals, SunBirds takes you into the secret world of farmyard peacocks.  At first life is just as you'd expect.  Chicks are born and begin learning about the world, which teaches the reader about a Peacocks daily life, a little chick confuses its human keeper as its parent.  It can be a bit too cute and overly simplistic at times but remember this is a children's story.  Then out of nowhere, the story twists away from this farming saga and turns into a sci/fi battle for survival.  And what a battle it is!  Turns out supposedly benign everyday creatures are capable of science and technology and have decided they want to dominate the planet.  It's up to our heroes the Peacocks to band together and save the planet by phasing in and out of different dimensions.  You've got to give the author credit for this premise.  I can't ever remember hearing a plot like this!<br />SunBirds is an entertaining and well paced story that left me wanting more.  I was very happy to see that the battle doesn't involve guns and blowing things up but using their technology cunningly and covertly fighting their enemy with wits much more than brawn.  A.A. Browne has also left the door wide open for allegory.  It all depends on the path the resulting books take.<br />If you never looked at toys the same way after seeing TOY STORY SunBirds will have the same affect on you but with farm animals.  I can't wait to read the second volume!	2004-03-24

I'll admit I was initially drawn to it because it was on sale, but upon leafing through it I was impressed with its layout, design and ease on the eyes.  I ordered one from Amazon (which was cheaper than the bookstore even on sale) in the next few days.<br />I'm so happy I did because this is the best dictionary I've used.  It's so easy to search through mainly because of one important detail - color.  The words are not just bolded, but bolded in green while the definitions are in black.  This makes the word you are looking for pop out at you.  Also there are many pictures and pages upon pages of language, its history and roots.  Perusing all this added information is fascinating as well as educational.  It's obvious from the amount of detail that much care has been put into this dictionary.  It's begun me on a journey of appreciating language in a way I never would have ever considered before.	2004-02-20

Again we've got some new interesting technology that escapes our protagonists control and wrecks havoc, teaching us all that there are some things we shouldn't meddle with.<br />Frankly we've read this all before.  From Crichotn and countless other suspense stories.  After reading the first 30 pages or so I got that awful feeling that I could tell exactly where the story was going, and dag gone it if I wasn't right.  Crichton's writing is competant but it felt like his heart wasn't in the project.  There are two suspenseful moments in the story but they could have been more suspensful if we actually cared for the characters involved.  All in all it looks quite obvious that Crichton writes Hollywood screenplays more than a novels these days.<br />Crichton's biggest mistake is relating much of the ending right at the beginning.  By having the main character tell the story to us as if it all happend a few months ago we're alerted to the fact that he's surrvived.  In a paragraph before the novel proper starts, we're even givin a brief glimpse of how the story winds up.  These techniques strip much of the suspense and intrigue from the story.<br />Prey is a very quick and easy read.  A McDonlad's hamburger when I expected a more nutrious meal from this gifted writer.	2004-01-04

Just don't expect it live by it's tag line &quot;A fair and balanced look at the right&quot;.<br />Al Fraken is a very good political comedy writer.  And taking the book on these terms it works very well.  Things begin to get muddled when Al starts making serious allegations against such institutions as CNN, The New York Times and Time magazine.  The picture he paints is a bleeak one.  Essentially he is saying that we can't trust our newspapers, magazines, news broadcasts and especially our politicians when they are talking about politics because they are all lying to us.  Maybe it's true, but the comical tone undercuts these intriguing ideas.<br />Al knows his comedy weakens his stance and even plays into it.  This tactic left me unsure of how to be consuming the book, comedy - or serous attack.  Now that I've finished the book it's obvious Al Fraken wants it both ways.  Sorry to say, it doesn't gel into a masterwork.  Taken as a political comedy sketch though it's a laugh riot.  Approach the book from that angle and all liberals (and maybe even some conservatives) will enjoy it.  Hopefully some other less comical writer can tackle the seroius allegations Al Fraken makes.	2004-01-04

Here are some of the ares covered:<br />- The evolution of the format<br />- How DVD works<br />- What aspect ratios are and why they're important<br />- Explains the different sound formats on DVD<br />- Explanation of Region Codes<br />The great thing about this information is it's either in the past or standard to DVD so it's not likely to change.  This will be useful info through the life of the DVD format.<br />Next on the list is a discussion on setting up a home theater.  Everything is covered from recievers, speakers, DVD player, TV even the cables you'll need and best style of room.  They're honest in how much this is going to cost and separate the guidelines into four price ranges.  It helps to keep the book current in passing years by not talking about specific brands, but features that are important.<br />As a way of describing the process of how a DVD special edition is created, the book then goes into an in-depth interview with the creator of the ALIENS QUADRILOGY set due later this year.  It's a fascinating look at the hard work and amount of time invloved in creating a truly comprehensive set.  Some might find it a bit distasteful that this section is all about a specific DVD, but in focusing on one you get a full picture of the process.<br />After all this great information we get the least helpful (and by far the largest) section of the book - DVD reviews.  They offer things like the best DVD sets ever, best sci-fi movies on DVD, best dramas on DVD etc.  All this information though in-depth can be found on their web site and many others for free.  I read 4 or 5 of these and skipped the entire section.<br />The book redeems itself near the end when it discusses teh future of DVD.  Namely HD DVD, recordable DVD and high resolution audio.  This section helps you get a handle on the near future of the format, but is also the sectin with the thinnest information since they of course can not predict the future.<br />I'd reccomend this book to those interested in creating a home theatre and those interested in learning a bit of the technical side of the DVD format.  The book is most hurt by the lenghty DVD reviews that add little to the books value but much to it's length.he sectin with the thinnest information since they of course can not predict the future.<br />I'd reccomend this book to those interested in creating a home theatre and those interested in learning a bit of the technical side of the DVD format.

It spices up a book that any reader of previous guides will need to keep them interested.  Although all the rides, hotels and areas of the parks are covered there's just not that much specifically 'gay' to write about.  For gays who are going to one of the parks for the first time, this book might be helpful in choosing a hotel to stay at, but only in conjuction with another guide as the reviews are very brief.<br />My favorite part of the book is the Compare & Contract appendix which describes the similarties and/or differencees between rides that are at more than one park.  But like most features in this book, I wish it went in to more depth.<br />Also fun are the 'Fairy Facts' that are sprinkled thoughout the book.  Did you know that Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Disneyland was originally supposed to be where Pirates of the Caribbean is located now?  Long time Disney enthusiats and triva buffs will get off on 'Fairy Facts'.<br />It's obvious that Epstein & Shapiro throughly enjoy the Disney parks, yet they're not timid in saying what they think of an attraction.  Example: they quite accurately re-name Superstar Limo (from California Adventure) Supersucky Lame-o.<br />All in all the book has something to offer most Disney visitors (gay or not), but not enough to cater to any specific segment.  Newbies will be frustrated at the lack of depth, but appreciate the authors honest opinions.  Long time guests will have to make due with triva and a snappy sense of humor.  The book is best enjoyed in conjunction with another more comprehensive guide.	2003-05-24

It's all about longing for a girl, finding the girl, getting the girl, having sex with the girl, eating helpless human victims AND proving your manliness buy weilding money, power and big guns. It all got to be a bit too much for me.  How many times do I really want to read about Dragons having sex?  Not many.  I kept wondering if people are really turned on by this type of thing or was I just missing something.<br />Ultimately, I don't know and the story is so lightweight that bigger issues don't matter.  This is the equivelant of a blokbuster summer movie.  One cool idea (shape-shifting dragons living amongst us) made to be not as interesting as you thought because of the been-there-done-that feel of the story.  There are similarities in feel to Anne Rices' work, but this is a copy of her formula and doesn't take it anywhere that it hasn't been already.<br />That said.  This is well written in the sense that I was made to like Dela Sangre eventhough he's basically an oversexed, self centered bore who'd rip open my gut and eat me alive.  For to have ANY like for a guy with those traits not only says something about me but the ability of the writer as well.	2003-05-10

The illustrations meld perfectly with the story.  The story itself is imaginative and can be read on many different levels.  There is something here for all readers.

The future world Cory Doctorow creates is very believable and you can easily see it blossoming from our presant.  Perhaps it's that quality that will grab the sci/fi crowd, but to me the real winning idea is setting the entire thing in Walt Disney World.  Now that's an inspired idea!  And one that not only gives the story character but an immediate refrence for readers.<br />The story itself is a mix of sci/fi, mystery and character drama.  Each one of those genres has it's formulas that they can fall into.  By combining them, Doctorow escapes their traps and creates something very unique and memorable.  Memorable in the sense of the delimas his characters face becasue fo the world they inhabit.  If it's that plausible a future, shouldn't we ponder these questions as well?<br />I'll be recommending 'Down and out in the Magic Kingdom' to all my fellow Disney fans as well as those that want an enjoyable read that also offers something to think about afterwards.	2003-03-08

This isn't a typical making-of book where the author tells you step by step how the fim was created.  Instead we get many short essays from the creators of the film themselves telling their experiences on making Lilo & Stitch.  It's a terrific idea that reminds us of the human element in creating a film.  Even better, the essays seem genuine and give us little insights into the mind of the individual creator as well as the Disney corporation.  Generous amouns of pre-production art is sprinkled throughout the book and I'm going to buy a second copy to frame a few of them.<br />If you have any interest in Disney, animation in general or Lilo & Stitch you will definitely get something worthwile out of this book.  I'm actually axiously looking forward to the next making-of book from Disney again!  Life is good.	2003-02-15

Well I got that partly, but I enjoyed it more for it's portrayal of early Hollywood.  Hearing stories like Davies and Clarke Gable ditching the debut of Gone With The Wind (it was too long) to make prank calls are too good to pass up.<br />On the surface, Davies seems to have a terrific life of parties, fashion, socialites and more than enough money to spare.  But then you realize that she didn't particularly like making movies, hobknobbing with world leaders or going places that Mr. Hearst did.  She was just a slightly ditzy girl wanting to romp and have a good time.  I felt sorry for most of the time and it got a bit depressing.  But it's her free spirited nature that makes to book as enjoyable as it is.  Although,I must admit to putting it down to read something a bit more substantial a few times.	2002-10-19

From simple things like keyboard shortcuts to more complex functions, the information is easy to find, understand and excute.  Jim Elferdink and David Reynolds have certainly done their homework and present it in a very approachable way.  By following their step by step guide for setting up a music database, I had mine all set to go and was discovering new things on my own (like adding a customized photo) all in about an hour.<br />I also found out that I can create Powerpoint-like presentations and html web pages in addition to word processing, databases, spreadsheets and drawing.  Now I don't feel so bad in not buing Office V.X and will probably never miss it!<br />One part of the book that I use often is Appendix A.  It lists the meanings and functions of EACH menu item in EVERY Apple Works module.  For a newbie it's a godsend to have all that information in one place instead of trying to remember where you read what 'Mount iDisk' means and how to activate it.  I imagine it would be helpful for even experienced uses as there are SO many menu files.<br />If you want to learn how to do something in AppleWorks, pick up this book.  Not only will you find out how to do it, but you'll have fun and probably learn something else along the way.	2002-04-13

It ceases to be the demanding, searing, opening love of God.  It has become instead the perfume of human respectability, sprinkled on the cesspools of human negativity.<br />- Religion almost inevitably tries to take our anxiety away from us by claiming that which religion can never deliver - absolute certainty.<br />These are just a few of the many passages I highlighted when reading this volume.  A book that I\\"m sure to read again and again for a different point of view, one that talks about the Bible not as a devinely inspired, unchanging thing, but as a tome that was written by men of their time trying to convey the deep meaning of the life altering experiences they encountered.  A must read for it's measured, thoughtful, direct and stance.<br />Since reading this book two weeks agao I've been wondering why I hold certain beliefs, pondering new meanings and finding new insights.  In short Spong has done something no other Priest or theologian has done for me in a LONG time - he's got me thinking about the Bible and my relation to it on a daily basis.	2002-04-13

It was also my first gay novel.  This story of a recently outed gay man who is accused of murder gave me my first tiny clues as to what gay life is and how the coming out experience can be handled.  Strange, huh?  Who'da thunk it?  Nevertheless, it made a real impression on me and I hold this book in special place becasue of it.<br />The story is engaing, quickly paced and full of suspence as well as the intcracies of coming out in very public and private ways.  I'll always remember the secret meeting that opens the novel as one of the most suspensful things I've read (probaly due to it's gay context and my state of mind at the time).  Zimmerman keeps the mystery itslef engaging and quite difficult to solve.  Although I was focused on other aspects of the story :) I was kept gussing who the murderer could be until the very end.<br />If you're a fan of the series, you have to read this to see how it all started and if not, well this is a perfect time to get hooked.  I give it 4 four stars because my state of mind when first reading it has clouded my critical eye a bit.  But no matter, you are in store for a treat, in so many respects.	2002-01-25

This first chapter (in a three chapter sequal) to The Dark Knight Returns doesn't really measure up to the originals briliance.  The central theme of &quot;Where are our heros?&quot; gives Miller license to use other Justice League members, but it detracts from Batman's presence in his own story.  This theme has been tackled many times over, so what held me (and what I believe this story is all about), was Miller's takes on the different characters.  I don't want to reveal the characters used and how they're ifferent, but it's big thrill for long time comic readers to see their heros in this new light.  This type of story doesn't lend itself to the deep character study and reinvention we got with DKR.  The Dark Knight Strikes Again seems designed as an adrenaline rush for fans of lot's of action and the Justice League characters rather than for the larger mass audience that DKR reached.<br />Aside from the not to original story, I also didn't care for the drawing and coloring styles.  Miller's rough, sketchy drawings take some getting used to and I had to ponder over a few panels to figure out what they were depicting.  What makes it even harder is the computer coloring that overpowers and distracks from many of the drawings.  The contrast of the orgainic feel of the drawings and the percise, mechanied coloring does comment on the story, but unfortunately it's not attractive to look at.  The warm, pastels of DKR worked much better with Miller's drawing style.<br />I plan on reading the other two volumes of this story in the belief that it will be entertaining to see Miller's takes on the Justice League characters.  But overall, my expectationcs have been taken down quite a bit.  DKSA feels like Miller taking advantage of the idea of a sequal to produce a rush for comics fans rather than truly having something to say about the Batman character (and comics in general).  Something that could reach out beyond comics to touch a mass audience.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not nearly as grand as DKR.d thing, but it's not nearly as grand as DKR.	2001-12-29

Somehow a person reading to you, acting out the parts, can make stories come alive more than just reading to yourself.  The experience can make old stories seem fresh and filled with new life.  This is what I've experienced evererytime I've listened to this astonishing preformance.<br />In my house, it has become a Christmas Eve tradition to dim the lights, snuggle up in a blanket, grab some hot chocalate and put on these CDs.  Patrick Stewart reads Charles Dicken's &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; with such heart, spirit and vigor that you cant help but get caught up in it all again!  With only the sound of his voice (there is very little in the way of sound effects) he is able to bring to life not only the entire cast of characters, but the world he's reading about as well.  While listening I swear I can smell the turkey and pies at Fuzziwiggs pary, feel the cold of Scooges Home and hear the laughter and clamour going on in the streets on Christmas Day.<br />Some things deserve to be cherished and experienced again and again.  This is one of them.	2001-11-19

Ok, here's the situation, I had a job interview that required I take a proficiency test using power point and I'd never used the program before.  At first I feaked when they told me, but then I ran out and grabbed a copy of this book with the hopes that it would help me not make a complete fool out of myself.  Following along with the book on my notebook, I had no trouble understanding things from basics to more advanced techniques (like posting presentations on the internet).  The witty voice and cartoons that the 'Dummies' books are famous for kept me alert and interested in moving forward.  I never felt like I was being talked down to and was suprised to find myself enjoying the process!  One thing I really appreiated is they give you multiple ways of preforming the same task, so you can choose which is best for you (also on these job proficiency tests they sometimes like to have you do it their way, so you better know more than one way to do things).<br />One week later I took the test, scored a 90% and was offered the position.  Thank you Doug Lowe!	2001-11-03

If you want stationary with personality, you can't go wrong with this delightful package.  There are 6 different full-color designs to choose from.  What makes this package stand out from the crowd however, is that the stationary is its own envelope as well!  All you do is fold on the scored locations, moisten the two edges, seal, address and, Boom!, you're ready to send it off!  Children will love it and all the adults I have sent one to have gotten a kick out of it as well.  The place for the return address is a bit small, but that is a very minor quibble.  Get this very affordable, inventive and fun stationary for your family and/or friends.  You won't regret it.	2001-07-10
US	50652033	R22DGBN4VCAP3D	0375755284	874264024	The Making of 2001: A Space Odyssey (Modern Library Movies)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A Great Glimpse into the Past	This small 300 page book offers an intriguing glimpse into the past in which 2001 was made.  The title is a bit misleading as the focus here isn't on the actual production of the film and the nature of it's construct, but an examination of the period which developed it.  It's quite facinating and offers intriguing new tidbits of information.  The book presents the original Arthur C. Clarke short stroy on which the film is based, The Sentinal, in it's entirety giving insight as to how much had to be extrapolated from it to make a feature.  Other highlights are; a production calander wich details not only script writings and screenings, but significant scientific developments as well (such as the first space walk, the launching of probes), essays on the building of the various ships, a discussion of the special effects, testimonies from various scientists, consultants, art directors and more on their experiences with the film, the full original press release, multiple reviews from 1968-69, and interviews with Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick himself.  What more could you ask for?  It's breathtaking!  I'm confounded by some the the harsher reviews.  So much is presented, all in one book, that this is easily the most complete collection of information on 2001 : A Space Odyssey I've ever come across.<br />The book succeeds in giving the reader a sense of time and placement in history for 2001 as well as revealing some of the production secrets and offering some film analyzation.  The film reviews alone were incredible in their revelation of reactions to the film.  If you want to more about the actual process of the 2001 production, Filming The Future by Piers Bizony is a better choice.  Get this book for a clear understanding of where 2001 came from, how it came to be and what effect it had.  If you come to it with this in mind, I'm sure any film fan, and certainly any 2001 fan, will be blown away by the amount of information and insight presented.  Don't pass this up!up!	2001-07-10

However, this small childrens book offers all the detail and backstory to Queen Amidala that was missing in the film.  We learn how this 14 year old got to be Queen, the names of her handmaidens and advisors, and most interestingly, the significance of her unusual makeup.  All this is presented with beautiful, bright, color pictures, and text that is easy for young readers to comprehend.  The clever set up, that Queen Amidala told this story to Alica Alfonsi (the author) who just transcibed it for our enjoyment makes it seem all the more real.  This book accomplishes something the film doesn't even pretend to care about, making Queen Amidala human, a person we care about.  I recomend this to anyone who liked the film, or is interested in learning more about Amidala.  No matter their age.	2001-07-04

You can't get more complete than covering EVERY SINGLE episode of a series' 7 year run.  This companion does that and manages to keep things entertaining.  The book is broken down by season and each section starts off with a review of the season and gives insight on why things progressed as they did.  I missed some of the later episodes of the series and would get the many character relationships and goings on confused.  This companion has made it all crystal clear by including a synopsis of each episode followed by a lenghty discussion of how it was made.  Terry J. Erdmann was given uprecedented access to cast and crew to give readers inside info on the creation of sets, props, makeup, casting choices, stroy ideas and more.  The information is comprehensive and eye opening with plenty of human interest to keep it entertaining.  Scatterd through out are pictures, drawings, and asides that complement the main text.<br />Yes it would be nice to have color pictures and a hard cover, but I don't think many people would be willing to/able to pay up for that and no fan should miss this comprehensive book.  This is by far the most comprehensive, informative and entertaining TV companion I've ever seen.  Whenever Deep Space Nine makes it to DVD this will be the perfect thing to keep next your armchair.  Believe me, there is so much information you'll be refrencing this companion for a long, long time!	2001-04-19

Jim Henson was one of the most imaginative people of this past century and this book beautifully captures some of his brilliance in the form of sketches, doodles and small art pieces.  If you've ever marveled at his artistry, or wondered at his talent, then this is the book for you.<br />What I most enjoyed about this collection are the sketches and stories from Jim Henson's earliest years and most obscure projects.  Alison Inches has included Jim's cartoons from college, High School program designs, album covers, advertisment ideas and story boards, as well as characters like, Taminella Grinderfall, Thog, Chicken Liver and Baskerville.  Have no fear though, plenty of more widely known projects and characters are featured as well.  We're taken through the steps from Sam and Friends, to the Muppet's succesful commercials, to Rowlf the Dog's appearances on The Jimmy Dean Show, through The Muppet Show and Sesame Street.  Along the way we're also treated to many unrealized puppets and projects.  It's a facinating journey and one that you're sure to revisit many times over.<br />Any designer, puppeteer, artist or Muppet fan will be fasinated by this book.  But don't think you'll be geting a comprehensive career retrospective.  I'd recomend &quot;Jim Henson: The Works&quot; for that.  The focus here is squarely on the creation and design, which is right where it should be and it makes Designs and Doodles the perfect companion piece to Jim Henson: The Works.  One giving you a look at his projects and the other a glimpse into his mind.  And oh, what a marvelous glimpse it is!	2001-04-06

A lot of thought went into presenting this set as AUTHENTIC books from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Both come not only in distressed covers (showing their popularity among the students), but entertaining doodles and asides from Harry and freinds in the columns, forwards from Albus Dumbledore, About the Author segments, Diagon Alley publishing houses and even a library check out form for Quidditch Through the Ages!  Such details along with the already wonderous subject matter only heighten my enjoyment of these books.<br />Rest assured that all the charm and craft found in the series is presented here as well.  You'll learn all about the fantastic Billywig (an insect native to Australia that has not a poisionous sting, but a levitative one) and see how all the differnt balls of Quidditch have evolved over the years.  It might not be the next chapter in Harry's story, but this set is still a sure fire hit with any fan of the series.  It's also a great way to immerse yourself in Harry's world.  And don't forget that part of the profits will benefit Comic Relief UK!  What more can you ask for?	2001-04-02

Tara Bennett-Goleman melds eastern and western ideas into a theroy of self revelaion that is at once simple in it's statements yet deep and meaningful the more you probe the questions and ideas posed.  She writes in a very approchable manner and I never once felt talked down to.  She first offers an in-depth explanation of her ideas of inner peace and how to achive it, then shows you how to apply it to every day issues like breaking bad habits, relationships, findig out where some of your emotions come from, death and spirituality.  There is a wonderful introduction by the Dalai Lama included that sets the stage for the ideas to come.  On a superficial (yet telling) note, the book has a very subdued dust cover, but underneath it comes to life in color and grandeuer.  A marvel to look at!<br />I've gained much insight from this book and am sure to be referring to it again and again.  This is a book everyone should read, but especially if you're interested in growing as a human being and learning just what makes YOU tick.  Are you up to the challenge?	2001-01-24

The quiet power of these tales is as mystifying and timless as the originals from which they are spun.  By recasting and reshaping both favorite and obscure fairy tales from our youth with gay themes, Peter Cashorali has given gay men the myths and legends on which empires are made.  Queit, pensive, reflective, moral, funny, entertaining, sexy, thoughtful and just plain fun are the words I'd use to describe this collection.  The 17 stories are easily read in one sitting (some only a page or two long), but are hard to forget.  I chose to read one a night, right before bed.  If you have a lover, reading them to one another makes for great bedtime stories.  Each is begun with a simple line drawing that forshadows events to come.  A nice design element is each of these drawings are picked up on the jacket cover.  If you happen to not know the tale on which a particular story is based, it is refrenced on the bottom of each stories first page.  This makes it really easy to find and read the original to see just how much Cashorali has reworked it.  I espicially loved the range of gay life portrayed; from girly boys to butch boys, S&amp;M, AIDS, aging, looking for lasting love and dealing with a loss, this book covers it all.  And don't forget the manditory enchanted objects, talking animals, handsome princes, frogs, ogres and withces needed for any good fairy tale!  All are included and no one feels left out.<br />Fairy tales give us a shared history, something to aspire to, and to learn from.  Finally - finally gay men have their own!  I can't recomend this book enough.  We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to Cashorali.  I'm sure the Brothers Grimm would be proud as well.  Buy it and I'm sure you'll savor it's rich tales for years and years to come!	2000-10-18

Well, that's what I tell everyone, but the real reason is that it's just so darn FUN!  Every aspect of this address book oozes quirky, irreverent, fun.  The bold colors and designs grab your attention, but it's the cute and playful retro feel that kept me hooked.  The dividers are strong plastic coated paper with colorful drawings of Mr. Lunch and his antics.  The alphabetical posts are easy to find and sturdy.  Typically you'll have space for 18 names and addresses for each letter.  You also get two lines for phone numbers, a line for a fax number and another for email addresses.  A real cute feature is each entry has a spot to stick a Neo-Print sticker of the person.  I love this feature because it makes it so easy to remember people or a fun time you had with them.  The only thing is if you don't have a sticker of them you'll have to leave the space blank or draw one yourself.  Also included is one sheet of some really cute Mr. Lunch stickers and 6 blank pages for notes.<br />This a perfect address book for home use as it's size and weight make it impractical for traveling.  Besides it looks great on a desk!  The book is sturdy yet the pages easily open on the spiral binding.  I can't think of a better address book for a fun-loving, free-spirited person.  What a delight!	2000-10-03

It's a thrill ride from the beginning and doesn't stop until it's climatic, violent end.  Violent is a key word here.  I wasn't expecting so much guts and filth, but suprisingly most of it  works and gets you to re-think issues of violence in America.  This is the  central point to the novel and for the most part it's presented in a clear  and entertainging way, though I don't agree with all Ben Elton has to say.  The idea that film or art causes violence is not a new idea and not much  new is said about it here.  What Elton has done is to present it in a way  that is eaisly accesible (very movie-like), and most importantly, funny.  The satire and out right humor are, for the most part, right on.  Plenty of  times I laughed from recognition of behavior or a joke.  You can't help but  get involved with these characters and their situations and that's what  makes the politics shine.  One more thing I must mention is the incredible  dust jacket and book design.  What a hoot!  The only thing it is missing is  a popcorn scent in the glue.  It looks GREAT on the bookshelf!	2000-09-14

You get the entire original poem along with a  beautiful presentation.  The poem is very short, but what it lacks in  length it makes up for in style and mood.  From the outset this is a  different kind of book.  There is no binding, instead it is one long sheet  of parer folded back and forth.  This give's the reader the sense they are  reading an authentic Chinese document.  The photos, drawings, sketches, and  Chinese writing inside only heighten this impression.  It's also a  facinating study in how the film was structured.  You can see where Disney  added to the story or left things out, as well as see the the visual  development of Mulan and her world as told by the pre-production art work.  Wthout a doubt, this makes for the best book of a Disney film yet!	2000-09-14

I'm not  sure how much non-fans, and hetero's will appreciate it, but for me it has  been a lifeline!  Anyone who has been through the wringer (and man does Ru  have stories for you), is a drag queen, has a sense of humor (RuPaul is  wickedly funny, though never mean), or wants to learn more about Ru should  pick up this book ASAP.  Ru has been very brave in letting us into his  mind, life and soul.  There are many life lessons to be learned along the  way and a whole mess of laughs too!  What a suprise to find it published by  Disney!  This is also a great how-to-be-a-drag-queen book.  Ru tells ALL her  secrets and gives tips on releaseing the inner drag queen in us all.  Finally he is revelaed to be a person of great strength, integrity, bravery  and also very wise.  I wish we all could be a bit more like \\"little  Ru-Ru\\".  Full of pictures, wit and wisdom this is a MUST buy!	2000-09-14

It's a truly engrosing read that you're sure not forget.  I read it first years ago from the library and  have been looking everywhere to buy a copy for myself!  Only now have I  found it.<br />I was stuck to this book the moment I picked it up and even  now, years later, I still find myself thingking of it!  He deftly belnds  what little fact is known of the Roswell crach and blends it with his own  extrapolations.  What makes the book so remarkable are those  extrapolations.  They seem completely plausible and realistic and are  meticulously thought out.  Every detail seems to make sense and drawns you  further into the world he has created.  Wether any of his extrapolations  are correct is what keeps you thinking about the book.  Trying to figure  out if there was something he forgot or something that just doesn't add up.  If you want an engaging read, one that presents a puzzle to be solved  andtold in the most entertaining and engaging ways, then this book is for  you!	2000-08-15

A more stimulating book I couldn't  imagine!  It's not that it told me so much I didn't know intuitively, but  seeing it written so distinctly in black and white really hit home.  This  is one to read if you really want to get a sense of just how dramatically  the world has changed.  Neal Gabler, tells it like he sees it and has a lot  of research to back up his views.  I love that he doesn't make judgements  or try to press an opinion on the reader.  It's left up to you to decide  how you feel about it all.  I find myself thinking of points he brought up  throught the day and seeing just what he meant by experiencing it in  &quot;real&quot; life.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I  wish it was a bit MORE in-depth.  It's so engaging that I can imagine an  entire college course being made from this book.  It is a book that's as  entertaining as it is informative, and that's the whole point.	2000-08-11
