I won't give away too much of the story, but it focused on a nine year old girl that came up missing after her crack-selling aunt sent her to the store at ten o'clock at night.  Solomon Jones kept me guessing to the very end.  He gives you a cast of colorful characters to choose from:  Aunt Judy that sells her crack out of her house, her boyfriend Sonny that has been rumored to molest young girls, Daneen, the missing girl's(Kenya) mother that ended up getting her daughter taking away from her, Lily, Kenya's best friend mom and Darnell, Kenya's uncle and Kevin Lynch that guy that was asked to help find Kenya.<br />Pick this one and enjoy it today!  The ending will knock your socks off!  Five stars NO DOUBT!	2004-05-01

I had no idea what to expect when I ordered it off line. The first chapter was a little slow and confusing...JUST THE FIRST CHAPTER! But after the first chapter you will indeed need to buckle your seatbelts and get ready for a rollercoaster ride!<br />This was a well written story about three charcters who you will remember long after the story has ended.<br />You have Juanita who is so light she can pass for white, but you better not call her white! She often brags about being a black nubian queen to her peers even though they tease her about looking like a half breed with her fair complexion and green eyes. Juanita does not know who her mother is and has been raised by her grandmother her whole life, but when she finds out who her mother is she will no longer be the confident, proud person of her heritage.<br />Scooter is Juanita's best friend. Scooter is an intelligent, smart, gifted person, that is until he mets a street-talking, thug by the name of Jorge. Your mouth will literally drop when Scooter and Jorge met! DRAMA!<br />Last, but not least you have Conan who is a hard-working man that has nightmares over his brother's death and tries to stay loyal to his best friend, Jorge.<br />This story was so good I would not have had a problem paying full price for it!

Johnson's writing puts you right there on the front seat of the movie. You can visualize everything.<br />I like how he broke this novel up into characters. First, you have Jayson. He's what you consider a good man. Jayson is in love with a woman name Faith. At the beginning I liked Faith. I thought she was a nice woman that deserved a good man like Jayson until her best friend Karen shed some light on her. Karen had a small part in this book, but it was well worth it. I slowly began to hate Faith for the things she did to Jayson. Your mouth will literally drop once you find out her dirty secrets she has been keeping from Jayson. Faith is scandalous with a capital S!<br />Then you have Asha, Jayson's best friend that Faith despies. Asha and Jayson use to be in a relationship. Things didn't work out so they became friends.....best friends. But little Miss Asha isn't too innocent herself. She has been keeping something from Jayson that will change the way he looks at her and what he thinks of her forever. This secret will have a major impact on Asha's life. Jayson was so upset about Asha's secret that he threw her out of of her apartment which happens to be the building he owns.<br />Love Frustration is full of SECRETS, LIES, LOVE, BETRAYAL and MORE SECRETS! I enjoyed this book from the firts page to the last. Boy, was it GOOD! I recommned this book to all book lovers and to those who have an addiction for good books. This one is it. <br />Ummmm....R.M. Johnson when is the next one coming out???! In the meantime while you are writing another bestseller I'll go and purchase the other two books that you wrote....The Harris Men & The Harris Family. You get five stars for this book no doubt. On my way to add you to my favorite author's list. You are up there with the best!!!<br />P.S. You had me on the edge of my seat in the last three chapters!

This story was full of action, drama and hot sizzling [scenes]! EJD sure does know how to create a sex scene. [Those] scenes are always THE BOMB! <br />I thought I had this book figured out, but it ended in a totally different way. I can't choose any favorite characters with this story because I loved them all!<br />Dante- main character that was constantly haunted by his past.<br />Jackson - Dante's best friend. He got a whole lotta problems and often turns to Dante who is younger than him for advice. <br />Robin- Jackson's girlfriend<br />Sabrina - Jackson's baby momma<br />Scamz- the one man that could get you out of trouble and in trouble at the same time. He was like God to some people...they looked up to him. The women worshipped the ground he walked on.<br />Pam- the older woman that Dante fell in love with too fast.<br />Sierra- One of Scamz's women (watch out for this lady)<br />Arizona- One of Scamz's women (watch out for this lady)<br />Big Slim- An old man with a nasty attitude who has a closet full of secrets.<br />Nazario- Dante's worst enemy. (HATED HIM WITH A PASSION)<br />My mouth flew open at some of the crimes they got away with in this book. Even though I knew they were doing wrong I was hoping they wouldn't get caught. The crimes they committ will have you sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails.<br />If you haven't read Thieves Paradise yet...what you waiting on?! It was SOOOOOOOOOO Good!

She goes out of her way to help people especially her family. Lesile is the type of person that minds her own business. In this book she was dealing with so much- her sister has two kids and no good baby daddy, her mom is dying with a deadly disease, her brother is running with the wrong crowd and her father lost his job and left the family. Lesile is more like the mother to her sister and brother. When Lesile finds out she has special powers she started using them and you'll just have to read to see what evil and brutal things she does to people who get in her way!<br />Lesile is the type of person that you start off loving and then end up hating and then loving again.<br />Omar Tyree this was the BEST book I read all year long!!!

I think she was in love with the idea of being loved therefore she would sleep with these guys and think they would love her. BAD CHOICE!<br />I was so glad when this girl finally got it together. The guy that she fell in love has a big secret and I would have never guessed it. I was so shocked! Wil, how could you?!<br />At times, this story moved a little too fast.

The way she acted throughout this kept me laughing.  When she showed up to her daddy's funeral wearing a bright orange miniskirt suit with six inch strap up heels my mouth flew open and all I could say was, \\"NO, SHE DIDN'T!\\"<br />The way these sisters acting planning their daddy's funeral will keep you in shock.  They hardly ever agreed on anything and disagreed on just about everything from what color the flowers would be on the casket to what color suit he should be wearing.<br />Even though Aunt Ida Mae had a short part in this book I really liked her.

Jacqueline Powell did an excellent job telling the story of two people in a relationship. I liked the way this novel was divided into the two main characters Nikai and Robert. At times I was on Nikai's side during their relationship other times I was on Robert's.<br />I felt like I knew Robert and Nikai personally. Nika's mom was a trip and a half and she was also my least favorite character. She was always putting Nikai down and comparing her to her older sister Taylor who you will learn isn't any better than Nikai.<br />Jacqueline's &quot;in your face&quot; writing style makes her stand out above other authors. She is definitely up there with the best!<br />Nikai had alot of personal baggage that she brought to the relationship which made it harder for it to work. Robert was just being a man throughout the story.....he worked, tried to make their relationship the best, but when Nikai didn't pay him attention he ran to the arms of another woman by the name of Karen. Watch out for Karen in this book because she is something else! She has a secret that will blow you away!<br />I will definitely be reading more of this author's work and can hardly wait for her second novel to hit the shelves. Bravo and two thumbs up to Jacqueline you did an excellent job with this story! I HIGHLY recommend this book to book lovers -this is one that you definetly don't wanna miss!	2002-05-25

This is a well written story about drugs, the hood and the GAME! <br />The P*ssy Pound clique was a bunch of females who used their looks and what was between their legs to get what they wanted.  The girls got everything from money, jewerly, expensive clothes and cars.  Their cash flow increased while their character decreased. They did whatever it took to get that money no matter who they hurt.<br />BMC had me shedding tears, drying them and shedding some more. As soon as I got over someone's death in the book then BAM someone else got knocked!<br />Netta would have to be my favorite character even though she did some devious things! I guess my heart went out to her because from the get-go she never really had nothing. She lived in the projects, her mother was a dope fiend and she didn't know who her father was.  On the other hand her best friend Mimi grew with her father and was spoiled rotten.  Black was a character I disliked from the beginning, but towards the end of the book I HATED him!<br />Shannon Holmes and Terri Woods you both did a great job with this story.

Ruthie never knew her mother, but she did see her a few times when she was young. <br />Ruthie lived with her grandmother who was abused by her husband-Ruthie's stepgrandfather. After Ruthie's grandmother died she was left to the brutal hands of her stepgrandfather. He beat her for every little thing that she did and used her as his personal slave.  The way he treated Ruthie made me cry-I started to really hate this man!  I kept saying to myself when is things going to go good for this girl.  She met this guy name Ray who changed her whole world then her grandaddy got sick and who did everbody call on---GAL?! After everything this man had put her through Ruthie and her family moved back to her hometown to take care of this man.  He still treated her like nothing and she was the ONLY one taking care of him!<br />This story made me cry more than laugh.

The title and the cover is what caught my eyes. I am so glad I decided to order this book - it was really a good book!<br />Love Ghosts is about three sisters Sharon(crybaby), Debra(the strong one- at the beginning that is) and Linda(who really had nothing in common with her sisters) The author tells the story about the sister's past relationships up until their present ones. Sharon met Gary is who was her first love, he taught her the meaning of love and then something terrible happen! (It brought tears to my eyes......) Then you have Debra who was the oldest and she had a love ghost (Marcus) that had been haunting her for a long time. She really loved Marcus with all her heart and too much if you ask me! This man took her through alot! I grew mad at her towards the end for the decisions she choose to make. Then you have Linda who used men to get over the fact that her Daddy walked out on their family. Linda constanly let men use her in any way they wanted to, to feel the void of losing her dad. At the end she will meet this man that made her the way she is......Will she forgive him and learn to love again?<br />These three sisters went through ALOT, but they were always there for each other in a time of need. The only thing I did not like about this book was that at times I felt like the author was rushing the story a little. One minute one of the sisters was having stomach pains and cravings the next she was in the hospital having a baby! (Come on now) But don't let that peeve stop you from reading this book. It was an enjoyable read and I will be reading more from this author in the future.

I recently read A Day Late and A Dollar Short, I enjoyed it so much I went and bought this one. I am so glad I did!  I thought her latest one was good, but Disappearing Acts put the icing on the cake!<br />Terry McMillian writes and you instantly become a fly on the wall. Her writing style is so raw, honest and to-the-point! She is my favorite female author!<br />I am instantly became friends with Zora and Franklin as they let me take peek into their lives. Zora was a strong black woman, but when it came to Franklin she melted like butter. She stuck with him through the good times and the bad. When Franklin didn't have a pot to (go to the rest room in) in and a window to throw it out she was right there. Sometimes I couldn't understand why a beautiful, intelligent woman like Zora that had so much going for herself would want a married, alcholic and uneducated man like Franklin bringing her down. But that is how it is when love comes into the picture. Now Frankiln was a good man, but when he was down and out he brought others along with him. I didn't like the fact that when times got hard he always took it out on the one person that was sticking it out with him --his woman! Even though I loved Zora and Franklin together, I think they are better apart. Franklin has alot of growing up to do and he needs to understand life ain't always peaches and cream!<br />Disappearing Acts easily gets five stars and I HIGHLY recommend book lovers to read this one! I liked this one out of all of her books! Pick this one up today you'll be glad you did!	2002-01-26

This was my first time reading something from this author and I must say I was very impressed! This book took me on an emotional rollercoaster ride. I caught myself laughing out loud, crying and talking to the characters. I felt like I was a fly on the wall as Carl Weber took me into the lives of four best friends. Kyle was the peacemaker of the four. He was married to a white woman, but at times he felt embarrassed being with her. Wil was married to a woman who couldn't keep a secret to save her life. Wil's friends confided in him with their deepest secrets and thoughts. He confided in his wife Diane and she made her business to tell everyone which caused more drama than a little! Allen(momma's boy) was the weaker of the bunch he let his money-hungry girlfriend take advantage of him time after time. I found myself screaming at him more than any of the characters to stop being a fool! His girlfriend Rose was nothing more than a SCANDALOUS and triflin golddigger who did whatever it took to keep her pockets fat. Last you have Jay who was my favorite character because his life was like an episode of the Real World mixed with a little Ricki Lake and topped with sprinkles of the Jerry Springer show! Jay was married, but by all the ladies he had in and out of his life one couldn't tell. Lying was natural to Jay and he seem to like living his life on the edge. These four guys really had a strong bond between them because no matter what happen they ALWAYS was there for each other! Married Men was a PAGE TURNER and I highly recommend all book lovers read it!<br />Carl Weber is now my favorite male author! Once you expereincce Carl Weber you too will agree that he is best male author out today! He has literary magic that flows smoothly and keeps you wanting more! I can hardly wait for his next novel Baby Mama Drama, I read a sample chapter of it at the end of Married Men and I can tell already it is going to be OFF THE CHAIN! Carl Weber, you have a new fan and I am on my wayto pick up your first novel Lookin For Luv. Married Men easily gets five stars and deserves more!!!! This one is MUST READ especially for women who want a peek inside what goes on in a man's mind!	2001-12-27

This was my first novel my Kimberla Roby and it was a very intertesting read. I really enjoyed the story! Casting The First Stone was about a man name Curtis who was called to preach. He was the pastor of a large church. Curtis took his position and turned it around to fit his needs and wants. He got up in the puplit every Sunday preaching the word and behind closed doors he was having not one, but two affairs on his wife, he was physically abusive to her and he was using the money of the church to do UNGODLY things for his mistresses.<BR>Tanya his wife tried to put up with Curtis for as long as she could then she herself lost faith in God and also did some things that God would not be pleased with.<br />Even though this book was fiction I truly believe some of the things are happening in churches today. This novel was between and a 4.0 and 4.5. Thank you Kiimberla for a insightful read! I will be reading more work from you in the future!	2001-12-12

I love the characters Mrs. Parks choose to use to tell this story. <br />You have Mia a beautiful young woman who dreams of having a black knight in shining armor which turns out to be Brice. Brice is controlling, possessive and very jealous. I know hate is a strong word to use, but I truly hated this man for what he put Mia through. He treated her like his child rather than his wife! Then you have Christian his best friend and adopted brother who adds more drama to this story than a little! In my opinion Brice never deserved a woman like Mia. She was too good for him. He treated her like NOTHING and she treated him like EVERYTHING.<br />This story has became one of my favorites and is a MUST READ! It really open my eyes to a world I have never experienced. The Ties That Bind will have you turning page after page to see what happens next and the characters will stay with you long after you have finished the book.<br />Go get this one you will not be disappointed!	2001-11-29

Usually when I order or buy a book I always read maybe two or three pages then come back to it later. With this book I started at 9:30 that night and by 3:15 that morning I was finished!!! Shades Of Jade was a good book!!!!!! I kept saying to myself I'll just read this chapter and put it down. I couldn't put this book down until page 245 which is the last page!<br />Shades Of Jade is about a woman (Marissa) that only dates married men for her own personal reasons. Her best friend Charmaine dislikes her lifestyle and constantly warns her that: ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU'RE GONNA MESS WITH THE WRONG WOMAN'S HUSBAND! Marissa ignores her best friend until she starts receiving threatening phone calls, hang ups and disturbing letters.  By Chapter four I thought I knew who the stalker was, but as the plot thicken I wasn't sure. When I finally find out who it was I was totally SUPRISED! In a million of years I would have never guess the stalker..........NEVER!<br />Gloria, you did a EXCELLENT job on writing this book! This book is full of DRAMA, LIES AND SUSPENSE! This book will keep you turning the pages until you are finished! I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone you will be in for a suprise by the end!<BR>This book deserves more than five stars just for the ending......<BR>My mouth is still opened from who the stalker was!!!!!!!!<br />GO GET THIS ONE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPONITED!!!	2001-11-17

This book was very well written and it was worth the wait! I love the characters Terry choose to use for this book. I almost thought she knew some of my family members for a minute.<br />Viola was the mother that told it like it was whether your feelings got hurt or not. (sounds like my grandma)Cecil was her husband who loved her dearly, but did not feel appreciated so he left and found him a young woman in the projects with kids! Lewis was the son who kept ending up in jail and every time according to him it was never his fault. Paris(&quot;Miss Perfect&quot;)and the favorite child according to everybody is always to everybody's rescue, but her own. I felt sorry for her at times because she kept her problems bottled up so she could help her siblings with theirs. Janelle the baby of the family had some serious issues in this book with her teenage daughter that will bring tears to your eyes. AND Charolette MY FAVORITE character who had nothing in common with her family, but blood. Charolette was just like her mom telling people off and not caring about their feelings. Charolette and her mom did not get along in my opinion because they were too much alike!!!<br />Terry, you did a wonderful job writing this book. I laughed and cried throughout this book. The only thing I did not like about this book is that it had to come to an end!!! Terry, PLEEEEEASE DON'T KEEP ME WAITNG TOO LONG FOR YOUR NEXT NOVEL! I would give you more than five stars for this book if I could. (**********)<br />I recommend this book to everyone you will not be disappointed!!!	2001-11-15

I was wishy washy about getting this book, but once I started to read this book it was GOOD! I loved the theory Genie had with men, but once David came on the scene he changed her way of thinking. In my opinion I think David was just bored with his dead end marriage and he saw something interesting in Genie. He wasn't as serious about her as she was about him. I didn't really like David's character because he was unsure of what he wanted. The ending to this book really suprised me....I was like WHAT!!!	2001-10-22

US	41860696	R1TPHGGNZRJNPH	0525946039	149958128	Between Lovers	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Three people sharing one bed...	This novel was about two people in love with the same woman who in my opinion loves neither. Nicole the main character is a straight up self-centered woman. She leaves her man of SEVEN years on their wedding day at the altar and then gives him one option.....in order to be with her he has to accept her girlfriend Ayanna. She uses them both at her advantage ONLY! She controls them with what is between her legs and like obedient dogs with their tongues out they submit! I felt for Vincent at time because he was one WEAK black man. Some would say he was in love, some would say he was whipped I would say he was a FOOL! <br />Even though I did not like Nicole I tip my hat off to her because she was one powerful...! This book had a sad ending. Even though Vincent FINALLY woke up and moved on I think he still wants, needs and loves Nicole. (Sadly to say)<br />This is Eric Jerome Dickey at his best. He writes with so much emotion the reader can feel it!! I love the style of writing he choose to use with this book. I would recommend this book to everyone!I would rate this book more than five stars (*******) EJD, you get two snaps and a hand clap ONCE AGAIN! Thank You!depth of love for Nicole..............absolutely ANYTHING was possible for him. Was it intense?  Without a doubt............but intensity is what you make it.<br />Could EJD have done some things differently or told the story more to my liking?  Maybe....maybe not............nonetheless it doesn't take away the level of creativity that EJD has to bring to his market of contemporary AA fiction.  I believe that he touched on a subject that might be a little too close for comfort for some and non-affecting for others.  Yet and still, it was intensly bold and very much an interesting read.	2001-10-18

Eric Jerome Dickey did a wonderful job writing this bold and sassy novel. Vincent and Dana started their relationship off with lies. Vincent was still in love with his ex wife therefore he could not love Dana 100% and Dana thinks by moving to a new city her love for her ex will be forgotten. NOT TRUE AT ALL. You see when you start off a new relationship and your heart is still with another it will never work. Your heart has to heal. You wonder why is he not being affectionate, why is she not giving me her all....why, why, why. Because their hearts are with someone else.  This book is for all book lovers who is with someone physically, but not emotionally. I give this book five stars and a PLUS! Keep up the good work Eric Jerome Dickey! Two snaps and a hand clap. BRAVO!	2001-10-14

The term &quot;passing&quot; in this book referred to black people who were light enough to pass for white and sad to say some of the tried.  Eulie Giles was the stepmother who brought her children up the wrong way. She taught them to accept people by the color of their skin, family background, social status and income. I really enjoyed reading this book it was touching. The ending made tears come to my eyes and really suprised me! If you are thinking about getting this one do your self a favor and do so. It will bring unexpected pain, tears and joy. Thanks Patricia Jones for a insightful read!	2001-10-14
