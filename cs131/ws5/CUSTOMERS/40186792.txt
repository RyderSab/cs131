Buy the complete Portable MBA Series. There are many more, but you only need these 8:  <br />-   the portable  MBA (start with this one) <br />-\\" \\"   finance/accounting. <br />-\\" \\"   entrepreneurship <br />-\\" \\"   marketing <br />- \\" \\"  management <br />- \\" \\"   strategy <br />- \\" \\"   investments <br />- \\"  \\"  economics <br /> <br />You probably think I'm joking. <br /> <br />I'm not. <br /> <br />The wealth of information here will blow you away. <br /> <br />Be a smart and consider it all as an investment. <br /> <br />Anyways, top b schools cover all the topics listed above. <br /> <br />2. Suscribe to the Economist. <br /> <br />I suscribe to dozens of business periodicals, but the Economist is global in scope. <br /> <br />Remember that word - global. <br /> <br />You'll hear it a lot in Business school should you decide to go. <br /> <br />3. Read Thomas Friedman's new book: THE WORLD IS FLAT. I read over 300 business books a year (on average one a week) and this is so far the best book I've read in 2005. <br /> <br />Get this: Business Week polled some of the top B school professors in the nation and they all said they were planning on reading this over the summer. <br /> <br />I'll let you decide. <br /> <br />4. Be thankful you have the internet at your disposal.  <br /> <br />Our parents did not have such a luxury as Google, Investopedia, or Wikipedia. <br /> <br />Read everthing related to business, finance, econ, marketing, technology, media, wall street, stock markets, venture capitalism, & the internet. <br /> <br />That means blogs, too... <br /> <br />5. Get cable and watch either CNNfn, CNBC, or Bloomberg as much as you can. <br /> <br />Even if you're busy, leave it on and let that juice seep into the subconscious. <br /> <br />Use discipline + never change the channel to watch what the rest of America watches. <br /> <br />So there you go.	2005-07-16

It is hard for a non-MBA to review the book, being that my only understanding of what goes on in MBA halls is based on my friend's stories and the plethora of business books I've read.    However, I can say that the book covers most of the topics being discussed in classrooms today.    What I find most convinient is the ease with which the authors handle the business language. Furthermore, the book is tightly organized, starting out with a basic review of macro/micro economics.    I think even someone just looking for a basic understanding of business and economic phenomena will take away a lot from this book.	2005-06-15

I've read dozens and dozens of financial advice and self-help books. Most stink; a handful will blow you away.    The best one for me, and by extension, my clients, remains Ric Edelman's THE TRUTH ABOUT MONEY. If you haven't read this mega book, you're losing out. Buying it may be the best investment you make this year.    Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, so the problem with these books is that you'll often get reams of conflicting advice. Best bet is to pick up several of the best sellers and read 'em with highlighter in hand.    They all revolve around the same theme: building wealth, paring down debt, and protecting your asets.    The issue is how objective the authors remain and whether or not they are versed in tax and legal issues, which I consider to be the backbone of sound financial planning. Anyone can throw a buzzword , but would something like a Roth or TERM policy fit within your overall scheme?     Orman has a personality and it comes across in her writing -- but take her advice with a grain of salt.	2005-06-11

So what is a disruptive technology? Remember what Walmart did to Sears? Of course you do, because disruptive technologies are usually products or services that are faster, cheaper, smaller, and more convinient. Ultimately, good companies must refrain from doing what got them to the top in the first place--listening to their customers and believing everything comes down to superior technology--in order to successfully compete with the onslaught of start-ups redefining both the buying hierarchies and value networks in which they are implicated. <br /> <br />This is without a doubt one of the best business books I have ever read.	2004-10-05

In thier attempt to de-phallicize language and experience, the three poets Claridge brings under her purview enigmatically reinscribe its structures. Those failures, however, enable the poets to keep writing, penning away in search of a prelapsarian mode of apprehending exteriority, the landscape of course serving as interlocutor between it and interiority. (Pater, himself a belated Romantic, will aver at the end of the century that the difference between the two is merely putative). Within a Lacanian economy, the worth of words is simply that we are worst off for having them, but Nietzsche already knew this when he said that languge marks the weight of something already dead within us.<br />A solid contribtuion to a growing field of study, and thus recommended.	2003-03-17

In a remarkable and original intertextual study, Martin Harries brings Shakespeare and modern economic analysis under his purview to argue that the hunter is forever haunted by the hunted and that any attempt to disavow the supernatural will inevitably also welcome it to the party. Highly recommended.	2003-03-15

Even more, the novel illustrates that the protocols assigned to us by Walter Benjamin (fragments; allegory) and Freud (the uncanny; contours of trauma) still make perfect sense. Highly recommended.	2003-03-13

The work is--with regards to scholarship--deeply impoverished. Venerable writings on Hip Hop remain few--consult  Robin Kelly's or Tricia Rose's forays on the subject for  more engaged, scholarly readings.	2003-03-10

As bad as one wants to call Harold bombastic, Genius is a much-needed book in the Age of the Screen. Tendentious Bloom is, but then again, most geniuses are. Bloomian poetics is regretably on the wane while the monomaniacal social engineering machines that call themselves English deparments slowly forge thier empire, for better or worse. My own experience has proven that even bringing up Bloom's name during graduate courses makes professors anxious--his puissance is that spectacular. Bloom's bonafide readers await his full-length studies on Hart Crane and his mentor, Freud. That is, if he ever chooses to write them...<br />Genius is highly recommended, as is his entire oeuvre, if only to serve as an example that books still and will always matter. And yet, Bloom's prognosis remains Nietzchean in its tenor and pessimism: \\"Another century of readers--and spirit itself will stink\\" (Thus Spake Zarathustra, 43). It behooves us to carry literature forward after Bloom is gone, for Paul Celan has already warned us that the poem--and by extension,the act of literature itself--always demands and calls on the other. Genius is perhaps Bloom's last attempt to \\"ring us up,\\" as it were. The question is: Is anyone listening?	2003-01-03
