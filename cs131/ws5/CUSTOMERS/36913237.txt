Anyone who has been to France will express their astonishment at how thin French women are. I know I did. But the French, and Europeans generally, live where they work. They can walk on a lovely tree-lined street to purchase their groceries from independant merchants. Every few feet is a cafe.  Compare this to the urban sprawl in which so many Americans exist, where shopping is done in big-box strip-malls, where meals are eaten in the car out of a fast-food bag. It's an inhumane way to live which is why we turn to food for comfort.   The further one goes from a city centre, the fatter people are! New Yorkers are thinner than folks living in Texas. Why? Because they walk everywhere.    This book is wake-up call that has less to do with eating, and more to do with urban planning. The suburban life, where going to a gym becomes a necessity, is the real problem. I'm not sure that the author, who maintains residences in both Paris and New York, fully comprehends how suburban sprawl is directly related to how fat people have become. Not sure what her suggestions would be.	2005-05-18

But the book is so much better - infact, I question some of the decisions made when the screenplay was written. The protagonist in the film is depressed, unattractive, and spends most of the movie in a sullen funk. In the book, we glean that he is a pretty good looking guy, hilarious, and morose in an endearing sort of way. I laughed out loud - highly entertaining read, and much more occurs on the wine-tasting odyssey than the film allows for.  <br />If you like this book, you will absolutely love \\"St.Urbain's Horseman\\" by Mordecai Richler.	2005-05-13

If someone were to tell me that they read this book and didn't like it, I would know instantly that we have nothing in common. <br /> <br />There are parts to this story that cause tears to spring to my eyes, other parts where I laugh out loud. A little boy becomes a man and the events of his life are riveting. There comes a point where he is broke - not a penny to his name. This is, to me, one the most heartwrenching things I've ever read. His description of what is means to have no money, to be standing with your nose pressed against the window of life where you cannot participate, is scorching, poignant, and so true that you stare wide-eyed at the page. I felt like I knew this person. There is a special place in my heart for Somerset Maugham.	2005-04-30

Being Irish, I have long been interested in the Great Famine which destroyed a third of Ireland's population. This book is unlike anything I have ever come across: these essays insist that the famine cannot be studied as an isolated historical event, such as the Great Depression, or a war. Rather, the famine is seen as the end of a civilization, of an entire culture. A better anaology would be to compare it to the destruction of the Aztecs; what once existed was gone forever and to be replaced by a new order. Pre-famine Irish were gaelic speaking peasants who enjoyed an oral culture. There is almost nothing left of these people - the Irish museums have no artifacts, no written accounts. Nothing survived of these people, and what we do know about the famine comes largely from the observations of dispassionate English politicians.  <br /> <br />This books examines how the famine has become deeply woven into the Irish psyche; how it has become a part of the Irish collective consciousness and has shaped all that has transpired since. This is truly a novel approach, and one that I found to be very compelling. This is a book to be owned.	2005-03-02

We bring kids into this world and adult life with all its inherent joys and freedoms are suddenly ended.

Both authors were deeply affected, and sympathetic to, the plight of the working class, particularly the colliers. Unlike Lawrence, Zola appears to have actually spent some time either working in, or studying, the actual physical experience of being underground. His descriptions of these excursions into the \\"earth's belly\\" are so affecting, that you actually begin to feel clausterphobic.<br /><br />I've never read anything so descriptive to actually cause a physical sensation of pure repulsion.<br /><br />This is an excellent story about the dismal, grinding poverty of the working class in 18th century France, where the miners had<br /><br />seemingly no options, no political support, no social safety-net or regulatory body established for any sort of protection against exploitation. The sheer inhumanity of their situation is appalling - this is an excellent read, and intertwined is a love story that is equally compelling. I highly recommend this classic.	2005-01-10

These true stories make you laugh, think, and cry all at once.   This book does not feature a collection of miserable, whiny women naval gazing about how haaaaard motherhood is (like A [...] in the House); rather these are heartful, intelligent essays written by women who have experienced such love for their kids that you read with tears in your eyes.

She writes in a way that is intimate, comforting, and surprisingly informative: she is not interested in encouraging people to adopt design ideas simply for their popularity. Rather, she expresses strongly held convictions that  design and decorating are tools by which one can create an environment that is deeply personal and reflective of one's individual tastes. <br /> <br />Reading this book made me aware of many decisions I have made about decorating that have been influenced by designers who are more concerned with being \\"edgy\\" or \\"correct\\" than what is genuinely pleasing to the homeowner. I have often imagined what other people will think upon entering my home and this is wrong. Your home has to be satisfying to you: for example, a black & white print may be \\"correct\\" in a particular scenario and many of us succumb to what the designers dictate which has something to do with a vague notion of \\"taste\\". Ultimately, if you don't like black & white prints, if they leave you cold, what would be the point in hanging one on your wall? Just to impress people, to show people that you have your finger on the pulse of what's \\"in\\" ?  <br />Lynette Jennings is bold in her colour choices, uses big pieces in small rooms, and basically breaks so many \\"rules\\" that many of us have come to accept as givens.

Nothing in our culture, media, or general perception of life, tells us anything positive about aging so it's no wonder that everyone is running out to get Botox or sinking into mid-life depression. <br /> <br />I read this book to help out a male friend in crisis, and ended up helping myself. As a woman, I have come to view aging as form of death-sentence. I search my face to see if I have any wrinkles and often long to be 22 again. This book gives an accurate and scathing critique of the culture in which we live where aging has become a \\"disease\\" or something to be battled. I learned that fear of aging is a form of self-hatred; after all, what is the alternative to growing older? Dying young! This youth-obssessed society has made a whole segment of our population feel disenfranchised, ignored, and repulsive. It is shameful. If you're freaked out about getting on, read this book.	2004-10-15

Does Sarah Susanka really believe that a photograph which measures 1.5&quot; x 1.5&quot; is useful? I am a young person with 20/20 vision, and could not focus on these pictures. Susanka explains good design in a way that is original and refreshing; when a room looks good, she tells you why - and this is deeply informative. But the art of design is VISUAL, end of story. A blind person does not care if the alcove has wainscoting! Why then, would a designer of her calibre allow puny, useless, annoying photos in a book that costs $35.US??<br />All throughout, there they are: tiny little pictures that would have been stunning examples of well-placed design ideas, but instead serve to leave the reader frustrated and disappointed. <BR>For example, under the heading &quot;Art Glass Focus&quot; is a picture of a remarkable stained-glass window panel. But the photo measures 2.25 x 3 inches. There is no context in a picture this small! <br />If you aren't bothered by pictures so small that you need a magnifying glass, then by all means buy the book. If you only care about interesting text - buy the book.

This essay is entitled, &quot;One Day in Jozefow&quot; and it held me spellbound. It details what occured on July 13, 1942, a day of executions under the command of Major Wilhelm Trapp. He gave orders to murder women and children with tears in his eyes and was later seen &quot;weeping like a child&quot;. <br />His subordinates held him in contempt, especially since he was never seen at the shooting sites. He is quoted as saying, &quot;If this Jewish business is ever avenged on earth, then have mercy on us Germans&quot;. There were sergeants who also requested to be excused from the firing squads, as the idea of slaughtering human beings proved too horrendous to carry out. The Germans who carried out the executions were given alcohol to help with their agitation. It was decided &quot;intolerable&quot; to carry out the slaughter while sober. Some ran into the forest to vomit, others were so wracked with nervousness, they misfired. At the end of the day, some 1500 Jews lay dead. <br />What is so compelling about this essay is that is explains how these German battalions were later able to round up Jews to the gas chambers with relative detachment; there was so much less participation or responsibility (compared to shooting)and the men had become desensitized. In fact, historians have shown that the camps were constructed largely to spare the German executioners the trauma of face-to-face murder.<br />What is fascinating is this: it has been long believed that Germans who refused to carry out executions feared for their own lives. Not necessarily true. When Major Trapp let his aversion to the killings be known he was relocated and later promoted. In the case of Jozefow, the men had the opportunity to withdraw from shooting. Why didn't they refuse? Because they didnot want to seem cowardly and they wanted to be promoted. The ones who refused generally had businesses back home to rely on and didn't care about being promoted. And some did business with Jews, so their animosities were not inflamed.<BR>This essay is riveting. I give this book 3 stars because the other readings are so dry, so long-winded, and so devoid of emotion, that you find yourself reading the same sentence five times. History MUST be exciting to read - otherwise, no one reads it, which is a dangerous thing indeed.	2004-04-29

I have children of my own, and reading this book made me almost ill with sadness and horror. The heartache and misery endured by the Jewish people is beyond comprehension - it utterly boggles the mind.<br />First-person narrative history is perhaps the most interesting history to read; the individual accounts are so emotional that you want to reach into the page and lend comfort.

This book, however, seems to have been put together very quickly in order to sell copies.<br />Most annoying, are pictures that are too small - there is nothing worse than squinting at a picture, or worse, being tempted to take out a magnifying glass. This is especially irksome when there is a giant blank spot of empty page right above and beside it.<BR>The larger pictures are lovely, but editorial decisions are questionable when so much page is left blank. For instance, some of the photos are smaller than your average photograph.<br />Finally, there is something disturbing about declaring a house a &quot;family home&quot; based mostly, it seems, on size. These are homes which contain media rooms, arts &amp; crafts rooms, built-in storage designed from solid wood which would break anybody's budget.<BR>This book definitely advocates size over practicality; there seems little hope for the family living a home that isn't the size of a football field.	2004-03-23

This book is undoubtedly one of the worst I have encountered.<br />The back cover is infuriating in its suggestion of providing a &quot;fresh take&quot; on the Titanic story. Worse, is the assertion that Stephen Cox refutes the &quot;popular myth&quot; (whatever that is) and shows that the &quot;true story is more interesting...and much more disturbing&quot;. Talk about literary spin! There isn't anything new in this book, infact most of it - the first person accounts -are transcribed word for word as they are in other books.<br />Stephen Cox reads like a smug, know-it-all academic who sits in the safety of his ivory tower and waxes philosophic, dismissing a myriad of perspectives on the Titanic story as being without any value. Instead, he chooses to reduce the real-life persons involved to mere &quot;characters&quot; and likens the moment of the ship's sinking to be somehow a stage-set loaded with actors and actresses:<br />&quot;These were all superb performances, whether they were meant to assist others or only, at last, to assert the actors' sense of themselves. Were they only performances? Perhaps. But if so, the roles selected were appropriate to a moral drama...&quot;<br />Stephen Cox is a pedantic and condescending professor of literature; he is not a historian and this is blatantly obvious throughout. His supposed revolutionary ideas about the disaster come to very little, ie: even if there had been enough life boats, maybe they wouldn't have been utilized anyway given the situation. Maybe the captain of the Californian was a good guy after all...maybe &quot;women and children first&quot; is not a natural decision but rather a contrived moral position, blah blah blah.<br />It all amounts to boring speculation that at times reads like the musings of bloated professional student. At times his writing style is bewilidering:<BR>&quot;This, it appears, was their difference from Captain Lord, who took account of every risk except the risk of being the kind of person who cares only about the risks.&quot;<br />Enough said. This books stinks, and it's offensive to real historians; he speaks so scornfully about many of the witnesses and their recollections, that it reeks of insensitivity and self-righteousness.	2004-03-17

But when it comes to small spaces, it seems any home will do even if it's 3000 square feet. &quot;Small spaces&quot; is obvious a relative concept, depending on what you're used to. To me, a small space is any home which has a decided lack of closets, or storage areas. Bedrooms are small and difficult to make functional; children have no basement to play in, the kitchen has a puny eating area, etc. There wasn't a single picture in this book which impressed or inspired me.<br />To show readers pictures of homes which appear large, airy, and identical to any home found in any design magazine, is just not useful at all. I highly recommend Taunton Press' Storage Idea Book - it is inspirational and jam packed with great visuals.	2004-03-04

And his wife didn't even have an affair - she had a one-night stand consisting of oral sex.<BR>What this author doesn't know about men is a lot: her male character is essentially a woman named David.

The rest is so trivial that it defies belief. One cannot help but wonder how a person can live such a shallow, superficial life without committing suicide out of sheer boredom.<BR> <BR>  Jacquie's entire existence was a seemingly endless round of shopping, cocktail parties, and lavish holidays. She comes across as thoroughly despicable, as a person totally consumed by acquiring every petty object she lays eyes on. It makes for very DULL reading - you keep waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever does because her life was meaningless.<br />   What is most outrageous, is this enduring myth that she was a great mother, devoted to her son and daughter. Infact, she shipped them off to boarding school at heartbreakingly young ages, spending what amounts to a few months out of an entire year with either of them. How she has managed to maintain this aura of respect and awe is beyond me - all she ever did was shop and take vacations. Despite her millions, she was decidedly ungenerous, contributed almost nothing to any worthy cause, and lived a self-centered, self-absorbed life. <br />   If JFK hadn't been killed, she would have gone done in history like any other rich, country-club wife of a former president. This is hands-down the most boring biography I've ever read.	2004-02-05

The pictures in this collection seem to have been taken in one home - almost all the walls are an antiseptic green, or shabby white. The problem is this: placing an andirondack chair with the paint peeling off beside a rusty steel fan may look really hip if you live in a home which features heavy crown moulding, huge floor to ceiling windows, and pine plank floors. Try this ensemble in a dreary, typical living room with builder-grade carpet and aluminum windows. Your house will look like crap.<br />People look at these pictures and they may feel inspired, or visually pleased, without really understanding why. What they are taken by is the room itself, as an example of good design,  NOT what's in it - which is what the authors are focusing on in an attempt to recommend an authentic style. A traditional home with 5-inch baseboards and gorgeous built-ins on either side of a great looking fireplace looks beautiful EMPTY. What you put in it is almost irrelevent. THAT is what good design is: When a room looks great before you install a single stick of furniture.<br />Also, who needs a close-up of a wilted weed draped over a milk bottle? Or a roll of white toilet paper sitting in a wire mesh basket? Give me a break. You can find pictures like this in store catalogues. And how long could anyone tolerate working at a wobbly desk where the wood is badly blistered and peeling? How do you CLEAN something like this? Answer: you can't, because it's old and worn - not to be confused with an antique, which has enduring style and function.<br />If you like to follow fads like the &quot;shabby chic&quot; look, and wish to fill your home with flea market finds, make damn sure you have the right house, the right room, classic architecture, thick mouldings, french doors, hardwood floors, and 12-foot ceilings. Otherwise, you'll have to buy yourself a good miter-saw or hire a finishing carpenter to give your home the &quot;bones&quot; it needs to make this crappy stuff look like something.	2004-02-01
US	36913237	R2SUMCOP9DC3W6	0670828378	576289106	A Natural Curiosity	Books	2	7	12	N	N	Too Many Characters	This is the sequel to Drabble's &quot;The Radiant Way&quot; and is quite a disappointment. There are simply too many characters to keep track of, many of whom are completely unnecessary to the story line. The most interesting character, Shirley, is not fully explored. Instead, the author details seemingly pointless escapades of characters who were briefly introduced in the first chapter, not to be mentioned again until the end. It is baffling.<br />Also, many times she speaks directly to the reader, eg: &quot;Now, I guess you're wondering what happens to so-and-so...&quot; It's very irritating. I finished the book because Margaret Drabble is a fine writer. Unfortunately, every time I picked up the book, I had to re-read the previous half chapter to remember what was going on. Ultimately, this is a story that you will immediately forget upon completion.	2004-01-29

The real question is why our governments are allowing these companies to poison us. It's truly depressing.	2004-01-16

It occured to me that Ms.Daum was writing a story that would be easily transfered to the screen - I think she's trying to cash in on the Bridget Jones's Diary phenomena. I say this because there are scenes in the story that are ridiculous, completely unnecessary to the plot, and simply reeking of pandering to a potential director. It often reads like a screenplay. <BR>The worst part of this book is the writing. Where was the editor? Every lesbian character wears Birkenstocks and stands around talking about soy. Every single character in this story is a stereotype - to the extent that they cease to be believable in any sense. Everytime she turns on the radio a Peter Frampton song is playing. We get it: this is the midwest where classic rock reigns. Oddly enough, in this one little town, there are more socially conscious, politically active, intelligent individuals than would every be possible. It boggles the imagination, yet somehow these characters are written with a definite disdain - as if we're supposed to be laughing at them. The only character worthy of disdain and contempt is the protagonist, Lucinda Trout. (Trout? City girl moves to country = a fish out of water? What amazing symbolism)<br />Additionally, the story itself is totally unbelievable - a woman moves to the midwest and everything just falls into place. She's left New York for financial reasons, but seems to have money galore - even though her salary has been halved by her employer. She even manages to rent a house, support a man (and assumingly his kids)shop at Restoration Hardware (a super expensive store) and Pottery Barn, etc. It's absurd.  <BR>Don't waste your time. If you want to read this, check it out of the library, like I did.	2003-11-03

The photographs show portions of rooms that are simply too miniscule to appreciate; the context in which they are situated is not displayed. I found myself frowning a lot and feeling somewhat baffled.<BR>Also, I question the relevence of including close-ups of flowers, or fruit, or a long blank wall with a tiny window at the end of it. It's very irritating. Also, most of these homes are apartments which feature ultra-contemporary furnishings - cupboards with no knobs, couches that look like surf boards, etc. Only a few of the homes could be described as cozy and inviting and they were the best pictures, in my opinion.<BR>Ultimately, the smallness of the pictures ruined it for me - I hate having to squint at a photo. A better book is the New Decorating Book (2002, I believe) by Better Homes &amp; Gardens. A true feast for the eyes.	2003-10-23

This is why I generally read 19th century fiction....but along comes Meghan Daum and what a refreshing discovery. She is an excellent writer - clear, direct, authoritative, and very funny. It's strange in a way, to be reading about my own generation from one of its members. Her recollections of the 80's made me laugh out loud. And the essay about carpet was brilliant - I felt as though it had been written about me. She puts into words so many ideas, thoughts, and feeling that I have had but could never properly articulate. It seems that the Generation X'ers are finally getting a chance on the stage. I hope she writes about the insufferable arrogance of the baby-boomers.	2003-10-23

My favourite is &quot;Christmas Time is Here&quot; - the chords are full and very jazzy, and it's easy to add another note if you want to make is sound even better. Unfortunately, the fabulous Guaraldi solos are not included - these you will have to figure out yourself. &quot;Skating&quot; is fun to play - my kids love it - but I was so disappointed that Guaraldi's sizzling solo was absent. Still, I highly recommend this book - assuming it's the one I have and not a cheesier version - it's a holiday classic.	2003-10-06

Like most books of this genre, it is candy for the eye - you may be inspired, but to go out and use the same colours as in the book is foolish.<BR>The homes featured in this book are mostly country, or traditional. Any paint colour you choose is dramatically influenced by the architecture of your home, the climate in which you live, whether it faces north or south, etc. The homes in this book seem to exist in isolation on snowy plains or country acreage unobstructed by neighbours, power-lines, garages, etc. She does not talk about size at all. For example:  a tall skinny home, with little architectural detail, painted fire engine red will not look nearly as charming as a cosy cottage with heavy moldings and shutters. There is little mention of accent, or trim colours. It is a flimsy read - if you love the idea of a yellow home (as I do) you will only find ONE yellow house. There is only ONE red house. A better book would have shown pictures of 4 or 5 homes, in different styles, painted red, yellow, blue, etc. We're talking about photographs here - why not include more? A better option for house paint ideas is to drive around your neighbourhood, which shares the same light, climate, etc. as your own. Find a few houses you really like, then ask the owners what colour they used.	2003-09-24

It has some good old-fashioned information but given the size of this book (big enough to kill someone if dropped on the head) it's disappointing. The muffin recipes have way too much sugar for the amount of flour required, the cookie recipes are not good, and if you're Italian, you will have a good laugh at the pasta recipes.	2003-09-23

Suffice it to say, I like the way Rachel Cusk writes. This book, however, was a stinker. The problem with Cusk is that she forces the reader to be made more aware of the writing than of the story itself. I would find myself re-reading entire paragraphs because my mind had wandered off. I am used to reading &quot;capital L&quot; literature - Lawrence, Hardy, etc., so this isn't a question of incomprehension or preference for simple writing. Rather, it's about being confronted by the messenger as opposed to the message; you never quite sink into &quot;story dreamland&quot; because of the stilted, infuriating writing. <br />This story is stupid and bewildering mostly because the main character is thoroughly unlikeable. She is defensive, self-absorbed, and emotionally immature. Her friendship with Nina (her flatmate) is so fraught with mutual animosity and mean-spiritedness, that it was difficult to read; depressing, in fact.<BR>This was Cusk's first novel and I'm glad I read it last as she has definitely improved. However, she still features women who are somehow cold and when you finish reading, you completely forget about them. It doesn't warm you through - there are no regrets when the last page is turned. <BR>Cusk needs to focus on telling really good stories instead of trying to impress the reader (or critic)with her long-winded sentences and big words where a smaller one would have had much more impact.	2003-09-15

Rachel Cusk is a fantastic writer and her descriptions of motherhood are absolutely genuine. This is not a depressing book at all - it is hilarious and heartfelt and, in the end, Cusk does articulate the temporary nature of the worst of it...the first year or so of a baby's life. I've read many books on motherhood, hoping to see myself on the pages. This was it. Thank you, Rachel Cusk.	2003-08-26

Likewise, I'll always remember the day when I learned that Mordecai Richler had died. I was standing in the kitchen, making dinner, when it was announced on the CBC. I fell apart, and it's the only time I have ever cried over someone I didn't even know.<BR>When people tell me that they've never heard of, or read, Mordecai Richler, I want to rail at the universe. He's simply the best there is - a novelist who was intelligent, comical, introspective, cynical, perceptive, heartfelt, brutally honest, and ultimately, unforgettable. Reading St.Urbain's Horseman saved me from a dismal semester in university. I was taking existentialist philosophy and sinking into gloom when I escaped into a story that was impossible to put down. I laughed out loud - so hard that I couldn't read. I could go on all day. Just read this book - I guarantee that you'll read it again. And then you'll have to read everything else Mordecai Richler wrote.<BR>I wish there were more stories to look forward to.	2003-08-26

It is utterly riveting, thought-provoking, and incites the most passionate discussions.

Please! The characters in this collection inspire a certain curiosity but are hardly &quot;unforgettable&quot;. The story &quot;The Palace Thief&quot; would have been much more enjoyable had I not read the quintessential teacher/student story which is &quot;Of This Time, Of That Place&quot; by Lionel Trilling - hands down the best short story I've ever read. I wonder if Ethan Canin has read this because there is a similiarity. But where Trilling's story is a classic, Canin's is merely average.<BR>Also, the first-person narratives in two of the stories (the first &amp; last) sound like the same person - both are pedantic, somewhat pompous, and long-winded.<BR>I'm beginning to worry that the reading public has become immune to terrible writing, which is why when someone like Canin comes along, there's an overflow of enthusiasm which is just not warranted. These are good little stories, but all are easily forgettable. This is easy-reading, and the neither the stories nor the writing, are particularly memorable.	2003-04-28

I would read the sentence again and again, feeling a mixture of awe and complete despair that I'll never write as well.<BR>This book kept me riveted, not so much by the plot, as by the writing itself. It is writing for readers who love words and the way they can fit together to express something that is so familiar and yet never properly articulated. Rachel Cusk has an astonishing talent and she's only 36. She has a great future ahead of her.<BR>The story is about a young lonely woman, and a young lonely man, who are somehow thrown together in a world that is disorienting, and alienating. At times it is painful, other times it is so funny that you cannot help laughing out loud. The main characters, Francine and Ralph, are a match made in hell. She is vain and petty and superficial. He has resigned himself to a life of familiarity. Their relationship is fascinating and depressing and often hilarious all at once. You feel genuine compassion for these two; neither is bad nor good. And you want a happy ending for them both because they are suffering. <BR>Unfortunately, the ending bothered me and left me uneasy. But it's a good story and it is written in language that requires a certain amount of penetration; it is not a book that you read with the stereo on. I highly recommend it and will add Rachel Cusk to my list of admired writers.	2003-04-16
