As the title suggest the book describes the top ten Greek legends but each one is written in a different style, from an angry letter to Zeus, a play, a newspaper article or a police report in the case of Oedipus and I think this makes the book even more interesting. It also has top ten facts in between each legend from a list of the most powerful gods to a list of mythological criminals and their punishments.  <br /> <br />As it is written in the same style as the horrible histories (and by the same author) it is light and easy as well as funny (if slightly cheesy) and goes into another depth to interest and entertain the reader without boring them.  <br /> <br />If you're attracted to Greek mythology but don't want to go into too much depth I think you'll like this, i certainly do!  <br />	2005-09-12

It's great that she's a bit flawed and gets into messes because of her arrogance, and I even liked the storyline (though to be honest it's probably only because of \\"Clueless\\") to a certain extent - I just felt it was a little dull.  <br /> <br />Nothing ever really seemed to happen. People just talked. A lot. And I felt that the whole 367 pages (of my copy) could have been cut down to 150 - at least! The one possibly exciting part (Harriet and the gypsies) you didn't see happen, as it was only ever talked about. Like the rest of the book.  <br /> <br />It's the first Austen I've read and has - I hate to say - slightly put me off trying any of her others, although I probably will in time. <br /> <br />If you like charming books of light humour and romance - or just Austen - I'm sure you'll enjoy Emma, but if like me, you are used to a bit more excitement and adventure, you might want to try something else.  Sweet, but not much else.  <br />	2005-08-28

The romance is nice, but can be a little slushy and I'd imagine that fierce adventure fans (or people who don't like romance) would feel that these parts dragged the story down. <br /> <br />This book is also a lot darker than the previous and although I liked this it may be an idea for parents reading with their children to read it first so they can be prepared for some more difficult areas (such as inferi (zombies) and a werewolf that practically likes to attack kids, and of course the death aspect)  <br /> <br /> But despite its problems I did really like it and think that most Potter fans will feel the same.  <br /> <br />Bring on the next book! <br /> <br />	2005-07-21

I just found that I didn't really enjoy it and found it difficult to get into. <br /> <br />For me, the language was beautiful, in parts, but the pretty metaphors, similes and adjectives got in the way of the story and at times I felt I was lost in the description and was desperately trying to find an interesting storyline. <br /> <br />The storyline was interesting but I don't think it needed to be so long and there wasn't really enough to keep me interested or encouraged me to wade through the description to find it. At points I felt the author used so much description to thicken up the storyline which was lacking.  <br /> <br />The characters also didn't come across as very developed. None of them seemed to really have any flaws (apart from Corbett's grandfather) and I think this made them seem very two dimensional and distant, even the narrator, and I didn't find myself caring about any of them.  <br /> <br />I'm a fan of fantasy but I think this particular story is a bit too mysterious for me, and I'm still not sure what happened in some points, this wasn't due to my lack of reading abilities but rather a lack of interest in what happened. It just didn't have me hooked.   <br /> <br />I've not read any other of McKillip's books and I'd like to because I've read that this isn't her best so if you're a fan of her writing style I'd give it ago. But if your like me, and prefer a really strong story to very pretty writing you might want to give it a miss. <br />	2005-06-16
US	25068224	R2QRSLRSQ4KB8F	0375813748	184815754	Milkweed	Books	5	18	21	N	N	really excellent!	I don't really read holocaust books because they are just too sad, but I decided to give this one ago because of the great reviews I'd heard. <br /> <br />It's about a young boy who doesn't know his own age and assumes that his name is \\"Stopthief\\". You follow him as he tells the story of the Holocaust through his own innocent eyes and you see the changes that he and the people he love go through. The majority of the book is not set in the concentration camps, but in the ghetto and the time before that, as the persecution began.  <br /> <br />It is written in a very simple style which gives a voice to Misha (previously \\"Stopthief\\") as he realizes and doesn't realize what is happening around him.  <br /> <br />The simple style means that horrible events can happen mostly without sentiment but very clearly and matter of factly. Misha himself is not particularly upset by dead bodies being slung onto carts, although the reader might be, but because of Misha's voice and the short chapters your attention is pulled elsewhere before the meaning really has a chance to sink in. I think this really helped show the innocence of the young boy and also make the book a lot easier to read and to take.  I wouldn't recommend it to children much under 11 though because some parts, such as a man who particularly likes suffocating kids, are a bit gruesome and nasty for younger readers.  <br /> <br />Although I really didn't expect to actually enjoy a book about the Holocaust, Milkweed is completely compelling and is worth reading just for the loving little boy with a changeable name who can't keep still.  <br /> <br />It maybe sad in parts but I think it's worth it. <br />	2005-05-29

I'm not going to bore you with the story line as you've probably heard it a million times already.    Harry has got annoying. He's now supposed to be a \\"stroppy teenager\\" which is fair enough, he is at that age; however ALL he seems to do is whine and shout at his friends! Grow up Harry!     I liked the idea that he has started to date now, because he is at that age and things, however I got very bored with all the Cho drama very quickly! You'd think one of them would have the sense to say \\"This isn't working; I'm unhappy, move on with the plot!\\"    We are introduced to some new characters such as Umbridge and although I liked her in theory (it was nice having someone really evil that wasn't a death eater- though lets face it, they don't really seem all that evil!) there was far too much about her and her dictatorship of Hogwarts.    This big secret that we are supposed to find out in book 5 is NO BIG SECRET. Its stuff that anyone who has read the books would have concluded AGES ago. (Apart form the Neville part) I could have said the prophecy myself at the end of book 4.     I'm still not very impressed with Voledemort, I'm just waiting for something to show that he is a REALLY evil person.     In my opinion this is by far the worst Harry Potter book. Its long and I don't think it needs to be. When I re-read the first and second books after this one, there was so much more going on! And they weren't a third of the size! I'm quite a quick reader and long books don't bother me, but the Harry Potter series is supposed to be written for children and I think J K Rowling has forgotten this, perhaps with all the hype about adults liking her books she has thought about them as her audience instead, but part of the Harry Potter charm is that its not written for adults.    However, the idea was that the children would grow up as Harry does, year by year, the main target audience around his age, and with this in mind I don't think the content, such as his dating (lets face it, he's 15, they kissed THAT'S ALL) or the use of illegal curses or death; should be criticized, as some reviewers have done. She could have put in a lot worse!    It has some good points (I liked St. Mungo's, and I love Lupin and Snape!) but I think that this shows that J K Rowling might not be such as good writer as people originally thought.    If you love Harry Potter read it, if you're thinking of trying the series please don't judge it on this book! If you are thinking of reading it to particularly young children you might want to wait a year or two.    I await the 6th book, and I seriously hope that J K Rowling hasn't lost her ability completely!   (i gave the book 3 stars simply because its part of the series and i haven't competely given up hope!)	2005-04-12

Especially as this is something she is determined to hide.  <br /> <br />I loved the way it was told in first person as you feel that you are really growing along with Jack, especially as her language and dialect improves and changes throughout. <br /> <br />With lovely relationships, exciting pirate adventures, a near rape, and a charming heroine this page-turner is well worth it!  <br />	2005-02-28

I liked the way that Robin is no perfect guy and claims to be the worse archer in his band of merry men and women, I always prefer flawed heroes. I also like the way that there is no glamorising the outlaws life and you see that they are cold and hungry and paranoid about discovery.  <br /> <br />I thought the romance in the story is very well done. It takes quite a back seat, letting the story carry on but still manages to be satisfying. (Personally I preferred Little John's and Cecily/Cecil relationship rather than Robin's and Marion's, which could have been a little more developed.) <br /> <br />Although there was a lot that I loved about the book I felt there could have been more. I would have liked for McKinley to have taken the time to go into a little more depth with some of the characters and I would have certainly liked to have know more about the sheriff of Nottingham, I also felt that the middle of the book lacked some incidents and was a little slow, I would have liked a bit more action there I think. However the climax of the story is fantastic and in my opinion, worth the wait.  <br /> <br />If you don't mind books that can be a little slow in the beginning, and you like tales of Robin Hood, then I think you'll enjoy this book. All I can say is that I didn't want it to end. <br />	2005-01-09

The three heroes meet some interesting and original characters, such as the Ombaraka, the old children, the mud people and the Zars.<br /><br />I found the old children (who drain your strength and your life when they touch you) extremely creepy and what could possibly be more sinister than an army of children who do so love to kill??!!!??<br /><br />I was also a little disappointed at the lack of depth of the characters, although they are still very likable and are also very vivid and you learn a lot more about them in the later books.<br /><br />I really liked the way the \\"oaths\\" were simply made up words, such as \\"pongo\\" because the characters could swear and curse with feeling without offending the reader.<br /><br />I liked the Wind Singer a lot because I thought it was very different and refreshing as well as being exciting and interesting.<br /><br />I would recommend it to fantasy lovers of about 10 up, although older readers will probably be looking for something more, the next two books go into much more depth when the characters have become older and I think they'll find what they're looking for in the sequels.	2004-12-22

Although I expected the short chapters to be tiring after a while I found they kept the book moving and the suspense always at a high, right until the end.  <br /> <br />The writing style is simple but elegant and sets the mood for the dark story, however the book is not actually that heavy going or depressing, despite the nature of the storyline. <br /> <br />A refreshing and interesting dark tale full of suspense and melodrama.

We also meet Kitty who is currently an active part of the Resistance who by using petty thefts and small acts of violence are trying to overthrow the magicians and stop the class-based society they live in.  <br /> <br />This book is gloomier than the first. Nathaniel is depressed or stressed 99% of the time, and so is Kitty. She is a wonderful and vivid character; it's just unfortunate that Nathaniel is dismal too, because I think you just feel it too much. <br /> <br />It is, of course, broken up by the delightful and witty Bartimaeus that we have all come to love. However, he doesn't appear as much as in the first book and you do notice his absence a lot more. <br /> <br />I also thought the climax wasn't quite as good as in the Amulet of Samarkand. It was still very absorbing, just wasn't as climatic as the first. <br /> <br />Despite all this the book is enjoyable, interesting, laugh out loud funny at times (when Bartimaeus is around) and a must read for just about anyone.

True Believer is the story of 15 year old La Vaughn as she struggles to grow up in her dangerous community, all the time aiming for better things, until she gets a little side tracked by meeting Jody who she believes to be in love with. She begins to ask herself all sorts of questions about herself and the people around her. <br /> <br />The book is written in a series of broken sentences giving the illusion of a poem. For example: <br /> <br />\\"There was another shooting at school today. <br />We hadn't had one since last year. Sirens, <br />ambulance, fear in everybody's eyes, even the surly ones <br />trying to look unafraid. I was late to one class <br />running around making sure Jody was still alive. <br />The teacher didn't notice me, <br />there was too much chaos and hubbub <br />for hours. <br />Our school doesn't close every time gun goes off <br />the way good schools do, <br />but it takes a long time for everybody's heart to slow down.\\"   <br /> <br />The whole book is written as so and to start with it annoyed me slightly and I thought it was a desperate attempt from the author to make her story appear different and interesting. However, after the first few pages I got into the writing style and I think it really suited the story and it made things stand out more, making you take more notice of what La Vaughn was saying and thinking.  <br /> <br />I think the book deals with a lot of issues but isn't as heavy as it could be, which just makes it more of an enjoyable read. <br /> <br />I really didn't expect to like this book, I don't know why, I just didn't think I'd like it much but I ended up really enjoying it, I'll look for more of Virginia Euwer Wolff's work, including Make Lemonade, which is the first in the trilogy and something I haven't yet read (you don't need to to understand this sequel). <br /> <br />An interesting and original story about the difficulties of growing up in a difficult place, but still knowing that you can become all thatyou would become anywhere else.  I'd suggest it for teenagers who are thinking about the world around them. It really is very good!  <br />	2004-10-10

Then the blind Shahrazad steps forward and makes a plan to tell the king a story that will take many nights to tell, he will love it so much he'll keep her alive to hear the end. With stories in the story this is a book that keeps your attention until the last page. <br /> <br />It has a strong female lead that is well developed, interesting and certainly likeable. I think the rest of the characters also stand out, especially the king whose thoughts and feelings are portrayed as much as Shahrazad's.  <br /> <br />I have never known the story of the Arabian Nights and so I found this refreshing and different. I don't know how much like the original it is or if there are any aspects that Dokey developed more than other writers. <br /> <br />I would say that this is a book for aged 10 and above if only because some times the stories within stories can be slightly confusing, but I'm really not very good at suggesting ages. I preferred it to \\"beauty sleep\\" because I thought it was more interesting and I liked the ending better.

Shunned from birth and considered bad luck Adeline Yen Mah is forced to prove her worth to her father and step mother as well as her siblings, while over coming immense tragedies in her life. <br /> <br />It is the story of hope, courage and never ceasing determination to succeed. <br /> <br />It is told in a simple style (which fits as your seeing Adeline as a young girl) through out and has you feeling everything that Adeline feels, as she constantly struggles for the recognition she deserves from her father.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book and although it is very very sad Adeline charisma is enough to get you through with her. Although you may feel that every time something good happens to her, it gets taken away, she is able to make friends wherever she goes and finds comfort in her books and studies.  <br /> <br />If you want to read something a little different and interesting and don't mind gloomy stories, or you'd like to know a bit more about Chinese culture, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did!

This is a retelling of sleeping beauty (as you've probably heard before) but this retelling does so slightly differently. It focuses on what growing up with a curse hanging over you can be like, the fact Aurore has to stay away from the kitchen and ladylike tasks such as embroidery. It also shows how it must feel to have everyone knowing that they'll lose you in your 16th year, including your parents and subjects, and how this effects you as a heir to the throne.  <br /> <br />When the curse starts effecting the kingdom with messed up magic causing all sorts of twisted things to happen, Aurore runs away to where there are no people she can affect with the curse. It is in La Foret that she meets Prince Ironheart and.... I'll let you read the book.  <br /> <br />In this retelling you meet a charming, lively and likable heroine that you wish to succeed. <br /> <br />However, I felt the story was lacking something... it just felt a bit underdeveloped and is a very quick read. I think I would have enjoyed it more if some of the other characters stood out as much as Aurore (Ironheart actually is quite vivid as well) and if Dokey had gone into more depth with how Aurore felt knowing after 16 years she'd wake up a 100 years later! That seems like quite a big deal to me and although Dokey's explored it more than most I think she could have done so more.  <br /> <br />One more thing that bothered me.... the ending, I'm not going to give anything away but... it was just a bit... dodgy. The guy is really nice and it's good they end up together but I think Aurore should have known him some other way. (This won't make sense but read it and it might) <br /> <br />A bit predictable, a bit short and a little dodgy in the end, but apart from that it's a really good read! I don't think there is a particular age range that it wouldn't be suitable for but over 13's might be looking for something more... <br />	2004-09-12

Ok, it's a good book, it really is, but what was there for everyone else, it just wasn't there for me.<br /><br />I think the storyline and idea are completely wonderful and original, how Garth Nix managed to come up with such a story is beyond me.<br /><br />However, the writing may have been very good but to me the characters all seemed a bit two-dimensional. And I felt it was really grey. Not boring, just grey. It lacked that something that makes you fall in love with the world and the characters. The cat creature thing started off as my favourite until it tried to kill Sabriel, which was a good twist to the story and everything but really made me feel very differently about it.<br /><br /> I did like the romance side and I felt like it added another interest without getting in the way or becoming too gushy and sloppy.<br /><br />I'm someone who likes to get completely swept up in a book and wanted to read it because I care about the characters and what will happen to them. With Sabriel I felt I was reading it so I could finish it and start another book. I think I will read the others but I don't have high hopes.<br /><br />If you just want to read something fresh, different and interesting and don't mind dark stories, you should give this a go.<br /><br />Good luck.	2004-08-21
US	25068224	R13WOFEFWNLESJ	0399222499	524233807	Two Weeks with Queen	Books	5	4	4	N	N	very very sad.	I must have read TWO WEEKS WITH THE QUEEN about 6 years ago now (I was about 10) and where I might have forgotten details of the plot and the names of some of the characters it's still a book that I remember and love.  <br /> <br />It has a strong, charismatic and honest main character (Colin) that's little brother is currently dying of cancer. He is sent away to England, as his parents think it will be less stressful than watching his brother die. Colin resolves to find the Queen's own doctor and cure his little brother. On the way he meets a gay man who's lover is also dying. A strong friendship begins as they each face the worst.  <br /> <br />It's a story with relationships, love, death, prejudice, terminal diseases and hope. Told with humour and honesty through the eyes of a young boy just trying to save his brother.  <br /> <br />A must read for anyone.   <br />	2004-08-18

It was clear, simple and it seemed to me as if it was really clean, if that makes any sense. It was an easy, almost straight to the point story that kept me entertained. I think there were some deep metaphors that passed me by though. I liked most of the characters but would have liked it better if they were given some more depth.    However, I can see how some people would not like this book. Not alot really happens and I imagin (though I haven't seen it) that the film version is rather slow and boring. As I read it in a day I dont think I had time to get bored with it. The characters are not particluary memerable and some seem very flat at times. It's supposed to be a book about passion but I didn't feel much between any of the characters. Although Griet may have felt it for her master, until he left her the earrings at the end I don't think I felt anything at all from him though out the whole book, and as a result I didn't care about this character. I don't know anything about the real Vermeer so I have no idea if he acted anything like he did in the story.     Despite it's faults I did really enjoy this book and as long as your someone who can relex and read something that's not packed full of action I think you'll probably enjoy it too.	2004-07-11

I was forced to read it for my English coursework and I think I was the ONLY person in the class who read the whole thing, and I only did that so I could say how rubbish it was without people saying &quot;how can you say that without reading the whole thing??&quot; <br />The characters had no personality. None at all! Especially the women who seemed to be prizes or props that showed the men as acting with duty. (Susan and Elizabeth Jane: aka drip drip and drip drip jr.) The plot twists? What plot twists???? The flowery language and p a g e s of description had me banging my head on the desk in frustration. <br />Why o why did we have to read this book? Other classes got Frankenstein, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde or Sherlock Holmes. What did we get? Over 300 pages of boredom. <br />The only points I enjoyed in the slightest were that Lucetta was pregnant and that Henchard called E-J &quot;Izzy&quot;. The rest...  <br />I pity the people who think this book is a &quot;classic&quot;; you must have read some really awful books.	2004-06-04

The Nan is a binge eater; the mother is an extreme anorexic, and the daughter, Carmen (who narrates) has been shaped by her mother to believe thin is beauty, thin is success, thin is everything and after being swept off to Birmingham she starts to believe it might be true. <br />Personally I really enjoyed this book. I think it's different from anything else I've read about eating disorders and deals with it in a different way. The main focus is on the mother and how it has changed her completely but it also deals with how she can pass these insecurities onto her daughter. She is always calling her fat and forcing her on diets with her, when Carmen has absolutely nothing to worry about. <br />Something I wasn't sure about was the age of Carmen. I think she's supposed to be 14/15 but at the beginning of the book I think it paints her as younger, for example she doesn't wear a bra although she's supposed to have a large chest and be \\"meaty\\" (personally I DO NOT think 8 stone is \\"meaty\\") and her mother bushes her hair, nagging her to wear it in plaits. But her friend is nearly \\"doing it\\" and when she moves to the city she thrown into sex, drugs and rock and roll. <br />I think the book can be a little weird in places but I liked that, I thought it made it different. I liked the way you saw anorexia from both the person who deals with it and seeing someone you love deal with it perspectives. It's easy to read and a short one too. It might have made me feel a little guilty for eating so much to begin with but as you see just what the consequences can be for extreme dieting I was very glad at the end that I have a healthy attitude towards food.<br />If you've ever felt a bit dodgy about your apperence or weight, or know someone who sufferers from an eating disorder, you should read this!	2004-05-25
US	25068224	R1S0J9NWOTR3H4	0141306963	409397086	The Facts Speak for Themselves	Books	3	0	1	N	N	good, not great	For me, this book follows the title to the letter. It is told through the eyes of Linda, a sexually active 13 year old of low to average intelligence. She has been forced to grow up at an astounding rate due to the indifference of her mother, raising her brothers and taking care of one of her step fathers after he has a stoke. She is unaware that any of the molesting and emotional damage to her is abuse. <br />I grew fond of her as the story unfolded but I never loved her. I don't think she quite had the charisma I wanted although I think she certainly had the potential <br />It might have been because of the way the story was written. It seemed completely stripped of emotion, as the title suggests. But I think this would make it much easier for people to read who haven't come across the subjects before. For example, when she is raped there is very little description other than, \\"When he was inside me I didn't like it. I hit him. I said hurry up.\\"     <br />I did enjoy this book but I think it seemed a bit mugged in places. It also doesn't use speech marks, which I found extremely annoying and confusing to read. I couldn't say what age range this book should be for. Perhaps 13 +. Some of the things in it might disturb some people but I honestly think it is told in such away that people won't feel nearly as horrified than of something which is told in detail and with emotion.	2004-05-12

Every time i went into a bookshop or the libury i saw it and although the cover was eyecatching i read the back and thought it looked quite  boring. Then one day i thought \\"what the hell, i'll give it a try\\" i am sooo glad i did. This book is amazing.<br />It's about a 14 year old called John who has all a teenager's normal stuggles wile fighting his own battle with his abusive step father.<br />It's told in a unquie style and in 2nd person and it works beautifully. it seems a little muggled, especially at first but trust me and stick with it, after the first few pages your be hooked.<br />John has a very critical out look on life and is convinced things aren't what they seem (after all Glory Hallujah could be a goat, just in a disguse as a girl) which probably comes from his own home life being nothing like it seems.<br />It has serious issues and is at times, very sad and slightly graphic (although i've read a lot worst) but is extremly funny too. (Gloria eating his note! hee hee)<br />Seriously, i think this book is brilliant i really do, and i dont normally give ANYTHING  5 stars!	2004-02-28

I kinda thought that it deserved more than 3 and a half stars but when I read it there was definity something I couldn't put my finger on, that really really irritated me.<br />It's about a 16 year old faeire who doesn't know she's a faerie (Kaye) who, through no fault of her own, gets caught between a faerie war. It's got a bit of love but not much gushy stuff, (which I think is good!) <br />A review I just read said that it thought there was too much desription in it (the sun looking like he slit his wirsts in the bathtub). Personally i liked the description, and I think when your in faerie land and stuff, you need it because otherwise everyone would have completly different ideas of what Holly Black's faerie land looked like, other than just variations. Sometimes I did switch off a bit though.<br />I think this story is very dark and you should be prepared for that. If your someone who likes happy fairy tale endings I wouldn't recomend this book to you. Even I found it a bit depressing and I tend to have quite a gloomy outlook on the world anyway.<br />I'd say this was a book for teenagers, who want to see a view of faeries which shows them as having pointy teeth, sharp claws and pretty evil intentions. <br />It's great, you should read it!	2004-01-16
US	25068224	R2NQ91UZONIB4F	078681859X	506234393	The Amulet of Samarkand, Book 1 (Bartimaeus )	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Bring on the next book!!!	It's the story of this djinni, Bartimaeus, who gets summoned by a magician's apprentice, Nathaniel. On the search for revenge they get caught in a plot to destroy the magician government.<br /> When people describe this book, they always seem to start with Nathaniel. For me, it's ALL about the ironic, clever, slightly malicious djinni. Bartimaeus is written with such skill that i feel he could (i hate this cliche) jump right off the page. (i wish he would, i think he's great!) <br />I don't think Nathaniel is quite as vivid but he still makes an alarmingly strong character. I love the way he's not \\"good\\" in the sweet polite little boy sense of the word, and that in the end of the book you are left wondering if he'll be manipulated into turning \\"evil\\". <br />I think that Simon Lovelace lacks something. He makes a good baddy, just not a great one. And i like my villans proper nasty (i think Faquarl pulls this off wonderfully).<br />Some people have compared this to Harry Potter and although i didnt notice the simularities while reading it, i do now. The young magician (or wizard) both in their type of school. Magicians treating commoners (or muggles) as second class citizens. The big wizard trying to take over the world and only this boy can stop him. It all sounds a bit familiar. However, i don't think Bartimaeus comes in anywhere in Harry Potter, and he's what makes the book. So Jonathan Stroud gets my full apprecation. I couldn't honestly say whether i prefer Harry Potter or The Amulet but so far there are 5 Harry Potter books and only one Amulet of Samarkand. <br />All i can say is read it! In fact buy it! If you're anything like me, you'll love it!!!	2004-01-10
