I have to agree with the many other reviewers who found this story exciting, romantic and a can't-put-it-down read.

I had to wonder if it was possible to write a Cynster novel with a woman as the central character - after all, the Cynster men just about define the alpha/testosterone hero!!  But Stephanie Laurens has risen to the challenge and succeeded admirably with this book.<BR>Amanda and Amelia Cynster, twins and terrors, are now eligible, beautiful adults (well, physically anyway).  But they're bored with the current crop of potential husbands and decide to make their own lists.  Amanda finds her future mate, Lord Martin Dexter, in the dark underbelly of society.  I was a little puzzled by the freedom Amanda obviously enjoyed to visit such places, but the charm of the story and the delightful characters offset this minor plot glitch.<BR>Amanda is a Cynster, through and through, intelligent, independent and manipulative to her own ends.  Martin is the perfect foil - handsome, sensual, and controlling - sparks between these two are inevitable.<BR>As we have come to expect from this fine writer, the sex is hot, the plot exciting, and the strong sense of family permeates the book.  It's a delight for any historical romance fan - for Cynster-lovers, it's a must-read!!!	2002-04-07

You won't find a more sensual, attractive, droolingly wonderful bunch of guys anywhere else!  Each brother has his own strengths and weaknesses - and they're all fabulous in the ways that really matter!  Cole is a perfect oldest brother, mature in some ways, vulnerable in others.  Chase is the quiet one, reserved and a bit withdrawn until something special clobbers him hard!!! Mack is the charmer - warm, spontaneous and very loving!  Oh, and lest there be any doubt at all, they're all fantastically sensual!  This book is a delight - you'll smile, hold your breath, laugh, and wish these guys lived in your town!

After the lackluster \\"Dawn in Eclipse Bay\\", the bland \\"Lost and Found\\", and the frankly dismal \\"Slightly Shady\\", Jayne Ann Krentz seems to have finally found her pace again with this lively tale of sensuality and psychoses in a small Northwestern college town.  The characters snap and crackle in the best Krentz style, complete with coastal fog, excellent dog, and a supporting cast that not only supports, but also scene-steals in many places.  The passion is front and center (although maybe a little more would have been nice?), and it's easy to lose track of time while adventuring with these lovers.  I'm a confirmed JAK fan and I'm thrilled to see that vivacious turn of phrase back in play along with a sexy hero and a spunky heroine! Thanks, Jayne Ann - and welcome back!	2002-02-23

As a confirmed Linda Howard fan, I looked forward to a story I'd not yet read - but oh boy, this one was not one of her better efforts!  Linda's heroes are renowned for their \\"alpha\\" male characteristics, but Niko Constantinos takes it two steps past alpha, and does Greek men a disservice at the same time.  Jessica Stanton is a whiny, tearful idiot, who lacks the courage of her convictions.  She's also never read the instruction manual for heroines - you don't mention marriage the first time you're in bed with the hero!  Tsk tsk.  It's an interesting read for Howard fans, but if you're looking to try one of her books, don't start with this one unless you're still convinced that men are dominant and should control the lives of their women.  If you do feel this way, then by all means take this book back into your cave, but make sure you skin the woolly mammoth carcass before you settle down to read!	2002-02-16

Once again, Nora Roberts has given us a chance to escape to a delightful world of romance where the men are gorgeous and the women Princesses!  Cordina and Delaney, the protagonists, are perfect, strong when they need to be, opinionated, and striking sparks off each other from their first meeting!  Their gradual descent into the murky confusion of mutual attraction is enormous fun, and it's especially delightful to watch rugged Delaney Caine's facade of macho imperturbability disintegrate around him with the help of home-cooked meals and pot-pourri!  It is indeed a typical Roberts romance - but few do it as well and very few do it any better!  It's a joy to lose oneself in this charming tale of passion vs. poise, elegant female vs. elemental male - this book has everything we read romances for!  A definite keeper.	2002-02-12

The heartbreaker of the title is a perfect Howard hero - John Rafferty, big, handsome, quite arrogant, and a &quot;my way or the highway&quot; kind of guy.  The heroine, Michelle Cabot, is another typical Howard creation, a woman who's abilities are seriously misjudged by the hero, who looks at her with his hormones not his heart! These two make a splendid pair, and their romance kept me spellbound - even though I am not particularly fond of a plot which involves abuse and stalking themes.  Linda Howard's dynamic writing style and wonderfully sensual love scenes dominate this tale of courage and discovery - I very much enjoyed it, and didn't realize until toward the end that it was indeed a continuation of Diamond Bay.  It goes with the rest of the Linda Howards on my keeper shelf.	2002-02-12

OK, I confess, I am a devout fan of Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter extraordinaire and her cohorts, wild and wonderful people who inhabit these tales with verve and humor!  What's not to like in an eccentric (and armed) Grandma or a confused but devastatingly attractive cop? If you have never enjoyed a Plum adventure, you might want to try starting at the beginning (One for the Money)although each story is stand-alone fun!  However, I think much of the richness of this book comes from already having met these characters in earlier novels and watching them grow - my enjoyment was enhanced by my history with these wonderful folks!  Stephanie has her inevitable highs and lows in this book as she pursues eldery Eddie DeChooch for bail-jumping - Joe Morelli is still making Stephanie itchy, Grandma still favors Stiva's Funeral parlor viewings as her entertainment of choice, there are FTA's to be brought in, and Ranger - ah yes, Ranger!!!  As we have come to expect (albeit with teeth clenched) Janet Evanovich has left us with another cliffhanger and it only took about ten minutes of screaming for me to get past it!!!  Janet must be an amazing person to create such a delightfully funny, wild and wonderful world - if you love laughter with your crime and romance, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to all the Plum books, not just this one - you won't regret it!	2001-06-19

An accident, medication and a romantic hideaway all help!  Then her wandering brother Max is caught at last when Maddie Montgomery crashes into his door and his heart!  These stories are deceptively simple yet carefully thought-out, and I became immersed quickly and easily in the lives of these people.  The sensuality is deftly smoothed into the mix and there is always humor to be found - along with a truly delightful dog with an attitude!!

There seems to be enormous potential in this book - a young novitiate kicked out of the convent and desperate to experience sensual joy; a life-hardened hero who may or  may not be into kinky sex and a murderer into the bargain; a call-girl in hiding and a troubled hunk of man who happens to also be a priest.  These elements could have blended into a fantastic erotic novel or a compelling mystery, but the combination of all these things produced, in my opinion, rather a muddle.  Do they, don't they, will she, or has she already, nothing is ever really clarified and although the sexual tension is well developed, it never seems to be as resolved as it should be. The characters act rather irresponsibly, without their motivation being fully explored, and Ms. Forster's use of Catholicism throughout the story just muddies the waters.   I believe that there is the possibility that Suzanne may be a first rate writer - and I am going to try another of her books - but this one certainly wouldn't rank as her masterpiece.  Whatever point she was trying to make here never seems to be revealed.  Sorry!	2001-05-25

Actually, half-and-half might be a more appropriate analogy for this quartet of love stories.  The first two, by Suzanne Forster and Lori Foster, live up to their billing.  The hilarious affair between secretary Abigail and unaware boss Max builds to a delicious climax featuring a striptease!  And Lori Foster follows by introducing us to the Winston boys, specifically the eldest, Cole, who is seduced by Sophie twice, once as herself and once as her decadent twin sister.  Wonderful characters, delightfully sensual settings - it can't get much better!  And unfortunately, it doesn't.  While the other two tales are sweet romances, they don't compare well with the crisp sparkle of the first two stories.  The plots are bland, and the characters are almost too good to be true.  It was worth buying this book for the first two tales, but the second two are a disappointment.	2001-05-25

If you like your romance steamy, your men hot and your women feisty then these two stories are a must-have for your collection.  Jayne Ann Krentz gives us a vintage tale of love, lust and confusion between detective Josh January and innkeeper Maggie Gladstone.  This is wonderful Krentz stuff, the affair is believable, the characters charming and the story holds us to the last kiss!  Lori Foster gives us a harder-edged tale of brotherly love taken to a new dimension when Dane Carter replaces identical (and dead) twin Derek at the helm of their company and in the bed of former girlfriend Angel Morris.  A tale that could have become sloppy and unpleasant remains taut and enthralling, the steamy sensuality will melt your heart and leave you cheering for the eventually triumphant couple.  Cetainly the plots are predictable, and there is little mystery in whodunnit, but do we buy romances for mystery? You'll find plenty of what we do buy romances for between the covers of this book!!!	2001-05-24

I did find myself wanting to yell at them occasionally - when you are being stalked you don't do anything alone - aaarrgh!!!

Stephanie Laurens is truly an incomparable author of lusty romance and vibrant characters.  This is the third Cynster story, devoted to Richard Cynster and his pursuit of the fiery Catriona Hennesey.  We are lured into a tale of passion, magic and age-old lore, filled with wonderful characters, interesting stories and settings, and overlying all an amazing romance between the two protagonists.  Richard is everything a woman could possibly desire, and Catriona is a strong-willed woman who will find a way to achieve her goals no matter what the cost.  I loved this book (yes the sensuality level is &quot;R&quot; on this one) and have reread it several times.

In &quot;The Devil to Pay&quot;, Jayne Ann Krentz clearly shows the foundations of her trademark style.  Emmy Stratton and Julian Colter strike sparks from their first meeting (and we have to love Xerxes the dog).  Written in the mid '80's, Jayne reaches a point where she allows her heroines to be feisty, opinionated and to take risks - some with the hero - there is much less surrendering here and much more mutual satisfaction.  The dialogue is delightfully witty (another soon-to-be-Krentz trademark) and the plot is carefully crafted as always.  If you are looking to spend some time watching two lovers stumble into their future together, this is the book for you.	2001-05-23

Jayne Ann Krentz (writing here as Stephanie James) spins wonderful romances and this is one of her early works.  Although written in the '80s, the distinctive Krentz style is already becoming evident as the tale of Ariana and Lucian unfolds against a backdrop of fraud and finance in the Northwest.  Unlike some of her other early books, this one features a more definitive Krentz heroine who gives as good as she gets!  The sensuality level is higher with this book as well, and it is easy to get a good handle on the characters, even though at first, Ariana seems a little hard and calculating.  Ms. Krentz' ability to paint in delightful secondary characters starts to show here - don't miss Aunt Phil, a real charmer!  I'd recommend this as a great vacation read!!	2001-05-23

It is very difficult to write a comment about a perfect book - and this is it!  &quot;Devil's Bride&quot; has everything a romance should have - an amazing hero, the ideal heroine, a great plot, wonderful settings, and delightful secondary characters.  If there was a romance how-to-textbook, this would be the entire section on historicals!  Devil Cynster and Honoria Anstruther-Wetherby are the perfect foils - Devil's arrogance and dominating habits clash wonderfully with Honoria's sense of honor and independence.  When the seduction is finally completed, they discover a world of sensuality that tosses them (and the reader) into a maelstrom of passion, excitingly well written, and eminently believable.  It is so easy to lose oneself in the world of the Cynsters - how wonderful that there are so many of them and they all have their own story!! Bravo Ms. Laurens - nobody does it better!!!	2001-05-23

As a Jayne Ann Krentz fan, I was slightly disappointed in this book.  It made me feel as if she was tentatively dipping her toes into the genre of romantic fiction, but was hesitant to go all the way.  The heroine, Selena Caldwell, needed a bit of backbone - could one really have an immediate affair with the guy who just told you your fiance is married?  I found the characters insufficiently involving to allow me to accept that, and, frankly, I didn't like York Sutherland.  Driven guys are OK, but he seemed slightly obsessive, overly arrogant, and Selena should have given him a boot up his ego several times before surrendering to his charms.  Other Stephanie James books are better - try those first.	2001-05-23

The Silver Snare introduces us to Jessie and Lucas and the concept of being out of control.  Unfortunately, I found myself with little sympathy for Jessie, who was having enormous difficulty dealing with her need for Lucas versus her need to be in control.  I wanted her to either tell him to get lost or take him to bed - don't dither about.  Of course, if she had, there would have been no story!  So I guess this means that the plot here had some loose fibers and the characters didn't quite involve me enough to overlook them.  If you like romance, start with vintage Jayne Ann Krentz (try &quot;Deep Waters&quot;) instead of her earlier Stephanie James novels.  Once your taste for Krentz has developed then come back to these earlier books - the beginnings of her writing style are clear and fascinating to discover!	2001-05-22

For any Jayne Ann Krentz fan, her books are a must, even when written under the &quot;Stephanie James&quot; pseudonym.  However, these are her earlier books and it shows.  The sensuality that Jayne has developed to perfection is not yet in evidence - although I'm sure that Cassie and Justin's romance may have raised a few eyebrows back in the '80s.  However, Jayne always delivers a well-paced and carefully crafted book, predictable much of the time, but do we really buy romances for the plot?  No, we read them for that magic moment when the heroine allows the hero to sweep her to the giddy heights of burning passion, and Jayne Ann Krentz provides these moments better than anyone else!

Let's be realistic - most anything that includes a Stephanie Laurens story is going to be great and this one is no exception.  Her entrancing tale of  rediscovered love is a perfect example of her amazing talent when it comes to blending sensuality and humor.  I was less impressed with Victoria Alexander's tale of misunderstandings and rekindled romance - it was considerably more downbeat than the other two, although on its own probably would have been wonderful.  Rachel Gibson's contemporary love story is a delight - for all those women who have dreamed of knocking the socks off their high school buddies at a reunion.  This book is a great summer read, and the pleasure of anthologies is to be able to put them down and get a little work done in between stories!	2001-05-21

Whether writing as Jayne Ann Krentz or Stephanie James, you can always be assured of a delightful romance and that holds true for &quot;Fabulous Beast&quot;.  I note that the original publishing date is 1984; this may explain why the plot lacks some of the depth and enchanting secondary characters of her later books (see &quot;The Golden Chance&quot;, &quot;Silver Linings&quot; or &quot;Deep Waters&quot;).  However, if you've a mind to float away for a couple of hours and share a romantic adventure with a wonderfully normal heroine (she actually has hips, for goodness sake) then join Tabitha on her cruise and enjoy her seduction of the mysterious Dev Colter.

An interesting treatise on an interesting topic - underclothes.  As a writer of historical romances, I need to know what is under the heroine's clothes, should the hero get around to removing them.  This book has helped in my search for answers to that important question.  The illustrations are excellent and it is quite fascinating to realize how much we do (and don't) know about what our ancestors wore and why.  However, this book does seem to spend a lot of time on men's underwear (yes it's important, but not as much as the ladies'), and also covers such a large time period that inevitably some discussions are very brief (no pun intended).  This book will become part of my reference library - not a stand-alone source, but complementary to my other volumes on clothing.	2001-05-20

This wonderful anthology seems dedicated to those women who believe that it is possible to wear thigh-high hosiery without a wobbly wodge of flesh overhanging the delicate lacy tops, or that an intricately engineered bustier can be removed by a hunk without leaving nasty red welts on tender flesh!!  For the rest of us whose chunks and curves can't handle Sears' best, let alone Victoria's Secret, this is a delightful trip down fantasy lane, complete with sexy guys, sensually unawakened heroines and happy endings all around.  Suzanne Forster unbuttons a modern day Gibson Girl, Lori Foster continues her tales of the Winston brothers (don't miss Chase Winston's story in &quot;Charmed&quot; - it's a howl!!), Kimberly Randall dresses true love in a sinful costume, and Maggie Shayne shows us that efficient secretaries can be sexy too!  All these stories are great fun, with a pleasing dash of eroticism built into their characters.  I would be unable to pick a personal favorite, they are all charming tales peopled with fascinating characters.  I highly recommend this anthology as a wonderful summer or airline read - the short stories allow you to put the book down for a while if necessary - although you'll probably want to streak through all of them at once as I did.	2001-05-20

In this sequel to the delightful &quot;Eclipse Bay&quot; we meet the feudin' Hartes and Madisons once again.  This time, Lillian Harte falls victim to the charms of Gabe Madison and love and mayhem ensue. Unfortunately, this book doesn't hold up as well against the original, in my opinion.  The sparkle and wit that permeated the first book is not as prevalent (maybe I just missed Winston the dog) and because much of the Harte/Madison conflict had been resolved by Rafe and Hannah in &quot;Eclipse Bay&quot;, the feud as a plot device was lacking!   However, these comments are not meant to dissuade any potential readers - Jayne Ann Krentz is truly a master of her genre and you won't find a better lighthearted romance around than one with her name on it!!

The Hartes and the Madisons are at it again - this time, it's Lillian Harte and Gabe Madison who become swept into each other's passion.  Thankfully, Ms. Krentz understands her readers well enough to directly continue on from &quot;Eclipse Bay&quot; - it is enormously satisfying to have such continuity between the stories.  These families have a zest for life and a strength of will and commitment that leaps off the page, although I must confess that I found the romance between Hannah and Rafe a little more vibrant.  However, this was a fun read and Jayne Ann Krentz knows how to weave a wonderful tale.  Bring on volume 3 - I can't wait to find out about Nick and Octavia!	2001-05-03

In Fancy Pants, Susan Elizabeth Phillips introduces us to two excellent characters - the spoiled rich witch and the down-home down on his luck golfer.  Unfortunately, I found it a real slog to actually get to where these two are introduced!  I realize the necessity of a well-developed back story, but I felt rather smothered by it in this book. Sparks fly when Francesca and Dallie are together, but they're not together often enough or early enough.  As always, Ms. Phillips' writes a thoughtful book, with lovely secondary characters, and vibrant leads.  But I find her books erratic - &quot;Nobody's Baby&quot; had a delightful wit and charm which I missed in the sequel.  Here, there seems a combination of humor and desperation!

This book seems to be a &quot;doublemint&quot; novel (two-books-in-one) and I'm not sure if either story benefits.  I love the characters - Brittany and Dalden are absolutely perfect for each other, but I was left with the feeling that I would have liked one story about their meeting on earth and Dalden's delightful adventures with our unusual species to be separate from the story of Brittany's adjustment to life elsewhere.  I also wanted to give her a kick occasionally - has this woman made it to twenty-eight without running into any Star Trek episodes? Not even Star Wars?  Please - get real!!  As always, Ms. Lindsey's stories are polished and well thought out; I suppose I enjoyed reading about these two so much I'd have liked their tale to have been told in two parts.

The Dempsey girls turn a small town upside down with their cameras, philosophies, friends, lovers and pets!  Mix in plentiful amounts of head-bangingly great sex, murder, blackmail and greed and you have one of the best novels I've read in a long time.  Laughing out loud at the written word is a tribute to the author and I am prostrate before Jennifer Crusie's awesome talent to write such amazing dialogue.  I immediately wanted to read everything else she has ever written!  Thanks for the joyride into Temptation, Jennifer!	2001-04-28

I was thrilled to see a Stephanie Laurens book I had not read because I have much enjoyed her many novels including the dynamic Cynster series.  However, I must confess to being a little disappointed in these two stories.  The protagonists were charming (the heroes, in particular, showed that wonderful Laurens oooh-factor) but neither came up to the standard she has set in her recent books.  The sensuality we have come to expect was missing and although the stories were well-written, the spark wasn't there.  I can't wait for another Cynster story - Stephanie Laurens has a rare gift to be able to create fantasy men who meet just about every woman's notion of the perfect seducer!  More Cynsters, please Stephanie?  This was a nice book, but you've spoiled your fans and we want passion not poise!!	2001-04-15

There is quite definitely a wonderful story here trying desperately to get out - much like your obnoxious ghost Spivey, but neither quite make it.  Hunter and Sibyl are clearly a great match and their scenes together are extraordinarily sensual (more information on his amazing &quot;talent&quot; please?); unfortunately, the confusion that permeates their affair also permeates the rest of the story and makes it hard to classify this as a couldn't-put-it-down-er.  For those of us who love the adventures of these eccentric folks it was a must-buy, but for those who are just finding Stella Cameron, I'd recommend &quot;More and More&quot; or &quot;Sheer Pleasures&quot; to whet their appetite, not this warm-hearted muddle!	2001-04-08

But I must confess that it was not as vintage a Quick book as I had hoped.  The relationship between Lavinia and Tobias lacked the sparkle and passion of her earlier lovers and the denoument lacked closure.  I agree with other reviewers that her Regencies of late have become plot driven - I miss the sigh-appeal of earlier heroes and the delightful eccentricities of previous heroines.  It was almost as if Jayne owed her contract a book at this time - although well thought-out and crafted as always, the sparkle wasn't there.  I would not recommend this as a starter Quick book to anybody - &quot;With this Ring&quot; or &quot;Mistress&quot; would top my list of passion at its best.  I shall continue to buy anything by Amanda Quick but with lower expectations.  She still writes a great book when compared to some other authors on the market.	2001-04-05

The characters are well drawn and entertaining, following a realistic pattern of behavior, rather than being manipulated to fit the plot lines.  I am not quite sure if it is true to the Regency period, the class lines were firmly established at that time and it would have been very difficult for Gwyn to be accepted and re-established into the Radley family after having &quot;worked&quot; teaching piano.  That said, I would recommend this as a lovely afternoon read and shall look forward to trying another of Ms. Thornton's books.	2001-03-07
