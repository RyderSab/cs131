I am now an Ann Bauer fan because she made me feel what it was like to be Eddie's mother and Jack's wife.  Ann Bauer did in this novel what other writers hope to do, and it was done with empathy and grace.	2005-10-11
US	46763673	R2JCQKQYEGTQR5	0679736379	385024829	Sophie's Choice	Books	5	1	5	N	N	Unimaginable heartache	William Styron is a master wordsmith.  Just as the holocaust was the ultimate example of cruelty that goes beyond imagining, so does this novel demonstrate the strength of the human spirit to survive despite having undergone the most vicious evil the world has ever known.  The cruelty that Sophie has known is overwhelming in its magnitude and her choice to live means undergoing a lifetime of recrimination by her own self.  Styron's bouts with depression are obvious \\"drivers\\" of the plot and its characters.  If you finish this book without breaking a large piece of your heart, read it again.  There is also indomitable strength and hope in Sophie's character that will make all of us re-think our own darkest hours.	2005-09-11

Hers is a sorrow that goes beyond tears and is not consolable by anything but the belief that her brother will somehow reappear.  Her parents' deep belief in God is of no solace at all to Alison - rather it is a source of contention between them.  One has the feeling that if tears began, they would never end.  I found it particularly poignant when her friends wanted her to contact Roy via the Ouija board - her pain was palpable.  I can only hope that the writing of this book was cathartic for her and that the good memories have begun to replace the deep sorrow with the passage of time.	2005-08-04

Their sexuality is used as a cessation of the pain and an understanding of their places in life.  The men they encounter are a means to an unachievable end.  Sex is not the point of these encounters for the women - they are not promiscuous, but in pain.  Perhaps this is universaly true and certainly worth examination.  Rachel is a very moving character - she has the intelligence to know how self-destructive her behavior is and yet she is not capable of stopping it since it brings a fleeting anesthetic to the pain she endures when she anticipates her mother's death. Her mother's belief in breast reconstruction is very moving and indicative of her strength in the face of adversity.  I am impressed by the way these characters are woven into the story line, and I found myself caring about all of them.  I look forward to reading more books by Lisa Glatt.	2005-07-18

I read it hoping to get some elucidation about some recent problems I have that I think may be caused by post-polio.  I am so fortunate to have lived a life relatively free of polio residuals after having had both bulbar and spinal polio.  I am grateful to my parents for their unrelenting belief in exercising limbs that would have atrophied without their help.  They did exercises with me and hired a physical therapist who was aware of Sister Kenny's methods to live with us and work with me every day.  They never gave up, so I never did either.  I find that much of my life has been lived the same way - I will never give up when I have made a commitment to do something, and have often exhausted my physical resources by being this way.  I remember being in an iron lung, having to have a tracheotomy, the spinal tap, isolation, rocking beds, crutches, leg braces and then realizing the ultimate goal of walking again.  I hated not being able to run like my classmates, but my parents unfailingly pointed out that many of the children in my polio ward would never ever be able to walk again and I should always be grateful for all the people who brought me back from the very brink of death.  I acknowledge being an A+ personality type and the onset of my present disabilities is particularly difficult to accept after having gone \\"through the fire\\" once.  I still think often of the children in my ward who died from complications of polio and I would like to think that I fought so hard to be whole for them, too.  Thank you, Edmund Sass, for a worthwhile book.  I am now going to pursue more information and perhaps treatment for post-polio symptoms.	2005-06-28

It is interesting to watch her transform into a member of the working world after going through the normal angst and excitement of adolescence and college life.  She is somewhat lacking in ambition as evidenced by living with her brothers, grandmother and friend while job hunting.  I think that most of us wouldn't envy that nomadic lifestyle that seemingly went on for a very long time.

This is not a great novel that will leave its readers searching for meanings and understanding more about life than they did before reading it.  That said, it is a stroll back into the teen years when all of us experienced - some more than others - the complexitiies, insecurities and awkwardness of high school.  Shallowness and self-absorption are the constant companions of both males and females at this age. <br /> <br />I think that Curtis Sittenfeld did a great job of portraying this age group.  Am I the only one who remembers being embarassed by my parents and siblings, judging everyone by the clothes they wore and hoping to be noticed by that one special person of the opposite sex?  There is both poignancy and disbelief when I look back, but I don't think I would be the person I like today when I look in the mirror if I hadn't paid my dues as a teenager. <br /> <br />I credit Curtis Sittenfeld with knowing her subject matter - prep school adds one more layer to the teenage angst.  I enjoyed reading it and cringed a bit when I recalled myself at that age.	2005-06-12

I found the dilemma of the sisters heartbreaking, but took some solace in their having each other.  From what I've read, this personality split is what happens when a child is overwhelmed with pain.  It is perhaps the only defense mechanism that remains to someone who is trapped in a monstrous situation like Carrie.  To be surrounded by mental illness and abuse would lead to any form of self-preservation possible.  This is utterly heartbreaking and, sadly, a reality for too many children.  I went back to the beginning after finishing this book to note how artfully it was written.  The perspective couldn't have been told by anyone other than a young child and still carry the profound impact it does.	2005-04-30

Now that I've read it, I am disappointed.  I thought the conversations were too glib and the \\"crisis\\" situations handled with too little real poignancy.  I also couldn't understand why two SSGs like Astor and Rosanelle had been tolerated for 30 years.  The episode of Astor meeting Cal (or whomever) after hours was never really addressed to resolution.

I liked this novel a great deal at the beginning - interesting premise and well-drawn characterizations through the eyes of the narrator.  By the middle of this book, I was starting to daydream through the same repetitive passages that I had already read and by the end I was skimming to finish it.  However, I found at the end that I had not been patient enough -the pivotal conclusion was finished in several \\"meaty\\" pages.  I am left wondering if the author got a call from the publisher asking for a quick end, so Denise Mina finished it immediately. By then, I think we had all tired of the seemingly endless navel gazing and preening self-importance of the main character, so perhaps it's just as well that it ended when and how it did.  In my opinion, this book is not a \\"keeper.\\"	2005-02-03

This novel also lends itself well to introspection and character examination.  By the end of this book, the reader is well acquainted with the character flaws and strengths of the main characters.  At the conclusion of the novel, I was sympathetic to all of them - even Spencer, whose pomposity and unyielding righteousness had made him very unlikeable.  This is, on the surface, a novel about vegans vs. hunters; however, what makes it spellbinding is the knowledge of the characters we glean.  I think we also take away the irrefutable fact that good things do sometimes result from tragic circumstances.	2004-12-29

Lillian seemed, although very erudite, to be very unlikeable from her childhood until she herself became a mother.

Early in the novel, I attempted to understand what made Kevin the way he was; later, I held my breath awaiting the inevitable emotional and/or physical destruction that he would inflict.  The ultimate mystery is not what created someone without any feelings of connection, but why his father couldn't accept the horrendous workings of his son's mind before the ultimate tragedies.  Kevin's interactions with his mother were heartbreaking and cannot, I believe, be understood by anyone without a psychopath in his or her life.

Frankly, I was surprised to learn that Early was a remarkably good student and apparently considered to be a steadying influence by his peers.

I read this book quickly, so possibly I missed some of the logic that would lead two married 46 year olds to abandon evryone significant in their lives to be together.  Their relationship didn't make sense to me - surely we all have a special girl- or boyfriend from our teen years.  I simply cannot see myself overcome with lust in a public place upon first sighting of someone I thought I loved 31 years ago.  I'd like to think we both required a longer period of reconnection.  Also, how did both parties have so much unfettered time?  Did Charles' financial worries disappear when he bought champagne, gifts, meals and a hotel room for them?

The outcome is anticipated long before the end of the book and all's well that ends well.  Shattered relationships are mended, the bad guy gets his comeuppance and everyone ends up with his or her soulmate.  I like this book - it leaves me with some lingering thoughts.  I very much liked when the grandmother said that - I'm paraphrasing - good things are invisible: integrity, kindness, empathy, etc.  How true and how worthy of pursuit in thought and deed.  I've also given some thought to what I would select if I had a choice of a &quot;gift&quot; such as the ones that were bestowed on the Sparrow women when they turned 13.  I believe that often in life, as in this novel, our greatest gift is also our greatest curse.	2003-07-26

The father is a totally sympathetic character who is faced with the selfishness of a step-daughter, the weakness of a step-son and the generosity of a daughter who is challenged by trying to provide for her nuclear family at the same time she ministers to him.  This book is unlike &quot;Fine Balance&quot; in that it doesn't directly address political situations that make difficult lives even more so.

Haven Kimmel has created an &quot;everyman&quot; small midwestern hometown in the '50s where people knew their neighbors and children grew up with strong relationshps to family and friends.  Trust was a given then and suspicion of people one didn't know was rare.  It is apparent that Zippy profited from a childhood where she was free to make her own decisions and draw her own conclusions.  My favorite character is her dad, who treated Zippy, her sister and brother with the respect that everyone is due and allowed them to enjoy his wonderfully dry humor.  He was also not a hypocrite, so they gained an early insight into integrity of character.  I liked everyone I &quot;met&quot; in the pages of this wonderful book.

I found the literary references to be thought-provoking, the details of each person's life to be exquisitely crafted and the humor to be sharp.  I felt as if I knew this small town in Indiana quite intimately by the time Langston met daily with Alice's daughters.  I majored in English at Indiana University, so I also appreciated Langston's observations of the academics who reign in their own narrow world.

I was completely immersed in the plot and characters of this book from the beginning.  I rarely think that a book merits a five-star rating, but this is a real treasure.  I learned a lot about India and its politics as an adjunct to the lives of the characters - there was no sermonizing, moralizing or self-pity.  The characters dealt with things as they were to the best of their abilities.  Our limited understanding of the conditions under which they lived made their actions and reactions very real.  I found the writing to be tight and just right for the tone of the book - no spare sentiments that weren't necessary to achieve the insights required.  The ending is superlative - it is the way the book had to end in order to complete our knowledge of the lives lived.  The utter despair is beyond comprehension for those of us who live with a sense of security that we seemingly take for granted.  It will be difficult to find a worthy successor to read now that I have finished this book.	2002-05-13

There is not one likeable character doing one kind, charitable or generous act during the entire plodding book.  I am not looking for an uplifting book with a &quot;message&quot; or a puerile happy ending, but I would like to think that there is more to life and living than is characterized in this book.  I like books that make me think while I am reading them and, if I am fortunate, when I have finished reading them.  Jonathan Franzen has created a group of greedy, self-serving characters who never deviate from our initial introduction to them.  The author has talent - the characters are well defined and the plot makes sense within the confines of the structure created by Franzen.  The world is surely peopled by persons who belie his definition of living within a family.  This book saddened my heart.	2002-04-11

The innocence of the '50s juxtaposed with the &quot;sophisticated&quot; main character is compelling.  I found her mother to be equally interesting in her love/hate relationship with her daughter.  Intelligence was evidently not a desirable attribute in a southern girl at that time and Gloria's struggles with that make this an absorbing read.  As an English major, I loved the references to what she had read and was reading.  Gloria's conflicts with her inner and outer self and the &quot;secret watcher&quot; are worth a few second thoughts.  I liked this book and I was disappointed when it ended.  I will see  what else Keith Maillard has to offer.	2002-03-28

I just finished plowing through Oprah's last pick, Fall on Your Knees (which I did with gratitude when I had finished) - no comparison.  Please, Oprah, take a look at Katzenbach.	2002-03-04
US	46763673	RL69SSX28LIS2	0743418700	768832350	Salem Falls	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Nothing special	I was hoping for more from Jodi Picoult after reading her other books.  This is a pedestrian plot with unremarkable characters and an outcome that is predictable.  By the time I waded through to the end, I was skimming the pages to finish it.  I didn't particulary like or dislike any of the characters and I found the plot lacked believable substance.  I should have foreseen it when a recently-released prisoner was picked up by a cab driver and taken to an idyllic destination where he immediately melded into the landscape.  I know that Picoult can do better and I am eagerly awaiting her next effort.	2001-05-30

This is a book that will make its readers take a good, hard look at the depth of their own meaningful relationships to see if they would survive a devestation of the magnitude suffered by the Mulvaneys.  This book is about people who prefer to maintain appearances at all cost and the cost is, indeed, very dear.	2001-03-21

Judging by the reviews, this is a book that readers either really like or really don't like.  Count me in into the latter group.  I have been a Hamilton fan since &quot;Map of the World,&quot; but I was very disappointed in this book.  The characters were not realistic, despite an intriguing and viable premise.  In my opinion, the adolescent son's voice was stilted and the parents were both too weak to inspire the readers' empathy or interest.  I didn't like any of the characters and forced myself to finish the book, hoping for a meaningful resolution, which didn't come. I hope Jane Hamilton will get back on track with her next book.	2000-12-29
US	46763673	RDH4Z9H1MGH6C	0385333757	64473411	Losing Julia	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Simply touching	This is a book that intrigued me when I read the excerpt on the cover, and I found it more than fullfilled the initial promise.  It is quite touching, thought-provoking and very well written.  It gives the reader insights into many life-altering moments and describes the friendship and love that evolve for a very special man.  The juxtaposition of a youth in World War I and the life of an elderly man sorting through his memories in a nursing home will touch every reader's heart and deepest emotions.  It is a story of courage and honor.  I am still thinking about the passage that described Michaelangelo when asked why he had a chisel.  His response was that he was going to &quot;free an angel.&quot;  This passage is representative of the wonderful &quot;nuggets&quot; in Losing Julia, which should be savored slowly.  I look forward with great anticipation to reading every subsequent book written by Jonathan Hull.	2000-12-26

I found the characterizations to be well done.  At the end of this novel, the reader has a good comprehension of their motives, their insecurities and their hearts.  I look forward to more insightful books from Christina Schwarz.	2000-12-20
US	46763673	R36P5HI9VMTRV6	1579620663	94553092	Harry & Ruth	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Intriguing	Once I settled into the &quot;rhythm&quot; of this book, I found it very readable.  Due to the juxtaposition of past and present, I initially had a difficult time sustaining an impression of anyone except Harry and Ruth.  Their continuation in each other's lives for more than 50 years was believable and touching, and I found the ending to be poignant and in keeping with the tenor of their story.  The characters are well defined and believable, and there are some unexpected plot surprises.  This book is a testament to the impact of the written word, as witnessed by the long-enduring &quot;pen-pal&quot; status of the two characters.	2000-12-11
