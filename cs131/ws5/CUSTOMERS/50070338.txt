One is constantly amazed in this book by the extent of John Walker, Jr.'s treachery, deceitfulness and total psychpathology.  There isn't a person he doesn't try to use, a life he doesn't try to destroy.<br /><br />It also shows the utter incompetence of US military intelligence security.  Walker, his son Michael, and his main accomplice, Jerry Whitworth, stole secrets with impunity and never came close to being caught until Walker's ex-wife turned them all in.  Michael was working in secure areas with access to all sorts of classified materials and didn't even have a security clearance--no one bothered to check to see if he had one.  Walker faked his way through a regular five-year security background check just by forging an \\"approved\\" stamp for under $3.00 and stamping his personnel file.<br /><br />The book is well-written and fast-paced.  Michael Walker served 15 yrs of a 25 yr sentence and is now free but his father deservedly remains in prison.	2004-09-14

The story follows the gamut of Mormon frontier history and Tompkins is at all of the pivotal moments, meets all the important real-life characters, etc.<br />Along the way he marries a number of different women, gets caught up in LDS controversies and goes from owning only the shirt on his back to becoming one of the wealthiest men in Utah.<br />I don't know if author Eric Alter is LDS; probably not since his book has some bodice-busting moments.  But it is an entertaining book whether one is LDS or not.	2003-05-18

If the book criticizes Mormonism, the Mormon reviewers inevitably slam the book, call it fiction, say that it slanted, biased, uninformed, etc., etc.<br />That being said, I thought &quot;The Mormon Murders&quot; was excellent.  The authors obviously had extensive information from insiders on the case, particularly some of the police officers and prosecutors.  Mark Hoffman, perhaps the most accomplished forger in American history, manipulates and tricks everyone he comes in contact with, duping them like the con-man extraordinaire he is.  And despite their alleged power of discernment, the Mormon leadership is duped even more easily than the common people in the book.<br />There was never a thorough, public accounting of the Hoffman case because the LDS leaders pressured the prosecuting attorney to lower the charges and let Hoffman plea-bargain---thus saving high-ranking LDS leaders from having to testify under oath.<br />This story has been depicted by a few different books.  After this book, &quot;Salamander&quot; and &quot;A Gathering of Saints&quot; painted uncomplimentary versions of the LDS Church's complicity in these crimes the Church fought back in a round-about way by having some LDS scholar write a book called &quot;Victims&quot; and publish it through the Univ. of Illinois.  Don't be fooled--the book's main purpose is to try and exonerate the LDS leaders from looking like idiots at best and conspirators at worse.<br />I've read that the rights to &quot;The Mormon Murders&quot; were purchased by a network.  It is a great story for a TV movie and yet, not surprisingly, it has never made the big screen or little screen.  Does anyone have to guess why?	2003-05-18

He was first elected as I recall in 1980 as part of the Reagan Revolution.  He was a decent enough fellow, did his job conscientiously and probably with his background in agricultural issues might've ended up as a Secretary of Agriculture perhaps.  Whatever his rise was in the Republican Party it pretty much was ended after he was \\"outed\\" although I was impressed in the book about his friendship with Newt Gingrich and Gingrich's acceptance of his homosexuality (then again, one of Newt's sisters, I believe, is gay).  Say what you want about his personal lifestyle, if it had a bearing on his political future (and how could it not have) then it was the public's loss in the long-run to have a conscientious congressman like Gunderson take himself out of the political arena.<br />Being the only gay GOP congressman, Gunderson's book is worth reading if only for that fact.  I had moved out of his district by the time he was \\"outed\\" by \\"B-1\\" Bob Dornan but I recall having heard years earlier about his being gay and knew that one of his Democratic challengers during his tenure had struggled with the idea of outing Steve himself in order to try and win the election; this was long before Dornan decided to do what he did.  In the end the Democratic candidate decided to keep the news to himself, so to speak, and not make an issue of it.  He was soundly defeated in any event, by Gunderson.	2003-04-19

The Robertsons are attempting a circumnavigation when their yacht is sunk by killer whales in the Pacific Ocean.  With very few provisions, an inflatable raft (which later sinks) and a dinghy the Robertsons are able to survive 38 days on the ocean under extreme conditions.<br />Dougal Robertson's account of the adventure is gripping, at sometimes understated and brutally honest.  Robertson was probably not an easy man to get along with but his indomitability, his command presence and force of will, coupled with his wife's emotional strength, got their family through.  It is a tremendous story of leadership under the most extreme circumstances.<br />While looking up information on the Robertsons I was happy to find their own website, ... but was saddened to read that both Dougal and Lyn Robertson have since passed away.  One of their twin sons however is preparing to embark on a round-the-world cruise with his own family soon.	2002-08-24

Vol. 10, \\"The Remnant\\" is only marginally better than Vol. 9's \\"Desceration.\\"  At least the time-line pace has picked up.  Where some books only covered a few days, this one has covered over a year of time.<br />Having read 10 volumes so far I will stoically see the series to its conclusion but I'm getting a bit weary of Jenkins' style of writing (Jenkins does all the real writing, LeHaye only gives him outlines about the Biblical prophesies).  Page after page will be just dialogue between characters with no interruption to set a scene, to indicate any subtext.  \\"The Remnant\\" spent probably over 100 pages on the rescue of Sebastian alone.  C'mon!<br />The series has been at its best when it focuses on the plagues and miracles and on the evangelism.  And the scenes involving Carpathia are always entertaining.  But the story inevitably bogs down when it focuses on the other characters.  It is evident in this book that Jenkins was trying to spread the action around.  Buck Williams and Rayford Steele dominate most of the action of the earlier books and in \\"The Remnant\\" they are given very little to do.  But the other characters aren't that particularly interesting to me. There are just too many characters in the story.	2002-08-05

Stuart's adventures and his zest for life make him one of children's literature's most memorable characters.  I thought that \\"Stuart Little\\" was E.B. White's best book, far better than \\"Charlotte's Web.\\"<br />My favorite parts of the book include the epic sailboat raise between the WASP and the LILLIAN B. WOMWATH in Central Park, with Stuart heroically helming the WASP to victory, especially Stuart's interview with the dentist who owns the WASP.  \\"Do you drink?\\"  \\"I do my work,\\" said Stuart dryly.<br />Another great tale within the story is his date with the tiny girl, that he plans so mightily for only to have it be a disaster. . .his philosophical talk with the telephone repairman along the road. . .I felt that the ending of the book was just right, Stuart motoring off in his little car, looking for Margalo, not knowing where to find her but sensing that somehow he was going in the right direction.  Like all great children's literature, \\"Stuart Little\\" I think also strikes a deep chord with adults.  The book meant a lot to me, having read it as a child, when I read it for the first time to my own son.	2002-07-26

Unfortunately for modern Mormons, their early leaders were prolific speakers and writers and volume after volume of their musings on the principles of their faith is available.  And since even most modern Mormons find it as upsetting and as cultish as non-Mormons do, they spend most of their counter-argument attacking books like &quot;101&quot; or just dismissing the early LDS statements as being &quot;out of context&quot; or just the &quot;personal opinion&quot; of the founders of the faith.

Most of the Beatles story was already known by the fans and even by the non-fans.  What I really liked about this book was their accounting of their pre-fame days.  George Harrison's account of how he and Paul as teens hitchhiked for days, slept on beaches and bleachers, hardly had any money and were just two boys out to see the world was touching.  Paul and John going to Paris together after John gets a 100 pounds as a birthday gift.  The boys almost freezing to death in their unheated van, touring the country (George losing control of it, causing a wreck which injures Neil Aspinall, their roadie, and subsequently getting his license suspended!).<br />Ringo sums it up in the end when he says that the Beatles' story was about four guys who really loved each other.  That love really comes through in this book.  The four of them lived through an experience that no one else had been or ever will be through.  They managed to maintain their sanity and changed the world along the way. Not a bad way to live one's life.	2002-07-13

This isn't a TV Survivor game where people compete in contests, eat rice and vote each other off until someone wins the jackpot.  In \\"Alive\\" a group of students, their friends and family are trapped in some of the most inhospitable terrain and weather conditions in the world.  Only a few scraps of food, nothing but snow surrounding them, many of them grievously injured and not one piece of survival equipment.  And no one is \\"voted off\\".  If you don't survive, you die there.  One survivor sees his wife die in an avalanche, another loses his mother and sister, others lose cousins.  The oldest survivor is only 33, the youngest is 19.<br />Of 45 who left on the trip, only 16 survived and a few of them were close to dying when they were rescued.  It is simply a fantasic story of ingenuity, faith, brotherhood, and courage. The struggle of Canessa and Parrado to climb the mountain with no mountaineering gear in a desperate bid to try and save the others is just amazing.<br />There was an excellent companion documentary made in conjunction with the movie version of \\"Alive\\" and it is full of interviews with the survivors.  I later read that several of the survivors made an emotional trip back to the crash site and to the mass grave of those who died.  What a moment that must have been.<br />\\"Alive\\" is an inspirational book and the story of the sixteen will remain with you forever.	2002-06-28

I would guess that nearly every law student or prospective law student in the last 20 yrs has read this book or knows about it.  I read it myself before, during and after law school and while I found many things in the book true, much of what he described about law school I didn't experience at my school, Gonzaga University.  Granted, Gonzaga in the 1990s isn't Harvard in the 1970s but I doubt that even Harvard is like what Turow described.<br />Turow does accurately describe the crushing amount of work and the stress of law exams that 1Ls experience.  The obsession with grades, making Law Review, the clannish study groups were not part of my experience at Gonzaga and I doubt that it is the experience of most law graduates wherever they went to school.  Whatever law school you'll go to you'll work harder than you ever did in your life but it isn't the inhumane world that Turow describes, at least not where I went.  There's nothing magical about the top tier law schools in my opinion other than the prestige and post-grad networking.  The textbooks at Gonzaga were the same that Harvard used and the professors we had were on a whole very good with several Ivy League law grads amongst them.<br />The maxim a few of my classmates had probably is true in every law school--the first year they scare you to death, the second year they work you to death, the third year they bore you to death.  Turow's book does get the \\"scare you to death\\" part down.  I would've like to have seen his take on the 2L and 3L years as well.	2002-05-18

Army Col. Jim Thompson's story reminded me of the biblical story of Job, except in the end, unlike Job, Thompson loses even his faith and is left simply with his stubborn sense of personal survival.<br />If there was ever a man who never got a break in his life, it was Jim Thompson.  Raised by a domineering and abusive father, drafted into the Army he at first hates military life but then comes to love it.  But even in the military things do not come easily for Thompson.  Commissioned through OCS, he does not volunteer for Special Forces but is ordered into it when the Army, at JFK's directive, rapidly expands the Green Berets.  Sent to Vietnam, Thompson and his team are sent to one the most remote and potentially dangerous outposts the Army has and he and his team find themselves very quickly in over their heads.<br />An interesting aspect of the book is that most of it is not about Thompson's actual experiences as a POW but rather deals with is pre- and post-Vietnam life.  His saga as a POW for nearly 9 years is a brutal one---isolation, malnutrition, torture.  It is not until he has been a prisoner over 4 yrs that he finally meets other Americans, a group of soldiers and civilian personnel captures at Hue during the Tet Offensive.  By this point Thompson is reduced to about 100 lbs and looks to the other POWs to be in his 70s when he's actually in his mid 30s.<br />His story after his return is even more brutal---betrayal by his wife, divorce, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, career problems, totally dysfunctional children, attempted suicide, psychiatric hospitalization, struggling with his sexual identity, his son convicted of murder, suffering a stroke which handicaps him and finally a loss of faith in God.<br />Unlike other POW stories, I found nothing in this book to be uplifting.  The Thompson family is literally destroyed by the Vietnam War and there are almost no survivors.  The book is well-presented as an oral history of the Thompsons although his wife Alyce does come across as a villainess in the story.  And despite her attempts to paint herself in a better light, her own behavior is just inexcusable.War and there are almost no survivors.

The most interesting part of the copy I had was actually the introduction which detailed Daniel Defoe's career.  Defoe was in constant financial trouble and wrote \\"Crusoe\\" in part to get his creditors off his back, if only for a short while.  He sold the copyright to the book for a mere 100 pounds only to see the book become the best selling book of its time, the early 18th century.  Had he been able to keep the rights to it, he would've made a fortune.<br />  I am a fan of shipwreck stories such as Steven Callahan's \\"Adrift\\", Dougal Robertson's \\"Survive the Savage Sea\\" and the Bounty muntineers' survival story \\"Pitcairn's Island\\" all of which are true stories, or in the case of \\"Pitcairn's Island\\" based on true events.  So as a fan of the genre, I thought it was only fair that I read the original shipwreck story, \\"Robinson Crusoe\\".  I was very disappointed.  It is hard for a book written in 1717 to translate all that well into the 21st Century and I found Defoe's writing very stilted.  The best part of the the story is how Crusoe salvages the ship and solves the various problems he has living by himself. Had the book ended with his rescue, I would've liked it more.  Instead, the book then went on for several more chapters with Crusoe claiming his fortune and then going on a hunting expedition!  Defoe obviously didn't know how or when to end the story and it just petered out.  He later wrote a sequel on the further adventures of Crusoe and perhaps it is telling something about his writing and perhaps with the public losing interest in Crusoe that his Crusoe sequel is almost unheard of and unread today.<br />  The book's greatness, if any, is that it was the one of the first novels and it's success certainly must have inspired Defoe's more talented contemporaries to begin writing novels.  For that Defoe is deserving of thanks.  But if you want to read a great book about being on a deserted island, read \\"Pitcairn's Island\\" by Nordhoff and Hall which is simply terrific.on a deserted island, read \\"Pitcairn's Island\\" by Nordhoff and Hall which is simply terrific.	2002-04-14

Hough's book is an excellent reexamination of the story and of the complex relationship between William Bligh and Fletcher Christian.  While I don't agree with Hough's conclusions as to what was really at the heart of the mutiny (I won't spoil it for you by revealing that here) the relationship was combustible and was at the heart of the mutiny.<br />The Bounty crew were for the most part hand-picked and young.  Christian was only in his early 20s, Bligh was in his early 30s and only a very few of the crew were in their late 30s or early 40s.  Despite the popular image of the story, Bligh was actually pretty lenient with his crew when it came to punishment and he made it all the way to Tahiti losing only a single man.  During his epic open boat voyage after the mutiny, he made it to Coupang having lost only one man en route, although many of the survivors died within weeks of their rescue.  Bligh was a complainer, a nagger and had a viciously sharp tongue though which was more than the youthful Christian could bear.<br />Far from the heroic image that Christian is given in the movies, Hough shows that Christian was impulsive and not much of a leader.  While Bligh, sharp tongue and all, was able to save nearly all of the men who were kicked off the ship with him, Christian and his men met with disaster at almost every turn, primarily because Christian was a failure as a leader.  The mutineers' disastrous attempt to settle on Pitcairn Island is perhaps the most gripping and fascinating part of the story.<br />Hough's book is excellent and the Mel Gibson/Anthony Hopkins movie &quot;The Bounty&quot; was based on it and is by far the most authentic and best of the Bounty movies.	2002-02-12

I've read it many times over the years and find myself wholly captivated by it each time.<br />\\"Pitcairn's Island\\" follows the story of Bounty mutineer Fletcher Christian and eight of his men who are hunting for a sanctuary in which to hide from the long arm of the Royal Navy.  They bring their Tahitian wives and several Tahitian men along with them.  Finding Pitcairn's Island uninhabited, they settle there in 1790, less than a year after the mutiny.  The men range from about age 21 to 38, Christian himself was only about 24 yrs old although the movies always seem to depict him as being older.<br />The Pitcairn story operates on multiple levels--- the attempt by criminals to make a Utopian society, the conflict between the English and the Tahitians, the conflict between the men and the women, conflict between the educated officers, Christian and Young, and the low-born seamen.  The tiny colony struggles with alcoholism, race warfare, slavery, rape, insanity and even religious rebirth.  The story seems impossible to believe and yet all of it is true.  The mutiny story has made for several rousing motion pictures but they always end with the mutineers arrival at Pitcairn and never deal with what happened afterwards, which is the most fascinating part of the story.<br />Will some filmmaker PLEASE bring this story to the screen?	2002-02-11

Young fans, unless they're Packer history scholars, won't recognize most of the players in the book.<br />The book confirmed for me how ineptly the Packers were run in the 1970s and 1980s after enjoying so much glory during the Lombardi years.  Being a publically owned team, the board of directors took back for themselves the power that they had ceded to Lombardi and since they were guaranteed sell-outs at home regardless of how bad the team was and they were guaranteed profits due to revenue-sharing, they had little incentive to field a decent team.<br />So years were wasted while the Packers struggled under Packer hero Bart Starr who had almost zero coaching experience, only to see Bart get fired just as he was finally becoming a decent coach.  Forrest Gregg is brought in and the destruction of the team is completed.  Big surprise that the Packers in the 1990s didn't start turning around until the inept directors finally started giving real authority to football professionals like Ron Wolf and Mike Holmgren.<br />The book itself is just where-are-they-now stories but they do provide a realistic look at pro football.  Dan Devine, the coach before Starr, takes a beating in the book by many of his former players as does Gregg.  The person I felt most sorry for in the book was John Brockington.  Brockington was the first RB to gain 1000 yds each of his first three seasons and was All-Pro.  Most people considered him the best RB in the game at that time after OJ Simpson.  Then, inexplicably, Brockington's production fell off to almost nothing and the team dumped him.  \\"Downfield!\\" describes how the Packer executives decided to put Brock in his place, so to speak, and how there was practically a concerted effort by management and the coaching staff to ruin Brockington's career.  Outside of Packer fans, almost no one even knows about John Brockington now and the man, had he been treated right, probably would've gone to the Hall of Fame.  Brock, if you're reading this, you deserved much better! If \\"Downfield!\\" does anything else, it exonerates John Brockington for his fans.

While it is a stirring tale of man against the sea, it is also a great story of a man dealing with crisis, with loneliness, with self-doubt.  I've recommended this book to many people I've known who were in the midst of dealing with personal crisis---illness, divorce, loss of employment and such.  All of them have told me that the book moved them and helped them.<br />All of us can be &quot;adrift&quot; in life, feeling we're cut off from what is important to us, that the world seems to be against us.  Callahan's experience shows that it is possible to meet crisis with faith in God, faith in oneself, ingenuity and just sheer perseverence.  That if you do not lose hope, that if you endure, landfall and rescue are eventually going to happen.  What I thought was most inspiring about Callahan's book was that, after all he'd been through, he continued to go sailing.  Lesson?  That no matter how difficult an experience you've had, in a lousy job, a bad relationship or whatever, that after you've reached landfall and have recovered, you &quot;set out to sea&quot; again, seeking new challenges, new relationships, and new knowledge about oneself.	2001-08-13
US	50070338	R55AYL8ZHE1OR	031286504X	486151984	I Am Legend	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Legendary	This isn't just the best vampire story ever written, it is a great book in any genre.  I have read this book so many times that I've nearly memorized it and yet I enjoy it intensely every time I pick it up.  The book has many themes within it---loneliness, isolation, alienation are just a few---and you cannot help but put yourself in Robert Neville's situation.  What would I do if I were in his shoes?<br />It would make a tremendous movie if it stayed true to the original story (instead of Tom Hanks being marooned on an island, how about him marooned in a city of vampires?).  Charlton Heston's &quot;The Omega Man&quot; was based on &quot;I Am Legend&quot; but makes major changes in the story to have a more upbeat ending.  Don't watch the movie, read the book.<br />I will confess that I haven't read the other Matheson short stories in this collection but he is a magnificent writer.  &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; is probably his most famous work after &quot;I Am Legend.&quot;  He wrote the screenplay for the memorable &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode where the Enterprise crew and the Klingons are trapped on the ship by an alien being who feeds off of the emotions of anger and hatred.  He also wrote the screenplay for the sensational TV movie, &quot;Duel&quot; which was Steven Spielberg's first film.  It is easy to see the parallels between the isolated Robert Neville doing battle with a world of vampires and Dennis Weaver's &quot;everyman&quot; commuter who is having to battle it out with a faceless, psychotic truck driver on an empty highway.	2001-05-15

I'm surprised it hasn't been made into a movie.  It is a much better book than his follow-up, &quot;Skelter&quot;.  I think Perry got into Ted Bundy's personality much better than many of the non-fiction books on Bundy.  The friend of a friend of mine actually narrowly missed being a Bundy victim---she was in Tacoma and was followed home by a guy.  She got into her house, turned on the porch light and saw the guy's face through the window, but he left.  She didn't see his face again until she saw Bundy on TV the night before he was executed.	2001-03-22

Gave it another go later on and then it clicked with me. It is a tremendous book and it is the detail that makes you feel you're taking the trip in time yourself.  Instead of having Si Morely meet up with famous people, he interacts with the ordinary people of the time and it really brings the era to life.  I'll be honest, I thought that the sequel, &quot;Time After Time&quot; was a terrible and a waste of time.  Finney spent pages going on about 19th century vaudeville.  But &quot;Time and Again&quot; is just a terrific, warm and thoughtful book.  I thought I read once that Robert Redford owned the film rights.  It is a book that deserves to be made into a picture, no doubt about it.	2001-03-22

Feliz's book literally changed my life because after reading it I was encouraged to start really exploring the teachings and history of Mormonism.  The result was I got out and was freed from such an oppressive, soul-destroying institution.  Frankly, I thought Feliz's spiritual journey became pretty flakey but his observations on Mormonism and how the Church would hurt people was unimpeachable.  Thanks, Tony, for having the guts to say what had to be said.	2001-03-22

What draws me into the book are the unforgettable characters---Jay Score (was he the inspiration for Mr. Spock?), Capt. McNulty, the chess-fanatic Martians---Kli Yang, Kli Morg, Sug Farn, et al, and the narrator, the sergeant at arms who is never identified by name.  The stories are told in the first person and in a way it lets the reader become that character.  The only downside of the book is that, as far as I know, Russell never wrote any further stories about the crew of the Marathon.	2000-12-27

I remember reading it the first time, finding it in a stack of used books at school when I was in 4th or 5th grade.  I never wanted the book to end and I wanted so much to actually be in the story.  The characters are unforgettable, especially the brilliant Henry Mulligan, the screwy adventures are hilarious (my favorite was the balloon race), and the scientific parts of the book are entirely plausible.  You can really believe that a group of smart, motivated and inventive kids could do the things that the Mad Scientists do in this book.  How Disney never latched onto these stories and made a movie out of them or a series for the old &quot;Wonderful World of Disney,&quot; I'll never know.  I didn't grow up to be a scientist but no doubt hundreds of young people went on to careers in science because of reading this book.  How many childrens' books are so life-changing?	2000-12-27

James Tindell's book is a worthy first novel which takes a look into the not so distant future and involves the reader in a fast-paced, complex story of romance, science, ethics, and metaphysics.  The characters are well drawn and you cannot help but put yourself in the positions of the two main characters, the man who goes to any measure to save the life of his true love and the woman he saves but who ends up awakening in a world where everything she knows is gone or has changed.	2000-12-21

Peter Cohen takes you through his two years at the Harvard B School in the early 1970s and he does an excellent job of describing the backbreaking work and the ethos of graduate business education.  The characters of his classmates are well  described.  When I went to B School myself in the mid-1980s (at Ariz. St.  Univ.) I found that my experiences were very similar to Cohen's.	2000-02-12
