Thinking it would be filled with entertainment and intellectual debate, he finds himself dismayed to discover it is a betrothal party filled with simpering young maids. The only bright spot on this otherwise dreary event is Mrs. Christine Derrick.<br /><br />Having been widowed 2 years ago, she chooses to enjoy herself despite censure from other parties. Wulfric is drawn to her like a moth to a flame, and she to him. It is quite a surprise to Wulfric therefore, that she should turn down his proposal as both mistress and wife. Christine's reason? She believes that Wulfric is \\"ice to the core.\\"<br /><br />Wulfric sets out to prove to Christine that there is more to him then a title. That underneath beats the heart of a true man, who wears his title only has a mantle. It has just taken the right person to cause him to shed it. How these two people do their best to overcome self-imposed restrictions is what makes this book delightful. Seeing the entire Bedwyn clan together again in one book understand what made this series enjoyable to read.<br /><br />I can't wait to pass this book along to a friend and hope she enjoys it as much as I did.	2005-04-23

Having just finished this book a mere few moments ago, I'm still thinking about it. I'm not sure whether I am to root for Dexter or be appalled. Dexter himself is an enigma wrapped in a riddle. For all outwards appearances he is a relatively good guy, excellent at his work. His outside hobbies though, are far from average. He singles out the unjust that warrant death and give them that reward. For example, Dexter finally brings a priest who murders small children to task. He is methodical, careful and borderline psychopathic.<br /><br />When Dexter encounters another who seems to share the same bloodlust that he does, it compels him to discover this person. The last couple of chapters left me oddly happy that Dexter and perhaps Brian and Deborah may make another return. This is a darkly odd book. I liked it because it wasn't a cookie cutter whodunit. It was a strange exploration into the dark psyche of an everyday individual. It may make me rethink my co-workers just a bit J.  My only complaint is the supporting characters. Stiff, and wooden, they did not assist the story as much as detract from it. I wanted more flesh to Deborah, to Brian and even to Dexter himself.	2004-08-05

Unfortunately, as the series continues, it feels as if Feehan has run out of new ways to retell what is essentially the same story.<br /><br />I was hoping as I picked up \\"Dark Destiny\\", that perhaps the author had found a way: female Carpathian who survived abuse to become a female hunter. Hmmm the premise sounded intriguing, the execution of the storyline was not so good. It seems that the storyline is building up to something bigger (ie: Gregori taking slide samples to see if they could conquer vampirism etc) but at this point I'm ready to throw in the towel. Sure there are many steamy scenes that this series is known for, but throwing out a new name to an ancient isn't the way to attract or retain readers. Throw in a new twist, convert a vampire something anything, just don't leave us hanging.	2004-08-05

In this novel we encounter Sophia, who has left England fleeing a father who physically and mentally abused her. When her father passes away it is up to Adrian Burchard to retrieve Sophia back to England so that the 12 votes she commands can be utilized for a reform party.<br />This synopsis in no way captures the heat and strong-will that Sophia and Adrian have. The story revolves around Sophia dealing with the demons she lives with when it comes to her father, her deceased brother, and how all men, including Gerald, never see beyond the inheritance to the real woman. For the first time in her life she encounters a man who does, namely Adrian. After erecting figurative walls to protect herself from the hurt others may cause, will Adrian be strong enough to scale them? Will Sophia allow herself to overcome past hurts?<br />I genuinely enjoyed this book, and found myself captivated from the very start. I truly appreciated the strong wills of both Sophia and Adrian, and the struggles they both have to overcome to become friends and lovers. I only wish as a reader that we learned more about Adrian's parentage, and how despite his unique origins formed such a strong bond with brother Colin. I look forward to more of Madeline Hunter's books.	2004-06-10

Dubious heroine Samantha varies from righteous indignation, to easy capitulation. She hates Rudolf, she loves Rudolf, she speaks up for herself, she allows herself to be trampled all over. And for a hero Rudolf is sadly lacking. At times incredibly arrogant and rude, he persists in reminding Samantha and the reader that he is a prince and therefore entitled to unswavaring obedience from all his belongings including Samantha.<br />Were I Samantha and I had been hit in the eye, told I were a piece of chattel, publicly humiliated on a grand scale, and demeaned every day, the prince would have been history. Instead Samantha chooses to take him back time after time only citing the fact that she loves him.<br />I continued to read the book in hopes that Samantha would come to her senses, her family would intervene or divine providence would assist. As it neared the end and the pages dwindled, I realized that no such thing would happen. The only highlight in this book were the surrounding cast of characters, Aunt Roxie, Samantha's sisters especially Victoria and adopted sons Drake and Grant.<br />If you choose to read this book, don't be surprised to find yourself banging your head with the book, mentally screaming back at the pages telling Samantha to run and don't look back.	2004-05-29

In this novel Zoe McCourt's turn has come to find the last and final key to unlock the demigoddesses soul and outwit the evil Kane.<br />Zoe herself is an interesting person. At times seemingly prim and proper, she turns out to be quite the protective mama bear that won't accept help. The only reason why I honestly disliked this book was the hap dash ending. Having watched her two friends go thru the same struggles, Zoe had a relatively good grasp of what was required of her as did we the reader. In her quest to find herself and confront her past, she omitted the biggest aspect, that of her child's father. At a very young age Zoe became pregnant and left in shame. While she returned back to confront her mother who felt Zoe wouldn't amount to much, she never confronted her child's father as if to say \\"look at me now\\". He was mentioned a number of times, but nothing materialized.<br />Zoe also had to overcome her prejudices against Bradley Vane. Deeming him a snob on first encounter, she refuses to have anything to do with him, for she is embarrassed of her roots, afraid that he will look down upon her or she won't do the right thing. Isn't that rather oxymoronic and ultimately defeatist? A self-fulfilling prophecy waiting to happen? The Goddess Rowena deemed Zoe the one that she cared the most about, the warrior mother, and yet this mother had a lot to learn and not enough pages to do so in.	2004-05-27

In this novel we are reintroduced to Dana Steele and her story. Dana has had her heartbroken by Jordan Hawke many years ago, and never been fully able to get over him or the resulting heartache. Unfortunately for her Jordan is integral to this journey which means spending a lot of time with the one person she has envisioned dying a slow and painful death.<br />I liked Dana because of her flaws. Dana loves to read and spends her time doing what she loves only to find her foundation shaken from underneath her. She not only has to wrestle with her pride and heartache, but the future and it's possibilities. As she and her soul sisters open up their minds and hearts to each other as they form a business relationship. Dana finds it tougher to do the same in regards to Jordan. She has tremendous pride and learning to swallow that for Dana is a bitter pill, especially if she has to do so with Jordan.<br />\\"Key of Knowledge\\" was a fun, light book to read and relax to.	2004-05-27

Nora Roberts \\"Key of Light\\" is the perfect antidote for just such an occasion. Nora Roberts asks the reader to forget the mundane, and place reality on hold while you venture forth into rural Pennsylvania where fantasy has become reality. The Celtic tale \\"Daughters of Glass\\" is more than true in this series; it is alive. It is the story in which the evil sorcerer Kane has locked the souls of 3 demi-goddesses for a millennium. In order to save their souls and those of the watchers, 3 mortal women must find the keys that will unlock them.<br />The first of these women are Mallory Price. Just laid off of her job in an art gallery, the adventure and the cash bonus this quest provides are certainly incentive enough. Throw in finding two other women in the same position who become fast friends and a the potential love of your life and you have yourself a winner. I honestly liked this series. The snappy dialogue and steamy scenes far outweigh any sappiness predictability. Perfect summer reading.<br />I give this book 3 stars because of said predictability. The reader knows within a short period what the key symbolizes and how to acquire it.	2004-05-27

I genuinely enjoyed the story of Alexandra and Douglas Sherbrooke's stormy relationship, and how the finally settled into a decent couple. So it came as a complete shock to find that the qualities that drew me to them (their tempestuousness, spark and vigor) were completely devoid in this novel. Their children were equally as tepid; the only calling cards were their handsome good looks, which we were constantly reminded of. For every good Coulter book, there is an equally bad selection, and unfortunately this is one of the bad ones. On the plus side, it does set up the potential for a good Coulter book to come next.	2004-05-06

I received this book as a pre-release copy from the publisher and was able to read it over the weekend. \\"Master of Temptation\\" proved to be a master at commanding my attention.<br />On the island of Cyrene, Major Max Leighton brings a wounded soldier for healing, only to find himself a guardian angel in Caro Evers. After one night of passion they part ways, both holding the memory of that night close to their heart. One year later their lives intertwine again, when Max volunteers to assist in planning the escape of Caro's good friend Isabelle.<br />They quickly fall back into old patterns, seemingly happy with their situation. Caro doesn't want anything beyond the physical, and Max has inner wounds from the war that prevent him from getting to close to another person.<br />While the ending itself is predictable, the journey there is filled with adventure, danger, self-reflection and above all romance. Can Caro allow herself to feel more for Max than lust? Can Max overcome his fears of abandonment, long enough to realize he has fallen for Caro? Will they realize how much they need each other before it is too late?<br />\\"Master of Temptation\\" was a fun, sensual book that I had a hard time putting down. It is only marked 4 stars because as the reader you know how it will end up, and the formula doesn't differ from many other romances on the shelf. Nicole Jordan does an excellent job creating characters you can appreciate and sincerely want to follow their path, even if it is a well-worn one.	2004-04-27

Gods like Odin, Loki, Thor, Horace, Ibis etc. What happens when the civilization that worshipped them no longer exists, or no longer believes in them? What happens when the gods of old become antiquated and are replaced with the gods of today, gods of commerce, technology, and media? That is the premise of \\"American Gods\\" and yet the book is so much more than the encapsulated sentences. As immigrants came to America with their beliefs, the gods of old found America a horrible place to plant roots of spirituality. The spiritual meccas and shrines of today can be found in monuments such as Mount Rushmore.<br />So what happens if the gods of old decide to make a stand and force out the present gods?  Or is it truly a stand they want to make? And how did one ex-convict become so important to this approaching storm?<br />I found myself utterly compelled by this book. It was a novel that not only did I have a hard time putting down, but a hard time explaining. Part fiction, part fantasy, part religious treatise, \\"American Gods\\" is not an easily definable book, and for that I am glad.<br />This is the first book I have read by Neil Gaiman, and it will not be the last.	2004-04-23

I can still remember reading it as an 11 year old, and presenting a shoe box diorama of the showdown between Aerin and the Dragon in my reading class. While the strong feminist principles were not quite understood as an 11 year old, they are today. Even re-reading it now, you cheer for Aerin as she begins to understand her place in the world, and how what others say really doesn't matter. She longs to be more than the sum of her parts, and proves to be more than capable not only to herself, but to her father and the Damarians.<br />Great example of Robin McKinley's writing, that transcends age and sex, and is a worthy adventure/fantasy for everyone.	2004-04-17

While not spooky, the plot was at times trite, and the ending rushed and almost comic.<br />The main characters have become unwilling guinea pigs to an egocentric brilliant scientist. The \\"stuff\\" that he injects affects each person differently, and you best hope it is for the good. Fortunately for the sake of the novel, all 3 of the victims use their newfound powers to right wrongs before they can occur, and escape the bad men in dark Suburbans.<br />The conclusion that includes the confrontation of evil-scientist Proctor, and the formation of the \\"Moonlight Club\\" is almost a true comic book without the nifty illustrations. I've heard wonderful things about this author and am eager to try other books, but if this is your first time, or first time in awhile, this novel may not be the best pick of the litter.	2004-04-06

You can't help but enjoy a main character who has a Pinocchio clock in his office, loves spicy food, and has a sidekick with an empty office.<br />As another reviewer pointed out, this book is more of an &quot;action&quot; novel than it is mystery. There are no major plot twists that leave you in shock. There are no subtle clues at the beginning of the story you should pay attention to. You feel more that you are the listener to Elvis' outloud ramblings that help him in solving the case.<br />The book flows, and I found myself absorbed in the whip sharp dialogue and wondering how Cole can eat what he does while still remain healthy and on top of his game.	2004-03-19

My biggest point of concern over this series is the eventuality that the author will run out of ways to bring the counterparts together. \\"Dark  Melody\\" provides a new twist. Rather than concentrating on the evil menace of those who have embraced vampirism, the focus is on the couple themselves and how to overcome the physical ailments that Corinne has. Corinne, while psychic, has a very weak heart. It's tough enough to support her own system, but throw in a pregnancy and you have yourself a heady mix. It is heartwarming to see Dayan try to overcome his need to bond Corinne to him as his lifemate and still hold her best interests. In this case the bonding itself could destroy Corinne.<br />The one major weakness in this novel was a secondary character, Lisa. She is Corinne's best friend and sister-in-law. She is ultimately a weak, needy character that I had a hard time understanding. Her own selfishness causes pain to others and she doesn't appear to have learned her lesson by the end of the story. Instead her needy codependence is enabled by a marriage to Cullen. I can't even begin to imagine how she would deal with Corinne's change and inability to be with Lisa 24/7.	2004-03-10

The ending was anti-climatic. What is supposed to be a major setup for justice was fizzled out. The issue could have been addressed much earlier; instead of stringing along the reader. As the reader I anticipated much more to the face-off between Julian and Jaxx's stepfather and was bitterly disappointed.<br />My biggest irk was the domineering ways of Julian in &quot;converting&quot; Jaxx. For an incredibly independent and strong (both physically and mentally) woman, she capitulated rather easily. No major histronics or displays of anger. The character of Jaxx could have been done so much better. Instead it left me wanting more.<br />It must be tough for an author to continue to make the storylines fresh and interesting for the reader. How many ways can a Carpathian meet his lifemate and bond her? With this book it seems she has run out of the ways. Since I have gone this far in the series I have purchased the next one and hope it redeems it self. On the bright side it can't be much worse than this one.	2004-02-28

So Ned is sent to Victorian England for a little R&R only to find himself right in the biggest mystery of them all.<br />\\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" is a hard book to classify. Equal parts sci-fi, mystery and a little romance thrown in, you find yourself completely engrossed in the minutiae of England; as long as you can wrap your noodle around time travel, time lag, incontunity and self-corrections.<br />You'll love the characters from Mrs. Kindle (the lovely wet naid a very groggy Ned sees), Terrence, Tossie, Professor Peddick and more. Despite trying to correct history and the future, Ned manages to get a bit of sleep, despite sharing the bed with a kitty Princess Arjumand and bulldog Cyril; and manages the treasure dig at the jumble sale; and manages to get the girl.<br />This is truly a fun, quirky, unique novel sure to make you laugh and cheer.	2004-02-27

Thus far it has become my favorite. The reason for this is due in large part to Tempest. In the preceding books the idea of freedom of choice has become somewhat of a myth to the Carpathian men when it relates to potential lifemates. While the thought of taking what you want seems like a novel idea, when it pertains to a person it chafes. I genuinely enjoyed the chemistry between Darius and Tempest. I believed in her struggle to overcome the mental boundaries that prohibit her from entirely embracing a new lifestyle. Darius' reasoning on his potential mortality and Tempest's ultimate choice are what make this book a standout. If you are curious to find out what these choices are, I encourage you to pick up this book. It makes for a quick bedtime read	2004-01-30

Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy Amanda Quick's works, but this time I was left feeling so-so. The main character, Lavinia Lake is a woman on her own, determined to be utterly independent. I applaud an author who makes a female character who has her own mind, especially in a setting such as this, when the burgeoning dissatisfaction with traditional feminine roles is starting to show. Unfortunately this time through, Lavinia uttered her need for independence one to many times. Being browbeaten as a reader with this idea nearly every chapter takes it's toll.<br />With that huge venting aside the book was enjoyable. It is delightful to see Lavinia and Tobias' feelings deepen and mature as their partnership continues. I do look forward to the next book and hope that a balance can be found between independence and annoyance.	2003-12-11

Over the course of 20 years and numerous letters back and forth you discover the hidden personalities of each person involved--and how all become friends from a distance. Whether it is in the physical gifts of food and other rationed items that Helene sends to Marks &amp; Co, or the prayers that Frank and Nora's children send out to Helene in the hopes that finances will enable her to come out to England. I found myself heartbroken at the turn of events that befell Frank Doel, and made an inner promise to myself to seize the moment. I hope that all who chance upon this book will walk away with something as wonderful as I did.	2003-05-05

Sookie Stackhouse is a barmaid, telepath and girlfriend of Vampire Bill. Sookie finds herself in one jam after another. Who knew that being a cocktail waitress would be so much trouble? First her co-worker is found dead in the back of a police car, she is attacked by a maenid who uses Sookie as a messenger, and finally she has to assist the Dallas union of vampires in tracking down a missing vampire.<br />Sookie is described as &quot; a sweet little eclair on the outside, and a pit bull on the inside&quot;. You have to be when dealing with vampires, shape-shifters, fang-bangers and the Fellowship of the Sun.<br />Watch for the climatic end. All I have to say is when a telepath tells you to hit the floor, learn how to drop at lightning speed. I can hardly wait for the third novel to hit the shelves this summer.	2003-02-27

Anita Blake, an animator and \\"Executioner\\", finds herself unwillingly helping the sort of people (vampires) she consciously would not have chosen. Anita is now neck deep in ghouls, corpses, gris-gris and master vampires.  I always look forward to an author who has a female protagonist who is equal parts tough cookie and cream puff. Anita Blake can kick your [rear] faster than you can say...well [rear], and yet dangle a penguin in front of her and she is happy (Ms. Blake collects penguins). The only reason why I rated this book 4 stars is due to the rate in which Anita dispatched what is described as a \\"master vampire\\". I find it a bit of a stretch to imagine an immortal being, who is capable of stripping your mind, being distracted by two persons--and human at that. Despite that I genuinely enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more of the series.	2003-02-27

Telepathic, Sookie has never been able to embroil herself in relationships--how could she when she would know what is going on in her partners mind. So it is a wonderful relief when Vampire Bill walks into her bar. For once she can relax and unshield, be herself, for she cannot pick up anything from Bill.<br />Thus starts a unique relationship between Sookie and Bill Compton. Set in contemporary times, this novel proposes the what if; what if vampires are not only very real, but granted status as citizens and can mainstream into society? What sort of implications and backlash would that bring?<br />As newly minted citizens, the vampires are treated with equal parts disdain, fear, curiosity and outrage. Sookie and Bill attempt to make their relationship work, but it is pushed to the limits when the persons closest to Sookie find themselves in harm's way. Will Sookie and Bill be able to discover who is responsible for the grisly murders occuring, and prevent her brother from being named as suspect #1?	2003-02-27

How thankful I am that I got it. The protagonist, Devon March is a 14 yr old \\"average\\" kid with a few minor exceptions, primarily being the monsters and bogeyman we all fear in our closet and under the bed are real for Devon and have plagued him all his life. To his astonishment he finds his fathers words \\"you are stronger than all of them\\" to be true and can banish the demons back to where they came from. Unfortunately for Devon his life takes a seriously unexpected twist. His father passes away leaving him to wrestle with the fact that he wasn't his true father and leaves guardianship of him to a mysterious woman living in Misery Point, Rhode Island at Ravenscliff Manor. There he attempts to uncover the past to not only find out who he is, who his parents are, but what inevitably is his future. We encounter some wonderfully written characters that are not dumbed down for children's sake, nor are the adults completely incompetent. Devon, and his gang of misfits which include Cecily, his guardian's daughter; DJ, the older kid with a car; Ana the cheerleader; and Marcus the recently outed gay student, try to fight the plague of demons that befall them with some assistance by Rolfe, an entrepreneur with a shady past.<br />The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is due to the ending. What starts out as an incredibly climatic scene facing off Devon with the \\"Madman\\" is diffused very easily leaving me wanting more. Despite that I have the 2nd book on order here at Amazon.com and look forward to more.	2003-02-21

Having read &quot;Savage Love&quot; often, I was curious to hear Mr. Savage's uptake on the 'virtuecrats'. Although I myself don't choose many of the habits that were mentioned in the book, my choice in lifestyle or past events would be cause for alarm by the Dr. Laura's and yet how does that hurt anyone? That was the point I truly appreciated in this book. Persons who choose the sins that are bringing America to the wasteland the virtuecrats feel it is, don't push them on others, and yet the majority of America has to sit idly by as we are told how to live, what to do in our personal lives.<br />My only cause for concern is the &quot;he says, she says&quot; attitude. If Robert Bork says one thing, Mr. Savage countered with its anti-thesis but didn't provide an alternative.<br />I did take to heart one thing I hope to implement in my personal life and that is to be active in voicing my opinion. The opinions I hear on a daily basis are certainly not ones that I either solicit or agree to. Those who want radical changes have to be the ones to set the wheel in motion and I plan on being behind the wheel and give it a push!	2003-01-23

So I was incredibly delighted to find the NJO series that had me completely hooked. This book in particular. Rather than a lightsaber fighting-fest against the Vong, it was an internal struggle for Jacen to fight beyond the boundaries of his conventional thinking. It reminded me of the scene in the \\"Matrix\\" where Neo is in awe about a child bending a spoon when he is reminded that there literally \\"is no spoon\\". That is the sort of thing Jacen has to bend his mind around. Is there a good and dark Force? Or is it all good since it can all have Force? Is it only bad based on our motivation for using it? These questions and more weigh on Jacen's mind as he and Vergere engage in the most intense apprentice training of all time.	2003-01-22

It was a delightful book combining elements from multiple fairy tales (Sleeping Beauty, Princess and the Pea, and Rumplestiltskin to name a few). I genuinely enjoyed the concept of a female protagonist that was not interested in the \\"princessiness\\" of life and wanted more. To that extent I wished the author had fleshed out Vevila to a greater degree. This book has such great potential. Perhaps Rebecca Lickiss will take a cue from many directors who are \\"re-tooling\\" their movies, and take a moment to retool this. I for one would buy it again with add-ons.	2002-09-15
US	51214015	R3T81SKP6942PF	0743418174	780559593	Good in Bed	Books	4	3	3	N	N	An enjoyable fluffy read	I did like this book. I enjoyed an unconventional main character (an overweight sarcastic women), who had a grip on life and reality. She was flawed, but aren't we all. The hardest stretch as a reader was reconciling that an everyday person could run into a celebrity in the bathroom, bond over love lost and magically have them become your fairy godmother, whisking you away to places you never would have normally gone, and how her life is altered by this person who can flit in and rearrange apartments with the touch of her money.<br />With that aside I liked this book. It was a plot that I, and possibly many can relate to, getting back to life after a breakup. In addition Jennifer Weiner brings to the foreground a weighty issue, that of obesity. The fact that her main character is not a size 0 who eats celery all day long, but was real and human and stayed up late crying in her ice cream and worried about the sounds her pants made when she walked, made me want to meet this person, have coffee with her and get to know her. I encourage you to read this book. It is a perfect book to sit at the beach with, or better yet snuggle up on the couch with a blanket and a cup of cocoa and just have fun.	2002-08-22

I appreciated how the character wasn't a complete idiot who thought to herself that a man would truly complete her. She knew who she was, had made a name for herself, had great friends and a witty repartee. Give me a saucy gal who can speak her mind against any man, and I'll be reading your books!!	2002-08-22

I genuinely enjoyed the concept, two people vetoing the commercialism, opting instead to enjoy a holiday vacation. Great idea right? Wrong. I found that the characters suffered from a lack of spine. Why would anyone hide behind curtains and doors to escape from carolers? Escaping to the basement to avoid yet another round of neighbors persons trying to get donations, when a simple no would suffice. The final straw for me was when Carol, the main characters wife, forgoes all her plans to appease a daughter who is quickly flying back to the states after a month. Discussing this among my friends we agreed unanimously that we would have told the daughter to enjoy her stay in the house, we are going on a cruise. Sorry Mr. Grisham. I've enjoyed many of your books, and will continue to look for your titles, but can't in good faith put this on my shelf. I will be skipping this title for Christmas.	2001-12-16
