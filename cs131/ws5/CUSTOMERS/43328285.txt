It is my son's all time favorite. Be prepared to stumble through it the first time you read it and find yourself trying to explain some new vocabulary words. This book is great. The little boy goes to the store to purchase some red sneakers, dispite the many colors that are in the store the red sneakers are sold out. The little boy explains to the store clerk all the wonderful things a pair of red sneakers can do. From mega- speed packs, little fans to cool your toes, sunctions cups, and parachutes. Great imagination, nice illustrations, The little boy leaves with a pair of blue rocket sandals. This is a little more difficult book to read to a group of preschoolers, but a great book one on one, or a great book to read to a group of 5 to 8 year olds.  <br /> <br />	2005-08-30

Went Another Balloon: A Magical Counting Storybook (Magical Counting Storybooks)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Great counting book, plus.....	hey I expected this to be just another counting book, but my 3 and 4 year olds loved this book so much. We borrowed it from the library. As you turn each page 10 different colored balloons are popped one by one by very pesky birds. As each page is turned Toby the turtle tries a different form of transportation to speed away from the \\"Pesky birds\\". Toby is determined to get some balloons over to Tina for her birthday. Each ballon a different color, each set of pages with a new number of balloons to count. Also, each page has different critters across the bottom of the page to talk about. Toby starts out walking, but ends up in a rocket ship to get one red balloon to his friend Tina for her birthday. Very nice book. Nice thick pages. Very colorful.	2005-05-24

When I first sat down and starting reading this book, I was disappointed and then I kept reading and then i read it to my 3 year old son and he has asked to read it every night for the past  month. Be prepared to explain a few new words and concepts. And be a little or a lot grossed out. But this book is not boring and has lots to talk about. My favorite part is the, \\" Baby diaper skunks.\\" I think my son has lots of favorites, he likes the skunk mobile with Hyper windsheild-wiper skunks. He also like the part were it says, \\" It's okay to spray the dresser drawer where your sister keeps her Pajamily.\\" Pajamily is a made up word to rhyme with Family. Lots of imagination and vocabulary in the book. Lots of fun things in the book for girls, also.	2005-04-26

Smiley shark is a great book for learning about the ocean or talking about teeth or just having fun reading. The story line is simple. All the creatures are scared of Smiley Shark until one day he saves them from a fisherman's net and they all become his friend. the Story is wrote very nicely and the art work is wonderful.  I have read this book several time to the children and they often will ask to read it again. Another great book is \\"Shark Trouble,\\" About two monkeys trapped on small seperate islands with sharks swimming around the islands. All the kids love the shark books.	2005-02-18

They talked and talked about the book. They all had a favorite page. One like the Slimy swamp monster and another child like the hairy ape. but Everyone agreed that it was really special that the mommy in the story loved her child no matter what. They all understood the message of unconditional love. We have read this book many times. A Great mother's day present or Valentine day gift.  Great art work.  <br />I haven't read the other books in this series, but a teacher told me that they are all great. <br /> <br />	2005-02-18

I have a paperback from Scholastic magazine, but I feel the hardcover book is well worth the price as the naughty monkeys get into all sorts of trouble. Several of the naughty monkeys do things that my son has gotten into trouble for, like cutting his hair and drawing on the walls. Great for letter recognition, and beginning letter sound. Each monkey has a name that begins with the letter sound and each monkey gets into trouble also reinforcing the letter sound. My son likes all the naughty monkeys, but one of his favorites is Robin. \\"Naughty little Monkey, Tracking up the rug. Her feet are very muddy from some holes that she has dug.\\" Robin is carrying in a shovel full of dirt and you can see out the open door that she has dug holes in the yard and she has muddy foot prints all over. Very funny and very good art work. <br />	2005-02-18

In this book, santa wakes up late, trips and falls over his pants, can't find the reindeer in the woods, gets hit by a snowball by the reindeer, who are having a snow ball fight, crashes his sled that becomes stuck and then is rescued by a large beautiful horse on the farm while a rooster shouts out encouragement.

He imagines he is a bat hanging in a cave, an otter floating on a pond, a polar bear in a cave, ect. With each animal there is a wonderful illustration with the little mouse sleeping with that animal family. Very nice. And with each animal family the little mouse decides that it wont work for him. His feet would get tired, if he had to hang upside down like a bat, He would get lonely and miss his family if he was a polar bear sleeping all winter. The book ends with the little mouse falling asleep in his grass nest with his mother by his side.	2004-10-05

Infact if it had been the first one I had read, I am not so sure I would have kept reading the rest.   I know an old Lady Who Swallowed a Bat, is one of our favorites. along with the original.   This one just doesn't flow well for me and the kids just didn't seem as interest. Perhaps the age group was too young, 3 and 4 year olds, maybe 5 to 7 year olds would enjoy it more.   The order is Dry pie, cider, roll, squash, salad, turkey, pot, cake, (ten-layer cake), bread, the ending ends up with her saying, \\"Happy Thanksgiving,\\" and being floated in a parade as a big giant balloon.  She gets fatter as she eats each item.   the pictures don't do a whole lot for me either in this book.  Just not my favorite.	2004-09-08

Want to teach your preschooler more about the world. This book is great for an ocean theme unit and an alphabet unit. I have a home daycare with lots of 2 to 4 year olds and this is a favorite book. Now I don't think you are going to get your 18 month old too interested, but I find the preschoolers love the challenge of learning more about the world. I haven't tried any of Jerry Pallotta's other books, but I am planning on adding some more to my home library. Don't let your preschooler think that all things swimming in water are just called fish. Help them improve their vocabulary with this great ocean book. \\"A is for Alphabet Book. A is also for the Atlantic Ocean. The fish and other creatures in this book live in the North Atlantic Ocean.B is for Bluefish. Everyone loves to catch Bluefish because they love to fight.

I enjoy surfing the net looking for great activities and songs to do with my little ones at my day care.  But My sister gave me this book and I am using a lot of the ideas in it. I am going to purchase the book on Spring themes. This book covers several themes during the winter month. From Mice, toys, mittens, snow, hands, feet, cocoa, circles, rectangles, night and day. There are creative, easy songs and finger plays to go with the themes and craft and snack ideas. For the snow theme it suggest putting glue into bowels, providing a large peice of blue paper and white cotton balls and having the kids dip the cotton balls in the glue and sticking them on the paper then there are three songs and three more ideas. followed by a theme on ice and then sledding all together there is close to 60 themes for December, January and February.Each them is covered on two pages. Including Ground hog day, Valentine day and taking care of your body. Very well done for 18 months and up. I think even babies would enjoy the songs and ideas.	2003-12-09
