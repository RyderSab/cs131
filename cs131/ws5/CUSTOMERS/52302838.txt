It's clearly the kind of thing to make a Finnish person's heart swell with pride, and is slanted greatly towards the side of the Finns; we learn very little about the Russians circa 1939/1940, although presumably all the Russian sources had to toe the party line (we learn a bit about Tsarist Russia, however, as many of the Finnish seniors officers have been trained by the Russian imperial army!). And of course it is very hard to feel sympathy towards a nation which we felt ambivalent about at the time, which would swiftly become our greatest ally, and swiftly thereafter our greatest enemy again. William Trotter seems to be something of a Fin-o-phile, and there is a photograph in the book of him standing by a wrecked bunker on the Mannerheim Line, in 1964. <br /> <br />Nonetheless this is a cracking read, fast-paced as well. As with Julian Jackon's 'The Fall of France' - which deals in similar depth with an almost exactly converse situation, which took place only a few months later - Trotter cuts to the chase quite rapidly, and gives a good sense of the personalities involved and the issues at stake. Finland is tall and thin, but its only worthwhile terrain is in the south, which is easiest to defend. Carl Gustav Mannerheim - a man so hard, they named an anti-tank rifle after him - is painted as a rock-solid figure of a kind which could be controversial in peacetime (he had no truck with revolutionary politics), but who was invaluable when the chips were down. There are no Soviet personalities, but that seems fitting for a political system that was supposed to be personality-free. <br /> <br />And the chips were very much down. The Soviet Union's army dwarfed that of Finland, indeed the total armed strength it committed to the attack was a quarter the size of Finland's entire population. After pretending that the Finns had attacked Leningrad, the Soviets poured over the border in great force, with overwhelming armour and artillery, and won. But it took them three months to cross roughly a hundred miles of Finland, and a quarter of a million dead. Even then, Finland was not conquered. Trotter's book devotes a few pages to the unfortunate 'Continuation War', which saw Finland fight against the Russians on the side of the Nazis, after which they flip-flopped and kicked the Nazis out, losing everything they had gained (Finland's borders today are those it retained in 1940). <br /> <br />Several elements of the fighting have entered legend; the 'Molotov cocktails' used against ponderous Russian tanks, the ski assaults, the Wild West wagon train-esque 'mottis', the 'sisu', the mental image of great numbers of Russian infantrymen struggling through snow. It was essentially a huge learning experience for the Russian army, and although they continued they continued their 'human wave' attacks against the later Nazi invasion, they had better tanks and knew how to use them. Although the Finns lacked anti-tank weapons, the Russians lacked tank nous, and paid heavily. <br /> <br />At 265 rapid pages the book shoots along and has the distinction of being the most modern of the two 'Winter War' books out there (confusingly, 'A Frozen Hell' is called 'The Winter War' in Europe). It makes excellent bedtime reading, because there's nothing more relaxing that reading about people who are much worse off than yourself; the Winter War was truly a desperate affair, and I feel slightly embarassed for the utterly cynical way that Britian and France vaccilated about sending equipment and ammunition, and Sweden's - probably wise - unwillingless to allow transit of supplies across its territories.	2004-12-20

It divides up into three distinct battlefields - Oman, the Falklands the the Gulf, with the meat of the book taking place in the latter area. The first two sections are fairly run-of-the-mill, although it's interesting to compare the Falklands section with Max Hastings' 'Battle for the Falklands' and the aforementioned 'CQB', as one particular moment - in which an SAS soldier shoots down an Argentine aircraft with a Stinger - pops up in all three books, each from a slightly different perspective.<BR>It's the coverage of the Gulf war that's particularly interesting, though, as Ratcliffe took part in an SAS operation that's been gone over comprehensively in other books, books which he has read. Consequently, like some real-life 'Rashomon', he points out the exaggerations and untruths in 'Bravo Two Zero', 'Sabre Squadron' and others, all books which you can find elsewhere on Amazon.com. Whilst he seems slightly petulant at times (his account of leading a patrol gives the impression that he was blissfully unaware that he might come across as being, well, smug), it makes for fascinating reading...	2002-05-08

The book compiles some of the pictures shown during the exhibition, including some of the clever multi-image panoramas which worked much better when they were five feet wide. As some reviewers have mentioned, there are a couple of interlopers from the Gemini missions, and the selection of pictures gets a bit monotonous during the middle section - the bit of the moon, ironically enough. Whilst many of the shots of mountains and craters are astonishing, a lot of the time the moon looks like a floodlit quarry at night, and if it wasn't the moon - the moon, for heaven's sake - many of the pictures wouldn't be of interest (compared to the landscape photography of Ansel Adams, for example). My only other criticism is that the combination of high-quality paper and black ink makes fingerprints show up as indelible greasy smudges, and you'll probably want to read the book with gloves (I'm not joking).<br />The rest is essentially as outlined elsewhere on this page; breathtaking images of the lunar landscape, and some interesting, rarely-seen shots of exhausted astronauts covered in stubble and lunar dust. And there's one striking shot of a photograph of one astronaut's family, dropped on the moon's surface - striking because it's the only spot of colour on a black-and-white planet. In the end that's what you'll remember; the lack of colour. Earth is indescribably beautiful.	2002-03-12

'The Martian Chronicles' collects most of them together in one book (missing out 'I, Mars', in which the last man on Mars automates a town in order to combat loneliness, and 'Dark they were, and Golden Eyed') arranged so as to form a loose story which, in typical Bradbury style, is actually about America, and not Mars at all. Bradbury is a writer first and a sci-fi writer second, and if you're expecting endless descriptions of nuclear propulsion you probably won't like this book. Because of this, it's one of the few sci-fi books from the period that hasn't dated. It's also one of the ultimate downers, but in a good way - the general tone is one of loneliness and despair, without being doomy. It's a shame that, judging by the lack of reviews, this book is so obscure nowadays, especially compared to his contemporaries Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, neither of whom have aged as well.	2001-07-16

And secondly, it doesn't use the letter 'e'. There's an English translation called 'A Void' which also does not use an 'e'. As a novel to read and own it's completely pointless - there is a plot, and characters, but the constraint of not using the most popular letter of the alphabet means that nothing of interesting happens. As a curiousity to flick through, it's much better, although it's unlikely you would want to actually read it all the way through (unless you're trying to show off).	2001-07-09
US	52302838	R2QBPMXUXJ1SH1	0393301982	376038690	The Battle for the Falklands	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Anomaly	I was six and a bit when the war began and ended, and I only have patchy memories of the period. I can remember Moira Stewart constantly calling it 'The Falklands Crisis' on the news, and I can remember news footage of grey ships sitting in a sunlit harbour, and Simon Weston, the badly-burned survivor of the 'Galahad', who went on to be something of a mini-celebrity. And, for that matter, Adrian Mole's dad leaping out of bed on learning that the islands had been invaded, as he believed that they were off the coast of Scotland. But that's about it. Nobody ever played Falklands War games at school and although Action Men (GI Joe figures, if you're American) were still popular, they always fought the Germans, not the 'Argies'. I think that more people in Britain genuinely hated the Argentines because of Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal than for the Falklands. For a long time computer games featured Harriers and Exocets, but after a few years the whole affair faded away, with the occasional media spurt - 'Tumbledown', for one - to keep it distantly in the imagination. As such, it's nice that this book is still in print. Originally released in 1983, it was reissued in 1997 (with a new foreword, although the content is still the same). It alternates between presenting a view of the conflict on the ground, and a view of the conflict in Whitehall - the former bits are engaging, whilst the latter are very dry and a little dull. That - and the fact that there isn't even a mention of the Sun's infamous 'Gotcha' headline - is the only real drawback, as I see it, as the history presented here seems definitive (of course, I wasn't there, so I have no way of knowing how definitive. But it rings true). I was surprised to learn that there were essentially only two land battles - Goose Green and the extended series of fights around Stanley - and I was also surprised at how passive the Argentines seemed. The Argentine Air Force seemed to be hammering the British Navy to start with, but then seemed to give up - the book explains that this was due to attrition, but that doesn't seem right. There are some useful illustrations, maps and so forth, and the photographs in the middle are poignant - lots of ramrod straight military men, some of them looking as if they had stepped straight from Rorke's Drift, some of them dead. As it was published in 1983, the only serious downside is that there isn't much from the Argentine point-of-view. By all accounts it seems as if the Argentines could have prolonged the battle for months, but they chose not to - political pressures at home, or psychological defeat? It's odd to see James Callaghan's name, not once, but several times.	2001-06-18

Michael Rogin's guide to 'Independence Day' is not like that, however. It's ever so slightly mad. Presumably annoyed at having to write about such a shallow flim, Rogin piles on layers of Freudian analysis to such a degree that 'ID4' ceases to be a jingoistic action film, and becomes a dark view of contemporary sexual politics. In particular, Randy Quaid's vengeful, drunken airman is on a quest to regain his masculinity after violation at the hands of the aliens (whose 'mothership' is explicitly female, and against which he exacts revenge with a symbolically 'unnatural' penetration at the climax of the film), whilst Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith are acting out a drama of black / jewish unity with symbolically erect cigars. I'm not joking. It's either deeply misguided or a work of genius, and well worth buying.	2001-05-24

I thought that, although it looks superb and is no doubt a festival of continuity for long-standing comic fans, it over-egged the pudding to such a degree that the little things - a gripping story, characters that you can care about - are pushed into the background. It's like a series of stunning oil paintings one after the other with a tenuous story that seems a bit like 'Batman : The Dark Knight Returns'. It seems to have uniformly five-star reviews here, but I haven't read it again since I bought it, and that was some time ago.	2001-05-23

It's not at all a 'diary', or particularly candid or real, as the author admits that the photographs are posed (with the encouragement of Eric Kroll), and that they do not portray actual situations. There's lots of dated-sounding text that breathlessly uses words such as 'downloading' and 'logging-in', as if they were extraordinarily cool, and although it's not quite as bad as anything by David Hamilton, it's essentially a glorified 'Penthouse' shoot, or an Eric Kroll book but with a digital camera. As for the digital nature of the photographs, so what? A camera's a camera.	2001-05-11

You can read it, and see how people thought things might have been, way back in 1998, a time when it looked as if 'the suits' were on the verge of being replaced by a new breed of business, and a new breed of businessperson. As one of the reviewers above says, &quot;In a turn of events that will send shudders of terror through corporate America, most of the business-as-usual ways of thinking, acting, and talking, of the last century prove absolutely toxic to the would-be successful corporation doing business in this new medium.&quot; Except that the 'would-be successful corporations' are going to the wall at a rate of knots, and the 'business-as-usual' ways i.e. making a profit by selling stuff, turned out to be right after all. As for the 'markets as conversaions' model, does anybody actually relish going to the local used car emporium so that they can talk to the sales staff? People simply don't want to talk to Amazon.com as if it was a great friend, they just want to buy books with the minimum of fuss and effort. The future? People at home using digital television to access a handful of hand-picked shopping sites, with no access to, or desire to access, the old-fashioned internet.	2001-05-10

The author has clearly put a lot of effort into it, and a lot of people like it, but I find it to be one of those things that I can respect, without necessarily liking it very much. Don't get me wrong - it's big and detailed, and treats Elvis respectfully, as a human being - but it's very slow. Reading about one of the most vibrant times in modern history seemed dull, as the author concentrates exclusively on Elvis alone, with very little about the changing times around him. We are told that his singles sell over a million copies in three weeks, but we are not told whether this is a monumental achievement, or merely good, or whether this is unique or not; other emerging rock musicians are only mentioned in passing, as indeed is rock music in general; there are lots of dull descriptions of Elvis going out to restaurants or on holiday or to the beach, and then coming back again; facts and names and dates seem to blur together, and he doesn't attribute a lot of quotes; but in the end it's the lack of context that gets to me. And it's very clinical - although we learn a lot about the details of recording sessions, the songs themselves, songs which have since become standards, are barely mentioned. Despite all this, I can appreciate that it's still a great book, it just left me cold.	2001-04-25

At this price it's restricted to people who absolutely need it, although along with 'Godel, Escher, Bach' it's one of the seminal hackish coffee-table books.	2001-03-14

Which is odd at first - everything is in the present tense, and there's nothing about the cultural impact of the show because that was all in the future. Doubly odd is the fact that all of the many quotes from Gene Roddenberry are reported IN BLOCK CAPITALS, giving the bizarre impression that he is not a television producer, but God Himself.<br />It's extremely detailed, and is as much about the making of any TV late-60s series as it is 'Star Trek'. There are bits from shooting scripts, set plans, photographs of noted theatre actor William Shatner in old-age makeup (looking nothing like he looks in genuine old age), profiles of production staff, and programme budgets which, translated dollar-for-dollar, would just about cover the catering bill on 'Star Trek : The Next Generation'. It's worth it for the stream of memos about Vulcan names alone.	2001-01-23

But it's not perfect. After reading it for a while, flicking through entries, you find an odd, date-related malaise. Titles from before 1960 tend to garner quite favourable reviews. Titles after 1992, when Halliwell himself died, also tend to gather quite favourable reviews, or at least reviews that don't disagree with your own perspective too much. The problem is that Halliwell seemed to detest films made from the 60s onwards. Action and sci-fi films get particularly short shrift - the four-star 'Alien', for example, originally had just one star, purely for technical effort. Thankfully the book has been reworked and edited, although if you're reading this there isn't anything here than the IMDB doesn't offer, as the writing style is extremely sparce and you have no way of cross-referencing anything.	2001-01-18

As such, your enjoyment of this is going to depend on your opinion of Clarke's novel (which, without the film, would probably be out-of-print too), and whether you want to read disjointed chapters from early drafts. As glimpses into an alternative '2001', one that Kubrick might have filmed, it's priceless; as entertainment, it's less interesting. Like the other 'hard sci-fi' writers, Clarke is best at the science bits, and a short segment from an alternative finale, one in which the four surviving Discovery crewmembers explore a deep hole in the side of Iapetus (although, oddly, it's only referred to as 'Jupiter V' - perhaps they hadn't named it yet), is fascinating. The talky bits were never his strong point, though, and the pre-flight glimpses at Earth in the year 2001 are full of people not so much conversing, as delivering little scientific monologues at each other. As with everything else Clarke has written, none of the characters have any actual character - although it's possible that this is hyper-realism as, let's face it, most people in the real world are bland, dull and interchangeable, especially when they're at work, and Clarke's characters are always at work. Disappointingly, HAL doesn't appear at all. The other main strand personifies the monolith in the form of Clindar, a tall, noble alien who comes across as an insufferably self-righteous riff on Klaatu from 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'. One shudders to think how camp the film would have been if this had been filmed. And there are a couple of descriptions of alien landscapes and societies which are quite evocative but have a habit of repeating themselves.<br />There's a reprint of 'The Sentinel' as well, but if you're going to the trouble of ordering this from Amazon (it took about a month for them to find and post it to sodden, freezing, miserable London, which wasn't much slower than a normal order) you've probably read that already. In summary, then, if you're reading this you're either buzzing with curiosity or you're me, and if you're a fan of the film, the book, or Clarke it's essential. You'll probably buy it, read it once, and never read it again, though.	2001-01-10

Playboy of the month for June, 1997, Carrie Stevens had distinctive flame-red hair and firm, natural breasts. However, in the three years since then, she appears to have gone downhill in the looks department, and moved to an alternative career as a fisherwoman. This is quite odd, as Playmates usually attempt a career in acting or, in the modern era, as 'goddesses of the web'. Carrie's decision to take such a drastic career move is surely evidence of a strong personality, one which separates her from the traditionally airheaded view of Playmates. Nice one, Carrie!	2000-12-14

The revelation that George was once married and led a relatively normal family life does nothing to dispel the suspicion that the pair remove their suits over the weekend and retire to the countryside anonymously. Certainly, the appear to have spent most of the 1970s being drunken party animals. It's amusing to listen to lots of critics initially finding them amusing, then alarming, then deeply moving, then warm and lovable, according to critical fashion. As with their art, the book has a melancholic air to it, as the author sadly passed away shortly before completion (the book stops rather abruptly and is finished with some travelogue essays on their exhibitions abroad). The closing observation by the pair that Farson did not realise how much they liked him is deeply sad. It's big and thick and well-written, and there is a nice selection of photographs.

A hyper-detailed account of an extended gunfight in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, it drops the reader into a well-planned, well-intentioned military intervention that, through an accumulation of chaotic details, degenerates into a confused mess. After two helicopters are shot down, and three others badly-damaged, a mixture of Rangers and Delta Force are shuffled inelegantly through a hail of gunfire, in a city where every building looks the same, by a command and communication hierarchy that is unable to react fast enough to cope with the changing situation. Although technically a success, the 15-hour battle saw the deaths of over 500 assorted US and Somali people, with over a thousand wounded, many for life. Bowden's book pulls this over you and doesn't let forget that, without vehicles and night-vision, all men with guns are more or less equal. Well-drawn maps detail the confusion as a bullet-ridden rescue convoy is led through the city, creating more casualties than it would have prevented, and thankful Bowden has also interviewed surviving Somalis, both civilians and gunmen. Whilst Somalia comes across as anarchy, there aren't really any villains - the US troops are well-meaning but overrun, and the Somalis were understandably enraged at the sight of armoured soldiers kidnapping local heroes.<br />Although there is a great deal of political background, the meat of the book transcends that - it's about people hiding behind cars and rocks, people shooting at shadows and being shot in turn, people being killed at different speeds. The cumulative effect is numbing, and the growing death toll seems less shocking than it should be, as reserve gives way to shots at anything that moves. It would make a great film, too, in another universe - I shudder at the thought of Jerry 'Armageddon' Bruckheimer producing this.	2000-10-02

It's a selection of ten years' worth of the most melancholic main-stream comic-strip of the late-80's / early-90's, but better than that  it's a 'making of', too. Think of it as a big DVD collection with lots of  extra bits and you're there. Almost every page has a little fact about the  making of the strip, and although it's doesn't cover the entirely history  of the strip (which, by the time this book was released, had finished) it's  both a great introduction to the characters, and a fascinating set of  trivia. The essays in the front of the book let us peek into the mind of  Bill Watterson as he pontificates on the decline of the comic strip, and  his attitude towards selling out - he took his art very seriously, he was a  superb illustrator and he had the good taste to quit before the strip grew  stale.

Surprisingly hard to come by nowadays, this novel was written in parallel  with the fantastic film (in a similar way to '2001: A Space Odyssey', but  with much more action). It makes an interesting companion-piece  - there  are some subtle differences in detail and tone, and whilst the book has  plenty of action the destruction isn't quite so over-the-top. Best of all,  you can pour over the famously-tortuous plot at your leisure, without  having to pause and write down a little flowchart showing who is pretending  to be who. On the downside, you don't get the fantastic soundtrack, or  Clint Eastwood's mildly-peeved grimaces as bullets zing around his head.  Although he will forever be associated with 'Eagles', MacLean was more of a  cold war thriller writer than a war-thriller writer, and the book is an odd  cross between straightforward WW2 action and a John Le Carre-esque spy  thriller, meaning that the book is doubly dated, but still great fun.	2000-09-15

It's a masterful account of a  year in the life of the Baltimore homicide division, and is packed with  enough policework to fuel a dozen films and television series. It's never  sensationalist, and throughout the course of the year we get to know the  people who spend their lives running around in the dark - lots of little  images stick with you, like the officers who go to crime scenes with 'Theme  from Shaft' blaring on a portable cassette deck, or the frazzled officers  who shout at corpses in a forlorn attempt to gain information from them, or  the sweat-sodden shirts of the furnace-like night shift. Some crimes are  solved, some crimes are not, and at the end you start to wonder why the  policemen do the job they do, given that it entails lifting rotting bodies,  and involves constant exposure to the worst things in the world without  much financial recompense. You wonder why they don't just throw up their  hands and give up - if the injustice doesn't get you, the office politics  will. It gives a very good impression of the mind-numbing repetition of the  job, without being at all boring. Throughout, Baltimore comes across as the  futuristic Detroit from 'Robocop', and one can only imagine what a similar  book set in Los Angeles would be like. Simon followed this up with 'The  Corner', which trod a similar path but without being focused on the police.	2000-09-14

Although it's the kind of thing you buy  expecting it to be kitsch it's actually deeply affecting - taken at a time  when Britain was rebuilding itself after WWII, and 'Dan Dare' from 'Eagle'  proposed a future in which Britain ruled space, the concrete buildings,  motorways and civic centres are almost heartbreakingly sad nowadays - the  equivalent of the bull ring market in Birmingham. If this book was an  object it would be one of those tomato-shaped squeezy ketchup dispensers,  or a faded yellow plastic school chair.	2000-09-14

Whilst the spacemen  work in zero-g through the day and night, the Russian mission controllers  constantly deride their cosmonauts for being 'lazy', and NASA comes across  as a snobbish beaurocracy driven by tyrants. Some of the petty divisional  infighting would be hilarious in another situation - the collision with a  supply module that crippled Mir was caused, not by incompetence, but by the  withholding of vital equipment by RSC Energia, a corporation owed money by  the Russian government. Throughout, the Russian space program appears to be  enthusiastic but short of cash, whilst NASA seems at a loose end.  Technically, the book paints a vivid picture of space exploration that owes  more to 'Das Boot' than '2001'. It's perversely hopeful, though - the  trials of Mir have helped bring space exploration to a more  humanly-understandable level, and the days when spacemen were gods are now  in the past.	2000-09-07

For somebody from the UK, it's like a  glimse into a bizarre alternative world of Pet Rocks, Farrah Fawcett's hair  and the not-at-all drugs-related H. R. Pufnstuff. Did people once vote for  Jimmy Carter? Apparently so. It's written in an engagingly everyday tone by  the staff and freinds of a sadly-defunct magazine called 'Ben is Dead', and  the only bad thing is that it isn't ten times the size - it's great to read  on the train, and my copy is now creased and tatty.	2000-09-04

Featuring a  hero who is more resourceful than McGuyver, the books spanned the 60's and  70's before being revived quite recently with 'The Stainless Steel Rat goes  to Hell'. 'For President' and 'Saves the World' were the high spots - the  series eventually met with dimishing returns, and started to repeat itself.  The original 'Stainless Steel Rat' was a short story - after repeating it  in mildly-edited form as a 'prologue', the book follows our hero (James  Bolivar DiGriz, aka Slippery Jim, aka the Stainless Steel Rat) through a  short adventure through space in pursuit of a stolen battleship. With the  first part of the book given over to an introduction of the main character,  it seems more rushed than the later books (many of which are, annoyingly,  out-of-print). It's less obviously comedic, too, and the vision of the  future is sketched with enough vagueness that it hasn't dated too badly,  either.	2000-09-04

Rather than being simply a collection of reviews from the other,  hard-to-find Keyfax book, the whole book has been written from scratch.  Julian Colbeck has a knack for writing that is informative and friendly  without appearing smug, and the constant references to hopelessly untrendy  bands that he has worked with add to the charm. His selection of 100 great  synths covers the obvious bases and includes plenty of bizarre, interesting  things that you have probably never heard of - the Gleeman Pentaphonic and  the Octave-Plateau Voyetra Eight are new to me. Omissions are a matter of  taste, but it seems odd to have both the Jupiter 8 and MKS-80 in separate  entries, and it would have been nice to see the JX-10 as well. There is  single black-and-white photograph for each synth (oddly, the one for the  Kurzweil 250 seems to focus on the back of the machine), and a few  interesting images in the directory. Given that the synth market has thrown  up some interesting things in the last four years, here's hoping that  there's an updated reprint in the wings, hopefully with a CD of old synth  sounds attached to the front.	2000-09-04
US	52302838	R3R3EAJI8D1Q39	0385486847	463740668	Infinite Loop	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Vicious	Against it, it's way too long, spends a lot of time reiterating itself,  and it's obvious that the author absolutely hates Steve Jobs, but on the  other hand it's a rare history of Apple that isn't too blinded by love for  the company's machines to notice that the company itself has been in bad  shape ever since the Apple III. Both a rant about the awfulness of Jobs,  and an engaging history of the company right up until the launch of the  iMac, this is written from the point of view of somebody who once believed  in the idea of Apple, until realising that there isn't one, really. It's  quite a sad tale, too - the Apple of the 90's was its own worst enemy,  hiring and firing CEOs with abandon and reorganising every six months,  whilst churning out dull-looking white boxes which had neither the charm  nor the power / price ratio of Apple's past and current line-up. The Apple  of the 80's was misguided, too (the Apple 2, the company's cash-cow, was  derided by Jobs and the team ostracised by the company), but can be  forgiven simply for producing the most engaging user interface for a home  computer. It's nice to see Steve Wozniak play a part - the standard Apple  corporate history (for an example, see 'Appledesign') usually writes him  out of the story during the creation of the Apple 2. Whether you like this  book depends on whether your view of Apple - at the extremes of love and  hate you'll either want to burn the book or ignore it, and in the  middle-ground of distant admiration / distaste you'll find that the author  is often as manipulative as the Steve Jobs presented within the text (he  constantly uses hindsight to make the players appear ignorant). There are a  couple of dodgy mistakes, too - mostly typos, but off-putting nonetheless -  and the author has a habit of telling you something at the end of a  section, and then telling you the same thing a paragraph later, as if he  was desperate to pour the words out as quickly as possible. After a wobbly,  petulant start it gets going, though, and the biggest drawback is a  complete lack of illustrations - to this day, I still do not know what  Michael Spindler looked like (something I share, it would appear, with many  Apple employees).	2000-09-01

His ability to tell a rattling good  tale balance out his deficiencies as a writer, and although elements of his  books seem to be closer to 'JAG' than 'Red Storm Rising', they are at the  very least extremely entertaining. 'Storming Heaven' is a good example. It  has a hissable villain, a cast of fighter-jet pilots who appear to have  stepped from 'Top Gun', and a series of explosive, airliner-related  disasters which have the sick fascination of a car crash. Loosely-connected  to some of his other books (particularly 'Chains of Command'), this falls  apart on any intellectual level, and the continual calls for tighter  airport security seem to be Oprah Winfrey-style 'talking points' for  television interviews, but provided that you don't expect high art, it's  exciting reading.	2000-08-24

It feels like an in-house corporate history that has been expanded into a coffee table book. The bulk of it consists of photographs of Apple's products, preproduction models, and design ideas, and there is a lengthy and very dry written history of Apple's design work. The book does not deal with the technical makeup of Apple's computers, it is solely about the boxes they came in.    Although this sounds very simple, the end result falls short. The photographs and text concentrate heavily on design concepts from the mid to late 1980s, almost to the exclusion of all else. The Apple 2, Lisa and original Macintosh are barely covered. The Macintosh is almost designed \\"off-page\\", and there is one single solitary photograph of an original Apple Mac; a stock photograph that you have seen before. In contrast, concepts for the Apple Newton are spread leisurely over half a dozen pages. The book has a lot of design concepts which simply aren't as good as the finished product, and mid-80s / early-90s Apple computers were visually very dull anyway.    And then there's the text. Lots of it near the start, not so much later on. It's a very dry, corporate history of Apple's design, full of projects and companies with DoubleWords and e. e. cummings-esque lower-case text. The designer of the original Mac, Jerry Manock, is briefly mentioned near the beginning. Steve Wozniak, who designed the Apple 2 hardware and was one of the company's founders, is eliminated by page 14. He does not appear in the cast of characters at the end, although minor design assistants do, and Steve Jobs appears twice (he had just rejoined the company when the book was published). The only designer whose name I remember is Hartmut Esslinger, who comes across badly.    It's fascinating if you're into Apple's LC, IIFX era. Although the book sometimes seems like a Steve Jobs corporate whitewash job, it does have thorough coverage of John Sculley's Newton, and the eMate. For the price,however, I would rather buy a second-hand Mac Classic, and study that  instead.	2000-08-15

Both a biography of Keith Moon, and a decent history  of the group, this chunky, excellent book details one of the most extreme,  surreal lives in rock. From the non-stop constant hotel wrecking (which  starts off amusingly enough, but eventually becomes worrying when Keith  doesn't stop, ever), to the bizarre tale of his girlfriend calling the  actor Larry Hagman to help Keith get through an overdose, it's a portrait  of a man whose average weekend packed in more drink, drugs and destruction  than most people manage in a year. And all the time Moon remains mostly  likeable, although he isn't very nice towards his first wife, or old  people. Early on he admits that the only thing he could possibly do was  play drums - and as he lost interest in the drums, his life seemed to  spiral out of control. His eventual death (announced by Pete Thownshend to  Roger Daltrey with the telephone conversation 'He's gone and done it',  'What?', 'Moon') becomes increasingly inevitable, but no less sad for it.  Moon's tragedy was that, apart from being a hyperactive child, his  generation had no template to follow, and thus pushed themselves further  and harder than any rock stars since.	2000-08-01

Not so much an account of history as a vivid portrait of a  nightmare hell, 'Stalingrad' conveys the madness of a campaign in which  Russian deserters fought for the Germans, German deserters fought for the  Russians - a campaign in which those fighting had the choice of dying by  enemy fire, or by a bullet in the head from a morale officer - a campaign  in which the German army repeatedly smashed the hopelessly-led Russian  forces, and still lost. The sorry tale is run through with a horrible sense  of inevitability - anybody with a little WW2 knowledge knows how it all  turned out, and the way that the pieces fall into place make you want to  warn the people involved, somehow. By the time the German army is  surrounded in the broken ruins of a frozen city, with the nearest help  being increasingly fought all the way back to Germany, and supplies running  low, whilst at home Hitler orders them to stand, fight and die, you will  have learned a lot about human nature.<br />The lengthy battle itself was  brutal and drawn-out, and the aftermath was not at all pretty - captured  German wounded were simply executed, with the remaining soldiers being  marched to death. Those who survived often faced a future in a communist  East Germany that didn't really want them, or imprisonment - the thought of  the German officers languishing in prison until well into the era of  rock-and-roll seems jarring and odd.<br />Also of note is a decent film on the  subject, 'Stalingrad', produced by many of the same team responsible for  'Das Boot'.	2000-06-28

Regan's style combines amusement (the endless pompous  Napoleonic-era dukes and their rampant egos) and horror (the first ten  minutes of the Somme, during which one hundred allied soliders were killed  every second) at the same time, and doesn't restrict itself to the obvious  examples - the American Civil War seems to have been packed full of idiotic  decision-making, and the crusades were arguably one long blunder. That  said, there is copious material on the insane, otherworldly killing grounds  of World War One, a war that deserves somebody like Anthony Beever to write  a big book about.	2000-06-28

Coming out at the  turn of the 80's, it was unfortunately seen as being inappropriately  jingoistic, and thirty years out of date (the title itself giving the  unthinkable impression that there must also be a 'wrong stuff', too). That  said, if it had been released a few years later, we would all associate it  with the worst excesses of Rambo-ear Reagamerica. As with the other books,  you'll probably finish it in half an hour, although once you have done so  it's fun to flick through all the various footnotes and references - Tom  Charity has obviously done his research.	2000-06-27

It even has a small chapter on the  cultural impact of Bond, and the various Bondalikes, from light spoof such  as 'The Man from UNCLE' to more serious works from Len Deighton and John Le  Carre. It's a shame that this wasn't made bigger, really - although it  could easily have become unworkably huge, there isn't much to explain  exactly why Bond has appealed to us for almost half a century, and how he  has changed to fit the times.<br />As far as the book goes (and that's pretty  far), it's perfect - wisely, the authors don't try to 'rate' any of the  Bondibles, although they do go so far as to suggest that some of the later  John Gardner novels are less impressive than his earlier ones. The attempt  to keep up with the constantly-shifting Bond biography is amusing, too -  Fleming's Bond was born between the World Wars, and would now be enjoying  retirement, something which seems unlikely to happen to 'our' Bond any time  soon.	2000-06-27

Given that 'The Terminator' was produced quickly  on a low budget, and that not much was expected of it, no records were kept  of the filming, and there really isn't much to write about the making of  the film itself. Rather, the author takes us through the film, pointing out  the clever bits, and writing about them. It's almost as spartan and  efficient as the film itself - you'll probably finish it in half an hour,  and wish that it was longer.	2000-06-27

When I first saw this book I didn't even know that The Onion existed, and I have never seen a paper copy, but it doesn't matter; 'Our Dumb Century' is beyond reproach. It works on several levels, in that it is simultaneously funny, clever, and technically impressive; the evocation of old-style newspapers has been carried out with care and attention. As far as I am aware none of the stories are reprints of material already published.    The headlines for Neil Armstrong's moon landing, and for the outbreak of the two World Wars (\\"Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia declares war on Germany declares war on France declares war on Turkey declares war on Belgium declares war on Russia declares war on Britain, Ottoman Empire almost declares war on self\\", and \\"WA-\\" respectively), have already seeped into the internet's popular consciousness to a certain extent, and rather like an episode of Spitting Image or the Fast Show, the dull bits - particularly the text-heavy early pages - can easily be skipped over, although doing so is to miss some wry laughs.    I can't remember laughing out loud whilst reading this book, but that's because I was probably eating something at the time, because I like to eat whilst I am reading - also, I find that if I fill my mouth with something, it stops me from saying bad things. This book is not a bad thing, it is a good thing, and I am glad that it exists, and that I exist to experience it, and that we all agree to that. When I touch this book, I like to imagine myself touching the other reviewers here on Amazon.com, I would like to shake your hand. Goodnight.

That's it -  they drive and fight and drive and fight, for fourteen days.<br />The approach  is both honest (we learn nothing about the outside world) and slightly  unsatisfying - the book lacks the political depth of a Tom Clancy novel,  and the resolutely realistic tone lacks the pulpy thrills of Larry Bond. In  fact it's not so much a 'thriller', as a 'mockumentary'.<br />Two further  points that will strike you as you read the book:- 1. The Russians. They're  hopeless. 2. Birmingham. Ulp.	2000-06-05

Trilogy: The Eye in the Pyramid, The Golden Apple, Leviathan	Books	2	12	18	N	N	Elsewhere	A great example of how size and complexity do not equal depth or worth, this large, culty trilogy is more or less a white-noise barrage of meaningless events splattered over a thousand or so pages. As a proper  novel it's a big shaggy-dog story, and as a reading experience it's just  not interesting enough. By the end I was reading it as a grudge, just to  prove that I could do it.<br />It's dated, too - the female character(s)  are/is there for the men to have sex with - and the time- and space-hopping  narrative isn't nearly as clever as it seems to think. It has some  memorably smug characters, too, and the air of something dreamed up and  written down one night whilst bored.	2000-05-31

It  isn't high art, but it's excellent at what it does - after a slow, ominous  build-up (which takes up the first half of the novel) it's pretty much  constant action from then on, on land, on sea, and in the air. The book's  only real downside is the abrupt ending - after building the enemy up for  650 pages, they seem to collapse very quickly.<br />This was Larry Bond's  debut novel, and it has some rough edges - Bond is more concerned with the  ebb and flow of brigades than individual people, and personal crises (of  the 'I'm scared', 'Pull yourself together', 'Okay - I'll try' level) are  resolved in a few paragraphs. There's a stab at romance, too, something his  subsequent novels steer clear of. Nonetheless, Bond's talent is  fully-formed, and this is the best novel to start with (both 'Cauldron' and  'Vortex' are less immediate - South Africa seems less gripping, somehow,  and 'Vortex' is set in a near future world which seems increasingly  abstract).<br />As a footnote, it makes a fascinating companion-piece to the  PC/Mac 'Falcon 4.0', a simulation of flying an F-16 over just such a  conflict, with the same locations and technology.<br />Is it an unwritten rule  that novels of this ilk always start off with an isolated commando raid?	2000-05-30

Like him or love him, you've got to admit - drive-in movies are dead, dead and gone, and they have been for twenty years or more. People just don't have cars any more, not since the oil crisis did  away with them, the great spitting beasts that they are. And films don't  work in the open, not since they moved to using straw instead of celluloid.  It must have been great to see - colours and shapes, moving through the  night, instead of the rubbish we have now, just bales of straw being shot  out of the projector onto the screen. Can you imagine that? It's horrible,  really it is. Robert A. Heinlein is also dead and gone. I think. Just a  moment... just a moment.... he died in 1988, no doubt due to the effects of  acid house. All those pulsing beats suddenly thrust into the mainstream  must have done him in. I can see him dancing, dancing to the grave, lost in  the grip of E, whizzing his old flesh off his bones. It must have been  something. I think of 1988 as being like '19', but with breasts.	2000-05-19

Set in the last years of the  80's, but equally applicable at any time, 'American Psycho' mixes social  commentary with gruesome new uses for common household implements.<br />As a  blueprint for living it's like a sickness - a certain type of company-car  driving travelling sales rep will find the descriptions of expensive  clothes and exclusive apartments positively masturbatory, although by the  end of the book they may well want to become a socialist. That's only half  of the book, though.<br />The violence is fantastic - you'll never look at a  car battery in the same way again - but at the same time it seems oddly  out-of-place, as if the book didn't really need to be about a psychotic  killer. Certainly, the idea that a soul-less, empty murderer would actually  get on quite well in The City is deliciously, horribly true, but the  murders all seem so unreal it's hard to see why they are there. If they are  all in the mind of the main character, it makes a bit more sense - in that  case, Patrick Bateman is a dweeb, living an imaginary life in which he is a  god.<br />All in all it's a great success, and any book that makes you think  twice about buying expensive water-activated gel cleansers is a Good Book,  in my opinion.	2000-05-19

If you're a self-obsessed idiot (such as me), people don't really notice until you have a sniff of fame, at  which point your ego swells and you become a hideous parody of  nature.<br />It's possible to be famous and decent - for some reason, a lot of  cartoonists seem to be well-adjusted (both Gary Larson and Bill Watterson  had the good grace to retire before they messed up, and although I never  really liked Peanuts I can't remember Charles Shulz ever floating a  twenty-foot-tall statue of himself down the Thames). Perhaps it's because  they realised from day one that they themselves are anonymous, and that  their art is not 'serious', in the deeply, awfully earnest sense of the  word 'serious'.<br />Perhaps it's the cult of personality. The wave of one-hit  techno bands in the early-90's tried to circumvent this by being anonymous  (remember Altern-8?). At the time people thought that it was because they  were just ugly, and they wanted to hide it, but when I think of Orbital I  think of the music on 'The Brown Album', and when I think of Geri Halliwell  I think of her evil grasping ugly mind desperately clawing for more and  more fame and I want to spit on her music and kill her. &quot;	2000-05-19

A fantastic overview of the Sesame Street continuum, this heavily-illustrated tome has songs, behind-the-scenes information, a giant picture of Count Von Count laughing maniacally (worth the price of entry  along), and lots of neat information with which to dazzle your friends  (apparently Oscar the Grouch was originally brown).<br />The only drawback is  a confusion of purpose - it's not sure whether it's a guide for kids or  grown-ups, and the information is therefore fairly light (there's no  episode guide, for example, and Buffy Saint-Marie is never mentioned fully  by name). Still, it's a great thing to have around, and you can dip into it  every so often for a new fact.<br />Best of all, it'll make you want to watch  the show again, if you aren't already - it's one of the finest things on  television anywhere, and anything that encourages people to watch it is a  Good Thing in my opinion.	2000-05-17

The  deaths of millions happen in the background, and nobody has a chance to  pause for breath - the novel is fast-paced and, despite its great length,  compelling from start to finish.<br />Downsides? Written in the late 80's, the  novel seems to belong to a different world - the Russians are still  boo-hiss villains, NATO is a mighty military powerhouse, and there are bits  which are clearly filler (the sections dealing with South Korean seem only  tangental to the plot). Still, only 'The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy'  has as much wanton destruction, and if you've ever wanted to smash things,  this book will calm you down.	2000-05-16

During the decade he championed a range of socially-unacceptable bands, moving from Lou Reed and the Velvet  Underground to Punk, and on to the New Wave, whilst simultaneously  informing the public against such contemporary delights as Chicago, and  James Taylor. As you turn the page you can see him change as a writer and  as a person - originally writing in a sub-Beat jive-style he sharpens up as  the decade wears on, and you feel sorry that he didn't live to see the rest  of the 80's and the 90's. Quite what he would have made of grunge, MTV,  Madonna, acid house, I don't know.<br />Unlike many other rock critics, Bangs  gives the impression that he actually likes music, that he still has faith,  and that he doesn't want to use rock writing as a vehicle for  self-promotion. Coming off as an American John Peel, you can even forgive  the casual racism of some of the earlier pieces, especially as he recants  later on in the book. Not all of it works very well - some of the more  freeform pieces make you realise why Editors exist, and a lot of the book  depends on whether you share his philosophy on rock (basically, but not  entirely - good music comes from the heart, even when it isn't 'good', and  not necessarily the head).<br />Besides, any book with a whole chapter devoted  to Lou Reed's legendary 'Metal Machine Music' is worth a read.	2000-05-16

If nothing else, 'All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others' will  live forever. The later '1984' tackled a similar theme in a bleaker, more  monotonous manner, and seems to lack the sense of disgust that permeates  'Animal Farm'.<br />Despite being a 'classic', with all that entails, it's  actually quite short, to-the-point, blackly comic, and written in a clear,  crisp style that makes you wish all political allegory was so  easily-approachable. A generation of schoolchildren were probably put off  this book by school (for a time it was a popular, slightly-controversial  choice amongst English teachers), and traumatised by the sad fate of Boxer,  the horse.<br />There was an aminated film, too - equally effective, it stuck  faithfully to the novel, with the addition of a more optimistic ending, one  which seemed to mirror the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.	2000-05-12

Surreal, satirical and often plain silly, Peter Cook's comedy was like Monty Python with fangs. Achieving everything he could hope for at the  beginning of his career, he spent the rest of his life looking for a  vehicle, suffering the same fate as countless other unique comic talents -  years ahead of his time, he was eventually marginalised by an establishment  that couldn't find a role for him, ending his career with a few brilliant  flourishes and a sense that he never really fitted in.<br />The biography  itself is the best that can be hoped for - despite a lack of support from  Cook's last wife, Harry Thompson interviews almost everybody who knew him,  and the book covers everything he did up to and including 'Why Bother?',  with Chris Morris. At the end of the book you'll want to go out and buy the  complete 'Beyond the Fringe' recordings, and a higher compliment cannot be  paid.	2000-05-12

Published in 1991, it's the sourcebook for a cyberpunk universe, but it's more interesting as an extremely dated, nostalgic  cultural artifact, a reminder of a time, not so long ago, when the future  seemed a lot more futuristic. Amongst the primitive Amiga-ed CGI and  'System Shock'-esque descriptions of 'Black IC', 'decks' and 'frames' is  the sense that people once thought the internet would be more than just a  home-shopping network, the sense that Japan would inevitably dominate the  business world, and the sense that, in the future, people would have  dreadlocks and wear thin, slitted sunglasses.	2000-05-12

The details of the company's split with IBM over OS/2 seems born of  frustration at a missed opportunity, and although the tone is very dry, and  the book tends to deal with obvious, opinion-free accounts of fact, it's an  entertaining thing to dip into before going to bed.<br />Quite why it has a  ...'special surcharge' I don't know.	2000-05-11

My hardback copy dates from 1971, and originally cost 1.50 ukp. It's a fairly slim collection of material based around the first couple of series of the show - an advertisement for  'Whizzo Chocolate Assortment', a series of introductions from  increasingly-flustered newsreaders, pages of classified ads, and more than  a few naked women. It's much less effective than the television show - the  transcriptions lose a lot without the delivery, and the original bits seem  rushed.

Covering colour theory, the design of attractive and  appropriate icons, the proper use of dialogue boxes, menus and design  elements, this is a big, thick, well-designed tome that can also double as  a handy paperweight. <br />Way back in 1987 Apple's Macintosh operating system  was the first and last word in windoed, graphical users interfaces for the  home. Whilst the rest of the world parted contact with Apple's supposedly  juvenile vision of computing 'for the rest of us', the company were laying  the groundwork for modern interface design. Hiring not just designers, but  psychologists and sociologists, Apple established a ruthlessly consistent  design methodology based around clear, universal metaphors. Some would say  that the rest of the computing world has been playing catch-up ever since -  including, oddly, Apple, as some of the recent efforts (notably the  Quicktime 4.0 interface) place style far above content.<br />The book has very  few flaws - the dry tone is an inevitable result of its status as a  reference work, and those who despise Apple's design guidelines probably  will never, ever read this. You can't really read it all the way through,  either - it's best to dip in here and there, reading chapters at will.  Despite these negligable points, this book is invaluable for anybody  designing a digital human interface, and the section on black-and-white  icons is suddenly relevant again in the WAP age. Indeed, everything here is  still bang-up-to-date, which tends to suggest either that Apple got it  right a long time ago, or that interface design has been paralysed for two  decades.	2000-05-05

Before reading 'The Tao of Pooh' I assumed it was a long philosophical tract scattered with quotes from the 'Winnie the Pooh' books to give it a gimmicky marketing push. It wasn't - it was a genuinely interesting  introduction to Taoism, with a valid Pooh connection. It didn't push its  viewpoint as being better than any other, and was thus inoffensive.<br />'The  Te of Piglet', on the other hand, is terrible - a lengthy rant about the  authors' pet hates, scattered with a few quotes from the 'Winnie the Pooh'  books as dressing.<br />The author has two points. Firstly, that small things  are not necessarily insignificant (a great point, one which just took me  six words to express), and secondly, that feminists, scientists, critics,  technology, businessmen, microwave ovens, negative viewpoints, unhelpful  opinions and bad thoughts will be swept away in an inevitable cleansing,  leaving the author and his friends to inherit the earth.<br />And the author  is right, constantly. If you think otherwise, you're contributing to the  forces of negativity, and will be swept aside. There is no other way. It's  this kind of thing that puts me off religion.<br />However, to fill the book  up, the author seems to wind himself into a twisted rage, berating  everything in the world which is not him, for being shallow, self-obsessed,  and destructive. Eventually he becomes angry, and loses perspective and  self-awareness, and you start to notice silly things that you would have  ignored beforehand. Eventually I imagined the author as an bearded real-ale  drinker muttering bitter thoughts to himself in a house in California, and  at that point I couldn't take anything he said seriously again.<br />For  example, slotted in near the end is the tale of a great king who liked the  sound of a nightingale singing so much that, when presented with a flawless  clockwork replica, he neglected the real nightingale until it flew away.  Over time the clockwork nightingale broke, and the kingfelt sad until the  real nightingale returned. This is presented as great wisdom, but my  initial response was 'this is froth'. What does it mean? Presumably the  author sees it as a cautionary tale against the evils of metal, but, if you  think about it for a moment and don't accept it blindly, it means nothing  at all, it's just an empty quote with the illusion of depth. Much the same  could be said about the rest of the book - we are constantly told to learn  from real life, whilst being presented by wisdom presented as narrative  descriptions of life in Ancient China.<br />Whilst 'Pooh' had a light touch,  'Piglet' attempts to bludgeon the reader with the author's viewpoints, and  by the final chapter I felt like reading through the nasty bits of  'American Psycho' again, just to calm down.<br />Take Eeyore, for example.  He's a loveable misanthrope, a welcome note of gloom in the 'Winnie the  Pooh' books, who seems bitter but, deep down, means well. The author hates  him, however. Really, truly hates him. He doesn't just disapprove of him,  he actually hates him.<br />'The Tao of Pooh' is a great book - even if you're  a cynical soul, after reading it you can accept Taoism and respect it, even  if you don't agree with its way of seeing the world. 'The Te of Piglet', on  the other hand, will make you want to attack the author and his beliefs  with a broom.	2000-04-28

It works brilliantly just as an episode guide,  and the mistakes are well-chosen and quite perceptive.

I seem to remember that, shortly after  appearing in print, it was published on-line, as a downloadable text file.  Reading it nowadays, it's a fascinating, nostalgic portrait of a time long  gone, and anybody who used to listen to Bomb the Bass whilst playing 'Xenon  2' on their Amiga A500Plus (after flicking through 'Judge Dredd: The  Megazine') will shed a tear at an era of C64s, terminal emulators,  communist-bloc computer criminals, and a time when computer crime was so  low-profile that the term 'cracker' had not yet been invented.<br />1990 seems  so far away.

It doesn't really have much of a point, and the author was clearly making  it all up as he went along (the abstract nature of 'Cimon' renders  conventional plotting superfluous), but provided you don't take it at all  seriously it's a light-hearted romp through a surreal, infinite  world.<br />This particular edition was published in associated with Wired  magazine - despite the awful essay that introduces it, it has nothing to do  with cyberpunk at all (there are *no* in-line skates, and at no point does  our hero plant explosives in somebody's head), and is all the better for  it.	2000-02-29
