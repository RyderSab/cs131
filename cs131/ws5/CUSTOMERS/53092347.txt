Rather it is Bishop's personal account of what happened when he won the Nobel Prize in \\"physiology or medicine\\" in 1989.  This is told in a rather light-hearted, self deprecating way that is at once amusing and informative--he provides plenty of background on the prize itself, as well as the logistics of the ceremony of the presentation.<br /><br />Actually the book is something of a grab-bag of topics.  It is partly autobiographical, partly historical accounts of cancer research, and partly a commentary on the issues of the public's perception and misperceptions on science and society.  And partly about the discovery that he and Harold Varmus made--the first oncogene.<br /><br />Although I much enjoyed the other parts, it was to learn something of the discovery itself that brought me to buy the book.  And here I must say I was a little disappointed.  Basically, they found that one of the four genes carried by the Rous sarcoma virus is also found in the dna of many species of animals, including man.  In fact it is found in normal cells, as well as those that are cancerous, and is expressed in both.  I found this all a bit confusing.  Is it the over-expression of the SRC gene responsible for some cancers, or is it a damaged form of the gene that is responsible?  Is it an oncogene or a proto-oncogene?  What does it do?<br /><br />The current paradigm for cancer causation is that one of a few oncogenes and/or tumor supressor genes malfunction to give rise to cancer.  I had hoped for a clearer statement of this rather dogmatic idea, and perhaps even some pros and cons for it.  What makes a gene qualify for oncogene status?  This is never made clear.  What has become of SRC?  What has been found out in the 30 years since the discovery?  Has anyone ever seen a cancer in which only the supposed oncogene is different from that seen in the normal cell?  I don't think so.<br /><br />An opposing theory to this is that the fundamental event in cancer is aneuploidy:  the cancer cell contains an abnormal number of chromosomes, thereby over-expressing some thousands of genes at once.  Surprisingly, Bishop does not mention this alternative at all.  Maybe the oncogene hypothesis is just plain wrong after all.  And Peter Duesberg's paradigm is closer to the truth.<br /><br />Bishop's last chapter covers some of the public controversies:  stem cells and cloning, genetic testing and evolution.  He gives us his two cents worth on all of them, and I can't help but think he is right on most of what he says.  He's got a lot of common sense, and expresses it pretty well.to this is that the fundamental event in cancer is aneuploidy:  the cancer cell contains an abnormal number of chromosomes, thereby over-expressing some thousands of genes at once.

If you answer twenty years from now, you'd be wrong by about 60 years--they first became widely used in the 1960's!  Only they were called \\"bone marrow transplants.\\"  Today thousands of them are done every year.<br /><br />Hall has written a dozen so excellent books on medicine, biotechnology and molecular biology, and this is one of the best.  Here he recounts the development of the idea that aging in humans can be scientifically understood and modified.  He starts off with the wonderful story of the Hayflick limit with an account of his first interview with him and brings this maverick character to life.  How often are the big ideas discovered by rogues and rebels--fearless men?<br /><br />He covers a very wide swath of current developments in the cutting edge of biology and medicine--telomeres, stem cells, transplants, cloning,  and aging--all told in enough depth that you can't help but learn something, even if you are pretty well informed.  The history, the personalities, and the ideas are all here.<br /><br />One thing I appreciated is that Hall makes no pretense about being disinterested in the subject--he takes some of it personally, and is not afraid to relate what his gut is telling him.  He is partisan in the best sense of the word.  He unflinchingly challenges the idealistic \\"bioethicists\\" who have lately ejected such nonsense into the public space, pretending to a certainty only a bishop could appreciate.<br /><br />Hall also relates in some detail the evolution of the stem cell/cloning debate that has resulted in the policy that federal money can go to research only on the 70 embryonic stem cell lines already in existence, now known to be more like 6.  And none of them suitable for therapeutic for humans because they are grown on a substrate of mouse cells and their viruses. The yokels and theologians have managed to set back this important avenue for improving human health by who knows how many decades...

Others, such as Alfred Kinsey, are sensational frauds who became heroes to journalists, always in need of another dose of tawdry trash to sell.  Still others, such as Rigoberta Menchu and Betty Friedan, are activists who have serious problems with their autobiographies.<br /><br />I enjoyed Flynn's rather amorphous collection of miscellany about these phonies, who have undoubtedly made some impact on the ruminations of the booboisee.  They will inevitably sink into the oblivion they deserve, but probably not soon enough for most honest people.  They will have plenty of company there.  I remember being pulled into something of this sort as a young man.  Who cares about existentialism these days?  It is now sufficiently obscure that Flynn doesn't even include it.  The time I wasted in reading this baloney in college is a real lesson for me.  I could have been drinking beer or watching girls...<br /><br />People of the Enlightenment have always had to contend with the ignorance and superstition of the masses, and have developed some pretty good tools to oppose the irrational and the nihilistic, dark side of the human beast.  The more elevated phonies, the bishops and the professors of nonsense, have been mostly quite puny in their effect compared to the efforts of the scientists and engineers, with their fondness for numbers and graphs, replication, clarity and ceaseless experimentation. They progressively revealed a reality the nihilists cannot even imagine.  The engineers have given us electricity and the automobile, the transistor and the internet.  What have the phonies given us, aside from a raft of references in the Social Sciences Citation Index?<br /><br />Flynn's debunking of these characters is fairly effective sometimes.  Other chapters, such as the one on the Chambers-Hiss affair, should have been left out--it has already fallen into the abyss of irrelevance.<br /><br />And I had always thought that The Kinsey Report was on the up and up.  Flynn shows that it had an utter disregard for statistical sampling methods and was only an ax grinding, made up by a pervert.

This is a very big task, and has no well defined beginning or end, nor even very many milestones.  Moreover, there are, according to Stearns, nearly as many paths to development as there are countries that develop.  No tipping points, no critical inventions and no heroic personalities either.  While I suppose there is a certain truth to this point of view, and may even be historically accurate, it makes for a somewhat dull read.  I prefer to have my history laced with a few gee-whizes accomplished by some impossibly heroic figures.  But that's just me.<br /><br />His recitation of the changes that took place is almost formless, without generalities, or even much definition.  While it was certainly humbling to contemplate the breadth of his scholarship, I didn't get what I was looking for out of this work--some hypotheses or possible explanations for what happened.  I appreciate the difficulty of the problem and the mystery of ultimate historical causation, but the author would have been better off, I think, if he had taken a little stab at it, at least.<br /><br />The book has four maps and a dozen or so illustrations, but only five graphs--and most of those are ridiculously parsimonious in the amount of data shown.  Surely in a subject of this scope, tables and better graphs would have helped to organize it.<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings, I think the book is a worthwhile contribution to the history of a very important part of the human story, and I'm glad to have read it.	2004-11-14

Having a college age son served to increase my interest in the theme of the book:  the culture of today's university scene.  Naturally, though, despite this, I can't really say how close to the truth Wolfe gets.  But he creates a world of characters that are brought vividly to life, with conflicts and problems that are so painfully universal, that the book will surely scare an awful lot of parents like me.  Alcohol and sex is a dominant motif, overlain with a bit of ambition, innocence and political correctness.<br /><br />The story is told mostly from the perspective of a brilliant and inexperienced girl from the mountains of North Carolina, whose beauty opens the door to a world of possibilities that she rightly instinctively fears, and inevitably makes the mistakes that the reader can see coming from a mile away.  Probably having made some variation of the same mistakes themselves.<br /><br />Wolfe is a terrific writer, whose insight into the current scene is so penetrating and entertaining, that he is unsurpassed by anyone writing novels today.  He is right up there with H. L. Mencken, I think.  Wolfe has the same appreciation of the English language as actually spoken, and this book is filled with his observations and ruminations of the world that it reveals.  Sexiled?  Kicked out of your room by your roommate, who is having a visitor requiring privacy.  Hah!	2004-11-13

I, like many others, was aware of the marketing hype before its publication, and waited for its production with a feeling something like that of a child anticipating a Christmas, an incomprehensible number of weeks off.<br /><br />I actually read a good part of this book, and found it to be something quite awesome.  Moreover, I was not at all put off by its idiosyncratic style, and I much appreciated its typography, layout and the richness in its illustrations.

Computational hydrodynamics and thermodynamics,  free will and language, cryptography and logic, quantum mechanics and Feynmen diagrams, crystallization, coarsening foams and sandpiles, evolution and embryology, traffic and financial markets.  Is there any other work having a single author that encompasses such a collection?<br /><br />The notes section, about 300 pages long, is wonderful to read all by itself.  Each topic has its bit of history related, and there are many descriptions of things discovered and things yet to be discovered, told in a most entertaining and readable style.  I could even recommend, perhaps, that some readers should read this section first.<br /><br />My reaction toward the \\"bottom line\\" hypothesis, that cellular automata provide a real breakthrough in understanding the world, is a little agnostic, perhaps.  Interesting in many ways, and the hydrodynamic model is clearly a fruitful one--I've seen some quite stunning movies of certain phenomena (such as two liquids of different density that are mixing).  I really can't evaluate some of the claims Wolfram makes, and others seem to be a bit overblown.

Nevertheless, I gained something of an appreciation for the subject and am always interested when something important enough happens that it gets into the popular press.  So naturally enough, I have been aware of the number one unsolved problem of mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis, and have followed the sporadic claims of its resolution over the last few decades.<br /><br />Mr. Sabbagh's popular treatment of the problem in this book was a delight for me to read.  He explains the hypothesis very clearly in a way that really doesn't even require any specialized knowledge of any arcane area of mathematics.  Though great, this is not the primary virtue of the book.  Rather it is his effort to reach out to the dozen or so mathematicians who are actively working on the problem who might have a hope of finally, after about a century and a half, of proving it. The reader is thus led to some appreciation of the world of the professional mathematician, with all of its human hopes and jealousies, striving to achieve a legacy that will outlive themselves.  Sabbagh interviews them, some of them several times, attends their seminars, and listens for the inside dope that might show that someone somewhere is onto something.<br /><br />The book is engaging, and I found it impossible to put down.  It has lots of anecdotes, asides, and curiosities along the way to liven up the story.  It is brutally honest in its portrayals of the principle characters.  The writing style is lively, and the math is easy to follow.  And it tells a story of man at his best--striving for progress, precision and truth.  Quite the opposite of so many charlatans of the academy today, who seem to revel in ambiguity, imprecision, and political correctness.	2004-10-22

His accomplishments were great, and the story of his life cannot help but be instructive to devotees of \\"The Daily Show\\" which captures the caliber of our current crop of politicos so well.<br /><br />It would be a terrific class assignment for an undergraduate to \\"compare and contrast\\" Hamilton's writings with those of a Bush or a Kerry, a Kennedy or a Clinton.  It would make them tremble for our political system, that currently throws up such clowns and showmen into the public space instead of statesmen and accomplished men such as Hamilton, Washington and Jefferson.  Hamilton never had a speechwriter---indeed he wrote much of Washington's famed farewell address.  Hamilton never had a ghostwriter--he wrote most of the Federalist Papers himself in a mere seven months.  His output was prodigious, and his role in getting the Constitution ratified unmatched by any man.  He never went to Yale.  His dad never amounted to much.  His physical courage was displayed for all to see in the battles he fought during the revolution, and in his final confrontation with Burr.  Not for him a hide-out in the National Guard, nor did he fight in an unjust war.  A man of honor, clearly a doer and a thinker, a principled man, a genius.<br /><br />Chernow's tome tells the story with eloquence and scholarship, in a lively way that rarely bogs down in tedious detail.  Not without some shortcomings, though.  His research into Hamilton's childhood and his forebears was, I thought, a bit too detailed.  The endless recounting of the scurrilous attacks on Hamilton's background and character by relative non-entities are over-emphasized, but in a world that mostly  associates in its mind Jefferson with Sally Hemmings, this is only to be expected, I suppose.  Likewise for Hamilton's encounter with a pair of blackmailers.  I'd rather that Chernow had spent as much effort on the ideas contained in the Federalist Papers, which I felt were, as Hamilton's crowning achievement, somewhat slighted.<br /><br />In spite of all this, this book is really a wonder, and will reward any sentient American, even those who mostly get their political instruction from such comedians that inhabit our political space as John Stewart, Jay Lenno, and Dan Rather.t on the ideas contained in the Federalist Papers, which I felt were, as Hamilton's crowning achievement, somewhat slighted.

The peopling of the Americas has some special interest, of course, not the least because it is so controversial.  The central dogma, found in all the textbooks and encyclopedias of our day, is that the earliest Americans arrived at about 11,000 BC or so ago, and the route was over the Beringian land bridge from Siberia to Alaska.<br /><br />This book, written by a very well informed journalist, is an honest effort at an examination of the data, pro and con, for the dogma, told in a most delightful way.  Her method is to read everything, visit every museum involved, and interview everybody involved in the controversy that she can.  It is not a dry tome that merely relates the findings, but a sort of personal journey through it, a travelogue to some of the important sites, and a reflection on the meaning of it all.<br /><br />What she finds is at times quite eye-opening and even sometimes pretty distressing.  It seems that the dogma is so strong that some investigators suppress evidence against it for fear of losing standing and funding, which is controlled by a tyranical old guard, charged with a righteous fervor to protect it.<br /><br />I found the story quite fascinating.  Was it possible for people to traverse the land at the time required?  Apparently not, according to the latest findings.  Are there sites older than 11,000 BC?  It seems there were!  A most persuasive argument to me was the finding that the migrants brought the hookworm with them.  Because the hookworm must reside for part of its life-cycle in warm soil, it could not have come by the Beringian route.  Pretty persuasive to me!<br /><br />The style of writing is lively and immediate and the book is hard to put down, once started.  I only regret that there are no illustrations at all.<br /><br />Dewar has done quite an outstanding job in bring this story together, and it will reward your time spent with it.as done quite an outstanding job in bring this story together, and it will reward your time spent with it.	2004-10-21

Taking notes longhand, especially with my nearly illegible handwriting, was a chore that I really hated.  When xeroxing came along, my life was made a little bit better--I could walk out of the library with something I could at least read and file, even if I didn't always get around to it.  I still have several file cabinets of the stuff that I can't bear to throw away.<br /><br />Mr. Owen has provided a very nice account of how the xerox machine was invented and developed into the indispensable tool we all know today, and a biography of the fascinating man who had the vision to see it through.  Some parts of the story are pretty well known by those interested at all in the history of technology, but Owen provides lots of unique material that I've not seen elsewhere.  This is not one of those business books that tries to derive \\"lessons\\" from xerox's missteps in its later years, but rather focusses on the genesis of the invention, up to the early years after the release of the model 914.<br /><br />I was most intrigued by the struggle Carlson went through to get any industrial organization to help in the development of the machine--IBM and others really dropped the ball on this one!  In the early years, the opinion of the \\"technical experts\\" was nearly one of universal dismissal.  Later, when development was well underway, the marketing consultants also failed to predict even to an order of magnitude how many copies would be produced at the average business site.  The lesson is, if you have something really unique, forget about polls and market research.<br /><br />There were lots of interesting anecdotes for the author to have some fun with, and he does it very well.  I especially appreciated when he injected himself into the story, interviewing some the principals, and even making a xerox by hand.  This livens up the story considerably.  The bibliography, while not exhaustive, is quite extensive and will be quite handy for anyone mining for another Ph. D.  There are 18 pages of glossy photos and plenty of line drawings to help the reader along too.<br /><br />This is an inspiring tale of how one man can still make a difference, and any reader will come away from it feeling a little better about the prospects for the future of mankind, and a little less cynical about the nature of man, the engineer.te extensive and will be quite handy for anyone mining for another Ph.

This was, we quickly learn, horrifying and almost unbelievable to modern ears.  The helplessness and despair, starvation and economic ruin!  Lockwood's account is to this reader, at least, could have been a little shorter--I got to the \\"enough awready\\"  stage pretty soon.  But it does set the stage for the question (which I had wondered about myself):  what happened to them?  Why haven't they recurred over the last century?  Might they come back?<br /><br />Lockwood, as a young professional entomologist, was unhappy with previous explanations and decided to try to answer this question with as much certainty as he could, using real data and a little less speculation.  He relates the historical hypotheses in some detail, showing the reader their inadequacies in a pretty convincing way.  A nice approach is that he provides lots of biographical detail of the earlier entomologists who were concerned with the mystery, which livens up the tale too.  By the time he got to his own explanation, I was ready for it, and was pretty well convinced to boot.<br /><br />I especially appreciated the way he consistently tried to get quantitative about various aspects of the problem.  He doesn't just say that the swarms were awful big, but calculates that the biomass at times was as large as all the buffalo in the West.  There are numbers here.  I like that.<br /><br />I was interested to read about his expeditions to find remnants of the swarms on glaciers, his trials with getting funding and published, and the passion he has for his subject.  I was a little amused by the sympathy he develops for the locust, which sometimes even veers toward a mystical reverence for them, and a regret for their passing.  Not many pioneers felt that way, I think.<br /><br />The twist at the very end of the book was quite startling to me.  I wonder, will anyone follow up on it?<br /><br />The book is a little long-winded to some, perhaps, but I appreciated the thoroughness with which he approached the work, and found it to be quite fascinating, and thought his work to be something of a triumph.

Elegans story for about thirty years.  Once I was even motivated enough to try to isolate the worm from some soil so I could play around with it for myself.  The attempt failed--I don't know why--but I never lost my vicarious interest in it.  This is the first book that I've read that covers the story in a \\"behind the scenes\\" way, and I was glad to see it published.<br /><br />The worm now, is of course, one of the best understood multicellular organisms in all of biology.  How it came to be a model organism rivaling the mouse, the fruit fly, and man is an interesting lesson in how science at its best really works.  It was a man, Sydney Brenner, with a plan to pick just the right organism that  could be used to attack some of the fundamental questions of genetics, development and embryogenesis.  The selection of this organism took several years of hard work.  It is remarkable that during this start-up of the project, the funding organization, the MRC, supported the work without complaint, even though it was something like five years before publications began to roll out.<br /><br />The book is written for a general audience, though there is lots here of interest to those who are more acquainted with biology too.  The politics and personalities of the effort, now almost fifty years on, are covered in quite a bit of depth and some of it is pretty entertaining.  The technical aspects of the research is also explained in enough detail that the reader can follow it pretty easily, though there are a few challenging rough spots too.<br /><br />This is quite a tale of heroic science getting done with a conviction that unselfish, cooperative,  non-commercial, basic research is not only worthwhile, but can be a lot of fun.  And these guys clearly had a lot of fun.  I think that one of the main reasons, pointed out by the author, was that the researchers were crammed in together with perhaps only a meter of bench space, and often not even a desk, had a lot to do with it.  No closed doors, no power point, and no email probably had a lot to do with it too.<br /><br />The book could have been better organized--the jumping around in time (what decade was this?) sometimes was bothersome to me.  The portraits of the scientists were nice to see, but I'd have appreciated some drawings of the worm too.  Pictures of the laboratory would have been instructive, I think.<br /><br />Brown has done a quite respectable job with this book, and I think it is quite worth reading if you have any interest at all in biology or the history of science.  The effort described will serve to confound the deconstructionists, mystics and other quacks of the academy for a long time to come.ften not even a desk, had a lot to do with it.

This factory employed hundreds of workers. doing some awful, monotonous, carpal tunnel-generating routines.  They made only the most basic stuff, quickly and cheaply.  Nothing produced was of much beauty, but it was the town's most important employer, and many workers gave their lives over to it.<br /><br />Wedgewood pottery has always intrigued me--how the devil do they produce such incredibly beautiful stuff, so different from what I saw there?  How are the finer pieces made with such reproducibility and perfection?  There is a fine story here and Dolan has told it well.<br /><br />When Josiah Wedgewood was born in 1730, the youngest of twelve children, into the home of a potter in the Britain's Midlands.  His humble beginnings, rising through the ranks, finally, at the age of 29, led him to establish his own small pottery business.  Wedgewood was determined to achieve greater success and made a key decision--that he would continuously improve the processes used and invent new and wonderful things.  He established a routine of constant experimentation and recorded all of his results meticulously into a laboratory notebook.  He was constantly looking for new combinations of materials and firing methods to get new glazes and improved results.  He looked for reliable, reproducible processes that could be introduced into his small factory.  And he inspired his men to improve right along with the processes by paying careful attention to their working conditions, their safety, and their security.  His men loved him, and he succeeded to become the foremost manufacturer of his day.<br /><br />Wedgewood's paid very careful attention to the fashions of the day, and strived to keep abreast.  This required an approach that was constantly changing--resting on one's laurels and yesterday's success would only lead to failure.  He produced much that was top of the line, and learned to market to the trend setters and royalty, then moving the product into the growing middle class.<br /><br />The setting in which he struggled was the early industrial revolution, where change was accelerating in Britain through a confluence of forces that are only poorly understood even today.  Giants seemed to stalk the earth, and Wedgewood came to know many of them.  He knew James Watt, and his metal-working partner Mathew Boulton, who at one point even tried to compete with him.  This was the era of canal-building, and Wedgewood played a big role in this too.<br /><br />Much of this story is contained, though in much less detail, in _The Lunar Men_ by Jenny Uglow, which I would also recommend.  Curiously, though, Wedgewood is counted as one of the five central members of the Lunar Society (encompassing a whole column in the index), this is mentioned only once by Dolan.<br /><br />The author has done an outstanding job in this book and it is well written.  The sixteen pages of glossy photos contribute a lot to the book too.  The story told here is an inspiring one, and will certainly encourage the reader to learn more about this astounding era.failure.

His early career was built primarily on a book, \\"Recent Advances in Cytology\\" which brought together a coherent picture of the chromosomes and their role in evolution.  Perhaps a key insight, new with him, was that though the chromosomes contained the hereditary information, they could be understood better by seeing how evolution affected them as well.<br /><br />Darlington was a confirmed materialist, hard headed scientist, but was positively attracted by controversy, and a rather intolerant, arrogant character to boot.  He had many enemies, but was a forceful and prominent public voice, who relished his role.  This combination makes for a lively biography, and deserves serious consideration by anyone interested  in the history of the development of the \\"modern synthesis\\" of evolutionary thought.  He was a driving force for much of it.<br /><br />Darlington was during the 1940's to the 1980's a sort of early version of Richard Dawkins, and was opposed for many years by JBS Haldane, who was a sort of early version of Stephen Jay Gould.  Many of the controversies, being rooted in deep-seated views of human nature,  have hardly changed.  There is the Marxist version of a faith in the malleability of man by wishful thinking, opposed by hard lessons drawn from science, evolutionary theory and the observation that man is a creature acting in accordance with hereditary behaviors which have developed differently in different races.  Not for Darlington the notion that race is a \\"social construct\\" or that IQ is a \\"reified\\" useless hypotheis, the same for all races.  He was a sociobiologist well before the term was invented.<br /><br />The first part of the book that deals with Darlingtons cytogenetics is not the easiest read, dealing as it does with a pretty arcane subject in perhaps a little too much detail, even for the informed reader.  The old controversies about such things as parsynapsis vs telosynapsis, are enfolded in a vocabulary that will be intimidating to many readers.  I wish, though, that he had covered in a little more detail the methods of cytogenetics, the stains used, the sample preparation methods, and so on.  Just how hard was it to prepare an informative experiment?  A little more about the influence of Darlington's cytological insights on the conventional modern practice of the art would have been welcome too.<br /><br />No matter--skip on to the major part of the book where Harman covers the course of the debate over the nature of man and the insights brought by an evolutionary perspective. The meat of the book is here.<br /><br />In his later years, as for all scientists who live a long time, the main developments in his science began to become too much for him--molecular biology, psychometrics, and a bevy of new techniques were to add much that he could appreciate, but could contribute very little.  Exploring the big picture, speculating, theorizing and publicizing became his game, and we are better off for it.<br /><br />Harman has done a splendid job in this biography--he writes clearly, and has a very good understanding of his subject.  It is based on exhaustive research and interviews and will be the definitive work for a long time.  The many pictures bring the story to life, and make for a lively read.

Dyson is an inventor and industrial designer who has taken his bagless vacuum cleaner from the garage to a huge enterprise.  I loved this story and wound up really admiring the man. His distinctive approach to industrial design, his perseverance and gutsy self confidence enabled him to show that even in the world of huge multinationals, with all their central research laboratories, there are still opportunities for the lone inventor to make it, big-time.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the part about the early development of the machine, in which he made something like one version per day for over three years, varying things one at a time, measuring everything to exhaustion, all the while sinking further and further into debt.  Edisonian it was, but sometimes that is the only way--the quest for the quick breakthrough emphasized by modern industrial managers can be a real obstacle to progress.  I've seen it at work first-hand.<br /><br />The book is rather lavishly produced with ten pages of glossy photos, many of them in color, supplemented by many sketches and drawings.  The big margins and the attractive typeface on acid-free paper combine to make a very pretty book, worth owning.<br /><br />This is the sort of book that once you put it down, you feel better about the world, the striving of man-the-builder, and realize that, even in England, things can get better.	2004-10-01

But still it fizzled.  I never really figured it out until I read this book, some fifty years too late.<br /><br />Jack Kelly is an entertaining writer, and knows how to research a topic such as the history of gunpowder to the point of near exhaustion.  For me, the central question raised by the book is the observation that while it was invented in China, they actually made little use of it outside of fireworks.  Why was it that the West took their invention, surrounded it with a steady stream of innovative developments in guns and organization, and competed in a steady diet of endless warfare to implement them on a large scale?  Kelly really never answers this question, but that is all right--this is not the sort of work that can authoritatively get at it.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the section on the development of the sources of saltpeter and the efforts to produce a pure and consistent product.  In an age before chemistry, the process developed only slowly, but develop it did.  Made from fermenting dung piles as a cottage industry, it was a costly bottleneck for centuries.<br /><br />Kelly traces how gunpowder and the development of processes for improving the strength and size of cannon interacted to produce a steady improvement in metallurgical science.  All sorts of spin-offs and scientific developments followed.  Few materials have had such a long period of development and use, so there are plenty of fascinating anecdotes and historical oddities for Kelly to relate.  And over and over again we learn how important to progress the simple act of measuring and recording the results of trials were.  An arty seat of the pants approach just wouldn't do the trick.<br /><br />The book has many illustrations that really helped in telling the story, and I much appreciated them.

It was one of the best things to happen to me as a boy.  I never started another one, and went on to become a scientist.<br /><br />It was the guy who figured out what killed the dinosaurs, Luis Alvarez, who said \\"I don't like to say bad things about paleontologists, but they're really not very good scientists. They're more like stamp collectors.\\"  He must have had Stephen Jay Gould in mind.<br /><br />The stamps Gould collects in this work for undergraduates are mostly very old, and can't go anywhere.  Nineteenth century suppositions about the connections of physical types to feeblemindedness and criminality, long discredited by modern scientific research, are here resurrected and their errors displayed with all the fondness of a philatelist contemplating an upside down airplane.  This stamp collector, though, is not content with just putting them into an album, but seems to want to persuade the reader that airplanes can't fly.<br /><br />His next stamp depicts the very first IQ test, printed up about a century ago.  This one seems to have the wrong number of perforations along its edge, and it is a little bit off-center.  The only possible conclusion is that all subsequent IQ tests must be incorrect too...<br /><br />Actually, the core of Gould's argument is really that the post office can't produce a perfect stamp because they have too much interest in delivering the mail.  Moreover, the post office cannot even price its stamps correctly because they belong to an immoral corrupt capitalist system-- the good guys like himself will eventually put it out of business once and for all, one undergraduate at a time.	2004-09-30

But this book is about his other love, the deciphering of the code that makes the human brain work.  There is nothing like a big, important puzzle to get the blood working, and mine was powerfully pulled along .  With the human genome project's sequencing of human DNA nearly completed, understanding the brain has got to be the most important scientific undertaking one can think of.  Hawkins easily persuades us that there is a burning need for a \\"top down\\" model for the brain that can play a role something analogous to the Central Dogma of molecular biology, which guides and organizes research, prioritizing the myriad of possible tasks into something like that required for the logistics of a conquering army's march through an alien land.<br /><br />He also persuaded me that he has some important insights of that model that I found tantalizing, new and exciting.  His central model concerns the role of the cortex in producing intelligence.  He makes the case for a central dogma he calls \\"the memory-prediction framework.\\"  This idea says that the cortex is a machine for making predictions for temporal sensory patterns based on memories of past patterns.  The prediction algorithm carried out in the cortex is the same for all of the senses of vision, touch, hearing, etc., which accounts for, among other things, the basic physiological uniformity of the cortex, and the plasticity of the brain in adapting to such problems as blindness or deafness.<br /><br />He argues that since the \\"clock\\" of the brain operates at a tick-rate on the order of 5 milli-seconds, and most of the functions of the brain (e. g. recognizing that a picture of a cat shows a cat) are carried out in less than 100 ticks.  From the time that light enters the eye, to the time it takes to signify recognition takes less than a second.  A computer would take billions of instruction steps, and even the fastest parallel computer available would not do it in less than millions of steps.  So the brain doesn't really \\"compute\\" the answer, it retrieves it from memory, which requires far fewer steps than the computation.  Sounds good to me.<br /><br />His explication of the memory-prediction framework is clear and accessible even to the uninitiated like me, though I found some of it in the middle pretty heavy going.  But this is something like reading Watson and Crick's paper on the structure of DNA.  The part about turning the diffraction diagram and other insights into a workable model was a little above my head, but I could still see the importance of the answer, and how it addressed the problem of replication and how it gave clues as to how to \\"read the genes.\\"  I can only grasp part of what Hawkins has done, and I can see that there is still a long way to go.

Here was a man that was not a cog in in some vast socio-economic machine, whose only desire is \\"to just get along.\\"  He was one of those who didn't experience the benefits of the coexistence of two cultures in one land, because one of them was politically and economically savaging the other.<br /><br />He did not have as his primary goal in life to accumulate the accouterments  of a materialistic civilization for himself, nor did he ever have a mortgage to pay.  He never owned a car.  He never formed a family.  He never knew such idiots who populate the safety committees of the industrial organizations in our own time, nor the phonies who infest our academies, longing for tenure.  He loved his culture, as it was, and resented outsiders who had only scorn for it.<br /><br />He was a leader of men, a man of action, a stickler for detail, who always knew what he wanted to accomplish.  His physical courage was unimaginable to most men, even to those of his own time and place.  His outstanding political skills and ability to do what was required to achieve the achievable was unmatched by any of the politicos and hotheads who surrounded him.<br /><br />His primary task in the rebellion was in counter-intelligence, which he came to see required the assassination of informants and torturers, detectives and G-men, and the higher-ups of the British intelligence services who directed it all and placed a price on his head. This culminated in a \\"Bloody Sunday\\" in which his men attacked the \\"Cairo Gang\\" in their lodgings, some still in their beds, killing 19 of them.  The Brits retaliated with a massacre of unarmed spectators at a football match, but ultimately it resulted in the opening of negotiations.  Incredibly, Collins was chosen to lead the negotiating team, and wound up across the table from Lloyd George, Austen Chamberlin, and Winston Churchill. He brought home an agreement for the Free State.<br /><br />Coogan tells his tale very thoroughly, at length, and with a satisfying balance of an attention to fact, considered speculation, and telling anecdote.  He is an accomplished historian who knows his subject intimately.  The author has written on the order of a dozen books on the modern history of Ireland, and is widely recognized for his authority, but not necessarily for an \\"objectivity\\" that belies the need for drawing lessons that should be the goal of any historian.<br /><br />The book is at times, perhaps, a little too detailed for the general reader, but it is something of a \\"definitive biography\\", so I can forgive him for this.  It is over 500 pages long with a very good bibliography, footnotes, and a terrific index.  The 17 pictures are glossy and clear and add a lot to the story.<br /><br />One of the most rewarding of things about reading this book is that it led me, I think, to a greater understanding of the events in Iraq, also suffering under an occupation by a hostile power, being fought by patriots and coreligionists in an urban setting, whose enemies from another land and religion label them terrorists and murderers.George, Austen Chamberlin, and Winston Churchill.

His many essays on the possibilities of gutsy achievement in large scale engineering is leavened by cautionary tales of overconfidence and hubris.  His stories are especially enlivened by his lacing some of his personal experiences with encountering the structures with erudite discussions of the technical challenges faced by the engineers and sometimes lyrical peans to the beauty of the artifacts they had created.<br /><br />I especially appreciated his chapter on his visit to the Three Gorges--a place I hope to visit soon.  And the one about London's  Millennium Bridge and the Wheel was tops too.<br /><br />On the other hand, it is apparent that the book is rather unevenly done. It is a collection of essays that do not tie together very well.  The chapter on fuel cells near the end of the book seems quite out of place and pedantic to boot.  And while the book has 28 illustrations, most of them are pretty cheesy--it really needs more and better pictures.<br /><br />But overall, I enjoyed the book and I'll be using it to enhance my visits to some of the same places that he describes so well.	2004-09-24

The article showed how methane can be generated from water and carbonate rock when the applied pressure is equal to that found in the mantle.<br /><br />Gold's book describes research done largely by Russians and Ukrainians on the origin of oil, which has been shamefully discounted and ignored in the West.  The Western dogma, he claims, is just another one of those things that nearly everyone believes, but is wrong.<br /><br />I love books like this.  It opens up a whole new world of important ideas and questions that need to be addressed, and make the scientific dogmatists who have \\"proved\\" their hypothesis by superficial reasoning from the most meager of data, coupled with proof by endless repetition, look as foolish as the geologists who rejected continental drift, or the idiots who still revere Freudian psychoanalysis.<br /><br />Evidence that he presents is pretty convincing and is a good example of how many diverse lines of evidence can make the convergence on the truth inevitable.  Many of the pieces of evidence were quite unknown to the formulators of the \\"fossil fuel\\" dogma who emphasize the limited reserves available for extraction.  The composition of the gas giant planets with their tremendous quantities of methane can be used to plausibly argue for primordial gas on earth as well.  The increasing realization among petroleum geologists that at least some petroleum reservoirs are being filled from below is startling news to many readers.  The biological \\"markers\\" seen in petroleum are introduced by bacteria to petroleum on its migration toward the surface provide an alternative and plausible explanation of the facts.  That Ukraine generates a third of its oil from reservoirs below all sedimentary rock is astounding.<br /><br />As a physicist at the corporate research labs of a major oil company, I've sat through many presentations of petroleum exploration experts with their tables of C13 data, interpreted as signs of age and origins of oil, and I even then recognized the signs of smoke and mirrors.  I only wish I'd read Gold earlier...<br /><br />Gold's book is also concerned with many other aspects of the consequences of the presence of biology deep within the earth that are just as intriguing.  That microbes exist deep in the earth and have a life style entirely independent from photosynthetic energy from the sun is an idea that is only now beginning to be accepted by some of the more daring Western petroleum engineers.  Russians have known this for more than fifty years.  The idea that better earthquake predictions can be made, and that fossil fuel reserves are much greater than publicized in the popular press, are big, important ideas that would have tremendous political impact if true.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed Gold's style of writing, which is clear and straightforward, and the story he tells is a very important one, deserving of much more attention and research.  The book has a gratifying number of illustrations and is well organized.  The notes give a good introduction to the scientific literature on the subject, but I think some criticism can be leveled at Gold for writing as though he had been a major discoverer of many of the pieces of evidence, when he is actually playing more of a role as a popularizer for the findings of the Russians and others.  But reviewers, and even popularizers, are not to be sneered at.  They play an important and honorable role in the progress of science--Gold does an outstanding job here.

The young Farley Mowat, returning disillusioned from the War in 1947 and thinking to become a biologist, joined with a taxonomist on a collecting \\"scientific\\" expedition into the Barren Lands of Northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  The headstrong 26 year old was improbably paired up with a disciplined naturalist of the old school, who killed and skinned every animal he could shoot, poison or trap.  After a while, Farley, having seen enough killing in the war, became disillusioned with this approach to appreciating the wonders of nature, and deserted his post in favor of exploring the largely uninhabited territory in the company of an Indian half-breed, Charles Schweder.  His real desire was to contact the \\"People of the Deer,\\"  the Imhalmiut.  These people came to be idealized in Farley's mind as a people \\"uncontaminated with the murderous aberrations of civilized man.\\"<br /><br />Mowat gives a clear picture of the hardships encountered by the few inhabitants of this harsh landscape.  By the time of the expedition, the Imhalmiut had dwindled to only a few scattered bands, having been nearly wiped out in a succession of epidemics.  Farley tells of the well-intended but sporadic and largely ineffectual aid given to them by the Canadian government and its minions, and how Schweder had been traumatized by his experience in a partially successful rescue attempt he had made the year previous.  His rescue of a six year old replacement for his child bride, dead of starvation,  presents the reader (and Mowat) with a thought- provoking moral dilemma.  So much for the myth of the noble savage...<br /><br />For me, though, the message of the book was how uncaring and ruthless \\"Mother Nature\\" really is, and how down and dirty a bare-handed struggle it is.  He, Thoreau-like, at one point meticulously gives a complete list of the things they chose to carry on their epic trip down an unmapped river system:  guns and ammo, flour, sugar, baking soda, canned food, gasoline and oil for their outboard motor, tarps and tents.  Even with all these products of Western technology, their trip was hair-raising and nearly disastrous.  And the bugs!<br /><br />For such a rough subject, this turns out to be an engrossing tale and hard to put down.  On the other hand, the map requires a magnifying glass to read and there are no illustrations.  I really appreciated, though, the last chapter, in which he follows up on the fate of the characters he encountered, giving the reader some \\"closure\\" as it is disgustingly called these days.<br /><br />I found it a little curious, though, that Mowat felt the need to apologize in a postscript for his use of some now politically incorrect words, such as Indian, half-breed, and Eskimo.  This is largely a story of the encounters of people with different cultures, of different races, viewed through eyes that are quite a bit more honest than is usually tolerated by the demagogues and girly-men of our sensitive time.their epic trip down an unmapped river system:  guns and ammo, flour, sugar, baking soda, canned food, gasoline and oil for their outboard motor, tarps and tents.

And I wondered about the other great extinctions, where even less was known.  Would it ever be possible to determine their causes, and their meaning for life on earth?<br />Well, now we know that the question of the dinosaurs's extinction has been answered to everyone's satisfactions, save that of a few cranky holdouts. It was a huge meteor, and the killing mechanisms are largely worked out. Now many of the scientists who worked so successfully on that problem have turned their attention to the other four great extinctions, using many of the same techniques and methods developed over the decades.<br />This book is about one of those men, who tells the story of the PT extinction of 250 million years ago from a personal point of view, with lots of well-explained science mixed together with an engrossing tale of personalities and adventures, hardships and triumphs tossed together into a most pleasing and engrossing way.  His struggle is an inspiring one, for it is a most human tale of overcoming obstacles in a determined way, showing the failures as well as the times when chance and persistence overcame paltry funding, errors and muddles.<br />Ward makes a convincing case that the PT extinction is well on its way to being solved, though much clearly remains to be done before a scientific consensus is reliably established.  But more than that, he has written a terrific thoughtful chapter in which he comes to speculate on the implications for these events.  He persuasively argues that life on earth is fragile, at the mercy of chance events which we are only beginning to understand.  Much like our own life...<br />But for me, the main message of the book is that a few dozen scientists, armed with the tools of thousands of their fellows, can tackle the big questions which seemed so out of reach only a few mere decades ago.seemed so out of reach only a few mere decades ago.	2004-04-09

He was a law-giver who essentially outlawed the culture he came from--transforming it from a Scots-like clan of cattle rustlers and raiders, to a monolithic, highly disciplined cavalry of conquerers.  He devised entirely new military tactics that were as successful against the cities of the Chinese as against the armored knights of the West.  And they started out as a people, he claims,  who did not even know how to weave cloth!<br />Weatherford here takes up the challenge of accenting the positive impact of his brutal conquests.  Among other things he makes the case for his setting the West up for the Renaissance, the introduction of paper money, the postal system, Religious tolerance, and new vegetables.  He bases much of this on new scholarship, rather than the hysterical propaganda of the aristocrats whom he threatened.  Partly based on the mysterious &quot;Secret History of the Mongols,&quot; the author's own travels in Mongolia, and contacts with Mongolian revivalists, he makes this bit of history accessible even to the most prejudiced reader.<br />Strangely omitted, though, is the fascinating tale that the geneticists have discovered about his Y chromosome, which appears to show that he might just have been the most prolific lover in the last couple of millennia!  Too recent, maybe.<br />One of the remarkable features of his style was that he hated the elite and the aristocrats, and slaughtered as many as he could.  He loved the professional men, the teachers and doctors, and especially the craftsmen and engineers, and did not even tax them.  My kinda guy!<br />Weatherford's style of writing is lively and easy to read.  The maps are just detailed enough to be informative without overburdening the reader in detail.  This is not an exhaustive account of every battle, every city destroyed, which would be mind-numbing history as usually written, but rather a wide survey of events and their impact on the world to come.  And I especially enjoyed his description of the military tactics employed by the cavalry, and his use of siege engines and gunpowder, which would be new to most readers.<br /> Perhaps one of his greatest inventions, though, is that of diplomatic immunity.  Any city, and there were several, who murdered or mutilated his envoys as a method of rejecting his terms of surrender, would be ruthlessly razed and the inhabitants slaughtered.  Even in those days, the word got around...<br />This is quite a tale, well told.ed, which would be mind-numbing history as usually written, but rather a wide survey of events and their impact on the world to come.

There are plenty of new ideas here, coupled with a rather informative short course on the twentieth century's additions to Darwin's theory of evolution.<br />This is not a dry recitation of the facts, by any means.  It contains his personal story of unraveling some of these puzzles himself, told in an a lively and amusing manner, sure to hold the reader's interest.  There are history lessons, such as the one about the lamentable foul-ups of the microscopists trying to count the chromosomes. And Sykes tale of observing his own Y chromosome, carrying out the manipulations with his own hands, is described in some detail.  There are stories about his coworkers, including the giant William Hamilton, who probably is second only to Darwin in developing the theory of evolution.  But mostly it is the story of the application of modern genetics to the varied populations of the world, the story of their migrations and conquests, and the struggle of the Y chromosome to survive.<br />Sykes' distinct approach is to apply some relatively simple molecular probes to Y chromosomes obtained from many individuals in a variety of populations on a fairly big scale, rather than the other important task, carried on by a myriad of scientists, of trying to understand all the biological minutiae of a single prototypical human.<br />His finding the Y chromosome inherited today by about 500,000 descendants of the founder of the MacDonald, MacDougalls and the MacAlisters Clans is quite fun to read, and the similar tale of his discovering the Sykes clan reveals something about how curiosity driven science can be so deeply satisfying.  The stories of the Vikings, the Polynesians, the Great Khan, and conquest by the Spaniards in South America are all covered here and the new insights revealed by their Y chromosomes gives a tantalizing glimpse of those still to come from other parts of the world.  I can't wait.<br />Probably most unusual for a book of this sort, is that Sykes, a distinguished scientist, lays on some pretty far out, half-baked, probably wrong, but testable ideas about such things as the origin of homosexuality, the war between the sexes from the perspective of the Y and mitochondrial chromosomes, and even the possible future course of the evolution of the Y to its ultimate demise.  This is a refreshing contrast to the plodding certainties of the refereed publications of the academics, hedged about with all the required caveats and cautions.  In spite of his sometimes over-anthropomorphized chromosomes, this is an entertaining read, rewarding to readers yearning to understand the human beast.d the new insights revealed by their Y chromosomes gives a tantalizing glimpse of those still to come from other parts of the world.

He was one of the primary movers of the scientific world of the Victorian era, and much can be learned of the development of the physical sciences through a study of his methods, personal interactions, and achievements.<br />Thomson was one of the dozen or so illustrious men, almost entirely British, Scottish, German and French, who developed the central ideas of thermodynamics and electromagnetism in the middle of the 19th century.  His particular contribution, among many, was to popularize and further develop the ideas of the Frenchman, Carnot, of the famous reversible heat engine.  This was to lead ultimately to the discovery of the absolute temperature scale, now named for him, and to entropy.  In electromagnetism, he stood between the non-mathematical insights of Faraday, and the highly mathematical formulation of Maxwell and Heaviside, which has changed little in its fundamental approach, and is still taught to sophomores today.  In fact, he and a friend wrote the first recognizable classical physics textbook for undergraduates.  And he played a big role as a consultant/inventor for the first transatlantic telegraph cable, a story well told here and in Gordon's recent &quot;Thread Across the Ocean.&quot;<br />Thomson was something of a prodigy, gathering honors and publications at a very young age, but later in life his productivity fell off into an idosyncratic crankiness.  His required approach to problems was to devise mechanical analogs for phenomena, which turned out to be too limited to arrive at a full field theory of electromagnetism and atomism, neither of which he ever accepted fully.  He was a true believer in the ether, but was never able to use it to produce a fruitful alternative to Maxwell's E&amp;M or kinetic theory.<br />It was interesting for me to note the obvious parallels between his life-arc and that of Einstein.  Einstein was also unable to fully participate in the later scientific developments in quantum mechanics because of a prejudice or block similar to Thomson's requirement for a mechanical model.  And then Kelvin spent an inordinate amount of energy in developing an improved ship's compass (a profitable success), while Einstein tried mightily (but unsuccessfully) to improve the refrigerator.  Einstein killed Kelvin's ether by ignoring it, but was in turn killed by his insistence that &quot;God doesn't play with dice.&quot;<br />Lindley has written a well-researched but entertaining and well written book.  The illustrations are a good addition, not seen before by me.  A scientist himself, he is well equipped to understand the science of the times, and is unerring and enthusiastic for his subject.

Olson has such a determinedly preachy style of writing about an important topic of science, race, that if cannot help but flat out insult and nauseate all but the most determined or naive readers.<br />His central thesis is that race is not a biological construct (whatever that means), that there is no biological reality (whatever that means) to it, and thinking the contrary is the root cause of genocidal wars and all sorts of evil things.  And did you know we are 99% chimpanzees too?  And besides, race is only skin deep, and under our skin we are all alike...<br />This is a book filled with the superficial propaganda of the multiculturalists, longing for peace through diversity, and thoroughly indoctrinated with the impotent ideology of the wishful dreamers.  Race doesn't matter?  Try telling that to the participants in a race war, or the parents of marriage age children, or Jews.  If race doesn't matter, why does he think intermarriage is a good thing?  If race is merely a &quot;social construct&quot;  why are most of the new things about race being discovered in the laboratory, not by poll-takers and pundits?<br />The science of race is rapidly progressing, using all sorts of exciting new tools and methods, with cooperative efforts expanding all across the world, and is being driven by new ideas and objectives impossible to even conceive of testing only a few decades ago.  This is an amazing scientific endeavor, with immense importance for the proper understanding of man.  Little of the excitement of this endeavor is communicated in the book, only the sound of an ax-grinding.	2004-03-22

Rather than making an honest effort at discovering a representative list of the 100 scientists who have made the genuinely great strides toward our understanding of our world, he has produced a bogus list that the fearful ladies of the pedagogical world will thrust on our gullible youth, the better to keep them from having the dangerous thought that white European males have dominated the sciences.<br />How else to explain the presence of George Washington Carver, whose claim to fame was that he was \\"born a slave\\" in 1866.  Really.  The Emancipation Proclamation was effective in 1863, the 13th amendment passed in 1865, and the Civil War ended in 1866.  Is this a stretcher?  And was he really an accomplished scientist?  Ha!  PC follies for the gullible.<br />And in the list we find Sigmund Freud, of all people!  Freud was not even a scientist. He never produced any data that could be statistically analyzed, graphed, or replicated.  Only introspective self-delusions were his stock in trade.  His theories on human psychology are entirely discredited today--who among us believes that a boy's love for his mother is sexual, and that little girls are messed up because they mourn for what is missing between their legs?  Why him, but not Nostradamus or Madam Blavatsky, or the inventor of homeopathy, whoever he is?<br />To include Margaret Mead here is absurd in light of her shoddy work in Samoa, devastatingly discredited by Derek Freeman.  Her \\"work,\\" mostly printed up in Redbook, a popular magazine for ladies, has sunk into a well deserved oblivion.<br />The list includes eleven women, who range from comparatively minor figures to relative nonentities, and are clearly out of their league.  Science has been an overwhelmingly white male enterprise, and it is dishonest to pretend otherwise.<br />And not to include Robert Koch, Willard Gibbs, E. O. Wilson, R. A.

Other historians of technology would have a list that would only partially overlap this one to varying degrees.  It might be interesting to see other lists of this sort, and to be able to examine their pros and cons.  But it appears, unhappily, that this volume is meant more to entertain us, than it is to provide the best of all possible lists.<br />The inventions cited range from the prehistoric to the latter half of the twentieth century.  They concentrate, it seems, more on inventions that require some sort of mechanical embodiment, leaving out any that deal with compositions of matter, with the lone exception of paint.  Thus he ignores bakelite, polyethylene, and other plastics which have transformed our century.  And also he forgets the invention of bronze, iron, steel, ceramics and clear glass.  Chemical inventions such as tanning, Haber's nitrogen fixation, electrolysis, and other synthetic methods are ignored.  He forgets soap, and antisepsis.<br />Cloth and rope are not here.  Nor are the crops or the inventions of agriculture included:  hay and wheat, all methods for the preservation of food, fertilizer, domestication of animals, methods for breeding animals and plants, irrigation.  These are the basic inventions that moved us from hunter-gatherers to agriculturalists, and would seem to belong in a list that includes the plow and the wheel.<br />There is also, it appears to this reader, a distasteful pre-occupation with weapons of war:  the tank, submarine, nuclear weapon, bow and arrow,  gunpowder, pistol, rifle, cannon, rocket, barbed wire, dynamite, radar are all given.  The spear, atlatl, personal armor, pike, trebuchet, machine gun and land mine are sundry examples of man's deviousness and ingenuity in the killing arts which might just as well have been included.<br />The methods used for the selection, and the apparently intentional ignoring of entire fields of innovation, is not discussed.  No bibliography nor acknowledgements of previous attempts along these lines are provided either.<br />Philbin's greatest omission,though, is that he forgot to include the invention of the scientific method, used as a basis for many of the inventions he does list.  This too, together with the invention of logic, geometry and mathematics, is certainly at least on a par with the VCR!  Financial innovations, as well as any business oriented methods are left out, as is the Web, ebay and Amazon!<br />The book is lavishly illustrated with many diagrams and excerpts from the patent literature, and is thought provoking at times, but on the whole is rather inadequate to the task, I think.

I found it to be a powerful influence on my life, probably more than any single other book I have read.<br />I recognize as well as anyone its shortcomings and imperfections, but see through them to a powerful message that has been a rock for me.  It is something like this:  the world is real, and your ideas about how it functions matter, and influence the sort of life you will live.  That heroes, producers and achievers are more worthy of admiration than victims;  that moochers and mystics, quacks and charlatans are only to be scorned;  that to believe in the salvation of a sky god is nothing but superstition; that a hard-headed, objective point of view is superior to a fuzzy sentimentality and that hard work is a virtue that eventually leads to a better life than one that concentrates on satisfying the whims and indulgences of the moment.<br />While Ayn Rand's prose style never approaches that of another hero of mine, H. L. Mencken, it is certainly respectable enough to produce a novel of great originality and is, for many people, very difficult to put down once well started.  It is well suited to her primary goal to communicate a coherent world view, an epistemology, and a derived ethic that can actually be lived.  A mathematician struggling after a theorem hardly uses humor as a tool, and Rand has no room here for it either.<br />As for Rand's analysis of Capitalism, I find it superior to Marx's.  But I know that economics is complicated, and hardly a science yet, so her appreciation of the laissez faire variety is probably a bit of an oversimplification.  And a naive libertarianism, much influenced by her objectivism, while hardly sweeping the world for now, has something to contribute too.  Her biggest failure to me, though, is the problem of race, which she never discusses.  It is no easy task to apply her approach to such a difficult problem, and I am not aware of any.  The alternative basis in a hard-headed sociobiology, though, would probably have been quite comfortable for her, had it been available then.<br />Rand's message is powerful and a positive contribution to the progress of the world.

He was a hard headed skeptic of the theological arts, but took an intense, scholarly interest in it, and it was a boon to the universe of thoughtful men when he decided to report back to them on what he found there.  The book he wrote will stand for a long while as the best of its kind--at once dispassionate and informative, with more than a little of his trademark wit thrown about with an undisguised glee.  His enthusiasm for his subject bubbles out all over the place.<br />The book begins with an imaginary story of how religion must have gotten started among the first primitive men.  It is a story well told, and reveals what Mencken imagines is at the root of men's heart much of the time--a fear of the unknown, and an understandable aspiration to master that fear by some means.  Then, very early on, the con men step in to utilize the fear for their own ends--power and cash.  To successfully create a job for himself, he proceeds to invent embellishments unintelligible to the poor saps, and rituals that only the initiated, such as himself, can perform.<br />The book continues with some comparative religion, basing most of it on what the Romans sneered at, that the Greeks made dramas about, what the Jews borrowed from the Babylonians, and what the Asiatics actually first dreamed up.  He finds in all of this the roots of Christianity, and especially the stuff that Christ had never thought of, which the theologians later added for the most practical of reasons.<br />His account of the early church and the evolution of the bibles is gratifying in its scholarship and clarity of description.  He makes the ancient theological quarrels come to life, imparting an understanding that is a valuable addition to any freethinker's equipment. Occasionally, the real Mencken peeks through, enlivening and enlightening as he goes.<br />The best part of the book, though, is when he shows how religion is inadequate for the job, and is in a full retreat before the onslaught of science and rational methods, leaving the truly civilized man with &quot; a way of facing the impenetrable dark that must engulf him in the end, as it engulfs the birds of the air and the protozoa in the sea ooze....not perhaps with complete serenity, but at least with dignity, calm, a gallant spirit.&quot;reat before the onslaught of science and rational methods, leaving the truly civilized man with &quot; a way of facing the impenetrable dark that must engulf him in the end, as it engulfs the birds of the air and the protozoa in the sea ooze....not perhaps with complete serenity, but at least with dignity, calm, a gallant spirit.&quot;	2004-03-14

For a book about the modern wars of militias and warlords within failed states, its eloquence actually gets in the way of the message at times.  Occasionally one can even see that sometimes Ignatieff says something just because he has thought of an eloquent way of saying it.  Not that I am accusing him of insincerity, for he is not.  Nor that the book is without an honest message, for it has several.<br />The book is a sort of meditation on the nature of these &quot;modern wars&quot; that is colored much by his own personal experiences in several of them.  The observation that is central to the book is that diverse people (who are really much alike too) can fall into a state of viewing the &quot;other&quot; as the enemy when a state begins to fail to protect them, and anarchy looms.  In successful modern states, the protection is present, and the fiction that diverse people are underneath it all, the same, is maintained.<br />The book has a very intelligent treatment of the dilemma of the various aid agencies such as the Red Cross and the UN Peacekeepers in trying to ameliorate the effects of war, and maintain their credibility, while not prolonging it or even intensifying it.<br />On the other hand, the author is a little too reverent of Freudian and even Marxist ideas on the nature of man, both of whom have about zero credibility to the discerning reader.  His account of the &quot;Narcissism of Minor Differences&quot; is just so much hooey to me.  Ignatieff seems to be entirely uninformed of modern thinking on this problem, which goes by the name of evolutionary psychology, and to me, seems so much more insightful and informative.<br />The general problem of war is not treated here, only a particular form of it.  The wars that inform his thinking in this book are those in Angola, Lebanon, Ireland and, especially, Yugoslavia, with a few &quot;lessons&quot; from the holocaust thrown in.  There is not much in the way of systematic study, but rather a grab bag of ideas and anecdotal observations.

This is a hotly debated topic among a subset of historians, and has puzzled me for a long time.  Is it due to the geography and natural resources of the Isles, the character of its people, or was it just one of those accidents of history?  More than that, how do you properly formulate such a question, and what methods can be used to arrive at a sensible answer?<br />Hobsbawm is probably as well equipped as anyone to try to answer this question, and does a pretty good job of it, I think.  At least his method, to concentrate on the antecedent macro-economic setting, and to compare its more or less unique features with other competing regions, rather than such vague and elusive possibilities of a superior political system or a certain theological proclivity toward work or something, appears to be sound.  His focus seldom refers to personalities, nor, surprisingly, the technological inventions that were so important--he seems to assumes that they were made as a matter of course, given the business climate of the times.<br />The book covers much more than the industrial revolution-- it carries the narrative into the last half of the twentieth century, and covers the same ground in Wales and Scotland, too.  His writing style is a pleasure to read and the book is accompanied by 52 graphs in an appendix that brings some additional meat to the table.  This is quite possibly the best book around for understanding this critical period in the progress of man, and rewards time well spent.	2004-03-12

He was the guy who really got the study of the x-ray diffraction studies going, and showed  that the features seen were universal to a variety of different organisms, and therefore that it was an important scientific problem.  He showed that the structure was probably helical, got Rosilind Franklin started on the problem, and was the link from her to Watson and Crick, who finally made the famous model that shook the world.<br />This book, published fifty years after, fills in some of the details of the event, correcting and contesting some claims made by others who have written on it.  Some of his corrections are quite convincing.  For example, a claim was made in one of the books on this affair that his research group contained only one other female, implying that he was something of a misogynist, while a picture of his laboratory coworkers in the book is about half female.<br />The tension between him and Franklin is made much of in historical accounts, and Wilkins unflinchingly covers this, and is pretty hard on himself too.  The incident graphically shows how people from very different cultures (Franklin was a rich, pushy Jew) who are ostensibly working on a common goal can fail.  Diversity in a laboratory group is not always the asset that the universal dogma asserts.  His regrets and \\"could'a shoulda's\\" are revealing and even moving at times.<br />Another revelation in the book was his involvement in the Communist party, and his flirtation with Freudian psychology.  A scientific education unfortunately appears not to immunize one completely from quackery.<br />The thing I took away from the book is how the simple stories generated and perpetuated in the mass media and in historical accounts are almost always wrong in important ways.  Scientific discoveries and important inventions are almost always complicated events, only part of which is even known and understood by any single writer or even the actors involved.  But more than that, practically every writer has his prejudices and angles to massage.  Autobiographers are no exception to this, but Wilkins has added to our understanding, and should only be applauded for it.rong in important ways.

Not for Loyd the usual reportage from a remote news conference given by the \\"good guys\\" whose interest is primarily to promote the proper spin to events, fooling the world into believing in the goodness of his side.  He goes in harms way, crossing the borders between the good/bad guys and the other good/bad guys, revealing in all its detail the horrors of war.  It is a personal adventure, told from a first person point of view, and it is an eloquent, moving piece of journalism at its best.  One is reminded of another hero of the profession, Robert Fisk, who tells a similar tale of the war in Lebanon in \\"Pity the Nation.\\"<br />Both of these books are about what happens when a multicultural nation falls apart into its ethnic pieces, which get unscrambled in a horrific multisided civil war.  They show how ordinary people of different ethnicities and religions can live peacefully side by side for many years, with all the predictable compromises and legalities, intermarriages and friendships, then turn in a matter of months into communities at war, destroying everything that had been built up over the preceding decades.  Everything inevitably follows a repeating process that is very poorly understood from an objective or scientific point of view.<br />Explanations of the phenomenon abound, usually centered around a bankrupt and distorted variation of good guys vs. bad guys, which unfortunately goes nowhere in arriving at a true understanding of the phenomenon.  These explanations and rationalizations are actually a part of the phenomenon, and can hardly be accepted in any meaningful way.<br />What is needed is an underlying theory which can be used in a scientific way to form hypotheses and models, studied by statistical methods, and enable useful predictions and perhaps even preventative measures to be taken.  Is it possible to predict the \\"tipping point\\" where the transition to communal war occurs?  Is it possible to intervene in ways that don't make the problem worse?  These questions can only be asked in a meaningful way when men such as Loyd and Fisk have provided the crucial data and observations that others can utilize for a scientific approach to succeed.<br />In the meantime, these tragedies will continue to occur, the political charlatans will continue their spinning, historians will follow the leaders, and the outsiders point their fingers in the trials of the defeated.  The real message, though, for Americans and Europeans alike,  intent on promoting multicultural dreams through unconstrained immigration of other ethnicities, is to examine the possible outcomes, one of which is a nightmare.war occurs?

Quammen transports us into a world where interactions of animals in real ecological systems are the object of study, charming us into seeing its importance, and introducing us to the people who are working to advance our understanding of the natural world.<br />The central theme of the book is the importance that islands have played in this area of research, starting from the work of Darwin and Wallace, extending to the modern work of men such as E. O. Wilson, Macarthur, Simberloff, and Lovejoy.  What is revealed is a science progressing from anecdotes and scattered observations of curiosities to something with its own generalizations and laws that can be have an increasing certainty, backed by sound statistical studies, and that produces graphs and tables, equations, useful computer models and testable hypotheses.  The majesty of the process is astounding.<br />Quammen writes clearly and spares no effort to involve the reader, mixing a historical treatment of the process, interviews of the modern players, and his own thrilling explorations of the remote islands--he splendidly communicates his excitement and involvement.	2004-03-11

They were the transistor, the integrated circuit, and the polymerase chain reaction, PCR.  The transistor was invented jointly by three physicists, the integrated circuit by two engineers, and PCR by a single chemist.  Each of these inventions spawned literally thousands of others, enabling whole new industries that have changed human activities in fundamental ways that we still little understand and that are thrilling us still.<br />This is the story of the two engineers, Jack Kilby, a Kansan, and Robert Noyce, an Iowan, who together showed how to put all of the required components of an electrical circuit onto a single tiny piece of semiconductor.  This made possible, among other things,  the modern computer, GPS,  satellite communications, the internet, and the cell phone.<br />Kilby and Noyce are, Reid informs us, modest and accomplished men, whose fame will live forever--heroes and role models for those who dream of contributing to progress of the human race.  They are hardly household names like the currently fashionable politicos or movie, music and sports stars of the last ten minutes, and their reputations will struggle to be placed on the list of the great White men, so lately in retreat before the hucksters of multiculturalism, laboring mightily to promote the inventors of the traffic light, psychoanalysis,  and  peanut butter.  Their story needs to be told, monuments to them need to be erected, and their fame taught to our young.<br />Reid has done us a great service by telling the story so well, humanizing these heroes, and we are indebted to him.

Not for him the weary recounting of kings and battles, but rather the enjoyment of their art, a meditation on their language, and an appreciation of their myths.<br />I, a relative novice in the historical arts, mired in the contemporary dogmas of multiculturalism, gained something from this book.  It is that culture matters, and that not all cultures are equal at all times, for all times.  The Greeks brought some unique materials to the table of a progressing civilization, and it merits some study to determine what the threads running through it were.<br />Their much celebrated discoveries of the practice of democracy, their penchant for skepticism, and invention of a heartless logic, all influence our own version of civilization in ways that we are hardly aware of, and that our pedagogues of today would have you believe came from everywhere but the Greeks.<br />Yes, the Greeks enslaved others, they killed one another endlessly, loved carelessly, believed in the merits of their race, and excluded women from their political palavers.  But this is true of almost all civilizations everywhere at all times, and arguing that the Greeks are unworthy of our attention as a consequence, although fashionable in the current abominations of the academy, is as stupid as arguing that chemistry can be taught without acknowledging the centrality of the elements.<br />Cahill's sometimes excessively irreverent style, and his annoying attention to speculations on sexual matters, occasionally get in the way of his central message, but overall he has done a credible job here and produced a thought-provoking book that is worth reading, especially for multiculturalists with an open mind.	2004-02-27

Newton's phrase was that he was a &quot;man of strange, unsociable temper.&quot;  Hooke was, like many other early workers in the nascent sciences, jealous of others and argumentative about his contributions--modesty was not one of the virtues of such men in those days.<br />Hooke was the sort of man who over-reached and had too many balls in the air at once.  While he was a talented mechanic and experimenter, he took on such unrelated jobs as rebuilding London after the great fire.  He did enough for half a dozen great men, but never achieved the first rank of a Newton or a Watt, with one or two great discoveries to his credit.<br />Jardine's book is extremely thoroughly researched, detailed, with plenty of references and source notes.  There are lots of illustrations and portraits, and the book has a good index, and it is well organized.  I enjoyed the detective story that Jardine tells in which she appears to have identified the only extant portrait of Hooke.  Pretty convincing to me, and a real feather in her cap.<br />Sadly, however, she does not describe his scientific contributions very well or in as much detail as I would have liked.  Descriptions of his astronomical instruments and innovations are quite glossed over, impossible to understand.  In particular, for example, Hooke's attempt at the measurement of stellar parallax with a new zenith-pointing telescope, are entirely omitted from this work.  This story is entertainingly told in Hirshfeld's recent book &quot;Parallax&quot; and belongs here too as it reveals so much of his method of working and his weakness in the follow-through.<br />One astounding revelation Jardine makes is that Hooke arrived at the inverse square law of gravitation &quot;on the basis of experiments carried out with Henry Hunt...&quot; but does not describe the experiments at all.  How in the world could she omit any elaboration of this claim?  If the experiments were done, and did support an inverse square law, then Hooke would be rightfully granted credit for the discovery of the universal law of gravitation, which almost everyone grants to Newton because he later worked out the mathematics of elliptical orbits!<br />The book rather concentrates on his social affairs, and is filled with minutiae that while sometimes interesting, is a bit exhausting.  Just how much of the diary of the self-treatments of a hypochondriac can one stand to read?n inverse square law, then Hooke would be rightfully granted credit for the discovery of the universal law of gravitation, which almost everyone grants to Newton because he later worked out the mathematics of elliptical orbits!<br />The book rather concentrates on his social affairs, and is filled with minutiae that while sometimes interesting, is a bit exhausting.

It is an engrossing read, with lots of diversions and asides about the pranks of men in their prime.  On the whole it is clearly and cleverly written, and is, as they say, hard to put down.  I only wish his explanation of some of the details of the construction had been accompanied by a few more diagrams--occasionally they were a little obscure.  But no big deal, I don't intend to construct a dome--I was hugely entertained anyhow.<br />The people and their society are all brought to life in an engaging way and the interaction of the guilds, artists and patrons are seen to be only little changed in how such projects are sometimes brought together today.  The biggest difference may be in their absence of safety committees, OSHA, quality circles, ISO 9001, six sigmas, and other such impediments to achievement.<br />The dome itself was and is a staggering achievement in planning and execution, and would today, no doubt, engage more than a few computers and engineers for a couple of years before even a brick were laid.  How it was brought about by Brunelleschi in a time even before Newton, courses in statics and strength of materials, finite element analysis and all the rest, is a wonder to behold.  Giants with hearts of steel stalked the earth then.	2004-02-25

I would have thought, though, that even a book of this sort would provide at least some of the basics of coal chemistry, giving some information on the chemical nature and reactions of coal, and the number of Joules per kg, perhaps.  If you are looking for information of that sort, pass this jeremiad on by.  Its approach is that you don't need to understand a technology in order to appreciate or regulate it.<br />The book starts pretty well, giving some highlights of the history of coal's critical contributions to the industrial revolution, some of which will appeal even to those only tangentially concerned about the history of technology and how our present world came to be.  The tale of the resistance of Londoners to the use of more efficient stoves over the smoky fireplace with its visual appeal, now superseded by the TV, was fine to read.<br />Sorrowfully, there is not a word about the men who invented and developed the cast iron stove.  The trials and tribulations of the men who enabled the transition of charcoal to coal in the production of iron is not to be found here.  The important development of the coal-gas light, though described briefly, also totally neglects the chemistry, the men behind it and their heroic struggles.  The production of coke is briefly described, but there is not even the briefest mention of the coal tar and the role it played in the development of the chemical industry.  Although the transition of wood to coal burning locomotives is covered, the epical transition to the diesel is nowhere described.  The properties and uses of the ash produced when coal is burned is also essentially ignored in this essay of environmental fantasies.<br />The book does have for much of its length, a preoccupation with the smoke generated by burning coal, its noxiousness, and its mentions in the novels and memoirs of the times.  But where is the discussion of the characteristics of smoke, its particle size and densities, its variance with the type of coal and how it is burned?  Neglected again.  The possibility of the conversion of coal to a liquid petroleum-like fuel, and the enormous amount of research surrounding this possibility is likewise unknown to this author. Long wall mining techniques which have done so much to improve mine safety is not worth a mention either.<br />The author, an environmental solicitor and pleader, vaguely, feebly, and predictably argues for the complete replacement of coal by \\"renewable resources\\" such as solar power and windmills or something.  Nuclear power is, in keeping with the usual dogma, dismissed in a sentence or two.  The influence of this sort of discourse, while dominant for now among the media mongers and uplifters, will have little impact on our energy future.  Our civilization, born in Northern Europe, has a record of steady and continuous improvement, and has a future that will be again filled with surprises and glories through the efforts of heroic engineers.on of the characteristics of smoke, its particle size and densities, its variance with the type of coal and how it is burned?

It is the first of the dozen or so books that I have read by Mencken, but still my favorite.  Mencken has opened up a whole new world for me.  His irreverent debunking of favorite quacks have prompted me to look anew at a few of my own.  His incredible knowledge of the English language has raised the standards I expect others to meet, not a little.  And my vicarious contact with his world has made me work to improve my own.<br />Mencken, I am convinced, was a genius whose writings will live long even into the next century.  His writing is the only one that I feel compelled to read aloud to my wife, arms raised in excitement and for emphasis, daring her to contradict the glory of his prose.<br />What contemporary American writer can match his mastery? I've read a lot, but I can't give even an approximation.  His style is elegant, distinctively American, and a joy to read.  Something like listening to a singer who you know has an absolute control of her material, a voice that does exactly what she intends, and the aesthetic sense of an angel.	2004-02-12

Diamond's clearly stated thesis is that geography is the great determiner of human destiny, though, weirdly, it is left out of the title of the book.  The book actually has little to say about the three items of the title, but rather focuses on the natural resources available to different regions of the world, the animals that could be domesticated, and the possibilities for communicating with other adjacent cultures.  In line with the current passion for multiculturalism, he argues that the people involved are pretty much all equivalent, and that there are no important racial differences that need to be considered.<br />He dismisses the work of the psychometricians whose data, in spite of the taboos of our current state, reveal in hundreds of studies that people's intelligence vary by racial group.  He throws out this data, incredibly, based on his own assessments of personal experience with different peoples.  In fact, he baldly states his belief that stone age peoples such as New Guineans (whom he knows something about) are actually on average more intelligent than white Europeans.  One more example of introspective speculation and personal, anecdotal experience being being mistaken for hard data that can be replicated, graphed, statistically analyzed, and added to by studies with improved methodologies.<br />His attack on such an important question as IQ and the &quot;wealth of nations&quot; is weak,  unconvincing, unscholarly, colored by political correctness, and short.<br />In order to see the importance of geography and race, Diamond might have considered comparing the development over the last few hundred years of the peoples on the islands of Hispaniola and Iceland.  Try spending a couple of hours with your browser aimed at the CIA fact book, Google's pictures, and a few other readily available sources, then tell me why you think geography is the prime mover in the fate of nations!<br />His hopes of helping to see history become more scientific, argued in his last chapter, though, certainly is meritorious.  Really important questions about the history and destiny of man can and should be attacked by scientific methods, and perhaps Diamond's accretion of observations and speculations do serve as a sort of start, something like how alchemy started chemistry.in his last chapter, though, certainly is meritorious.

His justified fame is augmented with a laudable forthrightness, a rarity in this era of political correctness and fear of new scientifically grounded knowledge of the nature of the human beast. His honesty in confronting the meaning in the data and willingness to take on the theologians and the pseudo-scientific quacks who infest the departments of theology, anthropology, psychology and sociology of the academies is an inspiration to us all.<br />DNA is not just a book about genes and DNA.  It is about the essential nature of man himself, and the political controversies generated by the new insights.  Is is a tale of how this new science is finally vanquishing the old wives' tales, the mantras of the bishops, and the ignorance of the wishful thinkers.  Watson is a brilliant exponent of the hard truth over the comfortable conformity.<br />He was, though, I thought, a little hard on the eugenics movement of the early part of the last century. This is an idea that has never really been vanquished, nor should it be--man will (hopefully) never cease to try to improve himself and his race.  These men knew, as we must, that in these matters we are required to proceed in the absence of perfect information about the consequences of our natal policies.  In a hundred years our present ignorance will stand revealed, as will that  be two hundred years hence.  Should we rely on what we know now, or should we only rely on tradition, theologians, and mass-media induced hysteria in the meantime?<br />On race, Watson is courageous and not afraid to let the data take us where it will.  He believes that we have a lot to learn yet on this subject, and is not ready to be pushed around by the dogmatists who are only to willing to tell us how to think.  Good for him!<br />The book is an excellent read, and is very attractive in its layout and generous illustrations.  The writing style he uses is exceptionally clear--even conversational at times, navigating the space between talking down to the reader and an academic rant with great skill and sensitivity to his audience.

Enlightening in that lucidly explains the recent insights to human nature brought about by a scientific methodology unafraid of behavioral genetics.  Liberating in that it effortlessly overthrows generations of nonsense propagated by the theologians, psychologists ignorant of genetics or the scientific method, and the quacks who confuse introspective speculation with data.<br />Pinker is, with this book, an unequalled conduit of the scientific findings on human nature to the general public, and is entertaining to boot.  He easily communicates the meaning of unfamiliar concepts in a way that the reader comes away sure that he has not only learned something new, but something actually useful.  His interpretative skills are clarified by many illustrative examples and sometimes outrageous and deliciously iconoclastic truths.<br />I especially appreciated his &quot;naming names&quot; when he destroys the official dogmas of the politically correct establishment.  Not for him the passive voice of the cowardly academics, yearning for tenure.  If an establishment figure spouts nonsense, Pinker is ready and willing to jump on with both feet.  Refreshing.  I loved how he denounces the politically motivated &quot;Science for the People&quot; types such as Gould, Lewontin, Kamin and Rose as insufficiently hard headed in their choice between a false morality and a scientific truth.  And his destruction of the behaviorist school of psychology is a blast.  And psychoanalysis is, of course, beneath his contempt.<br />Perhaps the most interesting (to me) part of the book had to do with the theories and practices of child rearing, in which he persuasively proves that what most of us &quot;know&quot; is wrong.  Why the quality of research communicated so prodigiously by the media is so low is a mystery worth contemplating.  Wishful thinking run amok?<br />This is an important book that goes a long way toward extinguishing outmoded and unsupported beliefs about what the human beast is really all about, and will serve for a long time to help us all to become less encumbered by the baggage of the past and willing to improve the future.ed and unsupported beliefs about what the human beast is really all about, and will serve for a long time to help us all to become less encumbered by the baggage of the past and willing to improve the future.	2004-02-10

The latter portion of the book is pretty much a failure and adds little to the collected biographies.  It just is not possible to cover all that ground in so few pages, and the editors' wind up with a rather unpalatable recital.<br />The biographies themselves, usually consisting of a few paragraphs, do form a useful compendium, and many of them are well written and interesting.  However, some errors appear, as they almost inevitably must, in any work of this kind.  One whopper is their report that Carnot actually discovered the formula for the efficiency of an ideal heat engine.  While he knew that some formula involving temperature must exist, he did not know about absolute temperatures, and did not discover the formula.<br />The most offensive thing to me was the comparative space given to Freud and Jung (many paragraphs, plus portraits), neither of whom were scientists, and that given to William Shockley (two short paragraphs, no portrait), whose invention of the transistor changed our world so dramatically.  One sentence in Shockley's bio is about the transistor, and two slanderous ones on his contributions in genetics.  That's it.<br />Really, now.  Jung's psychological system included astrology, spiritualism, and various types of ESP.  His totally bogus notion of synchronicity is actually anti-scientific.  Why is he here, while Madam Blavatsky is not?<br />Farnesworth, who invented TV, is entirely omitted from the compilation, which is absolutely disgraceful.  And to forget Jack Kilby, inventor of the integrated circuit, is careless.  The inclusion of Spinoza and Wittgenstein who were philosophers, and definitely not scientists, can only be described as an error. And including Hahnemann, the quack that invented homeopathy, is ludicrous.	2004-02-02

Using interviews of these folks is a refreshing change from the treatment usually accorded them--by reading their words directly a more honest appreciation of their motives and actions can be gained than by a hundred articles by members of the press whose clear intent is to marginalize and demonize them.  The people interviewed come across as intelligent and thoughtful, and they have not been afraid to approach questions of race with honesty and a hardness that is rarely expressed publicly. They are not put off by the taboos of a larger society that is intent on committing racial suicide through a multicultural fantasy, and the description of their struggles is at once heart-warming and inspiring.	2004-02-01

Try looking up &quot;Jewish fundamentalism&quot; and contrasting the number of results with &quot;Islamic fundamentalism&quot; to get some idea of the magnitude of the bias in the media on this topic, so crucial to understanding the wars of our time.<br />Shahak and Mezvinsky have done us a great service by providing a coherent and well researched explanation of the ideologies of the fundamentalists in Israel, and how they influence the policies of the state.  The authors have, they explain, decided to use as their primary sources documents that are explicitly not written in English, and are therefore not only less accessible, but more honest than the sanitized works written for the gentiles.<br />Their contribution provides a powerful introduction to those who wish to gain some understanding of the real basis for the mess in the Middle East, which has finally dragged the US into a full scale war and occupation of Iraq.<br />The root cause of the conflict is that the fundamentalists, who are comprised of several different groups, mostly agree on their predestined occupation and settlement of the West Bank. They have managed to bring along the political world of the secularists, embodied in the Likud and Labor parties, who have provided the wherewithal to generate and support the settlements consistently over the years, whatever the stage of the &quot;peace process&quot; currently in vogue.<br />The book is clearly written, well organized, incredibly informative, and a must read for all Americans.	2004-01-30

In a field whose rivals such as theology, Marxism, deconstructionism, and such pseudo-sciences as psychoanalysis, which are governed by an unquenchable thirst for obscure jargon and a perverse interest in counter-intuitive concepts, Alcock shows that ordinary language can be used to explicate a powerful scientific theory that can be understood by anyone ready to reject the politically correct dogmas that are so forcefully projected by the mass media and the relics of the past, such as Stephen Jay Gould.<br />The book is well organized, and gives a clear picture of where the methods and findings of sociobiology stand today.  It covers many interesting case studies that are good examples showing how it is a scientific field, with all the trappings of fresh insights, tested hypotheses, voluminous data, clearly stated methods, and all the excitement that comes with a field progressing rapidly through the research of hundreds of honest investigators.<br />Alcock is perhaps at his strongest when he responds to the attacks on the field in a measured and powerful cadence of common sense.  Understanding human behavior is a field that everyone believes himself to be expert in, but is unfortunately filled with a baggage of historical nonsense and politically inspired biases.  It is at once &quot;the proper study of man&quot; and the playground of charlatans.  Seeing the progress that the science of sociobiology has made in the last thirty years, generates a feeling that must be much like that experienced by the people of the late 18th century, who saw chemistry replace alchemy.	2004-01-28

Unintended Consequences is an unusual book in that it is really three books in one, each reinforcing and complementing the other.  First of all it is a book about guns:  the technology, mechanics  and shooting characteristics of many sorts are described in loving detail.  The second book is about the history of the government's growing campaign to whittle away our Second Amendment rights, and about how the ATF entraps law abiding citizens into violating ever more arcane technicalities and regulations.  The third book is a novel about how a tiny group of citizens act to preserve their rights, and succeed by a series of plausible, ingenious and violent attacks on the sources of the problem.<br />The first two books were quite informative without being excessively technical, while the third with all the action was a real page turner.  Ross knows his stuff, and has produced a seminal work here that will help considerably to stiffen the movement to preserve traditional American values.  It is a terrific read!	2004-01-27

Was it a matter of access to natural resources, especially iron ore and coal?  Or more important was it the genius of the inventors who made more efficient and economic use of those resources?  Or was it the nature of the people themselves, a superior race to any other, imbued with the proper Christian values of hard work, honesty, and demonstrations of Calvanistic choseness?  No doubt it was a combination of all of these factors combined with singular historical accidents, all entangled in ways impossible to discern.  No matter--it makes for an exciting thing to contemplate, as well as temptations to draw lessons for our own time.<br />Whatley has done a credible job of examining all of these factors in a most scholarly and objective fashion, synthesizing all of the more recently collated statistics and economic indicators and deriving some new insights how the revolution occurred in Scotland.  He usefully compares the phenomenon with the antecedent events in England in order to make the analysis more reliable and pertinent.  His style is pretty much that of an economic historian, making for some tough going at times.  There is hardly a trace of the characteristics of the important personalities of the movers and shakers, which would make for a livelier read, perhaps.  But this is available in other sources, and within his own sort of approach carries it off well, making the book valuable to professionals, but accessible to the interested layman as well.	2004-01-27

The central event, around which the book is organized, is the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, celebrated throughout the Empire in 1897.  Full of pomp and circumstance of a proud nation, showing the world its power and glory, the celebration marks the pinnacle of its reach, though few sensed it at the time.<br />The Empire then included something like one quarter of the landmass of the earth, with a navy and merchant marine that dominated all of the oceans, and was without peer.  Its control of communication through its vast network of telegraph lines and underwater cables was unchallenged.  Britain was the main source of the industrial revolution of the 18th century, and its technology was an essential element to its domination of the less developed world.<br />In that Empire, 50 million British whites dominated 372 million people of all nationalities spread over an area some 90 times as great as the British Isles.  Morris concentrates his attention on the atmospherics of the time, and happily does not get bogged down in a pedantic recital of meaningless names and forgotten events.  This was quite a different sort of empire from the present day American effort and was probably more moral to boot.<br />The Brits had no notion of spreading democracy as our present satraps pretend, but rather were more interested in opening up markets for the factories at home, encouraging emigration of the less fortunate citizens, and spreading the gospel among the heathens provided an important moral impetus.  The American neo-cons, on the other hand, have no interest in spreading Christianity, and are more interested in attacking the \\"fundamentalists\\" of other faiths.  And they are content to see our factories shuttered and the jobs shipped overseas, and favor open borders at home.<br />Morris does an excellent job in his lively writing style describing the times. The book is rather lavishly illustrated, and it is certainly thought-provoking for anyone contemplating the imbecilities of the current scene.r />Morris does an excellent job in his lively writing style describing the times.

The world got smaller:  markets became more efficient and larger and  diplomats had to respond to crises in real time.  Journalists had to adapt and organize syndicates for gathering and sharing information.  Codes and ciphers increased in importance and commercial value while governments futilely tried to control and restrict their use.  All of these things are as familiar to us, as it was to the Victorians.<br />Sandage has done a credible job in researching the parallels and tells the story with plenty of amusing asides and anecdotes, making for an easy read.  The stories about how the telegraph was used in affairs of the heart, and the ingenuity of criminals to find innovative methods of practicing their craft shows one more time that there is little really new under the sun.	2004-01-24

The story is one of the courage and persistence of its director-in-charge, Cyrus Field, born in 1819 to a prominent family of Massachusetts.  Cyrus began the charge to span the ocean when he was only 33 years old, and after several attempts, finally managed to overcome all obstacles 14 years later.  The story that unfolds is one that extolls the virtuous and honorable men who made it all happen, giants whose word was their bond.<br />Mr. Gordon tells the story with all the enthusiasm of a child, unsullied by any trace of a fashionable cynicism or awareness of the betrayals to come.  The book is nicely illustrated with lots of photos and diagrams that contribute mightily to the immediacy of reading it.<br />I especially enjoyed the chapter in which the final triumph occurs, and, I kid you not,  at one point actually had chills run along my spine. This is a story that will awe and inspire you.  Cynics and phonies need not apply.	2004-01-23

In spite of his heroic efforts, It took about 50 years for this to finally sink into the medical bureaucracy of the British navy, when the scourge was finally vanquished.<br />Well, the truth is a little more complex than that, and contains some pertinent lessons for our own time.  The trial involved only 12 men divided into 6 groups, two of whom got two oranges and a lemon while the others got various other remedies of current interest, including dilute sulfuric acid.  The fruit receivers got better, and the others did not.  This was the only real trial during the several centuries of extended sea voyages, and was not enough evidence to overcome the objections of amateur observers, anecdotal reports, quacks with their own pixie dust to sell, and the opinions of the committees of the connected.  Truth be told, the modest Scot did not really push the method for study hard enough, and complicated his message with speculation and caveats.  He was unable to harness the commercial motives of the right people to finally triumph in his own lifetime.  Even as late as our own Civil War, and in the concentration camps of the Boer War, tens of thousands continued to perish of scurvy.<br />Interestingly, one of the reasons for the failure, traced by the author, is the confusion of the terminology of the day, when &quot;lemon&quot; and &quot;lime&quot;  were terms used inconsistently and interchangeably, while their anti-scorbutic powers differed significantly.  One can easily sneer at the ignorance of the those times, but be startled to realize that the same sort of problem exists today in the multi-billion dollar controversy over asbestos, in which two sorts of minerals, comprising six distinct minerals with distinct chemical structures are all lumped together under the same term: asbestos.  Journalists and dwellers in the bowels of the EPA and OSHA are as indifferent to the distinction and the evidence for a great difference in the dangers inherent in each of them, as any committee of the Admiralty of Lind's day.<br />As far as the inadequacy of Lind's clinical trial, these problems of methodology have hardly gone away.  Spend a few hours researching the clinical data on the important problem of second hand cigarette smoke, and tremble before the power of the mass media and the disregard of the uplifters for real scientific data.<br />Harvey has chronicled the complexities of the discovery well, and his tale serves as a cautionary lesson for those interested in how the truth may finally come to prevail, even in our own time of a plethora of shoddy science, bureaucratic safety committees,  and dishonest journalism.in the bowels of the EPA and OSHA are as indifferent to the distinction and the evidence for a great difference in the dangers inherent in each of them, as any committee of the Admiralty of Lind's day.<br />As far as the inadequacy of Lind's clinical trial, these problems of methodology have hardly gone away.

Clear glass made such instruments as the microscope, the telescope, the barometer, and the various forms of chemical laboratory vessels possible and until the invention of transparent synthetic polymers, was just about the only material that could serve.<br /> Macfarlane and Martin ably examine the importance of the material in making possible the historical advances that were shaped by the availability of transparent glass, and convincingly show that it was well nigh essential, and we would still all be sitting around a campfire in a cave if someone had not had the good luck to discover it.<br />One of his more interesting theories is that the discovery really took hold because of the demand pull for it in house windows in cooler climes, and that this is why the industrial revolution had its origin in Northern Europe, rather than the Arab world with its predilection for cooling breezes.  More glass for windows means less expensive laboratory glassware and other scientific instruments.  Perhaps there is something to this, but I suspect there were some other factors at work as well.<br />This little book is an entertaining read for those interested in thinking about the broad forces that shaped our modern world and its technology.

He should also be of interest to those who want a concrete account of the benefits of  &quot;data-mining&quot; in which miscellaneous, disparate sources of information are aggregated into something which is tremendously useful.<br />Maury took crates of old ship logs, and extracted the data about weather and currents as a function of date and location, and produced ingenious maps of the sea that could be used to plot voyages that minimized the time of passage.  In the age of the American clipper ships, the time saved could be quite substantial, even amounting to as much as factor of two over the haphazard routes used by the intuitive captains of the day.<br />The reduction of the data and the production of the maps was carried out by only a handful of men at the U.S. Naval Observatory, but produced tremendous economic advantages to those who used them.  They were quickly adopted by the merchant marine, and by cleverly requiring the recipients of the latest maps to turn over to him logs taken in a standard format, he was able to gather tons of new data for ever-improving successive maps.  Maury also discovered the feasibility for the route of the first transatlantic cable, and fought to establish the first weather bureau in the US.<br />He also brought about the convening of a Brussels Marine meteorology Conference in 1853 that was attended by nine countries and resulted in the adoption of a uniform method of gathering and disseminating the information among the world.  Not bad for a simple Lieutenant!  His quarrels with the jealous Joseph Henry (of electromagnetic induction fame) and others of his ilk are instructive to those interested in stories of how pettiness and obstructionism of powerful men can be overcome by men of true ability.<br />This story is well researched and ably told by Mr. Hearn, and is another exciting adventure of the heroes who made the industrial revolution.ld by Mr. Hearn, and is another exciting adventure of the heroes who made the industrial revolution.	2004-01-19

These three titans brought a laboratory curiosity, a few patents, and not enough capital, to effect the dramatic improvements in the utilization of fossil energy to replace the efforts of slaves, near slaves, and animals, and to make life better for us all.<br />We have Edison, who started it all with his improved dynamo and the electric lighting system;  Tesla and his crucial AC electric motor; Westinghouse who had the business insight and technical acumen to pursue the alternating current.  Geniuses, yes.  But of a very different sort.<br />Jonnes does an outstanding job of portraying the times, and the interaction of the approaches to solving problems that each of these heroes had.  So different, so complementary and so effective.  There was nothing else like it anywhere on earth.<br />I suppose anyone reading this review has read a bit about Edison and the light, Tesla and his eccentricities, and Westinghouse and his devotion to his workers.  The tale of the Niagra generators and the first long distance transport of electrical power will probably be new to you, and it is a story well-told.<br />But Jonnes has an awful lot to add to the usual stuff.  She communicates the downright excitement of it all, the delicious discoveries of the new, and the suspense of the disasters to be overcome.  This is no Ph.

Watt invented the improved steam engine that revolutionized the world.  I can't think of any other biography written by such a great man, about such a great man, possibly excepting the Gospel of Mark.<br />Carnegie's description of Watt's life is reverent almost to the point of unseemly hero-worship, but is laced with some most interesting insights into his own psyche and personal history.  Watt, according to this account, was a giant to his contemporaries, not only for his technological accomplishments, but also because of his sweet and loyal disposition.  I'm sure that Carnegie saw parallels there too.  Although the language that Carnegie uses can seem archaic at times, the book is quite enjoyable:  inspiring, even.<br />His description of Watt's inventions and the technical insights required to achieve them are lucidly explained in the book, and it is clear that Carnegie was no mere business tycoon.  Even his explanation of latent heat is clear and insightful, and a delight to read.  When he describes the business relationship between Watt and his partner Boulton, one learns something about the goodness in them both, unqualified and complete.	2004-01-15

Carnegie's father was put out of work by the automation of the knitting machines and defeated utterly, while the young immigrant who started in the most menial of jobs, progressed rapidly by his genius for hard work and risk-taking into upper management of the Pennsylvania railroad.<br />Parlaying what is today called insider trading into a modest fortune, he grew it into a vast fortune in the steel industry.  Often reviled as a \\"robber baron,\\" he then gave it all away in a philanthropic orgy of building public libraries for worthy communities.<br />Krass's task is to humanize the giant, and he doesn't settle for a simple-minded caricature of the ruthless, money grubbing capitalist.  He very successfully portrays the man as a whole, with all the attendant contradictions of any man, and follows the evidence where it leads, in the spirit of an honest biographer.  While he doesn't gloss over the cruel and difficult struggles to get the most out of his workers for the least pay, Krass shows the other side of a loyal friend and faithful family man, with high ideals and aspirations for the betterment of mankind.<br />Krass has given us a well researched book, an exemplar of the best in biography, and is a captivating tale of a time when giants populated the world.	2004-01-15

Although the central protagonists, the women in leadership positions, left relatively small amounts of material behind in the way of personal papers and memorabilia that are the usual primary sources for real historians, Jeansonne appears to have made good use of what is available, and has managed to put up a respectable effort.<br />The amazing thing revealed in the book to me, was that that the opposition was so strong and the organizations were so large, putting to shame the present paltry efforts against the Gulf wars.  The currently held notion that WWII was universally believed to be a &quot;good war&quot; and that our alliance with Stalin was approved of by all, is shown to be wrong--it was opposed by an awful lot of Americans.<br />Jeansonne's treatment goes a bit overboard in ascribing the most nefarious motives to their opposition--spanning the spectrum from anti-semitism to traitorous Nazism all the way to muddle-headed feminist sentimentality.  Mostly he emphasized the first of these motives.  It seems that anybody that pointed out that the Jews were in favor of an American alliance with John Bull  and Uncle Joe against Germany, which was the truth after all, has to be tarred, as Lindbergh was, as a &quot;rabid&quot; or &quot;ferocious&quot; anti-semite, or, all too often, as a &quot;bigot&quot;.  These terms would be marked as trite and overused had the book been written as a term paper in freshman English class.<br />Jeansonne, self-described in the text as a Jew, married to a theologian, is attracted to a bogus, essentially data-free Freudian analysis of pathological personalities which intrudes too frequently in his account and weakens the book considerably.<br />The lesson that he draws from this episode of our history, interpreted in the light of present mythologies, has to do with that never-ending question of the origins of anti-semitism, and is amazingly attributed by the author to &quot;anxiety&quot; and &quot;nervousness&quot; among the afflicted.  A simple conflict of interest between the Americans and Jews, it seems to me, is a much more reasonable, less pseudo-psychological, explanation.  His remarks on present efforts to abolish anti-semitism,  showing the utter disutility of providing more information on Judaism to Gentiles, and the current fad for &quot;diversity&quot; courses in our schools, though, seems quite on the mark.with that never-ending question of the origins of anti-semitism, and is amazingly attributed by the author to &quot;anxiety&quot; and &quot;nervousness&quot; among the afflicted.

Eysenck has done an outstanding job in this book in showing not only how unscientific and wrong it is, but goes further to describe the great harm that his ideas have inflicted on Western society.<br />Psychoanalysis is two things:  a theory of psychology, dealing with memory, personality and childhood development; and a method for treatment of certain types of mental illness such as neuroses and depression.  As a theory of psychology, it has failed because its basic assumptions are now known to be incorrect, and because of its use of unscientific modes of establishing and analyzing factual materials.  As a treatment, it has failed because of its very frequently noted propensity for making patients worse.  Its sexual interpretation of physical symptoms, such as a cough being a \\"love song,\\" or bedwetting being caused by masturbation, are absurdities that only perverts can believe.<br />Eysenck's critique is truly devastating for a modern reader to encounter, and one can only wonder why Freud's ideas have had such an impact on the popular imagination.  Eysenck's lucidly expressed explanation is that the answer lies in the ancient human desire to get something for nothing.  Freudian methods can obtain theories without having to laboriously obtain reliable facts.  Non-scientific thinkers, including literary authors, new agers, pseudo-psychologists, social workers and pedagogues, whose hunger for explanations exceeds their common sense, mistake idle speculation for \\"insight,\\" and lamentably fall all too easily for humbug.<br />The author's interpretation of the root causes of Freud's errors and deceptions are actually, to me, a bit on the generous side.  He sees them as compounded of ignorance, an erotic mode of thinking, laziness, cocain, and a desire to be the heroic leader of a cult-like movement.

Segerstrale's scholarly, exhaustive work in documenting this debate between the scientists and the politically correct (some of whom were also scientists) is enlivened by her many interviews with the protagonists, some of whom  still bear the scars of battle.<br />Although she is at some pains to appear to be neutral on the debate, it is impossible for her to hide her true evaluation, that the sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists have carried the field, and the reactionary naysayers have been sent to slink away into a deserved obscurity. This is a cautionary tale of how scientific debates that involve human nature inevitably spill into debates about the nature of the scientific process, and quickly involve the ideological pomposities of deconstructionism, feminism, theology, Marxism, and other such fashionable quackeries.<br />One thing Segerstrale omits that seems significant to me is that the antagonists to the sociobiologists, (for example, Gould, Lewontin, Lerner, Kamin, Gottlieb, and Rose) were mostly Jews with an identifiable Jewish/Marxist agenda.  The champions of sociobiology are, mostly, not.  The debate has a definite ethnic tint to it...	2004-01-09

He correctly sees that the welfare state has now become the transformative force throughout the West, using its powerful coercive tools of affirmative action, the school system,  and the penal code to force all white European societies to strive toward a sort of utopian multicultural society, where &quot;we all just get along.&quot;<br />After giving many examples illustrating the trends, he launches into his explanation.  As far as I can make out, his argument is that secularism has weakened Protestantism, with all its rituals of guilt, penance and salvation, which, to satisfy our innate psychological imperitives, was transformed into a public expression of expunging our historical guilts with charitable acts toward the unfortunates of the third world--especially by letting them into our territories where they have full access to the cash in our welfare system.<br />The truth of his observations on the prevalent trends is clear to anyone who reads a newspaper.<br />And, I suppose, there may be something to this theory, ably set forth in this work, but I think Mr. Gottfried is plain wrong about the cause of the trends.  My own inclination is to exonerate Protestants, and instead point the finger at the dominating force of the mass media, which Gottfried almost totally ignores.  I don't think he watches TV much.  The government, in realistic day to day terms, hardly ever talks to me, nor do the Protestant elite, but the media hammers away at me every day.<br />It seems to me that Kevin MacDonald has a much firmer grip on this.  The  cause is Jewish group solidarity,  the tool is the media that they dominate, and their goal is weakening the West.  They feel more safe and comfortable in a society with several other minoriities, rather than one with an overwhelmingly White, European culture.

The principle antidote to this pernicious doctrine is to recognize that excellence exists, and to celebrate the undeniable fact of inequality in achievement that have enabled some to enrich us all. While we are perhaps all born equal in some sense, it is really an equality of zeroes; for babies have no political rights--they don't vote or hold office, and their only talent is to find their mother's breast.  As individuals grow, the inequalities in them also inexorably grow, and differences become more and more obvious, sometimes even to the professors of sociology, anthropology and education.<br />Murray's methodology and the data he uses and shows us in all of its glorious detail are refreshingly straightforward to understand, and represents an advance in the application of historiometry that he can be proud of.  His finding about the dominance of Western European culture and white males in producing the inventions of the modern world is undeniable. The steam engine, transistor, and the scientific method were not discovered by the Yanomamo, Zulus or Eskimos. Sometimes it is not such a bad thing to state the obvious.<br />The important endeavor, as Murray emphasizes, is to try to understand the things that make for greatness.  What role is played by the accidents of history, the availability of minerals in our territories, the success of our warriors, minorities in our cities, and population genetics?  What causes the rise and fall of nations, and what can be done to be sure that our own culture of the West is preserved and protected against the eternal Barbarian at the gate?	2004-01-07

The vehicle is his scholarly examination of several intellectual movements: Freudian psychoanalysis, Boasian anthropology, the Frankfurt school, and marxist political ideology.  In a nutshell, he shows that each of these movements were unscientific frauds, each devised with an intention to undermine fundamental aspects of Western European culture.  Unfortunately for us, each of them were powerful movements with widespread acceptance during the twentieth century. Happily, though, each of them are now thoroughly discredited among all, excepting only the most self-deceptive of the unregenerate professors.<br />This is a powerful book, required reading for those who want to learn how American society actually works.  It shows how seemingly pure intellectual disputes about the grand questions of life are sometimes only instruments of competition for the evolutionary success of ethnic groups, and have little to do with science or any correspondence to reality.  They often involve charismatic leaders and group cohesion, involving banishment and punishments for dissenters--they function much like a cult.<br />His eye-opening discussion of the motivation of the Jews in their relentless campaign to change American immigration laws in 1965 provides an important insight to the present mania for multiculturalism.  His convincing argument is that Jews feel safer in a society in which they are only one of several competing minority groups, within a weakened European culture.  The effect of this change in the law in the US is enormous, and MacDonald is correct in claiming that the National Jewish organizations continue in their efforts to effect a fundamental change in American society.  And he rightfully exposes their hypocritical defense of Israel's immigration policies, which are hardly driven by a concern for greater diversity within their own land.<br />This book, while not quite a call to arms, is certainly a courageous call to wake-up!ncern for greater diversity within their own land.   <br />This book, while not quite a call to arms, is certainly a courageous call to wake-up!	2004-01-06

This happens very suddenly for him at age 49, causing great consternation and psychological turmoil at first, then changes his life forever.<br />After getting a couple of flyers in an airport, he reads them in the privacy of his hotel, knowing full well that the people who he valued most in his life would think that their content was gross craziness, if not downright unthinkable deviations.  When he recalled that the holocaust stories had not interested him in the first place,  he was amazed to be shocked  that he might conclude that they are not true.<br />He then describes how he went about a process of discovery that led him into an anguished state which puzzles him for the rest of his life:  how is it that the legend and its refutation mean so much more to him than to the people in his life, whose reactions range from indifference to hostility.  His answer, which doesn't really entirely satisfy him, is that he hates censorship and propaganda, and values the truth above everything else.<br />The style of this book is clean and spare, the story told direct from the heart.  I laughed and laughed with him, and felt a certain sympathy for going through something very like it myself.  It was easy to identify with him and this gem is well worth your time.

It differs from much of those theologically inclined texts in that it provides many architectural drawings and photos of important structures, which one can therefore examine for oneself, as Protestants are wont to do, rather than the digestions and ruminations of the verbally enchanted.  And it tells the story of what happened to those sites and structures since they were lately turned into a sacred museum, catering to the tourist trade with the inevitable tour-guides, preaching their morality tales.<br />What we learn is nothing short of astonishing.  We are told that among this trove  of hitherto forbidden documents left over from the war which describe in intimate detail the ever-mutating plans for the site, the work orders and bills of lading required for the construction and maintenance of its buildings and, especially, its crematories,  there has been no &quot;smoking gun&quot; found, no weapons of mass destruction, nothing at all persuasive that mass gassings took place here.<br />The blue-prints for the crematories do not show any convincing features of gas chambers, as the secularists found out long ago.  And the most fascinating feature of the book is that the authors do not even try to refute any of the heterodox claims.  There is nothing about blue stains, or the coke deliveries and muffle capacities that those sincere fellows so exhaustively tabulate.  The authors' method for dealing with heresy is to studiously ignore it.<br />Dwork and Van Pelt now make a case that much, if not most, of the purported gassings took place in a couple of farmhouses, for which there are no blue-prints, work orders, photographs or ruins that they could find, thus removing much of the power of the revisionists arguments, while contradicting the bulk of the &quot;eye-witness&quot; testimony that the orthodox propagandists have relied on so faithfully for decades past.<br />It does, however, reveal that the crematory/gas-chamber shown to those erstwhile visitors at the end of their tour as the real thing, was actually constructed after the war, much as the Sphinx in Las Vegas, which thrills the gamblers and prostitutes still.des past.<br />It does, however, reveal that the crematory/gas-chamber shown to those erstwhile visitors at the end of their tour as the real thing, was actually constructed after the war, much as the Sphinx in Las Vegas, which thrills the gamblers and prostitutes still.	2004-01-06

This book describes in exhausting detail how Americans, Jews and Gentile, have changed their perception over time of THE assumed genocide. Such a heterogeneous lot, needless to report, have reactions all over the ball-park.<br />More interestingly, he shows how the shifts that have occurred over time have been driven mostly by the concerns of national Jewish organizations to present an image to the gentiles that is deemed suitable for their current purposes.  Immediately after the war their concern was to present Jews as a successful heroic people, getting on with their lives, and turning the desert green.  Later on it was used by them to justify Israel's aggressive wars of occupation.  Then, in all the rage for identity politics, with its requisite displays of historical victimization, to out-victim every other ethnie. Finally, most despicably,  to &quot;draw lessons&quot; for school-children, suitable for bumper-stickers.<br />Novick's language describing all this is scholarly and temperate, but sometimes has a discernible edge.  However, his talent as an historian and writer is lamentably wasted.  He has produced, analogously speaking, a 400 page monograph on how the public's perception of alien abduction has changed since Goddard's invention of  rockets.  He describes how some have used their alien abduction to show how brave they are, surviving and going on with their lives.  Some have used it in a campaign to accuse the government of a cover-up in which all of the uninvolved, un-abducted are complicit.  And others have used it as a vehicle to go on the lecture circuit, write books of nonsense, and bring in some cash.<br />Perhaps most interesting is his discussion of the trend of organized Jewry toward making the holocaust a theological event, beyond any rational historical discussion or revision, as an ineffable, unique, illustration of the Jews' special relation to God.  He disapproves of this, of course, but recognizes its inevitability.<br />A remarkable omission in the book is his almost total neglect of the story of how the holocaust is used in the eternal efforts of lawyers and other greedy organization men to successfully extract billions of dollars from the gentiles, mostly enriching themselves, and sullying the memories of the victims.  Their essential argument:  my suffering is unique and therefore greater than yours, so give me some money--you'll feel better.  The silence around this phenomenon is thunderous.<br />One cannot be but a little disappointed in this otherwise praiseworthy effort to examine a modern delusion and its effects on the public psyche and politic. It would have been interesting to read here an account of how the legend itself has changed over the years, mostly due to the diligent efforts of real historians, who have gradually approached the truth with its revisions in the number of victims, the recognition that Dachau and Buchenwald were not extermination camps, and the discrediting of Simon Wiesenthal's hyperbolic tales of soap manufacture.an ineffable, unique, illustration of the Jews' special relation to God.

It is a wonderful illustration of how complex the history of an invention can be, how much of what you think you know is wrong and incomplete, and the role that repetition plays in forming your understanding of events that occurred a long time ago.  Shulman tells an exciting story here, and provides plenty of muscle in making the case that Curtiss not only made some outstanding contributions to early aviation, but in some ways eclipsed those of the secretive, monopolistic Wright brothers.<br />The patent fights between the Wrights, Curtiss and the rest of the early aviators is told with enough detail that you can get the sense of the times, without getting unnecessarily bogged down in a morass of detail.  While I appreciate the pioneering of the Wrights, the openness of Curtiss in sharing his patents and inventions seems quite admirable to me.<br />The part about Curtiss getting Langley's aerodrome flying was something entirely new to me, and the feud that the Wrights had with the Smithsonian over their cooperation with Curtiss, leading them to send their flyer to a British museum, a revelation.

It is a big book, richly filled with its illustrations and portraits, passionate for its subject, and a machine for readers wishing to be transported to another, most glorious, era.  The  time is the early industrial revolution in England and Scotland, and the men are the inventors and scientists, movers and shakers, who transformed England from a pastoral society into the cutting edge, world class industrial power.<br />Foremost among them were James Watt and his partner Matthew Boulton, masters of the dramatically improved steam engine, which was to be critical in the parade of innovations to come.  Erasmus Darwin and William Small, inventors of all sorts of peculiar things, performed the essential sociological act of keeping the circus of contacts  going and diplomatically holding the center.  And Priestly, discoverer of early chemical science, inventor of soda pop, makes his majestic performance in the drama.  And we can even behold the trapeze-work of such lesser known figures as Keir and Wedgewood,  who developed the business practices that finally got large scale industry churning.  Hardly making an appearance in this treatise are the churchmen, politicians, activists for the poor, and other clowns and negativists who impotently resisted them.<br />This book is not just about the innovations of these men, but about their character, philosophy, and political views during those tumultuous, even riotous times.  And characters they must have been.  In this book you'll discover all of the weaknesses and trivialities that made them human, and the romance and perseverance that made then heroes.  How I should like to have known them!<br />These men, and they were all men, we discover in Uglow's book, worked the rough edges of wealth and bankruptcy all their lives.

Having formerly lived in villages, surrounded by family, friends and familiars, they were shocked to discover an urban life where just about everyone they met were strangers not only to them, but to each other.  This required them to learn the stylized manners of an Emily Post (the part about Einstein encountering her book is hilarious), adopt polite speech, give up bargaining for fixed prices, and acquire the art of eating without crumbs gushing all over. This, according to Cuddihy, caused such a strain on their psyche, that they produced the \\"geniuses\\" displayed in the title in some sort of perverted, self-conscious retaliation.<br />This incredible thesis is made with all the seriousness of a professor, in the turgid prose of a good man, made nearly unintelligible by his contact with a Doctoral program of a major American university.  I don't know whether the thesis is really true, but he puts up an astonishing amount of evidence for it.<br />The style of the book reads as if it was out of the middle of the 19th century, rather than three quarters of the way through the twentieth, peppered as it is by untranslated quotes and words from French, Latin, German and Yiddish, as well of those recently coined by the pseudo-scientists and deconstructionists who infest every  university department of English today.  References to hundreds of obscure works abound, and an intimate knowledge of the intellectual curiosities of the early twentieth century is required.<br />It does make you wonder, though, about the greatness of the intellectual geniuses of the title.  Let see, Freud founded a school of psychoanalysis that believed that the love of little boys for their mothers is sexual, and little girls are screwed up because they mourn for what is missing between their legs.

Graf's book is an analysis of that work that especially concentrates on the portion that deals with the evidence for the industrial scale killing by gas, which is at the core of the holocaust myth.<br />After forthrightly stating that Hillberg's description of the persecution and deportations of the Jews during World War II is generally accepted, historically accurate and based on reliable sources, Graf energetically, and even with unseemly enthusiasm, tears apart the evidence he cites for the mass killings.<br />One surprising observation that he makes is that out of three volumes of 1351 pages, only 19 deal with the central fixture of the legend, the killings in gas chambers.  I found the portion of the book that deals with each of the eyewitnesses cited by Hillberg to be particularly persuasive.  He describes what each witness claimed according to Hillberg, and compared it to what else they claimed, not cited by Hillberg, thus utterly destroying their credibility.  His general argument against the reliability of eyewitness accounts, is common sense, but usually ignored in matters of theology.<br />Graf's destruction of Hillberg's treatment of the census data, statistics and demographics is also very persuasive and shows to any reader with even a modicum of discernment that Hillberg is an amateurish mountebank who works backwards from the desired answer to guesses and unreasonable assumptions.<br />This book is one that Hillberg and other tradesmen will never refute in any way.  They cannot afford to bring any attention to it.	2003-12-13

It effectively makes the case that the industrialized extermination of Jews by gassing never happened.<br />When the book was first published in 1976, the canonical story was that gassings even occurred in concentration camps, such as Dachau and Buchenwald in Germany.  Nowadays, of course, no historian believes this to be true, not even those at Vad Yashem in Israel.  Butz is partly responsible for this revision of the accepted story as well as for discrediting the tales of soap, lampshades and the &quot;6 million.&quot;<br />The scope and thoroughness with which Butz has researched this important historical question is impressive enough that its sale has actually been banned in several countries.
