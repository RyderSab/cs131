His background as Director of Option Strategy at Wheat, First Securities, and his long-time professional work with point & figure charts combine to give the seasoned investor an excellent playbook for approaching the stock market with enough education to come out a winner.  This is an excellent book not only for the work Dorsey has done with point and figure charts (his bread and butter), but also for the insights he gives on sector investing, relative strength, momentum, and options.   His discussion of the logic behind relative strength is second to none, and morphs nicely into sector rotation. This is the way the stock market basically works, and investors would do well to listen closely to Dorsey's well-reasoned explanations.  Point and figure charting is vastly superior to bar charting from the point of view of finding congestion (support and resistance) areas. If you can take the time to learn P&F charting, you will be rewarded by being able to observe the stock market from a much simpler and realistic standpoint.  Additionally, there is an extended discussion of options, with an emphasis on buying rather than selling, although he does acknowledge, \\"Time is the silent killer of all options.\\" He even adds in a little story of how in his earlier days he was right about a stock but still lost money buying its calls.  He correctly advises not to sell calls against stock you don't want to let go - \\"closet uncovered writing,\\" he calls it. But very little space is given to covered option writing, which could be argued is the best investment strategy available to the public investor.   By the time you've consumed Dorsey's thoughts and observations, you will have gotten your money's worth, and hopefully plenty of useful advice on how the market really works.	2005-09-02
US	52749744	R2PHFNWNT1NERR	0975966006	998929512	The Astute Investor	Books	5	1	2	N	N	The "New" Intelligent Investor	Professor Eric Prentis' stated purpose, as presented on the front flyleaf, is to position the \\"The Astute Investor\\" as the most important stock market book since Benjamin Graham's  \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" which was written over 50 years ago in 1949.   To say that Prentis exhausts the subject would be an understatement. There is enough material here to cover entire college courses on finance, economics, and investments. In fact, the book is set up as something one might encounter in an academic setting. Questions are raised at the beginning of each chapter along with what the reader is expected to learn. It's a good overview of where he's leading you.   His statement early on that \\"Investors repeatedly find it more instructive to be taught the correct questions to be asked rather than to be given only a momentary correct answer...\\" (19) lays out the framework for what those correct questions should be.  Prentis seeks to make his mark by undermining the foundations of The Random Walk Theory, which rests on The Efficient Market Theory, and dates all the way back to the French investor, Louis Bachelier (1900). He intends to replace it with his own Discounted Capital Market Theory and Discounted News Theory - which, taken together, form his metric by which to gauge market value.  Perhaps the high point of the work is the way Prentis eviscerates The Random Walk. Anyone, today, who still believes that stock prices wander randomly across the financial landscape should spend a little extra time with Prentis as he expertly explains why it simply isn't true.  He completes his broad examination of investment philosophy with a well-thought-out 10-step approach to confronting stock market decision making, then fortifies it with a raft of reference material scattered throughout the book.   Whether \\"The Astute Investor\\" will replace \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" depends upon how well Prentis' theories age through the years.   Those investors looking for a well-rounded approach to long-term investing will find this is a good place to start.	2005-07-16

Bernard Baumohl's \\"The Secrets of Economic Indicators: Hidden Clues to Future Economic Trends and Investment Opportunities\\" starts off with a riff on how investors got sold out by their \\"expert\\" advisors and even the stock-issuing companies themselves during the recent crash. He contends investors are in the need for better guidance. The solution, he says, is an individual investor do-it-yourself approach to fundamental macroeconomic analysis based on the reported data that underlies both the domestic and international economy. <br />Make no mistake, this is one of the most useful and fundamentally sound readings of how economies really work you will ever see - much more revealing and educational than a raft of academic books purporting to teach us how the theoretical economy is supposed to function. This book magnifies the real workings of an economy (daily, weekly, monthly)  - the inputs that produce the outputs - and how the data generated from those workings is reported, analyzed, and used. <br />Baumohl lists 4 weekly, 43 monthly, and 9 quarterly releases of data in short outline form along with what they are, when they're reported, and how they're computed, along with their expected effect on the stock market, interest rates, and the dollar. <br />His goal, he states, is to answer the question of which indicators pack the greatest wallop in the financial markets and which ones are known for doing the best job predicting where the economy is going, thus influencing investments. He assigns a relevance rating to each of the indicators. <br />It's easy to get overwhelmed quickly and Baumohl is right when he laments that \\"There is too much economic information out there, and not all of it is useful.\\" <br />He should have added \\"not all that accurate\\" either. <br />As you leaf your way through the compilations, you come to realize that the \\"numbers\\" that move the markets are frequently incomplete. The queried respondents upon whose businesses and operations are being used to create data are notoriously negligent in meeting reporting deadlines which brings up the question of whether we ever get a full reading of what's being reported. Thus the need for \\"restating\\" next time around. But by \\"the next time,\\" those numbers are irreverent and relegated to history. Question: So, was that big market move last month based on bad info, and if so, will it correct itself when the old data is corrected? Not likely, because a new set of questionable data just got reported and is now at center stage. Deja vu all over again. <br />For all the questions it raises, this is a good attempt at trying to get a grip on the maze of financial accounting we're still trying to clean up, but it points out more holes than it fills. <br />One thing Baumohl doesn't address which would be a good subject for a follow-on book is that indicators don't have the same influence consistently through time. Each seems to have a life all its own. From the body counts (Vietnam) of the late 1960s, to the oil price increases of the mid-1970s, to the prime rate increases of the late 1970s, right on through the monthly deficit numbers of today, one influential indicator periodically rises to become the focal point of the press and the Wall Street pundits. Relative importance comes and goes with the seasons, and it would have been good to see a 40-year chart clearly delineating how dominant indicators of the time influenced direction of the various markets. <br />Another issue not confronted is the role played by hedonic influences on various indicators. How should we adjust for increased computer RAM or safety features of automobiles or effectiveness of medical treatment? <br />A third question concerns whether the market's reaction operates in a vacuum. Is the day the report comes out merely one more in a series of \\"jolts\\" or does it become the tipping point that truly reverses a trend which was waiting for an ignition spark? <br />A final observation sums up the underlying but unspoken concern about the whole system of governmental collected and reported figures. The world's most important investor (Alan Greenspan) obviously relies on these figures to make financial and monetary decisions. It is disconcerting to read how many of these indicators are less than what one would expect them to be. Whether Greenspan can make the correct decisions based on sometimes questionable statistics is a question that perhaps will never be answered. <br />In the mean time, we can all learn a lot about the \\"numbers\\" that have an increasingly important impact on our daily lives, to say nothing of our investments. <br />Read it and consider your options. <br />For a different angle on how the markets work see Ron Insana's excellent \\"The Message of the Markets\\" (2000) and \\"Trendwatching\\" (2002) which deal with the reality of prices rather than suppositions.  <br />	2005-04-04

Originally scheduled to be published in 2003 as \\"The Greatest Bull Market in History, 2003-2008: Investment, Business, and Life Strategies for the Greatest Boom Ahead and the Greatest Bust to Follow,\\" Harry Dent wants you to be fully invested RIGHT NOW. Just remember to get out before the crowd makes its exit starting after 2009. Harry may have dropped his warning of hard times ahead from the second half of the title of the book, but not from the content.  Got that? In now; out in 4 years. Piece of cake!  His reasoning is based on demographics and cycles which have served him well in two previous books: \\"The Great Boom Ahead\\" (1993) and \\"The Roaring 2000s\\" (1998). Anyone with a track record like his can be forgiven for his failure to see the 2000-2002 tech crash (Note: Of the Russell 3000 stocks, about 54% have risen in price since the beginning of 1998 making Dent's predictions of a \\"roaring good time\\" not that bad after all).   So, what has Harry done for us lately?  For one thing, there are enough charts, graphs, and visual explanations here to make this an excellent reference book on the past 50-100 years of economic, financial, and social history. His sources cover practically every depository of research from newsletter writers, to authors, to economists, to academia, to the government. This, in itself, is worth the price of the book. Another worthwhile point is that you will learn enough about demographics to make you something of an expert on the subject - useful knowledge to have on hand when debating the current Social Security predicament. And although he references Strauss and Howe's excellent \\"Generations\\" for his demographic work, I found it disappointing that he did not also mention their more recent \\"The Fourth Turning\\" which fits in nicely with his view of our apocalyptic future over the next 15-20 years.  The nuts and bolts of the book covers recommended types of investments: what, how, why, and when. Additional nuggets include everything from planning your future income and expenses based on the fact that tax rates are likely to rise significantly over the next 15 years (a concern also voiced by Suze Orman), to delaying charitable contributions for 5 years,  to making a quick exit from the major metropolitan areas of the country.  It's not a rosy picture for the future of our country after 2009, and he is not alone in making some of the same dire arguments as other more famous \\"doom and gloomers.\\" These long-term warnings have a way of overshadowing Dent's short term bullishness to the point that one might be forgiven for taking to the hills rather than taking to the market after a thorough reading. And this highlights the problems with long-range predictions which can be summed up with a few questions:  What are you doing this Friday night?  What are you doing next Friday night?  What are you doing a month from Friday night?  What are you doing a year from Friday night?  What are you doing 5 years from Friday night?  What are you doing 10 years from Friday night?  (Substitute \\"your money\\" for \\"you\\" and you get an idea of where this leads.)  Could anything go wrong with your plans? Could you change your mind? Could your environment change? Could your circumstances change?   When you see how hard it is to get a handle on your own doings just a few months down the road then you see what a treacherous business long-range predictions can be.   But for those who want to try their hand at it (and we're glad people like Dent do) we reap one important benefit: the predicting of danger ahead serves as the warning signals for potential catastrophes which just might be avoided if we take evasive action now. As the stock market has predicted 8 of the last 4 recessions, dire predictions of the future seldom come true because we adjust our activity specifically in order to avoid the prophesied  breakdown. Ah, the joy of feedback!  Whether Dent will be right over the next decade or so will play out day by day, but a closereading of this book will help you have better command over the decisions that you will be making as time marches on. Who knows, he just might be right. And then again...maybe not. But either way, it's your money that's out there on the line and the more you know the better you'll be able to protect it.	2005-03-19
US	52749744	RWHHXIYTTDVZ0	067977548X	523607559	Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything	Books	5	4	6	N	Y	Stop the world, but do I really want to get off?	With an interesting blend of history, philosophy, complaints, and insight, James Gleick ruminates on our \\"Faster\\" world. His timelines of progress in measuring how we live our lives are enlightening and you cannot come away from this book without having a much better take on who we are, how we got here, and where we're going.<br />If one accepts Gleick at face value, one might see this as a strong critique of modern civilization, but if you read between the lines, you see that technological progress has always speeded up time, and today we are all better off for it. Perhaps why we feel we have so much to do is that there is so much more available to be done than at any other time in history. Is that bad? Ask all the beneficiaries of modern technology if they'd rather have done it the way our forbearers did? Few would prefer to revert back to an earlier time of outhouses, the horse & buggy, and the ice box. Who would want to remove Medivac, the fire engine, antibiotics, etc., all which have \\"speeded up\\" our world?<br />The best way to digest Gleick's musings is to realize that speed is ever-present, and instead of raging against the machine, we should adapt and move forward. As he brilliantly documents, the need to speed up (via artificial means - Alice in Wonderland's pills, or other methods - HG Wells, Sherlock Holmes, etc., down through the present drug culture) has always been a part of man's desire. Now that we've done it through technology simply validates earlier longings and makes it more readily available to everybody.<br />So, it comes down to how to deal with our faster reality. Gleick's calling the issue to the fore in this best selling book is certainly one of the best ways for it to be acknowledged, brought up for discussion, and eventually dealt with, as we content with its far-reaching effects. If that occurs rapidly, then Gleick will have done his part in helping us deal with our Faster, and better, world.	2005-03-09

From the title of Barry Schwartz's \\"The Paradox of Choice,\\" we know the argument will be that choice perhaps might not always be a good thing. He likens the current situation in America to the small town resident who visits Manhattan for the first time and is overwhelmed by all the activity (choices). Although most of his research involves everything but investing, I was struck by how much his concepts fit perfectly into what would be a good way to approach a successful investing program.  <br />If we put less emphasis on his discussion of whether or not we are better off with more choices (obviously we are), and more on his advice on how to deal with this product of freedom, we get a book that is logically laid out and argues its point well. He first describes the environment in which our choices come at us, then investigates how our inability of deal with them leads to numerous problems - personal, professional, psychological. The most important part of the book is his summation of how we can adapt and learn to live with this new phenomenon. <br />His solutions, which he says require practice, discipline, and perhaps a new way of thinking, very closely follow the ingredients of good investing: <br />(1) Choose when to choose - focus on what's important. Be jealous of how you spend your time. Prioritize. Some things just aren't worth the time and effort. <br />(2) Be a chooser, not a picker - A chooser actively creates directions; pickers take whatever is available.  Choosers choose when; pickers select whatever's available. Choosers are people who think actively about the possibilities before making a decision. Choosers reflect on what's important and the consequences of the action. They makes decisions in a way that reflects awareness of what a given choice means about themselves as people. Choosers are thoughtful enough to conclude that perhaps none of the available alternatives are satisfactory. The pickers grab this or that and hope for the best. <br />(3) Satisfice more and maximize less - (His definition of the two types of people in the world - satisficers and maximizers). \\"It is maximizers who have expectations which can't be met. It is maximizers who worry most about regret, about missed opportunities...and it is mazimizers who are most disappointed when decisions are not as good as they expected.\\" - (225). The satisficers settle for something that is good enough and don't worry about the possibility that there might be something better. They have criteria and standards. They search until they find an item that fits those standards, then stop. Maximizers are constantly nagged that they haven't chosen the best. Therefore they get less satisfaction out of their choices than do satisficers. <br />(4) The opportunity costs of opportunity costs - Don't belabor the alternative - beware of getting bogged down in comparisons. If it works, go with it. <br />(5) Make your decisions nonreversible - Being able to reverse the decision makes you always wanting to do just that. A \\"the grass is always greener\\" mentality that leads to failure and unhappiness. <br />(6) Practice an \\"Attitude of Gratitude\\" - Appreciate what is, not what might have been. <br />(7) Regret less - Realize that one decision isn't going to make or break you. Live with it and move on. <br />(8) Anticipate adaptation - Don't become dissatisfied with something that was satisfying.  <br />(9) Control expectations - Don't expect too much. <br />(10) Curtail social comparisons - Don't compare yourself to others. <br />(11) Learn to love constraints - Set up your own rules and live by them. They help protect you from yourself. <br />All in all, an excellent course on dealing with an increasingly complex world. Schwartz's next work should be decision making in the investment world. He's already done all the ground work. <br />	2005-01-27

The second part serves as an interpretation of how this new world is evolving and its implications for our future. About half way through the book the true genius of Lewis becomes evident. Sandwiched between the two segments, and acting as a bridge, is as good (and simple) a description as you will ever see (he puts it in terms and images even the most ardent revolutionary can appreciate) of how capitalism works and has been able to survive all these years. It comes off as a riff on the capitalistic mentality that would do Adam Smith proud, and spin Marx and Lenin around in their graves while putting our mainstream economists to shame. <br />To quote from pages 135 - 137: \\"Socialistic impulses will always linger in the air, because they grow directly out of the human experience of capitalism. The neurotic, high-strung relationship between the outside and the inside was the market's new and improved way of dealing with the problem. Socialism hadn't been killed by capitalism. It had been subsumed by it. The market has found a way not only to permit the people who are most threatening to it their rebellious notions, but to also capitalize on them. Gnutella was one example of this; Internet was another...It was dreamed up by an academic with an anticommerical streak named Tim Berners-Lee. It was commercialized by a couple of marginal players in Silicon Valley - Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen - at least one of whom (Clark) was a sworn enemy of the big corporation. Five years later it was a mainstream commercial technology...Just as people needed other people to tell them what they were, ideas needed other ideas to tell them what they meant. That's perhaps one reason that people so explicitly hostile to capitalism were given a longer leash than usual; they posed no fundamental risk. [These] people...linger on the fringe until they dream up something that has great commercial potential. Then some big company swoops in and buys them, or they give birth to the big company themselves. Inside every alienated hacker [read: revolutionary] who thinks he stands for the `good things that ultimately don't matter to most businesses' there is a tycoon struggling to get out. It's not the system he hates. His gripe is with the price the system initially offers him to collaborate. The incentive for the outsider was to attack the inside right up to the moment he was co-opted by it. The incentive for the insider - and this took some getting used to -was to allow yourself to be attacked, and then co-opt your most ferocious attackers, and their best ideas...And in the end, those people give birth to the ideas that in turn give birth to fantastic wealth. The only thing capitalism cannot survive is stability. Stability - true stability - is an absence of progress, and a dearth of new wealth.\\" <br />Go back and read that quote again. It's priceless. 357 words that explain an economic mode of thought that has consumed thousands of pages and millions of hours of research, discussion, debate, attack, and defense, while creating the immeasurable wealth we all share in today, one way or the other.  <br />Lewis then follows up (and ends) by expanding his scope to expose the rationale \\"the establishment\\" has used throughout history to solidify its place in society after it becomes complacent, diverting its creative energy into protecting the status quo rather than pressing on with the business of progress (read: competition). Using Sun Microsystems former chief engineer Bill Joy's April 2000 Wired Magazine rant giving credence to the Unibomber's fear about the survival of mankind in the age of computers, Lewis explains that it appears the old tech guard, the innovative minds that built the technology of the past 20 years, now realizes it is becoming obsolete at the hands of the new young turks who have taken hold of progress' baton and raced on, leaving them behind.  <br />Here is where I wish Lewis' next offering would be a book about how progress throughout history has occurred in fits and jerks, frequently stymied because \\"elites\\" (standfasts) decide that things have advanced enough and it's time to consolidate gains (their gains). The rest of us suffer until the next phase of advancement breaks free of reactionary chains to ignite a new wave of technological progress destined to benefit an even larger consumer base. It is a needed book.  <br />Another thing Lewis doesn't say is that we've been co-opting the machines we've invented ever since the beginning of time. Every machine, to use Marshall McLuhan's phrase, is an extension of ourselves. Just has the hammer and saw are extensions of our hands, so it is that computers are extensions of our brains.  <br />In closing, Lewis does acknowledge the more positive aspects of technology as advocated by Ray Kurzweil (\\"The Age of Spiritual Machines\\" - 2000, and \\"Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever\\" - 2004), implying what we already know: the alternative to NEXT is what has always lurked in stasis - Death. It's what the NEXT NEW NEW THING has always been all about.  <br />As famed Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Valentine said in an recent interview, \\"Nothing is revolutionary; it's evolutionary.\\"  <br />	2004-12-15

The New, New Crisis	Like a smooth attorney summing up his case to the jury, John Rubino gives you every reason in the world to be very careful now that real estate has superseded stocks as the investment of choice. Written in June, 2003, Rubino is early.  But \\"early\\" means you won't get knocked down if you head for the door. <br />Real estate is a much more serious bubble than stocks could ever be because not only does it involve the roof over your head, it also constitutes your biggest debt, a huge amount of employment and business activity, and enough political ramifications to cause major tremors under our political landscape in the event the author is correct.  Additionally, there is no liquid market for real estate as there is for stocks. That means there is no October '87 to clean out the system in one fell swoop. Real estate busts take years to work through the system, with all the resulting hardships and recriminations that go with the bursting of a bubble. <br />Rubino wasn't as prescient as Robert Shiller who published \\"Irrational Exuberance\\" in the same month as NASDAQ topped out above 5000, but if real estate does crack, this time nobody can say they weren't forewarned. <br />The first half of the book is an excellent detailing of how the real estate market works, its history, and how the current bubble came to be. This is interesting reading for those who need to get current on the dangerous game we're playing. <br />The last half of the book gets more specific, giving you a good overview of the alternatives to keeping you money in real estate, including everything from lifestyle changes to tax consequences to his main concern - safety. <br />All in all, an excellent (and concise - 250 pages) synopsis on what more and more experts are warning is our next major crisis.  <br />	2004-11-26

Cramer (Cramer & Berkowitz, TheStreet.com, CNBC's Kudlow & Cramer) takes you to a stock market trader's hell and back in \\"Confessions of a Street Addict.\\" The analogy of investing being a war zone was coined at least 70 years ago with Gerald Loeb's \\"The Battle For Investment Survival\\" (1935). And you can't make it through the pages of this book without realizing what a battlefield it is. No book comes closer to approximating the giddy highs or heart-wrenching lows that trading puts a person through. The glory of victory and the agony of defeat are never more real as Cramer bares the trader's soul.<BR>The book reads almost like an adventure novel - ricocheting from one crisis to another, each scene set up with hero and villain, with Cramer not always coming out on top.  He starts you off with his basic biography, of being a teenage stock picker (paper trader), of his march through journalism (which shows in his writing), of Harvard Law, and eventually to Wall Street's most intense stage of conflict - the hedge fund.<BR>The beauty of this book is that you get the fly-in-the-brain's view of how traders think (or don't think when their emotions get the best of them), how Wall Street really works, and how it all congeals together to produce the daily statistics. You are there as Cramer learns the ropes from his wife-to-be, The Trading Goddess, Karen Backfish. You sweat with him as he does deals, takes chances, high-fives victories, and crashes so low with failures he could probably seep out under the door unnoticed. A lot of the things you learn run counter to what the official Wall Street line wants you to know - the inside story of the blow-up of LTCM, and how analysts, brokers, and fund managers continually jostle each other for positions of power and influence, and profit.<BR>The most interesting part of the book is being there as the Internet springs to life in the mid 90s - the wild enthusiasm and the unbelievable cluelessness that much of the Internet wasbuilt upon. But it was built, and it was built by the types of people Cramer came in contact with regularly - half geniuses, half dreamers, and half con men.  And you're right - most of the time, it didn't add up. <BR>Cramer, in addition to being a market manic, had a populist's belief that the little guys should have the same access to what the big guys had, and that the technology was now here to make it possible. TheStreet.com was the result. It's still here - one of the survivors, as is Cramer.<BR>A lot of the book is a sad commentary on how far an addiction can twist your life around. Cramer chastises himself for talking stocks beside his mother's deathbed, his tumultuous relationship with his benefactor Marty Peretz, the destruction of computers and equipment and abuse of employees when the market went against him, and how he deserted his family for the sake of \\"the game.\\" He simply couldn't stand to lose. In the end, he had enough common sense (though he makes it clear that his wife was always the steady rock in their relationship) to quit while he was ahead.<BR>I particularly enjoyed Cramer's honesty at the extremes, (the emotional soul-wrenching limit) especially the bottom in 1998 (when he caved in - \\"sell everything, the market's gonna' crash - it's the end of the world\\"), and at the top in 2000 (when he publicly announced Internet stocks would live forever), and Cramer's final tantrum with the market on 22 Nov 00 when he met his match in a long Brocade position (I quit!). Each time, Cramer was so sure he was right, nobody or thing could dissuade him of his fallibility. But each time, it was his wife (1998), or reality (2000), or, finally, his own cathartic understanding of himself that led him back to humility...and humanity.<BR>Given his personality, one must believe that if he had taken up stamp collecting, little would have changed, and it would be the philatelic world which would have had to live through Cramer's manias. Summing up his career, Cramer quotes his wife's 1998 pronouncement as they recovered from nearly panicking out at the bottom: \\"It's better to be lucky than to be good.\\" However, with the success Backfish and Cramer had, I expect their luck was more of the variety of being smart enough to be at the right place at the right time than that of a pure roll of the dice. Good traders aren't just lucky, they're good. And Cramer was good, even if he was an addict.	2004-05-25

The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.&quot; Or try Will Rogers: \\"Don't gamble; take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it don't go up, don't buy it.\\"  The strange thing about humor is that there's usually a lot of truth underneath.<BR>Now we get Borowitz, the satirist, in his best form to expose The *Recent* Emperor's New Clothes. From the computer cowboys riding their monitors from dawn to dusk (and into the night), to the official corporate and governmental pronouncements, to the analysts' hype, to the media's cheerleading, to our own self-delusions, everything and everyone comes in for a good drubbing. Reminds me of taking what we thought we were supposed to be serious about during the mania and hanging it out on the line for sport. Makes us look silly. And looking back at it with 5 years hindsight, you really wouldn't want to see that home movie showing how you explained to the children that you were getting rich in the great boom either. About the only sign of the times Borowitz didn't pulverize was the major TV network news programs profiling movie stars and taxicab drivers as prescient stock pickers. That just had to be the final signal that a top was near, and ranks right up there with the bellhops of 1929. A good, quick read, and a lot of fun too. Refer back to it next time things get too good to be true.	2004-03-26

Whether he's on his knees confessing to being a stock market addict or crawling across the table, ranting and raving on CNBC, he entertains, invigorates, and educates. But he's also a bull in the china closet - so now, after the 2000-2002 debacle, we get his condemnation of the whole Wall Street scene inscribed with the immortal words, \\"You Got Screwed,\\" as he picks over the underbelly of the tainted beast. Yes, it's a short book, but that's its selling point: Cramer crams everything into something you can sit down and read in a couple of hours - and actually understand via his take-no-prisoners style. His brash attitude is more of the street fighter than the wood-paneled office executive, and this train wreck of a market comes alive with real personalities backed up against the wall as Cramer blasts them to bits. No words wasted. Just typical Cramer. You either love him or hate him, but you can't ignore him.<BR>First he tells you why the system reeked and rotted, eventually collapsing under the weight of fakery and fraud. Then he ends the book by advising you how to never be caught up in Wall Street's self-serving ever again. And he does a good job of both.<BR>His advice on how to protect yourself in the future is good, basic, Investing 101: \\"Admit the crash happened and move on, find a trusted financial advisor if you won't or don't want to do the homework yourself (he advises 2 hours a week), investigate and analyze companies prior to putting one red cent into them, forget 'buy and hold,' learn to read balance sheets, put emphasis on dividends, monitor insider and corporate ('buybacks') buying of their own stock, use P/Es to value stocks, always keep cash available, and avoid margin.\\" Good advice from a pro who's seen and done it all. <BR>Now the fun part begins.  Mutual funds end up getting the brunt of the Cramer cannonballs. The game they played was \\"beat the numbers.\\" The financial press loved it because it gave them \\"the reason\\" why the market was going up. Made they look smart. Cramer takes apart this silliness, exposing it for what it was - accounting gimmickry, pure and simple. All that the analysts and companies had to do was lowball the upcoming quarter, then \\"beat the number\\" by a penny, and we were off to the races. So why was the investing public taken in so thoroughly? \\"The public thought it knew all it had to know...Democratization (of stocks), however did not bring with it all the skills you needed to make good judgments for the long term. For example, no one provided the tools of how to read a balance sheet or assess cash flows. No one taught people how to spot red flags or how to tell if a company wasn't doing as well as you thought. And no one explained that stocks, particularly tech stocks, were high-risk pieces of paper...\\" (26)<BR>Moving on to corporate governance, Cramer slams the looting of the treasury via stock options as corporate insiders served themselves a hearty dish of cheap stock, seemingly at no cost to the bottom line. Only later do we now realize that dog won't hunt either.<BR>He indicts the SEC, the accountants, the corporate officers, the boards of directors, the media, the brokerage houses, the analysts, the academics...everybody except those whose money was being looted - the individual investor.<BR>Cramer saves his strongest salvos for his slicing and dicing of Enron. His delivers an indictment of the whole political culture of the 90s with: \\"...maybe it was just everyone because Enron represented, not a simple fraud like WorldCom, but a wholesale breakdown of every aspect of the legal, accounting, governmental, and regulatory bulwark to keep corporate America honest.\\" Sounds remotely familiar like another entertaining individual of the 90s who took shot at the same targets through humor. The comedian Seinfeld perhaps knew us better than we knew ourselves at the time, as his four scoundrels lied, cheated, scammed, and flimflammed their way through the decade - an era that produced a \\"something for nothing\\" attitude that seems to have permeated every facet of our lives, and emptied out our pocketbooks as well. <BR>In the end, Cramer's diatribe is basically an intelligent, heart-felt cry for investor education. Education of investment techniques and strategies, and an understanding of ourselves. Learn that and you won't have to depend on a Cramer or anyone else to manage your finances, plus you won't get screwed by anybody either.	2004-03-10
US	52749744	R13LYDYK8ZG6T3	0066620465	679582054	The Message of the Markets	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	The market is the message	CNBC anchor Ron Insana's second book on the stock market, \\"The Message of the Markets,\\" follows \\"Traders' Tales\\" in 1996, and does an excellent job of selling you on the idea that the market does send signals for anyone who's interested in looking for them. Using Insana's words, \\"Many times the prices of stocks, bonds, and commodities accurately anticipate or forecast future events. \\"But what is a \\"market?\\" If a market is where buyers and sellers come together and agree to exchange assets - stocks, bonds, futures, options, wheat, oil, gold, cloth, Beanie Babies, guns, drugs, etc., then the \\"message\\" of the market has to be the PRICE resulting from that exchange. That price level conveys enough information that if you know what you are looking for, you will be able to anticipate future events solely on the basis of price and its trend. Why? Because there is what Insana calls \\"smart money\\" and \\"dumb money.\\"Smart money belongs to insiders, those closest to the action who see and know what is happening. They act on their knowledge, leaving their tell-tale footprints of transaction prices for all to see. Then there are the outsiders; the ones who wake up one morning and read about something that just happened, realize that it is significant, and decide to catch the obvious trend already in progress, invariably buying from those same insiders who got in months ago anticipating exactly that outcome. What Insana doesn't say is that without smart money to indicate the way, all markets would be chaotic, panic-driven price spikes in either direction as everybody tried to react to the same thing at the same time. He is particularly correct when he warns to watch out for the price move \\"with no apparent reason.\\" It can signal momentous events on the horizon.The real message of the book thus becomes that if you learn to track where the \\"smart money\\" is going, then in addition to profiting along with the insiders on the various price moves, you can also make more intelligent business, investment, and career decisions.  Insana uses the interest rate yield curve as well as popular averages to predict the onset of recessions; market internals (Advance/Decline Line, diverging Dow Jones Averages, etc.) to predict the stock market; and commodity price movements to predict geopolitical events.  <BR>He gives industry/sector group relative strength rotation credit for frequently predicting the economy's strengths and weaknesses and cites ways in which this can be used in selecting career paths as well as suggesting business trends. He uses commodity price moves as signals that foretell future events such as   Chernobyl, the Gulf War, the Egypt-Libya potential war, and other geopolitical upheavals. However, I believe he makes too much of the market selling off just prior to the announcement that JFK had been shot. There is a story about a certain well-known network newscaster in Dallas making the call back to his NY newsroom, then ripping the pay phone out of the wall to keep other reporters from using it to get to their newsrooms. So there may have been real reasons for the news delay. Anyway, the market was shut down with the Dow suffering only a 3% decline. After remaining closed one additional day, the market continued its upward climb for the next 3 years. While a member of the Pacific Stock Exchange, I witnessed the same momentary \\"front-running\\" when Reagan was shot on  March 30, 1981. On that day something \\"felt\\" amiss when we suddenly got hit will an avalanche of sell orders. Minutes later, the news tape announced that the president had been shot. But like in the Kennedy situation, the market dipped momentarily, then continued its rally. In these two cases, the message was inconsequential, financially speaking. After giving numerous examples of what market signals are and how they've fared over the years, Insana asks his most thought-provoking question: \\"So why was it that most investors, all the world's politicians...failed to notice trouble signs on the horizon? Once again, it was the failure of many observers to pay attention to the market's ominous message.\\" The implication being that the rain clouds were forming but nobody took notice. The answer is simple yet unsatisfying: As long as we listen to what \\"they\\" say instead of watching what \\"they\\" do, we will always fall victim to \\"their\\" market. What Insana is making a case for is a market discipline termed Technical Analysis. It looks at market action, valuing above all else the constant interplay between the supply and demand for a any tradable entity, and considers Fundamental Analysis (Wall Street research) as so much hot air. It is not a particularly popular stance, but it is much closer to allying yourself with reality than anything else.	2004-03-02
US	52749744	R1E18JECK3CA35	0060084626	527458932	TrendWatching: Don't Be Fooled by the Next Investment Fad, Mania, or Bubble	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Watch out for the road signs - they won't steer you wrong	CNBC anchor Ron Insana's \\"Trendwatching,\\" his third examination of the stock market after \\"The Message of the Markets\\" in 2001 and \\"Traders' Tales\\" in 1996, should have been entitled \\"How not to lose your bundle the next time around.\\" His stated purpose is to save the individual investor from him/her self during the next investment bubble that's sure to come. And he delivers his message loud and clear, whether it will be heeded or not. Throughout this work, Insana strains to point out that although bubbles occur, you do not have to be a victim; that with the historical knowledge he presents, you can arm yourself to go forth and do battle with market forces to survive and prosper through the bubbles' wild rides.This book is a revealing trip down investment-history lane and should be placed beside every investor's phone or electronic communications device as a reminder not to get caught up in the emotional mania that might be brewing right around the corner. He begins by defining what a bubble is, and borrowing strongly from Charles Kindleberger's (who died recently) \\"Manias, Panics, and Crashes,\\" Insana traces bubbles starting from our most recent stock market debacle all the way back to Holland's Tulip Craze in the early 1600s. He finds that they all follow the Kindleberger (and Hyman Minsky) script: an invention or discovery sets off \\"a new era,\\" then easy profits (speculation) fueled by easy credit or monetary conditions lead to the eventual parabolic blow off. Revulsion and recrimination set in as prices plunge back to earth. The insiders will have made out like bandits but the little guys get left holding a worthless bag of stocks. Reforms are instituted to correct the excesses. Then the stage gets set for the next bubble which will be of a different variety but of the same nature as the one before.The writing is crisp and the language is lucid. It's as interesting as it is educational. Where I would have wanted more insight concerns Insana's statement, \\"Bubbles, while useful in the building of transformational industries, are destructive when it comes to the financial well-being of the individual investor.\\" That sounds like he's a bubble buster. Yet, he frequently references high-tech venture capitalist Robert McNamee who contends that without bubbles nothing is ever accomplished. So which is it? Can progress really happen without these manias in which we literally throw money at the \\"new, new thing\\" of Michael Lewis fame? Thinking along the lines much like the ongoing debate about what part adversity plays in human accomplishment, Insana raises the question of  whether we can build new infrastructure without hurting the losers who invariably get in too late and stay in too long? The question remains to be answered.Another inquiry comes to mind while rummaging through the canal building, railroad building, automobile making, radio broadcasting...and Internet bubbles of the past couple hundred years: What part does politics play in the care and feeding of the \\"good times\\" so necessary for bubbles to form and spread. Did political elites of yesteryear encourage earlier bubbles? Although LBJ's Fed chairman, William McCesney Martin, said that the Fed's job was to \\"take away the punch bowl\\" just as the party gets started, would politicians sit idly by and watch the Fed (or some other monetary authority) squash a bubble, and with it the jobs and business conditions necessary for their (re)election? Well, we know George Bush did in the early 90s. But more recently, would Clinton  have paid no mind to the Fed if it had begun raising stock margin requirements after Greenspan's famous December 1996 \\"Irrational Exuberance\\" speech? Did Clinton  not learn something from the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994 after Greenspan goosed short term interest rates 100% earlier that year, and long term rates followed by rising 25%? Toward the end of the book, Insana ventures into the future by taking the precepts he has established for the creation of a bubble and plugs them into today's market. It isn't very difficult for him to make the case for hard assets being the next mania. Referring back to Kindleberger, he finds that just about all the ingredients necessary for a hard-asset bubble are in place: easy monetary policy, a weakening dollar, war, high oil prices, strong real estate demand, and an escalating gold price. The only thing missing to set off this bubble is the recognition of the presence of \\"inflation.\\" When that gains currency in the media, then it's \\"everybody into the pool\\" and off we go again. Perhaps the true worth of this book is the graph on the last page - a picture of what Insana has been defining, chronicling, and warning against. Taken from The Bank Credit Analyst newsletter, it is a composite chart of the path all bubbles take. Just fit in whatever current mania is climbing skyward, and if it resembles this pattern...GET OUT! For Insana, that's the real payoff for keeping an eye on the trend.	2004-03-02
US	52749744	R1KWQ20ZSGLYQQ	0316192945	63681096	American Sucker	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Worth the read for the issues it raises	You instinctively know that \\"The New Yorker\\" movie critic David Denby ought to be able to tell a good story, and that the author of \\"The Great Books\\" ought to be able to weave revelation into the most daunting of experiences. Add all this together and we ought to get a rocking good ride through the rise and fall of NASDAQ 5000 as seen from main street's point of view. And we do.<BR>Needing money to buy his soon-to-be-ex-wife out of their Upper West Side apartment, Denby loaded up on NASDAQ mutual funds in Oct 99 and NASDAQ stocks in Jan 00. The rest is history, as they say. But the process (losing $800,000 from March 2000 to October 2002) is what makes this heart warming tale of decline and fall, and redemption, well worth the read. <BR>Taken from an investor's viewpoint, the book should have been entitled \\"How to lose money doing everything an investor ought not to do.\\" (1) Don't go into the stock market with a goal of making 1 million dollars in one year - if you want to gamble, go to Vegas. At least you get free drinks. (2) Don't ignore history - every possible danger sign was flashing by the end of 1999, a fact Denby acknowledged. (3) Don't attend high-tech investment dog-and-pony shows and blindly step in the manure spread around by the hosts. (4) Don't be afraid to take responsibility for your own investments. Putting the onus off on somebody else to escape the ultimate decisions is a fool's game. (5) Don't give way to emotionalism, especially when your heart doesn't understand what your head is saying. <BR>All of this is instructive, but the true gems come to light when Denby goes searching for the reasons why. Why did he do what he did, and why did the investment process treat him so shabbily? Up front, Denby admits to being politically liberal with a strong distrust of the business community. After all, he's a movie critic by trade. He goes into deep ruminations on the anti-capitalist, anti-materialistic, anti-consumerism philosophies of luminaries from asfar back as Thorstein Veblen and as current as Juliet Schor. Still, he wanted to be part of the Wall Street crowd, the wealthy, as he calls them, and he gladly entered into the dance.<BR>His most revealing, and important, commentary is through his love/hate relationship with ImClone founder and now felon, Sam Waksal. Happy to become one of \\"Sam's pals\\" and bask in the light of his dinner parties, Denby's exploration of what made Sam tick is worth the whole book. As he pounds the pavement of Manhattan's sidewalks, searching for meaning, Denby conjures up the 7 deadly sins, and settles on envy leading to greed as the two best fitted for himself and his new cronies on his chosen way to wealth. Near the end of the book, he even tries to offer just how much a \\"wealthy\\" person needs to have before becoming \\"greedy.\\" Yet, as if to argue with himself, he makes the following observation, certainly the most cogent of the work: \\"The one thing shadowing their (the high-tech entrepreneurs) triumph was aging and its scything climax, death. It was the final victory that capitalism, which had swept all before it, could not achieve - immortality, or at least a long, disease-free ascent into a happy and productive old age. And yet they were arrogant enough to want to lick death. And I believe it was that realization, as much as the drive for efficiency and wealth, that pushed the all-optical network (and tech/biotech revolution) forward.\\" And of Waksal in particular: \\"He looked to be in superb health, but the threat of a sickened old age was haunting him. This specter (`Every man, if he lives long enough, will get prostate cancer.'), he thought, had to be vanquished, - age postponed, vitality prolonged.\\"<BR>But why does this motivation surprise Denby? Is this not why we have an economy - and capitalism - and progress? To supply the necessities of life for as long as life can be sustained? Continuing, on pages 196 and 197, he sums up the driving force of the George Gilders, Waksals, etc.: \\"These men were not just fighting off thoughts of death, they literally were not going to accept death, and that made them more ambitious than men of all other generations.\\" That's as heroic a vision as mankind has ever had.<BR>Denby also asks the most important questions for our society today as we sort out what happened. \\"Does speculation like this...do any permanent damage to an economy? Or is it, despite the ruin it sows among the unwise, a useful and socially benevolent event in the end? And the lesser question is: Must speculation always be accompanied by fraud? Is there something inescapably criminal in the process of quickly raising money for some new enterprise?\\" Later, he responds: \\"The answer, of course, is that there's something `escapably' criminal, and that's why we need regulators, prosecutors, and an ethics that the ambitious and wealthy live by.\\" <BR>In the end, Denby comes to terms with his losses and his failings. It was the breakup of his marriage, the apparent worldwide victory of capitalism (supposedly commercializing all the arts), and the threat that creativity had been siphoned off from the arts into science and technology that had blown a hole in Denby, causing him to question his whole life's purpose. I'm not so sure that Denby didn't secretly rejoice that Wall Street failed him as a God. It freed him to return to his chosen profession, giving two thumbs up to Eminem's \\"8 Mile\\" for its \\"renewal out of economic decline and cultural despair.\\" But as he comes closer to that dreaded \\"threat of a sickened old age\\" that drove the Waksals of the world, Denby just might go looking for life's renewal in the companies that the Waksal's of the world built. And then, perhaps Denby will question whether he really was a sucker after all.	2004-02-25
US	52749744	R1R6B8M5DHDYEX	0470870907	906204004	Conquer the Crash: You Can Survive and Prosper in a Deflationary Depression	Books	5	17	21	N	N	Something wicked this way comes	Robert Prechter is expecting a devastating dose of deflation leading to a depression, and no collective body (read \\"government\\") can do anything about it. He is one of the \\"old-timers\\" who has survived the market's up and downs for more than 20 years, and his outlook on our situation is not to be taken lightly. Being high profile, his pronouncements make headlines, and it's all too easy to point to a previous mistake and write him off. However, his scholarship is second to none. He's been right in the past; he just may be right again. And if he is, most of us are in real trouble. Thus, his argument is too important to dismiss without a thorough reading.<BR>Prechter starts with a good overview of his pride and joy, and the basis of all his study - The Elliott Wave Theory. His conclusion is that we are at the end of the 5th wave of the Grand Supercycle which reaches all the way back to 1700. We're talking big-time financial implications here.<BR>To quote Prechter on describing the milieu we've just lived through, \\"Third waves are built upon muscle and brain. Fifth waves are built upon cleverness and dreams. During third waves, people focus on production to get rich. During fifth waves, they focus on finance to get rich.\\" Sounds remotely familiar.<BR>At the bottom of all our troubles is debt. Gobs and gobs of debt, piled as high as the eye can see. Deflation/depression results in a contraction of credit as debt gradually gets wiped out...one way or the other. It produces a line of falling dominos where less credit means less borrowing means less spending means less production means less employment...which means more liquidations which means more defaults as everything feeds on the downward spiral.<BR>Prechter blames some of this on The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Money Control Act of 1980 which gave the Fed authority to monetize any government agency's (any government anywhere) debt. That power was recently noted in a speech on 21 Nov 02 at the National Economist's Club in DC by Fed governor Bernanke who said, \\"But the U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost.\\" Clearly, Greenspan & Co. don't plan to sit around while deflation envelopes us. Yet, Prechter contends that the Fed's action to drive rates downward, in addition to continually reliquefying the economy via debt, also participated in the initial phase of the deflationary process. <BR>One of Prechter's most fascinating contributions on which he's written several books (\\"The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior and the New Science of Socionomics,\\" \\"Pioneering Studies in Socionomics,\\" and \\"Socionomics: The Science of History and Social Prediction\\"), is that stock market crashes produce depressions and stock market booms produce eras of optimism and economic expansion. Not the other way around. The stock market is a discounting mechanism, leading the economy, not following it. He, correctly, I believe, perceives that stock market values are a function of investor (and public) psychology. When we feel good about ourselves, we bid prices up as is evidenced by expanding PEs. When we are down on ourselves, we sell stocks down to rock bottom prices, again evidenced by low PEs. Therefore, he measures the health of the whole system based on the health of the stock market. And that, he shows us, is in very bad condition - internally weak and grossly overpriced. He even puts a potential number at where the Dow Jones Industrial Average could eventually bottom out...all the way down to 777!<BR>From the stock market, Prechter continues on to the economy, where debt, liquidity, GDP, production, unemployment, trade and budget deficits, etc. are all laid out for investigation, and the picture is one of weakness compared with the economic cycles that have preceded our current era. It is the portrayal of a gradually slowing economy.<br />Allof this foreboding coincides with the Kondratieff Wave (Kondratieff Winter), producing this perfect storm of financial upheaval that's just around the corner.<BR>After laying out why things are going to hell in a hand basket, Prechter proceeds to recommend a way out for the individual investor. He summarizes a list of investment precautions to take to protect yourself from potential calamity by surveying the various asset classes available to us today. <BR>Bonds - Risky. AAA are safest but ultimately depend on ability to service debt.<BR>Real Estate: Lack of liquidity. Prices will collapse with everything else.<BR>Collectibles: Coins, maybe.<BR>Stay away from commodities except gold and silver after they bottom out.<BR>Money market funds are suspect.<BR>Stocks: Only inverse index funds or going short.<BR>Cash: All assets go down in deflation except cash. Short-term Treasuries. Outside US - hold bonds and notes of strong foreign entities. Protect against hyperinflation. <BR>If you listen to Precheter, you will, as he cautions, not be any worse off if it doesn't happen as he predicts. But if he is right, then, at the bottom, you will be in perfect shape to buy stocks, real estate, etc. at bargain basement once-in-a-lifetime prices.<BR>The book tells you why and how disaster could happen, with a lot of evidence on its side. Will it happen? No one knows how it will play out, but Prechter has done his best to ready you for the worst. Perhaps all we're waiting for is the last straw to break the camel's back, Precheter's \\"The Tipping Point.\\"	2004-02-19

We, on the other hand, labor under the delusion that we do know something. He invests to profit from the inevitable train wreck somewhere down the tracks (1987, 1998, 2000), while our ignorance will destroy us  because we don't see the calamity coming. And we don't see it coming because we mistakenly thought we saw a pattern of clear vistas ahead.<br />This work is one in a long line that looks out at the world and sees only chaos. Since there are no patterns and no repetitive behavior, there cannot be any predictions based on past events or probable behavior.<br />He would have us believe that hard work, drive, creativity, etc. all play second fiddle to luck when it comes to life's successes. He bases his philosophy on Karl Popper who postulated that there were only two kinds of theories: those which are known to be wrong and those that have not yet been known to be wrong. Thus, no investment theories can hold water and no one can make sense of our uncertain world. And with this as his starting point, Taleb launches into the argument that no matter how long a trader might experience success, he will eventually \\"blow up,\\" and that blow-up will be proof that no skill was ever involved - just dumb luck. Perhaps the trader simply happened to ride the right trend for as long as it went. Thus, Taleb's corollary is that since nothing works, why waste time trying to find a \\"system?\\" It's all random anyway.<br />Although I would argue many of his suppositions, he does make excellent observations as to why traders blow up: (1) a tendency to get married to their positions, (2) a tendency to change their story as needed so as to justify their long-term investments, (3) no precise game plan ahead of time as to what to do in the event of losses, (4) an absence of critical thinking - they don't learn from their losses, (5) denial - refusal to stare reality in the face. But his best insight is into the failings of professional money management - \\"the firehouse effect\\" where mutual fund managers only converse with others in the industry, thereby accepting as common wisdom what an ordinary outsider would see as sheer bunk.<br />Taleb's chosen investment strategy appears to be as a hunter of crises with a game plan designed to profit from that rare, \\"ten-sigma\\" event (sigma = 1 standard deviation). He gives little insight into his own success, based on randomness, but he does favor buying out-of-the-money options. His passing remark that the Crash of '87 made him as a trader could well mean that he was long puts.<br />A thorough reading of the book leaves us caught between Fama, Merton, and Malkiel's randomness based on an efficient market being rational, and Taleb's randomness based on the market reflecting human irrationality (based on our ignorance of probability and statistics). Both sides believe that the future, for investment purposes, is unpredictable. And how did we get into this fix of playing against a stacked deck? The mathematician and probability expert in Taleb gives us his most revealing statement near the end of the book: \\"We (mankind)  have not had the incentive to develop an ability to understand probability (to make decisions) because we did not have to do so (because we lived in a deterministic world) - but the more profound reason is that we are not designed to understand things. We are built only to survive and procreate.\\"  Ugh!<br />After debunking any and all who make claims on the future, Taleb signs off with his main piece of advice: \\"Good luck.\\"<br />So what do we have for this effort? Or in Taleb's words, as he would peruse a bookstore's shelves, \\"Is this book worth my time?\\"  We get a reminder that life is the taking of chances since nothing can be assured for tomorrow. But don't we already know that? Is that not why we do study patterns and make assumptions on what has and has not worked in the past, and build on what we learn? Is that not the basis of Kuhn's \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions?\\" Perhaps Taleb's randomness (chaos) is merely the interval between paradigm shifts - the confusing time when one set of patterns is discredited while a new set of patterns is being validated. And what of traders blowing up, supposedly proving Taleb's contention that any previous success was luck? Were they merely unlucky, or were they foolish not to heed obvious increased risk. Abundant evidence exists that there is always sufficient warning for this long-awaited ten-sigma event that does (unlucky) traders in. Greenspan issued his warning of \\"irrational exuberance\\" at the end of 1996. And there certainly was enough financial media proclaiming \\"it's different this time\\" to remind everybody that there has been a \\"previous time\\"  that was different. Surely there was enough \\"preparation\\" or patterns to warn anyone who wanted to consider risk. Mathematicians may dominate the derivatives trade, but the stock market is as much about investor psychology and real economic progress as it is about probability distribution theory. But yes, the book is worth your time. It makes you question what you believe and gives you an opportunity to confirm what you know (a statement that Taleb would certainly never accept).at not the basis of Kuhn's \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions?\\" Perhaps Taleb's randomness (chaos) is merely the interval between paradigm shifts - the confusing time when one set of patterns is discredited while a new set of patterns is being validated. And what of traders blowing up, supposedly proving Taleb's contention that any previous success was luck? Were they merely unlucky, or were they foolish not to heed obvious increased risk. Abundant evidence exists that there is always sufficient warning for this long-awaited ten-sigma event that does (unlucky) traders in. Greenspan issued his warning of \\"irrational exuberance\\" at the end of 1996. And there certainly was enough financial media proclaiming \\"it's different this time\\" to remind everybody that there has been a \\"previous time\\"  that was different. Surely there was enough \\"preparation\\" or patterns to warn anyone who wanted to consider risk. Mathematicians may dominate the derivatives trade, but the stock market is as much about investor psychology and real economic progress as it is about probability distribution theory. But yes, the book is worth your time. It makes you question what you believe and gives you an opportunity to confirm what you know (a statement that Taleb would certainly never accept).	2004-02-17

The authors' measuring stick was \\"q,\\" the Nobel prize-winning economist James Tobin's 1969 invention to value stocks. It is the simple formula of stock price divided by corporate net worth (replacement cost). Essentially, it works over time like an oscillator. They take considerable amount of space to prove it is a more reliable indicator of stock market value than dividends or P/E. And it foretold harrowing events when it was computed and published in early 2000 with NASDAQ at 5000. Now the bigger question: So, what use is it going forward from today?<BR>Their method of argument is to chart 100 years of historical stock prices against historical q, then create \\"normal,\\" \\"overvalued,\\" and \\"undervalued\\" zones with which you should make investment decisions. A reversion to the mean (in this case downward) is what drives their prediction for an extended period of stock market \\"under performance\\" during the foreseeable future. Stocks were and still are overvalued, they say, and therefore should be avoided until values return to more \\"normal\\" levels.<BR>By the end of 1999, there were no shortages of bears calling for a crash of monstrous proportions based on any number of indicators, P/E and dividend yield included. As it turned out, all were correct. But as with all \\"fundamental\\" analysis, timing was lacking. Some bears had prowled the investment landscape for most of the decade and had come up empty until the turning of the millennium. Smithers and Wright, however, hit the market's nail on the head.<BR>Early on in their presentation, they admit that q is not very important most of the time because most of the time markets are not obviously overvalued or undervalued. And the authors do get sidetracked on whether you should pick stocks individually or go with index funds (they give 3 reasons why individual stock picking doesn't work). They do come through loud and clear that stocks are for buying AND selling, and although stocks are good for the long term, when they get too expensive, they should be avoided like the plague. <BR>The worth of the work is the powerful argument, intelligently presented and documented, as to why stock prices were sure to fall at the time the work was published. And fall they did. For awhile, anyway.<BR>Now, the question for you is not whether or not their data and logic make sense; it's whether you want to base your investment decisions on whether other people think it makes sense. And whether we like it or not, since there is no universal arbiter of stock market value except other people's money, investing comes down to Keynes' beauty contest (General Theory pages 154 - 156). If you want to be on the winning side, you don't vote for who you think is the prettiest; you vote for who you think others will consider the prettiest. Translated here, it means you should value stocks the way stocks have been valued over the past century by previous investors. The idea of q is based on what other people throughout history eventually decided were the limits of value. And yes, q says the market is still dangerously overvalued. But during the interlude of the past 14 months and 3000 Dow points (40% gain) prove, a lot of money has been left laying on the table by simply abandoning the investment environment completely until stocks once again become \\"cheap.\\"  Another Keynesism: \\"The market can stay irrational (overvalued/undervalued) longer than you can stay solvent.\\"	2004-02-10
US	52749744	R158QSDK3RZQE3	1587982145	454618609	Black Monday: The Stock Market Catastrophe of October 19, 1987	Books	5	10	10	N	N	By the skin of our teeth	Former Wall Street Journal writer and current financial communications consultant Tim Metz takes you up to and through the stock market crash of October 19 and 20, 1987, by looking into the minds of eyewitnesses and participants closest to the event. He introduces you to specialists on the NYSE, traders in the Chicago pits, government officials who monitor the country's finances, and exchange officers who have responsibility to oversee securities trading, all who played a part in what happened.<br />Although the blame for the mania leading up to the crash, and the crash itself, can be spread around to many contributing factors, especially portfolio insurance (a dumb idea)  and program trading (index arbitrage), one clear hero emerges in the person of NYSE chairman John Phelan. Metz assigns him prime responsibility for having the foresight and stamina to keep the exchange open in the face of incredible pressure to close it by practically all others concerned. This brave act probably prevented a worse panic and the resulting loss of confidence in markets in the future.<BR>The main point of Metz's investigation centers around the \\"second\\" panic of mid-morning Tuesday, October 20. I was a member of the Pacific Stock Exchange at the time, and Metz is correct in stating that as the market began to roll over after a strong opening, professionals became transfixed with fear that maybe we were really beginning to see the wheels come off for good. As Fred Sanford would have said, \\"This is the big one, Elizabeth!\\" We had survived the expected Monday \\"crash,\\" and Tuesday should have seen some sensibility returning to the action, especially with the Dow having fallen some 37% from 2700 to support at around 1900. But the strong opening quickly gave way to new waves of selling that seemed to have no end. Even those of us who had begun the week short were deluged with so many sell orders that we quickly became net long...and net losers.<BR>The Merc's S&amp;P pit halted trading, asdid many Dow stocks in NY. Then, miraculously, out of nowhere, the MMI pit on the CBOT caught a bid. Prices recovered. And that was the bottom - 12:30 in NY, 11:30 in Chicago, 9:30 in San Francisco. Metz implies that \\"manipulation\\" (government ?) may have had a hand in the turn, as have many other commentators since then. But it may just as well have been Adam Smith's unseen hand stepping into the momentary void vacated by sold-out sellers. We'll probably never know for sure. Whatever it was, it saved the day. As Metz aptly points out, the market is as much a psychological creature as it is a function of supply and demand, and a heroic gesture at the right moment can turn the tide of battle.<BR>The book is laid out like a shipwreck disaster movie, which begins by introducing a representative cross-section of passengers and crew, then follows them as imminent danger eventually engulfs everyone's lives. Who will survive and who will perish?<BR>It's a good read. But the real enjoyment comes at the end when you realize that so many people you've been following and care about worked in cooperation to keep the market afloat, and that critical decisions made under intense pressure preserved the system we have today. <BR>The market treaded water for the next few years as it repaired the damage, then took off on an eight-year 9800-point Dow rally that would have never been possible except for the brave actions by the people who took charge to preserve the integrity of the market when it was under its most frightening assault.	2004-01-26

William Bernstein, market historian, scholar, and strategist, writes this new book with the confidence of his experience and the courage of his convictions, just as he did in his earlier \\"The Intelligent Asset Allocator.\\"  The work is an expansion on the theme that you cannot beat the market by timing or hiring active professional fund managers, so allocate, sit back, and enjoy the long-term ride. His advice is equally applicable to the novice as well as the veteran investor. You get a short course on what market returns you should expect, why you cannot beat the market, why the professionals can't help you, and how to set up your own portfolio using index funds. In other words, he has no use for the investment business other than the index funds it produces.<BR>Chapter 5 on Manias is an excellent history of economic progress, and obviously the groundwork that led to his soon-to-be-published \\"The Birth of Plenty\\" (mid-2004) on the origins of the West's affluence. I particularly appreciated his credit to Hyman Minsky on the pattern of bubbles. Although Kindleberger has covered much of the same ground and with greater visibility in the press, Minsky's contributions are more insightful to understanding the distinct nature of economic manias.<BR>Another interesting tidbit is his portrayal of technology as being, in general, a bad business endeavor. Bill Fleckenstein has made this point frequently that technology, unlike Buffett's desired \\"consumer monopoly,\\" is easily outmoded and supplanted with the new, new thing. Let's just be thankful that earlier entrepreneurs took the time and the risk to create progress.<BR>The true worth of the book comes under the heading of  \\"Why investors lose money.\\" This is the cornerstone of Bernstein's philosophy stating that if you can keep from losing, you will win: <BR>(1) Instead of joining the herd mentality, get out when \\"everybody\\" knows that something is a good thing. It only means that everyone who wanted to buy already has; there are no buyers left. Prices can only fall.<BR>(2) Overcome overconfidence by checking the performance figures. Few professionals ever \\"beat the market.\\" Why do you think you can?<BR>(3) Understand that all investments return to the mean, thus past performance is no indication of future performance.<BR>(4) Don't trade for excitement. Look elsewhere for entertainment.<BR>(5) Keep your eye on the long term and don't be panicked out by emotional short term swings. <BR>(6) Realize that there are no \\"great companies.&quot; The 1000+% returns are few and far between.<BR>(7)  Accept that the market is random. Therefore don't get fooled into believing patterns repeat. Index funds are the only way to go.<BR>(8) Check your accounting carefully. Don't overstate your successes while forgetting your losses. Keep track of the portfolio's total return.<BR>(9) Don't get taken for a ride by the investment industry. Trust no one.<BR>It gets a little trickier when he begins building portfolios. Using representative stereotypes, he sets up hypothetical investments using US stock index funds made up of large caps, small caps, large value, small value, REITs, plus Foreign securities. The remaining assets should be split up between cash and bonds (long and short). Your results will be dependent on how well you can approximate this theories. Another catch comes with \\"rebalancing.\\" Bernstein's advice here is also well taken. Sell out a portion of the superior performers to bring your percentages back in line to their desired weigh in the portfolio and re-allocate those funds into the underperformers to bring their numbers up to desired percentages. Regardless of his distain for decision making, this does require skill and action on your part, but Bernstein has given you enough help to get the job done correctly.	2004-01-23

Achelis, founder of EQUIS and creator of MetaStock has compiled the quintessential reference book for technical analysis covering practically every indicator known to mankind. But if there is one thing to imprint onto your brain from this book, it is contained in pages covering the subject \\"Support and Resistance.\\" In all my years of floor trading, I have never seen anything more valid in price trend analysis than this horizontal (support) line connecting previous tops which once surmounted becomes the floor for the next move up. Achelis calls the pullback after breakout \\"trader's remorse\\" and it is the ideal place to buy into a strong stock in a strong industry. His several graphs depicting this pattern couldn't be more precise. The pictures are worth a thousand words. Armed with only this bit of technical knowledge, an investor would improve the odds of profitability many times over by merely subjecting every potential purchase to this test pattern. I take it that because Achelis spent about 5 times as much material on this one concept as he did the other  indicators, he agrees that this is truly one of the most important theories in technical analysis.<br />The rest of the book is devoted to short descriptions of what various indicators mean, how they area calculated, and how they are used. This is especially useful when subscribing to any of the numerous web sites that now carry dozens of indicators. Keep the book close to the computer to have it as a ready reference. I doubt if you will find more detailed information in any other source.	2004-01-17
US	52749744	R331ZI20C107HB	068484821X	673683691	Buffettology: The Previously Unexplained Techniques That Have Made Warren Buffett The Worlds	Books	4	55	58	N	N	Ex-Buffett on  Buffett	Probably the best of the Buffett books. Mary isn't part of the Buffett gang anymore, so she doesn't have anything to protect, just plenty to tell. <BR>Mary Buffett and David Clark spell out Buffett's methodology as well as anybody. But once you get into the meat of the book, you realize that Buffett had (and has) a lot of advantages over most other investors. That, in and of itself, doesn't take away from the genius behind the method, just that you aren't going to approximate his returns without a lot of luck.<BR>Particularly interesting is that many of his \\"great\\" purchases were made either when the market had momentarily beaten down a good company, or when the market in general was on the ropes. Both situations recall the sage advice to \\"buy when blood is running in the streets.\\" Sadly, most investors are usually loaded up with stocks (and paper losses) and without the wherewithal to buy more when these panics hit. <BR>That's where Buffett's business strategy comes in. By investing heavily in insurance companies early and often, he's the beneficiary of a steady stream of cash, ready to be put to use whenever the opportunity presents itself.<BR>The authors' advice to mimic Buffett in seeking out consumer \\"monopolies\\" with intangible assets is good; \\"an unregulated monopoly that the world hasn't recognized yet,\\" as they say. However, thousands of Wall Street's brightest are hard at work all day and into the night looking for those same jewels. So you'll have plenty of competition.<br />Two problems arise from this type of book. The first is that the assumptions made about the expected growth of earnings/dividends over the course of the next 10 years can easily go astray. The business environment is changing rapidly. Long-range predictions haven't held up well recently (and frequently don't). The second problem is one of practicality. Do you actually have the resources and time to do the footwork that a Buffett or a Peter Lynch can do? If so, then maybe you'll be thenext superstar. Otherwise, you'll have to find an easier way of going after that 20+% return year after year.	2004-01-16

The Dow 36,000 Theory is all about predicting a paradigm shift in current investors' perceptions. Tomorrow's investors are expected to forsake the old paradigm and embrace a new one. Authors James K. Glassman and Kevin A. Hassett present the \\"discounted dividend\\" model of the stock market as their reason why stock prices will soar, eventually. In 1999, they said it could happen anytime but put a window on it of 3-5 years. Hasn't happened yet. But this book is important as a look-see into how academic constructs originate and work their way into \\"commonly accepted stock market wisdom.\\" The P/E was once a kernel of an idea in someone's head. Now, it's the basic way to value stocks. So, conceptions do change over time.<BR>Dividends, say Glassman and Hassett, whether paid out quarterly or totally retained in the company, are the only important way to determine a company's true worth. They call it the PRP (perfectly reasonable price).<BR>To justify lofty expectations, the words \\"assume\\" and \\"assumption\\" are used dozens of times and lie at the bottom of what, so far, is wrong with this concept. Just because they calculate something as being worth many times what it's selling for today doesn't mean prices will skyrocket tomorrow. It requires acknowledgement and action by investors. We're back to the old high school conundrum of whether a tree makes any noise if it falls in a forest without anybody hearing it. It this case, the question is whether a stock will ever sell at its \\"true value\\" if nobody ever bids the price up that far? Obviously not. <BR>Their credo, \\"Buy anytime, hold forever,\\" as well as the recommended use of index funds is a recipe for never having to admit you're wrong regardless of what happens to your investment account. You never have to confront performance because that far away goal just hasn't been reached yet. Continue to hold. It's an enviable position, if you can get people to take you seriously. But Dow 36,000...is it possible? Sure, anything ispossible if the paradigm shifts. It's shifted before and will shift again. The trouble with paradigm shifts is like Greenspan's recognition of a bubble. You won't know about it until it's already happened...and then it's too late,,,	2004-01-16

Although it contains only 276 pages of commentary, its scope envisions a brave new world we can only imagine and argue about. No doubt the outcome of the argument will weigh heavily on our future for years to come. Professor Robert J. Shiller needs no introduction. Whether by intent or luck, his \\"Irrational Exuberance\\" warning about our overvalued stock market was published around the time NASDAQ topped out just above 5000 (March 2000). The rest is history. And while I, as a former member of two options exchanges, certainly welcome any suggestion to increase the trading opportunities available to us today, the six innovative financial instruments he proposes to reduce/share risk leave a lot to be explained, both mechanically and philosophically. The book, though, rates five stars for its thought-provoking ideas and for the stature that Shiller brings to them. There's a lot in this book and nothing in it should be discarded without extensive study and reflection. One of life's hardest lessons to accept is that none of us, either individually or collectively, can ignore the dynamic world we live in. Sitting still is not an option because of the relative motion of everyone else in the world. Our only choices are, in the immortal words of Lee Iacocca, \\"Lead, follow, or get out of the way.\\" Today's informational databases were sure to evoke something like Shiller's ideas. It is useless to turn our heads because it will happen. Therefore the intent of this book should be exposed to the largest possible number of people because what we decide will determine how we spend the rest of our lives. On the surface, Dr. Shiller would be creating a Dr. Pangloss world, but the devil would be in the details.<BR>The most obvious aspect of Shiller's proposals is that he would use classical capitalistic markets to achieve classical socialistic goals. A most creative feat in and of itself. Insuring against risk, of course, is nothing new. Lloyd's of London datesback to Edward Lloyd's coffeehouse in the late 1680s. But not only does Shiller want to mitigate the risk of error in individual decision making, he also wants to insure \\"society\\" against the collective mistakes of all. It will be interesting to see which power groups line up on which side of the argument. Maybe he isn't proposing cradle-to-grave socialism, but certainly something close to young-professional-through-retirement risk sharing as administered/regulated by a combination of governmental/financial superbodies. <BR>He convincingly begins his presentation with a short history of how new innovations are always refuted at first, then eventually work their way into our lives. This is a good start to set the stage for his own ground-breaking ideas.<BR>There is no point in going over the mechanics of the proposals because they will see many different permutations before they ever become tradable entities, but more important are the goals and philosophy that pushes them all.<BR>His first proposal covers personal insurance: livelihood insurance to reduce the risk of people embarking on a dead-end profession. He is inspired here by the very legitimate concern that society losses out on tremendous talent when gifted individuals steer away from professions that might not pay off in the future. He feels that if we insure them against this failure, their contributions will pay off in the long run. Also included in personal insurance is his proposal for home equity insurance to guard against a decline in your home's value. He's already put his money where his mouth is by incubating such a company and then selling it to a financial conglomerate.<BR>Next is MacroMarkets. Here he envisions GDP futures to enable trading in national economies based on how they perform. One of the benefits here would be when a country's GDP begins to weaken, it would be a signal to the affected economy's leaders that something must be done to remedy the situation or else things will get worse.<BR>Third, he addresses banking and income-linked loans. Interest rates on loans would rise or fall with one's income, region, or profession, and could be used to modify or eliminate current bankruptcy laws. However, could a bank stay solvent by lending money on fluctuating terms unless it could also pay interest on fluctuating terms? We've just lived through the S & L crisis borne out of this same scenario.<BR>Fourth, he tackles his most inflammatory subject, that of income inequality. His basic fear here, along with Dr. Ravi Batra and others, is that increasing disparity of income leads to riots, revolutions, and war. But who decides what is fair and equitable? And would an earlier leveling effect have robbed us of the builders Carnegie, Rockefeller, and Ford up through Walton and Gates?<BR>Fifth - Intergenerational social security. This is the most pressing problem today and will cause the most heated debates going forward. What is fair can be debated until we all die of old age.<BR>Last, he would like to set up swaps between rich and poor, strong and weak nations based on their GDPs. But what happens when politicians are accused of \\"exporting jobs\\" like companies are today? They won't be in office very long. The IMF doesn't have a great record getting the masses to toe the line either when it comes to living up to prior agreements.<BR>The scariest ingredient of all Shiller's proposals is the collection, retrieval  and analysis of masses of amounts of information (GRID) needed to administer such an interconnected trading arrangement. Yet, the Internet is making us one people, and Shiller's financial instruments would make us one world, interconnected, co-dependent, and risk-sharing. If Clausewitz was right that war is politics by other means, then perhaps politics is economics by other means. Maybe the time has come for economics to supercede politics and maybe Shiller is showing the way. He does have a vision. Do we want to be part of it or not?	2004-01-09

Shiller's prescient publication in March 2000, right near NASDAQ topping out around 5000, is to see what relevance it has for us today. He begins with 12 factors he believes played a major role in creating the bull market/boom/bubble of the late 1990s, and ends with an assessment of which of those 12 will continue to play an influential role going forward. That, too, should be our concern.<BR>First, let me say that his deconstruction of the \\"efficient market theory\\" probably has more lasting importance in the financial world than his assessment of whether we had an overvalued stock market, and should be taken to heart by everyone who wants to make money in the stock market. In over a decade as a member of two securities exchanges, I never found any evidence that the random walk or efficient market theories had any significance in real world finance. An ivory tower construct, for sure.<BR>Prof. Shiller's 12 reasons for the 1990s boom and their current/future influence:<BR>1. The Internet: It remains a viable growth engine, but got ahead of itself. The Internet continues as a strong influence on business and the stock market. <BR>2. Decline of foreign competition: Our victory over communist economies is waning. New competition (China) will emerge on the world scene.<BR>3: Pro business culture: Could easily turn against the market. <BR>4. Pro business governmental policies: Could easily turn against the market.<BR>5. Life cycles - Baby Boomers: He expects the positive effect to diminish. <BR>6: Financial press reporting: Probably will continue but not show much growth.<BR>7: Optimistic analysts: Can easily turn negative.<BR>8: Retirement plans: Social Security is a potential plus if redirected into stocks.<BR>9. Growth of mutual funds: Difficult to ascertain. <BR>10: Decline of inflation: Can't get lower; can only get worse. <BR>11: Day trading/increased public participation: Likely to continue. More people's access could elevate prices. <BR>12: Rise of national gambling culture: He admits the connection between gambling and the stock market is weak.<BR>Prof. Shiller is pro-markets. His concern is whether outrage over the bursting of irrational bubbles might do irreparable harm including turning our society against our capitalistic and free-market institutions. On this point he eloquently states, \\"Speculative markets perform critical resource-allocation functions (a point I have taken for granted and have not focused on in this book), and any interference with markets to tame bubbles interferes with these functions as well. Ultimately, in a free society, we cannot protect people from all the consequences of their own actions. We cannot protect people completely without denying them the possibility of achieving their own fulfillment. We cannot completely protect society from the effects of waves of irrational exuberance or irrational pessimism - emotional reactions that are themselves part of the human condition.\\" (p233).<br />Perhaps this is why under the subject of what role government might play in cooling down irrationality before it becomes destructive, I did not notice any reference to the FRB's role of setting margin rates on stock purchases. This power (Reg T) was created precisely to cool down speculative markets when they get too hot. Greenspan, for whatever reason, chose not to invoke this tool during the boom.<BR>In the end, Prof. Shiller blames investors for their blind exuberance and predicts more difficult times ahead. Indeed, his fears have been borne out the past 3 years. But even he does not rule out another run based on new factors and old psychology because not only is it human to err, but also it is human to be irrational. The solution? In his words, \\"It may be that the best stabilizing influence on markets is to broaden them, allowing as many people to trade as often as possible.\\" This is why in his next book, \\"The New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century\\" (2003) (see my review), Prof. Shiller confronts how government and society can work together to mitigate future emotional disruptions to our everyday lives through market-based instruments.	2004-01-09
US	52749744	R1LW8MAZ9Q4YUB	0671891634	888454147	Beating the Street	Books	3	15	16	N	N	Easy for you to say	Lynch's story is a good account of how a top performing mutual fund manager (better than 25% a year over 13 years) accomplishes a superior track record, but it's a poor how-to manual for the individual investor. Unfortunately, you will not have the access to all the brokers, analysts, and CEOs that Lynch had by merely picking up the phone. Also, most investors do not have his knowledge of finance and business practice intricacies. Thus, his advice has to be taken with this in mind. Still, he's something of a genius and you can benefit from his experience. <BR>His insight into why mutual fund ownership is not a good way to invest (due to philosophy, fees, size, past performance ratings, etc.) is timely advice today in light of recent revelations exposed by NY Attorney General Elliott Spitzer. But his best argument against investing in mutual funds has to be, \\"You never know where the next great opportunity will be, so don't get stuck in a fund that won't take advantage of it.\\" The good thing about Lynch is that not only does he believe money can be made in the stock market year in and year out, but he's also proven it. It's just too bad that approximating his record the way he recommends is a real stretch.<BR>His \\"buy what you know\\" and \\"check out the local malls\\" makes profitable investing sound easier than it really is. Just because your local clothier is prospering doesn't mean the store in the same chain 3000 miles away is also doing a bang-up business or that corporate headquarters has got its head on straight.<BR>One area that I wished he'd commented on more was point of entry - when to buy. He talked a lot about liking a stock but missing out on it until it had already rallied a goodly percent. The old adage in Wall Street says \\"I'd rather buy a bad stock at a good price than a good stock at a bad price.\\" Translation: Every stock has an optimum entry point and if you miss it, you shouldn't chase it. Find another gem. He doesn't seem to agree. He's looking forhis \\"10 baggers.\\" Stocks that appreciate 1000%. He does stress that the long term stock market return is somewhere around 8% - something we all forgot in the late 90s. So that means there aren't that many 10 baggers around. <BR>Another weakness is his dependence on company reported earnings growth. We've just been through enough scandals to educate us to the fact that \\"earnings\\" frequently can be whatever someone wants them to be.<BR>The last half of the book gets bogged down in his thought processes as he finds, researches, and picks his big winners. The mental work is revealing and does have merit in learning how good stock pickers think, but again, it's not something an individual investor can master as easily as Lynch makes it out to be. Remember, he admits he retired early because of too many 24/7s on the job, whereas the individual investor has to work with what can be easily and accurately obtained.	2003-12-31

The basic story revolves around FBI profiler Terry McAleb's need for, acquisition of, and resulting complications from receiving a life-giving heart donation from a murder victim. Although Connelly's work is good in itself, Brian Helgeland's screenplay makes the story come alive in ways the book cannot. Clint Eastwood has been criticized for many aspects of his self-directing, self-producing, and self-starring roles, but the movie works and it is much more entertaining than the book. The May-September Wanda De Jesus-Eastwood romance enhances the story's theme of renewal of life and adds more poignancy than is possible in the book where the two characters are closer in age. Although Paul Rodriguez's over-the-top performance as the PO'd Latino detective is distracting (albeit, with some funny lines), I think it brings out the ethnic interplay of the characters and the environment better than the book does. After all, this is LA, and this is today. But where the movie really shines is in the portrayal of the villain. In the book, we catch only fleeting glimpses of the killer and never hear about his motives from him. However, in the movie, the villain is an integral part of the story. His life and motives may be a little too obvious and perhaps subtract from the suspense, but the book doesn't do any better job of fleshing out evil. The ending also shines in the movie but falls short in the book. Connelly gave us little dread or anticipation. The movie delivers both, not only with Eastwood's constant concern about his heart transplant going bad and a violent bout with a burly Russian, but also with the final confrontation between Eastwood and the killer himself.<BR>All in all, an okay book, a better movie, but not an all-nighter.	2003-12-26

Havana, Miami, Las Vegas, Palm Beach, New York, and Harvard. Capitalism, communism, Khrushchev, spy versus spy, double agents, triple agents, moles, and one Tom Jefferson (alias Marty van Buren) (alias Franklin Pierce), hit man. This rip roaring trip back to the early `60s, complete with movie stars, gangsters, politicians, entertainers, ball players, blue suede shoes, and cherry coca will immerse you into nostalgia like few thrillers do. Characters that made the headlines some 40 years ago walk off the pages as you listen in on the plotting and back stabbing of the then-famous power brokers.<BR>Kerr's work is not so much a page turner of what happens next as it is a rich tapestry of the hows and whys of history in the making. Eavesdrop on bigger-than-life hoods and pols maneuvering for advantage. Watch while the little people get caught in the crossfire. And wonder if it really did happen this way. But don't look for a protagonist: it's not here. What is here is the early `60s milieu, in spades - and that's your leading character.	2003-11-10
