Thomas Wild  with Anita Uhl Brothers, M.D., and Nerves In Collision by Walter C.  Alvarez, M.D.  These other books report that consciousness can be  dramatically impacted by a limited number of FDA approved medicines in ways  not even mentioned by Antonio Damasio, in ways which provide deeper and  more scientific insights into paying attention, memory, fine motor control,  and the difference between what the mind is and what the brain is.  That's  my view.  Damasio is mediocre at best in his discussion of what is really  known about the mechanism of attention and consciousness.  Damasio is  presenting 25 year old information from the point of view of a doctor with  a mediocre understanding of the nature of neurological consciousness vs  clients who know better.  It's the case of who is one to believe, the  doctor who has perfect hearing or the client with CAPD (Central Auditory  Processing Disorder) who can hear better with the right medicine.  There is  better and far more insightful data available about human consciousness  than what Damasio wants readers to believe is available but it may not fit  into Damasio's agenda of self-promotion as the rule is:  listen to the  doctor, the client doesn't matter.  If these are seen as politically  incorrect comments, you're right, they likely are, but I personally prefer  real gold to fool's gold despite all the exhortations that they're all the  same - facts don't matter;  only what the doctor says matter;  on the  contrary, facts do matter and what the client says matters more;  it's  their consciousness, not the doctor's. End of politically incorrect  comments.  Damasio's book is not trash but it is mediocre information.   Other books provide greater and more repoducible insights, the known  hallmarks of good science.  Thank you for reading this review.	2000-06-07

Robert T. Kiyosaki is right in that the ideas in rich people's heads are vastly different than the ideas in poor people's heads.  Apparently Kiyosaki is gradually creating a productline of books and games about money  along the lines of other motivational speakers and authors like Earl  Nightingale and Tony Robbins.  He's offering an expensive boardgame (about  $195/Cashflow 101) with a second boardgame Cashflow 201, the advanced game,  coming next.  Personally I lean towards getting all the most basic ideas in  one product vs an endless series of continuing financial education courses.   Kiyosaki does talk about solid financial ideas which often in the real  world are not freely talked about.  Robert T. Kiyosaki (with Sharon L.  Lechter) - thank you.	2000-05-09

Books	5	22	24	N	N	Gives a simple process for goal setting	People tend to become what they think about all the time or almost all the time (as in a dominant thought).  Joe Karbo explains how to invent affirmations for yourself which work.  He encourages you to repeat these  written ideas at least twice daily, once in the morning and once in the  evening.  By setting and saying these affirmations designed to gradually  improve all areas of your life, you can become more successful in both your  professional, business life and in your personal, family life.  This  process worked for Karbo and in some cases it took repeating the same idea  year in and year out for the idea to actually materialize.  Persistence  paid off.  One surprising hint Karbo provided in my view was that he said  affirmations are more effective when written in the present tense vs some  other tense so as to engage the imagination and the subconscious mind, for  example, someone who was starting at the low end of the economic ladder  would write a financial affirmation like &quot;I am a millionaire&quot; or  someone who wanted a better relationship with his wife would write &quot;I  am a loving and kind husband.&quot;  That style of expression tended to  engage the process which turns an idea into reality.	2000-03-16

The memory course overlooks looking at memory from a  neurological standpoint, that is, it's known today (2000) that there are a  number of subtle neurological challenges which involve memory  challenges/sequencing difficulties such as ADHD, ADD, Hyperactivity,  Dyslexia, and Absence Epilepsy for which there is evidence that the right  medicine can temporarily improve memory far more than teaching techniques  which are aimed at most of the population who are free of known  neurological deficits.	2000-02-10

Very few books have possessed the ability to grab my imagination and create a new world.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has.  Clearly a gifted storyteller, J.K. Rowling is a craftsperson who can invent a large  family of believable characters from all walks of life in my view.  Parts  of Harry Potter are about the ideas of good and evil vs the idea that there  are only shades of gray in the struggle for false power, greed, and  ambition.  To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great  adventure and life is, well: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! and Love!  The book mirrors global society in 1999 it seems to me by presenting a  post-Christian point-of-view to several major and formerly religious  holidays such as Christmas and Easter presenting them more in terms of  secular outings/festivities vs traditional days of high Christian spiritual  holydays celebrating events in the life of Jesus Christ.  Harry Potter  mixes the world of witches and wizards with a post-Christian world invented  through Rowling's vivid imagination.	1999-10-13

He made a fortune (dollarwise) yet was married many times, seeing women as another kind of wine to be enjoyed yet admitting that perhaps he would have been happier in  life with perhaps a modest income and only a single mate throughout his  lifetime.  He distinguishes between a true entrepreneur (like himself) vs  others with almost the same God-given talent who do not achieve business  goals as effectively as he does.  J. Paul Getty was a very thoughtful man  who I believe cared, in his own imperfect way, for society and for the  people who worked for him.  In my view, J. Paul Getty did give back to the  community some of the financial rewards he received by serving the  community well with a good solid business idea.  Thank you J.

The subtitle to this book, Direct from Dell, is Strategies That Revolutionized An Industry meaning that instead of building a computer first and then hoping a customer would want to purchase it, Dell would ask  the customer exactly what he/she wanted and then build a custom computer at  a fair/affordable price.  In my view, that is where is his success springs  from.  Dell also provides an extremely rare look at how a billion dollar  company looks at metrics, especially ROIC<br />(return-on-invested-capital).   ROIC is a measure of how effectively Dell creates shareholder value  relative to its cost of capital. ROIC Drivers include:  pricing, product  mix, and volume;  sales force productivity;  forecasting;  transformation  costs;  material costs;  R&amp;D and I/S costs;  capacity management;  out-of-box audit; logistics - inbound/outbound; quality customer service;  accounts receivable terms and timing; inventory terms and delivery;   backlog/lead times; excess and obsolete risks; accounts payable terms and  timing; facilities management;  and, IBU risk/currency risk.  This book  clearly displays many keywords and how a highly successful CEO uses them.   Dell has a track record which is quite extraordinary it seems to me,  meaning, he is worth listening to as the man has walked the talk.  No one  can predict the future but Michael Dell is doing a lot of things right and  in my view the future looks bright for Dell.  Thank you, Michael Dell, for  sharing how you look at Dell Computer Corporation.  This book focuses  almost exclusively on the Dell Corporation so don't expect very much  insight into any other companies. When the current computer I am using  needs to be replaced I will certainly check out Dell at that time.  The  book includes a small poster which explains Dell's revolutionary  Build-To-Customer Order process.	1999-04-10

Books	5	3	4	N	N	If you want to be rich, you've got to read &amp; understand #s.	An asset is something that puts money in your pocket.  If you want to be rich, simply spend life buying assets.  Gradually acquire assets such as bonds, intellectual property, notes, real estate and stock as assets generate dividends, interest, rental income, and royalties.  If you want to  be poor or middle class, spend life buying liabilities such as consumer  loans, credit cards, and mortgages.  If you want to be rich, you've got to  read and understand numbers.  Emotions such as fear and desire are what  make people human.  Emotion stands for energy in motion.  Be truthful about  emotions and use your mind and emotions in constructive ways.  Most people  do not know that it's their emotions such as fear and desire that are doing  their thinking.  Take action.  By acquiring assets you will be choosing  wealth as your goal and your future.  The choice is yours.  You most likely  will not be taught in school how to gradually become rich.  You will most  likely be gradually taught how to be a good employee and a good consumer vs  a good employer and a good asset acquirer.	1999-03-10

It's far better to buy a  wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.   When buying companies or common stocks, Buffett looks for first-class  businesses accompanied by first-class managements.

Ray Kroc, thank you for  standardizing good, low cost meals.	1998-10-17

Much of the appeal is from the title and using the word power in my view.   The book is essentially an invitation to become a Christian. The Bible  itself is a better basic book for that it seems to me.  The book could  possibly be retitled The Power of Christian Thinking.  Parts of The Power  of Positive Thinking are excellent yet many parts are full of fluff  (spiritual-psycho babble) in my view.	1998-10-16

There are other books about Dilantin, like Nerves In Collision by  Walter C. Alvarez, M.D., but Jack Dreyfus's account is quite exceptional.   The only other book I know which compares to it is How to Cure  Hyperactivity (ADHD)(1981) by Anita Uhl Brothers, M.D., of Berkeley,  California and C. Thomas Wild which is about an FDA approved caffeine  compound which can reduce distractibility and increase attention span a  little for a small subpopulation of those with mild Attention Deficit  Disorder (ADD).	1998-10-16

Dr. Schuller was correct, in my view. This  translation is quite beautiful and very easy to read.  Previously I had  read another translation in English which was frankly quite poorly and  unevenly done.  This New King James Version, Possibility Thinkers Bible,  brought the Bible to life for me in everyday, beautiful English.  My thanks  go to the translators of the New King James Version.  You did a wonderful  job for the Lord God/Jesus Christ.	1998-10-16

Whether the vision is to spread the  gospel to every living person on planet earth or to belt the globe with  Ford motor cars or to put a computer on every desk in every  home in the  world, many of the principles used are given in this single book, Think and  Grow Rich.  The book also presents the value of a Boardroom (often of 50 or  more people) who collectively can come up with better answers, remedies,  and solutions than a single person ever can (through group discussions,  amendments, and votes).  Quite a book!	1998-10-15

He explained the real  value in looking at things from the customer's point-of-view vs mine. He  basically said that praise raises and uplifts while criticism kills and  gums up the machinery. He said that most men and women are motivated by a  set of motives which are not generally taught in the public educational  system or from the preacher's pulpit as being the real motives behind what  lots of people do.  He explained human nature to me and allowed me to get  along with all sorts of people a little better. I thank God for Dale  Carnegie's honesty and his insights into the gift of empathy.  He was a  very smart man.  I have used some of his techniques on occasion and they do  indeed work.	1998-10-15
