US	50806303	R1472006YE3SGV	1564765865	728146993	Body Dynamic	Books	5	0	10	N	N	Classic	Long considered the classic volume on the Chesapeake Bay country.  In it famous figures live again: Captain John Smith, known to every school child as the man rescued by Pocahontas, who said of the Eastern Shore of virginia: \\"Heaven & earth seemed never to have agreed better to have framed a place for man's habitation,\\" and whose explorations were such an integral part of the history of the regions; Francis Scott Key, who was inspired to write \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" aboard a British ship which was bombarding Fort McHenry; signers of the Declaration of Independence. <br /> <br />But if the reader is given new insights into familiar personalities & their exploits, he is also made privy to tales concerning lesser known persons & places which are no less interesting.  Many of these, described in brief, could well be the nuclei of whole novels. <br /> <br />There is, for example, the tale of Colonel George Talbot of St. Mary's County, a member of the Council, who had an altercation with the King's Collector-General & fatalaly stabbed him.  Fearful that he could not receive a fair trial in Maryland, he had a change of venue made to Virginia, then subsequently received permission to go to England.  But by that time he had already fled the environs.  Legend has it that he found a haven in a distant manor in Cecil County, took refuge in a case, and was fed by two trained hawks who brought him wild fowl from the river to serve as sustenance. <br /> <br />Or there is the story of Tulip Hill in Anne Arundel County, an outstanding example of colonial architecture at its best.  Sometimes known as the \\"Old Galloway Place,\\" when it was being built Mrs. Galloway was an invalid, and the staircase was therefore constructed with exceptionally easy rises.  It is reported that one of the Galloway sons returned from the capital one night in such high spirits after an evening of revelry that he rode his horse straight up to his room. Which may explain the print of a rough-shod horse'shooves on the stairs, which one can discern if one looks closely. <br /> <br />What material for a romantic historical novel in the section on the \\"Taney Place,\\" the birthplace of Chief Justice Roger Taney & the site of a duel between Miles Taney & John Magruder, both of whom were smitten by the same beautiful Baltimore belle.  During the course of a festive dinner Taney made a remark about the lady, which angered Magruder to such a point that the latter, undoubedly encouraged by a generous consumption of wine, slapped his rival's face.  Whereupon Taney drew his pocket knife and stabbed Magruder through the heart.  Then, aided by his slaves & the darkness of the night, he escaped through a secret passage & made his way out of the state.  <br /> <br />How Hope House was sold for a case of spirits, how Bowie Racetrack got its name, why early colonists burned down plantation houses to secure the nails used in building them - these are but a few of the nuggets to be found in this historical treasure chest. <br /> <br />And the copioous photographs of boats, landscapes, the exteriors & interiors of houses, persons & college campuses add visual enchantment to the text while reminding Americans of the richness of their artistic & historical heritage.	2005-09-18

Combined with man's deep & timeless appreciation of nature & constant need to find beauty, the scientific curiosity of the enlightenment, the relationships underling Darwin's theories, the twentieth century's preoccupation w/form & structure-all have found expression in American flower painting. <br /> <br />This book brings together in one volume the most beautuful exapmples of the genre:: floral paintings, drawings, pastels, & watercolors, many of them reproduced in full color.  Included are delicate & precise drawings & studies by the botanist artists of the 18th century: Mark Catesby, William Bartram, & of the fertility & variety of the New World.  In contrast are the opulent still lifes, by such 19th century masters as Severin Roesen, george Henry hall, & George Cocgran Lambdin; the romantic landscapes of Frederic E. Church; and the lush tropical panoramas of Marten John son Heode. <br /> <br />Certainly one of he most popular movements in european art, Impressonism, has its American counterpart in the abundantly beautiful gardents of Childe hassam, Winslow Lomer, John La Farge,& Maria Oakey Dewing.  And with the 20th century come stylistically diverse examples of floral imagery in the work of Georgia O'Keee, charles demurth, arshile Gorky, Joseph Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, and Jennifer Bartlett.  These & many other artists are represented in this magnificent collection, which is accompanied by Ella M. Foshay's lively & scholarly test. <br /> <br />Reflections of Nature is a lovely volume that will be a value to artists, art historians, & anyone with an appreciation of american art & the extraordinary beauty found in & around the garden.	2005-08-11

Believers and skeptics share common ground only in ceding few points & showing little tolerance of their opponents. <br /> <br />While the commentators argue, many who have undergone abductions are angry & bewildered.   They have been shaken to the core by their experiences, and want explanations & reassurance.  While many abductees support abduction researchers wholeheartedly, a significant number are disenchanged with them.  Both groups despair at the dismissal & scorn of hardline skeptics. <br /> <br />This book presents an overview of both sides of the abduction argument, but it goes much further than that.  A number of researchers have now recognized that something truly strange lies at the heart of the abduction experience, even though it may not involve actual alien beings.  A few have realized that, regardless of whether abductions are really happening, the stories told by abductees and the apparent activities of the aliens have achieved the status of a modern mythology. <br /> <br />Alien Abductions ruthlessly exposes the assumptions & delusions of both the promoters of the abduction phenomenon & their most intolerant critics.  At the same time, the author gives an objective account of the witnesses themselves, their sense of betrayal & confusion, and he striking variety of their experiences.  This book includes previously unpublished artworks & photographs - some from private collections, others commissioned especially for this book - as well as exclusive interviews with abductees, offering a thought-provoking perspective on the abduction experience.  Believers & skeptics alike will find this an unforgettable expose of alien encounters.	2005-06-26

Only Ralph Waldo emerson hailed Whitman \\"at the beginning of a great careet.\\"  Today Whitman is revered for his accomplishment, and many of his poems are admired as among America's finest: the exquisite personal meditation of \\"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking\\"; the celebraton of the human body & spitit in song of Myself; the paeans to companionship of the Calamus poems; and the landmark elegy for Abraham Lincoln, \\"When Lilacs Last in the dooryard Bloom'd.

Mommsen describes Rome's acquisition and ultimate control of Gaul, Spain, Britain, the Danubian lands, as well as Greece and Asia Minor.  He then discusses at equal length Rome's difficult dominion in Egypt, Judaea, Syria, the North African territories, and the frontiers along the Euphrates.<br />The Provinces of the Roman Empire was originally published as two volumes in Mommen's magnificent multivolume History of Rome, a life's work that contributed to his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1902.  (The award was given for Mommen's eloquent style-the work itself is first-rate historical scholarship.) That Mommsen structured these two volumes as a work that could stand alone within his larger istory is made clar in his introduction, and has been affirmed by later historians.	2004-07-18
