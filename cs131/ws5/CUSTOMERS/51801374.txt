I was seven or so when this occured. and i remember  his rather stiff and aloof demeanor during religious services. anyway, i was too young to make sense of any of his sermons. but every time he stood in front of the congregation, I would keep picturing the rabbi, with the bandage over his eye and the blood soaked shirt. he achieved a somewhat heroic stature as a result of this constant visualization    this book, alas, by his son, brings the rabbi down to earth. not maliciously, but in a careful, circumspect way, we see a man defined by his son who, in his seventh decade is still trying to define himself as a welter of repressed memories surfaced. one walks away from this sad, sad book hoping to have read these words from rabbi to son, \\" I love you, son.\\"  joe does tell his father that he loves him, but by then, the rabbi is lying in a vegetative state as a result of a brain tumor. the father can't hear the son. or respond to him. now, that's a painful memory loop.  memories, after all, are for the living.	2005-04-30

Then why was I disappointed when the heavy tome  arrived?  its size makes it too unwieldly to read, especially in bed where  i normally read all my harper's magazines. it's like going to bed with a  cement block. granted there are some wonderful essays (read: the history of  the magazine parallels the cyclical highs and lows of publishing in this  country), some stand out in greater relief, such as trotsky's warning about  hitler. there's something to be said about reading journalism as history,  and this collection won't disappoint. plus, there are some of my favorite  essays of a recent vintage--david foster wallace on the state fair or  richard rodriguez on san francisco's new gentilty. in any case, buy this  book if you have strong biceps; otherwise, content yourself with the  stellar monthly magazine.	2000-05-26

Napolean was a lucky and brilliant leader,  whose quick tactical thinking led to surprising truimphs, but even he  acknowlwedges at the end that what had defeated him  was not another army  or leader but General Danube--the river. A force of nature, Napolean met  his match with the Danube. Just wait til he experiences the Russian winter   in a few years.	2000-05-21
