Its people, from craftsmen to priests and priestesses, are now refugees seeking a new home. <br /> <br />The horrific situation in which they find themselves is an opportunity for an author to build to climax after climax, to give her readers a roller-coaster of a ride.  Having read Ms. Paxson's Hallowed Isles series, I expected as much. <br /> <br />It wasn't there. <br /> <br />The characters are flat and wishy-washy.  The women are way too upbeat.  (Did they have Happy Pills in 2,000 B.C.?)  A princess, Damisa, promised to be interesting, but she turns out to be only slightly less milquetoasty.  Micail, a priest and prince, and supposedly one of the wisest, is convinced that a foolish assumption is true. <br /> <br />The priestesses are almost always smiling, walking on the sunny side of the street.  That outlook seems to come not from wisdom, spirituality and knowledge, but from a lack. <br /> <br />As for the story, there's little edge or conflict.  Oh, there's plenty of potential for it!  Which makes it all the more disappointing that such opportunities are blanched over.  Everyone's just so gosh-darn nice. <br /> <br />I liked the beginning, the sense of history it gave.  And I like how \\"magic\\" is presented, as a real force that, used properly, maintains a balance of Earth's powers; how the loss of their islands is the result of good intentions gone bad (though evil intentions would've given the story some kick). <br /> <br />I wonder if Ms. Paxson may have felt restrained by carrying on MZB's mission.  Perhaps her hands were tied and she wasn't given free reign to write the story in her own way? <br /> <br />It's a pleasant read, but only a mildly interesting one.	2005-07-23

This is an excellent resource for those of us not yet fluent in Latin. <br /> <br />Each of the 555 verbs has several sentences using the verb, in the original Latin (no simplification, at least with the quotes I checked), with English translations (aah!). Writers whose works are quoted include Ovid, Vergil, Lucretius, Tacitus, Livy and Cicero. <br /> <br />It has Top 40 verbs. For each of these 40, in addition to the regular page that fully conjugates the verb, the following page has a dozen or more definitions for that one verb.  <br /> <br />For instance, there are 17 definitions for \\"traho/trahere.\\" Each definition has one to three original Classical Latin sentences using the verb in that particular context. <br /> <br />Limited to those 40 verbs, \\"555\\" is better than most dictionaries. <br /> <br />If I had to complain (aside from the MTV lingo), the text could be a little darker, and the separation between sections within the conjugation (indicative, subjunctive, etc.) could be more distinctive.  Minor stuff.  Forget I said it. <br /> <br />Macrons are included; altogether there are 3,400 Latin sentences as examples; a separate section for irregular verbs; a cross-referenced index with 2,500 verbs; and an English-to-Latin verb index. <br /> <br />I can't praise THE BIG GOLD BOOK OF LATIN VERBS highly enough!  I urge everyone studying Latin to invest in this book.	2004-10-11

Because I think I have. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a book with a well-defined plot and clear-cut characters, this isn't it. <br /> <br />BLACKBIRD HOUSE has no sharp edges.  Rather, it's about blurred boundaries between water and land, organs and skin, love and hate, life and death, conscious and subconscious.  The inner and the outer.  Seeming contradictions that come to make perfect sense. <br /> <br />It's about different ways people can be lost (`at sea'), find home (even if they've been there all along), shape their lives or let circumstance take over, love, die, be wounded, heal. <br /> <br />Alice Hoffman skillfully maneuvers a thin line, finding a balance between the limited part of existence about which our senses inform us, and what lies beyond ordinary senses.  She's created a place where everything has meaning, though that's not necessarily a comforting thing; it's simply what is. <br /> <br />Although it has what may seem to be fantastical touches, BH is not a fantasy, nor is it a New Age-y, feel-good read.  It's about aspects of reality some shrug off as imagination, a trick of light or last night's bad clams. <br /> <br />If you give BLACKBIRD HOUSE half a chance, you'll find its truth and beauty -- the type of truth and beauty that are as likely to prick as they are to placate. <br /> <br />Threads of metaphor abound: red and red-related colors, black, fish, birds, snow, cold, feet, cows, milk.  And of course the blackbird (which isn't, really).	2004-10-06

A couple of characters grab you from the start; the others are skillfully developed within the context of the story. <br />As best as I can judge, the writing is excellent. All our senses are indulged: I found myself wrinking my nose at the smells, seeing the colors, hearing the sounds of 15th century Florence. A suspenseful page-turner, you're kept on pins and needles waiting to see what happens next!<br />Ms. Dunant's research (as I found out after finishing the book) is impeccable. What an enjoyable way to learn!<br />Though it's a fast and fun read, by no means is this a throw-away romance. Come to think of it, it isn't all that much of a romance. A certain intelligence is assumed on the part of the reader, and I like that.<br />What else can I say? I didn't want BIRTH OF VENUS to end.	2004-06-29

I love symbolism, and have enjoyed many novels most find too weird and 'out there.'  But ORACLE NIGHT just plain lost me.<br />There was no sense of connection between several episodes.

A couple of secondary characters push the limits of belief; then again, one theme explored in the story is the thin line between borders: sanity and insanity, life and death, real and surreal, dreams and wakefulness.<br />As always, Koontz's dry wit and gift for understatement tickle me pink! I'd read his books for the humor alone.<br />For the most part, descriptions are kept simple: Rather than account for every millimeter of space in a scene, a sentence or two summarize the 'feel' the objects give a scene and what they say about the character associated with them. Teasing hints of what's to come help to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />Literary and cultural allusions made for fun reading, and kept me feeling close to the story and people. The wonderfully colorful language is a thing of beauty.<br />Scenes of horror and evil will chill you to the bone; scenes of love in its many aspects will touch you to the core. That they're often juxtaposed heightens their power. One sterling example: the scene at the Church of the Whispering Comet.<br />I do have one complaint: I found the 'main event' disappointing. Both the writing and Odd suddenly become lackluster. Maybe I missed the point, a change in tone and character that somehow came across (to me) as...well, ordinary. (I almost gave the book 4 stars because of this, but overall it's maybe a 4.8-star read.)<br />And the ending more than makes up for it, so don't let that stop you!<br />ODD THOMAS is a wild trip whose attractions show humanity at its ugliest and at its most beautiful. Don't miss this one!	2004-04-15

In heaven we will learn one life lesson from each of five people.<br />I found the story quite enjoyable. The characters held my interest, though to my taste they could've been more rounded out.<br />However, two things didn't sit right with me.<br />First, to a substantial degree, the story seems intended to ease our fears about death; to comfort us and give a happy version about what happens when we die.<br />Second, the lessons themselves are mostly disappointing. One lesson is outstanding! If only more people could truly understand this and make an effort to incorporate it into our lives. The other four, while there may be some truth in them, are little more than comforting beliefs.<br />Bottom line: If you can buy into the premise, this book may lift your spirits a bit, and there ain't nothin' wrong with that. But if you're looking for more substance, at best this book could be a starting point to get you thinking about your life. <br />In the end, it doesn't quite live up to its promise.	2004-03-22

It's a fascinating exploration about power in its many forms -- and the price that must be paid for wielding that power. We hear about power-in-action on a grand scale from one of the world's powerbrokers; we see it on a small scale between two men.<br />As I read the book, it raised more and more questions. Assumed roles are reversed. Situations are turned on their heads, as are morals and ethics. Apparently, for the world to work, in order for citizens of free countries to enjoy comparative wealth and freedom, those from less fortunate parts of the world must suffer. So, while we altruistically teach our children that it's wrong to lie, hurt people and steal, it turns out that lying, killing and stealing (not love) make our world go 'round.<br />At another time, in another country, &quot;The Man in My Basement&quot; probably would've been banned. To tyrannical Powers That Be, this is the most frightening of books: It makes you think.<br />Almost forgot. There's plenty of sex in it, too!	2004-03-22

The characters are likeable, funny and varied, it's a fast read, and there's loads of spooky stuff to look forward to.<br />After a few chapters, however, the seams began to show. It started with the baby talk. That alone had me climbing the walls!<br />It was downhill from there.<br />With rare exceptions, there's one voice, one sense of humor. Information is repeated with eye-rolling frequency. Way too many things go on that make no sense (witnesses being prepped for a hearing include only friends but no family -- not even the aunt with whom the person lives; a top psychiatrist teams up with a psych grad student, sight unseen; a cop discusses a murder case with two strangers; a doctor has time to hear Mark's life story, gives little medical information, yet Mark somehow knows what the doc should've told him but didn't). Characters know things they shouldn't know yet. The same phrases pop up over and over again. Many words are italicized, probably because the vocabulary's too limited and simple to express any depth of feeling. Regardless of subject matter, the tone remains light, airy and superficial. Cheerfulness doesn't mesh well with a story about psychotics and grisly murders.<br />REGINA'S SONG is an incredible story! What a shame it wasn't given a more worthy vehicle.	2004-01-29
US	52919398	R2BI1OWRDZ9A40	0446531510	765311385	Land of the Living (French, Nicci)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Suspense never lets up!	LAND OF THE LIVING grabbed me from the first sentence and wouldn't let go until the last.<br />Right off, we're inside the head of a woman who's been kidnapped. We're with her as she struggles to keep her sanity and as she comes to accept death as inevitable. The simpler her words, the more heartbreaking her ordeal. And the worst is yet to come: No one believes this really happened to Abbie. So, amnesia notwithstanding, she must recreate her 'lost days' as best she can, then retrace her steps back to her kidnapper.<br />Trying to fill in what she did during those forever-gone days was the part I loved best. It was like cell-thin layers of an onion being peeled away, one by one, ever so slowly. Excrutiating and tantalizing!<br />I found the dialogue and characters realistic. No cardboard cut-outs here. These are complex personalities dealing with extreme circumstances. They're smart and edgy, but make mistakes and bad decisions. With one glaring exception, there's no character who isn't both damaged and tough, confused and confident, intelligent and thick.<br />There's a refreshing lack of sentimentality. I think that's what freaked me most about this book -- how very real it all seemed. I know these people; I am these people.<br />Most thrillers slack off around the middle. This one does not. Nor did the ending disappoint.<br />LotL might not be to everyone's taste. Much of it is internal, what goes on in Abbie's mind. It's not action-packed. In no way is that a complaint! But if you like your thrillers riddled with violence and gore, you might be disappointed here.<br />Like the quote from THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY from which (I assume) LotL gets its title, the core of the story is the human condition. You don't have to look into it that deeply to enjoy it, but it's there if you're interested.<br />If Nicci French's other books are half as good as LAND OF THE LIVING, I'll be one happy gal!	2003-12-20

I ROARED when Miranda called her assistants in Manhattan so *they* could find her chauffeur...in Paris...a few yards away from Miranda!<br />So 'The Devil Wears Prada' isn't great literature.

After that, it's downhill. There's not much edge and little excitement. For the most part, THE SINNER is tepid and lackluster.<br />Even the requisite edgy female cop, Rizzoli, has her edginess dulled right from the beginning. Character development is fuzzy. Hints at sexual attraction or deepening friendship go nowhere. One whole chapter doesn't seem to have a point. Even the sexy scenes lack excitement. A horrible thing happens and there's plenty of gore, but, by the end, it doesn't add up to much.<br />The women do lots of soul-searching, but it's not profound. Rather than provide a breather, the love interests -- which took up way too much of the story for my taste -- weigh it down and only add to the ploddiness.	2003-09-06

Overall, the mood is upbeat, and you don't have to think too much. Nothing wrong with that.<br />However, if you're looking for something with more substance, this book might not be for you.<br />LAKE HOUSE is packed with cliches, quotes, paraphrases and such; catchy stuff you've been hearing for years. More troublesome was the lack of continuity. It seemed as though chunks of text were missing. It got worse near the end. An example that won't spoil the story: Frannie's in a bad situation; she's helpless.  Next thing you know, she's escaping with the rest of the gang. Wha' happened?! It was a quantum leap from one situation to another, with nothing to connect them. At the end, events moved much too quickly and abruptly; it was almost surreal. To be blunt, much about the book struck me as lazy and, well, sloppy.<br />Time was I counted James Patterson among my favorite authors. I hate saying it, but his latest is a major letdown.	2003-09-02

The problem is, for the past few months the scientists have been suffering from neurological disorders.  One of them, Dr. Fielding, succeeded in putting a temporary halt to the research (or so he thinks) until the cause of these disorders has been found.<br />The book opens dramatically.  It's six hours after Dr. Fielding's death, seemingly due to a stroke.  But his friend and colleague, Dr. David Tennant, is certain he was murdered.  Now David, accompanied by his psychiatrist, must run for his life.<br />What exactly has been going on in that lab?  What meaning, if any, is there to the dreams or visions David's been having during his narcoleptic attacks?  Why did Dr. Fielding send David that mysterious letter and what is the white granular substance in the envelope?  Is David's paranoia justified, or, as his psychiatrist believes, is he delusional?  As the answers to these questions are revealed, FoG is Greg Iles at his best!<br />Unfortunately, the story quickly sinks into a tepid cat-and-mouse game.  The characters are cardboard cutouts; the thriller aspects not so thrilling.  At the end of chapter 21 is an event that's never explained; we're left hanging, wondering what that was all about.  It's a small thing, but...well, sloppy.<br />So much for the first half of the book.  This seems to be a recurring problem for authors when they present an intriguing concept in the guise of a thriller (eg., THE DA VINCE CODE):  The ideas are fascinating, but it suffers as a thriller.<br />The second half is something else entirely!  The full potential of the megacomputer becomes terrifyingly clear.  David's visions been fathomed.  He knows now what must be done.  This is the edge-of-your-seat excitement we've come to expect from Mr. Iles.  It doesn't matter if you don't agree with the religious possibilities he presents (I don't think we're expected to.)  The ideas themselves are mind-blowing!  Motifs are an added treat.  For instance, keep an eye out for mention of candles and bubbles.<br />Though I could've done with less of the first half, THE FOOTPRINTS OF GOD is worth reading for its considerable intellectual rewards.	2003-08-22

The story-within-a-story is so fascinating, I've already added 4 related books to my Wish List. A great big *thank you* to Dan Brown for writing about one of the most ancient, intriguing, enigmatic mysteries!<br />As a thriller, however, it doesn't work well. Some of the plot twists struck me as unnecessary -- there for their own sake, not smoothly weaving themselves into the story. The premise for the murders never quite made sense to me. Maybe I missed something? And listen, if I can figure out the encoded clues long before the Harvard symbologist and the professional cryptologist do, they're way too easy.<br />With that out of the way, I loved this book!!

Another sees a thousand marvels.<br />As the shock of an earthquake wears off, a sort of soul-quake takes place. After all, if we can't rely on the ground under our feet to remain solid, what can we be certain of? Sometimes we KNOW that in the brain, but it takes an earthquake or terrorist attack for us to FEEL it in the gut -- for the knowing to be meaningful.<br />Something intangible but essential shakes loose in the people of Japan weeks after the Kobe earthquake. Like the rock mantle that once covered Kobe, neglected souls have liquefied. Now change is possible. For some, that means healing. For one, it means, not just losing, but unknowingly giving away his...soul(?). Another meets a heretofore hidden aspect of his Self. I guess it depends on what had been important in their lives and where they were headed before.<br />The stories are told gently, subtly and with respect. A writer's self-inflicted chains are broken and he finds his freedom. A dumpy, overly modest, milquetoast doormat of a man finds his true power. With the help of a guru/limo driver, a rock of hatred that even the soul-quake left intact is only now able to be recognized and dealt with.<br />I wouldn't presume to discuss Mr. Murakami's use of metaphor and allegory. I think each reader will find what s/he needs to find. (\\"When the student is ready....\\") That's one reason I'll be reading this book again soon: There's much to be found.<br />AFTER THE QUAKE, I suggest, is best read slowly and often, with soft and open awareness; it's to be contemplated upon.	2003-07-03

It digs below the surface even moreso than the author's other books.  You may end up spending more time thinking about the story than reading it.<br />Parts have a surreal or impressionistic (on the ferry taking them to Shutter Island) feel to them. I can't put my finger on it, but, to my mind, this aspect of the book is not as strong as it could've been; I sense (maybe incorrectly) that the author pulled back some. I like what he was going for and wanted more!<br />The last part of the story gets into heavy-duty paranoia, delusion, dangerous drug experimentation on unsuspecting victims, betrayal and all kinds of fun 1950s stuff.<br />Apparently, Mr. Lehane was inspired by Lord Byron's THE PRISONER OF CHILLON, of which a line is quoted.  Motifs and concepts in SHUTTER ISLAND are found in or perhaps mushroomed from Byron's poem:  Where do you draw the line between the imprisoned and the free; how much of freedom and imprisonment is a state of mind; how much do dreams blend into 'reality'; can the dead warn us of danger; is freedom any less important to animals (the rats! the rats!); can you be free to roam an island -- as, say, an orderly or nurse -- and still be imprisoned?<br />If you like to have every detail spelled out and every question clearly answered, this book might not be for you.  If you don't mind an author leaving his readers mysteries to ponder and puzzle over, grab it!<br />After you've read the book, re-read the first section; it'll take on a whole new meaning.  I believe it also gives a clue to the ending (which, by the way, is a total zinger!).	2003-07-01

A murderer disappears from a room with no exit; a janitor, questioned by two cops, doesn't exist; a security guard watches as a man signs his name, but a short time later the name's not there. And that's just the beginning! By the end, you won't know if you're coming or going.<br />Even Lincoln Rhyme, forensic scientist extraordinaire, is scratching his head over this one. \\"Too many sources to trace\\" is the evidence list's recurring theme. Rhyme's laser-sharp logic and intense focus on microscopic tangibles won't give him answers. He needs Sachs' intuitive abilities -- her 'wire' -- with people and surroundings. As they meld their respective strengths, Sachs comes to the fore as Rhyme's equal. Go Amelia!<br />The murderer, a master illusionist (dubbed The Conjurer), helps keep the twists and turns coming nonstop by using magicians' methods (which turn out to be not so different from those of a detective). But Rhyme is a fast learner. With the help of apprentice illusionist, Kara, he uses The Conjurer's own methods against him.<br />Then, just when everything seems about to be wrapped up, it all falls apart as The Conjurer executes his greatest performance. From there, it only gets better!<br />The story drew me in most powerfully when Sachs must interview the world's most reluctant witness: Rhyme. He struggles (though sometimes not) to recall a traumatic event that we read about not 20 pages before. Now, as Sachs patiently wheedles the details from Rhyme's memory, we experience the event as Rhyme did. Heavy-duty tension in that scene.<br />The concept of doubles struck me: The Conjurer as Rhyme's dark side personified; Kara as a young Amelia; The Conjurer and Kara's mentor, Thom and Jaynene, even Rhyme and Kara's 'mum' whose disabilities are reversed. Just a thought.<br />There was only one short section when I felt things went a bit overboard. Other than that, as crazily convoluted as the plot is, it always seemed plausible.<br />A mind-bending thriller that never lets up, peppered with intriguing facts about magic and magicians and a half teaspoonful of metaphysics, THE VANISHED MAN should appeal to a broad audience.<br />Do not.

But it's a one-day excursion as much as is Joyce's 'Ulysses.' That one day may just as well be a year, a lifetime or an era. Time is distorted; events are surreal; what seems coincidental, isn't. Don't expect everything to make sense in a rational, cognitive way.<br />A man begins his day with everything, and ends it with nothing. His ideas, beliefs and body slowly lose their integrity. The story is not a puzzle with clearly edged chunks of interlocking pieces, but a constantly spinning web whose strands are spun by employees, lovers, a wife and a barber. As the story evolves, the man devolves. There's dry wit and Monty Pythonesque lunacy. There's the microcosm reflected in the macrocosm and vice versa. Even when inane, the ideas expressed are fascinating.<br />COSMOPOLIS sometimes enlightened me, and other times confused me. After my mind digests it a bit, I'll read it again.	2003-05-29

This book has one thing most (as far as I can tell) classical mythology references don't have: PRONUNCIATION for every entry.

The characters come alive so vividly, I feel as though I've known them for years. There are no heroes here: Nereese is not the hottest cop in the bunch; for all his extreme generosity, Ray is not someone you'd want to emulate. Each person is a story and has stories, which add more depth to these already utterly believable people. It also connects them in a Zen-like way. I wasn't at all surprised to learn that the author is a screenwriter: Therein lies much of the book's strength.<br />So why not 5 stars? Two reasons. First, Mr. Price jumps back and forth between events in January and events in February. You get used to it, and even come to appreciate the effect, but it's kind of annoying at first. Also, though the story is tense and you can't wait to find out what happens next, it's slowed down by everyone telling their stories. Hmmm, above I said that was a good thing. Guess it's a two-edged sword, all the story-telling. Maybe there's a teeny bit *too* much character development (can't remember the last time I complained about that!). The suspense does suffer a bit.<br />Still, I recommend SAMARITAN, and plan to read more of Mr. Price's books.	2003-04-29
US	52919398	RG2WDSQVUE8JI	0679781382	999618850	Asylum	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Best book I've read in months	Why on earth would a beautiful, intelligent woman -- the wife of a psychiatrist no less -- risk everything for a feral affair with a psychopath? How could Stella's milquetoast husband be so blind to the needs of his passionate wife? Being a psychiatrist himself, why did he just stand by and watch Stella self-destruct?<br />The author treats each character with a distant sympathy and compassion. He applies to them his insight, understanding and wisdom. And we begin to understand why 'sane' people often act more bizarrely than the psychopath himself. After all, 'sane' is a relative, arbitrary term.<br />Though big pieces of the puzzle are missing or merely touched upon, slowly, slowly, Stella's actions begin to almost make sense. Even so, though you know nothing short of a nuclear attack could stop her, you think, No, you fool!, as Stella marches with fiery fervor straight to her doom.<br />There's lots of foreshadowing and metaphor that weave the story into a whole. The writing is fantastic: I found myself reading phrases and sentences over and over again. The style reminds me of film noire. The psychiatrist whose patient Stella was is the not-quite-unbiased narrator.<br />The first half and end of the book are suspenseful; you can't wait to see how it'll turn out. The middle third or so drags in places, but never for too long.<br />Some may be bored by the landscape of the mind that dominates the story. But if you're excited at the prospect of digging into minds of those who are dangerously unbalanced by overwhelming passion -- obsession beyond obsession -- this book is for you.<br />Again, Mr. McGrath's writing alone makes this book worthwhile. He totally drew me in.	2003-01-26

It has revealing background on both Alex and Milo. As in the previous book in the series, the tie-in between past and present gives the story extra depth. Milo's early career is especially intriguing, and, as always, Kellerman makes the characters come alive. But . . .<br />I found some descriptions unnecessarily long and tedious. I either slogged through or only skimmed too many sections. Every once in a while, a phrase struck me as cliche. So the story frequently dragged and lost momentum.<br />The parts that move are exciting, and throughout (yes, including the sloggy parts) you want to keep reading to find out the next development.<br />Though it could've used a few snips, THE MURDER BOOK's a stirring and provocative read.	2003-01-02

THE TREATMENT is emotionally powerful -- sometimes overwhelmingly so.  You *feel* and cry and can really *be* with the story.  The author seems to have taken her time writing this book and it shows.<br />The first thing that struck me was the dialogue. It's so natural, it's almost like reading transcripts of real life conversations. The author uses imagery and dialogue tie-ins to effective use.<br />The story starts out slowly -- a little too slowly for my taste. But past a certain point, the suspense picks up as though stung by a whip, and from there rarely slows down.<br />My main complaint is that there's too much going on. There's so much to keep track of -- so many story lines -- it's easy to forget important clues that need to be resolved. Also, beware that this is an almost unbearably ugly story involving pedophiles.<br />After having read too many thrillers whose endings are a big let-down, I'm happy to say that this ending doesn't disappoint. It's...well, I went through a gamut of emotions because of the way it ends.  Like I said, not an easy book to read.  But if you want a reading experience that hits you in the gut, go for it.	2002-11-24

The author is wrong about basic facts on which she bases her theories.  To wit:<br />Frodo does not, as the author claims, use the Ring \\"to test resistance to institutionalized power and the power of others within the community.\\"  He doesn't \\"use\\" the Ring at all; if anything, it uses him.  Gandalf's Elven ring does not save Frodo from the Nazgul at the Ford on the way to Rivendell; at that point in the story, we don't know that Gandalf has one of the Elven rings.  \\"Mordor\\" may mean\\"murder\\" in Anglo-Saxon, and that may have been in the back of Tolkien's mind; but \\"Mordor\\" mean \\"black-land\\" in Sindarin, and that's the meaning Tolkien wanted for the land.  Durin's Bane is not mithril or greed (though that is an issue), but the Balrog.<br />Dr. Chance does makes several interesting points, and for that reason I might, albeit with much hesitation, recommend this book to those who are familiar enough with LotR to avoid the pitfalls.	2002-11-20

The style is a little quirky -- just enough to make things interesting. The tie-ins and motifs work beautifully. The end sent chills down my spine. The characters are intense. There's enough background on them so you know what sort of people have been drawn into this horror.<br />The story unfolds slowly; it's not a fast read. But the characters and writing are so incredible, you don't want it to be a fast read! I've read many thriller/horror stories, but this one beats them all in terms of the sheer terror it instills in the reader. And it's much more than just a horror story. <br />Entralling and mesmerizing, I plan to read THRESHOLD again soon, as well as Ms. Kiernan's other books.	2002-11-14

The writing style's a mixture of art and craft; sometimes objects seem to be almost alive. The story is woven into a whole very nicely with thin strands of motifs and thicker strands tying together past and present. Gerritsen makes effective use of the senses: what the characters see, how things smell and feel to them. It adds another dimension to the reading. The medical and technical scenes are fascinating!<br />It's sort of a continuation of THE SURGEON, but you won't have to have read that book to enjoy this one. The salient points are covered.<br />A couple of reservations. The characters could've been fleshed out a bit more. At times they seemed more like 'types' than real people. I found the ending rather abrupt.<br />THE APPRENTICE is not only a gripping thriller, but one that will leave you with some haunting thoughts.	2002-10-25

The author even includes phases of the moon which, as any Hobbit knows, at times figure strongly in the story. Some may find it dry; however, the author doesn't pretend this book to be anything other than she claims it to be: maps. Clear, easy to follow, painstakingly detailed maps. Since I have trouble visualizing settings, this book has been a godsend!  The first time I read 'Return of the King' I was lost -- so very, very lost.  I couldn't figure out where anyone was!

The book is attractive, short, very clear and -- most importantly -- approachable. It includes a short history on Zen, a summary of its concepts, and possible interpretations and things to think about for each koan. The koan cards will help you expand your mind, and use it in ways other than cognitively.<br />And no peeking in the book until you've given each koan time to simmer in your mind :-)<br />Very highly recommended whether or not you're new to Zen.	2002-07-29

The psychological background is totally fascinating. I learned a lot about how the mentally ill are treated by the system, some background of schizophrenia, the difference between psychosis and schizophrenia and how they relate to the law, and so on. There's more, but I won't give away any surprises.<br />The dialogue, as always in Mr. Kellerman's books, rings true. Watch out for the main characters, though! The twists and turns keep coming right to the end of the climactic chapter.<br />A few minor complaints. I felt some secondary characters could've been developed more. This is just my taste, but I find the lengthy descriptions of buildings, landscapes, etc. a bit tedious. I had hoped for at least the beginning of a resolution to Milo's problems with homophobes at work. But you gotta save something for later in the series. I was taken aback to learn that, at the time OVER THE EDGE was written, gays were officially(?) considered deviants.<br />Lots of food for thought in this book. There are many ideas here that'll get your gray cells going.<br />If you have any interest in the workings of the human mind -- the sane and not-so-sane -- grab this book!	2002-07-22

All in all, most enjoyable! The wry humor is right on key; the characters are wonderfully drawn and empathetic; the wisdom sparse, but good old down-to-earth common sense; a fast read with great dialogue.<br />Mr. Coben incorporates amazing humanity into his characters -- even the 'bad guys.' As Myron learns about right and wrong, rarely is the delineation between the good guys and bad guys without a little fuzziness. They're all people doing the best they can given their particular circumstances. In the end, even Myron himself wonders if he's no longer one of the 'good guys.'<br />So why only 4.5 stars? The ending was a let-down. Also, there are references to past events that don't make much sense. Certainly, I don't expect the whole story. But often, just one more sentence would've satisfied me. Eh, minor complaint.<br />Will I read the rest of the Myron Bolitar series? You betcha!	2002-07-02

While the events in THE COBRA EVENT are fictional, they're based on fact. But never mind that! This is a top-notch thriller. The look into the mind of a bio-terrorist is staggering; there's little more terrifying than a psychotic who has strong logic and reasoning abilities.<br />I also highly recommend THE HOT ZONE, also by Mr. Preston. It's a factual account that reads like fiction.	2002-06-28

The story is clear enough, but the writing style is very bland. An attempt is made at Yoda's style of speaking, but without much success. The illustrations are not quite right. There's no excitement here, either in prose or pictures.<br />Though it's a book for kids (my guess, ages 8-12), it seems to me the small size would put off most children.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone except a Star Wars completist.	2002-06-07

In part, it's a seductive look into the meaning of identity. If you peel off the top layers of how we define ourselves -- the ones most prized by society -- what's left?<br />There's also room for rumination on loyalty and responsibility. It's not as obvious as it might seem!<br />A game of riddles keeps you guessing, waiting to see what the next development will be. So there's welcome interaction between the characters and the reader.<br />(Writing about this just now, I wonder if the title could refer to the reader in addition to the protagonist.)<br />The dialogue is very nicely done, and is a vast improvement over Mr. Katzenbach's earlier books. It seems a lot of research and thought went into how the characters express themselves.<br />And the ending's a real kicker!<br />I have a couple of minor reservations. Why didn't Ricky look up the fairy tale of Rumplestiltskin for more clues (even if only for the reader's sake)? Surely his tormentor put a lot of thought into his alias. Contemplation on the fairy tale character would seem in order.<br />Occasionally, the story goes a little over-the-top; at times, the events seem surreal. Didn't bother me, but it's worth mentioning.<br />Overall, THE ANALYST is a fascinating suspense story with plenty of food for philosophical thought (if you swing that way).	2002-05-01

If you love Tolkien, you'll get a lot of use out of this book. After a point, the sheer number of characters and places can become overwhelming -- especially when so many have several names.<br />'Guide' is a godsend, and is always right by my side every time I pick up Lord of the Rings. It's an invaluable companion book that covers everything from Arda to the Silmarillion. The descriptions are thorough; at times an entire histroy is given. Reference pages are noted. I had started taking notes, which was a real nuisance. This book makes that unnecessary.<br />In the trilogy, there are a few passages that hint at a great mystery. Impatient as I am, Mr. Foster's 'Guide' explains the pre-LotR history clearly without giving away *too* much.<br />Though it's a reference book, you can spend hours (no joke, I've done it!) going from one entry to another, as many are tied together in the story. For example, I looked up 'Palantir' and from there went to Saruman, Orthanc and maybe a dozen other entries.<br />What a fun book to get lost in!<br />I can't say enough about this book. It's absolutely fantastic, and if you love Tolkien's magnificent saga, you need the 'Guide'!	2002-03-10

Steve Turner gives the background story behind every Beatles song on all their officially released albums up to Abbey Road. Other books make the same claim, but this one's the best! To me, the most fascinating entries are about John's autobiographical songs, such as 'In My Life' and 'Strawberry Fields Forever.'<br />The story behind 'A Day In the Life' is riveting and is partly based on a personal tragedy for Paul.<br />Find out what John's inspiration was for 'Tomorrow Never Knows.' Does Dr. Robert really exist? 'She's Leaving Home' is based on a true story Paul had read about in a newspaper. Which was the first Beatles song not to be about love? Learn how much of an influence Dr. Timothy O'Leary was. Who's Ocean Child ('Julia')? Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is behind a few songs, but not always the way you might think! A song based on a conversation with Peter Fonda? You bet! What's the story of the sitar in 'Norwegian Wood,' and just who is the mysterious woman in whose bathtub John slept? I could go on and on!<br />The text is very well researched, and includes quotes from people who were involved with the Beatles.<br />The photos are excellent and add to the realness of the songs. See Eleanor Rigby's gravestone, Matt Busby (from 'Dig It')and the man who 'blew his mind out in a car.'<br />AHDW is thorough, accurate and FUN to read. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars!	2002-01-29

The opening scene is a study in mindfulness; almost hyperawareness. It's very internal, under the skin of the experience.<br />When her husband dies, Lauren tries to erase herself. To make herself go away? To get at what lies beneath the flesh and bones?<br />And that stranger . . . He's not completely 'there,' seems to exist in more than one time frame (in one of which time is not linear), and is in the process of creating himself by imitating things he's seen and heard in Lauren's past and future. Who is he? There's no answer; perhaps there's not meant to be one.<br />Time -- our perception of it versus nonlinear time -- is somehow at the core of this novella. But just when you feel you're getting close to a clue, whatever was in your mind slips away. There are no answers (or, for that matter, questions). There's just 'what is.'<br />When Rey's ex-wife and Lauren's friend enter the story, they barge in like uninvited guests. They don't belong. Lauren herself is different when around them. The external world is a brash intrusion into the not quite so material realm in which Lauren exists when in the home she and Rey rented. Where the stranger appears out of thin air, it seems.<br />A story that seduces and haunts.	2002-01-16

DANGERS OF THE CORE takes a section of the movie 'Phantom Menace' and, step by step, breaks down the action that flies by so quickly on the big screen. This makes it easy for children to follow. The excitement starts with the first sentence and never lets up!<br />The illustrations are expressive and dramatic; nicely done.<br />DANGERS teaches children to respect all living beings. Qui-Gon Jinn is the epitome of patience (especially with Jar Jar!), and remains calm, steady and in control even in the midst of danger. Excellent life lessons for children!<br />Another plus:  The story doesn't 'talk down' to children. It assumes an appropriate level of maturity and intelligence.<br />I'd take off half a star because Jar Jar's speech is impossible for some children to understand when reading the book on their own.<br />Nevertheless, all the children to whom I read DANGERS OF THE CORE just loved it! And with such a variety of characters and emotions, it's fun to read out loud, too.<br />Highly recommended for children as well as old fogeys who are young at heart!	2002-01-02

Yet you can't help but feel for those who, years later, are still haunted by their ordeal.

Later, he separates *himself* into two entities. One knows nothing of what the other does. In one sentence, he refers to himself both as 'I' and as 'Q__ P__.' Very convenient, as this allows him to completely detach from his actions. For example, he doesn't hit his victim with a crowbar; rather, the crowbar comes down and hits the victim. He does not act; the crowbar does.<br />His stories come out in jagged pieces: A few disembodied sentences here, more later; sometimes we never get the whole story. How can he be expected to think linearly, especially considering his odd relationship - or lack of one - with time. You see, his clock has no hands.<br />ZOMBIE is a book that can be read again and again. Read it superfically or delve into it to your heart's content. It's one of the most intriguing books I've ever read.	2001-12-17

Though it's never pushed, I read this tale as allegory. More on that in a sec.<br />The story grabbed me, but the writing didn't. It struck me as pedestrian. I was disappointed that more wasn't done with such a bone-chilling setting.<br />The characters are almost archetypes. Some blossom into themselves by being stretched beyond mundane boundaries. Most who don't bend -- who aren't enriched by these events -- are diminished.<br />Back to allegory. I saw parallels to Christ's life: Many characters' names started with `J'; there's a sort of crucifixion, death, 3 days in hell and resurrection; good vs. evil. There's even a character who may be said to play the part of Judas, and another that reminds me of Barabbas. A group of people act as Cerberus, guardian of the underworld. You could really dig into the story like that. But hey, that's just me.<br />THE MANHATTAN HUNT CLUB is good, but not great, entertainment. And if the reader brings something of hirself [sic] to it, the story and characters can be thought-provoking.	2001-11-22

One-dimensional gleefully exaggerated characters, weapons and technology out of second-rate sci-fi movies, and artificial dialogue liberally sprinkled with exclamation points. In a way it's a light read, but it's also heavy food for thought. Kinda creepy reading it now, so soon after the terrorist attacks.	2001-10-01

Now, Christopher Snow has charmed his way into my heart.  Though he's not a vampire, Chris, like L'Estat, can never step into the light of day.<br />This is Dean Koontz's second book featuring Christopher Snow (&quot;Fear Nothing&quot; was the first).  Chris suffers from a genetic disorder that forces him to avoid all ultraviolet light.  Here's a man who's never seen a sunny -- or any other -- day.  Yet every one of his DNA-damaged cells is filled to the brim with love.  Imagine the incongruity of a surfer who will never see sunlight.<br />Chris' unremitting self-honesty, humor, self-deprecating wit and spirituality can come only from one whose life has been turned upside-down by extreme circumstances beyond his control.  According to medical wisdom, Chris should have died years ago.  Death haunted him at the tender age of 9.  But rather than run from his fears and demons, Chris stares them in the eye -- faces them head-on -- until they hold no mystery for him.  His is not a blind optimism, but one that is the rational result of wisdom, thought-fullness and reason.<br />Christopher Snow may never spend a nanosecond in outer light.  But he is imbued, body, mind and soul, with an inner light few of us will ever attain.<br />Almost forgot.  The book is very good.  But in this instance, for me, all else is secondary to the characters.	2001-04-12

Filled with aphorisms, tried-and-true maxims and humor -- especially humor! -- there's something for everyone, whether or not alcoholism has invaded your life or that of a loved one. They may be short, but it can take a lifetime to fully probe and put into practice the wisdom of some of these sayings. Best of all, it can be enjoyed on many levels. Pick it up for a minute or spend an hour delving into its humor and wisdom; breeze through it or ponder a personally meaningful truism; or find those that will have you nodding with a knowing smile.	2001-02-27

Self-help books are supposed to be uplifting. Mr. Pelzer's deeply disturbing recollections of his childhood are repeated and expanded upon throughout the book, and negate any positive message. I felt as though I were eavesdropping in on a therapy session. Open to any page at random and it's peppered with the word &quot;I.&quot; It gives the impression that the self-help messages were added in between entries of an already-existing private journal.<br />The maxims themselves are good, though nothing we haven't heard dozens of times. Many of the examples used to illustrate these ideas are so extreme, few can relate to them. And if you can relate -- if you've been in a concentration camp or were victimized by a horrific childhood -- either you don't need this book or you need more help than any book can provide.<br />Mr. Pelzer's self-congratulatory manner is another turnoff. Some passages struck me as insincere. With all due respect to Mr. Pelzer and his ability to overcome an unimaginably abusive childhood, self-help books shouldn't leave you wow-ing the author's accomplishments.<br />If you've read self-help books, you won't find anything new here. If you're new to the genre, it might turn you off to them.<br />While writing this book may have been cathartic for Mr. Pelzer, it does little for the reader's frame of mind.	2001-02-14
US	52919398	R2XEUT4E9MUAMH	1582340811	352322588	The Toy Collector	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Deceptively simple . . .	&quot;The Toy Collector&quot; is a great read that can be enjoyed on various levels.  I was very impressed by author James Gunn's insight, compassion, humor and use of dialogue.  With memorabilia such a huge business, it's food for thought as well.<br />Jim is young child with a vivid imagination and a remarkably deep sense of responsibility for his brother and friends.  In the next chapter, we meet Jim years later -- an emotionally empty, moral-less man.  What caused such a drastic change?  The reader finds out much later in the story, which skillfully alternates between Jim as a child and Jim as an adult.<br />Something that was never supposed to happen happens.  In one cataclysmic flash, Jim's soul is shattered into a million pieces.  Something essential has been lost.  Jim thinks he can undo the damage and avoid being hurt again by recreating his childhood -- specifically, by replacing the toys he had as a child.<br />As he ghost-walks through life, Jim refuses to face the responsibilities of adulthood.  When his girlfriend makes a sweet gesture, Jim freaks out; the pain is so violent, Jim is convinced he's about to die.  Yet his true pain is not a physical one.  Its cause is the realization that emotional ties are being created, and with them responsibility for another person.  But he can't handle it -- not again.  While toy dinosaurs can be created, scrunched and created again indefinitely, the human heart is not always so malleable.  Only after an act of destruction, and when a friend takes responsibility for Jim, is there redemption.  A fervent sense of responsibility led to Jim's downfall, and the gift of responsibility is his salvation.	2000-10-09
