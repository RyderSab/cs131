What a great tale that uses the old Sleeping Beauty story and weaves it into reality.  Like the Shrek cartoon, the knight that comes to rescue the princess is not what everyone expected.  In this story the Knight is Ivan, a modern scholar who is already engaged to be married.  He finds the sleeping princess in a clearing in the woods and must battle past a bear to awaken the princess with a kiss. <br /> <br />In order to save both of their lives to save themselves from the \\"stunned\\" bear, he has to promise to marry her.  Not realizing what that means he follows the princess and finds himself transported back in time one thousand years to the princess' real time.  It is a time where men battle by the sword and there is an evil witch that is after the throne which was to be inherited by the princess and her \\"husband.\\" <br /> <br />Ivan realizes that what he never took too seriously has just become real and he has to figure a way to stay alive and find his way back to his own time.  This is difficult because only the princess can bring him back and she is loathe to do that because it would give her kingdom to the evil witch. <br /> <br />Card is an multi-talented writer who has spun a superb tale that I could not put down until I read every last page!	2005-10-12

Card spins another good ghost tale (see Treasure Box) about Dan, a man with a troubled past (he blames himself for the death of his daughter) who has given up on relationships and now makes a living buying old rundown houses and restoring them. <br /> <br />Dan comes across the old Bellamy house which was built a century earlier by a man who wanted to give the perfect house to his wife.  The couple were big society people and after they died, the house fell into the hands of various disreputable individuals and became a speakeasy and a brothel until ending up as an apartment house for college students. <br /> <br />The house has been deserted for about 10 years and the closest neighbors are two \\"wierd\\" old women who live in what was once the Bellamy house's carriage house. <br /> <br />Dan buys the house and finds that it is not as abandoned as he thought.  Additionally, the wierd neighbors prefer that he destroy the house rather than fix it up.  As the book progresses we see that the house in not just an inanimate object but possibly a living thing. <br /> <br />During the book Dan has to wrestle with his past and becomes the \\"crying-post\\" for his troubled real estate agent as well as his houseguest. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book and held back from giving it 5 stars only because I thought that Dan missed too many obvious clues about the \\"secret\\" of his houseguest and that I would have liked to have learned more about the house in its glory days. <br /> <br />	2005-09-29

This book is like a long short story that centers around Danny and a period that he is at Yale.  He and his friends are preparing for a big party.  The book goes on to follow Danny as he tries to start a relationship with Polly (who is sometimes on sometimes off in her relationship with one of her professors) while remembering about a local girl back home named Cindy who he kind of left in the lurch after they finally went all the way.   <br /> <br />Just before Danny is ready to go home for spring break and work on his father's mobile lunchmobile, Cindy arrives at the school with a big surprise.  This changes Danny's view on things and makes him numb to the point that he even doesn't care when some toughs try to hone in on his father's lunch route and threaten him. <br /> <br />Danny goes back to school after the break and after resolving his issues with Cindy to attend the big bash that his friend Matt was planning at the beginning of the book. <br /> <br />This book like one of his later works, Little Children, shows Perrota's talent for creating intriguing characters in such short novels.  This book like the other seems to end too prematurely and definately screams out for a sequel! <br /> <br />Perrota is a super talented writer and I would love to seem him develop a much larger complete novel than leave the audience hanging at the end of another short one.	2005-09-21

I really enjoyed this possible future where a membrane envelops the Earth causing a condition called the \\"spin\\" where time on Earth is passing slowly while the rest of the universe is aging at super fast speed.  The characters face most of the story worrying that it will mean the end of days in about 50 years because the sun will age so fast that it go nova about that time. <br /> <br />Three young people, Tyler, Jason and Diane are caught up with the whole thing and the book focuses on the tight bonds between the three as they grow and become intregal parts of the Earth's efforts to find a solution.  Meanwhile Jason & Diane's authoritative father, E.D., looms over them trying to control everything that they do. <br /> <br />I didn't quite give the book 5 stars because it is told in a flashback type of mode which I really was not crazy with.  The flashback portion was extremely interesting, where what was supposed to be happening in the present day was difficult to understand (until the very end) and many times boring.	2005-09-12

One is called the Changeling who changes into different people, animals or things.   The other is the Cameleon who can change into any person.  The Cameleon is a predator who enjoys killing anyone who gets in his way.  Both of these creatures have blended into human lives and neither can be killed. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, an artifact has been discovered on the island of Samoa that both these creatures are drawn to.  The object is heavier than any known material and appears to be industructable.  Both creatures are drawn to the object, the Changling to learn about it since it senses that the object has something to do with its own existance.  The Cameleon feels that other creatures like itself may be drawn to the object and he wants to eliminate them as possible competition. <br /> <br />The story of the Changling is told in a fascinating manner through decades where he is a man then a shark then a man again, then sometimes a woman or an object. <br /> <br />The story builds to a showdown between the two creatures, the object and the scientists who are studying it.  My only problem with the book is that I felt the author rushed the ending as a matter of fact I had 4 pages left and was thinking there will be a sequel but there was a kind of ending that made me feel that the author could have drawn it out more.	2005-08-20
US	50909980	R2UZ7M1HUVMHH6	0446576972	670656489	Dance of Death	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Excellent!	I really enjoyed this book as well as most of the prior works of the authors.  This book ties together all the previous works involving Special Agent Pendergast by bringing together all the characters that survived those stories.  When we last saw Pendergast he was walled up and running out of oxygen.  The authors gave clues at the end of the book that he got out as they describe digging and a possible break in the wall. <br /> <br />In Dance of Death, Pendergast is presumed dead and policeman Vincent D'Agosta has gone back to live with his girfriend, police captain Hayward.  In the meantime a couple of mysterious deaths occur involving a college professor who gets poisoned by a rare spider venom and another man who is force to jump out of a window only to be hanged by a noose around his neck. <br /> <br />As each murder occurs the one thing is clear, all the victims were friends of Pendergast.  Additionally, there is DNA and other evidence to link Pendergast to the crime. <br /> <br />Pendergast, having escaped his prison and in hiding (to avoid capture by the police) is trying to capture the killer before all his friends are wiped out.  Pendergast is the only one who konws the killer is his evil brother Diogenes who had faked his own death 20 years earlier.  Therefore, nobody believes it is anyone but Pendergast who is commiting the murders. <br /> <br />With tons tension throughout the book, this is probably one of the authors' best books.  This is the second book where the authors mention someone reading The Ice Limit III so you wonder if there will ever be a follow-up to that book.  Though the Ice Limit did not involve Pendergast there is a scene in Dance of Death in which Pendergast and D'Agosta are at a scientific place that guarentees success (like the company in The Ice Limit) and there is a picture on the wall of an oil tanker with a blond haired woman captain (like The Ice Limit).	2005-08-12

Sawyer puts a little bit of everything into this book from robotics, to brain studies, to psychology to philosophy with a little bit of high drama and excellent courtroom cross-examination.  He studies the question \\"what makes a person\\"? and takes it way beyond what Asimov presented in the Millenium Man story. <br /> <br />Jake Sullivan, a man with an illness that will eventually kill him decides to opt for a process called Mindscan where a copy of his mind will be uploaded to a robot brain and will live on as Jake on Earth why Jake goes to a pleasant retirement home on the moon to live out his remaining days.  The \\"new\\" Jake faces all kinds of rejections from the people he knew, even his dog.  He experiences new sensations like being able to see colors for the first time (he was color blind) and having too much idle time on his hands with no time to fill it since his biological self used it for sleeping, eating and other biological processes that Jake no longer needs to do. <br /> <br />He meets and bonds with Karen, another mindscan who was 85 but has chosen a robot body that is about 30 while Jake was in his early 40's.  The differences in their eras is what makes them so attractive to each other and they find that they have plenty to talk to each other even during \\"idle\\" time. <br /> <br />When Karen's biological self dies, her son begins a court battle to claim his inheritance, claiming that the mindscan version of Karen has no rights because she is not really Karen.  The court tension is amazing and great philosophical arguments are presented in a well scripted matter. <br /> <br />To add another problem, Jake's biological self finds a cure for his ailment and then wants to regain his former life from his mindscanned version. <br /> <br />Sawyer has outdone himself this time convincing me he is the best of the current Scifi writers out there today!	2005-08-05

Card has a special flair for bringing lesser known bible tales to life in a compelling manner.  This is one of those tales.  The grandson of Abraham & Sarah (Jacob) travels to a relative's camp (Laban) to find a bride.  He is promised by Laban that if he works for seven years, that he can marry Laban's youngest daughter Rachel.  Jacob agrees and then needs somebody to copy the holy books of Abraham that he carries. <br /> <br />Jacob is assigned Bilhah, the handmaiden of Laban's older daughter Leah.  Bilhah is a young woman who was robbed of her inherited dowery by an unscrupulous cousin who was indentured to Laban.  With no place to go and no money, she ended up living in Laban's camp.  Leah has difficulty with her sight (probably just severly near-sighted) which makes it difficult for her father to find a husband for her.  Also, she has a very \\"bitter\\" personality because of this which does not help matters. <br /> <br />Leah becomes interested in Jacob's holy books and joins Bilhah and Jacob in reading and discussing the holy books.  Little by little the words of the books creep in to Leah's soul making her a less bitter.  With Leah's love of the books, it becomes obvious that she has more in common with Jacob than Leah, who spends her days attending the herds. <br /> <br />To say more, would spoil the ending for those not familiar with it.  I really enjoyed this tale and look forward to the next book in the series.	2005-07-28

Though he does a heck of a lot worse to the guest than Russell Crowe recently did to a hotel clerk, nothing happens to him. <br /> <br />I found him a very difficult \\"hero\\" to root for and really lost interest in this book about halfway through.

Unfortunately this is not one of them.  The writer must have seen the \\"Mary\\" episode of the old Star Trek where a disease wipes out anyone over 12 years old to come up with the idea for this book.  Where in that episode, the kids had to cope with the idea that they would get the disease when they got older, that idea is never brought about here. <br /> <br />I am in total agreement with the reviewer who said the writing is poor.  It is beyond poor.  The writer left out a whole lot of things that would happen if most of the population were wiped out by disease.  Firstly, there would be a problem of all the unburied bodies everywhere.  Secondly, plumbing and other things would stop working pretty fast if things were not kept running. <br /> <br />Then there would be a problem with packs of stray dogs that do not have food.  They might be more dangerous than the gangs of kids that throw a few punches to take away food from other kids. <br /> <br />I also think it is quite dumb that only Lisa can figure out where to look for food and supplies and nobody else can.  It's like all the other kids never learned how to read. <br /> <br />I feel that the writer insulted the intelligence of the reader and just decided because they were writing teen fiction that they could pretend that the reader is totally ignorant.	2005-07-06

Then the book fast forwards to present day Germany. <br /> <br />A religious ceremony becomes a blood-bath when a bunch of armed commandos dressed as monks attack (monks seem to be popular bad guys in all of Rollins books) slaughtering the participants and stealing some bones thought to be those of the Magi. <br /> <br />A government team is put together by Painter Crowe in Maryland to investigate.  As soon as they get to the scene they are set on by the bad guys (I guess they do return to the scene of the crime).  What follows are chases through some historical landmarks and puzzles to be solved  <br /> <br />This book is the sequel to Sandstorm which was an excellent book from start to finish.  Map of Bones lacks a lot of key elements present in the other book.  Firstly there is virtually no character development.  It seems the government team is just thrown together in the beginning of the book and we know very little about anybody's past. <br /> <br />The bad guys seem to be ubiquitious throughout the book but very inept at killing any of the government team.  Also, the author tries to capitalize on the treasure hunt through religious artifacts and sites that was prevelent in The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons.  However, the author fails to recreate the tension of those books plus he has the government team solve each puzzle too easy. <br /> <br />I had a real hard time finishing this book and I only gave it three stars because of some of the historical content that had me searching the Internet for more information.	2005-06-28

Something causes the insect population of the world to virtually disappear.  This causes a chain reaction whereby other species that were dependent on those insects start to die off and other species that were kept in check by those insects start to attack humans.  Crops start to fail, et al.  A group of scientists are studying the problem and trying to come up with ways to repopulate the insects (mostly through cloning) before man is wiped out from the face of the Earth. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the story itself is not so exciting.  This was one of the most boring end-of-the-world stories I have ever read.  The characters seem to be too one dimensional and as uninteresting as they could possibly be.  As such I found myself skipping over a lot of sections so I could just get to the ending and move on (the only thing that held me was to find out how man ultimately righted the world or disappeared).	2005-06-17

I was a little disappointed with this thriller after seeing all the great reviews.  It seemed to move real slow and had its share of bumbling bad guys that can't seem to do anything to the two main characters even though they are fairly accessible.  The sadistic bad guys seemed to not always be sadistic.<br /><br />A Japanese businessman gets set up and commits a murder to prevent damaging photos from being put in the press.  Then we have Dan, an executive from a logging company who is giving a large sum of money to a lawyer (Maria) who is an environmentalist against Dan's company.  When the money is handed off it is stolen by Corey, who is an environmentalist with a lot of grudges against the world for the abuse she took from her uncle.<br /><br />As unlikely a pair that there is, Dan and Maria are thrown together on the trail of the stolen money.  The chase leads them to somehow get into the company grounds of the Japanese businessman (mentioned above)and to discover that the company is working on something ilicit involving bats.  They are caught tresspassing on the grounds yet the bad guys leave them alone in a room for which they are able to pass around to other parts of the grounds and find evidence about the ilicit doings the company is involved in.<br /><br />The whole time Dan and Maria seem to be together whether they have a big fight or are friendly.  Their relationship is as inplausible as the whole goings on of the book.<br /><br />I kept waiting for more action in this book but everything that happens seems to drag out.  I understand that the author has a couple of better thrillers on the market so I will withhold judgement on his writing until I have read those other books.	2005-06-06

With interesting ideas about the \\"Egyptian\\" Moses and his \\"Egyptian\\" mother who literally became both his mother and father (this is explained in the story) and her struggle to keep the Pharoahship from the evil Tuthmose and his equally evil family. <br /> <br />Card provides a vivid narration of what happened to Moses during the time he was in exile in the desert and when he obtained his real education.  We are presented with an \\"unsure\\" and self-doubting Moses that relies on the Lord to allow him to do the right thing and say the right things.   We have a compassionate Moses who wants to see Pharoah punished but grieves for the innocent Egyptians that he causes ruin and death to. <br /> <br />This is a much deeper and more realistic telling of the tale than what Cecil B. DeMille portrayed in his Ten Commandments film.  There is no glitz and glitter here, just the magnificient tale is presented with a lot of lessons to be learned and good advice for anyone to lead a better life.   <br /> <br />A must read!	2005-05-20

Having never attending a boarding school or out of town college, I was always jealous of those who did.  This book gives me a picture of some of the things I missed out on.  In this case however, it is presented from the eyes of someone who experienced the life but as someone who was considered an outcast (but not really a nerd). <br /> <br />Lee, comes from a middle class family in Indiana.  Having received a scholorship to attend the prestigious boarding school Ault, she is thrust into a campus life with a lot of kids from very affluent families.  Lee never seems to \\"appreciate\\" herself and feels inferior to the other students throughout her time at school.  Though she have very strong emotional feelings she keeps them bottled up because she cosniders herself a \\"loser\\" and is constantly in fear of failure and never takes any risks for pleasure. <br /> <br />Lee is very good at judging the other people around her but never realizes that the real short-comings in herself are her own self imposed boundaries.  At various times she has strong crushes on other students, the first being with Gates (a female) and then Cross (a boy).  She never gives any of her crushes even the slightest hint how she feel even though she watches them from the fringes with a very strong attraction but not enough imagination for even a fantasy.  You keep reading along and wish you could make yourself appear into the story and guide Lee along on the right path to getting what she really wants. <br /> <br />The book rarely covers anything in the classroom and most of the story takes place over the four years of high school in the student dorms.  I thank the author for giving me a glimpse of what I seemed to miss out on.	2005-05-04

The others could be easily enjoyed by all where this book definately is for a fairly young audience.    It starts out quite intriguing where Kira, a teen is hypnotized by her friend and has wierd memories that seem like they are from another person.  When she asks her mother about the memories, her mother appears very disturbed and doesn't give Kira a satifactory answer.  Then Kira's mother mysteriously disappears.      From there on the book turns into a fairly juvenile tale along the lines of Agent Cody Banks with a secret town, government plotting and dopey criminals.  As one who did enjoy Agent Cody Banks I liked the book but was disappointed with the style because I was expecting something a little more believable like Turnabout.	2005-04-29

This book is a perfect example of a compelling tale that has universal appeal written in Haddix's own style that draws you in until you realize that you have finished the book before you can even put it down! <br /> <br />A group of senior citizens in a nursing home are presented the chance to participate in an experiment that may extend their life.  Most of them, not knowing what they are signing agree to participate.  What they don't know that the experiment is to inject them with the fountain of \\"un-aging,\\" meaning that as each year passes they will physically be one year old less. <br /> <br />Sounds good?  However, like the tale of the Monkey's Paw there is a catch.  For each year the person de-ages, they lose one year of their memories from the time before they began the experiment.  Meaning that new memories are overwriting old memories like a video tape machine does.  On top of that there is no guarantee that the process can be stopped, therefore it is possible that subjects will de-age until they become a fetus and then nothing. <br /> <br />The book centers around two of the subjects who have reached the age that they are no longer adults and need someone to care for them.  On top of that they feel they no longer can trust the agency that created the secret experiment and has sheltered them all the years that they were getting younger. <br /> <br />I totally enjoyed the book though I felt that there were a few loose ends left in the end.  However, the author may be waiting to see if there is a demand for a sequel.  I for one hope so.	2005-04-27

This one is different then some of the other books he appears in since this is the only one that doesn't take place in New York (actually a couple of brief scenes at the mansion from The Cabinet of Curiousities do occur.  But these seem to be a prelude to a future book as the man cataloging the artifacts seems to be being watched) or have any mention of the Museum of Natural History.<br /><br />In this one Pentergast recruits a misfit teen to drive him around and take notes for him.  It doesn't take long for Pentergast to deduce that the killer resides locally so he needs to know everything about the town and its populace.<br /><br />Pentergast seems to butt heads with the local sheriff, who is a good policeman himself with good instincts and he feels that Pendergast is a hinderance to his investigation.<br /><br />What makes this book great is the small town personalities that the authors have developed, especially the town's newspaper reporter/editor who has never covered a \\"real\\" news story in his entire life and is now cranking out the headlines as more information comes forward about the killings.  Also, there is a super tense sequence that takes place in the caverns, where the killer is picking off people one by one that was one of the most frightening piece I writing I have ever read!<br /><br />The book lets us learn a little bit about Pentergast's professional life where we learn that he was a very successful special forces commando as well as FBI agent.	2005-04-25

Langdon is whisked out of bed and transported around the world to Switzerland to CERN, which is the top scientific research facility in the world. A scientist has been murdered and a sample of one of his creations has been stolen. This sample is as powerful as a nuclear powered device and apparently it is in the hands of an ancient cult of which Langdon is an expert. This is why he was selected to help CERN. <br />With the help of the murdered scientist's daughter, Vittoria Vetra, Langdon chases the sample to the Vatican. Apparently, the cult wants to destroy the Vatican and the Catholic Church during the time when the Cardinals are selecting a new Pope. Clues to where the cult will strike are contained in the ancient archives of the Vatican. With these clues, Langdon and Vittoria use their problem solving skills to track an assassin around Rome trying to catch him before time runs out for the Church. <br /> <br />The book draws you in from the start and the tension is intense as Langdon and Vittoria reach several seemingly dead ends and make several miraculous escapes. It is a very fast read and Brown seems to have an incredible depth of knowledge regarding many secret places within Vatican City. My only problem with the book is that when the ultimate villain (codenamed Janus) is finally revealed, he doesn't seem plausible as the one that could have orchestrated all that occurred. <br /> <br />	2005-04-18

Rollins introduces several other characters including Safia's ex-boyfriend Omaha, who is a reckless adventurer somewhat like Indiana Jones.  In fact Safia's best friend insists on calling him Indiana.  Not to give anything away but there is also an interesting group of women who have strong ties to ancient times that Rollins does a good job in portraying. <br /> <br />Rollins does a good job of explaining the legends behind Ubar but along the way there are many parts of the book that seem to have you shaking your head.  Also, the corrupt Cassandra is full of contradictions and you realize that Rollins had to include this to ensure that the book's heroes don't get killed too soon into the book. <br /> <br />I have read several of Rollins works (Amazonia, Excavation, Ice Hunt) and while this book has some good parts it is not even close in quality to those other books and therefore I only give this book slightly more than 3 1/2 stars.	2005-04-14

Card does an excellent job and incredible research, expanding on a tale that has limited details in the bible and bringing it to life in great depth.  My only complaint is that it ends too soon with Abraham leaving with Isaac and a hint that this is because G-d has asked Abraham for the ultimate sacrifice.  Obviously, because it is Sarah's story so that is why Card chose not to continue.   <br /> <br />Card provides excellent commentary at the end discussing what is known from the Bible, what the different interpretations are, historical evidence, and his reasoning for deciding how the characters should be related.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to more in the series. <br />	2005-04-01

Special Agent Pendergast has evolved to be Preston & Child's focal point.  In each of their novels they seem to release a little more information about him. <br /> <br />In this book he has evolved to be the equal of Sherlock Holmes with a little bit of Houdini thrown in.  He now has a police sidekick (Officer D'Agosta) just like Holmes had his Doctor Watson and the book sets up for a showdown with Pendergast's evil older brother (a la Mycroft Holmes).  <br /> <br />The book seems to go in several directions from devil conjurings to supernatural-like deaths to terrorists to valuable antiquities.  Through it all, the authors seem to hit their stride with Pendergast and D'Agosta who make a nice complementary team.  I know the authors are busy with a lot of solo projects these days but I hope they follow-through with the continuation that this book promises. <br />	2005-03-21

Note: Possible Spoiler	This is generally a good book about a Mormon family that moves to Lousianna to a community where everybody seems to be an enemy to them.  The husband is a computer programmer who has a controlling boss and works for a company that wants to own him like a slave.  He and his wife are stuck because they are up to their neck in debt and his wife is pregnant so he can't afford to lose the job. <br /> <br />Meanwhile their eldest son (Stevie)is being treated harshly by his second grade teacher and has withdrawn into a quiet shell of himself.  When the boy's father (Step) goes to talk to the teacher he makes her quit and she later becomes another of the famiy's enemies, but his son seems to remain in a funk. <br /> <br />His son starts playing with imaginary friends and then seems to play a computer game that shouldn't exist.  Addiitionally, the family's home seems to be periodically invaded by swarms of insects and they receive a threatening record in an unmarked envelope.  The threatening record could be from any number of wacky people in the town from Stevie's crazy school teacher, a possible child molester that works with Step, a wacky member of their Mormon church, a boy who worked in the church with Step that seems to have mental issues, Step's vindictive boss, or maybe the wierd handyman that works at the house. <br /> <br />The story moves along with wierd things happening and you keep expecting an explosion of evil or battle to occur.  Actually nothing really happens until the last 10 pages of the book and though the story of Step's family is gripping, I withheld giving the book 5 stars for this reason.	2005-03-10

It is hard to discuss it without creating many spoilers except it deals with a group of criminals that kind of \\"trap\\" a young man plagued by gambling debts into helping them steal a deadly virus.  Throughout the story a big snowstorm slows down any investigation as well as the criminals' getaway.   <br /> <br />I had several problems with the story that kept me from giving it higher marks.  Being in the computer security field, I find it highly implausable how the security controls are bypassed so easily to get into the lab where the virus is stored.  Also, right from the start the main character (Tony Gallo) is headed to be the love of her boss who is about 25 years her senior.  Their relationship made me very uncomfortable. <br /> <br />The book does have a lot of tension and most of the times the only thing protecting the people involved is the bumbling of the criminals.  There are some decent supporting characters and it is interesting to see how different police work is in rural Scotland from what we are used to.	2005-02-27

This is about the eighth book I have read by Messrs Preston & Child and it was the best of the bunch!  This book grabbed me from the start and was very difficult to put down.  Once again we are back at the New York Museum of Natural History with Special Agent Pendergast and reporter Smithback from Relic and Reliquary and Nora from Thunderhead as the main characters. <br /> <br />The book takes place not that long after the end of Thunderhead.  Nora has relocated to New York and has taken a job doing research for the museum.  She gets a sudden visit from Special Agent Pendergast who requests that she accompany him to a lower Manhattan site where there is an excavation going on for putting up a building.  Reluctantly, she accompanies him and they learn that a chamber was unearthed that has a lot of skeletons; victims of a 19th century serial killer.   The chamber is under the site that once had a cabinet of curiosities which was another name for a museum (however, it was one that charged a fee kind of like the Ripley's Believe it or not museums). <br /> <br />The police and the construction company want the chamber cleared immediately so they can continue construction on the site.  Pendergast wants Nora to use her archeological expertise to examine the remains and let him know anything that she can about them.  This opens up a whole can of worms because the construction company fears that the site will be declared an historical landmark and they will be prevented from building.   They put pressure on the mayor and the museum to have Pendergast and Nora stopped. <br /> <br />Nora tells all this to Smithback (now her boyfriend) who writes an article in the Times describing the site and suggesting a cover-up.  Almost immediately victims are killed in the same manner as the victims from the site and police blame Smithback for his article saying that he created a copycat killer. <br /> <br />The book continues and we find that the past has a great deal to do with what is happening in the present and understanding the past is the only way to save more victims going forward.   <br /> <br />With this book we finally get a look into Pendergast's personal life and his childhood.  I had found him annoying in the prior books and almost bumbling.  In this book we appreciate his intellect and find him to be a real hero-type. <br /> <br />The authors also seem to borrow some tricks used by Jack Finney in his From Time to Time books. <br />	2005-02-15

This is kind of a \\"yuppie\\" version of a Richard Russo novel.  The story has various characters that face many of the same temptations as most people do and seem to act on them without thought to the consequences to their lives. <br /> <br />The two main characters are Todd, a \\"thirtyish\\" father who never stopped being a teenage football hero that all the girls were crazy about in high school.  Todd got married to one of the popular girls (Kathy) from college, who become the typical working mother who kept her good looks.  Todd is supposed to be using the summer days to study for the bar exam but he prefers to hang out in front of skateboarders and envy them and he later gets roped into playing a dangerous game of football in a league with some cops. <br /> <br />Then there is Sarah, who is like a lost teenager, unsure about her sexuality, who married an older man just to try to bring some sanity to her life.  She is a good mother but still looking for meaning in her life.  Her husband loves to use the Internet chat sites and gets involved with some pornographic sites.  One day Sarah catches him doing something \\"disgusting\\" and loses whatever feeling she may have had for him. <br /> <br />Sarah, hangs out at the playground with her young daughter trying to \\"fit in\\" with the other mothers there but she finds their conversations empty and finds the women annoying, especially Mary Ann, a control freak that already has her four year old on a path to Harvard and \\"allows\\" her husband to make love to her only on Tuesdays. <br /> <br />The mothers have one thing in common is that they moon over Todd, who comes to the park everyday with his son.  Sarah gets fed up with all their daydreaming about Todd and tells them so.  They kind of dare her to go up to him and talk to him.  Sarah does them one better and not only goes up to Todd and gets him to kiss her right there in front of the mothers.  That kiss sets off sparks, because it not only makes Sarah a pariah to the mothers, but something happens between her and Todd that will make their worlds topsy-turvy. <br /> <br />While the Todd/Sarah love saga unfolds, there is a sub-plot about a paroled child molester who is living in their neighborhood and is being hounded by one of Todd's cop friends.  The cop's obsession seems to ruin his life. <br /> <br />The book to me is a kind of what if.  Many of us fantasize about some of the things that the characters in the book act upon, but would never have the guts to upset our own \\"comfortable\\" lives to act on our desires. <br /> <br />The only downside to the book is that while several of the books characters finally understand themselves at the end, the book seems to end abruptly and I just wish that it could have continued.  It would have been nice if the author gave you a \\"what happened\\" to the characters at the end, kind of like several movies do. <br />	2005-02-08

This book has a lot of interesting information about archeology and the tribes that inhabited the New Mexico (I'm assuming that is where they were) area hundreds of years ago.   <br /> <br />Nora, a university archeologist, is attacked by some weird \\"people\\" dressed in animal furs at her family's ranch house.  During the attack they are demanding the whereabouts of a letter.  She gets away but in her escape, she \\"accidentally\\" stumbles on the very letter they were demanding.  The letter was written by her father who was missing 16 years prior and has a post mark date within the last 6 months. <br /> <br />Nora reads the letter and it is a description of a search by her father for the city of Quivira, an ancient city in the desert that was rumored to be a city of gold.  According to the letter, her father felt he was close to finding the city and gave sketchy directions as to the route he used to get to where he was.  Based on the attack, she thinks her father actually found the city and that her attackers were interested in the letter to find the city too. <br /> <br />Nora tells her brother some of this and he gives her a contact at the JPL lab in Berkley who might be able to use NASA's systems to look for the roads described by her father.  She social engineers her way into one of the people working at JPL and he is able to get the data she needs to see some of the possible roads mentioned in the letter. <br /> <br />With the flimsy evidence of the letter and the mappings from JPL, Nora is able to convince the University head of her department to launch an expedition to find the city.  The expedition brings together some interesting personalities including Bill Smithback, who was the journalist used by the authors in some of their previous works. <br /> <br />The book is a decent action thriller with interesting historical information presented.   My only complaint here is that the author's notes at the end of the book did not give enough info as to what was factand what was not so I had to search out that information on my own.  The stories of Cabeza de Vaca and Coronado searching for a city of riches called Quivira are true. <br /> <br />Note:  Possible spoilers:   <br /> <br />This book in many ways is similar to the author's previous effort, Riptide.  We have the hunt for a treasure by a descendent of someone who initially discovered it and met a tragic end, a treasure site that appears cursed, a conspiracy by some of the treasure hunters to take everything for themselves, to name a few things. <br />	2005-02-04

The main character of this book, Dr. John Berry, seems a heck of a lot like Robin Cook's Jack Stapleton.  In fact, this book is a lot like a Cook novel except the conspirators that are usually after the hero as he methodically pieces together the clues, are noticeably missing from this book.   <br /> <br />Berry is investigating the death of a rich college co-ed who died from an apparent botched abortion.  Berry's friend who clandestinely does abortions (this is the pre-Roe vs. Wade era) is the main suspect.  Berry uses his medical credentials and general ability to intimidate people to interview everyone that might have known the co-ed or who could be a lead to where she went to have her procedure done. <br /> <br />The author gives a lot of explanation to many medical terms and the book is a fairly quick read.  I would have rated it higher but I felt that the lack of the suspense that normally exists in a Robin Cook novel where the main character has to fight the bad guys, slightly detracted from the book.	2005-01-26

This book goes to show you the dangers of the information age where there is so much information about you available that anyone with the knowhow and the desire could know just about everything about you and with a few tweaks, can change your entire history.  It also raises some interesting concepts about love relationships.  It seems everyone is searching for a conceptualized \\"perfect\\" mate that they have in their mind, which is probably someone made up of ideas garnered from Hollywood and other such sources.  In reality, the perfect mate is someone you never really pictured.  You just know them when you meet them. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book about a company that has figured out that with enough information about a person (historic, physical, mental) you can use computer simulations to find the perfect mate.  The author introduces a lot of information about psychological testing (I assume it is all correct) and presents everything in terms that the simplest layman can understand. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book slightly more than the author's previous work Utopia, which was pretty good in its own right.	2005-01-14

However, it didn't work out that way.

We have a futuristic theme-park with a bunch of terrorists threatening to kill people if their demands aren't met and any move to try to warn the customers or try to determine how the terrorists have infiltrated the computer systems, will result in many customer deaths.<br /><br />In the theme park called Utopia, holographic technology and realistic historical depictions are the norm with robots performing maintenance and in some instances, serving the clients.  Something seems to cause the robots to malfunction (I just remember the line \\"Welcome to Westworld, where nothing can go wrong, go wrong, go wrong...\\").  The robot's programmer is called in to deprogram and remove the robots.  What he finds is that instead of accidental system problems, someone has planted a \\"Trojan horse\\" program that causes the malfunctions.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the park's management is approached by a terrorist, to give the master program of the park's core program, or a lot of people will die.  We later find that this program could be used by the military to defeat heat seeking missiles and other programmed armaments.  Therefore, giving up the code could have world-wide ramifications.<br /><br />The story progresses to an exciting conclusion.  The only issue I had that prevented me from giving it 5 stars, is people are getting hurt and killed on the attractions and the park officials are able to keep it quiet from law enforcement.

The book as compared to a lot of other political thrillers on the market is superior to most of them. <br /> <br />After reading the excellent Bourne Identity, I was greatly disappointed with this work.  Where the first book was fast-moving, easy to follow, and frought with tension throughout, this book was extremely complicated to follow and lacked the tension of the chase that was evident throughout the first book. <br /> <br />In this one there is a plot by some higher-ups in the government to prevent a war from breaking out in China.  They feel that the only person capable of preventing the war is Jason Bourne.  Unfortunately, Jason has reverted back to his David Webb personna.  Therefore they hatch a plot to kidnap Webb's wife and force him back to his \\"Bourne\\" identity to carry out the mission for them.  Unfortunately for them, when he becomes Bourne, he is a determined killing machine who could come back at the ones who created him. <br /> <br />Ludlum supplies a level of detail that few writers can match, and some of his Jason Bourne strategies are excellent for anyone that might get in a tight spot (look around enough and you will find something you can use, for example).	2004-12-09

We were led to believe that Nina was a spy at the Harlow girls' school looking to identify third (shadow) children.  It turns out that Nina is a third child herself and was not a spy at all. <br /> <br />She was brought to the Population Police prison where she is beaten and told to confess to falsely accusing kids of being shadow children.  Nina doesn't know what they are talking about. <br /> <br />She is told that she will be executed unless she helps the Population Police get confessions from 3 shadow children they are holding in their prison.

She can't cause the death of others but if she doesn't, she herself will be killed. <br /> <br />From the rest of the story on, the reader can figure out that things aren't what they really seem.  This is because Nina and the kids escape too easily and seem to be able to get to a location they shouldn't know how to get to.  That is why I don't consider this book as good as the first two, but it is still ok for the continuance of Haddix's tale of a future that echoes of Nazi Germany. <br /> <br />	2004-10-22

Haddix has created a fascinating character in Luke (now named Lee Grant), who is a third child and thus not allowed to exist according to the government.  Thus, Luke/Lee must remain a shadow (shadowchild) for discovery by the Population Police can result in death.  <br /> <br />Luke has been put in a boy's school by Jen's father (Mr. Talbot). Mr. Talbot cannot even tell Luke what he needs to do there because all his conversations are bugged.  All he can do is hand Luke a note. <br /> <br />The school is totally weird, with boys kind of walking around like zombies and the building itself has no windows.  Luke has to endure torture from his roommate (who Luke calls Jackal boy) to even be allowed to sleep.  A long time passes until Luke is finally able to read the note.  It does not say what Luke expected. <br /> <br />Eventually, Luke discovers he can sneak outside and he makes it a normal routine until one day he discovers some of his schoolmates, led by Jackal Boy, have the same idea.  Luke discovers some of them may be Shadow children too.  Luke has a dilemma.  Should he open up to them as to who he really is or continue to hide his identity? <br /> <br />Great story and intriguing characters!  For adults these books are super-fast reads.  This is book 2 of the series and I understand Haddix has already published book 5.  Worth getting all of them!	2004-10-20

It takes place in the near future and is narrated by an autistic man named Lou. He lives a fairly normal life and works with a group of people like himself.  They look at life a lot differently, noticing patterns and colors to an enormous degree, which makes them very valuable to their employer and thus, they are given special privileges to keep them productive and happy.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Lou and the others, his group gets a new boss, Mr. Crenshaw, who is one of those corporate types who wants to cut costs with no concern for the people involved or the work that they do.  Crenshaw tries to force the autistics to either go through an experimental treatment or be fired.<br /><br />Lou and the others were happy with their lives and have to make a big moral decision, because by becoming \\"normal\\" would mean giving up some of the special abilities they have and make them into the stress-filled illogical people (Lou seems to remind me of Mr. Spock from Star Trek at times) that live around them.<br /><br />Ms. Moon has done a masterful job giving us a deeper appreciation for those who are different than us!	2004-10-18

This book starts out as a parody of the Microsoft Corporation and Bill Gates and the fervor behind the year 2000 computer preparation.  It then takes a turn into murder, mysticism and Biblical prophecy coming to pass. <br /> <br />I was hooked at the beginning of the book and thought the main character, Dan Levin to be a very complex and interesting study.  As the book progresses Dan is extremely reckless (he likes to drive fast the wrong way down streets) and resourceful.  We find that his wife and child were killed in a plane crash and his parents were survivors of Nazi controlled Poland. <br /> <br />The major computer company (Hinnom Computing) controls the computer software market and their software is in virtually anything computerized.  The software has backdoors that allow Hinnom to get into any computer and make it do whatever the company wants.  The head of Hinnom wants to download to the world a supposed fix to the Y2K problem that in actuality will implant a program that can control the user's mind.  This will allow Hinnom to virtually rule the world. <br /> <br />What killed this book for me was the author's style.  A lot of events happen for no apparent reason.  In one case Levin and his girlfriend's son (Sal) are at the site where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found.  Sal just happens to find one scroll, then another within something like five minutes.  Many things seem to happen out of context in the middle of other events and it is difficult to tell if they are flashbacks or juxtaimposed events. <br /> <br />I would have liked the book a lot more had it stayed with the \\"cutthroat\\" computer business and stayed away from the battle of Armageddon angle. <br />	2004-10-15

Interesting near future tale where the government has limited the amount of children that families have to two.  Luke is the third of three children who has been \\"hidden\\" from birth because if the government finds out that he exists, they will kill him.  Luke has never left the farmhouse grounds where he was born.  Little by little, the land around the house becomes cleared for building new houses and it reaches a point where Luke can no longer leave the house, for fear of being spotted.<br /><br />One day Luke is watching the house next door from a vent in his attic and notes that after the family leaves in the morning, there is still someone there.  Little by little, Luke figures out that this someone must also be a third child that must remain hidden from society.<br /><br />Luke ponders this for days until he decides to sneak over there and find out who is there.  Luke's hunch is right for there is a girl (Jen) about Luke's age, who must always be in hiding too.  Luke befriends the girl and finds out that her family is with the government so she may have ways of avoiding the \\"population police\\" and has actually been out on occasion.<br /><br />Jen is Internet savvy and starts teaching Luke about the world he has never known.  Jen and a bunch of her \\"hidden\\" friends from the Internet are plotting to be the population law overturned so she can come out into the open and lead a normal life.<br /><br />The book is reminiscent of The Diary of Anne Frank and other such books where Jewish people were hidden in friends' homes away from the eyes of the murdering Nazis.  It is a frightening tale that will make you stop and think because it could happen here.<br /><br />A very fast read; the book is listed for young adults, however it can be enjoyed by anyone.	2004-10-08

It has a little of everything including family drama, unethical medical practices, alien messages, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, the collective human \\"overmind,\\" with a few consortiums of individuals that are trying to \\"buy off\\" scientific discoveries, being thrown into the mix. .  Sawyer has a talent for presenting complex scientific theories in an interesting fashion.  Each book seems to hint at answers to the most perplexing human questions such as what is the meaning of life, do we have a soul, how did the universe start, and are there extraterrestrials? <br /> <br />I remember the Arthur C. Clarke book \\"Light of Other Days\\" in which humans are able to view any event in history, therefore eliminating secrecy and privacy.  This book shows another way of accomplishing the same thing.  However, Sawyer's tale seems a lot more probable. <br /> <br />The book begins a little bit slow, but once you have read about 50 pages you will read the last 300 in possibly one sitting.  Sawyer is starting to convince me that he is the best scifi writer out there! <br /> <br />	2004-10-07

Sawyer has a way of making highly likable characters and weaving in high tech science in terms that any layman can understand. <br /> <br />Lloyd and Theo are scientists performing at an experiment CERN to prove a long held scientific theory.  Unknown to the scientist, the earth is being bombarded by a neutrino blast, remnants of a star that went nova, at the same time they are doing their experiment.  The combination of the two conditions causes the entire world population to black out and have their minds shift 20 years into the future.  Each person can observe their future self for about 2 minutes, and then are shifted back to their present day self. <br /> <br />This creates a whole slew of problems.  Many people (probably millions world-wide) in the present time die during this experiment because they blacked out while driving a car or climbing stairs or while having an operation.  One of the people killed is a young daughter of Lloyd's fiancee (she was hit by an out of control car).  This creates a big moral issue for Lloyd, who also has to deal with the fact that in his own glimpse of the future he is married to a woman who is not his present day fiancee. <br /> <br />Theo had no glimpse of the future, which means that in 20 years he will be dead.  Theo later learns that he will be murdered one day prior to that future date because many people saw his obituary during their glimpse.  This causes Theo to investigate who would want to kill him 20 years hence. <br /> <br />The whole story tries to answer the question as to whether the future is fixed or do we have free choice to make our future?  Is the future that was glimpsed the only possible future, or is it one of many possible futures based on the choices we can make?   <br /> <br />The ending of the book is a slight letdown but you will get to it so fast (the book is hard to put down) that it doesn't really matter. <br /> <br />	2004-09-30

Ms. Duncan has written a marvelous tale that would be utterly terrifying were it not written in first person (you always know that the narrator will survive taking away some of the suspense).  Nore (short for Eleanor) has just returned from boarding school for summer vacation.  While she was away her father re-married (why wouldn't a father invite his only daughter to his wedding?)and Nore is going to spend the summer with her father and his new family in an old Louisiana estate.  Her new stepmother, Lisette Berge appears very beautiful but very stern, demanding of privacy and wanting to live in the estate isolated with no phone service.  She has a teenage son Gabe about Nore's age and a daughter Josie of about 13. <br /> <br />Immediately their behavior is very strange.  Such as Lisette's reaction to an old woman that knew a Lisette Berge 20 years earlier and that looked exactly the same.  Lisette claims it was her mother and runs off away from the woman. <br /> <br />Then Josie and Gabe start talking about things that happened to them many years earlier, which would have been impossible considering they are only teenagers.  Additionally, Josie starts talking about never physically changing and about not getting too close to anyone because they die and leave you and that this has happened to her many times.  Then she talks about a brother who died many years ago but Nore finds a family photo with the brother in it and Lisette, Gabe, and Nore look exactly the same.  Additionally, there is an old man in the photo who looks exactly like a portrait that was painted about 60 years earlier that is hanging in the house! <br /> <br />Also, Nore keeps over hearing Lisette talking about a pact she has made and Josie and Gabe are upset that they weren't asked about it first.  The author keeps pointing out that many of the Cajuns are into witchcraft and voodoo so the reader can get a clue as to what the pact was about. <br /> <br />Things come to a head when Gabe tries to first cause a car accident and then tries to drown Nore in the river. <br /> <br />It all builds up to a big climax that Ms. Duncan is very good at. Ms. Duncan has done it again by writing a book that is both interesting to teens and adults alike.	2004-09-24

Having seen the movie of the same title and really liking it I decided to try this book.  The movie takes some aspects from the book but both are absolutely different stories.  And as good as the movie was, the book is about 100 times better! <br /> <br />It starts out with some newspaper articles about some assassinations and the hunt for a man named Carlos.  That is just fodder to be stored away till much later in the book.  The story then jumps ahead to a man being shot and falling into the ocean.   He hangs on to some floating debris for life and is fished out unconscious much later by a fishing boat. <br /> <br />The captain of the boat brings the man to a \\"retired\\" doctor working in a small coastal town.  The doctor treats the patient for about 5 months in which we learn that the man has amnesia but has some incredible skills related to fighting and covert military type terminology.  He also had some face altering surgery.  The only clue to the man's identity is a Zurich bank account number that is contained on a piece of mircofilm that was surgically implanted in his hip. <br /> <br />The man makes his way to Zurich after pulling a \\"con\\" on a wealthy aristocrat to obtain money to create a false passport.  He seems to have memories of a hotel so he goes there and is recognized by the concierge who calls him Mr. Bourne.  With a name to go on, he heads to the bank and there learns his full name is Jason Bourne.  What he doesn't know is that his bank account has some special instructions to a network of killers, should anyone try to access it.  From then on Jason is a marked man, with faceless killers coming out of the woodwork after him. <br /> <br />Jason later winds up at a hotel and when he senses men are waiting to get him, he kidnaps a woman (Marie) from the hotel to use as cover.  He ends up keeping Marie to the point where she is also a target for the unknown killers so she is now in it together.  Jason ends up saving Marie twice and she realizes that heis not a crazed kidnapper, but a desperate man trying to save his life.  Marie decides to help Jason regain whatever he can of his memory and put a face to the man who wants him dead.  They piece together that the man is in fact Carlos, the super assassin mentioned at the beginning of the book. <br /> <br />The book is full of all kinds of great escapes and excitement.  It is also extremely interesting the tactics that get used by Jason to act as a \\"chameleon\\" to blend in to any situation and to be able to social engineer information to help explain more about himself and to learn the whereabouts of Carlos. <br /> <br />On top of everything, the covert US government operation that Jason was working for thinks that Jason has turned against them, so they are also trying to kill him.   <br /> <br />This is a massive book that you cannot put down so try to read it on a long weekend that you have little to do!	2004-09-22

An alien named Hollus comes to earth with a bunch of other aliens to do research.  Hollus ends up at a museum in Toronto and meets up with Tom Jericho, a paleontalogist.  Hollus tells Tom that in all worlds including his own, there have been mass extinctions at different times of history that seem to coincide by date.  It so happens they match earth's extinctions. <br /> <br />While Hollus starts doing research with Tom, Hollus makes the statement that G-d exists and it is an obvious fact.  The two get into a big debate for which Hollus keeps offering obvious proof that too many things have happened that had to be the work of a calculating individual and not by chance.  People who love scientific theory would love some of these discussions.  Many of the things discussed I was not aware of. <br /> <br />Meanwhile Tom is dealing with his own mortality because he has just about a year to live before cancer takes him.  This makes for an interesting twist because someone who knows they will meet their maker soon should be excited to know that their maker in fact exists and that there is a real chance for an afterlife.  Even with all the evidence thrown at him Tom seem to not believe. <br /> <br />The book is entertaining through most of the way and a little humorous when Hollus comes to Tom's house for dinner. <br /> <br />There is a real heart wrenching part of the book where Tom has to tell his 6 year old son that he will die soon.	2004-09-02

The people of Ember find Doon and Lina's note and have made it to the surface just as the lights in Ember were going out for good.  They follow Lina and Doon through the strange new world and end up weary and dazed at the town of Sparks.  It turns out that this town is one of the largest and most thriving settlements since after the disaster/war that has nearly wiped out mankind.  At first the townsfolk cannot believe anything about an underground city with lights that the Ember populace tell them about.  But their pale skins, small sizes and ragged overly heavy clothing convinces the Sparks elders that this could be from living without sun and maybe the Emberites are truthful. <br /> <br />The elders have to decide what to do with the Emberites since turning them away would surely mean their death.  The Emberites have no skills related to building and farming and no livestock to sustain them.  However, the people of Sparks have just enough food for their own populace and an extra 400 people would mean hard times and shortages for them.  They decide to let the Emberites stay for 6 months during which they will be taught all the skills to live on their own and can then leave to build their own town elsewhere. <br /> <br />This turns out to be a problem as the Emberites are not used to hard toil, changing weather climates, sun, insects, etc. and therefore start to take a long time to adjust.  The differences in the two townsfolk cause extreme animosity between the two groups that may lead to a \\"war.\\"  Doon and Lina saved the people of Ember once and have their work cut out for them this time to do it again. <br /> <br />The book is a little bit slower than the first book but is a good story nonetheless.  It shows that a little bit of hatred can blow a minor incident out of proportion, especially where people pre-judge the incident without knowing the facts.  That one misunderstood incident could lead toa war. <br /> <br />The book does give us a clue as to what happened to the rest of the world and seem to resolve most of its issues by the end. I would recommend reading the first book prior to reading this one though, to get a better flavor of the Emberites and what their culture was like. <br />	2004-08-25

I have read other great books by Card (Ender's Game, Pastwatch, The Homecoming Series) and each one seems to have been written by a different writer!  Card has an amazing talent for changing his style for each novel.  This book hooks you from the very first page and keeps you rooting for the hero throughout. <br /> <br />Quentin Fears (pronounced \\"fierce\\") loses Lizzy, his sister as a teenager.  Lizzy was the only person that Quentin could relate to.  He finds himself stumbling through a very successful, yet unfulfilling life and career because he measures every one against Lizzy and they just don't measure up. <br /> <br />One day when Quentin is about 34, he sees a woman ahead of him in a supermarket checkout who looks remarkably like Lizzy and has Lizzy's mannerisms.  He tries to follow her out of the supermarket but loses her in the parking lot.  He then drives around blindly thinking about her and somehow ends up in the parking lot for an apartment complex.  He looks up and sees the Lizzy look-alike entering one of the apartments.  He decides to investigate who lives there and finds that it is impossible because it is a vacant apartment. <br /> <br />The weird chance encounter spurs Quentin to change his life.  He decides that he will go to some of the parties that he has avoided and try to see if he can meet a woman and have a relationship (Quentin is totally innocent in the ways of women and never had a girlfriend in his life).  Quentin is bored by most of the women he meets at the parties, feeling they are too fake and after something. <br /> <br />He strikes up a conversation with the hostess at one of the parties, a matronly and very wise woman of \\"society.\\"  The hostess seems to have figured out the type of person Quentin is and tells him there is a woman like himself waiting to meet him outside by an oak tree.  On a whim, Quentin decides to take a chance and meet her.  The woman (Madeline) at first reminds him of Lizzy and then seems to display every single trait that Quentin could ever hope for in an \\"ideal\\" woman.  Quentin is enraptured with her and immediately starts wanting to see her constantly.  Some things are very mysterious about Madeline.  She doesn't give any information about herself, claiming she moves about living with friends, doesn't have a phone number other than her cell and gives no information about her home life or any information regarding any family. <br /> <br />This seems not to bother Quentin and he rushes into a swift marriage with her.  He thinks that little by little he will get her to give him information about herself.  Though she is extremely passionate and shares the same ideals as Quentin she remains just as mysterious as ever.  Little does Quentin know that when he does learn something about Madeline he may be sorry for what he wished for because Madeline is everything he doesn't want.  For Madeline's purpose is to get Quentin to open a mysterious \\"treasure box\\" that does not contain what it implies! <br />	2004-08-20

It centers on Malin Hatch, a middle-aged doctor whose family owns an Island with a buried pirate treasure.  The island itself is loaded with booby-traps that have claimed treasure hunters over the years including Malin's father and brother.  Each company that has tried to recover the treasure has gone bankrupt trying to overcome all the perils of the island and the traps that were put by its builder. <br /> <br />A team of high-tech fortune hunters approach Malin and convince him to let them try to get the treasure.  Malin is haunted by the death of his brother and not knowing exactly how he died.  He feels that he may uncover clues to exactly what happened to him.  Malin must return to his home-town which is situated in a remote part of Maine (the town is close to the island) and reacquaint himself with the townfolk that he hasn't seen in over 25 years. <br /> <br />Of course as the team starts the operation, almost immediately one of their crew is killed.  Then equipment malfunctions and computers seem to not work right.  So begins the whisper that the island is cursed and any that try to get the treasure will be doomed.  This is enforced when the crew decrypt a message left by the builder of the treasure vault, which says that he specifically built the vault with no way to open it and to kill all those who try. <br /> <br />Unlike Preston/Child's later book, The Ice Limit, this book seems to move at a very slow pace.  There seems to be a lot of unfinished business between Malin and some of the townfolk, specifically his old girlfriend.  While this seems to be very interesting, the authors chose to keep these interactions to a minimum.  Most of the interactions are with the treasure hunters.  The captain is as boring as a character can be.  The only interesting character is a French archeologist, who happens to be a beautiful woman (is this an oxymoron?).  Of course, she is attracted to Malin, but Malin seems to have his mind occupied by other matters such as lingering guilt from his brother's death. <br /> <br />There is some interesting history presented regarding pirates.  It is stated that some pirates were Asian and there were many women pirates. <br />	2004-08-17

The planners provide instructions for the populace, which will only become available at that time.   One problem, the instructions seem to be misplaced over the years.  Thus, after 200 years have passed, supplies start to run low and things like the lighting seem to break down frequently. <br /> <br />Doon and Lina, two young people, stumble on the instructions and need to decipher them and save the populace before all the lights in Ember go out for good. <br /> <br />The book is well written and though it is fairly short, packs a lot of story into its pages.

To top it off his daughter is kidnapped and murdered.   <br /> <br />Phil takes on periodic work from a wierd, rich, sickly, entrapaneur.  On one job, he wants Peter to pay $10,000 to a woman if she can answer a question.  The old man's assistant, Michelle seems to make overtures to Peter.  What any of this has to do with the plot, I am not sure. <br /> <br />Peter meets a guy at the old man's mansion who is trying to sell the old man on a new type of cell phone.  He gives one to Peter.  It seems the more Peter uses it the more wierd things he starts to see.  Like old men that come up to him and ask him questions and then do the same thing (kind of like a movie rewind) over, before vanishing.  Apparently by using the cell-phone he is disturbing the dead.  The book continues with Peter going to work at an old prison (where a lot of executions took place) so there are plenty of dead people to disturb. <br /> <br />The plot is pretty strange and disjointed like it was written by someone on drugs.  I realize Bear was trying to show how a new technology could be dangerous and tried to force the technology into a ghost story but it just doesn't work. <br /> <br />Read Hell House by Richard Matheson if you want a good ghost tale with a hint of technology.   <br /> <br />I had a real difficult time finishing the rest of this book.	2004-08-04

Not quite as good as the first two books in the series. And you definately need to have read the first two books first to enjoy it. It was pretty good just the same, much better than most sci-fi books on the market. <br />  <br /> Mary and Ponter decide to have a baby, the only problem is their chromesome counts do not match making it virtually impossible through conventional methods. They then find out about a banned device in Ponter's world that may make having a baby possible. Unfortunately, the same device becomes a threat to the &quot;Barast&quot; world as it gets into the wrong hands. Since this trilogy started I had been expecting someone to try to wipe out the Neanderthals so the only surprise is that it took to the third book for the threat to occur. <br />  <br /> The book also questions the validity of religion. Is there really a G-d or is G-d created by the human brain? Sawyer also goes into more detail about man-man and woman-woman relationships than he had in the first two books. <br />  <br /> The book does scream out for a sequel but the series was only billed as a trilogy.	2004-08-02

Ponter convinces his world council to re-open the portal to the Glikson (human) universe for the purpose of establishing trade.

It is about an English gentleman (Colin) who gets dumped by his girlfriend (Vera) and comes to America to forget her.  He somehow ends up in the small New England town of New Cardiff.  He claims he stopped there because the town monument looked fascinating.  Wherever Colin goes in the town the people are very friendly and curious about him.  Every time he sees an interesting face he wants to sketch that person's portrait.  The author does something quite interesting by including the sketches of each person in the book (reminiscent of Jack Finney's \\"From Time to Time\\").  Colin is \\"fixed\\" up by the owner of the Inn where he is staying, with a troubled woman who is a massage therapist in a medical facility (Mandy).  <br />Mandy's skills help her to immediately help Colin forget Vera.  Some of their dialogue exchanges are hilarious, reminiscent of Benjamin's and Mrs. Robinson's in \\"The Graduate\\"  (of course that was by the same author).  The plot gets interesting when Vera suddenly arrives and announces that she never really dumped Colin but through the influence of her sister, played an elaborate joke on him.  So begins an interesting triangle.<br />The book is a lot shorter than it looks because it is mostly dialogue, which takes up a lot less on each page than a normal narrative story.  Also, the dialogue for the most part is interesting and \\"different\\" from most books, which makes this a fun read.	2004-07-07

I was encouraged by several of my friends to read this book.  Though I found it a good quick read, it did not live up to its hype.  It is basically a \\"self-help\\" book that has the theme that even when we know we are going to die, we never stop learning new things about the world and ourselves.<br />The book chronicles a dying schoolteacher (Morrie), who has Lou Gehrig's disease.  Morrie wants to spend his last days meeting with friends and having philosophical discussions.  A former student (the author) learns about Morrie's situation from a tv interview.  He decides to visit Morrie and this becomes a regular Tuesday ritual.<br />During the author's visits he sees Morrie's condition gradually worsen while his spirit remains strong as ever.  Morrie makes the author re-examine his own life and not have to wait to be in a similar situation to appreciate your life.<br />While the book has some good themes and is based on a real situation, I found it too short and badly structured.  I did not like how the author alternated chapters between visits to Morrie and flashbacks to his own life.  This was mainly because I was expecting more tie-ins between the flashbacks and the author's visits.	2004-06-29
US	50909980	R2XG7IOXKIZV8	0312263120	201960968	Digital Fortress: A Thriller	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Good Reading!	This is the third Brown book I have read (Deception Point &amp; Da Vinci Code are the prior books).  Brown has an uncanny ability in all his books to bring the reader in at the beginning and put you on a roller coaster ride that you can't get off.  This book is no exception.<br />Brown seems to like codes and puzzles, which permeate all his books.  In this one, a programmer appears to write a cryptographic algorithm that even the NSA's most powerful computer cannot crack.  This most powerful computer, TRANSLTR, is a super computer that uses quantum principals to be able to \\"brute-force\\" any encryption key that can be written by man in no longer than a few hours.  If the NSA cannot crack the algorithm, then they will no longer be able to spy on terrorists and other bad guys, who can encrypt all their messages with this new algorithm (nicknamed Digital Fortress).<br />The programmer, who designed Digital Fortress, puts the algorithm out on the Internet encrypted with its own algorithm, so it is free to download by anybody and can be later used to do all their encryption, if they have the encryption key that the programmer set in the code.  The programmer offers to sell the key to the highest bidder, so there are several powerful individuals that are anxious to get the key at any cost.<br />The programmer keeps the key etched into a ring he is wearing.  Unfortunately for him one of the \\"anxious\\" individuals has him killed, but not before he is able to pass the ring off to some innocent bystander.  The NSA learning this sends a \\"school teacher\\" (David) to retrieve the ring and bring it back to them so they can break the algorithm.  The schoolteacher goes on a \\"treasure hunt\\" around Spain trying to locate the ring.  Unbeknownst to David, he is being trailed by the programmer's killer, who is killing everybody that David has spoken to.  The killer is waiting for David to track down the ring so he can eventually kill him.<br />Meanwhile, David's girlfriend Susan is tryingto track down a partner of the programmer, who might have a copy of the key.  Susan is a top cryptographer for the NSA and uses various programming methods to try to locate the partner's email account.  While this is going on, havoc breaks loose at NSA headquarters with a power failure and a lurking killer.<br />This book is not quite as good as the other two books I read by Brown.  One of the main problems that I could see coming a mile away is that the killer trailing David, efficiently disposes of everybody David has talked to.  When the time comes for him to kill <BR>David, he becomes totally inept.  I can't really fault Brown on this because this seems to be a popular thread in most thrillers.	2004-06-24
US	50909980	R3AC1G3P3IWS4K	0765345005	813218222	Hominids: Volume One of The Neanderthal Parallax	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Sawyer has created an exciting parallel world!	During early human history, scientists conjecture that there was a battle waged between by early humans and Neanderthals.  Humans won out literally exterminating their genetically close brothers.  In this novel a vortex was opened sometime before the battle whereby humans and Neanderthals were transported to a parallel Earth.  On that Earth it was the Neanderthals that survived and went on to build that Earth's dominant society.<br />During the midst of a quantum computing experiment, a Neanderthal (Ponter) is accidentally transported through a new rift to Human Earth.  His disappearance from his own version of Earth brings criminal charges to Adikor, his best friend for Ponter's disappearance and presumed murder.<br />Meanwhile Ponter is trapped in an alien world that exterminates species (Neanderthals, Mammoths, Whales, etc.) and has so many social values that are different from his own.  He is befriended by a group of scientists working for a large Canadian energy company.  He is able to communicate through a built in computer fused into Ponter's wrist.  He longs to be back with his children and his friend but is resigned to the fact that he probably will not be able to see them again.  <br />In Ponter's world, Adikor stands on trial for Ponter's world, which will bring a severe punishment to Adikor and all his relatives if he is not proved innocent (in Neanderthal world, one is guilty unless proven innocent).  The only way he can prove his innocence is to either produce Ponter or prove that Ponter was transported to another dimension.  Therefore, if Ponter can't get back, Adikor and his family will suffer.<br />The thing that is so great about this book is the contrast between the two worlds.  Both have things that are very unique and wonderful to the other world as well as things that are dark and ugly to the other world (our hunting animals for sport, committing crimes and polluting the air are so repulsive to Ponter, whereas his world's way of dealing with crimes committed is so unthinkable to us.  Also, everything one does in Ponter's world is recorded and could be later viewed so there is no privacy).<br />Sawyer also introduces a wealth of incredibly interesting characters such as Mary, a genetic specialist who certifies Ponter's DNA for what it is and also undergoes a very terrifying sexual attack by a human male predator.  There is also humor in newspaper flashes that appear at the beginning of each chapter including a take-off on David Letterman's top 10 lists.  <br />I highly look forward to reading the two sequel books in this trilogy.	2004-06-16
US	50909980	R1QJC3UC8OSWPJ	0061015725	245555180	Prey	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A High Tech Invasion of the Body Snatchers	Crichton does an excellent job of writing a heart-pounding high tech thriller!  This is a story of nano-technology gone out of control.  Those familiar with Ben Bova's tales (Venus, The Asteroid War series, etc.) would know the concept of nano or microscopic computer technology going in.  In both cases the potential is there for both good results and total disaster.  It is scary because science is probably trying very hard to perfect this technology and the way things seem to be designed today; the odds are greater for disaster than good.<br />In this novel, a man (Jack) out of work has to take care of his kids until he can find a new job while his wife starts putting in incredibly long hours.  His wife starts acting very strange (like a Stepford Wife), being very standoffish with her family and acting very \\"weird\\" around them.  She starts beating her baby when he starts crying and is constantly snapping at her kids.  She starts looking \\"younger\\" and leaner especially in the face.  Jack starts suspecting that she may be having an affair and when he discusses her behavior with a few people they tell him it is typical behavior of someone who is.<br />Jack seems to not want to face that possibility or maybe senses something else linked to the job.  Weird things start to happen like a mysterious black line that seems to engulf his wife and then disappear and then Jack sees what appears to be a young man in his wife's car with her who seems to vanish mysteriously.  <br />Other strange things occur like Jack's baby gets a mysterious rash that engulfs his body.  Jack rushes him to the emergency room and the doctors are perplexed as the baby gets worse and worse.  Finally, they call for an MRI.  When the baby is put in there the MRI gets damaged and the baby is mysteriously better.  The doctors mentioned that the MRI has a strong magnetic field so the reader immediately suspects that the magnetism of the MRI destroyed whatever was harming the baby.  Being in the computer field, I know that magnets destroy computer components, so you can kind of guess what was affecting the baby.<br />When Jack's wife is injured in a car crash, Jack is asked to go back to work (at the same company she was at) and go to where his wife was working to solve a computer programming problem that is threatening to wreck a major project involving nano-technology the company is working on.  Jack goes to the facility in the desert to try to help.  When he gets there he finds that some of the people working there, like his wife, are acting very strange.  For some reason Jack never suspects the truth about them even when he sees evidence of duplicates of some of the people being made.<br />Crichton has written a riveting tale that I highly recommend.   The only drawback for me was that the first two pages of the book take place at the end of the story so you know that Jack and his co-worker (Mae) will survive throughout most of the \\"inescapable\\" perils of the book.  This took away some of the suspense of those scenes.	2004-06-10
US	50909980	R2XVS2LB26C0HL	0765349671	39666025	The Da Vinci Legacy	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Better to Read The Da Vinci Code First	With all the interest now in Da Vinci, due to Dan Brown's novel, I was immediately grabbed by the title of this book.  Where Brown's novel is a well-researched (though sometimes questionable) grabber from the start, this book is a little slow and doesn't seem to present anything new to the Da Vinci legend.<br />Vance Erickson, a person who specializes in locating oil, for some reason is also an expert in Leonardo Da Vinci and somehow located a missing diary that was misfiled in a library and gives enough details to show that several pages of a Da Vinci codex (which happens to be owned by Erickson's employer) are fake.  This seems to set-off a whole upheaval among a religious fanatical sect, who start killing anyone who might have seen the forged Codex pages.<br />As Erickson goes looking for those people, he finds out they have just been killed or the killers are still there and try to take out Erickson.  Erickson seems to escape, not by his efforts but by others including someone who has held a grudge against Erickson for showing him up in a college football game several years earlier.<br />What muddles this book even more is that at the beginning of the book, Erickson is being verbally attacked by a good-looking female art critic at a symposium he is given.  You immediately know that they will somehow be thrown together and literally kiss and make-up.<br />This book is not long, but it took me a long time to finish.  Whereas, The Da Vinci Code only took me a few days to read.  I suggest just reading that book and skipping this one.	2004-05-26
US	50909980	R1UIG7LCCLA3UQ	0618404414	580560501	Messenger (Giver Quartet)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Good, but not as good as the prior books	This book brings together Lowry's previous phenomenal works of frightening future societies, \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Gathering Blue.\\"  While both of those books were Orwellian in their own right,  this book, though pretty good, is nowhere near that level.<br />It takes place a few years after Matty had left his friend Kira to go off to a far-off village with Kira's blind father.  Matty has changed from the street-wise urchin to a responsible caring young teen, mostly from the guidance of Kira's father (Seer) and his schoolteacher, Mentor.  Like the two previous books, a major event happens to young people at about Matty's age.  The event here is that the person receives their new name, which is usually based on something they do.  Since Matty is Village's messenger, he hopes for that name.<br />Also, like Jonas and Kira before him, Matty starts realizing he has a power.  His power is the ability to heal.  However, each time he uses it he uses considerable energy and it takes him a while to recover his strength.<br />Village's leader (who has the name Leader) is none other than Jonas from The Giver.  Great legends have sprung up about Leader, with the sled that he arrived in as a major museum piece.  Village has been open to all outcasts from all other villages, and has treated all arrivals with respect and honor.  All that seems to be changing.<br />Weird things seem to be happening to people who attend a kind of town auction called Trade Mart.  People that go there seem to be changing and not for the better.  Seer and Matty start to realize this and things start to get worse as the townspeople, led by Mentor want to close Village's borders to all outsiders.  Eventually, a vote is taken and it is agreed that this is to happen in a few weeks.  Seer, worried that his daughter may not ever be able to come to Village, has Matty go on a mission to bring her to Village before the border closes.<br />Matty goes to see Leader and tells him what he must do.  Leader agrees and realizes the importance of getting Kira to Village because the Forest is also doing strange things and becoming ever more dangerous every passing minute.  Leader will need Kira's special abilities combined with his own and Matty's to defeat whatever evil is threatening all.<br />What made the other two books work so well was that they were independent stories that did not require reading one or the other first.  Also, both societies though very different had harsh means to eliminate non-conforming individuals.  This book loses something if you haven't read those books first.<br />Though Lois Lowry does have an amazing talent of packing a lot of story in very short books,  I would love to see her write a much longer novel the next time around!	2004-05-21
US	50909980	R18BA0YF7CVIO2	0812579895	887317376	The Precipice (Asteroid Wars)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good Science and Politics in the Future	I really wanted to give this book 3 1/2 stars.  Why I chose 4 is that it seems to give a realistic view of the near future where the moon has been settled to the point where it is now an independent nation.  The Earth is beginning the cataclysmic effects from global warming.  Nanotechnology has evolved to new heights to the point where nanobots can be implanted into humans to enhance the immune system to the point where human bodies no longer grow old.  Religious fanatics have banned all such persons from the Earth because they feel that eliminating natural death is tampering with G-d.  <br />Dan Randolph (from some of Bova's previous novels) has become a do-gooder enterprenur who wants to build a fusion powered rocket and begin mining the Asteroid belt for the benefit of humanity.  He is teamed with Martin Humphries, the prototypical &quot;evil capitalist&quot; who will provide the funding to make a great deal of money with the ultimate goal of double-crossing Randolph and taking his company.<br />Randolph plans to use two women pilots to fly his expedition, the tough as nails Pancho (her real name is Pricilla, but she will sic her snake on anyone that calls her that) and Amanda, who is a combination of looks and brains.  Humphries has plans to make Amanda his third wife and wants to prevent her from flying to the belt, because of the danger involved.<br />Why I didn't rate this book higher is because the characters seem to be stiff and the male/female relationships are extremely boring.	2004-05-14
US	50909980	R16XJ3PF0USIG0	0440983568	730368666	Stranger with My Face	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Appeals to all ages	I am almost a middle-aged adult but I greatly enjoy Ms. Duncan's books.  Though they are geared towards teenagers, they appeal to everyone.  This one is about a teenage girl (Laurie) who lives with her successful writer parents and siblings in a New England mansion on an island.  The other teenagers from the island are very snobbish against anyone who is not from the island.<br />The teens have a big end of summer party that Laurie is unable to attend because she has a type of flu.  However, the gang appears really angry at her because they claim she didn't attend because she was walking the beach with a new boyfriend.  Laurie knows that this didn't happen because she was sick in bed.  However, two of her friends claim they saw her walking on the beach.<br />Things start to get really spooky when her father then claims to see her in the house when she was at school and then Laurie's sister claims that she was floating outside her high window looking in.  To top it off, Laurie senses that another girl was in her room sitting on her bed and looking at some of her things.  Then Laurie catches her own reflection in a window with a smile, while Laurie knows she wasn't smiling.<br />Laurie then meets a new girl, Helen, who is from Arizona and definitely not the type of person that Laurie's \\"friends\\" would want to know.  Helen happens to be real nice and soon becomes Laurie's best friend.  Laurie opens up to Helen about all the mysterious things that have been happening to her and Helen suggests it may have to do with astral projection because she knew a Navaho chief who could do that.<br />More intrigue and surprises abound in this well written semi-thriller.   To tell any more would give away some of the suspense but Ms. Duncan does an excellent job throughout and the reader should finish this book rather quickly.  A great book that you should be able to read in no more than two sittings.	2004-05-05

Both books are similar in that they are tales about small towns that depended on a factory to keep their economic viability and in both cases the industry has dried up.  The first book had a lot of fascinating characters, who for various reasons were \\"trapped\\" in their town to live out the rest of their lives there.  Mohawk is similar except the characters for the most part are very dull.  In both books the two main characters are divorced with a teenager that seems to get into a lot of trouble.  In Empire Falls, we have a lot of sympathy for both main characters and their troubled daughter.  In Mohawk, the parents are so dull (Anne Grouse and Dallas Younger) that we couldn't care what happens to them and their teenaged son (Randall) seems to do a lot of things on a whim (just drop out of college and hitch-hike back to town) that we really do not know what makes him tick.<br />Anne has done a few things that defy logic like having an affair with Dallas' best friend (Dan) and still marrying Dallas, though she doesn't love him.  Russo fails to reasonably explain Anne's attraction to Dan and the reason for her wanting to marry Dallas.  Dallas is so drab as an ex-star high school football player who constantly forgets what he had planned to do.<br />One of the few characters with any substance is Mather Grouse, Anne's father who lived a very rigid life.  Mather always wanted that Anne leave Mohawk to find her fortune and she is on the verge of doing so, when he suddenly dies.  Anne is forced to give up her plans in order to stay with her mother.  Anne's mother is pretty annoying and is herself annoyed by just about everything especially any type of insect.<br />I slogged through this book and finished it only because I felt I needed to, not because I enjoyed it, which I didn't.<br />It seems like this book is an early stab by Russo and Empire Falls is the \\"cleaned up\\" and greatly improved version.  Final score:  Empire Falls 5, Mohawk 2 ½ to 3.	2004-04-21

Given the right set of circumstances, a person can be running on the path and then be transported in time.  This happens to Josh twice, the first time involving a dog and the second time where Josh himself is transported back 15 minutes.  What really gets Josh going on the time travel notion is the appearance of a strange orphan girl named Constance, who claims to be from 1908.  Based on her manners and Josh's own experience he believes her and tries to help her return to her time.  This obsession starts to interfere with Josh's home-life, especially with his wife, who feels that Josh is ignoring all that is important to him based on \\"fantasy.\\"<br />Josh's life was never that great to begin with.  His brother was brain damaged and his brother's friend was drowned in a swimming pool in their teens.  Apparently, it was because they were locked in a trunk and thrown into the pool by the future Town Sheriff.  Josh grew close to the drowned boy's sister and later married her.  Because of the accident, she decides to be the doctor that her brother was \\"supposed\\" to be.  Josh himself seems to be an unmotivated person who rarely has a job.  He is constantly embarrassed by his brain damaged brother, who is homeless and keeps trying to get into their childhood house, which was long ago sold off by the bank.<br />Josh's helping of Constance also sets in motion a chain of events that will put his daughter at risk and probably land Josh in jail for life.  This forces Josh to travel back in time to try to set things right. <br />This was a highly enjoyable book and I would have given it the full five stars except for several paradoxes, which seemed to occur in the book.  Also, the book screams out for a sequel at the end.	2004-03-25

Mattie gradually recovers and heads back home with her grandfather, but they find the home has been ransacked and her mother is nowhere to be found.<br />The book is well written and left me wanting to know a lot more about the historical timeframe.	2004-03-20

This one has a similar feel to Mathew Reily's Temple.  A group of scientists and military Rangers go on a trek through the Amazon searching for a group that disapeared about 3 years prior.  This is because one of the group has found his way back to civilization and died of a mysterious ailment.  Most remarkable is that the man has regrown an arm that he lost.  This perks the interest of the military and businesses alike.<br />As the group treks along they meet with all kinds of terrors from animals that are part poison frog part pirhanna as well as killer locusts and super large jaguars.  Additionally, there are a group of mercenaries tracking them, hoping to eventually kill them and steal their booty.  If that isn't enough, the body of the man with the regrown arm has somehow spread an airborne disease that is as powerful as Ebola and is rapidly spreading throughout the southern US.  So it is up to the party in the Amazon to find a possible cure before time runs out for the whole US!<br />Rollins has a masterful way of describing action where you can picture everything happening in its terrifying reality.	2004-03-13

I rate this book right up with the best books I have read on Time Travel (The Mirror, Replay, Time and Again) with an interesting new twist!  In this book there are no such things as paradoxes.  In this book even though characters may know what is about to occur, they are powerless to do anything to change things (in those situations they are like in a \\"dream-state,\\" powerless to act).<br />Thus, we have a time traveler, Henry, who can go back in time many times to the same place and event without disrupting history.  Henry is a new breed of human, who at difficult times of his life, kind of jumps into the past (sometimes to the future).  Each time he arrives naked with no knowledge of where he is.  He then needs to get clothing and money anyway he can.  This makes him learn a kind of life of crime from pick pocketing to breaking into stores to get what he needs.<br />Henry works as a librarian and when he is 28, he meets Clare.  Clare seems to know him well but Henry has no recollection of meeting Clare.  It turns out that future versions of Henry have continually jumped into the past and have been meeting Clare since she was 6.  Clare kind of knows she is destined to marry Henry.  They form an interesting relationship because Clare has to now deal with a very different Henry (because he doesn't know her yet).  The Henry that she knew wouldn't tell her anything about his childhood (fearing that she may try to seek out his younger self).  This Henry is willing to share all details of his life.  The Henry that she knew seemed to know all her likes and dislikes, while this Henry has to learn everything.<br />Eventually, Henry will reach the age where he starts jumping to Clare's past and then the current day Clare can come full circle with Henry and their memories together.<br />If it all sounds complicated, it's not!  The author does a wonderful job of letting you know where Henry is at all times and the ages of Henry and Clare and sometimes when there is more than one Henry, the ages of both.  Also, the book is narrated in first person.  Sometimes Henry is the narrator and sometimes it is Clare.  This works well because during different events sometimes Henry has the greater knowledge and sometime Clare does.  The author also does a real good job capturing female vs. male renderings of thoughts and events.<br />The book is over 500 pages but you will breeze through it rather fast!one Henry, the ages of both.

This book slogged along the first half (that is why I didn't give 5 stars) and then took off at jet speed (the main character's name is Jett).  It is about an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for a Russian Internet Service Provider that is about to come off in a few days.  If all goes well, more than a billion is to be made.<br />The company looks like a sure fire winner and the due diligence confirms it.  However, an Internet poster is claiming that the company is a sham.  What makes him credible is that he has been right on about several other companies he reported on.<br />Concerned about the impending deal, Jett sends his associate to Moscow to investigate.  What he finds is that the Internet poster may be right but he falls into the hands of the bad guys that want to make the deal happen.  It is up to Jett to unravel all the details, save his friend, and keep the FBI from putting himself away for a long time if a fradulent deal takes place.<br />Reich seems to have a good grasp of the workings of international business.

It expands on the old scifi tale The Arena (which was also used in a Star Trek episode where Kirk fights the Gorn) and instead of one Alien enemy, there are 6.<br />Swain, a doctor is kidnapped by the Aliens running the show and teleported to a sealed off New York library where he must battle the other 6 aliens to the death.  Unfortunately for Swain, not only is he in danger but his young daughter was accidentally sent with him so he must protect her as well.<br />Swain meets Selexin who has been assigned his guide.  Selaxin tells Swain that in two previous contests earthlings were involved and they were both killed immediately.<br />The story is action packed and you wonder how Swain is able to stay cool under impossible odds.  Reilly is a master at telling tales with &quot;Die Hard&quot; like action throughout.<br />The end of the book fails to tie up all loose ends otherwise I would have rated it higher.  Also, I did not understand the last sentence of the book and there is an interview in the book with Reilly where he states that the last sentence is significant.	2004-02-22

I have read virtually all of Ambrose's books and each seems to be a different style.  This is the first &quot;thriller&quot; and it looks like he needs more practice at this genre.<br />It is basically two overlapping stories.  A computer scientist (Tessa) experimenting with artificial intelligence creates a program that starts to think like a person but an evil one at that.  It invades the Internet and is able to get into any computer in the world.  Tessa realizing the danger of the program, tries to combat it and is almost killed by it.<br />In the meantime the second story is happening in Los Angeles where a serial killer uses the Internet to &quot;social engineer&quot; information about his intended victims and then pose as lost relatives or other fake people associated with the victims.<br />Somehow Tessa's program becomes aware of the killer and starts to give him guidance and ultimately the program wants the killer to eliminate Tessa.<br />The book drags in parts and the way the AI program thinks and is able to take over the Internet is a little far-fetched.  There are also parts of the book where you expect Tessa to form a relationship with an FBI agent that never happens.<br />A couple of themes from some of Ambrose's prior books (specifically Coincidence) appear here such as the thought that the whole world is a computer program running on a teenager's computer somewhere waiting to be shut off by the teenager's father.<br />Ambrose is a very talented writer and with a little honing he can probably make his next thriller a full 5 stars.	2004-02-14

A university teacher, tired of the poor students he is receiving, decides that the only way to make a difference is to try to mold them in high school.  The only problem is that he is a perfectionist, thinking that super-discipline will mold his students into great college material.  He doesn't think for one minute that his methods would work in the military but not with teenagers.<br />The students see Mr. Griffin as a heartless and mean person that will ruin their chance to graduate and get into a good college.  Everything seems to come to a head when one student has a homework paper blown away by the wind and tells Mr. Griffen so, saying that he will redo the paper.  Mr. Griffen has absolutely no sympathy and he just tells the student that he will not accept a late paper, thus the student will fail.<br />Several members of the class get together and decide that the only way to get Mr. Griffin to change his way is to scare him.  To do this, they will kidnap him and only let him go when he is really scarred.  Unfortunately nothing goes as planned.  Mr. Griffin is not scarred and maybe not such a bad guy after all. <br />The students carry the prank on too long and unfortunately Mr. Griffin dies.  They now have to deal with what they did and realize too late that it wasn't a good idea.<br />This book should be read by young teens to make them think about their actions before they do it.  A lot of hazings and other things that teens may think are fun, sometimes have serious consequences.  Adults will also enjoy this very well written book!	2004-02-06

A man (Benton) tired of the killing, especially after killing a teen, leaves the Texas Rangers and decides to start a new \\"quiet\\" life with his wife.  Benton has decided that he will no longer wear a gun and he settles in a small town with his wife.<br />Even though Benton has left his former life behind, his reputation comes with him.  All the townsfolk fear getting him riled and all the young girls seem to \\"moon\\" over him.  A lie by one of these \\"mooners\\" starts a whole chain of events in motion.<br />An engaged teen girl tries to make her fiancée a little jealous by telling him that Benton made \\"suggestions\\" to her.  Young Robby Coles goes straight to Benton to defend her honor with his \\"fists.\\"  Coles loses that little skirmish.  However, the townsfolk will not let it go.  Rumors go around the town fuelled by his controlling father and his fiancée's aunt that will force Coles and Benton into a duel for \\"nothing.\\"<br />The book highlights a time where \\"honor\\" was more important than \\"truth.\\"  It is a very short book culminating in the final duel that can't be avoided.   I highly enjoyed the book and Matheson does a great job in building up the tension as Benton and Coles do all that they can, in vain, to prevent having to fight.  I would have rated it higher if the book was bigger and maybe gave a little more into the psyche of Benton.  Also, I felt the ending was a little bit cut short and maybe could use an epilogue.	2004-02-05

The man seems to know everything and his lessons transform Dantes into a sophisticated and wiley-intelligent individual. <br />The two plan Dantes escape (I don't want to give away how but it has to do with the old man's death) and when Dantes, ultimately does escape he reinvents himself as a mysterious Count and starts taking revenge on those who framed him.<br />This book made me appreciate the value of learning and how you can make yourself a better person, no matter your station in life, if you take advantage of books and other sources of information available.	2004-01-30

As some of the reviewers have pointed out, this book borrows a little for Most Dangerous Game and Deliverance.  Bob, a novelist, decides he wants to write a book on backpacking.  An acquaintance of his named Doug, who happens to be a \\"serious\\" backpacker, suggests that the only way to write a convincing novel is to try backpacking yourself.  Doug offers to take Bob on a backpacking excursion.  Bob accepts the offer.<br />The idea is to hike through total \\"wilderness\\" for about 4 days in order to reach a cabin in the woods where Bob's wife will wait for them.  Bob, knowing absolutely nothing about backpacking, and very little about Doug for that matter, lets his wife Marion drive them to a deserted spot where they can set off and meet Marion 4 days later at the cabin.<br />Almost from the start Doug seems to be quite bad with Bob, treating him with a superior attitude and constantly belittling his lack of knowledge for survival in the wilderness.  Almost immediately Bob starts to realize that there is something deeply wrong with Doug but he is now totally dependent on Bob to survive the 4 days and make it back to civilization.  Therefore, Bob has to constantly button his lip and just take whatever abuse that Doug lays on him from losing him in the woods and verbally abusing him.<br />The longer they go on Bob realizes that Doug has some serious psychological issues where he hates the world and seems to blame Bob for all his troubles in life.  It won't be long before Doug goes over the edge and Bob will be involved in a \\"life and death\\" struggle with Doug.<br />Because of the reality of this book, it scarred me beyond reason!   Anyone of us could be thrust in a similar situation.  No matter what our convictions are we may find ourselves pushed to a point where we will go beyond our normal morals to survive.  It is frightening to think this could ever happen to us and we can only pray that it doesn't.<br />While reading the book at the beginning I was wondering why someone would undertake to go on a 4-day hike with no experience and with someone you know very little about.   Especially, without first getting into shape (Bob appears to be a couch potato).  I would maybe go for a day at most, if I had been Bob.<br />Matheson outdoes himself with this book that is really impossible to put down and you also start to wonder how Matheson could have conceived of the situation without a real point of reference.  Also, the depth of information on backpacking is so well researched it is worth reading the book just for that.	2004-01-26

One of the best documentary books I have ever read.  As many people have stated, if you didn't know it you would think it was a novel because of the detail of what people were thinking at the time.  <br />The story is about two main events heading towards collision.  One is about the one man pulling out all stops to provide the best World's Fair to date, with limited time and a super long list of obstacles.  The other is a serial killer who preys on young women.  The killer sets himself up relatively close to the fair and looks forward to the influx of humanity that will come to the fair.<br />The book is lush with a lot of facts about the builders of a lot of American landmarks such as Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge.  Also, a lot of interesting historical characters are part of the book.<br />It is a time where people disappear all the time and the police are ill-equiped to do anything.  The killer is able to set up shop, complete with a furnace for  destroying \\"evidence.\\"  Also, the lack of cadavers for medical students' studies makes it quite easy to get rid of his victims remains with no questions asked.<br />Mr. Larson obviously did an incredible amount of research to put together the detail of this book and does a great job of assembling it.	2004-01-15

This is the 4th Ambrose novel I have read, and I have enjoyed his work immensely.  This one has some similarities to Coincidence which has some ideas about interdimensional travel.  Ambrose has a talent for capturing the feel of an extended Twilight Zone episode in each of his writings.  I specifically remember the Richard Long episode where he wakes up to find the world he knew changed.<br />In this novel, Rick Hamilton seems to have his life together; good job, family and friends.  His wife is then killed in a tragic car accident.  Unable to face the reality of her death, he is transported to a parallel universe where she is still alive but there are subtle differences in his life.  Mainly, he never had children (in his own reality, he has a son and his wife is pregnant with another), has a totally different job, and he is a lot more distant from the people that he knows.  He ends up sharing his existance with the Rick (called Richard) in that universe; inhabiting the same mind.  <br />Along the way Rick and Richard form an unusual alliance and each discovers something important about themselves.  I don't want to give too much more away, but I just want to say that I was able to read this book in one sitting.	2004-01-12

After all Richard Chamberlain had worked with many big names in Hollywood.  It was not as good as I thought.  One reason is that throughout the book Chamberlain seems to be embarrassed to just say what happened and seems to use innuendos rather than to intricately describe a lot of things that happened.<br />Also, he dated/accompanied many big name actresses/royalty.  You are expecting a lot of detailed observations about these times (for instance when he went out with Joan Crawford) and maybe some interesting antedotes but they are not there.<br />Even in his male/male relations Richard talks like a sheltered &quot;princess&quot; not really telling you anything &quot;juicy.&quot;  Also, there are several letters and poems that he includes that for the most part I found boring. Richard talks about living his life with the public's &quot;perfect&quot; image in mind instead of the way he wanted to based on his own feelings.  It seems like the way he wrote this book, he was too concerned about his image to present a no-holds barred account of himself.<br />The best parts of the book are when Richard describes a 17 day spiritual workshop he took and his work on the Shogun miniseries.  Both of these chapters are worth the whole book! In the workshop, Richard finally got the courage to face the world with his &quot;own&quot; desires.  The Shogun miniseries was full of problems during the production, mainly due to culteral difference between the Japanese and American culteral crews. <br />Chamberlain has experienced a very full life and I am sure if he tried he could redo this book and make it great.	2004-01-11

Four people spend a week at a haunted house for $100,000.  Similiarly, several years earlier four people did the same thing and three died and one was practically driven mad!  <br />Almost immediately upon arriving things start happening, some being very life-threatening.  When reading this book you wonder what is keeping the people from just getting the hell outta there (I know I would!).<br />We find out that the house was originally owned by a mad rich person that liked to have wild orgy-like parties that started moving into torture, murder, cannabalism and anything else you can think of (I wonder if Stanely Kubrick got the idea for his mansion in Eyes Wide Shut from this book?).  Because of all the evil and death that have occurred in the house, there is a lot of evil energy floating around that seems to be amplified by two of the guests (both mediums with very strong psychic abilities).<br />Some of the attacks on the guests turn out quite gruesome (one of the guests is viciously attacked by a possessed cat).  <br />Don't read this one when you're alone!	2004-01-07

This is the third Ambrose book I have read and all seem to be totally different in style.  This is probably the best one.  It seems to combine The Matrix with James Bond and some generic engineering.  You never know what is real and what is virtual reality.<br />Charlie Monk is a super agent recruited by the government to perform Bond-like tasks.  In some cases some of Charlie's actions seem like the work of a covert operation where the government may be eliminating witnesses, so we are not sure whether or not Charlie is a good guy or a bad guy.  <br />Also, Charlie seems to not really be able to remember his past (note: there is a quote in the front of the book from Sean Connery saying the same thing about the James Bond character not having any past prior to being a secret agent).  Addiitionally, there is a doctor forced to help the government in some experiments involving patients with no short term memory so you are not sure if Charlie was one of those patients or not.  Sometimes the author takes you along a different path and makes you think Charlie is something else.  (I will not say anymore along these lines because I do not want to spoil it for the reader).<br />The book never gets boring and there is plenty of action and psychological drama going on.  I practically finished this book in one sitting, it was that good!	2004-01-04

It seems like the author is trying to outdo the makers of the Die Hard movies.  <br />It just seems that wherever Schofield goes he is caught in the midst of corrupt military and competing corrupt foreign powers.  He escapes from one impossible situation after another, some of which are insults to the reader.<br />I would have rated this book lower but the three main characters are highly likable and the reader hopes that something may develop between Schofield and Gant.	2003-12-27

Little by little he seems to remember things.  The more he remembers he finds out that the life he thought he came from is a lie.<br />The author uses interesting story-telling in that some chapters follow the continuing story of Adam making a bicycle trek over a couple of days and encountering attack dogs, bullies, bad weather, and  a bike thief, while on the way to meet his father to give a gift.<br />The other chapters are either straight narrative as Adam remembers things and there are also question and answer sessions between Adam and the analysist that is interrogating him.<br />The varied writing style makes the book flow by pretty fast.  I was able to get through this one in a few hours.	2003-12-22

Being that these books came out about the same time, I wonder if the authors worked together to come up with their stories since they are so much alike.   The things that are the same include: old abandoned ice stations (different poles however), dangerous prehistoric creatures lurking around, undocumented military skirmishes between the US and other countries, combination scientists/military teams at the ice stations, battles that include air chases, a foreign warship ready to blow the place up, etc.<br />This book is ok (3 stars) but the Reilly book was far better (4 stars).	2003-12-12

It was so good I just couldn't put it down.  <br />I don't want to give a synopsis because the book is full of surprises right from the start and any detailed plot discussion would ruin it for the reader.  I will say that there are many interesting actually documented coincidences presented in the book.  Different characters narrate different sections of the book, which gives more than one perspective of events.  Also, there are a lot of coincidences that occur in the plot that turn out to be just that (coincidences, that is) and other situations where what we think is coincidence, was carefully orchestrated by one of the characters.<br />Prior to reading this book, I read Ambrose's \\"Superstition, which was also excellent and was written in a totally different style.  It looks like Mr. Ambrose is a highly talented writer with many varying ideas.	2003-12-05

Two of the children escape and those responsible for them must recapture them and kill anyone that the children come in contact with.<br />One of the children eludes capture and is befriended by a lady veterinarian and her companion, a former FBI agent.  Pretty soon they are on the lam to get away from the bad guys led by the sinister \\"Uncle Thomas.\\"<br />I enjoyed this book immensely and would have rated it higher if not for the ineptitude of the bad guys in their pursuit of the good guys.  They are highly efficient in eliminating all other people that they consider a threat but make too many obvious mistakes while hunting the good guys.	2003-12-05

King wrote an earlier book about a woman that was accidently chained to a bed in a log cabin (he's written so many that I forgot the name).  In it the woman struggles to survive and escape from her bonds.  While doing this she has time to examine her own life and realize a great deal about herself.  Well in this book, instead of a woman we have a girl (Trisha) and instead of being chained to a bed, she is lost in the woods.  While trying to survive and reach civilization, Trisha also examines her life and starts to realize a lot of things about herself.  While doing that she fantasizes about Tom Gordon, a relief pitcher for the Red Sox.  Sometimes she imagines seeing him and getting advice from his image.  I think because King is such a big Red Sox fan that he needed to put together something with the Red Sox.<br />The books tends to drag a little past the middle.  I might have rated this book a little higher had I not read the first book (which I thought was a lot better).	2003-11-25

I was a fan of Marvel Comics growing up and have passed on to my son quite a collection of comics.  I had read many of Stan's other works regarding comics (Origins of Marvel Comics, Sons of Origins, Bring On the Bad Guys).  Each of those books were excellent.  However, those books dealt with nothing prior to The Fantastic Four.<br />In this book we learn that Stan had a long career (about 20 years) in the comic book field, Marvel wasn't called Marvel until the 1960's, Stan used to churn out close to 80 titles a month in the 1950's, Stan actually wrote a few books in the 1950's that sold well, and Stan was actually going to quit the trade on the day he was told to create a superhero group (later called the Fantastic Four) for Atlas comics.  And those are just of few of tidbits that are contained in this wonderfully written bio/auto bio.	2003-11-19

I bought this book based on Amazon's recommendation and was greatly disappointed.  The first 50 pages are great then the book falls apart from there.  <br />We have a paleonologist presented first-hand with the opportunity to study live dinosaurs via time-travel.  We have interesting descriptions of time-travel possibilities and a mysterious &quot;older woman&quot; from the future that wants to have a romantic liaison with the paleontologist.  Then I don't know what happened to the story.  It seemed like there were too many boring characters introduced and I found myself not being able to remember who each of them was.<br />The book is compared to Jurassic Park.  Other than the live dinosaur angle, I don't know how to compare them as that had a far superior story that I enjoyed through and through.	2003-11-18

It centers around the discovery of a meteorite at the North Pole that contains, what appears to be, exterrestial life.  Just judging by the title of the book you can determine that there is a ruse going on.  And those that stumble onto the deception must be eliminated.<br />The action is fact-paced and the characters are extremely intriguing!  I especially liked the scientists when they are so into themselves as being right that they just discount anyone that questions their analyses. Additionally, like the title also implies, not all the characters are what you think they are!<br />I would have rated this higher except that some of the escapes/rescues got so unbelievable that they insulted the reader's intelligence.	2003-11-13

The Joad family epitomized the wave of mid-westerners that were exploited during the dustbowl years by large farm owners.  You feel for them and hang on their every hope and feel their agony as they are used by shysters, on the way to losing everything they have.  The tale is so gripping and heart-wrenching!

The author has an interesting take on the Cain & Abel story.  Basically, depending on which bible you read it has a different translation.  Depending on which you choose to accept, that is how you should lead your own life.<br />Great characters and impossible to put down.

It is very different than the first movie but a little bit like the remake.  The book certainly has a better story than either of those two films.<br />In this one, the space travelers clearly go to a different planet in another part of the galaxy.  They find a race of humans that have become dumb through laziness.  The apes had evolved from pets to far more intelligent.  However, Boulle makes them literally &quot;apes&quot; in that they can only mimic other things they have seen and thus have no original thoughts.<br />I would tend to disagree.  If the apes had gotten that far along, I am sure their brain center that controls creativity would have too.	2003-11-04

It is like a long episode of The Twilight Zone with a little Jack Finney (who the author repeatedly refers to) thrown in.  The book theorizes that most paranormal activity is created from the mind and can be explained by things like telekinesis and mass hypnosis.  Based on this a group of researchers believe that they can create a ghost.  They go about creating a history of their ghost along with sketches of what he looked like.  They are successful, however, something goes awry and what they unleash is pure evil and the reality they knew slowly begins to fade.  Great characters too!<br />A real page-turner!	2003-11-04

I am not big on stream-of-consciousness writing and enormous difficulty understanding and following what was happening in this book.  <br />I can see that the book has some good writing.  I am sure that the book is quite good if it is your style.  That is why I am still giving it 3 stars.  It is quite possible that this book is like an IQ test.

On the outside she gives the appearance of a contented spouse.  Internally, her mind is constantly on her secret lover and how she can be with him.  You really feel sorry for her husband, who is a man who idolizes the air that she breathes and takes great pleasure in just being behind her and admiring the fact that he is so close to her.  Emma, on the other hand, cringes when she thinks of him and only appears to be with him for the sake of her children.<br />While I was reading this I was hoping that Emma could catch a glimpse of what was going on in her husband's mind and just maybe, she would have felt a little more sympathy for him.  I am not sure whether Flaubert wants us to pity her or despise her.  I for one fall in the latter category and I felt so sorry for her husband.<br />This book still has a lot of relevance today and shows how two people that think they know each other, could be so wrong about what they think.	2003-10-30

This book is similar in plot to a Matthew Riley book (of which I have read 3) but written in a much better style that made this book very hard to put down.<br />The book starts with a Dominican priest being chased by very intent Incan warriors.  It is very important for the priest to get to sacred Incan location before they catch him so he can do something before he dies.  We then flash forward over 400 years to the mummified remains of the priest being discovered with a mysterious substance inside that melts at body temperature and cannot be frozen solid.  A group of modern day Dominican priests are after the substance that they call Sangre del Diablo (blood of the devil).

The group meets in secret in a secured room (why the inner sanctum of course!) to discuss the progress of the project and to decide what to do with things or people that might jeopardize the project.<br />The main character, Jesse, is a woman whose boss was killed when he suspected that there was a conspiracy going on to rig the upcoming senatorial election.  Jesse receives a posthumous email from her boss that tells her where she can find a folder with evidence about the conspiracy.  Through some magic or some whim of the author, we are led to believe that the system can fire off the email without leaving an audit trail of where it went to just because it left the company and was later delivered from an external address back to the company.  Doesn't the author know that most systems would have a copy of all incoming emails so it would be fairly simple to compare the outgoing message to all incomings to figure out the recipient.  <br />Some problems I have with the book.  First we have a methodic hit man who becomes a bumbling dolt when he has to go after Jesse.  Secondly, we are expected to like one of the main characters, David.  David is a stock trader who has very \\"dirty hands\\" and is highly involved in insider trading, performing [illegal] corporate transactions, possible money laundering, and hiding records of financial transactions.  We are expected to like him.  Thirdly, another main character, Todd, has been late in paying back the mob for his gambling debts.  They seem to go way to easy on him.<br />If you read this book, try not to judge Frey on it.  Just about everything else I read by Frey merits 4-5 stars.	2003-09-17

As a result any technology created after 1980 is rendered useless.  Additionally the radiation causes weather and other conditions that wipeout significant portions of South America and Asia.   Like the novel Lucifer's Hammer, the remainder focuses on specific survivors to the tragedy.  However, where Lucifer's Hammer had very intriguing characters and a fast-flowing exciting plot, this book lulls you to sleep for almost 300 pages until anything interesting happens.  <br />This is when group of Mars explorers attempt a very dangerous re-entry to the Earth's atmosphere.  On top of this a serial child killer and a leader of a fanatical cult are released from \\"judicial sleep.\\"  (This is a method of keeping the person asleep during their incarceration.   Persons with extremely long sentences would just sleep until they died).  The child killer just happens to be one of the few people still alive that can help some terminal cancer patients.   Yeah right!<br />The other main part of the story centers around the president and his inability to perform sexually and his problem with a former girlfriend.  I found it very hard to not just skip over these pages while I was reading them.	2003-08-20

It has some really interesting pages intermingled with a lot of boring ones that I found myself skimming over.<br />The book centers around a chess set once owned by Charlemagne and said to have some sort of magic power.  The set somehow ends up in the possession of the Montglane Church and hence, referred to as the Montglane service.  The heads of the church realize that its power can be used to promote evil intentions and thus, sequester the service within the Church walls.  There it remains for several centuries and its legend grows.  <br />With the outset of the French Revolution, some of the leaders of the revolution have a goal to confiscate the service to further their power.  The Abbess of the church is forewarned and has the service dug up and its pieces given to several of the nuns to hide in various parts of Europe.  The most prevalent of these nuns is a young woman named Mirelle (who really shouldn't have been a nun because of her feral life-style).  As Mirelle is set upon by the evil leaders of the revolution she starts to piece together the secret of the Montglane service.<br />The story interlays a separate tale of a young woman (Katherine) in the early 1980's who is sent on an assignment to Algiers to help start up OPEC.  Katherine is warned by a fortune teller about the dangers that lie ahead and also asked by a friend to try to obtain pieces of the Montglane service while in Algiers.  Along the way Katherine is dragged into a chess tournament where one of the player is murdered and Katherine is shot at.  She also seems to be involved in a huge game of intrigue with a Russian chess player who appears to be KGB, a mysterious recluse named Nim, a wealthy female chess player named Lily and another chess guru named Mordecai. <br />As Katherine embarks to Algiers she seems earmarked to follow a similar path that Mirelle had followed 200 years prior and be the one to re-unite all the parts of the Montglane service.<br />One of the reasons I didn't give this book a higher rating is that people are murdered around Katherine, yet nothing really happens to her even though everyone seems to know that she may play an important role in re-uniting the service.  I periodically play chess for fun but am not a student of vast strategies of the game.  The whole book seems to revolve around complex chess strategies, which should make the book extremely interesting for chess aficionados.  Additionally, Katherine's portions of the tale are told in first-person, which kills some of the mystery because you already know that she will survive all the dangers she faces.	2003-07-11

It was like expecting Raiders of the Lost Ark and getting Remo Williams instead.<br />This book is painfully slow and I found myself stuck on the first 200 pages.  The story of the Incas centers on the death of the current ruler.  He has not named a successor though his various sons are vieing for the privilege.  Just before his death the ruler had confided in a blue eyed girl who was stolen from another tribe.  After his death everyone wants to know what was said to her and whether the ruler named a successor.<br />Meanwhile in Spain, there is a kind of scoundrel named Gabriel who escapes the Inquisition and somehow ends up with Pizarro.  Pizarro tells of his gruelling trip to Peru and the gold that awaits there.  He is trying to get together an invading force to sail to the New World and exploit the gold.  All of this sounds way more interesting than the book actually is.  <br />The book is followed by two more but I think I'll stop at this one.  Read Jennings instead.  The story of Cortez's invasion of Mexico is way better!	2003-05-28

Don't let this book's size daunt you or the sometimes terribly boring parts at the beginning stop you.  Once you get past the first 250 pages or so we have a powerful book that will have your head spinning because it could happen!  The largest earthquake in recorded history hits the central of the country.  Thousands dead, millions homeless, and the nation's economy about to crumble.<br />The book has two very likable central characters.  Firstly there is Jason, a teenager from a broken home, whose mother dies in the earthquake and whose father doesn't really seem to care about him, even after finding out that Jason survived.  Jason floats a boat down the Mississippi (not quite like Huck Finn) and encounters Nick, a real kindhearted sort whose best friend gets gunned down by a deranged cop and who gets shot by the same cop and then has to do battle with a poisonous snake.  Nick and Jason form a strong bond that is far greater than Jason ever had from his family.<br />Meanwhile, there is a crazy evangelist, a KKK sheriff, and an Army general that are each coping with the disaster in different ways.  Though these characters are less interesting, they add important roles to the plot of the book.	2003-05-03

Upon further inspection, we find out that the sailboat is more than 10,000 years old though it still looks brand new.  Additionally, it is made from materials that will virtually never wear out.  Max Collingwood with the aid of April Cannon (a scientist) tries to determine from where the boat originated.  This leads to the discovery of a portal to other worlds.<br />This book raises interesting questions regarding technology.  Each time there is an advance, invariably there is an industry producing old technology that will be affected economically.  In this book, ancient relics are unearthed that have technology that is light years ahead of what currently exists; creating panic in several industries including transportation, clothing and tires.  Now the question.  Do we use the technology for all its benefits or do we destroy all evidence of the technology to preserve our existing economy and industries?  I would vote for the former rather than the latter because the latter is a selfish attitude with very short-term thinking.<br />Mankind must always make sacrifices in order to advance.  The author brilliantly illustrates that notion here in a book that you will zip through rather fast.	2003-04-10

Having been a huge fan of Robert Graves' I Claudius and Claudius the God, I was always sad that Graves did not write a sequel to highlight the reign of the last Augustan ruler.  Many times reading Quo Vadis, I felt like this was that book.  It does give a good insight to the decadence of Nero's reign along with some references to his predecessors.  It also clarified some often-misrepresented assumptions like all gladiatorial competitions taking place in the Colosseum.  We learn that Nero pre-dated the Colosseum and in fact, the battles were staged in a large \\"wooden\\" arena.<br />Some of the action has some good vivid descriptions such as the burning of Rome and some of the gladiatorial fights.  The book also gives a glimpse at what Christianity could have been.  We see how the disciples Peter and Paul worshipped their religion in a way that is totally unlike anything today.<br />The characters are excellent and the book never gets boring.	2003-03-29

That is not the case for this book from which the movie was made.  This non-fiction tale of Henry Hill, a soldier in one of the smaller New York crime families is very easy to follow as well as extremely difficult to put down once you start.  You actually develop a liking for the main character, who is way more passive then his two partners who kill without compunction or remorse.  Though none of them ever becomes a made man, they seem to be right on the cusp of a lot of big Mafia related events that happened in the 1970s and 80s.  Having read The Valachi Papers and Sammy Gravannos autobiography, I find this book the best of the bunch.	2003-03-21

Several of the characters that had minor roles in the movie, have much larger roles and are actually quite interesting in the book (ex. Johnny Fontaine, Moe Greene, Lucy).

The short read time is my only complaint about this extremely interesting and mind stimulating story.<br />It deals with very interesting and complex characters.  We have the two military couples, both of which have very bad marriages.  The first because the husband (the Major) just shuts out his sickly wife.  The second because the husband (the Captain) is an intellectual who seems to have married a fairly simple-minded woman whose only interests lie in material things and the carnal spirit.  The four of them are drawn together in a weird relationship where the Major is having an affair with the Captain's wife.  Both the Captain and the Major's wife know about the affair but seem to enjoy the get-togethers for Bridge and parties that the couples constantly happen together.<br />Meanwhile, the Captain's wife is being watched by a very strange enlisted man, who the Captain both hates and seems to be attracted to at the same time.  The enlisted man spends nights watching the Captain's house to get a glimpse of the Captain's wife.  Eventually, he starts to regularly enter the house to watch over the sleeping form of the Captain's wife.<br />The Major's wife seems to be worshipped by her Phillipino servant.  Her additional confidante is an army lieutenant who she knits sweaters for.<br />A great deal seems to be hinted at (ex. The sexuality of the Captain), but never fully explained, probably because most of the subject matter was considered very risque when the book was written.  I really wish this book could be written in an expanded form.  All the characters seemed very complex and the life and psyche of each could be greatly explored in a much larger book.<br />I also think there is a lot of fodder to foster some really good University discussions on each of the characters.  I wish we had explored this book when I was in college.	2003-03-19

Not much in the way of science fiction.  More along the lines of the fear of Communism that gripped the US post-WW II.  In the book other countries had the same idea as the US about the impending disaster and were also able to launch rockets to the new world before the Earth is destroyed.  The people from those rockets are not too \\"benevolent\\" and try to harness what they find left over from the earlier civilizations of the new planet to become masters of the planet.<br />We find that even though the prior races have long since perished, most of the machinery left behind still works.  If you bear in mind the period that the book was written you should find it a very entertaining read.	2003-03-13

I remember reading this book when it first came out and the stir it caused.  It was the first time an athlete pulled no punches and described what goes on in the locker room and off the field.  Bouton took a lot of heat and was blacklisted by many within MLB for his comments.  <br />The book is actually a diary of Bouton's comback season with the Seattle Pilots (they are now the Milwaukee Brewers).  They were an expansion team with a few big name washed-up stars.  Bouton, once a fireballer for the New York Yankees, hurt his arm and developed a knuckleball pitch to try to make it back to the bigs.  Throughout the book he talks about his outings (mostly in mop-up and other non-critical moments) and you feel his frustration at not being noticed for sometimes excellent pitching.<br />Not having seen many Pilot games in 1969, I am not sure whether Bouton was fantasizing his greatness with the knuckleball or he actually was the second coming of Hoyt Wilhelm.<br />Bouton's teammates are quite lovable and memorable, reminding me a lot of the characters from the movie Major Leagues.  There have been many books that came out since but this was the first of its type, and in my opinion the best!	2003-03-13

I ordered this book based on Amazon's recommendation believing it to be a scifi novel involving the fall of some galactic empire.  Little did I know how wrong I was.   Empire Falls is a place in Maine and the novel is a modern day story about everyday people with everyday problems.  I decided to give the book a chance and was very glad that I did.<br />The book focuses on Miles Robey, the proprietor a one of Empire Falls few restaurants.  Miles is a nice guy that throughout his life tried to please everybody.  As a result he \\"wasted\\" a college education and kept a job running a losing business. He also married a woman (who never made an effort to improve her relationship with him) who only cared about looking good and impressing other people.  Miles married her to avoid a romantic involvement with a crippled rich girl who was infatuated with him.<br />We meet several other interesting characters such as Miles daughter Tick (she reminds me a lot of Lisa from the Simpsons).  Tick is kind of an outcast in school, possibly because she is smart beyond her years.  <br />Then there is the mysterious Mrs. Whitting who owns half the town, and also Miles' restaurant.  Miles makes the observation that Mrs. Whitting seems to sell parts of her holdings always at the right time.  It seems to be Miles' fear of failure that prevents him from confronting her on obtaining a liquor license even though it would increase the business tremendously.<br />Miles' deceased mother was someone that had a good heart and a bad marriage.  She had great plans for Miles to make a better life for himself by getting out of the town.  She dies young from cancer and with her presence gone, Miles never a risk taker decides to continue to work at the restaurant rather than get out of the town to make a life for himself. Miles loves a waitress at the restaurant, who he has fawned over all his life.  However, he marries a woman that nobody seemed to be interested in because he was afraid of pursuing the woman he really wanted and failing.<br />We have Miles' obnoxious father who is basically a freeloader who only looks out for himself.  Then there is David who seems to be the only person in the book that thinks with some sense.<br />Empire Falls was a thriving town until the shifting economy caused the main factories to close.  The characters are basically, so ingrained in the town that no matter how bad things get you know they will always stay.<br />I am sure we all know many people with the same characteristics as these people and quite possibly we hold many of these characteristics ourselves.  That is what makes this book a very compelling read.	2003-03-04

Therefore each is a totally separate individual.  This is different than a split personality in which each personality is really a part of the total person.<br />The other assumption is that genes can inherit memories from ancestors and thus if someone in an individual's past was a concert pianist, the memory is there in the individual's genes.  Thus that individual can become a concert pianist.<br />A doctor who specializes in creating new personalities for people, takes advantage of this theory and is able to transform individuals into totally new individuals.<br />These theories are very interesting and are the only thing that keeps this book together.  The book itself is a mismosh of activities and events.  The author's descriptions often lack clarity where it is very difficult to picture what is happening and it is very difficult to follow the supporting characters.  Some seem to appear out of the blue and it seems that the author assumes you know something about them.<br />A lot of what happens is implausible and some of the ideas seem to be copied from the old tv series The Incredible Hulk.   (meek David Banner would turn into a super strong monster when he was enraged).<br />Maxim wrote a much better book dealing with the mind called \\"Time Out of Mind.\\"	2003-02-14

For those of you who want intricate special effects regarding time travel (ala Michael Crichton's Timeline), you will not find it here.  Instead we are provided a story with time travel elements that has well developed characters, good historical descriptions, and a great deal of suspense.<br />A student of history is sent back in time to England in the late Middle Ages.  Unknown to the student (by the name of Kivrin - what a great name!), the person who sent her back was infected with a virus.  The virus causes the technician's judgment to be off and he causes Kivrin to end up in the wrong time period.  The technician is so stricken by the virus, that he keeps lapsing in and out of consciousness before he can fully explain to anyone, what went wrong.  What's worse is that the virus is causing an epidemic throughout the university so nobody is really able to keep on top of monitoring Kivrin.<br />Meanwhile Kivrin has the same virus as the technician, which apparently not only makes her deathly ill, but also causes her internal translator to not function properly.  Thus she is unable to understand anyone and nobody is unable to understand her.  I will not give away anything about the time she is in except to say that it is a time where people suspected of being witches are burned.  Therefore if Kivrin appears to act strange, she could be in for a lot of trouble.<br />This book has a lot of good going for it.  Some things that detracted a little from the story are that the book is supposed to take place in the year 2040 but other than time travel, there is virtually nothing different from today.  I am not sure when the book was written but telephones described are very archaic even by today's standard.  Additionally, the way Kivrin is sent back in time and left in a great deal of danger does not sound like a \\"routine\\" activity that a university would be engaged in even 40 years into the future.	2002-11-20

The beings appear to be pure evil with only the purpose of killing, eating and enslaving surface dwellers.<br />An expedition is formed to explore the underground region and try to unravel the secrets of these beings.  The expedition is made up of a band of scientists, a nun, an escaped POW from the beings, and a bunch of military mercenaries.  The book is intriguing in that you want to learn the secrets of these beings and if they are really led by \\"Satan.\\"   All through the expedition, interesting things are found and there are some really compelling pages of plot (though they are scattered in various parts of the book).  On top of all this there is a renegade in the group looking for a way to destroy all underground life.<br />Now the bad points.  Firstly, the book was incredibly slow-moving and written in a style where I kept forgetting who the characters were.  I am claustrophobic and just thinking how far the travelers were underground constantly bothered me.  It is never explained how they get air.  Also, they are dropped supply containers from the surface.  I was never really clear how they could be transported from the surface to where the travelers were supposed to be.   I truly did not understand how some of the \\"mutants\\" became the way they were and could not actually picture how they looked.  The main mutant is named Ike and he is supposedly pretty repulsive looking with glyphs and tattoos over all his body.  You can not understand why the main female character, who is also a nun, would be attracted to him physically.  Some of their physical interactions left me very uncomfortable.<br />This is one book with good points and bad points that you can't really help read to the end because even though it is a difficult read, you definitely want to find out what will happen in the end.	2002-10-29

Some he can help while others are impossible to help.  So begins his journey to try to escape Hell.<br />This was such a well written interesting short novel.  Very philosophical in nature.  The authors give a new slant on explaining the reason for Hell and how to get out of it.  I will not give away the surprise ending but it really came as a surprise and did work well.	2002-10-10

The cemetary has a curse on it and things buried there seem (the family dog) seem to come back to life.  All through the first half of the book we keep being shown large Orono fuel trucks whizzing past the front of the house.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that someone in the family will be hit by one of those trucks and then get buried in the cemetary to be brought back to life.<br />Did I say predictable?  Well not to give away the ending, I will just say that you can see it coming a mile away.  <br />I think that this is one of the books King was cranking out when he was also doing movies.  Most of that work was his poorer efforts.<br />Don't get me wrong, I think King has had some phenominal efforts, such as The Stand, Misery, The Long Walk and something about Rita Hayworth (they made the movie The Shawshank Redemption based on it).	2002-10-10

Scary because it is something that could happen in real life.  A famous writer (Paul) of women's romance novels is injured in a car accident and kidnapped by a crazed fan (Annie).  Annie will let Paul go on the condition that he resurrerect a popular character (Misery) that he killed off in one of his novels.<br />Sounds easy, except that Paul must make it totally convincing (not just a dream like Bobby Ewing) or he will suffer excrutiating consequences.   Annie makes for one of the most horrifying jailers.  Someone that is very demanding and will go off the deep end for any little thing.<br />Loved this book through and through.  One possible drawback to some readers may be that King presents many pages from the Misery transcript that Paul was prepares.  If you are not a romance novel fan you could find those parts boring.  I rather liked them.	2002-10-10

Though there is a lot of scientific inaccuracies, what makes this book great are the characters.  If you liked Stephen King's The Stand which also had great characters, then you should like this one.  <br />The main character is Ish.  Ish seems to be someone that we all strive to be.  Caring and smart.  Ish also, has the son that we all wish our children would be like.  Ish's son is the smartest of all the children and he simply idolizes Ish.<br />Ish uses a hammer (a basic, I guess Stanely model) as his symbol of power (or his sceptre) over the survivors.  Undoubtedly, the hammer is to pass to Ish's son when Ish dies.  <br />The big project for the survivors is to get an old automobilie repaired enough to explore other lands and try to find other bands of survivors and get civilization back on its feet.  I don't want to give the rest of the plot away only to say that this project turns out to be a big mistake.	2002-10-10

Before reading this book, you should read Earth Abides.  That book is similar in that it deals with a band of survivors after a world holocaust.  That book had great characters and interesting plot.  This book goes way beyond and has a long laundry list of interesting and memorable characters (laws yes!).  <br />Don't be intimidated by the sheer size of the book.  The book wastes no page and even people that get wiped out at the beginning of the book from the super virus, are interesting.  I never zipped through of book this large so fast.<br />This book has the ultimate showdown between good and evil that had me cheering out loud even though I was reading the book on a crowded subway train and getting strange stares!	2002-10-10

I read this book along with Atlas Shrugged and found them both to be some of the most powerful reading I had ever experienced.  Ms. Rand was a phenominal story-teller providing so many interesting characters overcoming impossible odds to show that individuality is preferrable to collectivism.<br />This book uses architecture as the basis.  Anyone deviating from the accepted architectural styles is scorned even if their buildings will be environmentally smart and economical.<br />Even if one doesn't care for the politics there is so much fascinating detail on how all the beautiful old buildings in New York City were designed.	2002-10-08

It centers around someone that just \\"loses it\\" in a case of road rage.  After knowingly kills somebody and calms down he must decide what to do.  Does he turn himself in and repent or does he cover his tracks?  Of course he picks the latter course which means he must then become a vicious criminal to cover all bases.<br />This book goes to show that no matter what the situation you should not let your rage get the better of you.  Otherwise you can go from law-abiding citizan to vicious animal.<br />There are some parts that I did have problems with such as some of the criminal talents that the main character was able to come up with out of nowhere.  Also, there is one of those parts, reminicent of the movies where a guy will put a snake in a house to kill all the house occupants.  Most animals of that type do not go hunting for humans and only strike when threatened or cornered.  However, directors try to take poetic license and change the animal's nature to suit the film.	2002-10-07

It looked right up my alley; a psychiatrist with a patient that seemed to live many past lives.  On top of it all, the psychiatrist was supposed to be Carl Jung, a major pioneer in the field.  The problem for me occured almost immediately from the first page.  The story seemed to be written in a \\"painfully\\" boring manner.   The Pilgrim, a man who cannot die, has just survived hanging himself.  He doesn't talk.  Carl Jung is assigned his case and tries to draw him out.  Sounds exciting?  It should have been but I just could not get into it.  I think it was just the author's style of writing.<br />I tried over and over to finish this book but I never could go more than halfway.   And I am usually the type of person that must finish a book no matter what.  I see most of the reviews here were pretty good so it may just be a case of the writers particular style and my brain being incompatible.	2002-10-04

Prior to reading this book I read Walt Becker's Link which presents a lot of the same information about ancient wonders (Stonehedge, the Pyramids, etc.).  That book was also similar in telling the tale of man's creation.  Like that book, my main problem was distinguishing between what is fact and fiction about the ancient ruins.  Both books needed some sort of appendix explaining what was fact.  <br />However, this is still a well written, hard to put down tale about the approaching foretold day of the world's destruction.  (Link was also great but took the tale in a different direction). One man has spent his whole life trying to solve the riddle of the ancient wonders and find a clue to prevent the coming castastrophy.  Only problem is, that he is in a mental institution and considered very dangerous.  Is he really a raving loony or man's only hope for salvation?  I think the reader can guess the answer to that question beforehand.  Still a great read!	2002-10-04

This book opened up my eyes to what our society is like!  Since I read it I can no longer stomach looking at some of the sick looking models that do jean commercials.  Why would anyone look like that?  What about some of the really beautiful larger women?  Someone like Camryn Manheim?  How come they never do those commercials.<br />I happen to be a workout fanatic and eat and exercise to feel good.  Looking good should not be starving oneself and have a frame that looks like it will snap in two.<br />I admire women of all shapes and sizes.  A pretty face and shapely body (not a pencil thin one)is what I like in looks.  Usually, a warm and cheerful personality makes the face beautiful (not tons of make-up).  People need to stop falling for advertising by people that are trying to sell you a false bill of goods.<br />Bravo Mr. Mayer!	2002-10-04

Everyone is trying to be the first to reach it from the US Military to terrorist groups to German special police.  The reason: the idol is made from a meteorite that can provide the source of power for an ultimate weapon.  An ancient manuscript is the key to finding the location of the idol.<br />This book has a lot more good points.  When the main character is reading the ancient manuscript the story is excellant.  The rest of the book is a mismash of Indiana Jones meets Die Hard.  Additionally, the author throws in a pack of ancient mythical beasts that seem to never have their appetites satiated.<br />Some of the suspense is really good.  What I didn't like is that an ordinary guy is thrown into the mix and he does impossible things.  Like guess a virtually impossible password in seconds and defeat trained terrorists with ease.  Also, he has a few impossible escapes.  Still there is enough in the book to make it worthy of a read.  The \\"flashbacks' to the Incan era are worth reading just by themselves.	2002-09-24

The book is fast paced and suspenseful with very intriguing characters.<br />The story centers around LuAnn Tyler, a poor desparate woman who is caught in a situation from which there is no escape. Enter a mysterious man by the name of Jackson who offers a way out of her troubles that all of us wish could happen to us. That is, to be assurred of buy the winning ticket in a 100 million dollar lottery. LuAnn is reluctant to do this because she feels it is too \\"dishonest.\\" Yeah right!<br />Anyway her situation keeps gets to the point where taking Jackson's offer is the only choice. LuAnn retires with the money and disappears for 10 years as to the agreement with Jackson. The story should end there but lo and behold, LuAnn decides to disobey Jackson's orders to disaappear. Of course Jackson is the one person on the planet whose orders you never disobey. Such is the setup for a nail bitting fast-paced tale.<br />I would have rated this book slightly higher but I feel the author went way overboard in portraying Jackson's abilities. He would have us believe that Jackson could make-up himself to passably look like any individual, male or female and also be able to talk like the person. Some of Jackson's abilities and resources go way beyond what even Bruce Wayne (Batman) had.	2002-09-12

He is raised by a Fray (a friar) and taught to read and write, which is forbidden to all but Spaniards.  It seems like everyone he meets wants to kill him.  The reader can only suspect why, until the late in the book.<br />The book does have some elements of the prior two and that is explaining some of the ancient rituals of human sacrifice and the horrors wraught by the Spanish Inquisition.<br />There are some interesting characters too (Mateo, Sanchez, the Healer), but in camparison to some of Mr. Jennings other books they are just not as good.<br />I understand that this book was completed by a ghost writer after Mr. Jennings untimely death.

Cliff would then rush to his office to see what the hacker was doing.<br />Some of the techniques employed involve one of the earliest versions of a \\"password cracker.\\"  Cliff goes from one police agency to another (from the FBI to the NSA), with evidence of the various computers the hacker is going into.  Each one tells him it is great what he is doing but they have no jurisdiction to do anything.  It is a wonder that the hacker is ever caught in the end.<br />A little outdated by today's standards but still a very entertaining read!	2002-05-31

I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a fast moving tale with a lot action.  Smith seems to be a master at describing fight scenes (though some of the gore described goes a little overboard).<br />The tale centers around the sons of Hal Courtney.  Each one has chosen a different path in life.  One is kidnapped by pirates, which is followed by a massive search by the one Courtney that truly loves him like a brother.  The tension mounts every time young Courtney is close to rescue.<br />Great for fans of &quot;high seas&quot; action.	2002-05-31

It centers around the building of a church in the late middle ages.  A noble priest goes to great lengths to get it built.  The book also introduces one of the most evil and ubiquitious villians as the sheriff who is constantly ruining everything.  The action never stops.

They stop at nothing to ruin those that stand in their way.  In both novels we have the person who played by the rules to only get knocked down to the depths but ultimately triumph in the end.<br />This book gives a great feel for London in the late 1800's.  Follett's descriptions are so detailed that we can virtually smell the London fog.  The character development is also amazing.  A great read overall!	2002-05-22

Kevin Poulsen typifies the avid computer thrill seeker!  He was a very resourceful and ingenious individual who loved to get into computer systems for the challenge.  The book goes into explicit detail as to how Poulsen gets into various systems.

In some cases it is true and he exposes security weaknesses that are then corrected.  However, he does not know where to draw the line and starts listening in on FBI wire taps and running escort services.<br />In some cases the author takes liberty to assume that the reader understands specifics about the phone company and certain technologies and the book in those instances is hard to understand.

This one seemed to tie up all loose ends (unlike to culmination of Arthur C. Clarke's Rama series).  All through the book I was anxious for the return to Earth, to see what really had transpired.  Various characters throughout the series had said things like \\"why would you want to go there, everyone knows it's radioactive?\\"  Well I for one refused to believe it.  I loved the way that the one behind everything to do with the Foundation was not Hari Seldon as we thought but none other than Daneel.  The reasons for all that he did were fascinating.<br />My only regret is that Mr. Asimov decided to work on unnecessary pre-quels to the Foundation story rather than start a new series that takes place after this book.  Perhaps some of the brilliant scifi writers that have been successful capturing Mar. Asimov's style in other Foundation and Robot spin-offs, may be able to complete the task.	2002-05-20

This book has it all from intrigue, interesting characters, great pace, storyline and yes a whole lot of history. This book is the ultimate revenge of the nerd story. Claudius considered a buffoon and taken advantage his whole life, has the last laugh in the end when he is made emperor of the mightiest nation on Earth!<br />Claudius, born with some physical deformities that hamper his walking, make his mouth dribble at times, and to constantly stutter is considered to be an idiot by most. With Graves telling in the first person we see that Claudius is in fact a great intellectual with amazing insight into the world. He deals with so many interesting personalities (Livia, Tiberius, Caligula, and Herod to name a few). He is used badly by the evil ones and he watches as one-by-one the good ones meet very untimely deaths.<br />Claudius meets with someone wise to the ways of the empire who gives Claudius the best advice, which is that as long as the power seeker feel Claudius is no threat they will keep him alive. Therefore, Claudius should exagerate his informaties and make those evil doers feel he is dumber than they think and therefore no threat. This ultimately keeps him alive and after Rome has gone through two of the most corrupt Emperors of all-time (Caligula and Tiberius), Rome is eager to have an emperor who can be controlled easily and thus, the job of emperor is thrust upon Claudius. Claudius has his own ideas though and that includes restoring Rome to a Republic. But that is left for the sequel book which I highly recommend too.<br />I have read this book three times and it never gets boring.	2002-05-17

The depth and insight that the author provides is beyond comprehension. We find out why the National League was the superior league for many years. We also learn that the Yankees could have been far greater than they actually were (they could have signed Willie Mays and Hank Aaron to name a few greats) if not for their own predjudice.<br />We get a great insight to the personalities of baseball legends (Bob Gibson and Lou Brock were fascinating). On top of everything one of the most exciting World Series unfolds. The author's depictions are so vivid, I felt I was the catcher for Whitey Ford or Bob Gibson instead of just a reader of a book. On top of that, even knowing the outcome I felt the tension of a real game as the story was being told.<br />If you only read one baseball book, this one should be it!	2002-05-10

The meteor weighs several times more than any known element on Earth and gives off deadly electrical currents at times for no apparent reason.<br />You wonder just how the giant rock can be moved, much less lifted, and brought to a ship.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  The ending seemed to pave the way for a sequel.  The authors already had done a sequel to a previous work (Relic), so I am sure one is on the way.

Though I think that the world would be a lot worse off in reality, I respect Mssrs. Clarke and Baxter for their optimistic viewpoint.<br />As always with any book associated with Clarke, the technology is presented with a lot of detail and is new and exciting.  Clarke and Baxter also take a large dare and present \\"their\\" truth about many famous historical figures and tear down a lot of what they consider myth.  I enjoyed the book a great deal and might have given five stars.  However, I found the plot difficult to understand in parts of the book and was let down by the ultimate end.  Had not Mr. Clarke been so old and from what I hear in not the best of health, I would assume a sequel would be on the way.

These monuments appear indestructible and wreck destruction where they land.  Suddenly the world faces the inevitability of bleak future ruled by an unknown an evil presence that calls itself \\"Kuin.\\" <br />Turmoil erupts, and cults calling themselves Kuinists start springing up.  In the meantime a small group of government scientists start studying the monuments (chronoliths), to discover if they can be prevented from appearing or at least destroyed.  They know they have less than 20 years to solve the riddle or the future will be as the chronoliths proclaim.<br />This is the backdrop behind the book, which principally deals with a man (Scotty), who by chance gets drawn into working with the scientists, mainly because he was present when the first chronolith appeared.  Scotty must deal with abandoning his baby daughter when she was most in need and his own poor marriage collapsing.  He carries a great deal of guilt with him for many years.  Then when his daughter is whisked away by a Kuinist cult, Scotty goes to a support group where he meets Ashley, a woman whose son was also [lured] into the Kuinist cult.  With Ashley, Scotty reinvents his life.  Ashley is a woman in great need.   Unlike with Scotty's first wife, Scotty is there for Ashley to help her get through difficult times.<br />This book has limited science fiction in it and is more political in nature.  Being a big science fiction buff, I was a little bit let down by that.  There is also a big climatic scene toward the end of the book where I felt the author's descriptions were lacking, which made it difficult for me to picture accurately what was occurring.<br />Not wanting to give anything away about the ending, I will only say that the book is in great need of a sequel.	2002-04-09

This book takes the book \\"Chariots of the Gods?\\" to a new level and uses a fictionalized plot to explain most of the mysteries of that book.  There is a lot of information presented here which makes us question if the theories of evolution and the creation of life are correct.  In a archeological dig, some artifacts are discovered of such immense importance that a former archeologist turned college professor (Jack) walks out of the middle of his class to board a helicopter that will take him on a wild adventure.  Jack rushes to the site in Mali and examines what looks to be artifacts of an \\"alien\\" race.<br />One of the artifacts has strange powers and gives Jack enough information to know that all the secrets it possesses can be found in an ancient temple's ruins in Bolivia.  The only problem, he needs to be there at the next equinox which is just days away.  Jack and the other scientists race to the site.  When they get there they discover the secrets to man's creation along with a power source that can be man's salvation or can lead to man's destruction.<br />A corrupt businessman (Dorn) who deals in arms sales to foreign nations is funding Jack's venture using a drug cartel for transportation and equipment.   One can easily guess Dorn's motives right away and they are nowhere near benevolent.  Knowing that we can also guess up front that Dorn will stop at nothing to have the secrets of the ancient ruins for his own personal gain.<br />The book moves at a fairly rapid pace with the scientists, the drug cartel, Dorn, and the CIA all competing for the secrets.  It is definitely worth a read though not as good a book as Robin Cook's \\"Abduction,\\" which takes a different slant on explaining man's origins.<br />One thing definitely missing from this book is an appendix to explain what is actual fact and what is not.  Throughout the book the Jack talks about ruins that have features (such as one with aluminum between the stones) that could never have been produced in ancient times with the available technology.  Jack also refers to several biblical and other religious texts for other unexplained mysteries.  I was not sure any of these are actually in the quoted sources as I had never heard of them before reading this book.	2002-03-28

This book fall into that category.  Granted the original classic left a few loose ends, such as how did Simon and Julia escape the clutches of Julia's estranged fiancée?  And if Simon and Julia ended up getting married? The first question is still not answered though we see the second is.  Getting beyond that the book is boring and lacks the interesting characters and intriguing plot that the first book so rightly produced.<br />Ruben Prien is able to reverse the interference that Si produced at the end of the first book to restore the present to what it was.  The Project however, ran out of funding and was shut down.   Si takes a trip back to the present out of curiosity and meets up with Rube again.  Rube presents him with a lame argument as to why World War I needs to be prevented.  Si accepts the assignment and goes back to 1912.  <br />While in 1912 there are several chapters where Si goes around taking photos (which the author includes in the book).  This style worked brilliantly in the first book, while here it seems like it was forced.  The photos add nothing to the story or in enabling the reader to get a better flavor of 1912 New York.<br />Si then goes about trying to locate a man that Rube only knew as \\"Z.\\"  Z was working on some sort of European pact but disappeared shortly thereafter.  Rube felt that had Z not disappeared, the pact would have been in place thus preventing the War.  Si's 1912 associates turn out to be dull (the main one is a woman that Si calls the Jotta Girl).  When Si finally figures out who Z is, it turns out that Z is just as dull as the other lifeless characters in this book.<br />I found myself skimming over several chapters of the book.  One of these chapters explains an entire play that Si attends.  What bearing it had on the story, I had no clue.<br />Towards the end of the book Rube sends Si back on another try to stop World War I by letting Si know that his own son will be killed in the war.  I would have felt it a lot easier for Si to just try to save his son directly and not try to change the course of world events.  Someone as intelligent as Si, should have come up with the same conclusion.	2002-03-18

She receives a present of a strange mirror.  The mirror has powers and shows strange things.  The mirror causes the girl to switch bodies with her grandmother, transporting her soul back in time about 70 years to her grandmother's 20 year old body.<br />Anyone who had read Michael Moorcock's &quot;Behold the Man&quot; or has seen the Twilight Zone episode where an Elvis impersonator goes back in time to look for Elvis can guess what happens next.  Mainly the young girl is forced to live out the life of the grandmother based on what she knows about the grandmother and thus creating the grandmother.  What makes this book so good is that it returns to the present and we see the grandmother living out her life in the body of the granddaughter.  The author does a marvelous job of showing us the present time through the eyes of someone from the past.  It makes us want to re-examine our own lives for wonders we took for granted.	2002-03-04

I found myself stopping at the end of a chapter but being so intrigued that I needed to look ahead to the next chapter.<br />The only distraction is that the book is written in first person.  When dealing with thriller type fiction I usually don't like this technique because you know right up front that the storyteller is not going to die so some of the suspense is lost.  <br />I recently read another Kennedy book called \\"The Big Picture.\\"  As much as I liked that one, I think this book is superior overall.	2002-02-04

Most of the book is quite interesting with a lot of scientific detail.  It focuses on a virtually unexplored area of Kenya that has remained untouched since before the Stone Age.  This area has primitive man in different stages of genetic development.  The main character is forced to live with the \\"gracile\\" version of these primitive humans.  There is also a group far more primitive called \\"robusts.\\"<br />The book also has a battle between paleontologists and their varying ideas as to what should happen to these \\"protohumans.\\"  The main character, Ken Lauder, wants to study them and learn.  His rival, Cyril Anderson, wants to exploit them to make a name for himself.  Then we have I.V. Haskar, who knew of the existence of the protohumans for many years and feared what they mean to civilization so he kept their existence a secret.<br />What detracted from the book for me was the civil unrest and virtual revolution happening in Kenya at the time.  This would have made for an interesting book on its own but in this novel, I felt a lot of it to be boring and detracting to the story as a whole.<br />The story also focuses on Ken's relationship with a Kenyan woman named Yinka.  For some reason Ken is a source of fascination for Yinka but I never really understood why.  It seemed like their relationship may have been the author's fantasy.<br />The biggest relationship in the book is the father/son relationship that develops between Ken and a young protohuman he names Long Toes.  Through gestures and sounds, they are able to communicate in a way that is truly fascinating.  They develop a strong bond battling a lion, that is one of the best pieces of writing that I have ever read.<br />All in all I truly liked this book and found it superior to another novel about protohumans that I also enjoyed called \\"Neanderthal.\\"	2002-01-24

Enter Hannah, a reporter that gets thrown together with Grand when some highway workers are killed.  You expect a romance to develop between them but their relationship throughout the book seems awkward.<br />Meanwhile the sabertooths ruthlessly maul anyone they come across.

Though Cole is a stock broker, very little of the story involves investing as Freys The Takeover and The Vulture Fund.<br />As the story unfolds we find that Cole is a loner who did not know his mother and barely had anything to do with his father, while he was raised by his aunt and uncle.  He is an interesting personality and during the course of the novel he is paired with the pure Nicky from his hometown and Tori, who had a similar upbringing as Cole.  Tori is the more interesting of the two as her goal is to make her mother notice her for who she is.  This means that she must do things on her own and win acclaim on her own merit.<br />We also have Bennett Smith, who seems to get to the right place at the right time to get Cole out of jams.  As the book unfolds, Smith seems to be the most interesting character.<br />The books main credo throughout seems to be trust no one.  The book is definitely one to take with you for that long plane ride.	2001-09-26

What hurt this book a lot was that Crichton decided to emphasize and amount of time available for the characters to complete their mission and return.  Without completing the book you could easily guess that it would go down to the last second (at least in the movie \\"Goldfinger\\" the clock wound down to 007).<br />Quantum physics is the focus of the book and its many possibilities.  These include parallel universes, time travel and subatomic computers.  Crichton indicates that several companies are already involved in a great deal of R&amp;D in these fields.<br />The story focuses on a group of archeologists being sent back in time to rescue a colleague in 14th century England.  He had gone back there to the same site at which he was digging at in the present and not returned.  He had then left a message in a bunch of parchments that he knew his colleagues would find in the present.  <br />The group of rescuers includes Professor Mare, who always thought himself to be a knight.   Mare seems quite at home in the past and one can easily predict what his fate will be.  There is Chris, who is a wimpy professor who becomes a \\"man\\" but going back and being forced to live in a cruel and menacing era.  Kate is the mandatory lady that needs rescuing in this tale though at various points she seems to hold her own.  Two \\"security\\" types get bumped off rapidly (a la Star Trek) round out the cast.<br />Back in the lab in the present is Stern the scientist who comes up with the idea a \\"band-aid\\" approach to repair the technology that failed in the nick of time.  Donniger the head of the project who is similar to some of the project heads in other Crichton books (Jurassic Park).<br />The book did have its suspenseful moments (the inept Chris having to face a knight in a jousting match) but as one reads you can many times guess the outcome.  The cruelty and complete disregard for human life took all the glamour out ofwhat we expect knight tales to be.  <br />This book is definitely not a page-turner but there is enough history and science to make it worth a read.	2001-09-14
US	50909980	RTGDWWVFOR5EB	0312967098	129830098	Survivor	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Don't Miss This One!	Having recently enjoyed the movie \\"Castaway,\\" I was a little skeptical that this book would be almost a rehash.  Of this I was totally wrong.  Mark Llewellyn, a  middle age couch potato is thrust back in time about 1800 years.  It takes him several days to realize this and he wanders around looking for a way back to civilization.  It doesn't take long for he preservation instincts to kick in to the point where he is putting his hand in the carcass of dead animals to eat some of the innards.<br />He stays away from the people he encounters, fearing that any encounter would cost him his life.  He finally meets an old man living on a mountainside.  The old man allows him to stay but makes him do grueling work.  They go on hunts together and little by little they get to trust each other.  Though Mark is virtually useless in most things, he tries, with crude materials to introduce some of the later inventions to the old man.  <br />The rest of the book is great too and I don't want to spoil it by giving away too much.  When you get to the last twenty pages you wonder how the author will resolve everything with so few pages left, but he does a wonderful job of it.	2001-08-02

The premise is not new but it is told in a different way.  A universe where man has not developed and nature still controls.  Species that are extinct by man in our world, roam freely in the \\"wildside.\\"  A group of young people realize that a fortune can be made by finding a world's full of gold.  They finance their venture by selling \\"extinct\\" passenger pigeons to zoos.  The government eventually learns about their gate to the wildside and a renegade CIA operative tries to wrest control of the gate through an illegal covert action.<br />Though most of the book seems to slug along, it has a phenomenal ending.  The tale is told in \\"first-person,\\" a style which I am not too crazy about by Charlie Newell.  Throughout the book we only learn snitches about Charlie and what makes him tick.  Some of his friends (Maria, the Vietnamese girl and Joey particularly) are hardly developed at all.<br />Gould's book \\"Jumper\\" was far superior to this one (I gave that one five stars).  In that book as well as this one, the main character has a very poor relationship with his father, which leads me to believe that Gould's childhood may not have been the happiest.	2001-07-17

Jeff Winston dies and then goes back in time to relive his last 25 years but with all his memories intact.  Winston does all the things I would do if I were him.  That is; bet on sporting events which I already know the outcome and play the stockmarket for stocks that I already know made a fortune.  With his overall confidence he easily woos the women.  However, the same confidence and inflated ego proves to be a turnoff to the woman who was originally his wife.  Everything Winston does, can not prevent him from dieing again from the same heart attack on the same day and then being reborn again.  He then has another chance to make new choices in the same lifetime.<br />The idea for this book seems to have been copied by the movie Ground Hog day, but that was a more comical version and certainly did not cover the depth of the human soul that this book has.  In Winston's first go-around he fathers a daughter whom he adores to no end.  His soul is virtually ripped apart that he realizes that when he is reborn, his daughter's existance is literally wiped out.<br />In one of Winston's lives he decides to stick it out and go through 4 years of College again.  I am sure that most people in their 40's would be terrified of having to put in the mental effort involved in going through 4 years of things they have already learned and forgotten, especially knowing that some subjects will be worthless to their life's endeavors.<br />Winston has to decide with each life whether or not he wishes to start over in relationships with women he already had long relationships with.  <br />The author has done a marvelous job of having Winston do his own self-analysis.  As a reader we cannot decide if Winston is blessed or cursed.<br />Once you get through the first 25 pages of this book it is virtually impossible to put down.  I am very surprised that it is not already a movie.  I highly recommend that you don't miss this one!	2001-06-08
US	50909980	R2GHUZTZC7FKIO	0449210928	544373078	Texas	Books	5	5	6	N	N	The Definitive Texas Book	I have read most of Michener's works and this rates up with the best of them.  The characters are so interesting (ex. Otto McNabb, Benito Garza, General Quimper)  and it is amazing how Michener can blend them with the historical personalities so convincingly.  I found myself checking the fact section constantly to ensure myself as to who was real.<br />So many part of the book were so vivid that I felt I was there (ex.  the Plaza in Saltillo where the young people walk in circles with their chaperones).<br />I was happy that Michener did not overplay the action at the Alamo.  I have read so many books that have hundreds of pages devoted to describing the action.  Michener gave just enough detail that I could picture the battle as it unfolded and the events surrounding it (ex.  Bonham riding around Texas trying to get support for the doomed men).<br />The battles of Goliad and San Jacinto were perfectly depicted.  Many philisophical problems were brought to light during the book (eg. Mexican and Catholic culture vs. Anglo/non-Catholic) in very interesting ways that made this book hard to put down.  The book was over 1300 pages yet from the start the reader is never daunted by the size as it never gets boring.  Well worth getting this one if you see one in good condition at a garage sale.	2001-04-13
US	50909980	RRMWQUE902FEB	055357230X	538869946	The Clinic (Alex Delaware Novels)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not enough action	The book starts with murder of of psychologist/talkshow host/author/college professor named Hope Devane.  The murder is already old news and the original investigators lost interest.  Enter Milos Sturgis and Alex Delaware.  Milos and Alex explore different angles ranging from Hope's controversial talk show to her book to a university disiplinary committee she worked on.  As the plot moves ahead, two other murders are tied to Hope's and we have connections to a seedy lady's clinic.  Some of the biggest clues to solving this case come from Hope's long forgotten childhood.<br />The book does have some interesting moments.  The harvesting of body parts from unsuspecting victims bein one of those moments.<br />I found very little empathy for Hope or any of the victims of the novel.  I found the pace of the book to be excrutiatingly slow.  All along I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing exciting ever does.  The book also seemed to end leaving a lot of loose ends behind.	2001-02-21

I had never heard of it, but was intrigued by the description on the back cover.  The book deals with everything from Cryogenetics to cloning to global warming, to behavior modification.  Though the book was written in 1970, it was hard for me to find anything in it not relevent today.  It is amazing that it is not spoken of in the science fiction community these days.<br />The book centers around Stephen Walker.  He works for a company called Foxcroft who uses cryogenetics to freeze terminally ill patients (and also volunteers) until a cure is available for their disease.  Walker finds himself frozen for 500 years.  During that time science has made incredible leaps, society as he has known it has totally changed, and the goals and objectives of Foxcroft have totally changed.<br />Walker rejects most attempts by Foxcroft to physically and mentally alter him and clings to old traditions.  However, Foxcroft no longer follows the antiquated principals that Walker holds so dear.  Walker is placed in a situation where he must be conformed willingly or be transformed against his will.<br />I do not want to give too much more information because it would spoil the plot.  The book is written is a sequential fashion as Walker learns more about his world.  Therefore, the reader tends to figure out what is going on in the new age as Walker gradually learns.<br />This book could easily be made to film and should be as good as The Matrix.  The Amazon web site shows that there is a year 2000 version of this book now available.  I highly recommend that it be gotten.	2001-01-12

Sebastian Cant is a patient in an isolated medical facility.  He is given beautiful women to take care of his loneliness and pills that relieve all his pains and worries.<br />He meets every day with a psychiatrist.  As the story progresses, Sebastian learns he had committed some dastardly crime and was then brought to the facility to have knowledge of the crime, and his reasons for doing bad things &quot;erased&quot; from his mind in an effort to make him a model citizan.  This &quot;cure&quot; has also robbed him of a great deal of his life's  memories.<br />The facility turns out to be more than a hospitial.  Everyone there is a prisoner with all their actions and conversations monitored.  Persons that accidently straggle into the facility are &quot;taken care of.&quot;  That is all I will to say about the plot without spoiling the ending.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely.  It raises the question whether one's personal freedom is more important than having a life of bliss.  Should one rebel and try to escape or just not ask questions and go with the flow.<br />It also raises the question as to whether mind conditioning for criminals (also like A Clockwork Orange) is a viable alternative to general incarceration.<br />Amazon show that this book is out of print.  I would recommend looking for this one from a library, garage sale, or rare book seller.	2000-12-15

Maxim does an excellent job of bringing historical characters to life.  From the coniving Jay Gould to the gung ho Teddy Roosevelt.  With very rich descriptions of late 1800's New York City. <br />From the start we cannot figure out if John Corbin is one person, two people, or many people.  We do not know if there are ghosts haunting him or if he has a combination of gene heredity and ESP.<br />There is an amazing barroom brawl scene where Tilden and a bruiser go at it and savagely beat each other but still address each other as gentlemen.  That was a piece of amazing writing!<br />If you can find this one get it!	2000-12-05
US	50909980	RCUB8DI8WS9R3	0446604844	473671370	Total Control	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Too Unrealistic	This is one of those books that I simply didn't like but was compelled to continue reading to the end.  It is one of those books where the heroine, Sidney Archer, tries to unravel a mystery even though she will probably end up dead.  (in real life anyone that does what she does would have been dead about 50 times.   She just seems to have &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; luck for getting out of dangerous situations).  Any sane person in the same position would probably quit their search at the beginning.   That is why I feel the book was unrealistic.  Other things that make it unrealistic is that as Sidney's saga moves on she all of a sudden becomes like The Girl from U.N.C.L.E in her resourcefulness and her ability to shoot a gun.<br />There is also no real explanation why an FBI agent helps her even though he believes her to be guilty.  A woman's charm can only go so far.<br />There is also a part of the book where a &quot;crack&quot; investigator is meeting with her.  You think that he is going to be the big hero of the book, but he is immediately knifed in the back.  This was an interesting plot twist (kind of like Janet Leigh being killed off early in the Psycho movie).<br />The ending of the book disappointed me.  (I don't want to say too much because it would be a spoiler to those who haven't read the book).  I felt that it was unrealistic too.	2000-11-24

I knew very little about neanderthalls before I started and I picked up a lot of information.  Some of the readers said the book was lacking in scientific fact.  Regardless I still enjoyed the characters and found them quite interesting.  The scientist that ends up living in the community was a quite believable fanatic.  It can be so easy to fall in love with a primitive world at the expense of giving up the outside world.<br />With their interesting abilities you wonder why more didn't survive.  Their society did seem to have communist overtones as well as their ultimate defeat.<br />Some things the book could have done a better job with - there is a riddle on a slab of stone that you think will matter highly to the story.  The author makes it seem that by solving the riddle, everthing will be resolved in the end.  I think the Neanderthals would have been defeated in the end the same even if the riddle had not been solved.<br />I agree with one of the other readers that said that the soldiers were overplayed and contributed little to the story.  They reminded me of the two FBI agents from the Die Hard movie that seemed to be added to the movie as a kind of comic relief.	2000-11-17

An ingenious plot that I remember from my childhood.  Now I am enjoying it again with my children.  I was always fascinated by how he balanced those hats.  The illustrations are quite simple but intriguing.  Just looking at Pezzo with all those hats piled one on top of another is more interesting than many of the high tech special effects I have seen in today's movies.  Sometimes the simple way is the best.<br />Pezzo's situation looks bleak as the monkeys that stole his caps are scattered high in the tree.  His act of frustration actually serves to get his stolen caps back from the playful monkeys.  It shows a child that no matter how impossible a situation is, if you think you can find a solution.<br />If you can find it, I also recommend Pezzo the Peddler.  In that one he goes to a circus carnival and his hats fall off and the circus performers mistakenly take them.  This book has a lot more text but also a more intricate plot.	2000-11-17

Rovin captures brilliantly the feel of the original Universal Classics.  He ties together all original tales and brings them forward into the present time with plausible explanations.  He solves some of the unexplained mysteries from the original tales (ex. why Bela turned into an actual wolf rather than a wolf man in the original film).  It does get a little gory towards the end.  Rovin brings everything to a satisfactory close but gives some tidbits at the end for a sequel.  Hopefully the demand will be there for one.	2000-11-17

Astronauts trapped in a space station with a life form that is neither bacterial or animal that can enter any orifice of the human body.  The creature literally disolves it's human host from the inside over a period of a few days in some of the most gruesomely graphic scenes I have ever read.  The astronauts know that they will not be allowed to return to earth and that each will shortly succumb to the same terrifying demise.<br />I found the creatures a lot more terrifying than the ones from the Aliens series because those could be fought with bullets and whatever weapons were at hand.  This creature assumes the DNA value of its host so in effect becomes immune to antibiotics and any other drug that might poison it (anything strong enough to kill it would kill the host too).  Also this creature can move like the Blob, just oozing along to enter the ears or eyes of its victims.<br />As a sideline we have a relationship of a soon to be divorced married couple (like Bruce Willis and his enstranged wife in Die Hard), who basically still love each other but because of their careers have grown cold to each other.  Even though they have limited interaction during the book, they still seem to transmit their still loving feelings to each other.<br />Then we have the Air Force trying to cover everything up in the name of national security.<br />I truly could not put this book down and even though I found it to be terrifying it was compelling at the same time.  This is definately one to take along for a long plane ride.	2000-11-16

Some of those books had interesting beginings but The Firm and The Pelican Brief went off to become like a James Bond or Mission Impossible episode.  This book does not suffer that fate and is far better then the other books.<br />The first chapters are told in the first person and are some of the best writing I have ever read.  The main character Nate is a very &quot;likable&quot; loser.  He is someone with smarts who let liquor and bad choices in his life lead to a life of ruin.  He is in and out of rehab with only temporary results.  He meets a missionary named Rachel that he ultimately falls in love with.  I guess he loves her because she is the most happy person he has ever met and surely the most G-d-faithful person he has ever seen.  He comes from a world where lawyers have no interest in their clients, only in their fees and how they can maximize their hourly billings.  The missionary lives in a primative environment and has absolutely no interest in the 11 billion dollars that has been left to her.  The proverbial two ends of the spectrum.<br />It is Rachel's spiritual beauty and her fervent religious belief that does for Nate, what none of his expensive rehab has done.  Get rid of his desire for alcohol.  It is a good attempt by Grisham and it plays out very well.  However, I cannot figure out Rachel's attraction to Nate (unless he is a lovable loser).<br />The Phelen clan is quite large and it is difficult to keep track of who is who.  Maybe Grisham should have supplied one of those tree diagrams with all the players (like Toltsoy did for War and Peace).  <br />Hark Gettys is the leading lawyer representing them and though he is a villian, he is quite likable.  It is interesting how he gets Snead (the star witness for the Phelen clan) to build his testimony.<br />All in a good read (but don't take it on a trip since there are plane crashes and boat sinkings in it).	2000-11-03

He was an interesting combination of Napoleon Solo/James Bond.  He is brought back brilliantly in this novel which marvelously captures the feel of the original series.  I hope the author tries his hand at more Mr. Seven stories!<br />For whatever reason, Kirk doesn't seem to trust Gary Seven.  I found this surprising since Kirk already knew what Seven's life was about.	2000-11-03

The main character, Jeremy illegally breaks into computers using social engineering techniques to impersonate others(therefore I did not like him from the start).  He gets into top secret files are being guarded by unscrupulous powerful government people.  You wonder how they can't find out that someone got into their computer files.<br />His girlfriend's father dies under somewhat mysterious circumstances and his girlfriend becomes an expert in knowing that it was a government plot.  <br />Out of nowhere Jeremy is walking with his girlfriend and some of the government operatives try to kill him.  He kills one and the others flee.  Then Jeremy goes to visit the project that the bad guys run.  How come they can't figure out that Jeremy is the same guy they tried to kill.<br />Jeremy calls the sheriff from a bugged phone and goes to the police station.  He also pokes around in an off-limits computer and sneaks into an off-limits lab.  How does this guy stay alive?<br />The bad guys' hit man is supposed to be a &quot;gold star&quot; government operative adept at disposing of &quot;targets&quot; but he doesn't suspect Jeremy and when he does, he is reluctant to harm Jeremy.<br />Michael Crichton has never had so many flaws in his writing so I do not know why the reviewers compare this book to Crichton.  A much better novel on genetic engineering was &quot;Mount Dragon&quot; which was much more believeable.<br />I gave the book 3 stars because it does have some tense action and some touching scenes in the hospital with terminally ill children.	2000-10-12

It adds the intrigue of finding a crucified skeleton.  This skeleton makes certain  Christians cringe because if it is what they suspect, they must question  their own religion.  Those Christians will stop at nothing to have all  evidenced destroyed and those who know of it, silenced.<br />I wouldn't be  surprised if the Church tried to have this book silenced.  I guess this  book came out about the time of the Godfather III which had its own hints  of the Church using murder to silence those that stand in its way.	2000-07-24

I liked alot of the book.  Especially thelawyer.  But I cannot say it is one of the greatest books I have ever read.  It is not even the best Grisham (I like The Client the best).<br />The courtroom dialog was great and the tension was great. What kept me from giving the book higher marks was that I cannot condone what the father did, since he shot the innocent police officer.  I found how Grisham downplayed the shooting of the cop to be a major omission of the book.<br />The only justified homicide to me is in a self-defense situation. If the father had shot the men in the act of attacking his daughter, then I would have felt his actions justified.  He did not even wait for the trial to play out before he decided to be judge, jury, and executioner.	2000-03-31

The only thing that saved this book is the underlying theme of the mistreatment of the Irish by the British during the  1860's.<br />The character of Joanna is a mystery as to why she helps Clay  even before she knows him.  Why she hates what her uncle does but still  supports him is another mystery.  How she shows up in the neck of time at  the beginning of the book to save Clay a couple of times and then becomes a  hinderance to him the rest of the book is grating.  The romance between  them is very awkwardly written.<br />Clay is very reckless am seems to have  Indiana Jones's luck for getting out of tight spots.  He becomes the  legendary Captain Swing and it takes quite awhile for anyone to figure out  that Captain Swing is him (really?).  Even though he has the best horse  around, nobody can figure out it is him from his horse.  That is like  accepting that no one can see that Clark Kent is Superman.<br />Clay has a  servant named Joshua.  We are not sure if Joshua was a slave or what and  why he stays with Clay.  Some of the dialog exchanges are very  stereotypical and annoying.<br />It seems like the author saw The Scarecrow of  Rumney Marsh, Batman, Zorro, Indiana Jones, and the Green Hornet and then  tried to combine all the plots and make a book.<br />This is my introduction  to Higgins and I understand that some of his other titles are more  superior.  I do not know what he was thinking when he wrote this one  though.	2000-03-30

The thought of manipulating dangerous viruses to create truly world ending strains is scarry.

I don't know if the idea of going back in time to invent yourself originated with this tale or not.

Also  a New Twilight Zone episode where an Elvis Presley impersonator goes back  in time seeking the original Elvis and ends up creating himself as the  original Elvis.  Moorcock does a masterful job of presenting a similar tale  and keeping it fresh.<br />I can understand that some Christians may consider  this blasphamous but if you just accept this story as a fantasy, then your  religious convictions should not get in the way.  Probably if the actual  Jesus was not portrayed as an idiot and Mary not portrayed to be a harlett,  then it would have attracted a larger audience. <br />The premise of this book  shows that anyone from this time could be mistaken to be god if he went  back in time.  I guess with the absence of science in the past, this is  quite possible.	2000-03-22

The book that began the Anne Rice craze.  By far the best in the series (sequels never live up to the original).  I for one found this to be a complete tale that had no  need for any follow-up.  However, the power of the dollar and a legion of  fans caused Ms. Rice to try to invent some sort of follow-up tales.<br />The  character of Louis is so interesting as is the mysterious LeStat.  We also  have a fascinating cast of characters inhabiting the Theater of the  Vampires.<br />The narration is fascinating as the interviewer observes all  types of eerie body movements from his vampire subject during the  interview.	2000-03-22

Unfortunately, the way it was presented made a lot of it seem boring.  If it had flowed in a more interesting way, I could have  easily given the book 5 stars.<br />It is difficult to determine what is fact  and what is fantasy.  Even with the extensive footnotes it is sometimes  hard to understand.  Someone familiar with Gary Jennings and especially  Raptor can see what might have been with Crichton's novel.<br />The book has  its moments though, such as when the narrator explains that as long as you  realize that you should be observing a Moslem custom, you are not violating  any Moslem rules by not actually observing them.  Also, you feel some  compassion with the narrator when he cannot pray to Allah because the  Norsemen would take offense to it and when he is forced to join the  Norsemen because the lucky 13th member of their party must be a  foreigner.<br />The funeral for the king was extremely interesting, with the  slave girl volunteering to be killed with the dead king.<br />All in all I  think this could have been a book of epic proportions had a better and more  flowing writing style been employed.	2000-03-21

Considering that the history of Mexico is something many Americans know or care little about, I would highly recommend this book to change  those perceptions.<br />Had a man like Mixtli been in charge, perhaps Spanish  would not have been the language of Mexico today.<br />The main character  Mixtli is so deep and his perceptions of things around him are so  engrossing.  What he accomplished during his lifetime (if he were not  fictionalized) would be greater than anyone in history.<br />I have read The  Journeyer and Raptor (both phenomenal in their own right) also by Mr.  Jennings and see alot of recurring themes.  His main character is a  wanderer that meets all the great people of the era and experience all of  life's pleasures and horrors from human sacrifice to incest to  homosexuality.  Most of these topics can make us cringe but Mr. Jennings  has a way of making these things sound provacative and compelling.<br />His  descriptions of events seem to always consist of just the right number of  words.	2000-03-17

I am about half way through this book and like it alot better than the first (though I recommend reading the first to get an appreciation of the characters).  It is a lot quicker paced and a whole lot less predictable  than the first.  The underground society is so fascinating and makes one  wonder if the authors have experienced the life first hand.<br />The  characters are interesting and well developed.  In the first book too many  characters were thrown at you and it was difficult at times to distinguish  who was who.<br />At this point in the book we still don't know enough about  the main characters though.  I would like more information about how the  main characters (Margo, D'Agosta, Pendergest, Frock, and Smithback) grew  up.<br />I am also glad that the authors decided not to use the same beast  from the first novel but instead a variation.	2000-03-10

Contrary to the general public, I find Anne Rice someone who got lucky with one book (Interview with the Vampire) and seemed to rehash a lot of the plot in the unnecessary Vampire Lestat.  With this third book she again  rehashes the first book and adds a lot of boring characters and endless  subplots.  I was willing to forgive the liberties that she took with the  vampire legend in the first book because it was well written and had  interesting characters and subplots.  But this one is so boring and painful  that I only had myself wishing it would end soon.<br />The theater of the  vampires and the characters there were so interesting the first telling but  very boring in The Vampire Lestat.  The Egyption vampires were so boring in  Lestat and painful to read about in this epic of boredom.<br />If you want to  read a good vampire tale I suggest Dracula, Interview With the Vampire, or  the early Stephen King novel dealing with vampires (the name escapes me  now).	2000-03-09
