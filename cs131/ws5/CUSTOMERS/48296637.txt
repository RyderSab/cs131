The plot is not one that instantly reveals itself in the beginning. You actually have to wait till the end to figure out the direction that all the characters have been moving toward. This allows Gibson ample time to work on characterization, or, at least, you would think so. I am not saying that the characters are not well developed, but there is just something missing, something keeping the reader from seeing the characters as human.<br /><br />As usual, Gibson paints America in a bleak future. Poverty is rampant, government is invisible, and anarchy rules the day. Unlike some of his other works, this book is not about hackers ruling the world. The assassins in this book are just that. The world is excellently created, partly explained, and somewhat feasible. The setting is the books strongest point.<br /><br />The plot was very vague. Gibson gives enough clues to keep the reader interested and develops the characters enough to make you want to find out more, but seriously lets the reader down in the end. The book almost feels rushed in a way. I would have liked to understand the Idoru's motives, but for that maybe I should have read Idoru first. I had read that this book is stand alone and you need not read one to get the other. I hope that is not true. All Tomorrow's Parties fails as a stand alone. If it skips over the ending because it has already been hashed out in the other book it is excusable. Again, I should have read Idoru first. So that is my recommendation.<br /><br />I recommend this book to people who have read Idoru. I am not saying to read Idoru instead, but read both. This was a decent book that was on par with some of his other stuff. It does seem that he recycles ideas from other books sometimes, but he has never said that they all take place in separate universes. On the contrary, he has reverenced characters and plots from previous stories in follow ups. I digress, read Idoru before you pick up this book.is book.	2005-09-15

As a story, the plot does not flow and the characters, although very smart, lack any real depth.  This was Heinlein's extended diatribe on how he thought the world should be.  Heinlein is probably lucky that this book was not picked up by a publisher.  In the fifties, he would have went to jail for writing such ideas.<br /><br />This book is great as a comparison read to see how much Heinlein changed from his idealistic youth until his libertarian death.  Some of the predictions are true, but, at this time, Heinlein really underestimated how much technological development would come in the near future.<br /><br />I recommend this book to Heinlein fans as a comparison or beginnings work.  I would also recommend this book to economics students as they would be the only ones to truly grasp the economic scenario laid out towards the end.  It could have been more.  I think Heinlein recycled what he thought he could use in other stories.  If you want to read some Heinlein, there are other better selections to choose from.	2005-08-04

The newest addition of Harry Potter is darker and racier than previous books have been.  New loves are found and lost and maybe found again.  The humor that the Weasley twins brought out is absent and the book remains serious throughout.  Harry is back to being curious and able to find trouble Harry, and he is not as angsty as he was in the series' previous incarnation.  Ron and Hermione are rocks that are unchanging.  Malfoy strangely absent for most of the book, is given more depth when he is brought to the forefront.  Most people will hate Snape more after this story, but I believe that there are hints of character development in Rowling's writing of him.  This book brings about great changes for Harry, and by the end, the series is turned on its head.  The series, as originally planned, was only supposed to follow Harry through his seven years at Hogwarts.  This does not look to be the plan anymore, as the ending of the book opens the story up past the enchanted halls of Hogwarts.  Let us hope that Rowling does not get bogged down like Jordan has and is able to take us to the last battle in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />Rowlings writing is improving vastly.  The complexity of the story and number of characters demand it.  She rises to the challenge almost effortlessly.  She makes some hard decisions that she will likely take some pretty harsh criticism for, and the story, along with the characters, is more grown up.  The magical world of Halloween feasts is gone in this book and is replaced by a world in fear of the very magic it cherishes.<br /><br />This book has some mature themes in it, and is therefore recommended for teenagers and up.  If you have a younger child that wants to read the book, I would recommend reading it yourself first.  If you are a fan of the series you will love this book.  If you hated the last book, you will not hate this one.  Rowling recovers nicely in this book.	2005-07-26

The only draw back I could find for this novel was the ending.  It just did not feel right to me.  The holes were filled in what seemed to be a \\"deus ex machina\\" fashion.  It almost seemed as if Clarke had the story all planned out but could not come up with an ending.  It just does not fit with the feeling of the rest of the story.  That being said, Clarke broke the mold on alien invasion with this book.  The aliens do not want to conquer us, but to help us grow.  The irony being that both lead down the same road.  It is a good book and required reading for science fiction fans.	2005-06-29

It is explains different styles and has illustrations as well as descriptions.  The techniques it uses are valid.  My only concern was that this book tends to over simplify things.  Taking cuttings is one example.  The book suggests that this is the best way to get stock.  Anyone that has ever tried to take cuttings realizes the falacy in that.	2005-05-12

Although the college campus is one of the main place christians feel under assualt it is not the only place.  This book covers all the bases from dating to answering hard questions.  It is informative and the lessons it teaches can be applied throughout your life.

It is a little hard to get into at first, but once the story picks up it locks you in and is a very quick read.  If you get bogged down in this book, I would suggest not giving up and pushing through.  The story picks up after all the characters are introduced and the situation is explained.  The ending would be my only complaint.  Not all the issues are resolved at the end of the story.  This is okay if the book leads you to believe that there will be a sequel, but A Wrinkle in Time does no such thing.<br /><br /> Overall this book is very good and highly recommended.  I would suggest this book for readers of all ages.  As Harry Potter has shown us, you do not have to be a child to enjoy children's fiction.  This book is safe for children.	2005-04-11

Guest appearances are made by: Stinky Tech Guy, Wimpy Tech Guy, Anal retentive, does what ever the boss wants tech guy, The unfaithful wife, The talented Chinese Scientist, and the I will analyze members of my family psychologist.<br /><br />  I will preface this review by saying that Prey is the first Michael Crichton book I have read.<br /><br />  That being said, Prey is an average science fiction novel at best.  The science is viable but the story lacks a real hook.  The characters are one dimensional and very stereotypical.  I really did not care for or relate to any of the characters.  Crichton has the ability to scare the reader with the most evil potential of a technology.  He has a gift to see a worst case scenario and create a character, eventhough one dimensional, that has the ability to survive this technology gone wild.<br /><br />  This book was enjoyable and the ending was clever.  It did not get to pager-turner status until the middle to end.  The book did have a nice flow and was written in an after actions report type format that was interesting.  The only bog downs in the story is when Crichton is explaining some elementary techno babble (what is a nanobot anyways?).<br /><br />  This book may do well for fans of thrillers or as an intorduction to sci fi, but the experienced sci fi fan will see this book as lackluster.  I say save your money for the movie when it comes out.	2005-04-08

That being said, it was a disappointing attempt by William Gibson.  Gibson has a certain style that he totally deviates from in this novel.  It is almost as if he were trying to mimic the style of Neal Stephenson, albeit unsuccessfully.<br /><br />Gibson also misses the mark with his characters.  The character of Cayce is well developed, but she is the only one.  Gibson created many compelling and interesting characters, but he did not develop these characters sufficiently.  Gibson could have easily developed some secondary plot lines to give the secondary characters more depth.<br /><br />I really liked the footage mystery though.  The footage takes full advantage of the anonymity of the net.  Anonymous works always inspire curiosity and interest.  Details of the footage, and the cult surrounding it, seemed almost realistic and forced me into a search for Footage Fetish Forums on Google.  A friend of mine suggested that the book should have had a companion website were you could view the footage.<br /><br />All in all, this book was Gibson writing out of his element, trying to mimic Stephenson's recent success.  The book is more mainstream and will invite non-Cyberpunk fans into Gibson's world, but the invitation just is not very good.  Gibson has crossed into the mainstream with a forgettable novel.	2005-03-02

He gives enough subtle clues to make you think that something could be a possibility before he springs it on you.  The effect does not make the novel seem predictable though.  It makes you feel rewarded for your attention.<br /><br />  Deepness centers around two spacing groups emerging simultaneously on a strange spider planet in orbit around a star with a dormancy cycle.  One of the groups ambushes the other which leads to both fleets being almost totally destroyed.  Meenwhile on the planet, the spiders are going through a information age.  There are two superpowers on the planet and they are played against each other in a U.S./Russia cold war type scenerio.<br /><br />  The book is long but fairly quick once you get into it.  It is well written and the characterizations are well done.  The alien spider species first person lulls the reader into a comfortable acceptence of the species, and the humanoid view, presented later in the story, revulses the reader.  This revulsion is also seen in the humanoid character as well that mirrors the readers.<br /><br />  If you enjoy space operas, you will enjoy this book.  You will also enjoy this book if you just like a great story told exceptionally well.  This book does contain some violence and some sexuality, but neither is graphic.	2005-02-19

All of the characters, although not very deep, are very well fleshed out.  The technological aspect is very relavent for the current times of instant internet polls. This was a very quick read which you do not get the pleasure of experiencing in a lot of his novels.  Like most of his works, Stephenson researches what he is talking about and you actually learn something should you choose to do so.  It has the typical Stephenson finish of ending at the climax.<br /><br />You will enjoy this book if you like Stephenson, Science Fiction, Political Fiction, CSI or any of those other shoes, or if you just want a good read.

The writing is excellent and the thought process behind it are even better.  This novel was not only about time travel but about consequences of social philosopies.  Some of the science in the novel is dated but it does not really detract from the novel very much.  It loses one star for length though.  Wells could have written an epic here and totally missed his chance.<br /><br />  Do not confuse this with the recent movie.  The only similarities are that they both were about men in time machines going forward in time.<br /><br />  I would classify this as appropriate for all ages, although, some of the language and ideas may be hard for younger children to grasp.	2005-01-18

Chang writes about her own life as well as the lives of her grandmother and her mother.  Most of the book focuses on the Cultural Revolution and how it affected the general populous.  Chang is a master story teller as she relives the fear and anxiety that was China during the 50's, 60's, and 70's.<br /><br /> I personally could not put the book down.  This book makes you thankful that you were not born in China during Mao times.  China is now under a much more sane administration but an understanding of current Chinese culture requires the insightful look that Chang provides in this book.<br /><br /> This book is ultimately about human nature and betrayal for power.  While reading it, I saw Mao China as a real life 1984.  I felt sorry for China and grew to appreciate the great strides that they have made in spite of Mao and in spite of communism.<br /><br /> This book is highly suggested to anyone with any interest in China, Communism, or cultural studies.  It is also recommended to anyone who thirst for a true scary story.  May not be suitable for children below high school due to some graphic violence.	2005-01-17

He is disgusting, rude, and conceded. Thank goodness there are mutliple plotlines and other characters. I say that it is a train wreck because you can not tear your eyes from it regardless of how disgusting Ignatius gets. You just have to sit back and wait for the other shoe to drop and Ignatius to get what is coming to him. Most of the other characters are pretty good, but Ignatius is the protagonits of the book so all plotlines eventually lead back to him. The book has a final twist at the ending that will leave the reader a bit frustrated. This book is definately worth reading, and it did win a pulitzer. It is a fairly quick read and is recommended for college age and above.	2005-01-16

Gibson's visionary look at the future is the inspiration to a whole new generation of writers. Without Neuromancer, there would be no Matrix movie. Maybe the Watchowski brothers needed to read it again before they made Matrix 2 and 3. Gibson is a true visionary in that he saw where the internet was going before it got there. He saw the underground hacker community evolving into elite information agents. Gibson's futer is not pretty or nice but can be both. Human enhancement by computer seems gross, but can produce a seductive character such as Molly. The Characters are all very well written and you can see where they are coming from. Case is not a hero, but rather a selfish survivalist. Case, in other words, is a real person. The plot, once it starts, is paced well enough that you rip through the second half of the book very quickly. The story is not suprising in its conclusion, but the character relationships is the real driving force behind this novel. This is a must read for any Cyberpunk fan and most Science Fiction fans. Recommended High school and up. There are some sexual references but nothing you can't get off of daytime TV.	2005-01-16
US	48296637	R1TWEBI4HZZC0	0553380958	445913	Snow Crash	Books	5	2	5	N	N	Rebirth of Cyberpunk	Hiro Protagonist is not a normal guy.  He delivers pizzas for the mob, and if they are late, so too will be Hiro.  They give Hiro a gun to protect himself, but he prefers the precision of his samurai swords.  Hiro is a hacker as well, one who works better freelance.  He is half-Korean half-black and he is a citizen of Mr. Lee's Hong Kong franchise, but he lives in a U Store it.  The world he lives in is not the United States of present, but one were the United States is one of many franchises struggling to survive.  Hiro's world is technologically advanced and ethnically diverse.  This world is a very dangerous place.<br /><br />We meet Hiro as he is delivering a pizza, a pizza that looks as though it is going to be late.  Although Hiro wrecks his car, the pizza is delivered thanks to a skateboard currier name YT.  This act saves Hiro's life and indebts the Mob to YT.  This book only gets more interesting as it goes.  The central plot line of this novel is that of a virus called snow crash.  Snow crash not only infects computers but also hackers who's brains understand binary code.  There is a physical form of the virus that affects normal people as well.  Hiro's friend is infected with the snow crash virus so Hiro sets out to discover who is responsible.  YT's newly formed relationship with the mob gets her involved also.  The virus turns out to be a program that affects the bios of the brain.  It resets the brains of the people infected back to pre tower of Babel days.  Everyone infected is able to communicate in this early language.  The virus is being spread in order to control the people infected, because like a computer they can have commands written directly into their brains.<br /><br />Stephenson meticulously researches Syrian history and mythology.  He crafts a virus as unique as his world and then pumps in enough history and fact to make it all seem almost plausible.  His writing is so descriptive and detailed that it forces the reader to research the facts themselves.  Stephenson takes something as seemingly boring as linguistic theory and draws an intriguing novel out of it.  This excellent research is not limited only to Snow Crash.  Stephenson repeats this with most of his works.  Diamond Age goes deep into the theories of nanotechnology and Cryptonomicon is so bogged down with math and code breaking that it turns off many readers.  That said, the mythology presented in Snow Crash is somewhat overwhelming.<br /><br />Stephenson is known as a cyberpunk author and this book definitely falls into the cyberpunk category.  Hiro becomes a gargoyle, someone always patched into the net, and owns a house right off of main street in the Metaverse (a representation of the world wide web).  Hiro himself is half-Asian and lives by the samurai code.  The franchises are ruling the world and society is being divided into the haves and have-nots.  Orwell's 1984 is a reality, except that it is not just three nations controlling the world but three hundred.  This book brought cyberpunk back from its presumed death.  If William Gibson is the god of cyberpunk, Snow Crash makes Neal Stephenson Jesus.<br /><br />The story flows along following the perspectives of different characters.  Hiro Protagonist, as his name would imply, is the main character, but we also see Stephenson's creation through YT and other minor characters.  A well-placed view from Spot the dog is refreshing if not a little sentimental, and the misadventure of a Mob flunky adds humor to the story at just the right time.  The use of different character perspectives maximizes Stephenson's ability to cast different moods and tones in a way that would be impossible just following Hiro.  It also gives the reader a different worldview.  Stephenson is able to show how the rest of the world operates outside of Hiro's limited view.<br /><br />Stephenson does have a weakness in his endings though.  He writes such a colorful and lively story and then it just suddenly stops.  The story hits its climax and ends there.  There is no resolution.  This is a common theme with other works of his as well.  Snow Crash, Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon, and Interface (written as Stephen Bury) all have a tendency to end at the climax.  The upside to this style is that it allows the readers to finish the story themselves.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this excellent book.  You do not have to like cyberpunk to enjoy the fast-paced action of this novel.  In fact, this novel could be the launching pad to a love of cyberpunk.  It is a quick and enjoyable, high octane joy ride into an alternate present.  Some may be sensitive to the religious themes explored in this book, but this book does not take a theological stand in any regard.  I would not recommend this book for children due to some sex and violence, but the book is not graphic in either aspect.he story hits its climax and ends there.  There is no resolution.

Of course, you have to suspend disbelief, but this is easy as long as you just redefine mars as a planet in another galaxy or something.  Science proved wrong alot of what was written in this book.  Stereotubes?  The were TV's then.  Like a good reader though, I can suspend disbelief and believe that people call the TV a stereo tube.<br />Some where in the second or third section the book turns to complete crap.  It becomes Heinlein's reactions to religion and philosophy.  Most religions are blasphemed and free love orgies run rampant.  The way Mike makes things just disappear has me worrying about the environment and I really don't see what humans are doing know as that damaging.  Did I mention this book is sexist.  Women are nurses, strippers, secretaries, rites of passage in new religions.  The purpose of women in this story is to serve men, even sexually.  (...) But every man realizes that this is just a male fantasy.<br />Read something else.	2004-04-04

There is a good story there, but it drags and lacks the sense of discovery that you get from the first installment.  It was a worthwhile read, and I do plan to read the third book in the series.

Get us to the final battle and I promise you that people will buy the books in the spin off series about every third tier character that you feel needs a place in the main series.<br />Regardless of who you are, do not support Robert Jordan stealing from us by buying this book.  We have to send a message that we want closure.	2004-02-17
US	48296637	R2ZS0NX2OHVPUD	0394744209	359221301	The Assault	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A very good read	Spanning from WWII to the 1980's is a very difficult task.  To do this in 180 pages is near impossible.  Mulisch does this successfully with The Assault.  This story follows Anton as his family is murdered for simply having a member of the Nazi party dead in front of their house.  Anton suppresses the memories of the events and restarts his live with his aunt and uncle.  Through out his life though people continue to show up and jar his memory and desire to understand what happened.<br />Mulisch could have made this story longer and no one would have complained.  He is poetic in his language and lets his readers find the details instead of revealing them.  The 5th star is absent because I felt the book had some political preachiness and it seemed unrealistic for the Anton character to move on the way he does.<br />All in all it was a very good and quick read.  Suggested for all ages.	2004-02-17

What would happen if you loved someone who could never recipricate the feeling.  That is what happens to Alma.  This play explores this quest for love and the damages it can do on a small town girl.  This story does not have that usual happy, well wrapped up ending that most of us expect stories to have.	2004-01-24
US	48296637	R5N142FTDCOA7	0553208845	36215520	Siddhartha	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Enlightening	Siddhartha is a coming of age story of sorts.  The main character Siddhartha is trying to find his way to enlightenment.  He is very smart and learns all that he can from the Brahmin(priests).  His father is a Brahmin and expects Siddhartha to follow in those steps as well.  Siddhartha sees that he has learned all that he can from the Brahmin and sets out for more knowledge.  This pattern is repeated.<br />  This book is a great introduction to Indian Religion and Buddhism.  It takes place during the years of the Buddha, and the Buddha makes an appearance in the novel as one of Siddhartha's teachers.  This journey to one man's enlightenment will make you question all you think you know and appreciate most of what you take for granted.  I can see why monks devote their whole lives to contemplating their existance.  One would have to, to understand all of the subtle nuances of eastern religions.<br />  This book will not brainwash anyone into Buddhism, if anything the complexities expressed in this novel will turn them off to Buddhism. There is no violence in this book, but there are some sexual themes.  High School age and above should enjoy reading this novel.  Parents, if you child reads this book, read it as well and discuss it with them.  This book having religious themes may raise questions.  Questions you should answer not a public school teacher.	2004-01-21

Although some of the concepts are dated, that can be forgiven due to the age of the book.  Asimov truly forsaw the way the world was heading, he was just a little optimistic about the timeline.<br />  This book is more or less a book of shortstories concerning the three laws of robotics.  Although the main characters are human (or are they), the robots steal the show.  The stories connect on an emotional level with the reader, which is why they have lasted after the technology of the stories has been outdated.<br />  This book is suitable for anyone whom can read it.  There is no sexual material and almost no violence.  Parents should not fear this book.  It is not a children's book though.  There are political and social messages to find if you look closely.  Science Fiction the way it was meant to be.	2004-01-19

I will explain.  For years I have been reading this series, and for many of those years the series was good.  Then Jordan started milking the story and dragging it on.  There is now no end in site.  He has shown that he can write a whole book that takes place in the last 5 minutes of the previous book.  Ladies and Gentlemen Robert Jordan has sold out.  To cash in even more on the story that people have to read to see how it all would end (the man is still a talented writer afterall), he has released a prequel.  Jordan should have put this time and effort into finishing the series at hand.  I think Jordan has lost a great many readers in the past few years, and I think this book will encourage more migration.  Read Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series instead.	2004-01-08

Then you get to read about how his marriage is breaking up.  Lance can not figure out what went wrong, but anyone who reads these two books are bound to figure it out.  This book took, a person with a truly inspirtational story, and dissolved it all away.  I do not think that I care for Lance anymore.  It is lucky that he can get specially made equipment, because it is the only way he will get a helmet to fit over his enourmous head.  Do not buy this book.  Do not read this book if you want to respect Lance Armstrong.	2004-01-02

This book does not push partisan politics, as shown by his chapter on partisan politics.  Beck is refreshingly honest about everthing in this book.  The views he presents are the views that the average American has.  They are the same views that most Americans feel alone in having.  Lots of people will read this book and say, &quot;I have known/thought this for years, why didn't I write this book?&quot;  Did I mention that the book is hillarious.  This book is a very quick and informative read.  Highly suggested.	2003-12-26

It was so close to non fiction, I had to go to the net and look up names, places, and events.  All of them were nailed, with the excpetions of things he changed to work within the story.  The book takes place at two time periods:  WWII and the late 1990's.  Both periods of time focus on two families, that are thrown together in both time periods.  The book does seem to drag a little in places but is very exciting and intricate in other places.  An ongoing Stephenson problem is with his endings.  This book although not a clear consise ending (yes it just kind of stops), actually works here (or I am just getting used to it).  Overall it was a very good book.  It is long, but worth the time you put into it.	2003-12-19
US	48296637	RFRVMI3ZLVLM	156931778X	419611869	Battle Royale	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Battle Royale	I picked up this book after watching the movie of the same name.  Being a consumer of media that promotes sensless violence, I was much impressed with the movie.  I assumed, and was not mistaken, that the novel would take a deeper look into character motivations.  Not unlike Heinlen (Starship Troopers), there is a political message in the book that was not translated into the movie.  The story itself is both uplifting and disturbing.  42 students on an island forced to kill one another or die.  Who can you trust, if everyone else's life depends on you dying?  This novel has more backstabbing and strategizing than a season of survivor, but will suprise you in the end.  This book is not recommended for children.  Parents read this book before you let your older children read it.  It does have some sexual refrences and alot of violence.  Everyone else should read this book, and try to understand the political message, Think, Learn, and Speak.  Enjoy!	2003-12-19

In the tradition of Harry Potter and Ender Wiggin, we see a child prodigy.  Only this time there is a twist.  The prodigy is all grown up.  Shaw brilliantly weaves technology, humor, and romance into a hip, age-blind novel.  Unlike Harry Potter, most of Shaw's world is realistic and possible.  Children will be able to relate to Cameron and Rosa.  As Cameron and Rosa learn not only life leasons but history lessons so will the reader.  Shaw has a winner here.	2003-11-25

May not be suitable for readers unwilling to contemplate the ending of the book for days afterwards.  This book exist in two dimensions.  The first is the reality of Japan in the 80's, only with an information war going on.  The second is happening inside of &quot;the end of the world,&quot; which is more of a subconsious.  The two effect each other, but in what way?  That is what will leave you thinking for days on in.  I finished and thought that was simple.  An hour later, I am questioning everything I thought.  Very good book.  Highly recommended to those who don't mind thinking while they read.	2003-11-24

This a story about the oppression of African Americans.  This is a story of hope.  Jefferson is an innocent man and he will die because a white man has died and he was there when it happened.  Grant is an educated black man who has come back home to teach school.  Jefferson must learn from Grant how to be a man, ironicly that is the same thing Grant must learn from Jefferson.  This novel is a must read.  It is as accurate as you are likely to get when it comes to pre-civil rights race relations.  The story is very emotional and will pull at the hardest of hearts.	2003-11-11

Lance is completely honest and forward with all aspects of his life.  The detail in the cancer treatment section was amazing.  Lance seems pretty full of himself.  Not without reason though.  He is the best rider out there and he has beaten cancer, and he will not let you forget it. It was a very interesting book and I ripped through it very quickly.  This book is for everyone, you don't have to have cancer or be a bike rider to understand or enjoy this book.  Enjoy!	2003-10-19

Leave it there and when you are feeling a little down or depressed pick it up.  I took the advice offered in the introduction and tried to read a couple of my favorite letters out loud to people.  I was in tears.  This book is meant to be taken in small doses so don't sit down and read it from cover to cover.  Pay attention to the small quirky details he puts into the letters, they are the funniest parts.  Read some letters out loud and see if you can finish them.	2003-08-14

Cover art sells books for sure.  I started reading this book and had to flip back to the cover to make sure that I had never heard of the author before.  This book was extremely well written.  Some of it is predictable but you get mad at the characters for not seeing the obvious, but that adds to the realism because real people would not see the obvious either.  I really enjoyed this book.  It is light science fiction that readers of Sci-fi and mainstream should enjoy.  Books this good cross genre boundries.	2003-08-14
US	48296637	R23IG5M55Z3YFX	0441010237	449396053	Hyperthought	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Enjoyable	This is a very fast paced book with lots of action.  At under 200 pages it is a very fast read.  I do think that the breivity of the book does sacrifice character development.  The only character we get to know is Jolie and we only get a small glimpse into her past.  I was never sure what made her tick and the character (not unlike real women) seemed inconsistent.  I would have liked to have a more indepth look into the characters and into how society had transformed from present day into the bleak future Buckner paints.  This is a good sign though.  My idea of a good book is one that leaves you wanting more and yet there is no sequel to ruin the mystique.	2003-08-14

Harry seems to want everyone to feel sorry for him.  He spends half the novel complaining that no one understands him and everyone is ignoring him.  The other half is spent pining after Cho.  When is Harry going to figure out that Snape is not his enemy?  The Dark lord does make a token appearance, but Umbridge is the real story.  This is the worst book of the series but it is a great series and one of them had to be the worst.  Let us just hope Harry straitens himself out in time for year 6.	2003-07-21

Hajime has one big regret, his childhood sweetheart.  When she resurfaces later in his life, he is thrown into a midlife crisis that will force him to make some tough decisions.  Murakami carefully crafts each character in this novel, so that you almost forget that it is a work of fiction.  He makes it instead feel like a memory.  The characters in this novel live in each of us. Murakami is able to force us to look inside to find them.  Read this book!	2003-06-18

Path is being ruled by people mutated to have obsessive compulsive disorder.  Ender Wiggin and his family are the only hope for the humans on both of these colonies, as well as the two other sentinant species on Lusitania. This novel is deeply complex with different scientific hypothosis being discussed.  The story though complex never lets you put it down.

I knew that girls had always loved this book, so I set myself up for a girlie novel.  Elizabeth, the protaganist, is anything but a simple girlie character though.  This book attacks the social structure of Austen's days.  The characters are deep and well written.  Some are characatures for comic relief, but you still come away with the feeling that you have known someone like that in the past.  This book is a classic for a reason.  I recommend this book to anyone, not just love sick teenage girls.	2003-04-24

It is a hard book to follow with a bunch of characters that are only in the book briefly.  It is very funny and the country mouse in the city effect is very well done.

This story proves the power of literature. This book also shows the flaws inherent in the re-education camps.  You can change someone, but you can never control how they change.  Very good and very quick.	2003-03-14

It is key to the story that you somewhat understand how it works.  The story is very compelling and you find yourself cheering on the characters.  My one and only complaint is that the book does not end, it just stops.  You are reading along and the end of the action takes place and so does the book.  There is no wrap up or were are they now summaries.  It is a very good book regardless and highly recommended.	2003-02-13

You have no idea what is going to happen next and when you guess you are often wrong.  The plot line is not a line at all.  Just like real life characters change and things go haywire some time.  This book is really light fantasy that most readers will enjoy regardless of genre.  Martin writes a very good non stop story.	2003-02-13

This is a look at psychology as well as polotics.  This novel reveals the strenghts' of human spirit as well as the weakness' of the human mind.  Orwell wrote this book as a warning.  Educate yourself, read this book.	2003-02-13

Steakley takes a little less political stance than Heinlein.  This book is action packed and really shows you the violence of war.  The dialogue of the soldiers is realistic.  This book captures the soul of the common soldier.	2003-02-13

This book stinks because nothing substantial at all happened. NEW CHARACTERS were introduced. Get on with the story of the characters whom we have grown to love and whom we bought the book to find out about. There was no character development or plot development. I now have a clearer sense of what people looked like, dresses, smiles and all. This series is like a professional athlete; If it sticks around too long it will become a laughing stock. Robert Jordan if you are reading this, the reader wants closure. I seriously think he will die of old age before finishing the series.	2003-02-03

By the time you put it down you realized that it has moved you.  When Watanabe read Midori's letter I felt an emptiness in my stomach as if she had written the letter to me.  The whole book is like this.  You can't help but fall in love with the characters.	2003-02-03
