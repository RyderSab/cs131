One series of books that I never wanted to read was the Left Behind series.  I'm a Christian (Episcopalian), but I never liked the idea of turning the Bible's prophecies into an easy-reading fictional account of what would happen.  But a few days ago, I decided to take the plunge and actually try reading them. <br /> <br />The authors' style wasn't all that great, to me.  The books seemed too... I don't know... the dialogue was really cheesy, and the plot lines were VERY impossible (this coming from a person who likes Dickens).  But I guess you can say that they weren't WRITTEN to be that way-- they were written by two ministers to communicate the last days of earth in an understandable way for people who don't necessarily read the Bible.   <br /> <br />I started with Left Behind, then Tribulation Force, then Nicolae, and, in three days, had them finished.  I didn't come away liking the books as a whole, but they did serve a purpose: <br /> <br />As soon as I finished Nicolae, I opened up my Bible to Revelations and started reading.  I have a King James version, so I'd always been a little intimidated by the wording, and the books clarified what a few of the prophecies were that I might not have understood otherwise. <br /> <br />So, my final conclusion.  Don't use this as an alternative for the Bible-- there really ISN'T an alternative for that.  But do use them to greater understand the prophecies of God and Jesus.  I think that the authors would love to find out that they were of use, in that respect. <br /> <br />--Me	2005-04-18

It was originally written by Mildred A. Wirt Benson, under the pseudonym 'Carolyn Keene'. The originals looked exactly like this- well, except they didn't have the gold sticker-thing.<br />But the terrible thing is that the originals were re-written, under the same name, but not by the same person, in the fifties. The books lost the spirit and fire that they had originally had, and, unless you were a frequenter (a LUCKY frequenter) of antique malls, you wouldn't be able to find the original text.<br />Until now.<br />These books are the originals, and I personally like them much more than the other, later editions. The stories are longer, the pictures are wonderful (they are) and the story itself is much better.<br />If you have a choice between a newer version and this one- there's no choice. Get this one.	2004-07-17

The language in question used bodily functions other than the standard speaking.<br />It's about a young, purple alien named Pleskit that is taken along by his father to Earth as part of a trade mission. Pleskit is enrolled in a public school, and, thanks to some wrong information about how Earthlings always speak the truth, Pleskit succeeds in making most of the kids at school hate him.<br />Except for Tim Tompkins, that is, resident alien enthusiast. He's psyched out of his mind to see a real, live alien and wants to make friends with Pleskit, but something always comes up- like, Pleskit seemingly attacking another boy at school, for example.<br />So Tim forms a plan to meet Pleskit by hiding in his 'personal needs' room (a.k.a. bathroom) and hoping to make a good impression. Surprisingly, he does, and is invited to Pleskit's house.<br />Tim's excited, of course, and Pleskit is outraged to hear that his database was tampered with (the whole Earthlings lie thing). They decide to scope out their number one suspect's room, but they see him coming and quickly duck into Mikta-Makta-Mookta's room (Pleskit's father's secretary). There, they discover that she has something that shouldn't be in her room...<br />I really liked this book, and it's great for kids that are in fifth and sixth grades.	2004-07-11

Let me count the ways:<br />One, he has no authority to answer to whatsoever. If anything, HE is the authority. His father is assumed dead, his mother is in shock... Not saying that the whole 'dad's dead, mom's crazy' thing is what kids want, but the whole 'kid ordering around help' is great. And there's the whole not going to school thing.<br />Two, he has his own private bodyguard, a huge guy named 'Butler'. That pretty uch speaks for itself.<br />Three- he's a genius. And that's cool no matter how you slice it.<br />And, four- he has the means to start a war between the fairies of the world and the humans.<br />How, you may ask? Well, he has found that every fairy, leprechaun, sprite, whatever, owns a book that holds all the secrets of their society. All he has to do is find a member of the People, and persuade them for their book... he finds one, and soon figures out how to decode the language that the book is written in.<br />And why would he want to know the secrets of the People? Haven't you kiddoes ever heard of leprechauns' gold? It's actually a fund used for fairies that have been kidnapped, but still... you get a fairy, you get gold. And that's what Artemis is looking for.<br />Problem is, the People don't give up their money without a fight, and he is drawn into a three-person against all-the-fairies war... <br />I liked this book, I really did. I don't understand why some parents wouldn't want their children to read this, unless it was for the 'magic' reasons, but anyway... this is a great book. And decode the message at the bottom after you finish reading it... isn't that hard, and it gives you an inkling about what will happen next in future books.<br />Happy reading!	2004-07-10

The style the book is written in is sort of old-fashioned for today's readers, but if a person can read it, then I definitely recommend it.<br />It's about a type of people, Borrowers, that are very tiny. They live in houses and 'borrow' things, like food, paper, and basically anything that they can get their hands on. They picture people as giants that are put on this earth to make things for them to 'borrow'... They live under floor-boards, behind pictures, over mantles; basically anywhere. That's how Arrietty's mother and father tell it.<br />But, in all reality, there is only herself, her mother, and her father left in that one particular house. Every other Borrower family had emigrated to somewhere else... and Arrietty accepts that until one day she is seen by a boy that puts the thought into her head that maybe her family is the last of the Borrowers.<br />And that's really how it all starts. Arrietty and the Boy form a sort of friendship, where the boy takes a letter to the place where Arrietty's Uncle is supposed to live, and Arrietty reads to him. (The Boy says that he's bilingual, and that's the reason that he can't read well.) And taking the mail isn't the only thing that the Boy does- he also brings the Clocks furniture, food, and other things.<br />Things which are discovered missing later.<br />And that brings in the cat and the rat-catchers... <br />One of my favorite childrens' books; I think the reason I like it so much is that it doesn't take for granted that kids wouldn't be able to understand a longer book... I think that's also what I love about the Harry Potter books, as well. <br />Anyway, read this. Very sweet, very family friendly. Altogether enjoyable.	2004-07-10

I think you'll get a better perspective that way.<br />It's about a society that wants to be 'perfect'. Well, actually, 'perfect' wouldn't be the best word. I suppose that they want everything to be structured and uniform. They call it in the book 'Sameness'. <br />There are books and movies about futures that stink, but, let me tell you, this is an especially insane one. <br />The land is climate-controlled, and completely the same. Flat; no hills, no valleys. No colors, even. And it isn't just the outside that's controlled... The people don't love, aren't sad or guilty... basically, they don't feel human emotions. Only the Receiver is allowed to experience those things, and he is the keeper for the entire community... without him, the memories would be unleashed and the community would revert to chaos.<br />People have their jobs chosen for them, their mates chosen, even their children. You get to old? You're 'released'. (Releasing is killing, if you haven't figured that out.) A twin, and smaller than your brother or sister? You're released. Make a mistake, like flying in the wrong direction? Released. It's scary about what you can't do...<br />Jonas is chosen as the new Receiver, and (surprise) he's the character that the book centers around. We read about his life before he is selected, during, and afterwards, and I don't know about you, but it was a major shock to me that there wasn't color. <br />I'm not sure if I can say that I LOVED this book. Loving would imply that I loved the concepts, and also would imply that I wasn't horrified while I was reading it. Happy little kiddoes in America aren't really exposed to this kind of stuff... not even CLOSE to it. <br />But I really respect it, and totally understand why it's a classic. Lois Lowry got a fan with this book; Number the Stars didn't quite do it for me. <br />Andanother thing I think people need to understand about this book is that even though the text is simple and that youngsters can READ it, the concepts are meant for older kids.	2004-07-08

My definition of a good fiction book is that it's able to persuade you that the story can really happen, even though it seems totally impossible.<br />By the end of this book, I was convinced for a second that Krakatoa, with its diamond mines and 'Gourmet Government' really existed. And that's pretty sad, considering that I should be too old for that kind of stuff.<br />THE 21 BALLOONS follows the adventures of Professor William Waterman Sherman as he tries to escape his old life of school days and bad kids. (He was a math teacher at an all-boys school. I pity him.)<br />He sets out in a balloon, one that has a sort of mini-house as the basket. He spends a few days happily flying around the Pacific ocean, until one day a seagull makes a hole in his balloon. He throws everything overboard, and aims to land on a small island. The island's name? Krakatoa.<br />He is received into the Krakatoan society, and given a share in the HUGE diamond mines that each of the twenty families on the island own. (By the way- I love the way that the society is described in the book. Very detailed. And the naming system, too... though I don't think that I would like to be called something like 'K-2'.)<br />The families live in great wealth and comfort, and they have a society totally based on food. Each day of the month, a different family cooks, and they all have equal shares in the mines. But everything isn't perfect...<br />There's a volcano on the island, one that is REALLY active. It causes the island's earth to continually move up and down in waves... a sort of blessing, and a curse, because it keeps the other people of the world away. Professor Sherman is the first person that had been to their island other than themselves, EVER.<br />And, of course, while Sherman is on the island, the volcano erupts. Luckily, the families all have an escape plan; a huge platform with twenty balloons attached that lifts everyone up and away from the island. Again, problem; they only have 80 parachutes. So Sherman has to try and land the huge platform...<br />As I said, I love this book. One of the best children's fiction stories that I've read, ever... and the magnificent sketches by Mr. du Bois that describe the island really make everything come together more.achutes.

Even description wise... so Steerpike, at his first oppurtunity runs away. He escapes into the castle's upper stories, and then onto the roof... where he stumbles into Lady Fuschia's private rooms.<br />What follows is his conniving struggle to achieve power by stepping on anyone that happens to be in his way.

If you've read the Harry Potter books, you probably remember the characters talking about what a wonderful, exciting and informative book it is.<br />I kind of expected it to be longer, but I suppose that you can't get everything you want... all in all, for an additional book I thought that it was pretty okay. The best things about it were the little comments and tid bits that made it really seem like a book from the Hogwarts library.... the card in the front that has the names of all the kids that checked it out, the introduction from Dumbledore, and the conversion from dollars to sickles and knuts on the back are all really cool.<br />If you're a Harry Potter fan, you have to get this, if just to ease your curiosity on what it's about. But beware- this book has no plot and reads pretty darn boring, except for a few select parts. It clears up quite a bit of the fourth book's Quidditch Cup, and if there are any more matches in future books, I suggest keeping this close at hand.<br />This is rated G, and is really really tame. The fifth book was kind of crazy, what with the teen angst and such, but this takes you back to the happy, carefree world of Harry Potter.	2004-07-05

She doesn't seem to have a very happy life, or, at least, a very interesting one. But that all changes when she decides to take a little nighttime excursion to the lake in her town.<br />While she's there, meditating about her life, a group of vampires appears behind her, gets her into a red dress, and deposits her, for the most part unharmed, in a mansion ball room with another vampire. This vampire is different, though- he's a prisoner, for one thing, and it doesn't seem like he's going to kill her.<br />She, of course, eventually falls in love with this vampire, and it gets a little bit repetitive until the end, where it semi-breaks out in a 'Hey- we aren't gonna die, and we killed the bad guy. Life is good, but, man does it still have problems.' kind of way.<br />My opinion? I kind of liked it, though it takes a while to grow on you and there are these infuriating little bursts in the book where you wonder 'Okay, where did that come from, and why did you take so long to tell me about it?' Other that that, it was pretty darn good and really imaginative, in a certain kind of way. <br />I do have to say this, though- Robin McKinley fans, beware. This is totally unlike Beauty and Spindle's End. It's really kind of dark and depressing, and you wonder why some of the characters do the things they do- or, more importantly, why they don't do the things you want them to do. <br />And kids and parents, beware- this is Rated R in about everything that's possible to be Rated R in. Kids that aren't in high school and mature enough to handle it shouldn't even consider this book.	2004-07-05

This actually makes you think that the characters are people with hearts, souls, and minds. <br />Bianca, the daughter of a poor farmer, is left behind when her father is enlisted to go on a hopeless quest for three apples from the Tree of Wisdom. She grows up in her isolated house with the woman that her father had left in charge, and eventually the woman grows jealous of her beauty and the fact that the little girl drew away the attentions of the man that she's in love with.<br />My opinion? I loved this thing! The only part that I found a bit unbelievable were the dwarves, but even they seemed like lovable little puppies. And I don't think that Bianca could have stayed in a coma for four years without food and water and then awoken with the... effect... that had happened to her.<br />The rating of this would have to be PG-13, but probably it would be safer to say PG-14 and a half.

You have to agree with me there. We have kids going into worlds through wardrobes, we have adults able to teleport themselves through fireplaces... all in all, everything has been done.

The only people that are allowed to travel through these doorways are special 'Travelers' that exist solely to save the world and defeat the bad guy.<br />The bad guy, in this case, happens to be an evil man that can change shape at will and whose natural form is a guy with piercing blue eyes. <br />Bobby Pendragon knows nothing about this when he is enlisted by his 'uncle' to go and help some people do something. What? He doesn't know. How? Why? Those aren't answered either. <br />Turns out there's a revolution starting in a territory called 'Denduron'.

She runs away, terrified, into the forest (well, wouldn't you be terrified if a huge crack opened in the earth and swallowed your whole home?) <br />About a week later, she collapses on the ground from being dehydrated and from an infection on her leg from a cave lion. A lady from The Clan finds her, and she gets accepted into the Clan's tribe.<br />The Clan is a group of primitive humans that have brains formed so that they can remember things from past generations, but have problems learning new things. Ayla, on the other hand, comes from a tribe of the Others, a group of primitive humans that can't remember things quite so well, but can easily adapt and learn new things.<br />Ayla forces the Clan to change, and she is influenced by them.

She has had everything taken away from her: her daughter, her mother, her boyfriend, her best friend, and, most importantly, her identity.

Before reading this, I finished JURASSIC PARK, and, believe me, they both seem pretty different. Don't get me wrong, though- they're both absolutely fabulous.<br />This is mainly about a lost city called 'Zinj' that was a really prosperous and ancient diamond mine in the Congo. Though it had been lost for years, a sort of artifact-hunting American company used technology to find the location. They immediately form a team to go and get it before the rival company finds the diamonds first. Why are these diamonds, that are supposed to be laced with impurities, so desirable? It turns out that these so-called 'blue diamonds' is one of the key factors to the making of super fast- and expensive- computers. Whichever computer company gets these diamonds will have a monopoly on the market for about the next five years- which makes the buyers extra and specially intent ($$$$$$$$$$) to get 'em.<br />But, the team has a bit of a problem. The eight crew members mysteriously were murdered on-site. Video footage of the site shows that the attacker was a black figure that looks exactly like a gorilla. <br />And that's one of the reasons why Amy, a super-smart gorilla that knows-and has conversations- in sign language is recruited for the ride. She had recently been having nightmares of the city, because that was where her mother had been murdered- in exactly the same way that the researchers had.<br />So they set off for the city, prepared for whatever the monster may be...<br />One thing that you have to love about Crichton books is that they're so incredibly scientific. At the beginning, anything can be possible, from aliens to yetis to monsters, but in the end, the REAL scary thing is that it really seems possible. I was a total Crichton fan after reading just one of his books; they all rock, this one included. Even if you're a bit wary about reading a book that sounds so centered around a monkey, go for it. you'll be surprised.	2004-05-09

I don't know what I expected when I started to read this book, but it completely broke all the barriers- and not in such a bad way, either.<br />To just give you a simple overview, this is about a kid who is having a pretty crummy life; his dad is trying to rule his existence and make him carry on the family name, his sister is trying to be perfect, his girlfriend (who he loved, by the way) cheated on him with one of his friends, and a whole bunch of other stuff that just makes you open up your eyes.<br />He's extremely smart, yet he doesn't apply himself. He's stoned for pretty much the entire school day... which is the reason why he gets sent to a counselor's office and is given the assignment of writing a hundred page essay on anything that he wants to.<br />He decides to write an autobiography.<br />My opinion? I definitely would not read this if you're not at least in high school... some of the themes are kind of mature. But, if you can handle it, a really good story just sort of pops out:)	2004-04-26

Trust me. <br />That being said, how about I break into the review?<br />This is about a free-spirited young lady named Lynet *cough* go, girl power! *cough* that gets fed up with her beautiful, yet stupid, sister and her uncle and decides to travel to Camelot to get a knight to challenge the knight that's besieging her family's castle, trying to win her sister's heart.<br />On her way there, she meets up with a dwarf. The dwarf is a pretty nice guy... he leads her to Camelot and then disappears. (Don't worry though- he'll come into play later.)<br />Since her father had acted in a war against Arthur before, she decided to come anonymous into the court. Being anonymous, she couldn't get any proper knight... just a poor, lowly serving boy who is actually a knight in disguise.<br />Yada yada, she falls in love with the guy (she calls him Beaumains) and she meets up with Roger, the little dwarf man, again. Beaumains is valiant, defeats a lot of knights, gets wounded, and is tended by his loving nurse, Lynet.<br />They travel to the castle to rescue Lyonesse (Lynet's beautiful sister) and, unfortuantely, Mr. Beau falls in love with her. Yup- turns out he's a womanizer who falls in love with anyone with a pretty face. *Sob, sob*. Poor Lynet.<br />BUT- ALL IS NOT YET LOST. Remember Mr. Dwarf-Man? Turns out he's-<br />And that's where I leave off. If you want to find out what happens, then you gosh well better read it. You won't be sorry!	2004-04-26

Buck is quite possibly the best picture of pre-Revolution China that you can read. It centers around a man named Wang Lung...<br />When the novel starts, Wang is getting ready to go and retrieve his new wife, a former slave in a grand house. He and his father live in a three room house on their land, and they are very poor. Wang's new wife, O-lan, is really hard working, if kind-of simple, and she bears him three children: three boys and two girls.<br />The family moves to the city during a time of famine, and they experience a revolt in a very, very rich man's house. They come away not only with a lot of gold coins, but also a huge amount of jeweled necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. When they go back to their house in the country, they buy even more land, and soon become very, very rich themselves... what's really amazing is that during all this time, Wang's still a pretty nice guy because he can still work his land and be outside. But then a time of great flooding occurs...<br />Wang gets infatuated by a concubine named Lotus, and he takes her into his house. Poor O-lan is totally neglected, and eventually dies. Wang is completely changed by Lotus, and he feels repulsion for O-lan until she finally dies.<br />They move into a large house and then Wang falls in love with a, like, sixteen year old girl servant (he at the time is SEVENTY) after Lotus starts to age. At the end of the book, he overhears his sons talking about selling the land that he worked so hard to get, and he gets really upset...<br />My thoughts about the characters, starting from the biggest to the smallest:<br />WANG LUNG: changed from good to worse as the book progressed; a few times toward the end you really wanted to go in there and slap him.<br />O-LAN: she did everything possible for her husand and her family, and in the end she didn't get anything at all in the end. It's really sad...<br />LOTUS: For starters, she's a concubine, and then there's the thing that she's incredibly mean and unloyal to everyone else...<br />THE SONS: the oldest needs to get his mind off girls, the second one's okay, but obsessed with money, and the youngest one is just really independent and ends up going to war. None of them are really honorable.<br />THE DAUGHTERS: the 'little fool' can't help herself, and thank heavens the youngest one got married off.<br />PEACH BLOSSOM: why would she do what she did? That really grossed me out.<br />My final opinion: This is good to read, probably some of the best historical fiction that I've ever read, and everything that happens is just so grotesque and scary, especially if you're a girl, that it keeps you reading without stopping. I recommend this to everyone.incredibly mean and unloyal to everyone else...<br />THE SONS: the oldest needs to get his mind off girls, the second one's okay, but obsessed with money, and the youngest one is just really independent and ends up going to war.

This is, indeed, one of the books that won him the Nobel prize, an extraordinary thing to win in the literary world.<br />It's a tale about an old man named Santiago who hadn't caught a fish in 80 days. You would think that that would be no big deal, other than money-wise, but the village people have tagged him as unlucky and washed-up, and a boy named Manolin, whom he loved as a son, was not allowed to fish with him any more. <br />One day he sets out to sea in a small skiff, and he hooks a gigantic marlin (kind of like a swordfish, but really very pretty). The marlin drags him far out to sea, and he feels a great connection with the fish. During the time that he's out to sea, he talks to himself and to the sea a great deal, experiences great pain, and just the teeniest bit starts to lose his mind... in the end, he does kill the marlin, but he finds out that the thing is two feet longer than his boat. This is also a really sad time for him because all through the book it talked about his connection with nature; he called the fish his brother.<br />To recap: He's two days out to sea, he just realized that this HUGE fish that he caught has to be TOWED IN to shore, and he's totally spent both mentally and physically. There would have been a little bit of a chance of getting back to shore with his fish, but then... a large Mako shark appears. A bite is taken out of the fish and the blood pours into the water.<br />Poor old Santiago has to watch as shark after shark comes and rips apart his beautiful fish, and when he gets back home, almost the entire thing is gone, except for the tail, the skeleton, and the head. Santiago is battered and bruised, not only from the catching of the fish, but also from trying to fight off the sharks.<br />It works out okay in the end- Manolin gets to fish with the old man again, and the village fishermen have respect for Santiago. The end just makes you so sad-happy (now that's an oxymoron if I ever saw one), though- an American couple sees the skeleton with the head taken off (Manolin got the head) and they think that the fish is a SHARK. But Santiago's alive, and everything's okay.<br />I just gave the bare facts; if you really want to experience the beauty of the text then you have to read it for yourself. :)	2003-12-19

This book by George Orwell is about a farm (Manor Farm) where a revolution takes place, but a very DIFFERENT kind of revolution. Mr. Jones, the owner of the farm, had been mistreating his livestock, and the animals were absolutely sick of it. Old Major, the oldest boar on the farm, inspired them with a song and a speech about how everything should be blamed on men. Then he dies, leaving Napoleon and Snowball, two young boars, in the position of power. They revolt, due to Farmer Jones not feeding them, and invent a new system of government where all animals are equal, everyone can get an education, and everyone works for the common good.<br />Snowball and Napoleon are in conflict all the time, though, and Snowball gets run off while the animals are voting on whther to build a windmill or not. Napoleon and Squealer, his propaganda minister, slowly and steadily convince the animals that Snowball is a terrible, terrible pig and very cowardly, even though he was the best of the two, and all the animals that object are murdered. Napoleon makes deals with humans, but he gets cheated by one of the humans.<br />At the end, all the pigs, who had moved up to a position of power, and all the humans, who had debased themselves, all looked and acted exactly the same. The pigs even dressed up in people-clothes and paraded around on their hind legs.<br />The purpose of this book is to tell of the evils of Communism; it usually starts out okay, but eventually ends up in totalitarianism. (I did a book study on this). Old Major represents Karl Marx, Napoleon represents Stalin, Snowball=Lenin, and Farmer Jones the czar of Russia. When this book was published, people thought that it was ridiculous, but then when they figured out that it was about the Russian Revolution, everyone realized exactly how brilliant it really was. If you're interested in history or classics, I really recommend this.	2003-12-19

I really love the Star Wars movies, and this particular novel (Vector Prime) is especially interesting to me because I always wanted to know what happened to Han, Leia, and Luke. Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin are just as lovable as the other three, and they give the impression that they will be more gifted in the Force than even Luke is.<br />The book starts off with Leia, Mara Jade (Luke's wife), and Jaina were going on a diplomatic mission to one of two warring planets to meet with a rabble-rouser named Nom Anor who comes from an entirely different galaxy. Mara Jade has a REALLY bad disease; it breaks down the mollecular structure of a person and kills them usually within three days. Mara, however, has been fighting it using her Force abilities, and is just really, really weak and tired all the time. <br />So anyhow, about Nom Anor. He's one of the race of self-mutilating warmongers from a different galaxy who want to conquer our heroes' galaxy. They enlist one of their troops on a scientific base in Belkadan, and he completely transforms the planet into something that can't support human life as we know it. <br />At this time, Anakin and Han were on a planet trying to save it from a gravity well that was pulling down a moon into the atmosphere. They get off okay, but there's no way they could save Chewie... (sob, sob). The end is fast-paced, and there are a lot of fun and funny parts in between... I would definitely recommend this book to any die-hard Star Wars fan, or even just a casual fan of the movies.	2003-12-11

He forms a plot to marry Violet, the eldest, to get their money, but the plan is discovered and Violet fixes it so that the marriage was false. Olaf runs away with his cronies, and Violet, Klaus (the middle child) and Sunny (the youngest, who's only a baby and can't talk yet) go and live with another relative. <br />The Reptile Room: takes over where The Bad Beginning left off. The orphans are headed down Lousy Lane to go live with their scientist relative, Montgomery Montgomery.  He has a large house with a huge museum of reptiles (hence, THE REPTILE ROOM). Montgomery is actually nice to the orphans, and he says that they're all going on an expedition to a foreign country to look for reptiles. All of them are really excited, until the new helper-man that Montgomery hired named Stefano is discovered to be the evil Count Olaf. Olaf kills Montgomery, and the kids try and get their guardian, Mr. Poe, to understand that Stefano is a murderer. Everything ends up not-so-great, and Stefano runs away again with his cronies while the children go to a new relative's.<br />The Wide Window: takes place at Lake Lachrymose where the orphans have come to live with their widowed Aunt Josephine who's an incredible scaredy-cat. She's an fanatic about the English language, and she has to have perfect grammar. The orphans and Josephine meet a 'seafarer' named Captain Sham, who turns out to be Count Olaf (are we starting to see a pattern here?), and Aunt Josephine kind of develops a crush on him. The children try to warn her, but alas. Aunt Josephine runs away to a cave, and leaves the children a note with grammatical mistakes that tells where she is. The children go to find her, and sheis a COMPLETE wimp and eventually ends up in the lake and eaten by leeches. The children escape from Count Olaf's clutches (he'd tried to adopt them after Aunt Josephine had supposedly deserted them). Mr. Poe was oblivious to this, even after the kids had warned him. But, eventually, Olaf gets away adn the kids go off to another relative.<br />My opinion: One of the best things about these books are the pictures, because they're really funny and interesting to look at. Also, even though the plot stays mostly the same throughout every book, you never get tired of it, because everything is JUST SO FUNNY. If you were a kid fan of Harry Potter, I would definitely recommend this. Even if you were an adult fan, I think that you would get the hidden meanings and acronyms better than the kids do. All in all, this is a great series and definitely a must read!	2003-11-29

For example, Meg states in the first part that she wants to be like everyone else, and the place where her father is imprisoned is a planet where everyone does everything the same way, at the same time. (And if that's not weird enough for you, if they don't do everything the same exact way, they're given electro-shock therapy until they do.)<br />This is a very interesting book, and I recommend it to everyone.	2003-11-29

Rosie (as she's called by her new guardians, Aunt and Katriona) grows up kind-of tomboyish and can talk to animals. (By the way: the characterization of the animals is really great- a personality is created for each one.)<br />This book is so detailed that I can't even start to begin to tell everything about it- you'll just have to read it for yourself. The only thing that I didn't like was that towards the end it seemed a little unfair for Rosie when she decided to give up her crown, but still everything ended up turning out for good.<br />Final opinion: This is a wonderful book, and I recommend it to everyone.	2003-11-29

Very strange, but it gets a lot stranger and way more complicated.<br />I would recommend reading this book if you liked the movie, because it is interesting to see what's going on in the characters' heads while they're playing their parts. If you didn't like the movie, though, or if you haven't seen it, I wouldn't recommend reading this. <br />I would rate it PG-13 for the INCREDIBLE amount of cursing that happens and adult situations, but if you look past that, it's got a pretty decent plot.	2003-11-28

Zel's mother had had a craving for a special lettuce called rapunzel that the witch grew in her garden and persuaded her husband to steal some for her; in exchange, they were to give the witch the newborn baby.<br />One day at market, Zel met the prince, and they both fell in love. Zel's mother really didn't like this, and locked Zel up in a tower where only she could visit her. <br />This book I would recommend to teens, but not to young children because it has some adult situations. PG-13 would be an appropriate rating.<br />Final opinion: I think that this book was pretty good.	2003-11-28

This book has all the facts- everything date-wise and people-wise that you read in it is true, and you can check in other non-fiction biographies if you want to (Behind the Mask, a biography over Elizabeth, is a really good book to read if you become hooked on stories of her life). <br />This is really interesting, even for a fiction book; the story of her life reads like a drama from someone's head. Even if you think you know a lot about Henry VIII and his family, I still recommend this. If you just like to read, I recommend this, but it's more of a girl's book than a boy's book. <br />Read it, and you'll thank me!	2003-11-27

She dreams of becoming an Avatar, one of the rulers of the city, but is completely and totally surprised when her family chooses her cousin, Garun, to compete in the trials instead of herself. Things get even stranger when she discovers that the entire council is scheming to get Garun into the position as new Avatar. Nia's boyfriend, Cephan, is also in the running to become Avatar, but she fears that he doesn't have a chance. <br />This book is really wonderful fantasy/fiction, and this is probably the best mermaid book I've read lately. It's easy to read (and, especially if you're a speed reader, it's the right size and length :), and it's also very interesting and detailed. The entire story gets played out in the trilogy, and, let me tell you, if you hang in and finish all three books, you will think: 'Man, that's good.' And you have to read the books in order, because the first one kind of sets the stage, the second starts the conflict, and the third ends it and ties the ends that were floating around up. <br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone!	2003-11-27

Different.<br />This is about the youth of a girl named Mary Tudor whose father was the disreputable Henry VIII. Her mother was Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragorn. This is about the time of her life mainly from when Henry started getting interested in the lady that would succeed her mother, Anne Boleyn, to the time where Mary is crowned queen after her brother dies.<br />The great thing about this book is that you really get into the character's emotions and think of her life as more than history, but as someone who actually was alive and actually had to fight for everything she got; there was a time when the queen of England was treated like a servant and had to change the diapers of Elizabeth I.<br />This book really portrays a more lovable Mary because she hadn't started the persecuting of Protestants yet, and if you are really interested in English history I would definitely suggest for you to read this book!	2003-11-27

If you had any idea at all of Arturian legends, then you would have seen that Corwin was Merlin, and Nia was the Lady of the Lake, but it all tied in nicely in the end. (After you finish this book, I recommend reading The Return of the King by T.H. White if you're still interested in the Arthur legends.)<br />This book starts where the first book left off, when Nia and Corwin and the little Farworlder were about to go to Atlantis to defeat Ma'el. It's kind of predictable, but it's actually a very fun little book to read. Think about the world play in the sword's name... just to give you a hint.<br />I would recommend this book to any teenager, but probably girls would like it more than boys would.	2003-11-27

She has this dream one night of baby Jesus and Mary and Joseph- the entire Christmas story. She decides to present it to her father as a birthday present, and he gets REALLY ticked off, and says that HE's the best, and the greatest, etc.<br />The only kind of tense part is toward the end, where Matsu Suinin goes off into his yelling/screaming spiel about his supreme significance and hits one of Tenyin's sisters (the one who's deaf and mute). It stays 'G' rated throughout the entire thing, though, and I would definitely recommend this if you wanted to have something to perform for little elementary kids or for a family thing. It works out great for that- it has a really simple set.	2003-11-27

It's BETTER.<br />This book is about a regular New York City gal named Mia Thermopolis who, one day, discovers that her father, the current ruler of Genovia, has had cancer and can't have any children anymore. Thus, she has to do the whole princess spiel.<br />Her reaction:<BR>   1. My dad owns a country???<BR>   2. I CAN'T BE A PRINCESS!<br />This is hilarious, from the very beginning to the very end. For one instance: Lilly, Mia's best friend, has a cable show and a stalker, who keeps calling her and sending her things, and just says to take her shoes off. Very strange.<br />I recommend this to everyone who likes to laugh- maybe boys will even like it more than girls do :)	2003-11-27

That one's one of the best ghost stories I've every read, mainly because it gets away from the norm so much; for one thing the ghost isn't a centuries-old ghost, it's a really new one. Plus, the ending will REALLY freak you out. It is SO creepy. \\"October Chill\\" is pretty good, too- it's about a girl that has cancer that befriends a ghost. <BR>    I think that everyone should read this book, and if you're a fan of ghost stories, it's a definite must.	2003-11-27

If you want to know more about English history, this is definitely a great place to start. <br />This is the best biography on Elizabeth I that I've read so far, and it has pictures of the portraits that she appeared in in her life. And you'll learn pretty much everything you ever wanted to know about Elizabeth the First- from what her three nicknames were (Gloriana, Good Queen Bess, and the Virgin Queen) to the last lie that she every told her sister, Mary.<br />This is a great book, and I recommend it to everyone!	2003-11-27

So she goes up onto the human world and meets a boy named Corwin.<br />Corwin had found the shell containing the young Farworlder, and had also been infected by him, but King Vortigern's sons had stolen the shell and brought it back to their father.

This was an okay book, I guess, but I didn't like it very much- it seems like it would be more suited to be read by boys than by girls.<br />The characters didn't seem to be very substantial- you learned more about the Buddhist religion and achieving Nirvana than about the main character himself, Siddhartha.<br />Siddhartha is the son of a Brahmin, and is big and smart and is expected to be a holy man. He decides he wants to be a Samana (a kind of holy beggar that searches for inner peace in harsh conditions), though, and goes off. His travels lead him to a Buddha, then on the earth, that tries to teach to other people. His best friend joins with the Buddha, named Gotama, and Siddhartha decides that he does not need to be taught- he needs to teach himself.<br />He walks on, and somes to a village where he gets rich in the merchant business, is befriended by a courtesan, Kamala (who seems quite stupid, and is pretty much the only girl in the book), and gets for the most part un-enlightened.<br />He realizes his mistake, though, eventually, after twenty years and goes and finds inner peace from the old ferry man who rafts down the river. His son that he had with Kamala is left with him after Kamala dies from a snake bite, and then his son runs away.<br />His old friend that joined the Buddha, who later died, finds him rafting down the river on the ferry and thinks he's kind of crazy at first. Then he realizes that Siddhartha has actually found enlightenment, and is in awe.<br />Like I said, I don't really like this book. I might if the plot was a bit more complex, but this is, in all essence of the words, just the bare facts of the life of Siddhartha, who later became Buddha.	2003-09-28

It has everything, and paints a perfect (and very, VERY descriptive) picture of Paris in the 1820s-1830s. Even though it is really quite long, you never have to wait very much for something to happen- and everyone in the book is connected with everyone else.<br />If you can understand French, then this book would probably be even better, because it has a lot of songs and poems in French, including the last few lines of the book.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't afraid to read a longish book- it isn't even that hard to read, because once you get into it, everything is really simple because it's so close (for the most part) to life today.<br />Happy Reading!	2003-09-28

So much has happened (they talk about a little of it in the book) and they also talk about how they feel about moving on to the new step... and, unfortunately, we won't be there to witness them.<br />But (and at the end it says this) they won't be best friends forever... they'll just be friends. And I personally don't want to see the end of the friendship...<br />The book is emotional, touching, and funny, and I'm not going to say anything else because you just have to read it for yourself. So much is mentioned, and a lot of stuff you have to find out as you read... this is probably in my top ten books of all time.	2003-08-03

She decides to throw a going away party with some of his students and teachers at SMS.<br />Here's where it gets REALLY interesting... at this party, Toby (the guy Stacey met at Sea City and kissed, which was her first kiss ever), Sam (Kristy's brother that goes to high school that Stacey went out with for awhile), Pete (another boyfriend), Robert (the boyfriend that Stacey had before Ethan and turned really needy all of a sudden), Wes (Stacey's huge student-teacher crush-ee), Ethan (Stacey's most current ex-boyfriend that is fifteen and lives in New York), and Jeremy (Stacey's current boyfriend) ALL ARE THERE.<br />Okay, so the plot is completely crazy (what thirteen year old girl has accumulated that many boyfriends?) and all are appearing after long absences on that one particular Saturday, but all in all it's a fun book!	2003-07-31

New things are happening with every single one of the baby-sitters (the author brought the members of the club down to the original four people), and problems that they experience are getting to be more teenage, not just problems with baby-sitting charges. Here's what's happening with ther fantastic four:<br />Kristy: is worrying big time about what is going to happen with the Baby-sitters Club as they get older and afraid that she and all her friends will drift apart in high school.<br />Mary Anne: is getting over the fire a little, and thinking about being her own person, not just the person her dad or Logan want her to be. She starts to think that Logan is smothering her.<br />Claudia: is on a trip to a \\"deserted\\" island with her family, and gets back to the simple life and finds that she likes it a lot.<br />Stacey: is having difficulties with her father- he doesn't like Ethan and thinks that Stacey is seeing too much of him, and he is thinking about moving in with his girlfriend who he has been seeing for a long time. Stacey doesn't like the idea of that.<br />This is a great book, and seems to focus on the situations that teenagers face when they start to head out of middle school and start to head into high school.

In this book (number 4), you see the huge fight with Claudia and Stacey in Claudia's point of view (just so you know- if you aggreed with Stacey in book #2, you'll probably change your opinion). <br />Claudia gets a new friend- her name is Erica. (In the last book, Stacey became friends with Claudia's old enemy, Rachel.) Stacey also gets WAY more over-protective with Jeremy when he starts hanging out with Claudia more. Mary Anne is still kind of sad about breaking up with Logan, especially when she sees him noticing other girls.<br />My thoughts on this book: I thought it was great! I'd read the Stacey version of \\"the fight\\" earlier, and it makes you see \\"the fight\\" in a totally different perspective. As always, the book was fun to read, well-written, and kept true to Claudia-the-character... though Stacey DID seem to be quite a bit more mean than usual. All in all- a great book!	2003-07-31

The school nominated categories are being updated this year- so in addition to all the categories like best dressed and most likely to succeed, they have other categories like Most Artistic and Most Likely to Be Seen in Hollywood. Cokie, unfortunately, sabotages the votes so that she and her friends will get all the categories to themselves. Mary Anne and Abby figure this out, though, and go to the vice-principal to get a recount.<br />Cokie, furious (as always), spreads a rumor around the school that Mary Anne begged Logan to take her back, sending him e-mail messages and hundreds of messages on his answering machines. Logan, reportedly, had said 'no, there is another girl, and I don't like you any more'. This isn't true, and Mary Anne and the BSC get Cary Retlin to help them think up a way to pay her back just in time for the huge party that Cokie's throwing. <br />Mary Anne's dad grounds Mary Anne just before the party, so Mary Anne sneaks out and arrives there, where she tells the truth to Cokie once and for all- that Cokie's a brat that no one likes and that even though she thinks that telling lies about other people will make her seem cool, they don't. <br />Mary Anne finally gets over her nightmares, and learns that her dad had recently been experiencing the same flashbacks to the night of the fire.<br />A good book, and a lot more serious and realistic than the original BSC series.	2003-07-31

Kristy, students from SMS, and parents of the students go to a hearing to get Ted (the teacher's) job back. <br />My thoughts: I really liked this book- and that people stood up for what they believed in to \\"fight the power\\", so to speak, and used their right to protest.

The book is well-written, but the REASON for the fight is terrible. Why end a friendship over a guy that you've only known for a couple of days? Anyway...<br />This is in Stacey's point of view (you can see Claudia's in book number 4). This is also where Stacey meets Rachel, who becomes a really good friend but the other baby-sitters can't stand her. Stacey breaks up with Ethan, and things hit ANOTHER turning point in the BSC.<br />All in all, a pretty exciting book!	2003-07-29

The same characters from the movie are in it (Dorothy, Glinda, the Wizard of Oz) but don't be surprised if you notice a lot of details in the book that aren't in the movie- they're both completely different. The book is complicated , and contains a lot of elements that are magical in nature, not to mention all the different races (there's even one made out of china!). I don't think I'd recommend it to a smaller child, but eight, nine, ten year olds would LOVE it.	2003-07-24

When I first got this, I was a little skeptical, but they turned learning into learning in a fun way. As you complete lessons in your textbook (you can choose from a list that they have) you get a part of a story about Tommy and his supposed girlfriend. In the end, the story turns out to be a little... well, you can find out anyway.	2003-07-21
