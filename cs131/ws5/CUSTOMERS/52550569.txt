I went through an emotional catharsis after I read his book; I reexamined myself. Morrie put the emphasis on the little things in life; without your health, life is  nothing. By reading this book, I feel that I am a better person.	1999-12-04

I can't believe a male author could write from a female perspective as well as Bret did. My only objection to this novel was the use of the N word. I thought it was  unneccesary and felt it could have been avoided. Otherwise, it was great.	1999-12-04

I thought that there was going to be a climax of sorts; that something amazing or unexpected would happen; nothing did. I didn't like the way the author portrayed the characters. I thought  that the beginning of The Reader was good, but I didn't enjoy the ending.	1999-03-06

I would recommend this book.	1998-12-29

I must say, first  off, that it's easy wording and lyrical prose made it quite easy to  understand. I'm not sure yet, if I actually &quot;liked&quot; the book,  because it was only the first time I read it and usually the meaning  appears the second/third time. I think that I might go and get another  Steinback, because I certainly liked the way he wrote. Any suggestions,  email me:)<br />Melody	1998-10-13

To put it bluntly, this has to be one of my favorite  books. All of the characters were beautifully described, and with each  scene, the reader felt that they were there. I wish that the author could  realize how much joy he brought into our lives by writing it.	1998-10-03

I found Ben to be very funny, and the  historical lookback at Mendel himself was interesting and truthful. I  thought it was very clever with all of the genetical references (I myself  am dominant eyes, hair, and recessive hand (leftie)) I thought the writing  itself was philosophical and fresh. A good read<br />Melody	1998-09-02

I was required to read this book in 2nd grade,  and it still makes an impact on me. Imagine a day without math!!! We  couldn't survive without numbers. How would we tell time, eat breakfast, go  to work, or even relax? Everything in our society revolves around numbers.  Try reading this if you hate math, and you will be surprised at how much  math you really know.......I know I was.<br />Melody	1998-08-23

I found this book on Amazon, and it looked decent enough. But when I went home and began to read it, I foundthat was really nothing more than lists, LKists of books that the supposed biographee had read, music he liked, words he said before the age of two, mostly a collection of gibberish. The book had no glue holding the entire thing together and I even disregarded the entire middle section, because after reading the first section, I didn't care anymore about EDwin's life, and just wanted to see how he died. Even that was dissapointing. THis book was not a fluent read, the author of the book inside the book was first of all writing way to advanced for his age level and didn't seem to care what happened. I found this book to be boring and long, without anything holding it together. I wouldn't recommend it<br />Melody  GiggleMel@aol.com	1998-08-07

I think that towards the end though, her confidence did as well as her style. My teacher purchased this book for me because he thought I might enjoy it and that it presented a good lesson to learn. It did. I recommend this book to teenagers like myself to show that women can do anything!<br />Melody	1998-07-29

US	52550569	R28BGC1164C4MW	068484477X	709347155	Stones from the River	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Book didn't make sense	I read this book expecting an epic tale about saving people during WWII. I expected too much. Trudi Montag, the main character who tries to accept herself through others, didn't hold my attention and gave me a cold feeling throughout the book. She antagonites over somewhat petty things, but seems to not let them go, resulting in a slow, awkward book. Although Helgi tries to show the German population and how they were affected, I found the town and it's people to be overbearing at times. This book is a long one, and unless you like the author, I don't think it is worth reading !<br />Melody	1998-07-25

When I read She's Come Undone, I loved it, but the ending never really tied together. I loved the way that this one ended.

I am 13 year old, and I have never read anything more deep and profound. Every teen my age should be made to read this book in school, it will teach them what can happen when you tease someone and how their life will be. This book made me laugh, it made me cry, and I passed around copies to all my friends and teachers. Everyone should read She's Come Undone. I've just started his new book, and I cam't wait to finish it. Please email  me with any book suggestions that you have, I want to read more this summer.	1998-06-06
