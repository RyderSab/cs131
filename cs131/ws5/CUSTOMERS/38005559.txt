The concept is reasonably understandable, a uk publicist has a sure fire winning manuscript, who's author who wants anonimity, so installs in the authors place a writer who's willing to pretend to be the original writer so as to premote the book for the sales pitch to the USA. Sounds simple? No chance!<br /><br />Having already agreed, the surrogate author finds the book is not at all to his taste, and throws a wobbly!! The ensuing chaos is all you'd expect of a Tom Sharpe book, ranging from vast amounts of expletives, through to dialogue thats sharp, witty, and occasionally leaves you grasping for the dictionary. Its not Porterhouse Blue standards... but its still well worth a read.	2005-07-25

The relationship of Jesus with Mary, and the bloodline of Jesus both through his brothers and sisters, and through offspring of Mary's marriage to Jesus.<br /><br />The book claims to be a Stand Alone volume but in reality I would suggest certainly reading first one of the two books mentioned earlier, and also Barbara Thierings Jesus the Man. Without some background research this book hits you with a set of ideas which will quickly be dismissed by the casual reader concerning things like names relating to statuses, and how the same person is referred to under different names in different places, and how to know why they have undergone these name changes. It can be baffling to say the least, although a great example of how this still happens today is that a certain Joseph Ratzinger is now called Pope Benedict XVI.<br /><br />What it also does is expand on how and why Mary Magdalene's name was suppressed, and then repressed, and who stood to gain from this. The politics behind it, and that's exactly what it is, shows that even back through the centuries the people in power were skilled manipulators of what the masses were told.<br /><br />When it boils down to it, the bloodline theory is pretty much the same as many other theories about bloodlines, this version was given in the first book on this subject adequately enough, and the idea is used in the Da Vinci Code book which basically was a rewrite of the 2 books mentioned above. The break down of the artwork is also covered in a book exceptionally well called Tomb of God, by Richard Andrews and Paul Schellenberger.<br /><br />Having read many books on this subject I found this easy to read, mainly because it was just covering old ground for me, and it refreshed points I already knew. However, I say again, if your reading this coming straight from Dan Browns work of fiction, I think to get a better feel of what's being told here, to grasp that this story is purportedly factual, you may well need other materials to traverse the gap and break through the ideas that have been drilled into people from birth by a culture still manipulated by religion todayet a better feel of what's being told here, to grasp that this story is purportedly factual, you may well need other materials to traverse the gap and break through the ideas that have been drilled into people from birth by a culture still manipulated by religion today	2005-06-10

If you look through the reviews here you will see that many people here say this is as good as his others, but i fear the words \\"as good\\" should be substituted with the words \\"the same\\", and the word \\"others\\" replaced by \\"recent books\\". Unfortunatly though, the humour which made TP's earlier books entertaining seems to no longer be the focal point in afore mentioned recent books, which lets down the whole thing.<br /><br />What nowadays you have is a parallel and parody of the real world, in this case the decline of the postal system due to new technology, and a moralistic angle, this time where a one time bad guy can change, albeit utilising his bad guy brain to attain personal repentance and morality. And thats it.<br /><br />Its a shame really, as the scope for these type of books is massive, but with a fan base who will buy a book just because of the authors name, there is no real need to worry about the content anymore, but there does appear to be a drive to make sure  at least one hardback and one paperback come out a set amount of months apart.<br /><br />On the whole for new readers, they may well enjoy this. For readers who've read all of TPs offerings i can't help but think they will feel a sense of regret that the days of Rincewind and Weatherwax have passed, fallen into the abyss named marketing exploitation, and i wouldnt blame them for eyeing this offering with as much trepidation as say, one of Mr Dibblers sausages... onna stick!!	2005-05-26

This isn't a criticism of the story, it's an observation of the style, and I wonder if Neil Asher meant for it to be that way.<br /><br />I was reminded at times of some of the older Clive Barker works, which certainly isn't a bad thing either, and thinking about it, I read this book in almost the same mindset.<br /><br />What I would say is that, were this to have been my first book by Neil, I would have bought more and been pleasantly surprised by the next titles \\"ummph!\\" and drive, where as this being my third book it serves to consolidate that which I already knew, I like this kind of science fiction, and with Cowl sat waiting to be read, I am remaining a fan after this offering too.	2005-02-03

Quotes from people such as Byron and Rossetti, even accommodating certain lines from Casablanca, as well as art from people such as Klimt makes this a beautiful gift for either man or woman. Some quotes are touching, some funny, and all capture different aspects of the affection and warmth conveyed by the pursing of our lips and making a kind of sucking motion... which as the book tells us, should be done in contact with someone, otherwise you could just be calling a horse!

Not so here! Adult fiction of this kind is far too scarce and because of this both Gridlinked and the Skinner stand out from the mainstream Sci Fi and grasp the reader's attention.<br /><br />Neil's style has a Sergio Leone feel to it, another reviewer mentions grit, and that's spot on. You can place yourself into character of any of the protagonists too, which can only increase the reading pleasure and experience.<br /><br />To many times I've picked up a Sci Fi book and felt that it was aimed at the 13-18 age group and am left with the impression that book radiated vapidity and substance, but Gridlinked reminded me that there are books and writers out there that can cater for my escapism needs.

In fairness i would say its aimed more at 13-16 year old readers and the language reflects that, but it doesnt detract from the fact that the story is told well, and maintains a good level of interest. It reminded me of Stephen Lawhead books, which i would imagine most people would agree isnt a bad thing, and some would say just because it doesnt have metaphors which merit an \\"after the water-shed rating\\" its not just aimed at younger readers and thats so, but its just lacking that extra bite for my tastes.

And that's about it as regards the story.<br /><br />I get the impression that this was written more as an attempted exposure of the CIA's methods and a personal dig at the psychiatric profession rather than as a novel. The problem is, this is a work of fiction, and much like other subjects covered in books of fiction which are based on or around real situations, when a person comes across them in this context, it stays within this context, i.e. people reading this wont realise ultrasound and microwaves are used in modern mind control every day, simply because having read it in a novel it becomes \\"the stuff of novels\\".	2004-12-20

This is a collection of stories and chronologies spanning from Whence Time Began, through to the End of Days, and has all the ingredients which have made it a best seller world wide.<br /><br />You have kings and kidnapping, adultery and angels, and proof that one man Can make a difference! I suspect that in many years time when the DVD comes out complete with the extra gospels edited out at the council of Hippo in 393, and four alternative endings to coincide with the differing way things can be interpreted, one of which will no doubt include the original ending of the gospels in which there was no resurrection, just an empty tomb, it will break a fair few sales records across the globe.<br /><br />Certainly this book captures the imagination. Like every good book, the reader becomes involved with the text and it stirs their emotions to a point where it becomes possible to immerse yourself completely. It has developed quite a cult following all over the world, and the regularity of festivals which originate from biblical events is truly mind-blowing.<br /><br />Like a good film, it has also become extremely quotable, to the point where most people will know exactly what you are referring to after you've reeled off a few lines.<br /><br />The only real let down is the ending, where things descend into the realms of dungeons and dragons, and although the whole of the last book is pretty much agreed on by scholars to be a metaphor, it just takes away that area of believability which had been built up from the beginning, but... all in all, it makes for a read quite like no other you'll pick up for a very long time!	2004-11-29

I've become somewhat of a buff on this kind of subject, but there are always more theories to be explored and this book offers an angle which I have so far found to be unique.<br /><br />The author presents an idea that the New Testament is written in code, a code which is easily read to those who have seen \\"the light\\". To follow this, you'll probably need a pad handy to write down a list of who turns into who as things progress. For example, the name Gabriel is actually a title like a rank, to denote status, and therefore the \\"Gabriel\\" is not the same person in one story as it is in another, they are just in the same job, so to speak. I choose Gabriel as it is a name instantly recognisable as having been an \\"Angel\\", and he/she/it occurs in both testaments. People assume that as Gabriel is an Angel, this accounts for agelessness, and don't ask questions about the time-span. The theory here removes the immortal status while at the same time equating the earlier versions with the later on the grounds that they rank the same, and therefore possess the same powers. It's the position that's important, not the person in the role.<br /><br />Now, think of most of the characters in your new testament, and then apply this logic to them. Most of the names are Titles, not actual Christian names, and are therefore interchangeable between occupants of these titles! (Matthew becomes Levi being a name swap that people already know.) Things become a little confusing.<br /><br />Add to this, the coded way which these testaments are written and you may need to get a second pad handy for more notes. Anything prefixed with lines like \\"let he who has understanding\\" is usually a giveaway that the next part is meant for initiates only. Fortunately the author has pointed most of these out and has applied her \\"pesher\\" decoding system to them.<br /><br />All in all I was impressed. I was especially pleased with the idea of Revelation being an account of Jesus' activities after the crucifiction, which after all, is what the books title suggests its about, as I am already aware there were no accounts of a resurrection in the original gospel transcripts, which would make sense if an account was being written of \\"what happened next\\", in code, so as only the people it was aimed at could read it.<br /><br />If you are to combine this with the idea that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, and that this united the 12 tribes of Israel (Mary being of the tribe of Benjamin) thus truly making Jesus the King of the Jews, then genealogically and from a human point of view the \\"faith\\" aspect can be removed and ergo the story becomes much more palatable to a wider audience, as its the mysticism which can put people off! A great example of rationalising this is the Raising of Lazarus.<br /><br />With an open mind and a lot of time for cross referencing this book can be quite an eye opener. Just beware that the complexness of it all doesn't make you cast it aside in exasperation.l, is what the books title suggests its about, as I am already aware there were no accounts of a resurrection in the original gospel transcripts, which would make sense if an account was being written of \\"what happened next\\", in code, so as only the people it was aimed at could read it. <br />If you are to combine this with the idea that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, and that this united the 12 tribes of Israel (Mary being of the tribe of Benjamin) thus truly making Jesus the King of the Jews, then genealogically and from a human point of view the \\"faith\\" aspect can be removed and ergo the story becomes much more palatable to a wider audience, as its the mysticism which can put people off!

The idea of a negative imprint is clever. The idea that Leonardo could have achieved this is entertaining, and that doesn't mean it's not true either.<br /><br />With it being \\"established\\" that Leonardo was a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, this means irrespective of everything else he was involved in, the tie in with the Jesus mystery which the Priory is embroiled in is something to be aware of.<br /><br />Obviously its for the reader to draw their own conclusions, but like so many subjects that are often just \\"accepted on first hearing\\" as being correct, it always pays to see an alternate point of view! What's presented in this book is exactly that, and like a good complex equation it does add up, but then, just because 6 x 2 = 12, it doesn't mean that 3 x 4 can't give the same result!	2004-11-26

There are a few laughs, though not many, and there is a reasonable story, though not a gripping one.<br /><br />I think \\"Ok\\" sums up the book well! In the same way as sometimes you'll watch a TV program because it's on, it passes the time until something you're really waiting for comes on. Cameo appearances from Vimes and Anguna in the first few and last few pages may make a regular Pratchett reader pick this up hoping for the rest of the Men at Arms squad to be about. They'll be disappointed. The story itself is basically Girl dresses as boy to join army and find missing brother. And that's it. I have a vague notion that this was more of a dig at how women still feel they live in a men's world, rather than a comedy fiction novel. Shame really, as I was left feeling it achieved neither status.	2004-11-26

I enjoy this type of book! It creates questions, stimulates people into researching for themselves, and raises issues which show how we are still in an evolving society.<br /><br />When Lincoln Baigent and Leigh released Holy Blood Holy Grail many moons ago it created a storm. In comparison this book seemed to filter in without too much of a fuss, far less than the Dan Brown book which is still doing the rounds, but that shouldn't detract from the fact that this is a very good read indeed.<br /><br />Ascertations are made which certainly would make your standard \\"conditioned\\" catholic reader reach for the nearest holy water in an attempt to cleanse their hands after holding such heretical ideas in them! Not only is the idea of Mary, \\"Mother of God\\" being a virgin reputed, (it's a mis-translation), but Jesus was conceived out of wedlock, ergo James Jesus's brother had a good claim to the Davidic title of \\"the Christ\\"!<br /><br />The speculation of Jesus's marriage to Mary M is there too, along with the bloodline which flows through to the present day, with links to HRH Prince Michael of Albany, the man in direct line to the Scottish Crown, amongst many others.<br /><br />The fact that we know certain things were added to our common bible, (The earliest transcripts never even had a resurrection!), and that others which could have been included but were not, only adds to the mystery. Throw in the Priory of Sion, and an author cited in at least one article I've read to be a reptilian shape-shifter, and some geometrical code-breaking, and what you have is a book that commands your attention even if that attention is laced with scepticism throughout!	2004-11-25

It's not guided by some moral code the world imposes on us, nor is it subject to the same code when being read. It is individual's fantasies. Escapism, exploration of the mind where boundaries have no place. The reader is supposed to have reactions evoked, because some of what happens within a world of fantasy is so outside the real worlds acceptability that when looked at form the real world, it seems alien, and stimulates our ingrained sense of right or wrong. It gives an insight into the women who've contributed psyche, often how women as sexual beings have been repressed by the world around them, and unable or unwilling because of their confines to rebel in the real world, have conjured in their minds elaborate and amazing ways to escape mentally, which in turn, has enabled the conscious self to accept who they are, and apply their OWN morals and values to their lives, rather than ones given to them by their parents and religions and upbringing!

US	38005559	RXXUV9L6NAFO9	0061020664	260706411	Wyrd Sisters	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good for a chuckle	Highly enjoyable, very readable, and almost as god as Men at Arms... and thats saying something. If your a discword fan you'll love it, if your new, you'll most likely buy another, and if you hate it, I'll be suprised. Nuff Said!	2004-05-27
US	38005559	R3UIGEMV8E4LB0	031021792X	568293331	The Paradise War (Song of Albion, Volume 1)	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Good Time-Killer	With a lot of time on my hands these days and having this book and its follow-ups to hand, I thought why not give it a bash. In truth, the series is very readable, and you can picture both characters and environment reasonably well, and trundle through the chapters at a pace which pleases. The only problem I have is that it's just not very gritty. The language is all just a touch too antiseptic, and lacks believability. Having just been transported to another world, and a violent one at that, full of marauding semi-naked Celtic huntsmen, the contrast between new and old, (which consisted of nothing more exciting than wondering when exam results would arrive), would surely raise a few expletives from even the most sweet tongued well groomed young man?<br />That aside, and assuming that you like your fiction in this vein, you'll enjoy this offering. I guess its a bit like a bath... some people want to be invigorated by one, and others want to just lay and soak. Buy the trilogy and you can soak way 'till even your wrinkles have wrinkles.	2004-05-27
US	38005559	R2MB2G4RMLBGQV	0451409000	931515590	Messiah	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Well worth a look	Not one to normally follow the rules, I saw this books cover, liked it, so bought it. Impulsive maybe, but it was an inspired choice. Enjoyable from start to finish its dark, exciting, it makes for compulsive reading. The plot is cleverly constructed, keeping the reader caught up in the story, watching for the next twist yet still managing to spring a few surprises. Having never heard of Boris Starling before, the best recommendation I can give is that once I finished Messiah, I went and bought another of his titles. While doing so, I ran across a new copy of Messiah, complete with a new cover which was far less eye-catching than the original. Were I to apply a moral to the review, I guess it'd have to be.. It's what's on the inside that counts!	2004-04-26
US	38005559	R2JI6WSCIPNXH	0330484346	28420492	The Skinner (Spatterjay, Book 1)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Great Fun	One of the best Sci-Fi books I've read in a long time.<br />Written in a style that will appeal to many types of reader, it has aspects of Clive Barkers ability to create a believable environment, amalgamated with an easy readability which reminds me of excitedly reading old Spiderman comics!<br />The reader learns about the characters, rather than is told about them, a subtlety I enjoyed noticing, almost as if the people you were reading about were dependant on you reading more for them to evolve.<br />The language is strong and believable, and a dark humour runs throughout the story which at times is Tarentino-esk. I can't fault this book at all. Well worth a read!	2004-04-19
US	38005559	R1PM5Y912JMVK3	0953881040	12874895	Tales from the Time Loop: The Most Comprehensive Expose of the Global Conspiracy Ever Written and All You Need to Know to Be Truly Free	Books	5	19	20	N	N	Very Good Indeed	Split into segments so as to bring new readers up to date with his previous books here we have yet another impressive offering. While Davids journey spiritually may be ridiculed by some for having been aided by certain substances which alter your level of consciousness, there is no detracting from the hard evidence he offers concerning world events, and how we as the general public are being manipulated.<br />Aside from this though, there is a much greater study of consciousness as a whole, the interconnectedness of all cognitive thoughts, and the &quot;physical&quot; world in which we live in. There is much to be taken from this book in so many areas, all referenced, cross referenced and correlated into a shape that flows freely while still remaining true to Davids style and cutting wit. I have nothing but admiration for the way this is written, and would expect that, if this is your first Icke book, you'll be inspired to buy more. If your a fan already, there's enough here to keep you that way.	2004-04-19
US	38005559	RAC2I5PELPSRG	184149058X	434953011	Nothing But Blue Skies	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Not for me	Recommended by friends who know my affection for Robert Rankin books I was expecting something similar, if a little less surreal. I was disappointed. Very put-able down-able, sporadically funny but not enough to make up for the lack of flow, I got the impression the author wrote this when he had nothing better to do. Maybe I picked the wrong book for my first Tom Holt, as were it more consistent in its humour, it would have been far more enjoyable.	2004-04-19

This soon changed. The story is a gentle tale, dealing with perceptions and friendship, loss and hope. Everyone who reads this book seems to take something different from it, be it adults or children. Katherine Woods's translation is the only one i have read, but i feel compelled to draw parallels to the Paulo Coelho book, The Alchemist, in that it is without doubt an inspirational read	2004-01-08
US	38005559	R1EDHSP26WXRA2	0751510114	508848818	Gridlock	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Clever and Funny	Very well written, much like some of the old audio / stand up, Ben is cutting, sharp, emotive, and provocative. The plot is probably a bit too close to the truth for the oil barons of this world, and the political aspect may well be the same. At times i was laughing out loud, at others i sat and thought ponderously, a  good mix from any book. Read and enjoy.	2004-01-06

I worry that this mans mind may one-day refuse to allow such outpourings, and in the style of Monty Pythons killer joke, send Robert Rankin to a higher plane than Earth! Its not happened yet, though i did see him in Coventry, so its possible its on the cards soon! Its a must for devoted fans, and an eye opener to anyone as yet not wise in the way of Rankin. I want to see a day where i can ask about Robert in a book store, and NOT get asked &quot;Dont you mean Ian Rankin&quot;!!	2004-01-06
US	38005559	R3138WJR4SHOV6	0754014975	430278994	Down Under (Windsor Selection)	Books	2	3	15	N	N	Unimpressed	Picked up this book after having heard it was funny, informative, and easy to read. Within the first few pages i became disillusioned! It's hard not to be really, when Mr Bryson refers to spiders as insects, and in his initial segment to point out &quot;some facts&quot;, states that Australia is a single island continent. I'd be curious as to which continent New Zealand belongs to then? Maybe Australasia ceased to be in the day he lost crossing the date line? Having spent over a quater of a year in Oz some of his comments managed to make me chuckle, especially regarding Red Back Spiders, but on the whole i was disappointed. At the price, i'm not inspired to buy another of his titles.	2004-01-06
US	38005559	RMU4294TEKX81	0953881024	423650867	Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Disconcerting	There are many things that worry me about this book, which is, i suspect, as it's intended. The information is presented in a way that when viewed, shows the massive flaws in the way the public have been told about what happened and who is to blame on 9/11. I read it cover to cover, and was amazed at the way the official atory under just a small amount of investigation fell apart at the seams.<br />I would strongly recommend people read this book, if only to show how we as the general public can have our perceptions of whats happening in the world altered, or influenced, by information distributed by sources which can then be proved as incorrect. For example, out of the people named as hijackers, over a 3rd were found to be still alive! The infomation concerning the passport which miraculously survived intact and coincidentally just happened to belong to a hijacker and was all over the news as conclusive proof as to the culprits, turned out to be false. Strange how that never made the news though.<br />We all have the worlds media views of what happened that day drilled into our brain. 2 years on, i say again, read this book, then i'd suggest you re-think what you thought you knew.	2003-12-08
US	38005559	RJDU04CZX7X4M	0440136482	598516960	Holy Blood, Holy Grail	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Jesus, Myth and Legend, and a Secret Society to boot	I've just sat and read through the reviews of this book. What concerns me is that though it covers a subject like the Bible, which is designed specificaly for different people to extract different things from, the people who have read Hold Blood Holy Grail seem unable to afford the same curtesy to this book too.<br />In my own opinion, the book is exceptionaly well written, and opens up an approach to Christianity that allows people to relate to Jesus as a man, and removes a lot of the &quot;hokus pokus&quot; which deters people from beliving your standard tales of miracles and magic.<br />The basic plot, and i use that word with good reason, reguards a preists riseing wealth, which appears to be related to some occult knowledge discovered by accident in  the shape of some parchments. This information pertains to a secret, which has been carried by generations by a society known as the Priory de Sion, and claims to change the face of christianity as we now know it. The book carrys through analysis of what this information is, and how the society is prominent throughout the centuries.<br />The conclusions the book comes to will no doubt be rubbished by people who have closed minds to endings that are different to the normal ideas, but people are already disillusioned by biblical explanations of Christ, and are searching for truths which they can relate to. It is everybodys privelege to believe what they want to, and that adage applies here.<br />In summary, buy the book. Once you pick it up, you wont put it down. That alone suggests it captures the imagination, and maybe will change your perceptions on past, present, and future.<br />Other suggested reading would be...Bloodline of the Holy Grail : The Hidden Lineage of Jesus Revealed by Laurence Gardner, and The Tomb of God : The Body of Jesus and the Solution to a 2,000-Year-Old Mystery by Richard. Andrews, Paul Schellenberger<br />Apologies for poor spelling.	2002-02-10
US	38005559	R1FERBO9M8YNUJ	0552138339	32878088	Raiders of the Lost Car Park	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Classic Rankin	This book contains everything which is to be expected. There is a humour not found in any other writer, which floats through the story like a log on a fast flowing stream. The lead charactors are obviously mad, the philosophies of Hugo Rune strangely persuasive, and there's an obnoxious Campbell! It's a sardonic sort of wit, but make no mistake, you will relate to the humour. If this is the first book you read by Rankin, you'll buy more.	2002-01-22
