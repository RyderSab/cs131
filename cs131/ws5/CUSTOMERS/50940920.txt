I should probably stay away from 'mouse-like' heroine from now on because I just did not like Nora at all.  She seems so spinless to me.  Chirstian is no better - jumping to all the wrong conclusions without even investigating any of the possibilities.  I was totally disgusted by the way he treated Nora espcially with other women.  I have a real dislike for that type of childlish behavior. The story has a pretty simple plot with mouse-spy daring to save the kingdom and misunderstood by lover-husband as traitor.  The way that Christian had to climb back to grace was touching, but I think that is too little, too late after what he put Nora through.	2000-11-08

Their relationship was funny through  out the book.  I like the personality and chemistry between the hero and  heroine.<br />The fact that the hero is getting old and dealing with becoming  middle age is also rather refreshing, certainly I have not read that in  another novel.  Kate was really practical and strong which I enjoy very  much in a female lead.  Throwing in the Isabel's wild behavior, you have a  really nice romance.<br />The mystery is not really interesting, after all we  are not reading for the mystery plot.

The girl (I  mean 'girl') in the story was just as wild as the daughter in this story  and definitely needed help.	2000-07-18

I was expecting to be hooked on this book.  However that didn't happen for me.<br />Payton Dixon is a young girl who has been treated more like a young  boy on a ship with her brothers all her life.  She is totally infatuated  with Drake, a Ship Captin employed by her family.  Drake's brother dies  giving him a title and land.  Some how, he is to marry an terrible woman he  does not love and received a ship as wedding gift that Payton wanted.<br />All  right, so that is the skeleton of the story.  I never got to like Drake  through out the story.  I thought Payton's brother had potentials: they  were a little out of hand.  I think Drake's intention to marry that awful  woman throughout half of the book just really made me mad.  He was being so  stupid about the whole thing.  How can someone who is suppose to be a smart  sea captin be so stupid and not see through the marriage deal at  all?<br />Payton was really quite shameful through out the book in her  intention to chase Drake.  I did not grow to like her or identify with her  in any way.  She was so in love with Drake that she was willing to put up  with anything and everything.  Some of the things she did in the beginning  were quite funny, but they got really old by the end of the book when she  was still being extremely stubborn and silly.<br />I am going to move on to  the next Patricia Cobat book and hope that the next one would be better  than this one.	2000-07-18

The book has a refreshing start with an interesting plot.  Lily who translates complicated messages for the war department acts like a typical flirts during all the  parties.  Her acting career which can be quite funny throughout different  parts of the book is at risk when she faces her 'crush' Miles.  They  quickly realize at least the physcial attraction between the two of them.   The description of Miles, the Duke of Remmington is quite exciting in the  beginning.  However, he did not grow on me as the story went on.  All the  secondary characters are interesting and have potential for their own  stories. Although Lily is depicted as very intelligent and quick wit, her  lack of understanding of the relationship between the sexes were a little  annoying at times, espcially during the wedding night.  You would think by  then she would have figure it out?  Miles did not really develop much  throughout the story.  His experience and background and its effect on his  personality was not really explained.  One thing that was a little  disappointing was the way Lily handled or did not handled the distant  situation after their marriage.  It would seem that for a strong heroine,  she would certainly have taken things into her own hands and show Miles a  thing or two about 'Love'... Still, this book was a very pleasant read for  a hot afternoon.	2000-07-10

Although the  Warlord did not have humor, it was nevertheless an exciting romance story  with two dramatically opposit characters. Kenric (love the name) being big,  dark, serious, and brutal at times; Tess being soft, petit, and loving.   The book is well-written and attraction believable.

Her determination to  restore and build the castle added many fun moments to the book including  the gang of people she collected. The hero's secret and determination to  help her is really heart warming.  It is funny to read sections of the book  when she is actually bad-mouthing him in front of him...

The story about Alexandra's parents &amp; background is also very  interesting.  I kept looking for signs of her brother and sister in the  book.

Since this was one of the last ones I haven't read, I was certainly trying to enjoy it.  The characters were all full of potentials with Lucas's dark past, Taylor's fearful  childhood, Hunter's interesting background and friendship with Lucas, and a  whole cast of other interesting characters who Lucas and Taylor met along  the way of their story.  However, it didn't all come together like the  other Julie Garwood books.<br />The story and scenes seemed fragmented and  several things were not well explained in the book.  The unresolved  business with Lucas past still felt unresolved at the end of the book.  There were no climax in the story as to how Lucas and Taylor resolved their  relationship.<br />I felt the story had a lot of potential, but never fully  explored.  I wanted to love Lucas and Taylor, but didn't quite get there.  Well, I am just going to have to wait for another Garwood book to match the  Prize, Ransom, Secret, Bride... etc.	2000-04-07

I enjoyed the character of 'Vane' in Devil's Bride and decided to pick up the book with Vane's story.  Although he is still very bit as attractive, he somehow lacked the excitment of a hero in this story.  I failed to  understand how the two of them felt in love.  The relationship between the  hero and heroine were not well developed leaving me only understanding the  lust between the two.<br />The story moved so so slowly starting from the  middle.

Mel and Wil were very funny together.

Her brother  and grandfather both wanted Wil to stay marry to her and tame her to  stopping bossing every one around.  It was quite touching and funny at the  same time to see Mel pretending to be blind (after she recovered) in order  to stay with Wil.  The only minor complaint I have is that the hero and  heroine did not discuss how they feel about each other at all even after  they freely acted as husband and wife.  He kept thinking she looked down at  hims and wanted to leave; and she kept thinking he was not attracted to her  and wanted her to leave.  Otherwise, a fun read any time.	2000-03-21

I decided to purchase this  book based on other reviewers comments.  It is probably me, but I just  couldn't feel for Coco in this story.  Her descriptions were okay, but it  did not convey sympathy for her situation.  Her vagueness throughout the  story got to me quite annoying after a while with her being so  aloof.<br />James was a nice enough fellow, I suppose... but he came across  young and silly at times.  There were certainly scenes of nicely written  sexual tension, but the story got so slow in the middle and second half, I  had to skip through to flow through the plot.  I again realize that for a  Romance novel to capture me, there needs to be a certain amount of humor  and witty dialouge is definitely a requirement.  I did not find either in  this story.<br />The ending was a pretty quick wrap up for the long drawn out  relationship struggle. If you like slow moving relationship story with  detailed descriptions of the characters thought process (lots of thinking  in the head stuff), then this is the book for you.  Although I must commend  the author for pairing up a younger man with an older woman.  You don't  see/read that every day.  It could have been more fun using Coco's charm  and experience, but she came across sounding pathetic, sad, depressed, and  no fun at all.	2000-03-20

I am a great fan of Ms. Garwood's books and this book is no exception.  I am a little bothered that one of the previous reviewer 'snoopy1025' impacted the rating twice.  I believe everyone is entitled to her opinion,  however, the review lacked any content to describe why she thought the book  was a waste of time and boring.<br />Never mind that... This book again is in  the tradition Julie Garwood style with strong, big hero and petite heroine.   I enjoyed it every bit as much as Honor's Splendor, The Bride, The Prize,  and Ransom.  The most interesting thing about this story is that Elizabeth  and Geoffrey actually yell opening at each all through out the book.  It is  refreshing to see a couple who are willing to fight publically and shout if  they wanted to.  The hero had all these rules since he did not  understanding nor experience any loving relationship from his past, while  Elizabeth had an untraditional upbring by her parents and specially her  grandfather.<br />There were lots of teasing and humor in the book which is  another of Ms. Garwood's talent.  Of course let's not forget the great love  scenes between the two hot-blooded characters.  Well, enough said about the  story which I think you will all enjoy.

Anyway, this story is  written at a beautiful pace with just enough amount of humor.  I love the  heroine's fighter instinct and temper and the hero's calm and patience.<br />I  especially love the humor in Royce's need to lecture and Nicolaa's way of  tunning him out.  He does not even know he love to lecture and that she day  dreams when he is doing that.  There are a log of touching scenes in this  book.  What Royce did to help Nicolaa's brother was really touching.  In  addition, his determination to repair the chess piece was both funny and  loving...

I have to admit that this book, like most of Ms. Garwood's books have very similar characters.  Her  perference of 'huge' and outwardly grumpy hero and small and femine heroine are evident once again in this book.  However,  this book is still exciting, fun, loving and beautifully written.  Through  reading the book, you see the transformation of Lady Johanna from a timid,  scared girl into a courage, smart young woman.  Her suffering at the hands  of her ex-husband and ex-priest was extremely sad and painful to read.   Gabriel is the biggest teddy bear among all of Ms. Garwood's heros.  He was  allowed to believe that he is in total control of the marriage all  throughout the book which created a lot of funny circumstances. All of the  supporting characters, brother, first-in-commands, son.. etc are all well  written and had great personalities.  I also love the scenes related to how  the clan tried to please Johanna and behave themselves.  This is a great  book... the storey is cohensive and moved along at a good pace.  It is  always refreshing to read a romance novel that the hero and heroine are not  consistently misunderstanding each other and at each other's throat.  Their  acceptance of their marriage and great sex is also great in the story.  If  you have never read a Garwood book, this one you should definitely pick up.	2000-03-10

Sabastian had some of the most  erotic/exciting lines in this book.  The hero and heroine were a little  hard for me to get to love since he was such a horrible criminal most of  the book and she was so up tight about so many things.  I hate the parts  that Sabastian insists on marrying Prudence's aunt even though they know  they belong with each other (sort of).  The love tension between the two  were well depicted, but I agreed with the last reviewer that there were too  many lies.  Each of them were trying to do what they thought were best for  the other by lying, druging, or something else.  Can we have a little  honesty?

Although most of the romance novels depict two people with opposit personally, it is refreshing to read a novel that the  two characters can chanllenge each other in most ways.  Caroline and Jered  had more in common than other heros and heroines.  I would have love more  of a plot twist from the event Caroline witness when she was young.  The  prologue was very dramatic and the story did not seem to explain the  subsequent events sufficiently.  Caroline's relationships wither her  cousins are endearing and full of personalities.

This is my second Julia London book and I like this much better than Wicked Angel.  There were too tormet in that one for my taste.  This book is very well written and I love the relationship development between Abbey  and Michael after their stubborness leading to their immeidate marriage.   It was a little unrealistic and sad the way Abbey felt about Michael in the  beginning, but she was a quick study and realized the lies.  Their time  togehter were beautifully written and full of love.  Although I didn't  enjoy reading about his one visit to his lover, I suppose it was  unrealistic of me to assume that he would stop his activities just because  Abbey showed up.  My one issue with Abbey is that for being smart with  people and talented in many ways, she was terriblly stupid with Galen which  lead to the great one rift between the two lovers.  I really did not like  that fact that she resisted his love for so many weeks after her accident  and insisted that he was totally at fault without taking any responsibility  for her part in the deception.  Although Michael was horrible in the  beginning with his rude reactions to being forced into marriage, I did grow  to love his character.  I can not say the same thing about Abbey.  Overall,  it was a great love story with a huge misunderstanding.  I love all her  aunt/cousins.  It was well-written and not as heart twisting as the Wicked  Angel.	2000-03-06

He seemed sincere  and nice all through out the story even though Hen did not think so about  his supposed affair.  He was so sensitve and great when he pretended to  purchase dresses for his sisters in order to give Hen some new outfits. Hen  was full of spirit and fun in the beginning, but somehow she became a  little wimppy somewhere in the middle of the book.  I loved her frankness  all through out the book and can not believe that she insisted on not  confronting Dunford when she thought he was with another and went on  writing the letter.  That did not seemed like her at all.  The last section  of the book I really wanted to skip because I was looking forward to them  getting together to suffer another misunderstanding.  Overall, Minx is  still a good book, just skip the last section.	2000-03-06

Jessica from the Lord of the Scoundrels and now Lydia in this book.  She is full of purpose and independent.  Perhaps a little wild in the historical standard, but a great story character.  I  agree with the last reviewer about the secondry characters and loved the  appearance of Dain and Jessica.  Vere thought that he was helping Lydia,  but kept getting her mad by interferring with her activities.  The story is  fast paced withmany characters, I enjoyed that fact, however some readers  may find it choppy and fragmented.  I can't wait for another book from Ms.  Chase.  Bring us more incredible heroines!	2000-03-06

Very unique?   I don't know why but I didn't latch on to the story as I expected since it was so loved by all other reviewers.  I agree that it is  a refreshing change to see a hero not as dark, mean, rough person.  Mick  was a gentle person with a loving attitude.  However, perhaps I have a  problem with his profession as a ratcatcher that I just didn't fall in love  with him.  Edwina's is a strong and intelligent heroine, but her lack of  self-esteem on her appearance bothered me.  The book started well enough,  however, I found the middle section to be slow.  The roles of the twin  brothers were not well-defined and could have been more interesting.  The  revelation at the end of the book did not transition the characters well at  all.  I like the way Ms. Ivory wrote so I am going to try reading 'sleeping  beauty' next to see if it was just the characters I didn't like in this  book.	2000-03-02

I can't believe the heroine thought that her plan was actually a sound one.  With being discovered during several occasions already, she kept on her games.  She sounded reckless and silly with all her activities.  In  addition, her 'real' proper self didn't seem to be able to pull off all the  other more dangerous roles.  The cult described in the book was confusing  and stupid.  I certainly was not expecting to read about this type of dark  behavior in a romance novels... The hero was okay and I can't believe he  put up with chasing after the lunatic.  I also found it hard to believe  that she surrendered herself to him through that one dangerous moment of  being capture by someone else.  I think I may have to give up trying to  like Ms. Putney's books.  I tried reading several books without much  success in latching on the stories...	2000-03-02

I enjoyed Guardian Angel (the Story of Nathan's sister). She had lots of sponk!  The Castle (The story of Nathan's partner), she had a good head on  her shoulder, but Sara drove me crazy.  She was a cry-baby and came across  sounding dizzy and dumb all the time.  The times that she tried to gain her  'staff's respect reflected how silly she was.  It was understandable to  some degree that she had those accidents on the ship, but her reactions  afterward were pitiful.  Not only did Nathan wanted to strangle her... I  WANTED TO DO THAT MYSELF.  PLEASE... I tried to read with a sympathetic  point-of-view but found it difficult to get through.  I kept wondering what  was wrong with her .  Some reviewers thought her actions and reactions were  funny.  She just seemed plain stupid to me.  Nathan was a typical hero in  that rough on the outside, tender on the inside.  Although I do love Ms.  Garwood's book, sometimes I wish the hero wasn't SO BIG and the heroine so  small.  It gets a little redundant after the 5th book.  I still love the  Prize, Ransom, and the Secret.  I think Ransom is the best out of all of  them.  The bottom line is I got through the book but wanted to strangle  Sara...	2000-03-02

I thought the setup of the story was good with the abandoned/raped wife trying to seduce her own husbnad, but somehow I couldn't get through the courting and  deception part of the story when the heroine was in London being beautiful  and all.  I also found it odd that the hero would be so incrediblly upset  and resentful of her once he found out who she really was... I didn't get  that at all.  I skipped along the middle of the book to get to the end of  the story.  I threw the book a way after I was done.	2000-03-02

I plot was not that interesting, however the characters were fairly well described.  The story moved so so slowly it was painful to read  through.  There were hardly any romance between the two characters.   Perhaps friendship was developing, but love?  You would have to have a  microscope to look for it in this book.  Where is the adventure, fun, and  love in this book?	2000-03-02

Simon's childhood was so sad and his ability to overcome his difficulties was very touching.  Daphne is a great, caring person and beautiful inside not just  outside.  Her family is a riot.  The contrast between her family with  brothers, sisters, lots of verbal combat and Simon's non-existence family  is effective and dramatic. She helped to bring him into her family and  world... It was very touching.  Love the gossip columnist - have been  thinking about who she may be through out the novel.  Perhaps the  mysterious author will appear in the next novel also?	2000-02-28

I wasn't sure about this book since it is the first of her book I have read, bit I ended up staying up until 2 a.m. to finish the whole book in one sitting.  The book was fast-paced (can't stand the books that goes on  and on in describing scenes and depicting the inner thoughts of the  characters) and extremely funny.  However unreal some reviewers may think,  it is extremely entertaining.  For me, Romance novel is suppose to be  unreal and fun... and this one was.  Loved the part when Leah showed up at  Raven's house unexpected.  All the interactions in public were written with  lots of humor.  I laughed at Raven's reaction to his two friends - they  were both rather funny also.  The part that he tried to seduce Leah by  pretending to be a painter made me laugh.  Leah was strong and optimistic -  not a meek and whininig person.  Raven can be a bit much to take, but is  really touching in his own evil way.  Although the story is predictable  (aren't all romance novels?), I look forward to another from the author.	2000-02-28

Although they are predictable in general, they are great fun to read.  They are some suprising twists in this book that I specially enjoyed.  Jade is unusually exciting and her  protectiveness and honor is very touching.  The supporting characters are  all very interesting.  It was great to see a little bit of Lyon and  Christine from 'The Lion's Lady' in this book.  The identity of Pagen is a  great setup for the novel.  I won't tell you who it is... you will have to  ready it yourself.  However, my favorite Garwood so far is still 'Ransom'  but you might want to read 'the secret' before reading 'Ransom'.	2000-02-28

They read easily and floats through the pages effortlessly.  The Castle is another one that is well-written, although the story is not anything unusual.  Colin's  objection is marrying the Princess is really quite funny at times.  It is a  good romance with predictable plot.  I have also read 'guardian angel',  Colin's brother Caine's story - I like that a little better since it has  more surprises than this one, but still enjoyed it.	2000-02-28

The decision for Devil to marry Honoria seemed a little premature, but hay, it  is a romance novel.  I always love a good strong female in these novels.   It seemed to take a long time for them to figure out who did it even when  there were lots of hints about.  I thought the couple was not terribily  cleaver when they were trying to solve the mystery.  The love scence  between the two tend to be a little long-winded for my preference... I  enjoyed reading it, but am not sure if I would run out and buy another  novel ASAP.	2000-02-14

I picked the book based on the reviewers comments.  It is a well-written book full of tension and torment.  Although I love both Alex and Lauren, I was so tensed over the  over-bearning sense of duty and responsibility they each felt that I  couldn't really enjoy the book.  On one hand, the book kept me reading  until I finished it in one sitting, but  it really moved too slow for my  taste.  It has beautiful moments between the two of them, but lacked humor  throughout.  I agreed with one reviewer that it seemed to take the two such  a long time to get together that It almost forced me to skip pages.  I  thought the supporting characters could have been a little funnier to  balance off the desparate main plot.  If you the sort of reader who enjoys  lots of sexual tension, sad feeling of bad timing, a good cry... this would  be a book for you.	2000-02-14

I have looking for some easy romanace novels to read for my commute each morning on the train.  A friend of mine recommended MJP.  Dearly Beloved was highly recommended by all the reviewers and I thought I give it a try.   Although it seems like an exciting romance novel with detailed descriptions  and sexual tensions, I didn't find any humor or fun in this novel at all  which is one of my preference in casual reading.  It was torture for me to  try to get through the courtship between the leading charcaters and I was  lost in how I feel for Gervase and Diana.  I am sorry to say that I didn't  enjoy this book... I look forward to finding another author.  I typically  enjoy books by Amanda Quick, Julie Garwood, and Judith McNaught.	2000-02-08

I picked up Julie Garwood's book at the book store because of the cover design.  Frankly I refuse to buy any book with pictures of lovers on the cover since they don't usually represent what I imagine the characters to  be.  Would someone stop doing that for all great romance novels! No only is  this a heart-warming story between lovers, it had enough supporting roles  to keep you interested, laughing and guessing all the way to the end.  I do  love a good romance with great humor and dialogues.  It is a book to get  hook on. If you love this book, the Prize and the Bride are also very good.   Although their story is not as interested and involved as Ransom.  I think  I will read it again tonight.	2000-02-08

Beginning with the unusual circumstances bring the couple together.  The differences between the two leads are what make the story great.  A  great big, humorless knight amongst the people of Desire making perfume!    The wedding night and its aftermath is extremely funny.  I read it several  times to get all the funny lines.  The flower bin scene is also lovely and  funny.  Both situations caused our hero to break out in laughter which  alarmed his closest friends.  I would have loved to see Clare preganant  with his child at the end of the book.  Great fun to read!	2000-01-02

Although it may not be a tear jerker, it is really heart warming and funny.  Olympia is the type of lady I prefer in a romantic novel, smart,  opinionated, and fair.  Her commitment to her study is so much more  interesting than your typical soft, meek, beautiful lady.  It is really  funny how Jared is an outcast of his hot-blooded family is transformed  through the relationship with Olympia.  It is refreshing to find that the  couple is not fighting, hurt, or jealous of each other which seems to be  the theme of many romantic novels.  Although they may be very different in  their personalities, they are quite the charming couple.  Jared's father  and uncle were really amuzing contrast from him, while Olympia's nephews  added a lot of warmth to the story.  It was also funny when Olympia  realized Jared was a Viscount, but continued to boss him around as usual.   This is a light hearted novel and I truely enjoyed it one sunday.	2000-01-02

It is nice to know that not all love story requires the main characters to be gorgeous and handsome.  The story between Harriet and Gideon is GREAT!  She is so obsored in her study of fossils that some of the things she says  are extremely funny.  Her trust and loyalty to Gideon is heart-warming and  lovely.  The ways she defended him and his reputation is great with a hint  of humor.  Gideon is a victim of circumstances, but he makes a great match  for Harriet.  Her obession with the cave really makes the story flow  nicely.  I love the leading ladies in Amenda Quick's novel because they are  all strong, smart, and different.  Ms. Quick does not spend much time  describing their beauty and leave that to the imagination of her readers  which is what I prefer.  Another great one!  I also enjoyed Deception and  Desire.	2000-01-02

The relationship between Roman and Katie was not developed.  Their characters were not understood.  I did not get to enjoy any of the  great dialogue usually in her novels.

I enjoyed the  Orchard Ball a great deal especially when Cole saved Diana from the jewelry  auction.  Of course, it is unreal that someone with that much money can be  also young and handsome (we have to have something to dream about...)  I  wish there were more sections between Cole and Diana after they got  married.  Of all of the different authors I have read, I like the way  Judith writes her conversations the best.
