On one hand you have those would discredit science and replace it with a biased system full of pious presuppositions, and on the other hand those who would dismiss religion as not supported by the \\"facts\\" and thus irrelevant (and perhaps caused by a defective \\"god gene\\" that worked to make Pleistocene tribes more cohesive, but has little relation to the modern world.)<br /><br />I have to say in this context that I am most definitely impressed with the Dalai Lama's new book \\"The Universe in a Single Atom.\\"  This was written by a \\"simple monk\\" who has more understanding (despite his admitted failings in mathematics) of the basic questions than many theologians or scientists.  I may disagree with him in some parts of his arguments (especially in regard to some of his doubts about evolution), but I can not deny his basic openness and willingness to adapt his views as our understanding of the universe and life expands.  I only wish there were more like him! Science and religion probably should function as separate Magisteria (as argued by Stephan J. Gould), but they can have points of contact as long as one does not try to consume the other. The Dalai Lama states that some claims of religion (he speaks for Buddhism specifically) may have to be abandoned because of some modern findings of empirical science.  At the same time he feels that science should not dismiss religion as irreverent to human endeavor.  Science has little to tell us about how to live and religion has little to tell us about the exact details of the structure and development of the universe.<br /><br />This is simply speaking one of those rarities, a good book written by a \\"personality.\\"  But what a remarkable personality!  His understanding of the basic structure of philosophical and scientific arguments is astounding for a person who lived the early years of their life mostly in the remote mountain country of Tibet.  He articulates difficult concepts of space, time, physical law and biological science very well, while always prefacing his remarks with a humble phrase such as \\"As I understand it\\".  After a big dose of arid pronouncements by arrogant \\"personalities\\" in both Magisteria this is like a refreshing rain shower!<br /><br />I recommend that anyone interested in the intersection between religion and science read this book.  It is a major positive antidote for the \\"Conflict between Religion and Science\\" that seems to be the main media event of the day.  Not everyone is an unreasoning self-seeker.erson who lived the early years of their life mostly in the remote mountain country of Tibet.

The flowers are more noticed, except for some ornamental types like hollies.  Yet the fruit and/or seeds of plants are amazing structures, many evolved to be carried by the wind, floated on water, eaten by animals or inadvertently carried by same through the devices of spines or hooks.  In addition the seeds, surrounded by fleshy fruits or not, are little wonders- holding within them the promise of new growth.  It always amazes me a little when I plant a seed and in a few weeks or months I have in its place a tall corn plant or tomato!  Oaks are in acorns and tall pines in the seeds shed from their cones.<br /><br />The long lost manuscript of Henry David Thoreau has now been published as \\"Wild Fruits\\", edited by Bradley P. Dean and elegantly illustrated by Abigail Rorer.  It is a gem!  Thoreau recorded his observations and thoughts about every sort of fruit and seed he encountered in New England, including the domesticated or semi-domesticated types.  Occasionally he goes on about some favored fruit, such as the apple, explaining some of the folklore and history.  In essence, especially in this troubled world, it is a great pleasure to read about these amazing, but everyday, objects of nature.<br /><br />A good book to read and savor, I recommend it as an antidote to the hurried and harried lives we often live.	2005-09-30

Indeed, when compared with most revolutions, we in the United States were most fortunate in our founding fathers.  Not just Jefferson, but Washington, Adams, Maddison, Franklin and several others as well. However, all leaders have their warts and Jefferson had quite a few.  These included his view that blacks were inferior, his preference in maintaining his southern gentleman life style over freeing his slaves, his relationship with Sally Hemings, his tendency to relegate women to the hearth and his fiery temper and often unforgiving nature in political fights.  Despite all this he laid the foundation for a much broader view of civil rights and fortunately this broader view has taken hold, despite the fact that it is still not as good as it could be.  As a case in point, Thomas Jefferson's old position as Secretary of State (under Washington) is now held by a black woman!  Although we are not there yet, we have come a long ways!<br /><br />Still, Jefferson had a way with words, was a great architect, a fairly competent scientist, a voracious reader and a brilliant diplomat.  It is seldom that we come upon such talent and a few (if egregious) warts are probably to be expected, but of course should not be overlooked because of hero worship.<br /><br />The life, philosophy, triumphs and failings of our third president are concisely covered in a very readable manner by R. B. Bernstein in his book \\"Thomas Jefferson\\".  I think every American citizen should read this book, or something like it, in order to at least have some understanding of the beginning of our country and the principles on which it was founded.  It is somewhat comforting to note that the period of the early republic was often as turbulent as is our current time and that even great leaders like Washington, Maddison, Adams and Jefferson had their sometimes grievous faults and often disagreed among themselves over the best course of action.and that even great leaders like Washington, Maddison, Adams and Jefferson had their sometimes grievous faults and often disagreed among themselves over the best course of action.	2005-09-15

As a professional biologist who has specialized in arthropods, I could not agree more on this point.  Indeed, Lauck has brought together some most intriguing imagery and fascinating myths and metaphors into a discussion that I think was long overdue.  As a professional I constantly hear complaints from people about some harmless or nearly harmless arthropod, such as any spider, certain innocuous true bugs and beetles, or house centipedes that they think should be immediately wiped off the face of the earth.<br /><br />That said I think Lauck also makes some fairly serious blunders and depends too much on very questionable authority.  I find some of her supposedly true stories (such as bees visiting the grave of a dead bee keeper or people making pacts with Japanese beetles) to be pretty difficult to swallow and she is totally wrong on several \\"facts\\" about flies and arachnids.  One (perhaps minor, but none the less irritating) example is the old legend that male deer bot flies can fly hundreds of miles an hour.  This tall tale was based on a totally mistaken calculation made by C. H. Tyler Townsend, a late nineteenth and early twentieth Century entomologist, who guesstimated that to be a blur a male deer bot fly had to be traveling at least 500 mph!  In actuality they need only be flying no more than 35 mph! To be traveling at 500 mph, the bot flies would use up a huge amount of energy and the resulting turbulence would tear off their wings!  On a more serious note I am quite reluctant to give blood to mosquitoes (although I have given my share involuntarily to be sure!) and am also a bit leery about being too cavalier about mosquito-born diseases. Eventually we may make our peace with a parasite like the malarial plasmodium, but it is only after a period of adjustment during which many of us may suffer as much as the insects.  It is easy to contemplate these problems from a distance when one does not have to stand by the bed of a child dying from dengue, yellow fever or malaria!  As to friendly scorpions, I would be willing (and in fact have done so) to hold a big black Pandinus (Emperor) scorpion (which are pretty docile and not especially venomous), but definitively not a \\"death stalker\\" (Leiurus sp.) or fat-tailed scorpion (Androctonus spp.)  Only a fool would handle either of these two directly.  Encouraging anyone to hold such dangerous creatures is a very bad idea!<br /><br />I, indeed, would take the middle way (and I can only speak for myself in this).  I believe that one should not go out of ones way to do harm to other creatures and that deliberately killing another organism is excusable for only three reasons (one being very human).  The first is need for sustenance (including protecting food crops from pests, although not to the level of broad-spectrum pesticide use we have employed in the past)- I have heard that even the Delhi Lama eats meat every other day because of a metabolic problem.  The second is to protect oneself and others from disease or envenomation - at least some, if not most mosquitoes, ticks, lice and fleas, as well as some scorpions and spiders, may fall under this- Bubonic plague or dengue are not fun diseases to get and I am not going to wait around for them to become more benign!  The final reason I would grant (being a scientist) is to gain knowledge of the natural world, in part to help protect it in the long term and to maintain a body of knowledge that would help us understand the relationships and dynamics of the biota.  I would put some constraints on this activity- as organisms become better known I see them being more valuable alive than in a collection.  Thus most mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, marine mollusks and a few others, like butterflies, can currently be monitored without usually taking physical samples.  The eventual goal would be to eliminate the need for collecting, although this may take more time for some groups like beetles or higher flies.<br /><br />That said I admire Lauck for bringing the subject up and hope that some of her wonder and respect for the insect world would permeate society more than at present.  We need not kill every creature that causes us fear.  However, to discriminate properly in an all too imperfect world we need to arm ourselves with some knowledge.<br /><br />Read this book for some inspiration for ways to get along with the insect world (which as Lauck points out, is also our own), but also with a carefully critical eye.iles, fish, amphibians, marine mollusks and a few others, like butterflies, can currently be monitored without usually taking physical samples.

I could argue with the selections, but found them all of note and so would prefer more, rather than changing the ones Reid used in this book.<br /><br />I grew up along the other great southwestern river, the Colorado.  Both rivers originate in the Rocky Mountains and wind through canyons between mountains in the desert, one reaching the Gulf of California and the other the Gulf of Mexico.  Both have fascinating geology, biota and human history.  Reid is primarily concerned with the latter.  From the beginning of the river in the San Juan Mountains in Colorado to its mouth (if you can call it that) between the border cities of Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros, Mexico, he brings us samples of fiction and non-fiction about the great R&iacute;o de las Palmas, R&iacute;o Bravo del Norte or, as we Norte Americanos know it, the Rio Grande (pronounced \\" Rio Gran\\" in much of Texas).  Modern and relatively modern authors from John Nichols (\\"The Milagro Beanfield War\\") and Paul Horgan (\\"Great River\\") to Woody Guthrie (\\"Seeds of Man\\") and James Carlos Blake (\\"In the Rogue Blood\\") and older writings, such as John Reed's \\"Insurgent Mexico\\" (1914) and Robert T. Hill's \\"Running the Ca&ntilde;ons of the Rio Grande\\" (1901), all cast their spell and the spell of the land through which the Rio Grande travels, even if it is sometimes not as nice as we would like it to be.<br /><br />The most heart-rending chapter is \\"Ciudad de la Muerte\\" by Cecilia Balli.  This chapter is about the three hundred women murdered in the border city of Ju&aacute;rez,  over the last ten or so years.  As I live only about 50 miles north of the border between El Paso, Texas, and Ju&aacute;rez, Chihuahua, I have some personal interest in these monstrous crimes.  I am quite happy that we forbade our children to ever go across the border when they were in their teens, despite the fact that all of the victims so far have been Mexican and our kids were decidedly American. Also several teenagers who crossed the border (especially at night) have gotten into major trouble. I just don't trust the situation and Balli's essay really gets to the heart of that fear of the border city. Still, I have crossed the border on a number of occasions, but only a few times at Ju&aacute;rez.<br /><br />Despite all this the border lands and the Rio Grande have a rich history and culture.  Reid has caught this, but I still would like more.  Where is La Llorona, the wailing woman, who morns the children she allowed to drown in the river or the Confederate invasion up the Rio Grande of New Mexico in 1861?  Both center on the river and both have a lot of local color.  Still, I guess it is better to be left asking for more than wishing you had not read the book in question!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to gain some of the historical and literary flavor of this once great river, now polluted and tamed, squeezed, like the Colorado, of nearly every drop, before it finally reaches the salty waters of the Gulf of Mexico.e fact that all of the victims so far have been Mexican and our kids were decidedly American.

He tells the story of Buddhism between accounts of his travels in India, England, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States, weaving a coherent tale that does not spare the negatives, but also presents the positive aspects of Buddhist history.  Like other belief systems, Buddhism has been misused, misinterpreted and misapplied, sometimes in the service of quite evil goals, as in Japan's militarism in the 20th Century and in Cambodia's destruction of the city-dwellers during the Pol Pot regime.  That said Buddhism at its best is a very civilized religion (or philosophy, if you prefer.)  It has no gods, no real holy prophets (Buddha says that he is no greater than any of his followers and asserts that he is only \\"awake\\", not holy,) and its texts are considered teachings, not revelations.<br /><br />In its essence, Buddhism has a number of similarities to early Greek philosophy, but also was more egalitarian, including all sentient beings. The Buddha himself says that women, slaves, and untouchables are all capable of enlightenment, although like any other mortal he sometimes did not practice what he preached, especially in regard to women. Still he was among the first (if not the first at around 500 BCE) to recognize that women could be as good as men in the spiritual realm.<br /><br />Mishra has told this story with good humor, local color and skill.  This is no dry history of Buddhist theology, but a living and charming exposition of both reality (as much as we know it) and myth behind the modern rise in Buddhism.  Indeed, Buddhism's attraction lies both in its positive goal of compassion and the ending of human suffering and in its lack of the literalism that dogs other worldwide religions in their too often expressed extreme forms.  It is certainly refreshing not to hear absolutist rantings for a change (unfortunately the worst of the three revealed religions seems often to the forefront these days, between bombings, attempts to control national politics and laws and indeed, nihilist longings for the End Times!)<br /><br />Mishra is a native of the part of the world where the Buddha lived and it is also refreshing to read an account of the history of Buddhism from someone who has experience with the land out of which it arose, someone who knows it intimately.<br /><br />If you would get the essence of Buddhism, its history, geography, concepts, and failures and successes, this is definitely the book to read!vealed religions seems often to the forefront these days, between bombings, attempts to control national politics and laws and indeed, nihilist longings for the End Times!)

When I attended the University of Arizona there was a full blown course in embryology, both descriptive and experimental.  By the time I was a graduate student at the same institution the course had been rolled into Organismic Biology in which all of embryology was loaded into a third of a semester.  In essence developmental biology in relation to evolutionary studies gave way to molecular.  Still some pretty good work went on in the background that impinged on development and was to result in the discovery of HOX genes.  HOX genes (or homeotic genes) proved to be the \\"organizer\\" that was postulated by various experimental embryologists such as Spemann.  Even more astoundingly they proved to be pretty much the same, no matter which organism was being studied.  HOX genes in humans were essentially identical to those of insects!<br /><br />This remarkable fact offers proof for the idea that all life is related and that development is a key factor in evolution.  In \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\\" Sean B. Carroll explains the significance of such discoveries as the genetic \\"tool kit\\" (including HOX genes) on our understanding of evolution and of development.  Indeed, this is a fascinating story that has already caused me to rethink some of my understanding of evolutionary principles.<br /><br />We live in an amazing world in an amazing universe.  The genetic material made up of DNA is a very remarkable material.  What other materials could have developed huge numbers of organisms (as many as 30 million extant) that vary from zebras to sulfur bacteria?  Yet that complexity appears to have developed from a very simple beginning.<br /><br />Carroll was influenced by Steven J. Gould in his interest in biology, but he does not flinch from disagreeing with Gould about contingency.  Carroll says that if the tape of evolution were run again, pretty much the same thing would have happened.  I think that I may have to agree to a point (although not as far as Simon Conway Morris goes with it).  However, certain alterations in earth history might still have caused a radical change in the outcome, as in the development of a completely water covered planet or a very large asteroid strike (larger that the one that apparently killed the dinosaurs except birds). At the same time not all evolved faunas that developed in isolation from each other resemble each other exactly.  The marsupials of Australia, for example, had a number of forms similar to placental mammals.  However, there was no exact analog to the kangaroo outside of Australia or of hoofed animals in Australia (giant wombats don't have hooves).  I agree faunas can be similar, but not necessarily identical and that intelligent life may be inevitable, but may not necessarily have looked like us or even evolved from mammals.<br /><br />That said, evo-devo, as the evolutionary development researchers call it, has much to offer and it certainly cannot be dismissed.  This is an exciting time to be involved with evolutionary biology, despite the creationist (or more sophisticated \\"Intelligent Design\\") attack on the whole idea.<br /><br />This is an excellent introduction to the excitement of a continuing unfolding of evolutionary thought.

For that reason I gave it four stars, when I might have given it three.  For one thing (as noted by an earlier reviewer,) Berlinski's descriptions of G&ouml;del, Turing, von Neumann and other logicians and mathematicians are very good.  For another I have to admit that I sort of liked the digressions!  The story by \\"Irving\\" (I think that he means Isaac- the editing is somewhat uneven!) Bashevis Singer certainly had little to do with mathematics or algorithms, but it was an interesting discourse on the difficulties of argumentative logic!  Now if Berlinski had only followed his editor's advice and made the book flow better!  He certainly has the knowledge of his subject to do so. Perhaps algorithms require a unique mind to really understand them!  Perhaps he is in some way saying this, but he does beat around the bush a bit in the process!<br /><br />I do tend to agree with him about the difficulties in transferring human thought into mathematical formulae.  Mathematics can do a lot and it is possible that someone may find a way to develop such a perfect mathematical theory or description of the human brain, but I doubt it.  The same can be said of the universe itself.  That is the reason that there is some room for religion, even if it is not quite as grandiose a realm as early theologians might have thought. In addition I would worry that if such a theory is possible, humans could not be trusted with it.<br /><br />This book is worth reading for the scattered gems, although the average reader may have a bit of a time finding them! Still with some effort they can be found.they can be found.	2005-07-02

After all I have noted through my reading some parallels between the two in the development of perspective, use of space and other innovations in art. The art of the Renaissance and into the Classic periods can be shown to have acquired (and in some cases predated) physical knowledge. Indeed, Shlain does present some very interesting material and certainly offers some food for thought.  However I think he fails to make a really cogent connection between modern art (from Impressionism to the most modern art, except perhaps for Surrealism) and modern physics.  In fact many of his connections seem to me tenuous at best and in some cases a very big stretch.  As one reviewer said, I'm not sure how much the author really understands of either relativity or quantum theory.  How physics plays into the revolutions of Impressionism, Neo-impressionism, Fauvism or Cubism is a little hard to see, although obviously there are parallels in surrealism (especially with Relativity Theory.)  A more skilled and knowledgeable writer may have constructed a better argument, but I suspect it would also have been a much shorter book.<br /><br />I had serious difficulties in following some of the comparisons and many side trips seemed to lead nowhere, as in his discourse on Manet's paintings and physics.  I also do not know how seriously the reader can take the right brain/left brain dichotomies he discusses, as I believe the concept is way too simplistic.  Brain functions are more complex and difficult to separate than that and the right brain/left brain separation is more a pop culture myth than a scientific idea.<br /><br />If you wish you can read this book as a source of interesting ideas about art and physics, but do not take it too seriously in regard to absolute relationships between the two.	2005-06-23

US	52626966	R7105QRTU3V5R	0743242785	644676498	When the Mississippi Ran Backwards: Empire, Intrigue, Murder, and the New Madrid Earthquakes	Books	5	16	16	N	N	A Terrible Natural Disaster and Human Failings	Starting on December 16, 1811 and lasting into the calamitous year of 1812, a series of earthquakes leveled towns, settlements and Native American villages along the drainage of the Mississippi centered near New Madrid in what is now Missouri. This catastrophic series of quakes (at least three near or greater than 8.0 on the modern Richter scale) occurred during the land speculation and grabbing of the early 1800s and killed an untold number of people. The legendary \\"prediction\\" of the great Shawnee chief Tecumseh that he would stamp his foot and the earth would move if the tribes did not join him in an alliance against the whites had come true. This then set off a war fought within the American War of 1812 with Britain and continuing beyond it.  Indeed Tecumseh and his allies had much to grieve them, as unscrupulous land speculators and settlers took over Native American land with little or no payment and by dealing with tribes who often had no exclusive ownership of the land they sold.<br /><br />All of this turmoil and more are caught in \\"When the Mississippi Ran Backwards: Empire, Intrigue, Murder, and the New Madrid Earthquakes\\" by Jay Feldman.  Feldman has interwoven numerous threads of history that revolved around the great quakes, the most damaging, but least known, earthquakes in the history of the United States.  The account is full of interesting characters- Tecumseh of course, but also George Morgan (the founder of New Madrid), the evilly inclined James Wilkinson (who robbed everyone he could and held allegiance to no one but himself), the Prophet (Tecumseh's brother), William Henry Harrison (the \\"hero\\" of Tippecanoe and future President of the United States), Nicholas and Lydia Roosevelt (involved with Fulton and others in the development of the steamboat), John James Audubon (famous bird painter and naturalist), Andrew Jackson ( \\"hero\\" of the Creek War and future President of the United States) and many others.  In all this is a rich tapestry of history and natural events that set the stage for \\"manifest destiny\\", the Civil War and modern America.<br /><br />All of the people involved are vividly described and events show that Native American and people of European descent were both capable of horrible acts of barbarity.  However, Tecumseh stands out as a great leader (even begrudgingly noted by his nemesis William Henry Harrison), the Roosevelts as plucky and innovative (Lydia was pregnant and still traveled with her husband on the early steamboat New Orleans, actually giving birth just a month and a half before the great quake), Harrison as a scheming liar (correctly stated by Tecumseh, proving that a liar and thief could even then become President of the United States and that in fact a properly spun near Pyrrhic \\"victory\\" like Tippecanoe could make you popular enough to be elected to high office), and Jackson as destroyer of both Native American friend and foe alike (as it served his purposes).<br /><br />A good read and I think a necessary one for anyone who would understand our modern world and how we got here.tural events that set the stage for \\"manifest destiny\\", the Civil War and modern America.

During my time there I visited the Californian and northern Baja Californian sections of this huge hyperarid land.  I eventually moved to the less humid (if less hyperarid in terms of rainfall) city of Tucson, where I explored a considerable part of the eastern Arizonan part of the desert, as well as taking trips into the desert in southern Baja California and Sonora itself.  This is a fascinating land and one with great surprises, such as a fauna of fish and aquatic insects, desert crusts of cyanobacteria, tropical birds, army and leaf-cutting ants and strange plants.<br /><br />Now Steven J. Phillips and Patricia Comus of the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum have edited a neat guide to the area in \\"A Natural History of the Sonoran Desert\\".  The various sections contain numerous bits of information, many of which were new to me despite about 25 years of wandering in the Sonoran Desert. The discussions of the structure and history of the desert are particularly informative. This book should be in the bookshelf, and indeed in the knapsack (despite its size), of all travelers in this fantastic desert.<br /><br />I have to admit that I know five of the authors- namely Steve Prchal, Renee Lizotte, Gary Paul Nabhan, Carl A. Olson and Thomas Van Devender- excellent writers all- but I can also say that it is a worthwhile book based just on the work of writers whom I've never met and so I can claim some non-bias.<br /><br />To add to this praise I have a few very minor quibbles.  I wish that there had been more reference sections- certainly there are several books on the identification of desert plants, birds, mammals and fish! Also, as a jumping spider specialist I was disappointed that the quite readily seen red and black Apache jumping spider (Phidippus apacheanus), which appears to mimic velvet ants, was not mentioned (but then I am prejudiced!). Also not mentioned were the bright red velvet mites that emerge after desert rains (I get these brought to me all the time by people wanting to know what they are.) In addition, I could not find any reference in the index to tadpole shrimp- a very abundant inhabitant of desert temporary pools. I suppose that there was little room to add such in this already over 600 page work, but it is a pity, as I think they are of interest to the visitor. One other quibble is that I personally dislike the term \\"brown spider\\" as there are lots of \\"brown spiders\\"- including wolf spiders, some crab spiders, and many others.  I prefer \\"violin spider\\" as being more specifically descriptive, although I could never get W. J. Gertsch to agree with me on this (I believe that he is the original source  of this common name!)<br /><br />Having said this, I will reiterate that anybody who wants to have some idea of what they are seeing in the Sonoran Desert has to have this book! They can find no better guide on the market!after desert rains (I get these brought to me all the time by people wanting to know what they are.)

James McNeill Whistler is perhaps best known for his \\"Arrangement in Grey and Black\\", also known as \\"Whistler's Mother.\\" Except for art historians and perhaps some interested art collectors, his \\"Nocturne in Black and Gold\\" (which I like) is little known to the public. The furor that the later painting caused (including Whistler's suit against Ruskin over the latter's criticism of the work), seems odd to us now, but it nearly ruined Whistler, who won the suit but went bankrupt in the process. My own impression is that Ruskin was the biggest egotist in this contest, but both were pretty obnoxious. Whistler was famous during his lifetime for being arrogant and egotistical. However, at least he had something to be arrogant about- he was a genuinely great artist; an artist who influenced later artists such as Picasso, Rothko and probably Matisse.<br /><br />Ronald Anderson and Anne Koval have, in a meticulously researched book, given us a full account of Whistler and his times in \\"James McNeil Whistler: Beyond the Myth\\". Whistler's triumphs and failures, as well as his sometimes tragic personal life are all here. His wife's death from cancer was particularly touching and his devotion to her spoke well of him, despite his other faults.<br /><br />This is also a very interesting period in the history of art as Whistler went one way and Gauguin and Van Gough another in diverging from the impressionist's methods. Whatever can be said about Whistler, it must be noted that he had an impact on art and this is about as much as can be said for any artist. That he had major flaws is not contestable, but his great contribution to the development of modern art is (I think - as a somewhat informed layman) also not contestable.<br /><br />This is a good book for those interested in the development of modern art from Impressionism.  There are several other recent books on Whistler, which I have not read so I cannot compare them, however I recommend this book highly based on its own merits.	2005-06-10

His earlier books on paleontology were interesting, informative and well balanced.  He is without doubt one of the best science writers of the day.<br /><br />His most recent book, \\"Earth: An Intimate History\\" is a continuation of his exploration of earth history, this time centered on the physical aspects- earthquakes, volcanoes, continental drift, mountain building, etc. and Fortey's deep knowledge of the subject and unusual ability to explain it to the laymen makes it a pleasure to read.  This is a book to digest slowly and savor each bit of fascinating information served up to the reader on the (to us) most important planet of all.  Fortey expresses an intimate association with the geological strata and its evolution that is seldom found in books on geology.<br /><br />I was most struck with his exploration of deep time- the Archaean and the development of the first life on earth.  I don't think that I'll ever look at a piece of Precambrian gneiss in the same way ever again!  The shear age of such rocks (several billion years) is staggering and certainly worth contemplation. Geology puts our current all-consuming problems into some perspective!<br /><br />This is a must read for geology buffs, and I think all who have a reason to be interested in the Earth's ancient past history and possible future.	2005-06-06

We are in essence the most dangerous animal alive and of living things only microorganisms are able to cause as much or more havoc.  Island life forms are the most vulnerable to the human onslaught. Among our numerous disasters, the isolated biota of Australia and Tasmania has heavily felt the result of that attack. Many species are extinct and many more on the edge because of humans and their attendant placental associates like cats, foxes and rabbits.<br /><br />Margaret Mittelbach and Michael Crewdson, attended by their highly eccentric illustrator Alexis Rockman and his girl friend Dorothy Spears and occasionally others, including several Tasmanian inhabitants, became involved in their hunt for one of the victims of this human invasion, the supposed extinct Tasmanian tiger, and the result is a very eccentric and very interesting book \\"Carnivorous Nights: On the Trail of the Tasmanian Tiger.\\"<br /><br />I have to admit that the Tassie tiger intrigues me as well, ever since I saw an old photo of one yawning their impossibly wide yawn.  The somewhat dog-like body combined with tiger stripes and huge number of teeth (much like the opossum - its North American relative) makes it a charming animal, despite its reputation as a sheep-killer.  Supposedly the last one died in a zoo in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1936, but continued reports of sightings made the tiger legendary.  The authors (like some of the people they interview in Tasmania) become totally obsessed with looking for these elusive beasts (and who knows perhaps they will come back from the brink much like the recently rediscovered ivory-billed woodpecker!)  The resulting book is well worth the price of admission as it allows us into an almost unknown world of giant crayfish, potoroos, wombats and the very feisty and still extant Tasmanian devil.  In the end we are still left with the possibility of the tiger's existence, either in Tasmania or possibly the southern coast of Australia itself.  Perhaps it is gone... but then perhaps not.<br /><br />Unfortunately, finally the reader is left with the distinct perception that much of the wilderness of this part of the world and indeed other parts, including our own (wherever we live), is up for sale. The sign that that extols the value in board feed of a local native tree is a case in point. Many humans tend to know the price of everything and the value of nothing. Unless we change this we may become as dead as the Tasmanian tiger may be!<br /><br />This book is a good read and at least the reader will get an interesting tour of a very unfamiliar part of the world and its (to us) weird wildlife.of Australia itself.

Among these were J. Henri Fabre, Edwin Way Teal, Roger Tory Peterson, Raymond Ditmars and of course William Beebe.  All of these had their human failings certainly and Beebe was no exception.  He was often given to purple prose and hyperbole, his stories did not always match the truth and he sometimes claimed scientific value for acts that were more showmanship than real science.  Given all of these (I won't get into his personal life, which was not always admirable, but was his own business); Beebe had the ability to get young people especially interested in the often strange creatures that lived in the rainforest, on islands or the ocean.  In his writings he fed the imagination at times when life seemed especially perilous in the depression, World War II and the following Cold War. It was during the last (in 1962) that he died on the island of Trinidad at his research station at Simla. He will always be connected in my mind with the tropical forest and the exploration of the depth of the ocean in the Bathysphere. It is the latter that is the topic of the excellent \\"Descent: The Heroic Discovery of the Abyss\\" by Brad Matsen.<br /><br />The second man usually mentioned in any discussion of the Bathysphere is a young wealthy New Yorker named Otis Barton. Matsen mentions him first in this book and it is indeed appropriate that he did so. It was Barton who was instrumental in designing the Bathysphere and it was Barton who paid for it.  Beebe and Barton were in many ways rivals for the acclaim that exploration of the depth of the sea would bring, but they buried their acrimony because they needed each other in order to accomplish the task they had set - the descent into the abyss to the depth of a half mile.  Despite human flaws, petty jealousies, and oversized egos, the actual dives in the Bathysphere took nerve and I think true courage.  It was by no means certain that they would survive the event, despite their careful planning (as was evident by an unmanned descent that ended badly).  The story of their adventure, which set up later exploration by Barton, Piccard, and others, is gripping and well told in this book.  In it humans for the first time saw living deep sea creatures in all their glory, where as they had only known them from pale and dead or dying specimens brought up in nets from the depths. Whatever Beebe's or Barton's faults the reader can certainly sympathize with them as they view such wonders for the first time in human history!<br /><br />If you are at all excited by the exploration of our blue planet, you will find this book a great pleasure to read.would survive the event, despite their careful planning (as was evident by an unmanned descent that ended badly).

Around long enough to contribute significantly to the development of synthetic theory, Mayr made at least some of the history he reports on in his monumental \\"The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution and Inheritance.\\"  While any book of this scope is bound to have some blank spots, this is by far the most comprehensive history of biological thought ever published and it is fitting that it should get as much praise as it has.<br /><br />Mayr had his weak points (as all people do), but they were certainly not in depth of knowledge.  Starting as an ornithologist (he could identify the local birds around his home in Germany by the time he was ten) he built a solid reputation as an evolutionary biologist. He early on (correctly, I believe) took the view that the \\"nature-nurture\\" argument was not valid, as genes and environment can never be separated.  He is also the author of numerous quotable statements on the scientific method, biology and evolutionary thought, such as \\"...most scientific problems are far better understood by studying their history than their logic,\\" a statement he backs up in this huge tome.<br /><br />Indeed, Mayr is right; to understand scientific problems one needs to understand the history of thought involved.  For example, Mayr first proposed punctuated equilibrium, as noted by S. J. Gould and Niles Eldredge, and defined much of the evolutionary landscape of speciation. Without the knowledge of Mayr's contribution and contributions made by other biological giants, starting with Darwin and going on through Sewell Wright, George Gaylord Simpson, the Huxleys, Dobzhansky, George Williams and many others, the rich development of biological thought is almost indecipherable.  In essence, we really need to know how a particular idea was derived in order to understand its significance (It was not until I was taught the significance of the history behind cell theory that I really appreciated it!) This is how biology should be taught and this is a good book with which to start.  I recommend it highly.iated it!) This is how biology should be taught and this is a good book with which to start.

Shirley Sherwood has brought together her remarkable collection of modern botanical paintings (and some ink renderings) in \\"A Passion for Plants: Contemporary Botanical Masterworks\\" and made them accessible to the public.  It is certainly an impressive effort.<br /><br />Unlike many styles of illustration, botanical art usually involved a finely detailed painting on a white background, occasionally with additional smaller drawings or paintings.  Occasionally a background is also provided, but most have no background.  The renditions of just about every artist featured are extremely well done and it is hard to pick a favorite.  Kate Nessler's watercolor of Rose Hips & Oak Leaves, Mariko Imai's exquisite watercolors of carnivorous plants, Elizabeth Dowle's paintings of fruit, Francesca Anderson's detailed ink renditions of sunflowers and cacti, and John Wilkinson's ultra realistic (complete with insect damage and hover flies!) watercolor of Ligularia, are just a few of the treats in this magnificent book.  It sure makes for a tough standard, but a worthy one, for us beginners!<br /><br />A great book for artists, botanists and anyone interested in plant illustration!	2005-05-07

Only in the last few years have I had much time to devote to such endeavors and even then it has been rather catch as catch can.  My main interest in art is in the capture of natural images (I took scientific illustration in college), but I appreciate the fact that art and stark realism may express somewhat different truths about the subject.  As a rank amateur in watercolor art I also appreciate deeply such roadmap-like guide books as Ferdinand Petrie's \\"The Big Book of Painting Nature in Watercolor.\\"  At first the title turned me off, but in perusing a copy (and later acquiring it) I found it to be an excellent guide to capturing the essence of a natural scene in one of the most difficult of all media- watercolor (only pen and ink may be more demanding from my experience!)<br /><br />The coupling of Petrie's step by step paintings and the exquisite photographs of John Shaw has produced a book that is both visually beautiful and informative.  Using the techniques described and with one's own reference photos in hand (or under an open sky direct from nature) a novice painter can slowly gain the knowledge and skill necessary to succeed in producing credible paintings.<br /><br />A while back a scientist colleague of mine asked me why make a painting or drawing when you can photograph any subject with clarity.  As a person who takes my own reference photos and enjoys doing so I can say he has a point, but reality does not necessarily come only from an exact replication of a scene.  In the process of painting from nature (or from a reference photograph) you often notice more complex details, even in apparently simple subjects, then you would ordinarily notice in a photograph by itself.  Petrie has emphasized the observation of these complex details and their interpretation in watercolor.  If nothing else the instructions that point the artist toward this close observation of complexity in nature are worth the price of the book.mplexity in nature are worth the price of the book.	2005-04-24

Despite the fact that we gain our food directly or indirectly from the soil, few people think much about what exists between the soil particles.  In fact the soil is so full of living things that it could almost be considered to be alive itself.  If an alien spacecraft landed on almost any soil surface on earth it would find recognizable life processes without much trouble, but then our planet may be a bit weird (at least as weird as Mars or Saturn's moon Titan!).<br /><br />David W. Wolfe has presented a very readable and fascinating view of the soil and its biota in his book \\"Tales from the Underground.\\"  From soil microorganisms (some not so \\"friendly\\") through earthworms to prairie dogs, the reader it treated to a broad panorama of life.  It is now suspected that the number of species in the soil (and even into the rocky crust) may be larger than for that on the surface.  E. O. Wilson has said that if he were to have another career it would be in the ecology of the microorganisms in tropical soils, and I think he is on to something.<br /><br />Sadly, there are relatively few soil biologists.  Specialists in, for example, earthworms (creatures that as Darwin noted are largely responsible for the development of humus in the temperate parts of the world), are few and far between as noted by Ehrenfeld in his book \\"Beginning Again.\\"  Yet our crops, and thus our very life on this planet, depend on such soil-forming organisms.<br /><br />I once visited a citrus grove in Florida where nearly every chlorinated hydrocarbon known to man had been used against the ever present insect pests.  It was a spooky place.  The soil itself could be used as a pesticide and there were, as far as I could ascertain, no ants or spiders.  While I was there I heard no birds singing.  All of these observations were certainly odd as in every other grove I had ever visited both ants and spiders were common and bird song could be heard periodically.  The only living creatures I found were earwigs!  Thousands of them existed under the leaf litter.  Apparently resistant to the DDT, chlordane, toxophene, aldrin and dialdrin that had been used on the grove, they had proliferated beyond belief.  Human activities such as this, as noted by Wolfe, need to be mitigated if we are to have a sustainable society.  We cannot think of nature as something to conquer.  His last chapter  \\"The Good Earth\\" should be read by anyone who has a stake in solving the problems that may lead to our demise as a species- and that means all of us!  Still Wolfe points out that we have to be \\"conditional optimists\\" to progress.  Pessimistic despair will get us nowhere and \\"pathological optimism\\" has gotten us to this point. Perhaps it is a time for moderation in our thinking, while knowing that we may have to make some drastic changes in our attitudes to get anywhere!  It is certainly unfortunate that several current governments are still in the \\"pathological optimism\\" mode, but then facing unpleasant facts is always hard!  However, many national and international corporations, the World Bank and a number of insurance agencies are taking the threat seriously.  After all they will certainly be affected by such drastic changes that may be in the offing.

Her five kingdoms can be interpreted as six kingdoms (commonly the Archaea are separated from the other bacteria to form the sixth kingdom), or as over 30 kingdoms (if Carl Woese's system is used.)  For practical purposes the six kingdom's concept seems reasonable to me, although specialists may prefer a more complex grouping and several \\"domains\\" of life.<br /><br />That said, \\"Five Kingdoms\\" is a delight to read and a great introduction to the huge diversity of earth's complex biota. Each group is discussed in detail and a sampling of genera listed.  Good black and white photographs and drawings illustrate each group discussed.<br /><br />If you prefer the six kingdoms concept you can just split out the Archaea, but the other kingdoms are unchanged.  If you like the multiple kingdoms concept, this is best discussed in Tudge's 2000 book \\"The Variety of Life.\\"  As can be readily seen, higher classification of living things is difficult primarily because of the complexity of mostly microscopic organisms and thus the general public will probably find the discussions tough going.  The amateur and professional biologist, as well as the well-read layman, will be fascinated because the organisms, from radiolarians to elephants and diatoms to redwoods are so interesting in themselves.<br /><br />In general I recommend this book to those who are interested in any phase of the biodiversity on our planet.	2005-03-19

This exploration forces the reader to rethink what \\"reality\\" is.  In the process we realize that we \\"know\\" very little about reality.  Despite the huge databases we are developing we actually have not answered the big questions about existence.  Nor are we likely to do so in the near future.<br /><br />Fundamentalists who try to fit earth history (and indeed the history of the whole universe) into 6,000 years are almost certainly wrong.  However, because of the nature of science we cannot congratulate ourselves just yet.  While our data tell us that the earth itself is several billion years old, we also have made some unsupported assumptions (certainly not as many as the fundamentalists, but more than a few).  Even mathematics and physics are not completely free of assumptions that cannot be tested, at least not yet.<br /><br />Researchers such as Murray Gell-Mann and Stuart Kauffman at the Santa Fe Institute are busily probing the frontiers of complexity and in the process may be starting to get glimpses of just how weird our universe really is.  Johnson, who is not a scientist, but a science writer, captures the excitement of this possibly ground-breaking research which may eventually show us a universe much different from that we had previously imagined. Questions arise about our immediate corner of that universe, the part with which we should be the most familiar.  Is the evolution of life contingent as Steven Jay Gould might imagine it, or is it inevitably to result in creatures such as ourselves, as Simon Conway Morris believes?  Are we just lumbering robots carrying our genes around (as Richard Dawkins has said), or something more significant?  Can adaptationist' \\"just so stories\\" explain life? Or are we creating all of our own \\"reality\\" because of a deep need for order?  My guess is that the answer is somewhere in between these extreme views, but the actual reality (if we ever glimpse it) is probably going to be very strange to us.<br /><br />Johnson has brought up these questions and exposed them to our view, along with the researcher's views and doubts. It is perhaps the latter that is most instructive because it demonstrates that, despite our often arrogant opinions on the matter, we still don't really know for sure.re in between these extreme views, but the actual reality (if we ever glimpse it) is probably going to be very strange to us.

The result is a charming series of vignettes on smoking mountains old and new from Vesuvius and Etna to Paricutin, Popocateptl, Pelee and Shasta.  I have lived in the vicinity of inactive volcanoes for much of my life and in 1999 I flew over Popocateptl while it was smoking, the clouds just lifting enough to show the nearly perfect and almost snow-free cone of Popo and the blade-like (and snow-covered) summit of Iztaccihuatl.  It was a very awe-inspiring sight!  Earlier aerial views of Mt. Shasta, Mt. Hood, Mt. St. Helens and the rest of the chain of Cascade volcanoes were also quite impressive, although none of them were erupting at the time.<br /><br />Calderazzo has captured the human connection with these impossible to stop forces of nature.  Lava flows and explosive eruptions do not stop for any of our puny wishes that they would.  A volcano is a truly irresistible force, destroying with ease, yet leaving fertile soil that is very tempting for cultivators.  A vast amount of stories and folklore has build up about them and this book takes us on a personal tour of some of the most interesting \\"live\\" and \\"dead\\" mountains of fire.  The author has an interesting style, holding the reader spell- bound with his descriptions of geological processes and the human response to them.<br /><br />I did find a few irritating typos, but generally the book reads well and I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed in it.  If you are at all interested in our earth and how humans relate to it, this is a very good book to read.	2005-02-26

We, with good reason, teach American history in schools (although sometimes not well enough when you see polls showing that a unusually high number of our citizens cannot tell the Constitution well enough to distinguish it from the Communist Manifesto!) and to a lesser extent European and sometimes Asian histories.  However when we were dealing with the two World Wars, others on the so-called fringes of the civilized world were doing the same.  We tend to often ignore parts of the world that do not immediately impinge on us, but we may do so at our peril (as was graphically shown on September 11, 2001!)<br /><br />It is one of the far-flung parts of the once huge French empire that is the subject of a very unusual book by the well-known primatologist Alison Jolly.  \\"Lords and Lemurs\\" is mostly set in southern Madagascar in an area dominated by mimosa thorn scrub and populated by the native Tandroy, the French settlers and by several species of Madagascar's unique lemurs.  Jolly writes a somewhat eccentric book about a very eccentric (from our view!) land.  You find it difficult to dislike most of the people, even though some had to fight for the puppet government of Vichy during World War II and you find the fauna and flora fascinating.<br /><br />Jolly does not spoon feed us.  We are shown the horrors as well as the joys.  Lemurs, we find, are not quite the cuddly creatures of Disney cartoons (they fight and sometimes kill even their own species), but they are for all that enchanting creatures (and who are we to throw stones anyway?) The people have not always had admirable intentions and are sometimes quite flawed. The French colonial government included some sadistic types who used their power to torture and rape and some natives staged somewhat brutal (if often also somewhat muted by today's standards) uprisings and sometimes threw their best friends in jail.  On the other hand you see people go to extremes to help others in times of need in ways that make you admire their moral strength.  You even understand the French fighting the British on Madagascar, despite the fact that the British forces are acting against Hitler and Tojo.  Local conditions alter realities and \\"friends\\" may become bitter enemies.  You are also to some extent shown the environmental successes as well as the stupidities. However, the book is mostly about very different peoples facing the often grim realities of life and often surviving.<br /><br />If you would like to broaden your understanding of our world, both human and \\"natural\\" (a false dichotomy in any case!) read this book!jail.

The story can be quite improbable, yet hold together quite well if well constructed.  Neal Asher's new book \\"The Skinner\\" is just such a well structured story.  As a biologist who likes a good tale of strange planets and creatures, I was quite pleased to find this riveting tale.  The book has something for every sci fi fan- a strange world with oceans full of weird predators (not totally unlike our own, but perhaps a bit more dangerous!), alien minds controlling or communicating with humans and machines, galactic conspiracies, viruses that cause infected organisms to be more resistant to injury, a cast of characters with their own secrets, and nearly indestructible sea captains who are the survivors from a human slave industry based on a war between quite different galactic civilizations.  The founder of that illegal activity, the space pirate Jay Hoop, has become (after 700 years) a very dangerous outlaw indeed- the Skinner (I won't describe this entity further as it might spoil the reader's fun!)  He and his surviving associates are the targets of a former warden (Keech) who was killed by one of them and was \\"revived\\" as a sort of half-living reification.  His mission is to finish off the last of the outlaws, who were all condemned to death.  He is aided in part by a woman (Erlin) who is searching for one of the old captains (Ambel), and a former indentured slave (Janer) to the hive mind of intelligent earth hornets who carries two of the hornets with him.  Add assorted Old Captains, various mercenaries, animated sails, giant leeches and numerous others, and you get a complex weave of very evocative interactions.<br /><br />This is not simply another in a series of spin-offs from major movies or TV scripts (a pet peeve of mine) but a full blown hard-core sci fi masterpiece in the tradition of Van Vogt (although perhaps with a bit more logic than some of his tales).  It holds together well and the pieces of plot spin toward each other in a structured fashion, making you nearly believe in the strange happenings on the eccentric world called Splatterjay.  I recommend it as a rousing good tale of a seemingly almost possible world.of his tales).

South Africa, especially during the Apartheid period and after, was dangerous, dirty and fraught with difficulties almost unimaginable to people who have never lived in such conditions. This is not the classic white coat science of the laboratory (which has its own set of difficulties) but really down and dirty get-in-the-mud field research under the worst possible conditions. That Ward, his associate Roger Smith and others persevered in their quest is astonishing.  But they did and we now know considerably more about the Permian-Triassic boundary extinction because of it.  It must be added that their families bore a tremendous burden for them to do so and should be applauded as much as the scientists involved.<br /><br />This is a real scientific detective story with all the drama you could ever want.  However Ward has not left out the mundane details- heat, flies, ticks, lack of medical help, poor pay and general support, stupid mistakes and everything else that makes up real life field work in the sciences.  This is the way it is, which is not quite as glamorous as is usually reported in the newspapers!<br /><br />The problem Ward was working on is a fascinating one; how long was the Permian-Triassic extinction event and what caused it?  The Cretaceous - Tertiary (K-T) extinction event has been apparently solved by the Alverez team with the discovery that a giant asteroid struck the planet at that point in time, but other extinction events have been more problematic.  The extinction events that punctuated the history of life on earth were extremely important in defining our current world and the mammal-like reptiles of the Permian became our ancestors.  Had they been wiped out, as over 90 per cent of life was, we would quite possibly not exist. In addition, such events could conceivably happen again and so our existence and that of other life forms on this planet could be threatened.  The subject is thus not without major interest for the human species.<br /><br />Read this book if you want to find out how real research is done in the field.  It eliminates some of the more common myths about field science and make you appreciate how hard it is to wrest information from the natural world, a truth that is so in the laboratory as much as in the field.rth were extremely important in defining our current world and the mammal-like reptiles of the Permian became our ancestors.

Occasionally a book comes along that provides a glimmer of hope in the chaos. \\"Bones of the Master\\" is just such a book.  An admittedly imperfect man (George Crane), who is not exactly sure who he is or what he wants and has failed in two marriages and is now on his third, meets an old Ch'an monk (Tsung Tsai), who has moved to a nearby self-built house in Woodstock, New York.  He is then drawn into the monk's project to find the bones of Shiuh Deng, Tsung Tsai's old teacher, who is buried in an unknown location in the middle of China's forbidden Inner Mongolia.  His understanding third wife lets him go on this apparently mad venture (although their daughter is not quite so forgiving).  The resulting book describes the complex and difficult trip that eventually takes them (without official permission) into the heart of the Yin Shan Mountains and very nearly kills them both.<br /><br />In his philosophic conversations with Crane, Tsung Tsai both decries superstition in his positive attitude toward science and negative one toward foolish beliefs, and seems to placate it in his talk of hungry ghosts and of the fox god. However the reader is left with the uncanny feeling that the old Ch'an monk is just playing with the concepts of emptiness and the Tao (early Taoist ideas are deeply ingrained in Ch'an). In many ways I think that Tsung Tsai recognizes that metaphor can be a powerful truth without being literally true.  In the process of making this trip he also exudes compassion for all beings- a goat about to be slaughtered, a child with a burned face and a man dying of cancer, among others.  I only wish that all \\"religious\\" people on this planet could also have this view as it would eliminate much of the world's problems.<br /><br />As a scientist I believe in a basic Aristotelian methodology.  Evidence is important to establish literal truth and thus not all ideas are equal.  Still, there are great mysteries about our world, our life and the other living things with which we share it, which science has yet to resolve (if it is indeed possible to do so).  In addition, there are metaphoric \\"truths\\" that only fit within the human social context and need not be taken literally to have value within that frame of reference.  In this I am not talking about obvious delusions or frauds (such as astrology, UFOs, magic, witchcraft, faith healing, s&eacute;ances or Satanism and many others), but of a broad conceptual realm that gives people some foundation for living in an often difficult world.<br /><br />Whether you think there is something to Ch'an or Tibetan Buddhism or not, this is a very good book to read.  Despite Crane's interjections of his own biases and faults (or perhaps in part because of them), this tale leads one to compassion for all of the participants.

This is a book to use in the field as it is really \\"pocket-sized.\\"  However it still has excellent photographs and enough detail to be useful.<br /><br />The Southwest has a surprisingly large fauna of odonates and as the hobby of dragonfly watching is catching on it is an increasingly popular area for such activities.  While this guide does not cover all odonates in the Southwest, it does give the owner resources to identify the rest through a complete list, references and internet links.  This is a nice feature as some of the species not covered can be unusually common in special locations.  The Seaside Dragonlet, for example, is quite abundant at Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge near Roswell, New Mexico.<br /><br />It is great to see my favorite insects (possibly only excepting tiger beetles) become popular as subjects of study.  From an aesthetic standpoint dragonflies are much better studied alive and photographed than collected because (even using modern techniques) the often brilliant colors tend to fade in death.  While actual specimens are often necessary for documentation and taxonomic study, appreciation for the living insect can have value in behavioral studies and really good photographs of living examples can back up documentation of distributions.  Appreciation of scarce wetlands in the Southwest and elsewhere is another benefit.<br /><br />A necessity for anyone interested in the dragonfly and damselfly fauna of the Southwest, this book will inspire you to get out into the field and really see these amazing creatures.	2005-01-15

Parasitology is a subject that makes the average person blanch.  When I was at the University of Florida many years ago I would sometimes get into a discussion of the more gruesome aspects with another person who was interested in the biology of parasites. In the process we could easily totally gross out any others listening.  Still, as Carl Zimmer points out in \\"Parasite Rex\\" parasites are the norm, not the exception and that should be a major reason to read about them.<br /><br />Zimmer is an excellent writer on popular biological science and this book shows his talent well.  In nearly 250 pages of text he describes the fascinating and often disturbing world of parasites, from blood flukes in humans to crustaceans that eat fish tongues and then act as a replacement. Wherever you look there are parasitic worms, arthropods, and even birds.  Blood-sucking, organ-destroying and skin-eating creatures exist in amazing variety and in some areas cause untold misery.  The average person maintains a host of relatively benign creatures, some of which can become problems under the right circumstances.  In addition, a person can easily pick up some much nastier critters (such as malarial parasites) while traveling, or even in one's own back yard, where parasitic worms and protozoans may be lurking.  Hookworm used to be a major problem in some parts of the American South and filariasis was even briefly a problem in Charleston, South Carolina (a nasty result of the slave trade).  These days modern airplanes can transport parasites in or on their hosts quite far from their place of origin and in a very short time.<br /><br />That we have a morbid fascination for such creatures is well shown by various science fiction movies and TV shows where the \\"Alien\\" and fungal pathogens become objects of terror.  We should also be fascinated by the often bizarre lives and shapes of real parasites and parasitoids (those that normally kill their hosts) on the planet that we share with them<br /><br />Not for the squeamish, this book should still be read by anyone who wants to be knowledgeable about the subject.  You never know, it could help the reader avoid a nasty problem, while serving as a really good read at the same time!/><br />Not for the squeamish, this book should still be read by anyone who wants to be knowledgeable about the subject.

I was inspired to read this book by having heard the author speak about the same subject (very eloquently) at our local university.  In reading the current work I was impressed by her grasp of history (something I wish were true of those she writes about) and the circuitous route of that history to the modern world as we know it. As she suggests, the fundamentalists of Islam, Judaism and Christianity are indeed part of the modern world and in fact could not exist in any other.<br /><br />There are many stripes of fundamentalism, not just Islamic, Jewish or Christian, but (as Ms. Armstrong notes) Hindu, Buddhist, and other religions.  Even scientists, atheists, and other rationalists can have a fundamentalist mindset.  Communism, Nazism and other non-theological ideologies have actually caused more death in the 20th Century than religious disputes, but then these were, in more ways than one, secular religions.  As Armstrong points out, militant religious fundamentalism exists at least in part as a reaction to the threat posed by militant modernity (and vice versa).  The humbling of William Jennings Bryant at Dayton, Tennessee, during the Scopes trial is a case in point.  Although Scopes was convicted of illegally teaching evolution against state law, the unthinking Christian fundamentalism of Bryant (who was in many other ways a liberal reformer) was exposed to ridicule by Darrow and Mencken.  This insult was not lost on the fundamentalists, who developed more radical views in their bitterness and this eventually led to the strident assaults on evolution in the schools by creationists and proponents of \\"Intelligent Design\\".  Similarly Osama bin Laden in a video (not covered in this book as it happened too recently) stated that his attack on the United States was in part hatched when he watched US ships fire on targets in Lebanon during the Israeli invasion. Christian, Moslem, and Jewish fundamentalism are the result of a fearful reaction to the threat which, the fundamentalists believe, the modern secular world poses to their way of life.<br /><br />Certainly neither I nor Ms. Armstrong  can exactly compare the creationist onslaught on public schools to the actual slaughter of innocent people by Islamic militants, but they are both a result of a deep resentment  of the modern world's disdain of their most cherished beliefs.  To be able to combat such acts they must be understood in that context.<br /><br />To show how far from their supposed principles fundamentalists can go in pursuit of their goals Armstrong notes that several of the hijackers of the airliners that slammed into the World Trade Center acted in a most un-Islamic way prior to their mission, including drinking and entering nightclubs.  Yet they thought that by sacrificing their lives in destroying the towers, they would enter the Islamic heaven.  Many extreme fundamentalists believe that what you do on earth is no consequence if you are faithful in the performance of certain acts of violence in opposition to secularism.  Extreme Christian fundamentalists also believe that they may need to help bring on the End Times, leading to the rule of Christ in a new age of righteousness.  Some bitter fanatics would even resort to violence, much like the Islamic militants, as in the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City in response to the government destruction of the Branch Davidians. Extreme fundamentalists have indeed gone very far from their core teachings.  In Christianity they tend to ignore Jesus' actual words (except for a few that fit their rather skewed view of reality) and yet claim to be true to every jot and title of the Bible.  Millenarianists who \\"need\\" to bring on the End Times, or to protect themselves from a perceived (and sometimes real) threat by modernity, and believers who are convinced that they will be richly rewarded for an act of violence,are very dangerous to the society in which they live.  How do we give people the maximum of religious liberty and at the same time discourage such dangerous tendencies toward nihilism?<br /><br />This book is (as far as I know) the most complete current exposition on this very human difficulty.  The abiding question of whether we can lessen the intolerance of both fundamentalism for the modern world and the modern world's intolerance for religious belief is very important for the future of our civilization. As an agnostic and a scientist who has contact with a number of religious groups it is my fervent hope that moderate and liberal religion can have more impact on religious thought, and that modernity, as represented by the secular state and science, can be more tolerant (and even respectful) of religion. By moderate and liberal religions I mean those that exhibit one of the best characteristics of all major religions- compassion! After all it is not exactly true that any of us, in our very core, is certain of our facts.  None of us was there when the foundations of the universe was laid down! Thus we should be able to respect the right of every human to come to their own way of finding meaning in life, as long as they do not advocate physical harm to others who do not believe as they do.  Like it or not we live in a pluralistic society and to maintain the benefits of that society, while tackling the difficult problems that beset us, we need to not be at each other's throats.<br /> Read this book if you would have some understanding of the historical background of the fundamentalist mindset.

My older daughter gave me a copy for Christmas and I have been reading it with rapt attention (a good Buddhist word!)  John Daido Loori, who was at one time a physical chemist and is now a Zen priest, shares with us his innermost thoughts on what creativity means to a practitioner of Zen, as well as to himself as a photographer and artist.  Indeed, it means a lot!  The attention given to seemingly simple tasks is the stuff of the best science, the best art and the best of religion.  This book is well worth reading for anyone who would like to understand the creative act, even if they do not follow the practice of Zen. Indeed, \\"The Zen of Creativity\\" is a well prepared, but sensible, literary meal to be savored with each page.<br /><br />The chapters are punctuated with quotations from the writings of Suzuki, Thoreau, Koestler, Emerson, Rilke, Dogen, Da Vinci, Gaugain, T. S. Eliot, Whitman and Einstein. Each has been well selected and fits with Loori's prose.  The book is written with both seriousness and good humor.  While I cannot agree with everything Loori writes (I find his one astrological encounter a bit odd, but than he never explains it as anything other than a strange prediction that somehow came true- I suspect that this had more to do with the astrologers shrewd judgment of personality than the alignment of the stars) I find myself agreeing with over 90 percent of it. He has a way of touching the essential points that I find refreshing in this troubled time.  If only religion was always approached in such a reasonable way, we might not be in our current predicament!<br /><br />If you are interested in art, photography, poetry, or Buddhism, or just in getting a fresh perspective on these subjects, this is a book you really should read.	2004-12-26

In her newest Marcus Didius Falco mystery \\"Scandal Takes a Holiday\\" Lindsey Davis has made another hit.  I usually don't read mysteries, but I make her books an exception because I like her ability to provide atmosphere.  She is one of the best writers of historical mysteries and a good part of that is that after reading one of her books you actually feel as if you have been to Rome, Roman Britain, and North Africa or, in the case of the present work, the Roman port city of Ostia.<br /><br />In the current book, Falco and his patrician wife, Helena Justina, are involved in searching for a scandal-mongering scribe from the Imperial sanctioned Gazette who has disappeared, apparently in Ostia while visiting his aunt.  The following enticing tale involves the protagonists in contact with pirates, various relatives, including Falco's shady father and scapegrace Uncle, and numerous shady characters in an ancient port city so vividly described that you can smell the salt air and hear the gulls cry.  The ending, as always, results from twists and turns that leave the reader breathless.<br /><br />This is a great book to read when you want to relax from the trials of modern life. In the process the reader is reminded that such trials are only somewhat different (and in most cases a bit easier to deal with for us privileged Westerners) than those of the past. In essence difficulties in life always have and always will remain a part of the human condition.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Scandal Takes a Holiday\\" without reservation.	2004-11-28

I seldom read fiction but I make exceptions for some science fiction and very rarely mysteries (my wife is an avid mystery reader and so I get my pick).  In these genres I only read works by authors whom I consider to be good writers and that fit my interests in history and science. I realize that this may sound a bit high-handed and arrogant, but I only have a limited amount of time for recreational reading and so have to pick and choose.  Lindsey Davis is one of those authors that always fits my standards. Anything written by her is sure to be a good read and is always thought provoking.<br /><br />In her recent book (2003) \\"The Accusers\\" she has not disappointed me.  Her knowledge of the culture of ancient Rome of Vespasian's time is astounding, at least as far as I can tell.  The informer Marcus Didius Falco, his indomitable patrician wife Helena Justina, their various relatives, associates and enemies round out a group worthy of a Russian novel.<br /><br />In \\"The Accusers\\" a Roman citizen, beset with legal problems, apparently commits suicide at the urging of his wife and possible collusion of his daughter (suicide would cut back on the liability of the family and save the family fortune, which in another twist has been left not to the man's wife, but to his daughter-in-law!) As it becomes evident that the death was murder, his son Negrinus becomes an easy target of those would profit by the murder.  Falco and Associates (Falco's wife and her two brothers are the staff) take on the defense of Negrinus (also known as \\"Birdy\\"), who they realize is hiding something.

This book has always been a big hit with the numerous public school classes that visit our museum.  I only have to hold it up to get a reaction, usually a groan, but it sure gets their attention.  It also starts discussions and questions even when other parts of the presentation have not.  The photos are great and add immensely to the charm of the book.<br /><br />In general Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio have written a book in \\"Man Eating Bugs: The Art and Science of Eating Insects\\" that is largely color photos.  But what photos!  Each present parts of a story involving the way various cultures employ insects in their cuisine.  This brings up a question used by a much earlier author as a book title - \\"Why Not Eat Insects?\\"  Many (but by no means all!) species of both insects and arachnids are as edible as the shrimp and crabs we Americans love to consume.  We of course have to be cautious (not a good idea to eat cockroaches, despite some \\"reality\\" TV programs!), but there are a number of \\"safe\\" species that have been \\"taste tested\\" so to speak.  In addition, we unwittingly consume tons of insects in various agricultural products simply because they pose no health hazard and are nearly impossible to remove.<br /><br />If you have to deal with children in education or if you are just curious about what other cultures eat, this is a great book both to read and just to peruse.  I would think that it would find its way to school libraries and to home schoolers lists of resources!	2004-11-22

The cast is huge and runs the gamut from ergot of rye through food plant pathogens, human and animal pathogens, molds, yeasts, mushrooms and rot fungi.  All have complicated life cycles and are often only noticed when the put up fruiting bodies (as in mushrooms). While mushrooms have a certain following, most other fungi are not especially well liked.  This is a bit of a pity, as many are quite interesting and some serve important functions from even our point of view.<br /><br />George W. Hudler, a professor of plant pathology at Cornell University, has produced in \\"Magical Mushrooms. Mischievous Molds\\" a solid and well illustrated review of these important, but often ignored, life forms that should intrigue even those who find fungi boring. This well-written book certainly is an easy read and provides numerous fascinating facts about the fungus world.  From the effects of ergot and hallucinogenic mushrooms to the tree death-dealing Dutch elm disease and fermenting yeasts, Hudler covers the field with a thoroughness not usually seen in a book of this size.<br /><br />There have been several very good books on fungi in recent years, most involving mushrooms, but Hudler, has I think, written the best of all. A fascinating read and I recommend it highly!	2004-11-19
US	52626966	R1FRWNNQ255PJ1	0691057575	602998129	Why Men Won't Ask for Directions: The Seductions of Sociobiology	Books	5	5	8	N	Y	The Problem with Teleological Thinking	When I was a graduate student I cut my teeth on books by George C. Williams and Ernst Mayr, as well as having several important aspects of scientific methodology drummed into my head.  I learned that the individual phenotype was the target of selection, because it was the visible manifestation of the organism in the real world.  I was also taught, emphatically, that you had to follow the evidence, not let your hypotheses run wild.  You just did not extrapolate beyond your data!  J. Henri Fabre (the 19th Century French entomologist) took that last idea to an extreme and denied the utility of even solid theory, thus refusing to accept Darwin's ideas on the basis that they were too speculative.  In that Fabre was wrong (as he was in his insistence that insects were totally automatons.)  Still one can easily go too far in the other direction and (unfortunately) some biologists, especially sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists, have done so.<br /><br />Richard C. Francis in his new book \\"Why Men Won't Ask for Directions\\" has made several pointed criticisms of teleological answers to why question (as opposed to how questions) in biology. In some ways I think that he has been a little too hard on the sociobiologists, who have certainly added to our knowledge- particularly in regard to how social insect societies work- and have brought up some important aspects of human behavior, but the points he makes are well taken.  A few more strident evolutionary psychologists have indeed gone off on a teleological binge! Some of their \\"just so\\" stories are no more convincing to me than the creation story involving a god or gods making species. Evolution is not purposeful. It is in essence a tinkerer (more like a farmer using bailing wire to fix a tractor), not a designer (an engineer drawing up plans for a new bridge), and evolutionary events are not planned by gods or nature substituting for gods, but are driven by contingency.<br /><br />Also, organisms are more plastic in their behavior than we generally give them credit for and we have to be very careful in using anthropomorphic (unfortunately rampant in some sociobiological writings) or teleological language to describe their behaviors, and the origins of behaviors, or we tend to bias our interpretation. One of Fabre's flaws in his studies of hunting wasps was that he insisted on the absolute rigidity of the behavior of his subjects (Sphecidae, Scoliidae and Pompilidae), while ignoring any evidence to the contrary.  This was eloquently pointed out by George and Elizabeth Peckham in their later studies of wasp behavior.  Like Fabre, sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists tend to be absolute in their view of all organisms being totally the result of an adaptation (driven by genes) to a given environment.  I think in order to make a case for such an interpretation you must, like Fabre, throw out any data that does not agree with your hypothesis.<br /><br />Teleology is fine, as long as you don't get caught up in the idea (too easy to do) that it actually explains things.  Mayr says that it is a powerful heuristic methodology, and he is probably correct because humans like to have just so stories because they understand them.  But are these stories a true reflection of reality?  Maybe so (as Mark Twain might say), but any hypothesis that results in extraordinary claims must be backed up with extraordinary evidence.  And unfounded ideas about human nature may actually be dangerous, as they may influence policy makers in the areas of economics, education, social structure, and even warfare.  I would feel much better if the sociobiologists explored alternative explainations more and gave the adaptationist model a rigorous testing. Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin may be wrong in postulating the Spandrels of San Marco (non-adaptive traits as a side effect of selection), but I have yet to see a better idea come up.  Instead we have an explosion of often far-fetched \\"evolutionary\\" explainations for the adaptiveness of this or that, such as homosexuality being an adaptive trait to produce helpers to raise close kin!  Will we \\"find\\" a gene or part of the brain that exists solely to write Beethoven's 9th Symphony next? Such weak foundations lay evolution open to attacks by creationists and others who will use the faults in teleological thinking to push their own very teleological program.<br /><br />To me both genetic determinism-adaptationism (sociobiology and evolutionary psychology) at its worst and behavioral determinism (blank slateism) at its worst are poor substitutes for sound theory based on evidence that is (as Karl Popper put it) FALSIFIABLE (i.e. testable in such a way that it can be proven false.)  Teleological thinking, as pointed out by Francis, just cannot meet this test.<br /><br />This book is a generally well-stated critique of the current regrettable trends in sociobiology and evolutionary psychology and should be read by every evolutionary biologist and anyone else who is interested in evolution.evolutionary\\" explainations for the adaptiveness of this or that, such as homosexuality being an adaptive trait to produce helpers to raise close kin!

The actions of such body parts were also taboo.  In fact nobody ever went to the bathroom or shared a bed on early television, even if married!  As a child I wondered if such grand people as the President of the United States actually used the bathroom at all except to bathe!  The toilet was a little mentioned, though necessary fixture.<br /><br />Times have changed (some would say for the worst!) and I, for one, find it refreshing to have the WHOLE BODY examined in \\"Adam's Navel: A Natural and Cultural History of the Human Form,\\" by Michael Sims.  While numerous books have appeared on this and related subjects in recent years, Sims has contributed by given us a solid popular overview.  His accounts of the biology and lore of the hair, head, face, eyes, nose, lips, ears, arms, hands, breasts, navels, genitalia, and legs make fascinating reading.<br /><br />Certainly, despite the more open climate, prudery has not left us. We still live in times when an Attorney General is afraid to appear in the same photograph as a statue of Justice with a naked breast! This incident led to numerous jokes and did little to improve the image of the office!<br /><br />If you are interested in the external human body (probably most everybody as we are \\"owners\\" and \\"operators\\" of the same) you will find numerous anecdotes, facts and fables relating to our intimate selves.	2004-11-05

Still earth history is important to us all as it deals with the formation of minerals, rocks and energy sources like coal and oil, as well as the origin and evolution of life, the causes of volcanoes and earth quakes, the movements of continents and the development and possible future of the atmosphere.  Indeed it encompasses the very foundation of our existence.  In \\"The Earth Machine: The Science of a Dynamic Planet\\" Edmond A. Mathez and James D. Webster have given this subject a new breath of life and have produced probably the best introduction to geology for the layman currently in print.<br /><br />In their book they explain current theories on the evolution and movement of continents, the development of life, the formation of the atmosphere and the threats of ozone depletion and global warming, and many more aspects of the study of our home planet.  They give accounts of great volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, explain mountain building and ocean currents, discuss the weird ecosystems of hydrothermal vents and the formation of valuable productions of the earth like salt, gold and coal.  All the while they sprinkle in historical accounts of past geologists and their work in a fascinating narrative.<br /><br />All in all this is a great introductory text in earth history and I recommend it enthusiastically for anyone curious of how our blue planet functions.	2004-10-30

It has been used in advertising throughout the world because of its ease of recognition.  While everybody knows the identity of the statue almost immediately, few know the story of its discovery, transport from Melos in Greece to the Louvre, and the controversy that followed.  Gregory Curtis has given \\"flesh\\" to the marble by his often masterful descriptions of the actions of a few all too human men who were associated in some way with the statue after its discovery.  From Voutier, who actually recognized the stature as something of value after it had been discovered by a local farmer, through d'Urville who successfully took credit for the discovery, to Reinach and Furtw&auml;ngler who argued over the history of the Venus, the story is one of intrigue and curiously eccentric people.<br /><br />We now know the Venus was a Hellenistic rather than a classical Greek sculpture.  French pride kept that truth from emerging for many years, but also it was burdened with the idea that Hellenistic art was inferior. Indeed, so set was this idea that anything of such notable merit as the Venus must have come from the studio of a great of the classic age of Greece. The inscription found with it on an associated piece that fit the base had to thus be unassociated!  Wishful thinking is a hallmark of humanity!<br /><br />This is a well-written piece and should find readership with those who like to not only appreciate art, but to understand its history as well.	2004-10-18

I picked up new copies of the various pulp sci-fi magazines and a correspondent sent me his old copies.  I especially liked GALAXY, FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION and later ISAAC ASIMOV'S SCIENCE FICTION, but I occasionally read ANALOG as well.  I also read the novels by numerous sci-fi authors, including Asimov, Heinlein, Herbert, Norton and a host of others.  I don't read much of that genre these days because of time and the fact that while there was always a lot of schlock out there (as there is in any book type) it seems like many sci-fi books these days are take offs on movies or TV shows (I have a possibly snobbish dislike for such made up books).<br /><br />However, after reading Julie E. Czerneda's \\"Survival: Species Imperative #1\\" I may be hooked again.  Here is a sci.-fi. book actually written by someone trained in biology.  Yes, I know that the space travel involved probably does not have much of a scientific base (Isaac Asimov once said that one needed such devices just to make plots work), but the depth of the work keeps the reader turning pages.  While I have my doubts that we will ever (or at least in my lifetime) find aliens like the Dhryn or the Ro, they are fabulous constructs by someone who at least has a handle on how weird living things (even on this planet) can be.<br /><br />The book centers on one human- Mackenzie Winifred Elizabeth Wright Conner (Mac to her friends) and one alien- the Dhryn Brymn.  Mac is a biologist who studies salmon on the Pacific Coast; Brymn is an alien archeologist from a species that mostly has little use for science.  Add a \\"spy\\" named Nikolai Piotr Trojanowski, a Quechua biologist named Emily Mamani Sarmiento, worlds along a inter-stellar transport line being stripped of every living thing, and of course the seemingly ever present and possibly malevolent Ro, who are invisible and thus not easily understood, and you have a fascinating experiment in imagination- the \\"what if\\" that hooked me on science fiction in the beginning.<br /><br />The ending, which is far from obvious until almost the last 20 pages or so (although it starts to become somewhat plausible a bit earlier), leads us into both the light and the dark recesses of the mind- both of human and alien.<br /><br />This is a very good read for those who like a bit of meat in their sci.-fi.

A while back I wrote a review of the Peterson Series \\"Field Guide to Western Butterflies\\", which I had used in the field during the 4th of July Butterfly Count in the Organ Mountains of New Mexico. I gave it five stars as I thought it the best field guide to actually use in the field.  The rival Audubon guide to butterflies left me cold because it simply does not show enough detail for identifying hard species.  I thus dismissed photo guides because of this bad experience, thinking that artists did better work in illustrating these beautiful insects.  I was wrong!  There is a way to produce a photo guide to butterflies that actually works and Jeffrey Glassberg has done it!  This is the best field guide that I have ever seen for butterflies.  The photos, mostly taken by the author, are simply superb!  The best thing that Glassberg has done is to standardize the photos so you can compare the same characters.  This is a major innovation and must certainly have taken a lot of time.  The placing of maps and descriptions opposite the photographic plates is also a major change from the other popular guides.  It sure saves a lot of page flipping!<br /><br />I am often laughed at because I still use a 35 mm SLR for photographing insects, but Glassberg's photos (all with a 35 mm SLR) show why it still may pay.  Digitals are, I know, the coming thing and will soon overtake SLRs, but most digitals still cannot match an old Nikon FM2n with a 55 mm macro or an Olympus with a 90 mm macro, both of which I use.<br /><br />Glassberg's remarks about how much space digital shots take up (5 MB roughly for a decent high resolution) are probably dated because of gigabyte technology which allows as much as 200 shots at a time, even at high resolution.  However, I still like the feel of a SLR and many digitals (but not the more expensive ones) are boxy and difficult to hold. I get irritated with the automatic focus that often keeps me from getting the shot of an easily disturbed subject.<br /><br />Those aside; if you are at all interested in butterflies and can afford only one book, get this guide! It is the new standard for photo guides and it will be hard to ever beat it.you are at all interested in butterflies and can afford only one book, get this guide!

Several books have been recently published on these strange organisms and each has a slightly different slant on them.  Actually the very term \\"fungus\\" has undergone an evolutionary change over the last few decades.  Once part of the plant kingdom, fungi, minus several groups like slime molds and chytrids (although all are still covered in classes on mycology), now enjoy the status of their own kingdom.  And a very weird kingdom it is indeed! Nicholas Money from the Department of Botany at Miami University in Ohio has, in his book \\"Mr. Bloomfield's Orchard,\\" produced a fascinating set of essays on these organisms and the people who study them, from Ingoldian spores to John Webster and the phallic fungi.<br /><br />As a former resident of Gainesville, Florida, I was quite interested in his chapter on \\"Angels of Death.\\"  In it Money writes that he found Amanita virosa growing near Cedar Key in an area I used to frequent during my days as a graduate student.  The destroying angel is a very dangerous mushroom that should be avoided at all costs as it usually kills anyone so unfortunate to eat it. Money's description of these and other fungi that produce nasty toxins certainly gives one pause.<br /><br />Other topics include the rather bizarre sex life of fungi, and the numerous fungal parasites and symbionts associated with humans.  Finally the author gives us an equally fascinating description of Mr. Bloomfield's orchard, an untended apple orchard consumed by fungi.<br /><br />If you think that fungi don't matter, Money will change your mind, but if you are a bit put off by the subject don't read this book or your curiosity just might hook you into the Alice in Wonderland world of these \\"simple\\" organisms! In any case I recommend this book with only minor stylistic reservations.  I slightly prefer Hudler's \\"Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds\\" for style, but this is just personal taste and has little bearing on content.ttle bearing on content.	2004-09-20

John Cornwell has presented here two very important moral problems for a practicing scientist in just about any discipline, namely who owns the results of the scientific enterprise and to what uses should scientific discoveries be employed?  Scientists still to a large degree work at the direction and with the financial support of the state or industry, or both. We hope that at least most of these activities are in the interests of society, but sometimes they are not, and in many cases we do not always know for sure. In Nazi Germany most scientists did not ask questions about the uses of scientific work at all, or they supported the activities of the government. The few that did raise questions were usually those oppressed by the regime (mostly Jews and dissidents).  Even so there were clear examples of resistance.  Albert Einstein had long recognized the dangers in militarism and had renounced German citizenship before Hitler rose to power. Heinrich Wieland stayed in Germany, helped Jewish scientists, and refused to use the Hitler salute. Max Born and Max von Laue generally worked against the Nazis.  However these were more than matched by the complacent collaborators like Heisenberg, von Braun, Lorenz, von Weiz&auml;cker and others, as well as by the enthusiastic supporter of Nazism, including some Nobel Laureates like Lenard.<br /><br />Some scientists then fell back on the \\"scientific discovery is neutral and we are not to blame for uses to which others put it.\\" Some modern scientists still believe this today. However,  the neutrality of science concept is unfortunately not easily defended in the light of such outrages as the prison camp experimentation of a Mengele.  While I in principal favor free access to scientific knowledge, it is a responsibility of scientists, I think, to point out dangers and to oppose unethical methodology and uses of scientific research.  There are grave dangers in allowing  the system to run free with a technology that could destroy many innocent lives (weapons of mass destruction) or might even render the planet unlivable (as we seem to be slowly doing even without such weapons!)<br /><br />This book is a wake up call and I think Cornwell can be forgiven if he is a bit \\"preachy\\" on the subject.  Researchers need to understand the issues so that they are not lured into the same Faustian bargain made by most German scientists during the Hitler era. Scientists cannot remain aloof and pretend that nothing they do has any effect on the lives of people living on this planet.  To do so would show them up as naive elitists who care for nothing but their own prestige.  I thank whatever powers be that a few in Germany had the courage to speak up, but they were, alas, too few! Let us hope that future historians will not be able to say that about us!arch.

Leonard Mlodinow has opened Euclid's window and demonstrated why we should be in awe of Euclid's achievement and the achievements of the mathematicians and physicists who both preceded and followed him.  Thales, Pythagoras, Euclid himself, Descartes, Gauss, Einstein and Witten, along with Heisenberg, Schr&ouml;dinger, and others are made to live on these pages. Mlodinow adds many background points that help the reader understand the period in which the various geometric concepts were developed.<br /><br />Mathematics, including geometry, is by no means self evident.  Concepts that we take for granted were often hard won.  People were even murdered over the square root of 2 because irrational numbers were considered a secret! The struggle over the shape and size of the universe and earlier fights over the geometry of the solar system were difficult and often bitter.<br /><br />Geometry is one of the crowning achievements of our species and indeed laid the foundation for much art, philosophy and of course science.  Anyone who wants to really understand the latter should read this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this volume as among the best of the attempts to explain the basic concepts of mathematics upon which much of our civilization is based!	2004-08-22

Several books recently published by the Smithsonian Institution Press have been especially well produced. In an earlier review I noted the excellent &quot;Dragonflies of the World,&quot; which is much more than a coffee table book. Similarly &quot;Lichens&quot; by William Purvis has illuminated a little known part of the biological world - the obviously composite &quot;organisms.&quot; Lichens are a cooperative unit formed by fungus and an &quot;alga&quot; or a cyanobacterium. Some are easily separable into their component species, while others are almost single entities.<br /><br /> With exquisite photographs, interesting text and an attractive format, &quot;Lichens&quot; appears to be just about everything you ever wanted in a short introductory text. It is full of interesting facts about lichens.<br /><br /> I was disappointed in that Simon Schwendener, who was the first to discover that lichens were symbiotic entities, is discussed, but there is no mention of Beatrix Potter (well known for her children's books) for her role in supporting the symbiotic theory of lichens. Both were dismissed in their day, but later their ideas were accepted as it became obvious that they were right.<br /><br /> This is a great introduction to these weird entities, once thought to be likely candidates for native Martians. The price is very attractive as well!	2004-08-05

Along with Werner Nachtigall's &quot;Exploring with the Microscope&quot; this book is a great first book for the amateur microscopist. As a professional biologist who dabbles in amateur microscopy I have enjoyed both books. They do differ somewhat in their format. While Nachtigall's flows from some basic (and some more advanced) principles through examples of microorganisms, Eric Grave's book is divided into two parts, the first of which is a standard history of the microscope and fundamentals of techniques and the second of which tackles discoveries within the micro-world. The later has sections on such fascinating life forms as planaria, Paramecium, Didinium, Cyclops, symbiotic protozoa in insects and ruminants, Pilobolus (the sharp shooting fungus), cheese mites and rotifers. Both books are well written and carry the enthusiasm of the authors. Either would be a great gift for an amateur microscopist.<br /><br /> It is good to see &quot;Discovering the Invisible&quot; back in print. Phalarope Books produced a really neat series of titles for the amateur naturalist and it is now difficult to find most of them. Of these Grave's book is one of the best.<br /><br /> If you are a microscopists or known one this is one of two great introductory texts to choose from (why not get both!)	2004-07-31

I was tempted to buy it, but put it off for a while because I live very far inland and could not justify the purchase.  I later bought it elsewhere, but passed it on to my daughter who lives much closer to a sea coast and gets out there occasionally. I was glad to give it to her because after going over this volume for a few months I can say that this is probably the best first book for anyone interested in marine biology.  It is certainly very beautifully designed and well written.<br /><br />The color plates and great black and white drawings really illustrate this book in a way that is seldom seen in such works. Numerous details are covered in the text that are backed up by the superb illustrations.

It would be hard to find a better introduction to the numerous, yet poorly known, organisms found in every conceivable part of the earth's surface and deep within its oceans and soils. Sagan and Margulis cover everything from viruses to lichens, including such weird life forms as mycoplasmas, methanogens, slime bacteria, crypters, ray beings, slime nets, cellular slime molds, sea whirlers and chytrids.<br /><br /> Sagan and Margulis provide a somewhat dated, but useful, annotated list of references and enough detail about the biology and observation of these organisms to whet the appetite for more. A short chapter on collecting and culturing the microbes is augmented by comments on collection and culture within the discussions of each taxon.<br /><br /> If I have a criticism (other than the fact that the taxonomy is somewhat dated) it would be that the authors should have included a note on safety, as some of the cultures can produce pathogenic organisms. Given these occasional &quot;nasties&quot; it would be worthwhile to emphasize some sanitary precautions. That said, the study of microscopic life is much under rated in the United States (much more popular in Britain!) and perhaps books like &quot;Garden of Microbial Delights,&quot; along with a recently published guide to bacteria, may correct that imbalance. It certainly would not hurt if more people became more aware of the teaming billions of organisms in their world, including a host that we depend on for our very existence. If you are at all interested in the microscopic inhabitants of the real world, even if you are not interested in observing them, you should read this book.	2004-07-27

I tend to view the peninsula that was as the latter and I am saddened by, for example, the loss of tropical hardwood hammock to the ever growing asphalt and concrete jungle that is called greater Miami.<br />Indeed, of the many splendors of the \\"Sunshine State\\" the Everglades is one of the most remarkable.  Made famous by Marjory Stoneman Douglas (who lived to reach 100 years of age), it has at least as much allure as the \\"Big Scrub\\" of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings.  I have seen both, but by the time I saw them they were both much diminished from what they were even fifty years before.<br />Ted Levin eloquently tells the story of the Everglades, its near destruction and attempted restoration in \\"Liquid Land: A Journey Through the Florida Everglades.\\"  It is not a pretty story as it involves many misguided ideas about the \\"grassy waters.\\" These led to the building of miles of canals and dikes and one of the most messed up attempts to tame the untamable in the history of the United States.  Whether the Army Corps of Engineers can restore the Glades to their original splendor is questionable, as they don't even really know what the Everglades were like prior to the end of the 19th Century.  Nobody bothered to record it!  After all it was worthless swamp and jungle to the developers like Napoleon Bonaparte Broward.<br />Levin records this sad history of an underappreciated wilderness reduced to, as Levin says, the artificialness of Disney World by the pumps that try to restore \\"normal\\" flows of water. Besieged by often totally inappropriate development, the Everglades still survive in a much reduced form.  This world was also well described, as well as illustrated by beautiful and haunting photographs as it was in the early 1970s, by Archie Carr in \\"The Everglades\\" (Time-Life Books).<br />A monumental \\"tribute\\" to the short-sightedness and unbelievable hubris of the human species, the story of the Everglades is also one of hope, however slight.  Archie Carr always tried to look on the bright side of the issue and I think we have to do so as much as we can (while not sugar- coating the destruction that has occurred in the past and is still going on today). While a mere shadow of what once was, there are still some areas like Corkscrew Swamp and (if you are very adventurous) the Fakahatchee Strand that are very much worth seeing- especially if you can appreciate swamps.<br />Read Ted Levin's book if you care about the special wild places of this planet!, by Archie Carr in \\"The Everglades\\" (Time-Life Books). <br />A monumental \\"tribute\\" to the short-sightedness and unbelievable hubris of the human species, the story of the Everglades is also one of hope, however slight.

Yet Nachtigall never lets enthusiasm substitute for knowledge.  This is for its shortness a very well-researched book.  The only quibble I could make with it is that the classification of organisms is not up to date (the book was published in 1996), but this is a minor problem, especially considering the huge amount of changes made in our classification schemes over the last few years and the fact that we still are not sure of the ultimate structure of the tree of life.<br />If you are interested in amateur microscopy and can afford only one book, this would be it!	2004-07-06

It is by far the best book to use in the field.  I prefer the artist's illustrations to a totally photographic approach for accurate identification because several aspects of the same species can be shown on a given plate. In addition there are a number of complementary photos of butterflies in natural habitats inserted in the text and distribution maps are placed next to the species descriptions.<br /><br />The discussions are very useful in locating food plants and in confirming field marks and distributions.  Most of the time even tiny lycaenids and difficult skippers are usually identified easily once you get used to the format. All in all this is the book to have for identifying butterflies in the west and it outshines all its competitors for handiness in the field.  Combined with a pair of short-focus binoculars and a good butterfly net for capture and release it just cannot be beaten.<br /><br />I found only one problem with this book, which is also true of other guides.  Occasionally an illustration is slightly off in color or shows a more idealized pattern than seen in the field.  In such cases (especially with some of  the skippers and blues) identification is more difficult.<br /><br />That said if you are a butterfly watcher in the west you really need to own this book!	2004-07-05

The current (7th) edition is revised to fit recent changes in classification and certainly continues the standard set by Borror and DeLong many years ago.  It was never intended to be a text in physiology, behavior or ecology.  There are texts for these subjects available and just covering the systematic aspects of insects thoroughly is enough of a task.<br />My only quibbles have to do with some changes in arrangement of orders that I am not sure of (such as the union of Hemiptera and Homoptera, and Anoplura and Mallophaga - the latter was also true of the 6th ed.) and the fact that scorpion taxonomy was apparently not revised at all, despite numerous changes in the last several years.<br />However, that said, this edition is a continued improvement of a great classic of entomology. Among highlights are Jeremy Miller's and Darrell Ubick's excellent revision of the spider section and the new format for keys to the insects making them easier to use.<br />Without a doubt this will remain the best standard textbook on insect taxonomy available and I recommend it with only the minor reservations noted.	2004-07-05

Why did I think this?  Because there had been an earlier attack on the towers by Islamic extremists and religious fanaticism is more likely to produce self-sacrificing violent deeds than simple greed and power hunger. Religious extremism allows a person to destroy themselves on the promise that they will wake up in paradise.  None of the people around Saddam Hussein were that devoted to the admittedly evil dictator to sacrifice themselves in such a violent act.<br />Charles Kimball's book, \\"When Religion Becomes Evil\\" addresses the problem of corrupted religion and how to recognize it.  He uses five warning signs to define such corruption- claims of absolute truth, demands of blind obedience, establishment of the \\"ideal\\" time, justification of means by the end, and declaration of holy war.  We certainly have enough examples, from the Branch Davidians of David Koresh, to Heaven's Gate and Jim Jones, on through to Osama bin Ladin.  All of these were or are demonstrably pathological.  They all led to death and destruction for their followers and often innocent bystanders.  Others, while not so extreme, are dangerous enough to warrant observation.  These include several organizations of the so-called religious right in this country who often advocate violence indirectly by condemning certain groups that are deemed unworthy or under the control of Satan. As Kimball (who is a Baptist academic) notes exclusionary literal religions can indeed be a danger to democracy and to the general welfare of the society.<br />Is religion the problem?  Kimball correctly, I think, answers yes and no.  Religion is always going to be with us and there will always probably be those who take it to extremes or use it cynically for their own gain, often at the expense of the lives of others.  However, religion may be a human need.  This is not necessarily a seeking for God as some would have it, but a need for meaning in life.  An atheist can be just as ethically good as the best believer and a devote believer can easily be as evil in their actions as the most evil non-believer. We have Schindlers and Gandhis, Communist dictators and inquisitors.  People who saved Jews in Nazi- overrun Europe came from all sorts of belief systems, including atheists, but all had some sort of faith in a moral system. On the other hand, some people who considered themselves truly religious turned in Jews to their destroyers. It is belief in a basic morality, not in a specific doctrine, which makes life bearable.<br />As Kimball points out religion at its best can be very good, while at its worst it reaches depths of depravity seldom seen in simple non-religious disputes. The current hatred between Palestinians and Israelis is a case in point.  Both sides have lost moral authority and I find it difficult at present to have as much sympathy for either side as I would like.<br />While I cannot exactly share Kimball's Christian faith I am impressed with his honest attempt to examine the evils of religious literalism and bigotry. I might add that I do not embrace atheism, but prefer a more ecumenical approach that includes all major religions and non-believers as well.  However, whatever your beliefs, if you want to learn more about the problems of religious exclusivity and literalism associated with hatred and violence, you cannot go wrong by reading \\"When Religion Becomes Evil.\\" Whether you agree with Kimball or not, it will expand your understanding of the difficulties involved in too literal a belief system.use it cynically for their own gain, often at the expense of the lives of others.

The Golden Ratio is just such a concept. Fortunately, Mario Livio has shown much light on this remarkable corner of geometry in his book &quot;The Golden Ratio.&quot;<br />It is little wonder that such numbers as the Golden Ratio were considered magical.  The never ending, never repeating number that cannot ever be expressed as a fraction has an uncanny tendency to show up in the oddest places, not only galactic structure and nautilus shells, but in plant parts and composition of paintings and music.  Unfortunately magical numerology can lead to far-fetched relationships, as to the so-called number of the beast (666), and to academicism in art.  Just because the Golden Ratio results in a pleasing relationship in a composition we are not tied to always measure art on how well it fits that ratio!<br />Livio has illuminated the history of the Golden Ratio in such a way that much of the associated themes can be understood by the reasonably educated laymen.  While some of the book can be tough sledding for most of us non-mathematicians, the gist is available to all with some effort.<br />Read this book to learn about the history of interpretation and misinterpretation of mathematical concepts.	2004-07-02

This is more a sporting competition than natural history or science.  They could just as easily had been train spotting for the largest number of different boxcars.  The goal is of course to record the largest number of bird species seen in one year and they have a tough standard to play against. James Vardaman had recorded 699 birds in 1979, Benton Basham had seen 711 in 1983, Komito himself had gotten 721 in 1987, and Bill Rydell had gotten 714 in 1992.  In 1998 all were trying to beat 721 and all were unbelievably driven.  I won't tell you who won, but it certainly is a remarkable tale indeed!<br />As a sometimes birder who is a professional biologist I understand the thrill of the chase and at least these listers are not killing their quarry.  However, I am a bit astonished at the amount of money and time some of these extreme birders will spend to get over 700 birds on their list in a year.  I have only about 250 birds on my life list (I'm not against listing) and I doubt that I will ever make 500 for my life.<br />The story of their competition to reach over 721 birds in a single year is gripping, but I tend to agree with at least one of the left behind wives that they are also a little bit out of their minds.  Everybody has a right to follow their dream (as long as they don't hurt others in the process) and birding is relatively harmless. I personally would prefer to get to know the birds a bit better than that. Perhaps that is a bit of academic snobbishness, but it is also my individual taste.<br />In any case I recommend this book to anyone who would like to try to understand the drive to record the maximum number of birds seen in a year.	2004-06-30

Victoria Finlay has taken a subject that is very important, but seldom discussed - namely how did we get the colors used by artists for painting - and wove it into a personal account of her travels to find their sources.  In the process she introduces the reader to all manner of exotic and little-known, but delightful facts, peoples and places.  From cochineal (I might note here that as an entomologist I was somewhat discouraged by her apparent inability to decide whether to call the source a beetle or a bug- it is a BUG! - the one clinker in an otherwise well done book), through madder as a source of orange, saffron for yellow, and on to lapis lazuli for blue, etc.  The book is (as noted) also a personal travel narrative with lots of side trips.  I found these to be fascinating and to add interest to a book that might have been a dry compendium of facts about chemicals.<br /><br />\\"Color: A Natural History of the Palette\\" is a good book to curl up with at night or to read on an airplane. The reader will find enough local \\"color\\" and interesting tidbits to make the hours very pleasant indeed.

Daniel Dennett has written (as he calls it) an apologia for determinism in &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; in which he endeavors to reinstate free will in human affairs. In fact he states that the common belief that free will is banished by determinism is dead wrong!  And I think he has succeeded in at least convincing himself that his definition of determinism allows for this seeming slight of hand. I have to note I am in no way a philosopher of science, so I will give here only my opinion of this as a biologist who has specialized in arthropods, and as a rank layman in theoretical evolutionary thought.  I will also note that I tend to agree most with the views of Ernst Mayr on the subject.<br />Mayr quotes Sewall Wright in &quot;Toward a New Philosophy of Biology&quot;, p. 288, as saying &quot;The Darwinian process of continued interplay of a random and a selective process is not intermediate between pure chance and pure determinism, but in its consequences utterly different from either.&quot;  Thus, like the argument between nature and nurture, the issue of determinism vs. indeterminism is at least in part spurious.  Given, however, that there is some reason to discuss this issue at all (it is certainly fascinating) it seems very reasonable that a man as eminently qualified as Daniel Dennett should write this book.  Indeed, Dennett wrote an excellent exposition of the determinist view of evolution in &quot;Darwin's Dangerous Idea.&quot;<br />I have a few bones to pick, however. On p. 25, Dennett uses Van Inwagen's definition for determinism as the thesis that &quot;there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future.&quot;  He goes on to state that determinism thus defined does not imply inevitability. However, most dictionaries state in their definitions that determinism precludes free will.  Is Dennett here redefining the meaning of the word to allow himself the luxury of free will?  To some extent he is- at least the commonly understood meaning.  However, he does so at his peril because words can and do get people into trouble and his detractors have the same privilege!<br />The second bone is the statement by Dennett that he felt the need to write this book because he and his associates (among whom he lists Crick, Watson, Wilson, Dawkins, and Pinker) are often misunderstood and misquoted by colleagues who disagree with &quot;genetic determinism.&quot;  He may have a point about his colleagues (although they have said the same thing about him).  He also notes that there have been &quot;some unfortunate overstatements and over simplifications,&quot;  which have made him and his associates targets (undoubtedly in part because of sensational headlines often associated with them.)  Unfortunately, the press, most politicians, and much of the general public will never understand the nuances of the argument and some don't want to do so for their own reasons!  Beside, some of the people he names as associates, or &quot;responsible, cautious naturalists,&quot; as he calls them (such as Pinker, Dawkins and even Wilson) and other &quot;genetic determinists&quot; that he does not mention (perhaps these, such as Thornhill and Ruse, are irresponsible naturalists?) have made statements in interviews and in their publications that lend themselves directly to sensationalism and criticism by their peers.  He also should not be too surprised that Derk Pereboom (2001) runs with the idea that we have no free will, given the &quot;unfortunate overstatements&quot; of his associates.<br />A third bone is that although Dennett does admit that some of the deterministic ideas can be misused he states that they should not be. However, deterministic ideas based on little solid experimental or historical evidence (such as Pinker's genetic basis for infanticide or Thornhill's male hardwiring for rape) should not be stated as fact, especially when scientists urge their use to set social policy. While Eldredge in his recent book (2004) does not believe that a researcher should hide the truth to avoid unpleasant realities, he does think that they have to be reasonably sure that the view is not a biased untruth.  To paraphrase Mark Twain, it is not what you don't know that causes trouble; it is what you &quot;know&quot; that ain't true!<br />How does Dennett handle his main arguments (including one that quantum theory cannot save us from a deterministic universe)?  Very well, but to me unconvincingly!  To be fair he (among his associates I think a first) points out that hard determinists are faced with a serious dilemma, namely how to give themselves free will while denying it to others!  Dennett also (correctly I think) points out the rather flawed idea of using labels, such as &quot;genetic determinist.&quot;  I wish Steven Pinker had been as careful about the &quot;blank slate&quot; idealists (environmental determinists)!<br />However, Dennett reinstates free will by (I think) a mechanistic slight of hand (I might add that this slight of hand could be how the universe works!)  He dismisses quantum effects (I think the jury is still out on that one - perhaps Roger Penrose is wrong, but we shall see!) as weakening the ability to reach a free will decision and thus defeating the very process it seeks to validify.  In essence, as near as I can tell, he reinstates free will as being a necessary byproduct of deterministic processes.<br />In closing, I think Dennett's book is well worth reading, despite my disagreements with him.  Some of his arguments I feel unqualified to judge and in any case I may be wrong in my criticisms. He certainly brings up numerous interesting points and articulately defends his position.  I remain, however, somewhat skeptical.  After wading over the years through books by Dawkins, Ruse, Wilson, Gould, Eldredge, Lewontin, Pinker, Mayr, Williams, Barash, Diamond, Lorenz and Dennett (not to mention the more popular, but also more sensationalistic  writers Ardrey and Morris) I am getting a bit tired of the debate.

Niles Eldredge has now written, I think, a nearly perfect rebuttal to the currently popular, but often undocumented, \\"selfish gene\\" view of human nature in his new book \\"Why we do it.\\"<br />It is obvious to Eldredge that humans are animals.  Indeed it has been known since at least the time of the early Greeks that humans were animals.  This is thus not a new discovery, whatever the evolutionary psychologists may claim.  It is, however, also true that we (and indeed all organisms) are more than the sum of our genes.  Sure there is a \\"Human Nature.\\"  Sure we are not born with a \\"Blank Slate\\" personality, infinitely malleable.  We are, however, more plastic in our behavior than the extreme \\"selfish gene\\" concept would allow.  We have to have some plasticity in our behavior because we live in a complex society that requires cooperation. It seems to me that our ability to cooperate is thus as much a part of our nature as our \\"baser instincts.\\"  The question that scientists should ask is not whether murder, rape, thievery, and carnage characterize humans, but why most people do not participate in these antisocial activities!<br />Eldredge touches on many of these problems in his new book, especially in regard to sex and economics. By economics he means the functions (ingestion of food, drinking water, respiration, digestion, elimination of wastes and undigested food) that allow the organism to survive.  Without survival there is no reproduction.  In his characteristically clear prose he does a good job of demolishing the strict genetic determinist view of human behavior.  Indeed, the so-called genetic determinists are not quite so deterministic in their real lives or in the details of their writing.  So-called \\"blank slate\\" proponents (\\"environmental determinists\\") are often equally closer to \\"genetic determinists\\" than they or their rivals would like to admit.  Much of the hype about human nature being the determinant of every human action, or conversely nurture being paramount, comes from the popular press and the profit motive (ah- proof of human basic depravity!)<br />Actually I have quite a bit of respect for (although I don't always agree with) many researchers often lumped as evolutionary psychologists, sociobiologists, or ultra-Darwinists (as Eldredge characterizing them).  Of these, works by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Daniel Dennett and John Alcock are especially worth reading.  Again one has to be careful in characterizing individuals in one \\"school\\" of thought as being always in lockstep every other \\"member.\\" My main gripe is that when some sociobiologists or evolutionary psychologists get carried away by their own rhetoric they will often resort to value-laden anthropomorphic prose (words do matter!), extrapolation beyond their data, and refusal to present valid counter arguments and evidence.  Such works, whether based on right or left-leaning political perspectives are nothing more than polemics, and while far too common, have no valid place in science. Despite human failings, the goal of science should be to approach to the closest approximation of reality as possible.  Darwin would be appalled by the lack of honest debate often shown in such works!  In his \\"Origin of Species,\\" Darwin summarized and answered (or admitted the apparent validity) of numerous criticisms of his theory.<br />An example of a spacious argument for a rather bestial human nature is the hypothesis that a tendency to rape is an adaptive feature of human males.  I think Eldredge does an especially good job of demolishing this view, based on a critical review written by Frans de Waal. In fact, most rapes do not occur with reproduction in mind as many (if not most) rape victims are either above or below the age of reproduction.  Also (although Eldredge mentions it only in passing) many women die as a result of the attack (as the number of young women murdered over the last few years in Juarez testifies), especially in war time. If rape causes pregnancy the fetus is often aborted or the baby is put up for adoption, as noted by Eldredge.  When criticized about the fact that rape is obviously currently maladaptive (many, but unfortunately not most, rapists wind up in jail), proponents fall back on the view that it must have evolved back in Pleistocene times, when it was adaptive!  How this could ever be documented, short of inventing a time machine, is beyond me.

He often goes on delightful side trips (a mark of a skillful writer, as such devices can be dangerous to an essay) and rarely (but occasionally) follows the wrong path.  Whether you agree with him or not, he is always thought provoking.<br />&quot;The Lying Stones of Marrakech&quot; is no exception.  Another one of his series of books of essays from his column &quot;This View of Life&quot; in NATURAL HISTORY magazine, the essays deal with a number of fascinating biological subjects from fake fossils (the lying stones mentioned in the title) to measuring evolution in the real world.  While some editing might have made this book even better, it is still a very good read and certainly thought inspiring.<br />Gould is often especially forceful in dealing with biological determinism, as in the (I think) false idea that we are totally what our genes make us.  Now to be fair there are few proponents of evolutionary psychology or other biological determinist groups that would make such a statement (just as there are few total blank slate idealists, despite Stephan Pinker's views), but the ideas often expressed by such researchers make one wonder exactly where they are leading. From the &quot;killer ape&quot; mentality to the &quot;naturalness of rape&quot; they often tread close to a position that man is not improvable and so why bother?<br />There are almost no modern scientists (as Gould points out) who would deny genetic influence on behavior.  Certain mental diseases, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, have obvious genetic components. Nor would they deny that we are an evolutionary product of our ancestors Pliocene and Pleistocene environments (and even earlier ones).  However, humans exhibit a remarkably plastic behavioral ability, which is also evolutionarily derived.  What makes us human is exactly that plasticity.  Given the current state of the planet we had better hope that we can rise above the pre-civilized part of our brains and alter our collective behavior- otherwise we are dead as a species!<br />These and other fascinating (and often obscure) biological issues are grist for Gould's mill.  To follow his interest in the national sport he even throws in a few short pieces on baseball.  Essays on the difficulties of predicting the future of technology, the contributions of Lamark, the career of the great French naturalist Buffon, and how vulva stones became brachiopods (they always were of course!), are also among those in this collection.<br />This book is well worth the reading, despite the digressions!of the planet we had better hope that we can rise above the pre-civilized part of our brains and alter our collective behavior- otherwise we are dead as a species! <br />These and other fascinating (and often obscure) biological issues are grist for Gould's mill.

He takes us through the Beat, Hippie, and New Age movements to the present, more mature, spiritual association with Eastern philosophy and Buddhism in particular. While not a deep book, it does give some insight into the history of the Buddhist movement in the United States and why Buddhism is as popular as it is now.  To a large degree this popularity is due to the common sense approach of Buddhism to every day life and the unspectacular claims it makes. It also does not require exact literal belief and is thus quite open to science. In essence we are told that there is nothing to be gained because we have the ability for enlightenment within each of us.  We need only connect to that awareness within. Despite this apparent simplicity, the practice of Buddhist meditation is far from easy.  It requires commitment that takes time to develop, yet is open to everyone.<br />I do not agree with Nisker on every detail (it would be unusual if I did).  For example, I'm not sure that I would quite give the blank check he gives to the evolutionary psychologists. This is, however,  a minor quibble. I don't expect him to be one with all of the scientific arguments of the day.<br />All in all this book is a very enjoyable read and I very much recommend it to be read if you are on an airplane as I was when I read it.	2004-05-29

The second edition was published in 1978 and the fact that it is still in print indicates its utility.<br />When used with Kudo's &quot;Protozology&quot; and the more recent &quot;Free-Living Freshwater Protozoa: A Color Guide&quot; by D. J. Patterson, along with a phase-contrast compound microscope, almost any known protozoan can be determined to genus.  Even with simpler equipment most can be reasonably placed to genus.  Phase contrast is useful to more easily see some of the characters, such as cilia and cirri.<br />In general, this is a very user friendly book (as are most, if not all, of the books in the &quot;How to Know&quot; series.)  Some sections that are especially useful include those on protozoan sizes (absolutely necessary in most cases), drawing protozoans, and motion in protozoans. The illustrations are generally very good and clearly show characters needed to identify a specimen. The descriptions are equally clear and helpful. In addition, specialized terms are defined in the index, a very useful innovation as you only have to look them up once!<br />If you are interested at all in microscopic organisms, either as a professional or an amateur, this book is a must for your library.	2004-05-24

My very first book on insects was in this series and I wore out numerous copies of the various titles.  Of these I have always especially admired H. W. and Lorna Levi's &quot;Spiders and Their Kin.&quot;  This little guide had (and to a large degree still has) the most complete systematic treatment of any of the taxa covered in the \\"Golden Guide\\" series.  Few books were available on these fascinating creatures when this work was originally published and &quot;Spiders and Their Kin&quot; was a considerable improvement. The drawings of spider eye arrangements were especially helpful for identification.<br />Unfortunately time does not stand still and the reprinted version of this book is somewhat behind in its treatment of spider families.  There has been some attempt by St. Martin's Press to revise the classification (the sac spiders are shown to belong to several families), but some of the other families have also undergone major changes (e.g. \\"Ctenizidae\\" is now at least three families) and &quot;brown spiders&quot; (a name I really do not like- I prefer &quot;violin spiders&quot; as more descriptive) are now members of the Sicariidae.  Neither of the last two changes made it into the revised book, either because they occurred after the corrected copy was submitted or because they were overlooked.  The current revision does include the statement that urocteids and oecobiids have been united under the Oecobiidae - as it turns out, having a cribellum is a primitive trait and does not indicate relationships very well- but mistakenly indicates that the \\"oecobiids\\" are larger than \\"urocteids\\". It also still has the two \\"families\\" on different pages, so the revision did not include a rearrangement of the figures. In the scorpions there have been major taxonomic changes as well, but most of these were not noted (again several are probably just too recent to have been included).  However, Hadrurus is correctly placed in the Iuridae, instead of the Vaejovidae.<br />Because of these major developments I cannot recommend this book as an up to date guide to currently recognized spider families, but it still is a good starting place for those (especially young people) who would like to know more about arachnids, millipedes, centipedes, and land crustaceans. Fortunately many, if not most, of the families (e. g. Theraphosidae, Oonopidae, Salticidae, Linyphiidae, Selenopidae, Theridiidae, Araneidae, Tetragnathidae, Lycosidae) are still valid as described in the original edition of the book.rrectly placed in the Iuridae, instead of the Vaejovidae.<br />Because of these major developments I cannot recommend this book as an up to date guide to currently recognized spider families, but it still is a good starting place for those (especially young people) who would like to know more about arachnids, millipedes, centipedes, and land crustaceans.

I wanted to get some flavor of the island's history and had skimmed through a dozen or so titles before I settled on this one.  I was not disappointed.  Lindley S. Butler has captured the marine lore of the Outer Banks in a well written and researched book.  &quot;Pirates, Privateers, and Rebel Raiders of the Carolina Coast&quot; chronicles, without sensationalism, the often bloody careers of eight of the most important personalities of the days of pirates, the War of 1812 and the Civil War.  All, from the pirate Blackbeard to the Confederate raider James I. Waddell, are shone in realistic fashion. I was much impressed by both the wealth of sources listed and with the easy reading style of this work. It made a great read during my flight from Raleigh-Durham to El Paso. This is, in my opinion as a non-historian, the way histories should be written to make them more accessible to the layman. I have to also give my compliments to the University of North Carolina Press for publishing this excellent account, which stands out among any number of books on pirates and privateers.<br />If you visit the coast of either North or South Carolina and wish to know more about the rich local history, you cannot go wrong in reading Butler's volume on the subject!	2004-05-15

Biologists have to a great degree ignored the strange world of quantum physics.  As Chet Raymo (actually an Astronomer) observes it is difficult to see how quantum effects could really touch the scale at which we function. Raymo in fact believes that such effects may cancel each other out at our scale. I think, however, that this may be a narrow, if comfortable, view.  Roger Penrose has proposed that consciousness itself may be a quantum effect and Johnjoe McFadden believes that quantum effects may very well have bearing on the evolution of life.  As a biologist I am struck with the inability of scientists to actually define life, other than by the reductionist view that it is a series of chemical processes.  There are in fact many chemical processes that are not life and so this does not quite satisfy.<br />However, this is not to get into heavy metaphysics or to take on some mystical view of life.  It is, however, to acknowledge the basic weirdness of life that fits, it seems to me, into the weirdness of the quantum universe. I suspect that future scientists will discover that life has more to it than fits the conventional view. But then our view of the universe, including life, has always changed with new insights and I doubt that we have (or will ever) reach full understanding of it all.<br />Jim Al Khalili has caught the excitement of the old and new developments in quantum theory in &quot;Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed.&quot;  Once you get past the somewhat glitzy format, you find a solid and fascinating description of the extremely weird quantum world in which matter acts like waves and waves act like matter and in which mere observation can and does change results.  The extreme weirdness of Bell's theorem and entrainment soon make the reader realize almost against their will that we live not in the neat ordered universe envisioned by Newton or even Einstein, but in the much stranger world of entrainment and &quot;chance&quot; events.  To top it all off we discover that the brain may be a &quot;quantum computer&quot; that functions in ways quite different from the desk top computers that we use every day.<br />If you thought the universe made perfect sense read this book and be disillusioned!f we discover that the brain may be a &quot;quantum computer&quot; that functions in ways quite different from the desk top computers that we use every day.<br />If you thought the universe made perfect sense read this book and be disillusioned!	2004-04-29

We think of clothes moths, tomato hornworm moths, cutworms, armyworms, bollworms, codling moths and the like before we think of io moths, luna moths, underwings or tiger moths.  Butterflies, their daytime cousins (although as Himmelman points out there are a fair number of day-flying moths) are much more loved and studied.<br />John Himmelman, in writing &quot;Discovering Moths: Nighttime Jewels in Your Own Backyard,&quot; has done much to redress this imbalance.  His drawings and excellent photographs make this book a work of aesthetic beauty as well as a fascinating read.<br />Himmelman also discusses an interesting trend- the study of living insects, such as butterflies and dragonflies, has started to become at least as popular as collecting the same insects (in butterflies more so!). He sees a similar trend (but much slower) for moths.  The last chapter of his book is in fact one of the better discussions of the ethics of taking of insect life for science or pleasure that I've ever read.  While he does not like collecting himself, he understands the impulse, as well as the scientific interest.  Unlike many butterflies (except skippers and some lycaenids - I know this from much experience as I am a participant and also an editor for the 4th of July Butterfly Count of the North American Butterfly Association), it is often difficult to identify moths (although it can be done to a degree). This is partly because of the shear number of species involved (11,000 species of moths in North America as opposed to about 700 or so butterflies), partly because of the similarity of many closely related moth species and partly because not all moths are yet known. Thus judicious collecting has its place.  Still I have always thought in my more reflective moods that collecting should be only a prelude to study of the living insect. Like Himmelman I cannot condemn collecting (I am currently curating a collection of over 100,000 specimens at a state university and I was at one time an avid tiger beetle collector) but I do think that observation has a place and that place should be more exulted than it often is, without putting down the continuing contribution of the collector and taxonomist.<br />This is a great book for the entomologist and especially for those who like to explore new areas within the subject.  There are unfortunately few books on moths. We are still awaiting a guide to western moths to match the Peterson Field Guide to the eastern species, and the Moth Book, by Holland, is way out of date- although still charming.

Illustrated with beautiful color photos, many by the author, this is the ultimate guide to every conceivable insect or other arthropod you might find in your backyard.  It also tells you what to expect from each of these creatures (will it eat my rose bushes?)<br /><br />I first bought a copy for the Arthropod Museum library and then, after using the book for a few days, ordered my own copy. It is well written and authoritative (Whitney Cranshaw is a respected entomologist at Colorado State University) and very well illustrated.  Color plates of stinkbugs, scale insects, aphids, beneficial insects etc. give the reader a fantastic overview of the variety of arthropods they can find around their own homes.  The price is also very good ($20.00 for a thick book with hundreds of color photos is remarkable today!) and I simply cannot see how anyone interested in gardening or backyard bug watching would not want a copy.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone with a reason to know anything about the numerous six and eight-legged creatures beyond their back door.	2004-04-08

Anything written by Robert Desowitz is always a worthwhile read and his most recent (and sadly, last) book, \\"Federal Bodysnatchers and the New Guinea Virus: Tales of Parasites, People, and Politics,\\" is no exception.  His expertise on human infectious diseases is impressive and thorough.  He discusses the little known behind the scenes intrigues involved with the attempts to deal with malaria, West Nile virus, sleeping sickness, and several others.  He also discusses the effects of global warming on the spread of infectious diseases and the roll of DDT in suppressing malaria specifically.<br />His earlier book \\"The Malaria Capers\\" (1991) should be read to completely understand the political and even criminal problems that developed within the malaria vaccine research program.  These problems landed some researchers in jail and certainly have added little or nothing to the development of a real vaccine.  The vaccine is tough to produce (over 70 years has so far been spent on the search) because of the fact that Plasmodium falciparum (the main target of vaccines as it is the main, if not sole cause of death from malaria) is a much more complicated organism than the viruses and bacteria that are usually the target.  Because of its complex life cycle and ability to avoid antibodies and parasite-killing cells, malaria soon escapes any vaccine so far developed.  A Colombian researcher is supposed to have a 100% effective vaccine, but Desowitz is rightly skeptical.  As I have not heard of the vaccine being a success, I will have to agree.<br />The problems with DDT discussed by Desowitz demonstrate that there are no easy ways out.  DDT was banned for agricultural use pretty much worldwide within a decade or so of the publication of \\"Silent Spring.\\" It has since been used for malaria control in many tropical countries and has been more than a little effective, even though resistance had built up in mosquitoes in many areas (Desowitz notes that some researchers think that resistance was helped by the huge amounts of DDT used in agriculture).  There is little doubt that DDT was an ecological disaster when it was broadcasted throughout the environment. However, there is a movement to ban it even for anti-malarial use and Desowitz thinks that this may be wrong-headed.  I am not sure about this, but I have to admit that it is not my children that are at stake (at least for the present time!) However, if global warming continues (and neither Desowitz nor I am under any illusion that it will not) we may be staring at a lot of new and old diseases (including malaria- which has already made some incursions) that we never thought possible in the United States. Then we may sing a different tune!<br />This book should be read by everyone concerned about emerging diseases, whether brought by terrorists or (much more likely) by human movement and trade.  It should also open anyone's eyes to the lack of efficiency of many organizations charged with the protection of world and national health.esistance was helped by the huge amounts of DDT used in agriculture).

The slime molds are generally little noticed, but very strange life forms that could easily fit in a science fiction book.  The swarm cells and myxamoebae unite to form first an amoeboid zygote, then the strange, crawling, plasmodium stage, and finally the fungus-like fruiting body. The plasmodia can be (in the case of Fuligo) large yellow pulsating crawling blobs that suddenly appear on people's lawns.  Others are less noticeable, but often brightly colored.  I have seen one of these plasmodia in my life- a bright pink blob that disappeared into the ground when I raised a rotting log in the Pinaleno Mountains of Arizona.  I was certainly startled!<br />Stephenson and Stempen have written an excellent book on these strange critters in \\"Myxomycetes: A Handbook of Slime Molds.\\"  It fills a gap in the literature on natural history.  It is my hope that more people will be able to appreciate these neat organisms through the descriptions, excellent line drawings and well-rendered color plates.<br />I will disagree with one reviewer's dislike of the describer's name after the scientific name, however.  It is there for the convenience of other taxonomist as least as much as the vanity of the describer. If I know that Physarum nutans was described by Persoon it tells me something about where I should look for the original description and may also give me some idea of when the name probably originated. Also Physarum cinereum (Batsch) Persoon tells me that Batsch wrote the original description, but placed the species in a different genus, which was than changed to the present genus by Persoon.  Thus such \\"vain\\" additions are often important to other workers in the field.<br />I do agree with the same reviewer that some further discussion of how slime molds are classified might have helped an otherwise excellent book. However,  I am also fully aware that the classification is still in flux and no final answers may yet be possible until DNA studies are done (and maybe not even then!).<br />Read this book if you find the weirdness of the world fascinating!  Better still, use it to find and identify slime molds.  Good hunting.hen!).<br />Read this book if you find the weirdness of the world fascinating!

John Acorn's \\"Tiger Beetles of Alberta: Killers on the Clay, Stalkers on the Sand\\" is one of those rare books that incorporate accurate information and enthusiasm, plus fantastically beautiful illustrations.  This is a book that ANY tiger beetler should own- even if they don't live in Alberta.  Seventeen of the nineteen species that Acorn describes are also found in New Mexico and I suspect that this book will serve well for our north central tier of states.  While collecting is mentioned, Acorn goes further- toward an appreciation of the living tiger beetle and its behavior.<br />John Acorn is in a class by himself.  I was first introduced to his TV program \\"The Nature Nut\\" at a meeting of the American Arachnological Society in Tucson, Arizona. The episode \\"Scorpions: They're Real Cool\\" was the hit of our informal slide and film show. It made me search out and buy as many of his arthropod shows as I could find.  Between his expertise and his dry humor he is one of the few people that I've encountered who can totally enthrall audiences from kindergarten to retirement. I later met him in person at a meeting in Rio Rico, Arizona, and found him to be as open and interesting to talk to as I thought he would be.<br />I could find only minor errors in his tiger beetle book (mostly nit-picking errors of omission in tiger beetle ranges for a few- like C. longilabris and C. pupurea in the New Mexico part of their ranges) and the amount of information he packs into this slim volume is astounding.<br />I recommend this book highly if you have any interest in tiger beetles, or just like beautiful things!	2004-03-22

I was looking for a good book on the elements over the last few years and kept drawing a blank.  The few I found were too technical, too simple, or involved strange treatments.  Than I found this book!  It was exactly what I wanted.  A complete treatment of the elements of the periodic table alphabetically arranged. When I first found it I thought I would test it out by checking a rather obscure biological fact- certain tunicates (ascidians) concentrate vanadium in their blood. On p. 486 I found the reference with one error- Ascidia was called a &quot;worm&quot; (it is a Urochordate).  However, the author made up for this by noting under copper that snails, spiders, octopi and oysters utilize that element as part of an oxygen-carrying blood pigment, making their blood pale blue.<br />Other entries were just as fascinating.  The sections for each element cover such subjects as human involvement (biologically- including food and medicine), history, economics, environmental associations, chemical properties and &quot;Element of Surprise&quot; - little known facts regarding the element in question.<br />Where else could you find the origin of Teflon, the history of lead, the use of a salt of nitrogen to inflate airbags, or that thorium oxide was injected into patients during early X-ray diagnosis?  These, and a host of other facts, are presented in exacting detail in &quot;Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements.&quot;<br />This is a very much-needed book for anybody requiring a good reference on the chemical elements.

Betsey Dexter Dyer has written a book in &quot;A Field Guide to Bacteria&quot; that, once it is opened, you wonder why no one has written before.  The premise is so obvious that it seems to have been totally overlooked! Location, visual appearance, activity, smell and other characteristics that do not always require a high-powered microscope can be used to identify bacterial colonies! Fortunately the &quot;wait&quot; for such a book (which, until now, we probably did not even know we needed) has been worth it because Dyer has done an excellent job of writing it!  In this book she introduces the reader to the teaming microflora of bacteria of earth in a way that cannot help but increase the number of people who appreciate these invisible true owners of the planet.<br />The huge bacterial flora is well covered and the author's grasp of the multitudinous habitats where bacteria live and thrive, sometimes under the most extreme conditions, is impressive.  Everything from sulfur bacteria, halophytes and causes of desert varnish to internal symbionts and more are covered in fascinating detail.  Dyer has opened up a whole new way of looking at the world that give us a more accurate view of the pervasiveness of the tiny.  Not all bacteria are out to get us by any means and this book provides a much needed balance to the &quot;killer bacteria&quot; usually featured in popular literature.<br />A necessary book for amateur and even professional microbiologists, it will also, I think, provide a good read for anyone interested in the natural world as it really is.	2004-02-22

Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee have written a very thought-provoking book in \\"Rare Earth.\\"  They have, in fact, given voice to some thoughts that had occurred to me and to a lot of others quite some time ago - namely \\"Where is everybody?\\"  Flying saucer enthusiasts and alien abduction aficionados aside, most of us who think about such things have wondered why no alien civilization's radio transmissions have not obviously reached planet earth by now if alien civilizations were so common. Also we are starting to wonder where life exists in our solar system outside of Earth.<br /><br />When I was in my teens I eagerly kept track of every launch of a spacecraft.  I dreamed of even becoming an astronomer specializing in planetary geology. But my true love was biology and the thought of a possible alien biological system was fascinating.  I was soon disillusioned.  First the veil of Venus was lifted and where swamps and dinosaur-like creatures roamed in science fiction was a barren acid and heat scorched version of Dante's Inferno.  Mars was also found to be a volcanic version of the earth's moon, except with weather (dust storms mostly), pole caps of carbon dioxide and water ice, and a very thin atmosphere.  The temperature of close to 100 degrees F. below zero did not seem promising and still does not. Thus the civilizations of Mars envisioned by Lowell disappeared into the Martian dust (as they had started to even before the first space probes).  Then the moons Titan (Saturn) and Europa (Jupiter) were proposed as abodes of life, however weird, and a Martian meteorite with strange \\"nano-bacteria\\" was brought out.  The latter \\"nano-bacteria\\" have become dubious at best and the moons are looking less promising by the day. Titan may have such a smoggy atmosphere and be so cold as to be certainly questionable as an abode for life.  In addition to this, recent reports indicate that Europa is covered with a layer of concentrated sulfuric acid (possibly from the neighboring moon Io, which has sulfur volcanoes on its surface) and hydrogen peroxide- not exactly a good place for living things!  To top it off some scientists think that the ice on Europa may actually cover a sea of sulfuric acid with a pH close to 0!<br /><br />If we cannot find even \\"primitive\\" to relatively \\"primitive\\" living things (bacteria, lichens, fungi) on other planets in our system we may have to face the fact that life, while it may exist on numerous planets, is not nearly as common and as accessible as some would have it and that \\"civilizations\\" are even less common.<br /><br />Why is this?  Ward and Brownlee have provided detailed answers, which, even if their formulae are somewhat flawed (as one reviewer suggested), are persuasive.  We have to keep in mind that we do not know how long civilizations last or how often they occur but do not develop our type of technology.  We are up against billion of years of time and trillions of cubic light years of space.  Star Trek aside, we are not even sure that interstellar travel will ever be possible, so we may never know for sure what is out there.<br /><br />As Ward and Brownlee point out, to even have a planet with the possibility of life we have to have several conditions met. First planets revolving around multiple stars probably do not last long because of tidal effects and if they do life might have to cope with radical changes in surface temperature.  Given that, we still have a number of candidate stars and have even found a number of such stars with planets (most of which are huge, some even by Jupiter standards). We also need planets within a star's habitable zone (assuming the star is not unstable and lasts long enough for the development of life). Then contingency has to allow for the development of living forms sometime during the life of the planet.  To get more complex life than bacteria we need several billion years and perhaps a large moon.  It gets even dicier if we want intelligent life, and even thenwe may have intelligent ocean-dwelling creatures who never develop radio and thus may not be detectable.  Even if radio waves are produced by a civilization, we need to exist ourselves within that civilization's survival time frame (or actually light years later).<br /><br />Ward and Brownlee have provided, I think, some very good reasons why we are unlikely to find multicellular life on nearby planets or advanced technologies on planets even around distant stars. Even if life is fairly abundant in the universe (and I think it probably may be), planets with life (even at the bacterial level) may not be anywhere near as abundant as lifeless ones. This is not a reason to embrace creationism, as some would have it, but is simply a property of our universe.  While I wish it were not so, I fear we cannot argue with the logic of this- especially with the little evidence we now possess. Of course one cannot completely rule out the possibility that Ward and Brownlee have missed something, but that is a present a meager hope.<br /><br />Read this book if you are interested in why complex life may be uncommon in the universe.dwelling creatures who never develop radio and thus may not be detectable.

I read his \\"365 Starry Nights\\" with a fascination that I have had for few books.  After reading Kenneth Miller's \\"Finding Darwin's God\\" I was quite receptive to getting Raymo's take on the interface between science and religion in his book \\"Skeptics and True Believers.\\"  I was not disappointed.  Raymo's thesis is that there needs to be a connection between religion and science that does not contradict solid scientific results and concepts. Raymo is clear in his writing and, among other things, rightly attacks the muddled postmodern concept that all ideas are equal. You cannot argue that Ptolemy's construct of epicycles is as good an idea as Copernicus' sun-centered system. This is utter nonsense. Science at its best does seek the closest approximation of \\"truth\\" at a given time and is also at its best a self-correcting system.  Thus you cannot really have a conservative or liberal science.  The Nazis tried to have an Aryan science and the Communists in the former Soviet Union tried to have a Socialist science, but they both failed miserably. This inability to be ultimately used for political purposes is one of the main strengths of science and what separates it from absolute belief systems.<br />Raymo also takes on strict reductionism, which is (as he points out) pretty close to a faith-, a faith that you can explain the universe in a final relatively simple theory of everything.  Even Stephen Hawking has apparently given up on this idea (although he espoused it quite emphatically in his \\"A Brief History of Time.\\")  The problem is the mind-boggling complexity of the universe and of the development and structure of life.  Still, reductionism has served us well in the laboratory- it just does not take on the biggest problems easily.  Perhaps one day we will know everything there is to know, but I think that we will be buried in mountains of data long before that day dawns.<br />I do partially disagree with Raymo on one point.  While I think that he is absolutely correct that quantum physics cannot be used to \\"prove\\" the existence of God or of a spirit world, the chance effects of quantum theory could serve a basis for free will, as Roger Penrose suggests.  I am not convinced that quantum events never affect events at larger scales, as Raymo thinks.  However only time and more knowledge will settle that one.  It may be, as Raymo says, that quantum events are swamped at larger scales.  It may even be that at our level apparently indeterminate events become determinant if an infinite number of these events are summed.  This is the \\"coin tossing\\" paradox- we cannot predict the outcome of a particular coin toss, but if you make a large number of tosses the ratio will be nearly 50-50 and if you made an infinite number the 50-50 ratio would be absolutely determined.  However, I think that dispensing with free will completely (as some recent authors do, but Raymo does not) makes a mockery of science itself, as its practitioners than become automatons who are deluded into believing that they chose their views.<br />I will add one other quibble.  Although I, as an agnostic, pretty much agree with Raymo, I still would hesitate to attack someone else's faith in a personal God.  For one thing, while I would not depend on any ancient holy text as a source of truth, I am not going to tell a grieving parent that their child is not in a biblical heaven if that should give them comfort.  Beside, I think that religious belief is to some extent probably a characteristic of the human species and may not easily be eliminated by all the science education we can provide.  Why some believe or do not believe in a particular version of God is not easy to discover. However, I think it may be a result of the genetic makeup of humans interacting with their culture and apparent need for answers.<br />None the less, I agree with Raymo that it is important for scientists to explain the logic and evidence for their theories to the public.  We just cannot expect everybody to immediately see scientific \\"truth\\" as THE truth, and modify their beliefs over night. Humans (including scientists sometimes) are really good at ignoring evidence against some cherished belief.  We also need to avoid the trap of scientific hegemony over religion and the humanities in which science itself becomes god and other human endeavors, such as art, literature and music, are dismissed as \\"unscientific.\\"<br />Read this book if you are at all interested in the subject of the relationship of science and religion.  Even if you do not agree with Raymo, it will cause you to think about a very important subject that may well determine mans future survival.evidence for their theories to the public.

Needham, if he were alive today, would be proud. The book is the new standard for all odontologists in North America.  It is, indeed, difficult for me to criticize this monumental tome because it simply stands alone in its class. A wealth of new information collected by co-authors Westfall and May has enriched the description of the Anisoptera fauna to the point that dragonflies are now, after butterflies and perhaps some popular beetle and moth families, the best known group of insects in the continent.  These creatures are well worth getting to know, as a recent handbook for binocular study and several more past and recent handbooks on local faunas (Florida and California) attest.<br />If you are seriously interested in the Odonata and do not already have this book you should order it as soon as you can afford it.

In it, Kenneth Miller argues that the very contingency of the universe allows for the existence of a personal God.  I can go most of the way with him on this, but not the whole way.<br />Miller is absolutely correct in the chapters where he pretty well demolishes the young earth creationists, the old earth creationists and the intelligent design creationists.  I have seen very few books (notable those of Pennock such as \\"Tower of Babel\\") with a more closely argued case against the creationists (or Intelligent Design theorists as some now characterize themselves).  I also am impressed with Miller's grasp of the contingency of the development of life.  While Stephen Jay Gould may have gotten the Burgess shale fauna wrong, I think that he was quite right about the contingency of the evolution of life on this planet.  There is no a priori reason to believe as some (notably Gould's b&eacute;te noire Simon Conway Morris) that humans (or something like them) would be the result of every evolutionary history.  Miller to his credit not only admits, but also embraces the concept of contingency, while noting that Gould did not invent the idea.  He also, unfortunately in my view, embraces the strong anthropic principle, which implies that the universe has such favorable conditions for life that it must have been created with life, including intelligent life, in mind, despite contingency.  I see no real scientific evidence for this.  However I will be the first to admit that I cannot rule it out completely.  Unlike true believers in creationism or scientific determinism I just do not know for certain!<br />At the same time I agree with Miller that one cannot simply explain religion away as either a now unnecessary adaptation (as E. O. Wilson does) or as a result of the evolution of the \\"mental modular\\" construction of the brain (as Steven Pinker does).  Miller notes, correctly I believe, that such an argument could be turned against science.  After all are not E. O. Wilson and Steven Pinker only doing what their genes tell them to do when writing such ideas?  How can you trust either their views on the subject or those of creationists, who struggle to fit literal reality into the Bible's obvious contradictions?<br />Thus, like Miller, I am not happy with the out and out atheism of Richard Dawkins and several other evolutionary determinists.  I do not share Miller's exact belief in God, but I do agree with him that there is no proof that God does not exist (although I doubt that any god would be necessarily the Jehovah of the Bible). I (for what it is worth) in fact agree most with Buddhism that the existence of a god or gods is not an answerable question.  The most important question for a human being in this view is \\"How ought I to live?\\"  That said, the antipathy of such evolutionists as Dawkins and Dennett toward any religious view only exacerbates the rather damaging war between fundamentalists and science and often alienates moderate believers.  When you cannot prove what you believe to be true it is best to remain humble and not insist on adherence by everybody else (this goes, I think, for both the Biblical literalists and scientific determinists, who, like far right-wing and far left-wing politicians resemble each other in the structure of their respective dogmas).<br />However one views it, Miller has written a very thought-provoking volume.  It puts in question both religious fundamentalist literalism and ultra-reductionist determinism.  At the same time it allows us to embrace the indeterminate mystery that is this remarkable universe in which we live.e.  After all are not E. O.

The study of freshwater organisms has gained in importance as we see our precious water resources become more scarce and polluted.  As water flows downhill it takes with it every chemical and waste product we deposit on the surface.  Fresh water (and marine) organisms are a first line of defense alerting us to the destruction.  The presence or absence of many of these organisms is often significant in regard to water quality and environmental health.<br />In addition, there is increased interest in our freshwater systems and their biota, both among professionals and knowledgeable amateurs.  The lack of funding and specialists in certain areas for the needed research in aquatic systems may make the role of the latter more important with time, as has already occurred in astronomy and to a lesser degree in other areas of study.<br />This book is a good summery of aquatic organisms from Protozoa to Arthropoda.  Despite a few irritating typos, it compares well with earlier editions of Pennak's &quot;Freshwater Invertebrates of the United States&quot; in coverage (the 4th edition of Pennak drops both the protoctists and the insects, while retaining the non-insect arthropods and including some color illustrations).  If one can afford them they are both worth having, but for reasonably up-to-date overall coverage and inclusiveness and at a cheaper price, Thorp and Covich (eds.) book is a good reference for all Canadian and U. S. freshwater invertebrates in the very broad sense.	2004-01-23

These are now known to contain several quite different organisms from Euglena to Chara and from diatoms to desmids and Spirogyra.  The flora is huge and often poorly known.  Thus it was with some enthusiasm that I welcomed the publication of this massive tome.  A much-needed updating of Smith's classic book and more, it contains numerous black and white photos and drawings, plus extensive bibliographies for each chapter. I also much appreciate the keys, having been involved in writing several for spider genera.  The only down side is the rather high price, which is quite a bit more than its companion volume on freshwater invertebrates.<br />I don't fault this book for lack of color because that might have easily made it even more expensive.  If you want to see color photos of algae, and indeed very good ones, try &quot;Freshwater Algae: Their Microscopic World Explored&quot; by Hilda Canter-Lund and her husband J. W. Lund.<br />Despite the cost, I recommend this book as essential for anyone trying to understand the North American freshwater algal flora.	2004-01-22

The difficulties I had with uncritical, unthinking acceptance of scripture led me to question the whole business.  Abject legalism, and in the case of some, totally wrong prophecy, slowly eroded my faith and I finally rejected all religion as narrow-minded bunk.<br />However, as I got older I felt that perhaps I was myself oversimplifying religion by assuming that the televangalists and ranting vision-seeing fanatics who caught the headlines were the spokespeople for Christianity, or even that Christianity was the only religion to consider.<br />This book thus comes as somewhat of a comfort.  You don't have to believe that the world was literally created in six days, that all of the books of the Bible are exactly true in a historical sense, or even that Jesus was the Son of God to at least share in the grand mystery of this universe.  As pointed out by Bawer, fundamentalism is not as old as they would like you to believe, nor are they &quot;fundamental&quot; to the faith.<br />I have to be honest here - I am basically an agnostic, but I do believe that there is a remarkable mystery behind life and its long evolution that science may never discover. You can call that mystery God, the Tao, nature, or whatever, but it does seem to defy analysis.  I am satisfied with that mystery and with the Bible as a worthwhile guide, but not as absolute word of God. The writings of men, however inspired, are always subject to corruption and change.  To me worship of the book is not a substitute for rational thought nor is legalism a good substitute for compassion.<br />Most religions have some form of the &quot;love your neighbor as yourself&quot; commandment.  Christianity is no exception.  In fact Jesus said on at least two occasions that if only two commandments were obeyed all else will follow- Love the lord and love your neighbor as yourself.  If the various &quot;Christian&quot; sects that struggle with each other and with other religions would actually put those concepts into practice this would be a much different world.<br />While I cannot share Bawer's exact beliefs, I do understand them. We all wish to make sense out of the universe and especially our lives.  My quarrel is not with faith, but with fanatic fundamentalism and the seekers of power and wealth in Christ's name.  I think that Bawer has certainly done us all a favor by exposing the hypocrisy and even hatred in these worshipers of doctrine over spirit.ourself.

This is an argument with a long history, but like nature-nurture it seems never to be settled in some peoples' minds.  While the nature-nurture argument has been demonstrated (to my mind at least) to be pretty much a non-argument (a few ultra-determinists not withstanding) the argument with microreductionism (which is to some extent related to the fight over nature-nurture) is still somewhat in flux. Reductionism in its best sense has been very productive, giving us drugs to fight diseases for example, and numerous other important insights about the structure and function of nature. However, Rothman has now demonstrated that some biological problems are non-reducible and thus reductionism is limited in its ability to explain.  This is not because of some mystical property of cells (everybody pretty much dismisses the idea of a mystical vital principle that animates living things), but simply because of the necessary structure associated with biological function.  In some ways the living cell has transcended the idea of a whole being a sum of its parts simply because of the complexity of cellular structure and function.  Thus if you pounded a granite rock to dust you could reconstruct the rock if you had enough pressure and heat, but once a cell is broken open  (as Rothman points out) its contents cannot be reconstructed in any way known to modern science.<br />Perhaps it is time for biologists to admit the truth that at least some physicists (notably Stephen Hawking) have come to- the universe is not totally explainable by a few basic principles.  It is, indeed, a complex structure that can only be partially understood by any method, including religious \\"truth.\\" The basic complexity of nature has always been suspected by most field biologists and we are not surprised to see microreductionism come into question.  Perhaps what we all need- biologist, chemist, mathematician, cleric, philosopher, or whatever- is a less arrogant attitude toward the wonderful universe in which we live.  This sense of wonder and humility is what lies at the heart of the best of all disciplines. I believe Haldane once said the if the human mind was simple enough for man to totally understand it, man would be too simple to understand it. This can be applied to the universe as a whole and life in particular. This is not an excuse to avoid trying to understand- only a warning that complete understanding may be made impossible by the nature of things.

After reading \\"The Empty Ocean\\" I was delighted to find this book, one that takes a broader look at a smaller area- Atlantic, as Cramer likes to characterize the great ocean.<br />Unfortunately both recent books give the same, often bleak, picture of what is happening to the oceans as humans over-fish the once huge fisheries and dump more garbage, human and animal waste, toxic chemicals and remains of machines into what is becoming a global \\"land fill.\\" We have also refused to take serious steps to reduce global warming at the same time evidence for our complicity in carbon dioxide increase in the atmosphere is mounting. Unfortunately for us Atlantic and the others oceans of the planet are starting to return the favor both in lower fish catches and altering ocean circulation that may well cost us way beyond the value of the fish we extracted.<br />Yet there is some glimmer of hope.  Humans may yet wake up, if a bit late, to the damage they are doing.  There are still nearly pristine beaches and walking alone along a beach with sea birds crying is still possible over much of the planet. I hope it always remains possible.

The life of Buddha is well described, as are the various schools of Buddhism from original Mahayana to Theravada and from Pure Land to Soto Zen, each with its own distinct practices. The author also includes discussions of related and/or contemporary religions- Taoism, Shinto, Confucianism- as well as the historical context. The book is very well illustrated and a pleasure to read. I gave a copy to the local Soto Zen Center and they were very pleased with it.<br /><br />Of all the world's major religions, Buddhism is nearly unique because it functions without a definition of \\"God\\" or \\"gods.\\"  To most Buddhists the question of the existence of God or gods is unanswerable and therefore not relevant to the practice (although gods- including Hindu deities- do show up in many Buddhist myths, they are not always meant to be literal). In recent years various polls have asked the question \\"Do you believe in God or a divine spirit\\" and the majority of Buddhists answer \\"yes\\", although a sizable minority say \\"no\\".  It would be interesting to discover exactly what is meant by \\"god\\" in each of the cultures involved, but a literal belief in god or gods (or goddesses) does not seem to be required to be a Buddhist.  For this reason Buddhism is often classified not as a religion, but as a philosophy. It has in recent years increased in the West to become a serious practice much beyond the Beat Generation and New Age practitioners. In addition, therapists, some businesses and even some Christian groups have taken up meditation as a useful technique. This book is a very good starting place for anyone wanting to understand what Buddhism is all about.	2003-12-08

Unfortunately Ellis has not exaggerated the problem, which will eventually cause all of us difficulties.  From the collapse of the North Atlantic fisheries to coral bleaching to the destruction of turtle populations, man has caused havoc in a supposedly inexhaustible habitat.<br />How did this happen?  Ellis points out that the reason that fisheries are collapsing worldwide is because of the super efficiency of modern fishing techniques.  In essence they can catch everything, or nearly everything, in the area fished.  Radar, huge nets, long many-hook lines and huge fleets of ships are used to feed the ever-increasing demand for seafood, sushi, aquarium fish, coral and rare shells.  Since the resource is often less than the demand, especially for high-ticket items like tuna, the profit is high and the \\"commons\\" are overexploited for current gain. Not only this, but the number of non-target organisms that die in the process is truly staggering.<br />What can we do to slow down the destruction?  We can try to back sound science-based fishing regulations and at least lower our demand for products from the sea, especially for those known to be overexploited. The tragedy is that, despite our efforts, the oceans of the world will probably never be quite the same again. However, if humans do not limit themselves they will soon (as Ellis notes on the last page) know for whom the bell tolls.<br />Read this book- it may make you think twice about current consumptive practices, especially if you value your children's future.	2003-12-05

Living protozoa do not necessarily look much like some of the drawings in manuals. The photos, while a bit on the small side (probably because of the cost of printing) are thus very helpful (and very beautiful).  Using Kudo's old standard &quot;Protozoology&quot; and Jahn, Bovee and Jahn's &quot;How to Know the Protozoa&quot; as a back up you can identify many of the organisms you examine and be fairly certain of the result.  I understand the high cost, as the market for this book is probably somewhat limited.  Freshwater microscopy is not like even butterfly watching in popularity, but there are a small number of devotees worldwide. Professionals are also somewhat fewer in number than in other specialties. This does not mean that protozoology is unimportant, only that it is less popular than some other areas of natural science.<br />Given this, the appearance of a book of this quality is remarkable.  Its utility is evident and I have now used it several times to help me identify protozoa in samples from sinkholes in New Mexico.  I recommend it without reservation.	2003-11-27

It is quite easy to sit in a comfortable office and decree that this organism or that organism be protected, without examining the consequences to the often-poor inhabitants of the land where the said organism lives. This is especially true when the organism is at least an occasional predator of Homo sapiens. In \\"Monster of God\\" David Quammen has examined the consequences of the conservation policy for both the target predators  and the humans inhabiting the same territory.  It is not a totally pretty story, with both animal and local human often on the short end of the stick.<br />Quammen does not romanticize the predators, but he does make us aware of their importance in the ecosystem as well as the difficulties of the local peoples who have to live with them.  Sometimes an accommodation can be worked out and sometimes it is on very shaky ground. It is always a complex interplay between predator and human.  Indeed, predators cannot be either over romanticized or demonized if we are to save and stabilize the populations of these magnificent, yet dangerous, animals.  Their loss would be regrettable, but their conservation must include adequate respect for the difficulties of people living with a dangerous predator nearby.<br />Yes, despite some nonsense written in the last century, crocodiles will eat people if given the chance. Lions, tigers and bears can and will also eat humans under the right circumstances.  The recent death of two grizzly bear activists by the claws of their \\"gentle\\" subjects should provide a cautionary tale.  These are not totally benign life forms- some sort of living stuffed toy- but neither are they evil.<br />Quammen's discussion of mythic monsters adds some historical background to the uneasy relationship between man and predator.  That humans have a history of fearing the beast beyond the fire  and of interpreting fossil skulls wrongly in this light is not surprising. However, Quammen does doubt the existence of a primordial ancestral fear gained from our precursors on the African veldt. Certainly one should avoid man-eating and ultimately frightening creatures.  But does that then give us leave to utterly destroy them?<br />Unless we are able to develop a compromise between the needs of people and the animals involved we may very well see the end of large predators. The complexities of this problem has been well stated by David Quammen.  He has written an eye-opening book that should be read by everybody interested in the conservation of these remarkable and frightening animals.re  and of interpreting fossil skulls wrongly in this light is not surprising.

He then introduces his view that evolution is shaped by the weird realities of the quantum universe.  Considering the complexity of life and especially the chemical reactions needed to sustain it and allow it to grow and reproduce, he has avoided to traps that many other writers in his genre have fallen into. By the time you finish the book you actually have some understanding of the problems involved, even if they have not all been solved.  Many authors who have written similar books leave you with the feeling that nothing has really been explained at all.<br />We do, indeed, live in a remarkable universe with rules that at least sometimes seem to defy common sense, but are in fact real.  The ultimate cause of life is still open to debate, although strict literal interpretation of ancient religious texts is probably not very useful in this regard.  However, whether one ascribes life's origin to a creator, to alien intervention or to chance (or something in between) it is almost indescribably wonderful.  This is what makes scientists study nature in the first place. Johnjoe McFadden has now produced a book that allows the reader to view the wonder of life through the best of science.	2003-10-28

Unfortunately the early and hard won triumphs of quinine have been somewhat short lived. Now malaria threatens us again throughout the warmer parts of the planet, but the quinine story is none the less riveting for that.  Quinine is no longer the preferred treatment for the disease, but it made exploration of the tropics by Europeans possible, as well as making parts of Europe and North America more habitable.  The difficulties and missteps involved in the development of quinine are echoed in just about every drug, food or other product that we now take for granted.  Such items as honey, sugar, antibiotics, nuclear power, crop varieties, domestic animals, plastics, computers, etc., each have their own stories and at least some of these need to be more emphasized to make us all less complacent.  The message is that knowledge is often hard won and needs to be respected.  It can also (as in nuclear power) be a double-edged sword.<br />While the author often rambles, I did not find this too much of a distraction.  Instead I was (as I say above) impressed by how human perseverance and even deviousness had managed to overcome huge obstacles to deliver the miracle drug quinine to the outside world. This part of the malaria story has been seldom told in a popular book until now and \\"The Fever Trail\\" is very noteworthy for this reason.<br />The later chapters cover discovery of the malarial parasite, the modern era of anti-malarial drugs, and the attempts to develop a vaccine, parts of the malaria story that several other authors have dealt with as well. The complexities of developing a vaccine are now more appreciated than they were when various researchers started working on the problem and made unsubstantiated and very rosy predictions which proved overblown.  Malaria still threatens us and the long battle with this \\"tropical\\" disease is far from over.  If nothing else, Mark Honigsbaum has reminded of this.nded of this.	2003-10-19

This is the book that helped me more than anything else when I was struggling with whether or not I could forgive my mother for her anger, self-absorption, and need to control.  At a time when clergy, therapists, and the lay community are urging forgiveness as an all-purpose cure for every troubled relationship, Safer counsels caution.  Not forgiving can be as moral and healing in some situations as forgiving can be in others, she says.<br />Safer is certainly not against genuine forgiveness, nor does she approve of vengefulness.  Her concern is that people are rushed into a dishonest façade of forgiveness when they do not truly feel it.  True forgiveness, she believes, takes time and is only partially under your conscious control.  She also believes that not forgiving, when an action genuinely offends your moral sense, and the perpetrator has shown no remorse nor made any effort to change, is a an honest and moral choice.<br />What is most important to Safer, and she illustrates it with many examples, is a serious attempt to engage with your feelings about the relationship in question and to admit the ways in which you may have contributed to it.  Only such honesty can lead to a healthy outcome, but what a healthy outcome is differs for each person and situation.  She also stresses that forgiveness and non-forgiveness are not opposites; they are points along a continuum, and there are many points in between.  Each individual must decide what is right for him or her, and any counselor who urges a particular and predetermined result does the client a disservice.<br />I recommend this book (which is clearly and interestingly written) to anyone who is struggling with forgiveness, or simply interested in it.<br />Lynda Goin (David B.

This fact alone made me pick up this book and then buy it.  I visited Guanajuato in 2002 and fell in love with the twisty roads, the Baroque facades of the Templos and the Basilica, the Easter-egg colored houses and the general feeling that one had been dropped down in a 18th Century Spanish town.  Rivera left it with his mother at the age of six, but the city of his birth, with its recent mummies and Day of the Dead festivals left its mark on him.<br />Rivera lived in Mexico City until 1907, when he left for Spain and for the next 15 years lived there and in France.  He picked up a common-law wife and then a lover- a portent of things to come.  He met and was friends (or sometimes enemies) with some of the greatest artists of the period, including Picasso, Mondrian, Modigliani and Matisse.  He worked in classic style until he accepted Cubism, only to move toward Cezanne-style art, and eventually to develop his own style. He eventually became one of the greatest of modern fresco painters.  However, his character was far from flawless. He lied about his past often and in different ways, depending on the situation, was not very careful about personal hygiene, and also often ran away from relationships to avoid unpleasant realities.<br />Rivera joined the Mexican Communist Party (MCP) in 1922. After three failures at having a permanent relationship with a woman, he married the rather obsessional young Communist Frida Kahlo (who was twenty years his junior) in 1929.  In that same year he was expelled from the MCP because of various internal party intrigues.  He then became friends with the exiled Leon Trotsky, who repaid him by having a short affair with Frida. Frida, to make matters more complicated, was repaying Rivera for his affair with her sister. Because of his association with Trotsky, Rivera was not readmitted to the party again until 1954, after the death of Stalin. This summery only touches on and can hardly do justice to the complicated world of Diego Rivera, one of the most complex of men.<br />Patrick Marnham presents in this book the convoluted ins and outs of Rivera's life, his many affairs and his association with the art world and the Communist Party in vivid detail.<br />This is a fascinating study of this very complex and often selfish man who was also a great artist. It is also a window into a very confusing and turbulent time in the history of the World.  It is a work that should be read by all interested in understanding this period and the modern world that rose from it.can hardly do justice to the complicated world of Diego Rivera, one of the most complex of men. <br />Patrick Marnham presents in this book the convoluted ins and outs of Rivera's life, his many affairs and his association with the art world and the Communist Party in vivid detail.<br />This is a fascinating study of this very complex and often selfish man who was also a great artist.

For one thing, it helps us see the men and women who laid down the foundation for our current understanding of the Mesozoic world in the light of their own time and place.  Mary Anning is seen as both the curious self-taught person she was and the commercial collector that she had to be to make a living.  Richard Owen, who later tarnished his reputation as the heavy in the struggle against Darwin's theories, is seen here as a brilliant young anatomist who was right more often than wrong.  The other actors in the drama, Mantell (who was a social reformer as well as scientist,) the quirky Buckland and aggressive Hawkins, as well as lesser players like De la Beche and Conybeare are shown with all the strengths and weaknesses of their very human nature.<br />Indeed, one impression that one immediately gets from McGowan's book is that it is not wise to dismiss the contributions of scientists who may turn out to be spectacularly wrong about something else.  Darwin himself misinterpreted the Glen Roy terraces and Agassiz (who was wrong about evolution) was in this case right in his glacial interpretation.  Lamark is known for the failure of his inheritance of acquired characteristics theory but is seldom given credit for his brilliant remake of invertebrate classification.  In truth, science probably progresses as much or more by the work of its &quot;lesser&quot; practitioners, as by a fictitious few geniuses who are always right. The sciences are plagued by all the human failings that other professions are and even the &quot;best&quot; scientist may be gloriously mistaken, while the &quot;worst&quot; may come up with an important breakthrough. McGowan has presented us here with a more balanced view of these seekers after knowledge and I think we may be the better for it.<br />Read &quot;The Dragon Seekers&quot; if you wish to understand how science often really works and the history of true dawn of vertebrate paleontology.ue dawn of vertebrate paleontology.	2003-09-16

Paley was the originator of the \\"watchmaker\\" analogy, which was a basis of the argument from design for the existence of a creator.  If you find a watch on the ground you do not believe that it arose by chance; its complexity proves the existence of a watchmaker.  Similarly the universe, in its complexity, beauty, and perfection, could only have been designed by a conscious and creative will-a Creator.  To Paley this of course meant God.<br />\\"Natural Theology\\" and a similar book on the evidences for Christianity (also written by Paley) were very popular in their day.  They were used as texts in many universities including Cambridge where Charles Darwin was a divinity student. He read them with much interest and was impressed by their tight arguments.  Until his voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle he was in fact a follower of Paley.  But his observations on the voyage, and the conclusions he found he had to draw from them, destroyed his faith in the argument from design, and after the publication of the Origin of Species, Paley's ideas fell in to disrepute.<br />When Darwin found that the evidence forced him to reject Paley's arguments, he was acting as a scientist.  Scientific ethics, indeed the whole idea behind science, demands that you follow the evidence rather than your personal beliefs and preferences.<br />The subjects of the book under review, proponents of Intelligent Design (ID), take a different view.  It is less important, they think, to follow the evidence, than to make sure that people believe the right things.  If the evidence does not fit their preferences, they discount the evidence. Their chosen weapon in this war (for they see it as a war,) is rhetoric-the art of persuasion by any means possible.  It is the method of the lawyer or politician, not the seeker of truth that all scientists (despite their very human flaws) are supposed to be.  It is a struggle, not for truth, but for power.<br />I find myself here, as a scientist, in an interesting position.  I cannot and do not wish to refute the whole idea of a creator.  For all I know there might have been one (I was not there when the universe was formed, but then neither were the ID people.)  In truth the belief in a creator does not have the rigor of a scientific theory, as it cannot be really tested at all (despite what the ID people say, evolution can be tested - at least indirectly.)  The existence of God or any other primordial creator simply cannot be proven or disproven. How would you test for existence of God?  What experiments could you devise for that purpose?  A concept that cannot be proven or disproven belongs not in the realm of science, but of faith, despite the current attempt to make it sound scientific.<br />This brings me to an irritating point.  ID people often claim that they are not arguing for the existence of the Christian God, but only of a creator.  This is to me a disingenuous statement.  Who is this creator that they have postulated but God?  If not God, are they arguing for an extraterrestrial intelligence?  I am inclined to conclude that in essence they are trying to interject theism into science, despite claims to the contrary.  It is true that not all scientists are fair in their treatment of religious belief - they would inject atheism into science, which should remain as free as possible from any preconceived notions. However, I tend agree with Gould that science and the humanities (including religion) are essentially separate magisteria and as such can sometimes interact, but one can never supercede the other.  If that happened, in my view both would be corrupted.<br />This book is a reasonably good history of the ID movement, told from the view of someone who is convinced that they are on the right track.  It should be read with this in mind.  However, advocacy is never a substitute for critical thinking.  Evolutionary theory has flaws and there is a ways to go before we understand either the universe or life on earth (if indeed we ever do!) but the principle that scientific debates should involve hard data must stand.<br />To get a more accurate and critical view of this debate I recommend the works of Robert Pennock.theory has flaws and there is a ways to go before we understand either the universe or life on earth (if indeed we ever do!) but the principle that scientific debates should involve hard data must stand.<br />To get a more accurate and critical view of this debate I recommend the works of Robert Pennock.	2003-08-30

As several reviewers (including at least one critic of Darwin) have said, this volume is part of the best biography of Darwin yet published.  It is hard to criticize this work as Janet Browne has included more detail and hit the nail on the head more times than in any other treatment of Darwin and his ideas.  I have read five biographies, several specialized biographies and Darwin's autobiography and can easily say that this by far the best! Browne is simply superb in capturing the spirit of Victorian England and weaving it into a cogent story of the background and inspiration for \\"The Origin of Species,\\" as well as Darwin's latter work.  This volume covers the period from the receipt of Wallace's manuscript on natural selection through Darwin's death.  It finally puts paid to the popular notion that Darwin stole his ideas from Wallace, without slighting the originality of the younger man.  Darwin was a great thinker, not because he was unusually brilliant, but because he concentrated his thinking on a problem until he came up with a plausible explanation backed up by numerous bits of circumstantial evidence.  While many changes have occurred in evolutionary thought because of the genetic and molecular revolutions, Darwin produced the most complete arguments for the common descent of organisms available to science at the time.  He thus laid the foundation of our understanding of modern biology.  This is true despite opinions to the contrary and, indeed, without evolutionary theory we would have to say goodbye to rigor in not only biology, but geology and astronomy as well!<br />It is my hope that anybody interested in the historical background of evolutionary theory will read both of Browne's books.  They are well worth it!	2003-08-13

At the very least we should have six kingdoms- Animalia, Fungi, Plantae, Protoctista, Archaebacteria and Eubacteria. The exact final number is yet to be decided. However, it can be easily argued that the Protoctista and the Bacteria could be broken into even more kingdoms and indeed several authors now talk of at least three domains, containing procaryote (bacterial) and eucaryote kingdoms.<br />All of this is primarily a result of studies on DNA and other chemicals of life. This research has especially shown the bacterial and &quot;single-celled&quot; organism world to be much more complex than anyone ever thought.  From slime molds to cyanobacteria and oak trees to humans, the variation on life on this planet is what fascinates biologists.  Tudge's book is a very good review of this extreme diversity and gives us a very good reason to avoid destroying it!  Read this book if you are interested in the diversity of life on Earth.	2003-07-21

Unfortunately this promise is never fulfilled!  The new species descriptions are inadequate, the taxonomic characters used are questionable and a complete analysis of the genera is never accomplished. Smith apparently never examined much of the various museum collections to do a major revision! There are also several glaring mistakes in the text that indicate that the author is totally unfamiliar with the literature.  We learn, for example, that only one species of tarantula (Aphonopelma voglei described by Smith in this work from Farmington) is found in the state of New Mexico.  However, a cursory examination of my reprint file produced several records for Aphonopelma from New Mexico.  These are not even mentioned by Smith.  In another section we are told that the Pecos River does not run through Texas (news to all those people living in Trans-Pecos Texas!), but only through New Mexico.<br /><br />Unfortunately, until the genera (especially Aphonopelma) can be properly revised we are stuck with Smith's Latin names for his very questionable species.  If it were not for this fact I would have to say that the book is not worth the effort to acquire at all!  At least it would not be on my list of useful books on tarantulas, but then the literature is so sparse that the list would be very short anyway.	2003-07-20

I have used it as a source for questions for the Entomological Society of America Linnaean Games for several years, while I served on one of the ESA branch Linnaean Games committees. It is simply great!<br />May Berenbaum has a very informal and humorous style that appeals to both the public and students. If, after reading her book, you still think insects are icky or uninteresting you are certainly made of stone. The number of little known facts in this book is simply huge. If you use just one book for reference on insects, Dr. Berenbaum's book would be a very good candidate. She treats everything from the invasion of the cotton boll weevil and the mysterious extinction of the Rocky Mountain locust to insects in movies and as human food.<br />If you do not like insects or are afraid of them, you really should read this book. It will go a long way toward desensitizing you and make you fascinated with insects instead.<br />I recommend this book highly to everybody from elementary school to retirement.	2003-07-19

She has written the best biography so far produced of a man who's life has been examined numerous times- Charles Darwin.  I have read at least four or five biographies of Darwin, plus his own autobiography, and can say that for engrossing detail, without loosing the main thread, Browne has topped them all!  This is the first volume in a two-volume series and I can't wait to dig into the second part, which deals with the Origin of Species and after.<br />The main strength of Browne's book, Charles Darwin: Voyaging, (and I expect the main strength of her second volume) is that she has a fantastic ability to weave details into the story without getting bogged down.  This is a well-written and very well researched book and I found myself amazed at some of the material she had found on Darwin's earlier life, especially as a medical student in Edinburgh.  The book is almost a social and scientific history of England starting with the late Georgian period. However, Browne makes the historic references very pertinent to her story.  Anybody reading this book and (I'm sure) the second volume, will come away with a much deeper understanding of and appreciation for the struggle that has gone into the development of our modern worldview.  Darwin certainly had his flaws, as do we all, but he was also certainly one of the most admirable of men, despite all his human failings.  Browne makes us understand why this man was great and how he reached this greatness by following his curiosity beyond the superficial.  She also gives us a more detailed understanding as to why Darwin found solace in natural history, instead of following his father, Robert, into the medical profession.<br />This is certainly just the best book to read to understand Darwin's early life before the publication of the Origin of Species.  I recommend it without any reservation.	2003-07-18

As a professional biologist (who is also an amateur fresh water microscopist) I appreciate such books, which are disappointedly rare. While now almost certainly dated, Vinyard's book remains the classic guide to these fascinating organisms.  Diatoms provide a major part of the oxygen that we breathe- a fact that is not generally appreciated- and so are very important to our life on this planet.<br />Vinyard has, in a very short book, admirably summarized the knowledge of North American diatoms to the date of publication (1979) and he uses bold text to highlight unfamiliar terms, which than can be looked up in the glossary. This is in my judgement a model for short handbooks.  I recommend it to all microscopists who are interested in aquatic microorganisms.	2003-07-12

It is centered on Darwin's study of barnacles and their contribution to his evolutionary thinking. In some ways the author sort of got there, but along the way she often got off the track and uses some strange analogies in the process. There were several typos that were disturbing. Perhaps the worst is that we are told on page 21 that the marine segmented worm Aphrodita aculeata has stinging hairs (it does not! - see Sue Hubbell's excellent book \\"Waiting for Aphrodite\\"), and that it is parasitic (it is a carnivore, as Hubbell also noted). In stating that Aphrodita has stinging hairs Rebecca Stott was repeating an error that has come down to us through a book published in 1558 by Rondelet! Also \\"aculeata\\" does not mean, \\"stinging\\", but spiny! One would think that by now this misinformation would not continue to be repeated. However, the main problem is that the author rambles a bit too much and covers a lot of ground not pertinent to the subject. In fact she covers a lot of the ground in regard to Darwin's personal problems that is better explored in several other recent books. This is not a fatal flaw, but the book would have been more original if the focus had been kept on the barnacles rather than on background material that nearly every biographer of Darwin has investigated. As for the book being \\"lavishly illustrated,\\" I am wondering what the writers of the dust jacket blurb meant! I would not have described it in that manner at all! Maybe \\"adequately illustrated\\" would have been better!<br />This book is worth reading and does give us some of the details left out of other books on Darwin, but the author has not answered the questions about Darwin's barnacles I would have liked to have had answered.	2003-07-05

An occasional science fiction or fantasy book, or more rarely historical fiction or mysteries are about as far as I go.  This looked like an interesting plot involving some biology and so I decided to read it.  It was well worth the effort!  Despite the depressing insight on arrogant and stupid human motivations, Margaret Atwood has produced a cautionary tale of the not too distant future where genetic engineering has reached its ultimate technical level. This is an age where our common pets are replaced with genetically altered or spliced rakunks and organs are farmed in pigoons (which later turn out to have picked up some human intelligence in the process!).  It is not difficult for a warped genius like Crake to utilize his skill and the desires of his fellow humans to spread a deadly virus that destroys nearly all of humanity.  His \\"friend\\" Jimmy- now called Snowman- who is immunized against the plague Crake has unleashed, and the \\"Crakers\\"- genetically altered humans who live at a basic level of their own- seem to be all that is left.  Crake and his \\"girlfriend\\" Oryx who we see originally as the subject of a kiddie porn site when she is eight years old, die apparently as a result of Crake's jealousy of the secret sexual relationship between Oryx and Jimmy.  The final ending (which I will not reveal) is a bit surprising, but believable and after 9/11, the anthrax attacks and our current state of semi-war, it is unfortunately not too difficult to imagine this tale of technology gone wrong as a possible, but preventable, future.<br />I recommend this book as a chilling reminder of man's inhumanity to man and where it might lead.	2003-06-30

I have been to many of the places in the late 1960s and early 1970s that Romano-Lax visited, and I can vouch for the accuracy of her descriptions.  I admire her courage (or possibly foolhardiness) in going on such an odyssey with her husband, two young children and a mentally questionable captain who also happened to be her brother-in-law. Oddly, I can identify with being with a mentally deranged person in Baja California.  I was also in that same fix in 1968 when I joined a zoology field trip to San Felipe, Baja California Norte, only to find that one of my companions was seriously depressed to the point of being suicidal (it later turned out that he was on drugs).  Travel to the Sea of Cortez seems to result in such strange associations.<br />I used to own an old copy of Steinbeck and Ricketts that I had been given for cleaning up a storage shed.  It was the only book in the shed and I was surprised to find it.  I fingered through Ed Ricketts' descriptions and photographs of porcelain crabs and murex shells.  I read the text and pondered Steinbeck's philosophical diatribes.  But most of all it made me want to go to Baja.  Within a few years of my discovery of the book I traveled to northern Baja three times and later made an extensive trip as far south as La Paz in Baja Sur.  Despite the problems, Baja left its mark on me and I never regretted any time that I spent there. My main grief is that I missed a trip to Cabo San Lucas in 1971 that I had an opportunity to take.<br />The mangroves, the beauties and problems of Bahia Concepci&oacute;n, Mulleg&eacute;, La Paz, Loreto, the Colorado River delta and Golfo de Santa Clara are well known to me and Romano-Lax has described each of these so well that I almost felt that I was back on the beach smelling the salt air and watching v-shaped formations of pelicans as they seemed to float almost effortlessly over the surging tide.<br />Ed Ricketts would have approved of this book.  Although he never liked to get his head wet, he was apparently most alive when wading in the surf and tidepools.  In some ways this book is more a tribute to him than to John Steinbeck, but in this case you really can't separate them.<br />If you are at all interested in the sea and/or Baja California, you need to read \\"Searching for Steinbeck's Sea of Cortez: A Makeshift Expedition along Baja's Desert Coast.\\" It is the next best thing to going there yourself!<br />.get his head wet, he was apparently most alive when wading in the surf and tidepools.

One of these factors is the tendency for organisms to form partnerships (symbiotic relationships that may benefit both).  Often this starts as parasitism, but may become (through natural selection perhaps) a mutual dependency.  Wakeford has eloquently summarized the growing evidence in this area.  Lichens are one notable example which were ignored by most 19th Century researchers.  Indeed, as Wakeford points out the Swiss botanist Simon Schwendener and the well-known children's book writer Beatrix Potter had shown that lichens are composite organisms, consisting of both fungus and alga. Both Schwendener and Potter were ridiculed by the scientific society of the day, but were later shown to be essentially correct in their views. Since then other scientists, including Lynn Margulis, have produced solid evidence that all multicellular organisms are essentially composite organisms, containing organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts that were once independent organisms in their own right.<br />Together with new developments in genomic research involving the switching on and switching off of genes these ideas will certainly alter our thinking about biology. Because of this I think we will soon have a totally revolutionary view of how life originated and evolved.  Not all of Darwin's ideas will survive and many if not most may be modified (as some already have been), but I think that Darwin, who was the ultimate in curious scientists, would have approved!<br />I recommend this book as a well-written very good introduction to the idea of symbiotic evolution.	2003-06-02

In it he attacks three obviously flawed ideas- the Blank Slate, the Ghost in the Machine and the Noble Savage.  I agree with him that a person's genetic makeup is highly important and that the extreme blank slate idea (that humans are born without a human nature and can be \\"written on\\" like a blank slate) is obviously wrong.  I have similarly little use for the Ghost in the Machine or Rousseau's Nobel Savage.  However, I cannot follow the equally extreme idea that only our genes matter (a concept that Pinker alternately defends and retreats from.)  As several people have pointed out in recent research the expression of a gene is primarily a dialog between genome and environment. Indeed, is there any reputable scientist today who believes in the absolute Blank Slate? John Locke (the originator of the idea) died in 1704 and the major 20th Century proponent of blank slate ideology, B. F. Skinner, had his own students eventually turn away from such ideas. In fact both may be getting a bit of a bum rap here because Locke also laid the groundwork for the development of our republic and Skinner was (although to a degree misguidedly I think) trying to make the study of behavior more scientific.  His work on operant behavior still has merit.<br /><br />In fact (as Ernst Mayr pointed out) the \\"Nature-Nurture\\" argument is to a large degree spurious because you cannot separate even unborn babies from their environment or conversely from their genes. It seems like Pinker is having an argument with Locke, Skinner and Rousseau. It is not surprising that he wins this argument, but it is somewhat like killing a dead horse! Unfortunately he takes the reverse (Nature) argument to the same sort of extreme. His argument that parents can have only negative effects on their children could only come from someone who has no children!  In addition he gives us more anecdotal stories and personal opinion than solid scientific data to back up his contentions.  His opinions on modern art and the law for example are suspect, since he has no expertise in these fields.  It would be like me, a biologist, presenting myself as an authority on automobile repair!  Obviously he will sell a lot of books because his views are in sync with the current political climate. This does not, however, make it science.<br /><br />In recent times I have seen several books from both Right and Left (and for all I know, middle) of the political spectrum that are purported to \\"tell it like it is, or should be.\\" These include ideas that we can improve on nature's \\"mistake\\" by genetically engineering carnivores to eat grass, that the universe is really simple and its origin can be broken down into a few lines of computer code (Douglas Adams beat them on that one), and that humans lived contemporaneously with not only dinosaurs, but even Permian reptiles. Many of these books are thick (how one writes such diatribes is beyond me) and full more of the author's ego than of any solid empirical evidence.

This is a really well done exposition of a broad range of organisms called \\"fresh water algae\\" and their enemies, as well as the alga-fungus community known as a lichen.<br />The excellent photography of Hilda Canter-Lund and the expert writing of her husband, the algologist J.

It is hard to find any major fault with this book because it is essentially unique.

In \\"Tower of Babel: The Evidence Against the New Creationism,\\" he has demonstrated this ability. Inded this is one of the best summeries that I have read on the subject. As Pennock implies,<br />the gap between science and religion grows wider when certain self-styled experts insist on finding evidence for their pre-conceived notions. Pennock reports accurately that the creationist view (including the re-clothed \\"intelligent design\\" form) is only a part of a vast Judeo-Christian base (even discounting other faiths- Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, etc. in the debate) and it is ultimately dependent on a literal interpretation of scripture. It is thus not necessarily the \\"bedrock\\" Christian belief that its proponents would like us to think.  Many ardent Christians of the past (among them St. Augustine) were also supporters of whatever scientific truth emerged.  Some even warned of making Biblical inerrancy a church dogma.  The results of such dogmatic views (as well as the political climate of the times) led to Galileo's persecution and the embarrassment of the church of that period when it became obvious that he had been correct in his support of Copernicus.<br /><br />It is unfortunate when one extreme part of a religious faith becomes so vocal that it seems to dominate and speak for the whole community. The literal interpretation of Holy Texts can easily slip into bibliolatry, or worship of the book (a form of idolatry.)  We recently saw the most unfortunate results of such radical theocracy in revolutionary Iran and in the terrorist actions on September 11, 2001 (both based on Islamic fundamentalism), but they also include the very \\"Christian\\" Inquisition and the Salem Witch Trials of the past. Pennock has done us all a great favor in exposing the tendency of a few to try to take over and speak for the many.<br /><br />This is a well-reasoned and excellent book with only a few errors that I could discover.

This book portrays the true Charles Darwin as a grieving and loving father and husband, a very human and humane doubter in revealed religion, and a serious and thoughtful scientist.  That people can have honest differences with a popular view of religion without having horns and a pointed tail may open the minds of some.  It will, unfortunately, probably not convince those who refuse to entertain the possibility that non-believers can be moral beings.<br />Keynes has done us a great service by revealing the private sorrows and triumphs of his famous ancestor and their effects of his thinking. Unlike many other great men (like Isaac Newton, for example), Charles Darwin seems to be someone you might have wanted to have as a neighbor and friend.<br />I recommend this book without reservation to those who would like to know more about the man who revolutionize our thinking regarding man's place in nature.	2003-05-04

It is an excellent presentation of the history of evolutionary thought that is easily read and understood by almost anyone. I realize that many creationist will be put off and spend some time pointing out supposed \\"flaws\\" in the book and evolutionary theory generally. However, despite their difficulties and the lamentable inability of many Americans to take evolution and the concepts of deep time seriously, the idea has triumphed within the science of biology (and in much of the non-American world.) No amount of attempted suppression or \\"equal time\\" demands will change that and such attempts only make the proponents of \\"intelligent design\\" look foolish. It is possible that they will win out politically for a while, but so did Lysenko in the former Soviet Union until his ideas about \\"vernalization,\\" among others, were later shown to be totally false. There was a huge cost to agriculture in the USSR because of Lysenko's ideas and we would face a similar cost in molecular biology, medicine, geology and similar fields if the creationists should \\"win,\\" based on the weak \\"evidence\\" they currently present.<br />If the \\"intelligent design\\" proponents want to discount biochemical, geological, anatomical, and even astronomical evidence, or discredit evolution by bringing up already discarded ideas and hoaxes (like Piltdown Man) as straw men, they are free to do so, but such perversity does not validate their argument.<br />This is not to say that evolutionary theory is static or should be free from criticism- far from it! New ideas within the evolutionary framework are being proposed all the time. Gould and Eldredge some years ago brought up the punctuated equilibrium idea, expanding it somewhat on similar ideas of Mayr. More recently Margulis has proposed a symbiotic evolutionary mechanism. There is an ongoing argument over evolutionary psychology (well reviewed by Zimmer in this book!) and more and more discoveries in the areas of molecular biology, behavior, paleontology, geology, ecology and systematics are constantly altering and changing the landscape of evolutionary theory.<br />This is in fact what distinguishes science from pseudo-science like \\"creationism\\" or \\"intelligent design.\\" It is, despite individual scientist's egos and definite human flaws, a self-correcting system. If true empirical evidence for \\"intelligent design\\" should appear, eventually the scientific community would (perhaps after some time) accept it. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for creationists, even in their new guise as practitioners of \\"intelligent design\\" theory. Science cannot deal with the supernatural explanations of the creationists, which are based on faith, because science has to be dedicated to the material world in order to function. Zimmer demonstrates these problems pretty graphically and I applaud for this magnificent effort!<br />I recommend this book highly to anyone with an open mind.and more discoveries in the areas of molecular biology, behavior, paleontology, geology, ecology and systematics are constantly altering and changing the landscape of evolutionary theory.<br />This is in fact what distinguishes science from pseudo-science like \\"creationism\\" or \\"intelligent design.\\" It is, despite individual scientist's egos and definite human flaws, a self-correcting system.
