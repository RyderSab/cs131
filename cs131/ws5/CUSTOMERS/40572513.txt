While most people aren't going to be familiar with the name, Bettlehiem was an expert on folklore and mythology who tried to pass himself off as a reputable psychologist.  He ruined the lives of millions of people by stating unequivocally, with nothing but a hunch and his collection of fairy-tails to back him up, that autism (a neurobiological condition present in-utero) was actually the result of bad mothering. <br /> <br />It was then that I realized that maybe fairy tails, such as the fairy-tale of Iron John, can tell us something... but we shouldn't assume that just because something is old that it's Timeless Wisdom.  This is especially true as the fairy tales and myths explored in this book are all the products of patriarchal cultures.  Ultimately, although this book is \\"food for thought,\\" I wouldn't consider it a complete meal. <br />	2005-05-27

It's not \\"Our Journey\\" at all. It's the commentary of a number of parents as to the journey of their children.  The journey through High Functional Autism and Asperger's Syndrome is something that the individual makes alone.  To suggest otherwise is to say that someone else can live your life for you.  While being mis-titled is bad enough, it actually borders on offensiveness when one stops to ponder that these children's neurologies, whether you think of them as gifts or as afflictions, are not actually theirs but rather their parents. <br /> <br />Title aside, the reason why I ask you not to read this book is because it discusses quite frankly and candidly an 11-year-old's fear/fascination with the erotic image of Lola Bunny, from \\"Space Jam.\\"  While this may be amusing and perhaps even somehow enlightening, this frank candor into childhood sexual fantasy is going to haunt this person for the rest of their lives.  When this person is 30, there will still be a book, with his photograph as an 11 year old, sharply dressed in a suit and tie right over a few choice paragraphs as to his reaction to his erotic dreams of Lola Bunny.  While perhaps this information is vital to allowing neurotypicals a much-needed \\"roadmap\\" for \\"their journey,\\" the idea of protecting the anonymity of this child, who will soon be a teenager and than an adult, is given absolutely no consideration.  That autistic people often share information that seems to invite teasing is an unavoidable part of the autistic experience.  That this person's parents, and that the editorial staff at Jessica Kingsly Publishers would then decide to print a book to inform the world of this person's embarrassing adolescent sexual fantasies, is horrid. <br /> <br />Out of respect for this person, please don't read this book. <br />	2005-03-14
US	40572513	R3JC748YUJWL71	0140863222	575466033	The Regulators	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Audiobook Review	This audiobook kept my keen interest, but not just for the usual reasons.  One of my major interests is autism, and I was hoping against hope that Richard Bachman could write a convincing autistic character without lapsing into myths of autism, or worse... using autism as a metaphor. <br /> <br />For the majority of the book, Bachman does an excellent job with Seth, especially in creating a believable (at least in the context of the genre) tension between Seth and the intertwined, parasitic intelligence of Tak, whose reality-warping powers are shaped by Seth's perseverations.  Speaking of these perseverations, Bachman is able to create two parallel stories... a cartoon series called \\"MotoKops 2200\\" and a 1958 western called \\"The Regulators,\\" both of which Bachman created out of whole cloth, but with enough verisimilitude to feel like independent creations. <br /> <br />The only time Richard Bachman errs in his narration of the autistic Seth is very near the end.  He makes the mistake of saying that within his inner world, Seth is not autistic.  Autism is far more than a neurological condition; it is a configuration.  There is no more a \\"normal\\" child within an autistic person than there is cat within them.  The other mistake Bachman makes, and within the same paragraph, is to use the term \\"genius\\" as an antonym for \\"autistic.\\"  Autism is not a form of mental retardation.  While there are some mentally retarded autistics, there are also autistic geniuses, such as Temple Grandin, Carl Sagan, Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.  Still, this is forgivable in light of Richard Bachman's knowledge of autism being limited to only that available in the 1980's. <br /> <br />What really struck me most about this book though is Bachman's absolutely sick sense of humor and misanthropic characterizations.  I was howling with laughter.  No description I could type could explain how truly funny this book is. <br /> <br />One note for the audiobook version only... Frank Muller breaks the \\"fourth wall\\" with a note to the editor.  The editor did not edit this note out, for whatever reason.  While this doesn't change my rating of the book, it does effect the overall flow of Muller's otherwise brilliant narration. <br />	2005-02-15

The first flaw was that autism-from-the-autistic-perspective came almost entirely from one source, \\"Nobody Nowhere\\" by Donna Williams.  The problem with using a single autistic autobiography as a source is that it is all too easy to take an autistic feature and make that \\"the key to autism,\\" or worse... take a feature unrelated to autism and assume it to be autism.  Durig does this with his use of \\"Willy\\" and \\"Carol\\" as part of the autistic construction of self.  However, I didn't deduct a star for that.    The second major flaw is in the failure to address that autistic perception is meaningful.  Durig uses the phrases \\"meaningful perception\\" and \\"Autistic perception\\" in such a way that also not intended as opposites, they can be construed as such.  Durig doesn't use the term \\"meaningful Autistic perception\\" until fairly late in the first chapter.    The third major flaw is using Bruno Bettlehiem as a primary source for how autistics construct their self-concept.  The problem is that Bruno Betttlehiem, while once seen as *the* expert on autism, was exposed as a rank fraud long before this book's publication.	2004-09-14

If you're an autistic person and you've just been diagnosed, it's hard to know where to begin.  Comparing yourself to a list of often contradictory traits (included with this book), with no context as to how they work together, is frustrating and confusing.<br /><br />Norm Ledgin does a wonderful job at explaining what autism is through taken a single example and showing how autism effected the course of his life.  In doing so, he makes it easier for the autistic reader to see in what ways they are like Jefferson.  This follows Norm Ledgin's own process, as it was his son's own striking similarity to Thomas Jefferson that lead to this book's creation.<br /><br />As Norm Ledgin paints a picture of Jefferson through his life, it gives a sense of \\"place\\" to the autistic individual's own life.  Although Jefferson's life ended on a low-point, it does show that one's autism isn't always a disability.  Jefferson's skill as a writer, for example, came from his lack of speaking skill.  Jefferson's sense of the fundamental equality of individuals comes from his own sense of uniqueness, and his inability to process hierarchy, so common among autistics.  Norm Ledgin succeeds threefold with his book.  Not only does he draw a convincing case for Jefferson's autism (something no other historian had done), he also has written an excellent primer on understanding autism, as well as a book which instills a sense of pride in the autistic reader.	2004-08-10

However, I would not let him go, despite the fight he made to break away, and eventually he fell asleep utterly exhausted and I felt triumphant. Here I was cuddling my child, although asleep, and I had held him in my arms for the longest time since his hospital tests. It was exciting and a challenge... I had brief visions of taking my 'cured' little boy by the hand into the local primary school! I survived on those dreams!<BR>...<BR>He [Grant's other brother] decided that he would demonstrate how he felt 'holding' might not help his brother. He picked me up and flattened me on the floor, sitting on top of me and pinning my arms to either side of my head! 'Struggle!' he commanded. I tried, but no way could I be released from his grip. 'Now,' he said, 'what do you feel like?'<BR>'Trapped and frustrated,' I breathlessly replied.<BR>'Quite,' he said, and released me!<BR>Despite this I felt we should go ahead. Surely the idea was to make the child angry and frustrated so you break down their barriers, thus producing eye contact and speech... Most of the time Grant would look in any direction but our eyes and go deep into himself, refusing to let out any angers or frustrations. He had a resigned air of patience with a 'you can try all you like but I can stay shut off from what you are doing until you are fed up' attitude. I think it let out oodles of our own emotions if nothing else. If you spent nearly two hours to get this kind of reaction, you finished up feeling frustrated and downhearted at your lack of achievement. On the other hand, there were good sessions that might have been shorter, but much more satisfactory and made you feel that it was all worthwhile.&quot;	2004-06-10

The chapters are very short, even the long ones.  Also, almost every other chapter is a tangent to what's happening, \\"downtime,\\" as it were.  The pacing is very close to the way autistic people pace themselves.  It prevents the reader from being overstimulated by the action taking place, yet is also interesting enough on its own to prevent the reader from being understimulated.  I would recommend this book to both autists and neurotypicals alike.	2004-01-17

However, this book is formatted in the style made popular by the \\"For Dummies\\" series.  Combined with the dimensions of the book, this makes it much easier to follow.  This version also has more details on syntopic reading.    This book isn't really about reading, or speed-reading.  PhotoReading is vastly different, as it involves seeing the words with the peripheral vision and understanding their meaning on a preconscious level.  Many have argued this makes \\"PhotoFocus\\" a useless activity which Paul Scheele uses to sell traditional speed-reading activities as previewing and skimming.  However, events such as lucid dreaming, spontaneous activation, and increased intuitive capabilities prove that there is something going on at an other-than-conscious level.	2003-07-30

Originally, the book was a guide to using Direct Learning, outlined in chapter 11.  Because Direct Learning involves relying on implicit memory, rather than conscious recollection, the four-step process of Release-Notice-Respond-Witness is a way to manifest the skills downloaded by Direct Learning.  The biggest problem with this book, and the only problem I have found with it, is the pure amount of ideas and information the book throws at the reader in its 200 pages.  It mentions the basics of just about everything out there that might aid in any part of the Natural Brilliance process.  It's up to the reader to integrate as much, or as little, of this information as they can.<br />The Natural Brilliance audio course does offer assistance to the overwhelmed, but it doesn't cover the core behind Natural Brilliance: Direct Learning.	2003-04-30

In all fairness, this series takes a dramatically anti-Christian stance (slowly at first, and climatically near the end, as if the tension of the plot and the vileness of faith are exposed in parallel).  Christians do well to avoid it, unless they're willing to be offended.<br />However, this series has the potential to show through fiction what hundreds of angry essays have failed to communicate - that the war we fight is not \\"good against evil,\\" or \\"order against chaos,\\" but rather knowledge against ignorance.  However, this moral isn't dropped heavy-handed.  Rather, the books characters, plotline, and subtly alien worldview (a culture almost exactly like our own, only without any real division between magic, science and theology) engross the reader without regard to the reader's metaphysical stance.	2003-04-15

The conclusion of all arguments is that even if the Gospels are an accurate description of what happened (as opposed to how or why it happened), Jesus Christ may just be some guy with groovy supernatural powers.  Perhaps he is a Vampire, a space alien, or even a demon from Hell sent to subvert the truth of Judaism.    It's an excellent guide book for when and if the reader would want to argue with Christians on matters of their faith.  You can start with the more sweeping arguments, such as the existence of a historical Jesus, and then grant them to your opponent as you move into finer details, such as the virgin birth and resurrection as not being proofs that Jesus was the son of God in and of themselves.  I give the book five stars because it helped me through a very difficult time in my life, when my mother was forcing me to read apologetics.

I had spent the entirety of my existence under the fishbowl of advertising.  Although I had seen styles come and go, I really didn't understand enough to truly fathom what Ewen was saying.      This, I think is Ewens's primary weakness.  He comes off as attacking something that most people don't really see as existing.  Fashion and style are too easily made straw men.  Especially important is that fashion and style are usually under some sort of attack, either for using sex to interest people, for promoting an unrealistic standard of beauty, or even as the ultimate cause of violence and poverty when people murder others for their shoes or their coats.    It is far too easy to mistake Ewen's attack on style as an attack on having aesthetic values at all.  His use of fascist and proto-fascist sources as examples of the evil of style also weakens his work, as it looks like he is trying to create a \\"slippery slope\\" argument between Vogue and Mien Kampf.    Ultimately, I would say the book is worth reading, but only if one is looking for a way to better express what one already feels.  If you are looking for something that will change minds, this is not the book.	2001-12-19

When I first got the book, the dryness of the language really turned me off.  It felt a bit ponderous.  Additionally, the author's unasked for review of Kultov's \\"the Book of Lilith\\" seemed to be building up of one's self through the tearing down of another.  Upon taking a leadership position within the Temple of Lylyth, I felt I had better review some more history.  I had paid for the book, so I figured I may as well read it.  I actually got into it, and even quoted a few pages to the Temple's mailing list.  The second part is the book's saving grace, as it talks about the psychological aspect of Lilith in modern Jewish people as manifested through dreams.  They are quite symbolic, and give a deep, if confusing, look into the minds of other people.<br />I would recommend this book for the serious student of Lilith over and above any other, due to the fact that it clearly contextualizes Lilith both as a historical and modern phenomenon within the culture that created her.  This book is also not feminist, and the images of Lilith that come from out of the minds of men may have more meaning and impact on a male reader than a feminist pro-Lilith description.	2001-12-19

Most of the one-star reviews are due to this book being a recipe for hopelessness, and that is an accurate picture of this book.  What I find most interesting is the Biblical metaphors.  The main character, Adam, greatly parallels the Adam of Genesis, including the curse of Adam that he would have to be a Farmer.  His girlfriend, Amy, is like Eve in being created for Adam.  And the antagonists in this book have an eerily hidden quality.  I use the plural \\"antagonists\\" due to both the sides of the struggle Adam finds himself in being essentially antagonistic, and deeply intermixed.<br />How much you'll enjoy this book depends on how much you like David Lynch movies, Memento, and [neo-noir] genre in general.	2001-12-04

I became interested in Satanism through the Satanic Bible, and at the time I read it, this book impressed me.  However, the reason I give it two stars is that half the book is common sense that everyone should know already.  The other half is just (...) made-up languages and silly theatrics disguised as powerful rituals.<br />There is so much healthy and vital about Satanism, and while this book may be a good primer for it, it should NEVER be treated as a \\"Bible,\\" only as an introduction, and one opinion out of many.	2001-11-08
