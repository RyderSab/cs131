Page turner doesn't describe how enthralled you become in the lives of the Jacksons.  I always wondered why Janet and Michael rathered distanced themselves from the rest of the clan, now I  know. However to state from what I read in this book that the family is dysfunctional would be a compliment, because from some of the accounts they are insane.  The questioned was answered as to why Jermaine all of a sudden became jealous of Michael and his fame. <br /> <br />Also I discovered the reason the Jacksons are so broke is that Berry Gordy owns all the rights to their music which means they have no income except for what Michael and Janet provide.	2005-02-14

Well purchasing Mr. Graham's book turned me around to the point that I see my vision for the future and what it has to offer me.  I started by purchasing a day planner and already positive results have come into my life along with some positive thinking people.  There are still many areas in my life that need to grow and improve, but we have to start somewhere.  I would like to thank Mr. Graham for giving me the blueprint to success.	2004-08-20

In life I have learned that there are people who you will meet that are not worthy of you knowing on any level.  It's nothing personal, but there are just some people who you will meet in life that are just full of it and have no aspirations, goals and/or plans in life.  Sista Souljah does speak the truth on many issues such as racism, sexism, being intelligent and at the same time being overlooked in the black community, poverty and education.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to question our status as Africans living in America.	2004-04-05

At this exact moment I feel the same way Mr. McCall felt while working in mainstream America and about how blacks cannot be aggressive in the workplace.  Another thing I can relate to is how blacks have to be perfect and whites are allowed to make all of the mistakes in the world.  What really inspired me bout this story was how it took prison to turn around Mr. McCall and his life.  I am glad that I read this book it gave me a lot of perspective in my life and where I should be focusing my energies.	2004-03-15

The author gives way too much scenery detail which can take away from the characters, and the last 140 pages seemed to drag out.  However, the story was original and the characters were so dynamic especially the colonel with chasing his own version of the American dream.  Truthfully with some of the other people I spoke to about this book that no one was really right or wrong and there were times you felt for Kathy, Lester, the colonel, Nadi and Esmail.  Even though they all had drawn their lines in the sand you could understand each one of their points.	2004-02-17

Woodson said back in the 1930's are still going on and are true today.  For example, blacks who invest so much faith in the wrong community/political leaders, blacks religious leaders who drive their big expensive cars and give the wrong message to our people and how blacks will not buy from other blacks because they don't want to see him/her get ahead in their own community.  Also knowing how blacks have problems taking orders from other blacks in supervisory position.<br />The thing that most influenced me in this book is that we as black people need to take an aggressive approach to changing and leading our community.  We as black americans need to stop looking to white people for our solutions, because we already have the solutions to many of our problems.  And last of all we should stop hating one another and start appreciating the great ideals in our community.  What makes this book so great is that it shines the spotlight on what is wrong in the black community, but also on ways of how to fix the things that are wrong in the community concerning education, poverty, job creation, business creation and self sufficiency.	2004-01-06

Well I discovered the fears that I had with performing math and that a lot of people have those same fears.  When told how confront my fears it was like a serious wall had came tumbling down.  I have started studying college algebra again which was so difficult for me fifteen years ago and it seems that this subject is no longer taboo.  Before with math I always thought that I need a teacher/professor to teach me the subject. However I have discovered that is not true and that self learning college algebra  is better for me.

The protagonist Easy Rawlins a fired aircraft worker and WWII veteran gets pulled into a world of deceit by a person he perceives to be a good friend.  Easy is hired to look for a woman by the name of Daphne Monet, but everyone he comes in contact with that could possible help him is murdered.  Finally Easy starts putting the pieces of the puzzle together with his long time friend Mouse and in the end everything makes sense. The books tangles a serious web of deception which is rather interesting.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.	2003-07-30

The book starts out with his mother and father married and living togethter in the south, but Richard's father abandons the family which lead to a life of extreme poverty.  Richard's mother tries as best as she possibly can to just provide food for her two sons, but many days Richard and his brother go without eating.  As the years go on Richard gets use to not eating even when he is starved and is offered food and money by white northerns who come to the south.  <br />Richard faces oppression in his family by his aunt and uncle who want to beat him, because they believe his is basically an evil boy because he doesn't want to become saved in the 7th day adventist church.  Richard had to pull a knife on his aunt and razor blade on his uncle in order to avoid their beatings, which was unheard of in that period of time.  Richard doesn't really feel apart of the family and chooses to find reading as an escape from their oppressive life while tending to his sick mother.  Richard finds racial discrimination when he is introduced to the job-market working for white people in the south.  Richard is threatened by two white co-workers to the point at an optical shop in Jackson, Mississippi he quits for fear of his life.  Then Richards moves to Memphis where he faces more racial discrimination and is determined to leave the south for a better life up north in Chicago. <br />In Chicago Richard joins the communist party and sees how race is not a factor and that he is not judge upon what the communist people see, but rather his being an intellectual.  Richard realizes that the communist party is an oppressive organization, because it does not promote individuality or personal thought, but rather everyone is a group that none of its policies should ever be challenge and that no one should ever turn their back to them.	2003-07-21

People always assume that black men are social deviants, but it was interesting to see that black women can also be just as callus.  Mizz Pickett, Willenda and Lizzie were the most horrible human beings that were trusted to take care of children who actually abused them.  Mizz Pickett reminded me of Albert so much from the \\"Color Purple\\" that it was beyond scarey.  Mizz Pickett was phyisically, emotionally and mentally abusive to all of the people in her home and did not mind robbing people of their spirit and dignity.  However, Antwone was a fighter and used day dreaming to escape to another world and he always knew that one day he would leave the Picketts home, but not the way it would happen.  <br />I have not see the movie, but instead read the book to get the true essence of what Antwone Fisher experience in his life.  I realize the movie is going to be different from the book, but that doesn't matter to me.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would love to read it again and pass it on to others.  I have learned so much from Antwone and his life.	2003-06-23

However, there were a few points in this book which you knew were going to happen such as her meeting a new man and coming to a cross road.  Next you knew as a reader that her abusive husband would finally track her and I thought it would have come sooner than later in the book.  But in all this was a pretty good book very well written and I would recommend it to someone going through an abusive relationship.	2003-06-02

I never knew that Ms. Walker has Lyme disease and that she loved to garden. The casting of certain individuals in certain roles shocked me it never dawned on that Tina Turner was their first choice in playing Shug Avery and that Lola Folana and Diana Ross were also considered for the part. Also I did not know that Ms. Walker had a problem completing the screenplay for the actual movie due her disease. Ms. Walker is one of the best authors of our time and it is a shame that people cannot see the beauty in her work.<br />I do remember all of the controversy surrounding \\"The Color Purple\\" when I was a teenager and how I was forbidden to see the movie. When I finally saw the movie after it had been out on video cassette three years later I was shocked and enlightened all at the same moment. I was shocked at seeing two women kiss and enlightened to see Celie break away from her abusive husband and flourish as person. The book and the movie are different and people should read the book before passing judgement on Ms. Walker's character if they have only seen the movie. I know now Ms. Walker had somewhat of a different vision of her book being made into a movie than Steven.	2003-03-31

Pitts basically stated how once his father died of cancer he was basically forgotten about, but never forgiven for the things he had done to make their lives so complicated for his family.  <br />Pitts speaks to other men in a focus group setting about their relationships with their children and the mother of their children.  Some of the relationships seemed as if the father really did not know what to say or do with the children and some of the children felt who is the mystery man?  My heart went out to so many of the men, women and children who never got acquainted or tried and failed.  I believe that so many men make children and probably fallout with the mother of their children.  So many men see the \\"baby mama\\" as an obstacle who makes them feel inadequate or uncomfortable.<br />I had a friend who fathered a child with a woman and had not seen the child in the tweleve years that the child has been on earth except for the day he was born.  My friend received a letter one day from his son wanting to see him and my friend wanted to go out and buy everything in the mall for his son.  I explained to my friend that money can't buy love and I said that the most valuable gift you can give to your son is history.  I explained to my friend that he should tell his son where he came from, his family, and take the boy on a trip to see where his father grew up.  The boy is curious to know about his father, but also about himself and so often we lose sight of that by purchasing expensive that could never fill the void of family history.	2003-03-17

I always thought geishas were prostitutes, but I was so wrong.  I discovered geishas were much more dedicated to the arts and that they have to actually attend school in order to become a geisha.  <br />However, the story of Chiyo (Sayuri) and her sister Satsu, being sold from their fishing village in order to become geishas.  I never thought of Sayuri as a prostitute, but rather as a slave pretty similiar to plesage realationships in New Orleans.  Yes Sayuri did not have to cook and clean once she became a geisha, but she had to surpress her feelings for the man whom she truly loved and could not really express her feelings.  I hated and cared for the character Hatsumomo who was basically jealous of Sayuri and made Sayuri's life at the Okyia pure hell. What really bothered me was the rivalary that was placed between Sayuri and Pumpkin which cost both of these young girls a very valuable frienship. This book had so many twists and turns in it that I became engrossed and learned so much about geisha.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about geishas, but I also know that the author of this book has been sued by the geisha in which gave him this particular memoirs. So the geisha that sued Arthur Golden has decided to tell her side of the story which I will read in the next couple of months.  I would like to discover what a real geisha has to say as opposed to an American giving us a second hand story of something he may never fully understand.	2003-03-11

There were some similarities between both books, but there were some differences also.  I had heard some of the rumors and speculation about the King family trying to milk Dr. King's legacy in the monetary sense.  However, Dexter does a good job of clearing things up about how much time and money is spent protecting his father's legacy due to the fact that some individuals and corporations believe and/or assume that Dr. Kings' speeches and papers are public property and can use them for monetary profit.  I agree whole heartly with the King family in protecting their father's legacy including all of his speeches and writings.  The thing that stood out the most to me pertaining to this issue was that we as blacks in America discount great black thinkers, intellectuals and people who take a stance in the black community.  We have a belief that our black intellects work such Dr King, Malcolm X and Medgar Evers is not as valuable as compared to that of their white counter parts such as Nixon, Kennedy or Bush.  <br />Dexter King also gives us some insight into how he grew up near housing projects in Vine City, attended a exclusive private school then public high school, and life at Morehouse. I had no ideal that Dexter's mother currently lives in Vine City, because gossips have always said she was living in a huge mansion in Buckhead. Next Dexter talks about his love life, but never gives any names but calls one serious girlfriend \\"Mon Ami.\\"  I would recommend this book to anyone trying to find out more about the King family.	2003-02-17

Dr. Ross researched the area of family and the importance of having a strong family base along with religon were highly significant to the findings of her study of why black males succeeded.  Also Dr. Ross was able to perform a qualitative and quantitive analysis study to measure the results of her research to support her theory.  I found this particular research interesting, because also these black males that were selected for the study were also mentored by a faculty member, administrative or staff member of the university.  I would recommend this particular research to anyone who is looking to send their son or daughter to a historically black college or university.  So often we debate in the African-American community should we or shouldn't we send our children to HBCUs or non-HBCUs and this particular book will be able good tool to help us make a researched base descision.<br />I am interested in performing the research that Dr. Ross has currently performed and hopefully one day I will get that opportunity.	2003-01-14

However, if you want something bad enough and you work hard for that particular goal it will be obtainable with prayer.  Dr. Carson's book is something remarkable and the things that I noticed that set him apart from all of the rest was reading for knowledge and personal enjoyment.  Reading opens up a world of knowledge that cannot be obtained just through life and its experiences.  Reading can shape your future into something so bright and wonderful because books contain so much knowledge.  <br />The spiritual side of what Dr. Carson talks about is very important so that we keep ourselves grounded.  And last of all possessing good ethics professionally and personally, because the same people you meet on your way up are the same individuals you will encounter on your way back down. <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is lost and looking for a way out of a world of ignorance.	2002-12-26

There are some people I see in the workplace who utilize deceit as a tool for success and those same individuals usually get what they have coming to them in the end.  So the lesson Ms. Shriver had about ethics is one of the most important lessons about achieving success, because without ethics people will not respect you.

I have seen this happen to so many young people and once their demise has been casted upon them people have treated these deceitful people as if they had the plague.  <br />There are a ton of young people that I see entering the job market who lack professional ethics and I would definitely recommend this particular book to them.	2002-12-16

I read this entire book in two settings and there were times that I laughed like someone was tickling me. Cedric goes into his life in St. Louis, college, LA, first job and many other experiences he had while growing up and achieving his goals. I like the way Cedric explains about how he cannot call a grown man \\"delicious\\" or how he does not have all night to make love. At first I thought this book would be a not very well thought out or just plain boring.

Russell Simmons uses so much profanity and I know that he believes that he is being real by doing so much cursing.  However, at the same time the usage of so much profanity shows a lack of creativity in the usage of the English language.  <br />However, in the middle of book the until the end of it Mr. Simmons gave us some valuable information about how the big parent record companies really don't want to see companies like Def Jam, Uptown, and other companies that specialize in producing hip hop artists to succeed.  In the same aspect Russell Simmons sheds some light on Andre Harrell firing Puff Daddy from Uptown records and how the big executives at MCA did not like Puffy or Biggie Smalls levels of success which was too great for the executives over at MCA to handle.  The book is a must read for all people aspiring to enter the  music game period and how recording artists are really at the bottom of the food chain when it comes to points, royalties (money) and most of all respect.  <br />This book was really good, but Russell kept jumping back and forth in time which confused me a great deal.  Nevertheless just because this book was poorly written does not take away that Russell Simmons is a genius and great role model for a lot of us to look up to for guidance.  This book has given me a higher level of respect for Mr. Simmons and the hip hop world, which I was already a big fan of many artists like LL Cool J, De la Soul, NAS, Jay-Z, Tupac, Biggie, Queen Latifah, Mc Lyte, Jungle Brothers, Tribe Called Quest and I could go on for hours listing artists that just move me whenever I hear them.	2002-11-18

However, I did enjoy the book thoroughly, because it dealt with some reality that other books do not address.  The reality I am speaking of in which I can relate to is the main character Bobby Dallas whom is struggling with the development of his career and finances.  So many authors create this perfect utopia where nobody has problems with money or their career, and their biggest problem is finding that perfect \\"soulmate\\". <br />I was interested in how Pearl Davis would finally get what was coming to her for dumping Bobby the way she did and not really giving him a second thought.  However, the author did not go into that which I wanted to know more than anything.	2002-11-04

However, I could not have been so wrong with characters like Ingrid, Marvel,Claire, Ameila, Starr, Rena, Ray and I could go on and on with each of these dynamic individuals and lets not forget Astrid. I savored this book like a fine wine reading and studying each word that was written by Ms. Fitch. <br />Astrid to me was a girl that was protected by her mother's world and when her mother had to go to prison that world went away. Astrid went from foster home to foster home, but at each one of these foster homes Astrid was taught some lesson about life at Starr's she learned about god, Amelia taught her how to suffer, Marvel showed her predjudice, jealousy and family, Claire's lesson was that life was very fragile and Rena's lesson was you have to be tough in life. However, Astrid's mother Ingrid always told her \\"keep your bags packed\\", which meant don't get too accumstomed to your current living situation, because that could change in no time at all.

Instead I chose to suffer in silence and internalize everything which I knew then was mistake just as I know now. However, I applaude Sam, Rameck and George for just being together and supporting each other during the good and bad times. These three brothers have shown us all that you can make it even when the odds are stacked against you. I related more to George, because I was a guy that never got into trouble listened to what my parents said and just did the right thing. However, I had those friends who got into trouble during those adolescent years and now I wish that I could turn back time and extend a hand to them. I eventually graduated from college and graduate school and this book has inspired me to apply to graduate school to pursue my doctoral studies. All three of these doctors are my heros and role models which I look to for strength and guidance through their past struggles. All I want to say is that I am extremly proud of all three (Sam,Rameck and George) and that they are truly blessed by god and so many angels. <br />A book like \\"The Pact\\" is a great and inspiring story that should be shared and the message I got from the book which is an old cliche. Am I my brothers keeper? and the answer is yes I am and he is mine. Also the book lets us know that anything worth having is worth working for and that we are all worthy of great blessings.	2002-10-07

Morrie Schwartz was an outstanding individual whom had a great zeal for life and taught people around him how to really appreciate what is important in life which did not include money, fame or success.  However, Morrie showed his prize student Mitch that stopping to smell the roses, love, family and community were really the important things that mattered and God's true blessing. This book really moved me and I would recommend it to anyone who feels so overwhemled in their daily lives, because this book will give you the perspective of what is really important in life.	2002-09-16

I had read several reviews of this book here on Amazon.com and noticed how several readers who were white males were outraged by this book.  However, instead of those readers addressing key issues in this book dealing with the historical and systematical legecies of racism they chose to attack the author Dr. Tatum on a personal level.  Dr. Tatum more than likely wrote this book to bring attention to the psychological cause and effect of racism in America and is trying to find a remedy early in life for our children so that they do not become as misinformed as Archie Bunker.  Also the other reviewers kept referring to black and white racisim when clearly Dr. Tatum discusses Asians, Native Americans, Latinos & Hispanics.  So I have to ask those reviewers who were so hostile, did you read the book all the way through with full comprehension? <br />Next I would like to address the issue of Affirmative Action which as Dr. Tatum stated is not a quota system.  Affirmative Action benefits all Americans and the group which has benefited those most from affirmative action is white women(check with the U.S. Dept of Labor).  Now systematically minorities(blacks, latinos,asians,native americans and women) were locked out of opportunities with affirmative action in order to be considered for a job you need the minimum qualifications in ordered to be hired and most of the time people think minorities have the least qualifications which is not true.  Because minorities also graduate from accredited colleges and universities, perform volunteer work, active within their communities, gained valued experience and training very much similiar and sometimes greater than our white counterparts.  <br />I recently spoke with a caucasian admissions counselor at a medical school which I knew very well.  This admission counselor explained to me that without affirmative action if all of the medical schools in America were to take the best students then none of them would be white Americans. If the medical schools were to accept only the best then the best are Asians & Middle Easterns.  Now I have to ask the enraged white males how do you explain those circumstances to me and everyonelse here in America and please don't attack me, attack the problem.	2002-09-03

The movie I saw about two years ago and cannot really remember it too well, but after reading the book I am going to rent it this weekend.  The way Jefferson was potrayed as a hog instead of a human being and a man made it easier for the jury to find him guilty and sentence him to die.  The rationale being is that it is okay to slaughter a hog, but to kill a man well that's another subject so instead of addressing Jefferson as a man lets make him into a hog.  There were parts of this book that made me feel anger and other parts that gave me hope and promise.  However, at the end Jefferson showed even though he was innocent of killing Grope he would take being at the wrong place at the wrong time as a man.	2002-08-02

At first when Dr. Dyson started talking about OJ Simpson I started saying to myself \\"oh no, not again.\\" However, that touchy subject was not too bad and I did not get as angry as in past conversations, books or reports. There were comparisons and constrasts between Farrahkan and Colin Powell pertaining to the million man march that seemed very insightful. Such as Colin Powell thought the million man march was a good conceptual ideal, but due to the fact that Farrahkan was the march's organizer he boycotted the million man march. This book actually makes you think about things in life and it is not one of those books that you just read and then put down and don't think about anymore. Race Rules has me now reading \\"I may not get there with you\\" and I am already so into that book. Dr Dyson keep up the good work.	2002-07-15
US	44039142	R3A7EQERC20BK5	0345444957	605284938	Growing Up X	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Wow	Ms. Shabazz, has written a wonderful and insightful book into her personal life as the daughter Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz. When I thought of Malcolm Xs' daughters it never came to my mind that they were so normal and everyday type of people. In my mind and in the mind of many others thought that these ladies would be very radical and militant. Yes the daughters of Dr. Shabazz had their advantages in life, but they had their disadvantages also. Ilyasah, spoke about how their mother protected them from so many things such as racism, people's conceptual ideals of their late father, but she also kept \\"daddy\\" alive in their memory as a person. There were so many postive things that Dr. Shabazz did for her daughters especially in the area of their education, because as a parent she wanted the best she could possibly provide for her children. All I have to say is that is book had me find a higher level of respect for Dr. Betty Shabazz whom basically did it all for daughters after the death of her husband.	2002-07-08

Mr. Hannibal Johnson did a wonderful job in potraying the devesatation brought upon the African-American community on May 31, 1921.  This particular book should be in every African-American home as a must read to show our youth that in the past were have been a prosperous people.	2002-06-25

It is just the little things that you do and don't the separate the macks from the everyday square brothers. After I read the book I started contemplating on past relationships and saw where things started going wrong. Then I went back to see about when I met a women for the first time and the things that I said that put me into the categories that were listed in the book (Square/Professional). The author does men a huge favor by breaking things down on how to protect yourself from some of the female predators that exist in our society. Well all I have to say is Tariq keep up the good work, because I defintely appreciate it and everything you have written is true.	2002-06-03

Mammy,had to be a very smart with the ability of wearing many hats, because her position held so much power on the plantation which \\"American History\\" does not give her credit for having.  Cynara, was rather complicated, because she had always felt inferior to Other who was her half sister.  I know I will have to read this book again to pickup things I did not get the first time, but I did enjoy the book a great deal.	2002-05-30
US	44039142	R32XECGFSIQ66G	0671727796	730655858	The Color Purple	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A great novel	Alice Walker did a wonderful job in writing this novel and the only thing that I am upset with is that it took me so long to pick up this wonderful book.  Celie, is a dynamic character who has the most generous and forgiving heart, but I found Shug to be Celie's guardian angel from Albert's rage and violence.  The relationships between the characters were so dynamic and evolved in a manner that confused me, but kept me reading for more.  If you have only watched the movie then you have not truly received the core meaning of the \\"Color Purple\\".  All I have to say is read the book and judge the characters and their lives for yourself.	2002-04-23

However, there was one thing that was too outrageous and that was the author's nose job experience. I believe that people who receive nose jobs or whatever type of plastic surgery are looking for some type of self-esteem that can be purchased and race is not always a factor. People want to look their best and are willing to fork over the money to do it, but one thing you have to remember is that we are not getting any younger and who really cares that you have a big nose, full lips and big ears.	2002-04-09

I have met some people before in my life where grew up in Jack and Jill and some of the other organizations the author mentions in his book.  I did not realize that when those people who were being introduced to me were actually sizing me up to see if I was worthy of associating with them and their circle of friends.  I was astonished to realized some of their accomplishments, but most of them were extremely pleasant, courteous and open to a certain degree.  However, I did face the confrontation of why I did not attend an HBCU for my undergraduate and graduate studies which rather made me wonder why I did not choose an HBCU.  I will say that these group of African-Americans are very much in tune with who they are and where they are going in life.	2002-03-29
US	44039142	R3G3JEGCQTSOD1	0029353653	991751855	Beyond Blame	Books	5	20	25	N	N	The honest truth	At first when I read this book I thought I would differ with the author due to our different political beliefs. However, I could not have been so wrong, Mr. Williams just explains that so many of todays youth want the easy way out and get rich quick by any means necessary. I agree with Armstrong that you have to understand the value of hard work in order to succeed legitimately in America, and just because we grew up poor and black is no excuse. The liberals of this country really hurt our community more than helping us by saying we as black turn to crime, because there are no alternatives. I grew up in a small city in Illinois, but I saw so many opportunities for myself to succeed and it did not come from wearing Tommy, Polo, DKNY or other top designer clothing. My success came from my knowledge through education, because education creates options not a life of fast living sell drugs.	2002-03-27

This book has so many lessons pertaining to living in the fast lane and how you think you are playing someone or something and you end up getting played.  Winter was a brilliant girl, but at the same time she was extremly naive when her emotions got involved.  The sheltered life her father had given to her during his reign in Brooklyn had her believing she was almost royalty.  There were times I became disgusted with Winter and other times where so much smpathy I expressed for her.  All I have to say to Sister Souljah is keep up the excellent work.	2002-03-18

I enjoyed the Bap Handbook thoroughly, I purchased it Thursday started reading it Friday night and completed Saturday morning. The only time I put this book down was to laugh, because I knew women in all four categories (Betty, Boho, Butterfly, and Bogus). This book is well written and flows with a certain level of curiousity that keeps the reader glued to the book. Ladies you have done a wonderful job and anyone who cannot find humor in this book I feel sorry for which means they are probably in the \\"Bogus\\" category.	2001-09-24

There are things in this book that show how the democratic party has taken advantage of the African-American vote, and how Bill Clinton really was not concerned with the African-American community. The book also explains how people may think reparations are an entitlement program such as welfare, but that is not the case. What I got from this book by Randall Robinson is that we need a stronger political agenda in the country in order to get the things we \\"need\\". One approach is to start electing politicians who are willing to put forth the issues of reparations for slavery, and if that politician in your area does not want to support our agenda \\"get them out of office\\".	2001-09-17
