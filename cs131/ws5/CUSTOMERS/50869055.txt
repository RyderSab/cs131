But that doesn't diminish the excellence of this whole-life biography by Robert Farrell. He does take a different tack. It is not quite as personal or intimate as McCollough. I might even venture that it is a bit more scholarly. David McCollough write for the masses & is the best writer/historian we have.<br /><br />  Farrell digresses, sometimes at length. He discusses animal husbandry & crop rotation during Truman's farm years, the economic & banking system during Harry's haberdashery years & the blizzard of agencies & crooked cronies that populated them during his second term as president.<br /><br />  I must confess I did read McCollough's but listened to the unabridged audio version of Farrell's book, which admittedly is easier. Still, I found McCollough's marginally more entertaining. Obviously both men liked & respected Truman. Farrell might be a little more critical. Two faults stood out to me. Truman was thin-skinned & touchy on some subjects. His bitter relationship with Eisenhower was a a good example. They both acted very immaturely for men of such stature. Farrell did not tell the story of Truman's threat to punch a reviewer in the nose for a bad review of his daughter's recital, except in passing. He had a habit of writing scathing letters to someone who displeased him, even his wife. Then he would not mail it. Some of these letters survived in his papers. He didn't have much use for Churchill until much later when both men were out of office. The other shortcomming could have been a virtue & that is loyalty which he carried to ridiculous extremes. He developed a blind spot for anyone that was ever a friend, a member of his army unit, (he was the captain), a mason (he was a past master), or was affiliated with the Pendergast machine. They all got a lifetime pass. This came back to bite him in several minor scandals & charges of cronyism in his second term. None of these dust-ups touched him, with one exception. While in the Senate he had his wife Bess on the payroll, until it was discovered. They needed the extra income. He was extremely bright & a quick study, an honest politician, with integrity & character. He revered & honored the office of the President. He separated the office from the person who happened to occupy it. Mr. Farrell brings this all up very well. He has written other books on aspects of Truman's life as well as \\"The Dying President, FDR\\" which I will check out. This work is not a second rate biography merely a close second place.he had his wife Bess on the payroll, until it was discovered. They needed the extra income.

He wrote the truth & was called a liar. As for the book, it's easy & about a sixth grade reading level. It is obvious he didn't have a ghost, so he is to be commended on that.    The story of his life. Beyond that it is also a weapon to be used against Major League Baseball. He is bitter, about many things, among them being denied the chance to get 500 homers.     He may not be a liar now, but he did cheat by using steroids.  That everyone did it is a childish excuse. He claims he could have never been a major leaguer with the body nature gave him. He tries to explain away his violent, sometimes criminal temper & aggression. Was that behavior the result of steroids?     The highlight of course was his visits to a bathroom stall with  Mark McGuire, Raphael Palmerio, Miguel Tejada & others to shoot-up. He helped them do it & advised them. Despite that, I like him & his book. He has a certain style & is entertaining. But squealing on your teammates to sell books & settle old scores is dishonorable. However, this is baseball, nothing more. Congress  should stay out of it. They've less integrity than MLB. They have other things to do that are more important.       Will I buy his next book? Absolutely.	2005-08-11

Hollywood's moral values were not those of the rest of the country even in the 1920's & 30's. Anywhere else Clark Gable is a cheating swine. Nobody knew this at the time because big brother MGM protected it's own from unpleasantness leaking out to his adoring public. His acting ability & magnetism allowed him to have any women anytime he wanted, if you believe the author Jane Ellen Wayne.  She blows hot, cold & lukewarm on her subject. I guess that passes for objectivity.  Gable was a whinner, over-sexed & never satisfied. His first two marriages to older mentors were shams. They served their purpose & were discarded. He cheated on them both regularly.     His rise to stardom was slow & tedious, like the first two tapes of this audio version. But then it picked up. He was committed at first to the live stage. But, like many other  legitimate actors, he was seduced by the $$$ to be made in  Hollywood. His timing was excellent. Many silent era stars could not make the transition to talkies. His voice was very masculine & very sexy. He cleaned up his act with a new set of teeth & physique. He life was owned by MGM. He never had the backbone to defy Louis B. Mayer. He hated him & griped constantly, but did what he was told. MGM in turn, made him their biggest star, & his fans could not get enough of him. He was dubbed the King of Hollywood & never relinquished that title. He was a working actor & made many very good movies such as \\"It Happened One Night\\", \\"Saratoga\\", five with Jean Harlow, & of course \\"Gone With the Wind\\".      The turning point in Gable's life was his marriage to THE love of his life, Carole Lombard. She died a hero's death as she returned to California from a bond drive early in the war. She was flying back rather than taking the train & her plane crashed in the mountains near Las Vegas. She had decided to fly because either she missed Clark  very much (they were in love with each other) or she suspected him of cheating on her. Lana Turner, Joan Crawford, or ??? Take your pick. He was fooling around on the only women he ever really loved. He never recovered from her death or the guilt he felt. This  made him a more serious, introspective & maybe better actor. He saw action in the Army Air Corps in World War II but was pulled out of the line of fire when it became more of a hassle keeping Hollywood's greatest star from harm than it was worth. A remake of the 1932 movie \\"Red Dust' was renamed \\"Magambo' with Ava Gardner & a young Grace Kelly was  probably his most ballyhooed post war movie. Others such as \\"Run Silent Run Deep\\" were also pretty decent.    A lifetime of abusing his body plus a lot of booze & cigarettes were    taking their toll. The great male actors were dying in the 50's. Bogart, Cooper, Flynn, all gone. Gable died shortly after making \\"The Misfits\\" with Marilyn Monroe, also her last movie. His only child was born to his fifth wife, Kay Speckles, shortly after his death.	2005-06-02

It is a good jumping off point for this prequel to David Nevin's  novel, 1812. It is written four years later but his style is unmistakable. It is 608 pages long. Since it is told like a story, I felt the unabridged audio version was the best way to go. <br />   The presidential camapaign of 1800 may have been the vilest & mean-sprited in our history. It also effected a major change in our constitution. No longer would the runner-up in the presidential race become vice president as had previously been the case. It just became be too politically dificult for the president to have his major opponent sitting as president of the Senate. It was the final step into full blown political parties & conventions that we now have. Interestingly, there is no mention of political parties or conventions in our constitution as a way to nominate a presidential canidate.  <br />   There are two major plots in this novel that are connected. The first is an expedition clear accross the continent to the Pacific. First mentioned in 1795 by Thomas Jefferson to his neighbor back home in Virginia. This became the Lewis & Clark Expedition of 1804-06. That neighbor  was Merriweather Lewis, a Major, U.S. Army. It was a trip to the moon by today's standards. The other plot line was a the fate of New Orleans. Spanish? French?American? It was nominally owned by Spain who could not hold it much longer & everyone knew that. Much depended on  the war in Europe. There was currently a truce as Naploloen pondered an invasion of England. There was a slave revolt in the French Colony of Haiti. France sent 25,000 troops. It was also a conveniant jumping off point to invade New Orleans. The United States also needed New Orleans for it controlled the Mississippi River, gateway to the vast interior of the continent, owned, at this time by France. America could not have resisted the French alone. They would need the British Navy. The British were eager to helpthe Americans. That would have reduced America to a vassel state beholden to England & hastened the sucession of New England (& New York) from the rest of the union. It never came to that of course. As it turned out Napoloen lost his entire 25,000 man army in Haiti to the heat, disease & fierce native resistance. They never returned. He rethought his plan to send another 25,000 men to New Orleans. As all this was going on Major Lewis was obsessing over the expedition. He finally got the go ahead from President Jefferson. It was at first a secret. The expedition would be tresspaasing through French territory. Lewis felt it would be a long shot that the French would kmow about it much less find him.  <br />  Through-out this history lesson is the drama of the personal lives of Lewis, Jefferson, James & Dolly Madison, Vice President Aaron Burr, John Ouincy Adams etc. & many fictious characters to advance the plots. What is happening in New Orleans or Paris or Washinton D.C.?  The tension between France & The United States at this time is well exploited by Mr. Nevin. <br />Spain has given New Orleans legally to the the French. Finally Napoleon sells not only New Orleans but the entire Lousisiana <br />Territory. He wisely recognizes that he cannot fight in America as well as Europe. It is also a stick in the eye of England who had expansionist plans in the west. This purchase instantly doubles the land mass of the United States. This book, or tape, if your prefer, is an excellent entertainment & historical value & highly recommended.	2005-05-26
US	50869055	R38Z4Q3PN1ID5P	0786117648	681575843	The American Leadership Tradition	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Get past the fact that Marvin Olasky is a conservative,	religous zealot with an agenda. This is still pretty entertaining writing. I love revisionist history. Just don't    swallow  Mr. Olasky whole. His lack of footnoes or attribution didn't really occur to me. I listened to the unabridged audio cassette version.    Mr. Olasky seems to suffer from terminal self righteousness & condemns those who have a problem with the seventh commandment: when it suits him. He also has a problem with leaders who don't genaflect to \\"God\\" every time they open their mouths. After the first 1,000 times I heard, \\"God Bless the United States\\", I felt like saying \\"enough already\\". Apparently slavery, genocide of a people  (Jackson) & unbridled greed (Rockefeller) are qualities we should admire as long as God is invoked at regular intervals. Washington & Lincoln are good despite the fact that Washington was a slave owner & really did like to dance with the ladies. That's okay. Both men are national icons. He rips Thomas Jefferson a new one. T.J.also had slaves, but what bothered Mr.Olasky most was he slept with woman. He was single, (widowed actually) unlike Washington. However, Jefferson did not invoke God constantly & probably was an atheist. Grover Cleveland a good man & president, fathered a child out of wedlock. He stays in Olasky good graces by his generously mentioning the almighty in his speeches.     If you can master it, compartmentalization is a very useful skill for leaders who have a weakness for sex. FDR was a moral relativist. JFK is shoveling in the fires  of eternal damnation, despite his bad back. Clinton may join him some day if you believe in a physical hell, that it sounds like Mr. Olasky believes in. Where time & money are wasted on moral issues is  that Congress dances when ever the media whistles. The impeachment of Bill Clinton was proof of that. More recently the baseball steroids scandal wasted time & money. Terry Schiavo was not allowed to die in  dignity. But it is a Republican Congress & President. They probably have nothing better to do.	2005-04-08

Joseph Loves Jenny etc.    This historical soap opera starts with a lots of tumescence then settles down to tell a true story.    The events are true, most of the characters are real. Most of the dialogue, the conversation are decidely not. No matter, as they serve to advance the history going on around them & the history that they are making.     There are several important venues: Washington D.C., Where President & Dolly Madison preside in the White House, Canada, northern New York & the Lake Champlain area where key naval battles are fought & the south particularly New Orleans, where General Andrew Jackson is making his name. The unabridged tape is long as is the book, but I was not bored. It is told like a novel rather than straight history.      This story is the coming out of America, more united than ever. The reasons for the war, trade & the impressment of American sailors was quickly resolved by the very act of war. However, the conclusion reached by many history books is that this was a useless war. In fact, it may not be much more than a footnote in the history of the British Empire. Bigger things were happening in Europe that overwhelmed the War of 1812 in interest.     The nation was expanding rapidly & several states had been admitted to the union west of the Appalachins. The ballance of power in the United States was moving west. Ironically the larger the country grew in size the more united, we became with a real sense of identity. The arrogance of the British in buring down the capitol for no  military gain united Americans like no other single act could have.     The  British could not have won. They were trying to defeat a continential nation. For what? Wellington, one of the greatest military leaders of all time knew this & said so. The British people were fed up with the taxes used to finance an unwinnable war.     For the United States, The War of 1812 proved the Revoltionary War now 30 years old. Jackson defeated British regulars soundly at New Orleans. The war was already over but they didn't know that. It still was important to note that the United States would have to be reckoned with in the future. Highly recommended.	2005-03-03

FDR & Hitler were as different as two leaders could be. They did have one thing in common & that was their management style. <br />Basically it was: Chaos. All those able men below them were never sure where they stood. Who had the bosses ear? Who did he talk to last? Is he mad at me today? They'd play one advisor against another & it worked. Nobody knew everything except FDR & Hitler & it mostly was in their head. But by November, 1944 FDR was dying & Hitler was a physical & mental wreck. Stalin,Churchill, Ike & later, Truman were up to the task. <br />  This book spent a lot of time on Henry Morgenthau, Treasury Secretary. He was FDR next door neighbor at Hyde Park & his best friend. He abused this special relationship, which allowed him to interfere in post-war plans for Germany. He had no special qualifications but he was a Jew. His plans for all Germans was harsh indeed. His proposal was a complete destruction of  German industry. A pastoral Germany pre-Industrial Revolution, pre-unification & pre-Bismark. Germans were to subsist on what they could produce. Germany had not fed itself in the 20th century & this would have led to starvation. One of Morganthau's favorite lines was: \\"Three bowls of soup every day for every German.\\"  Now FDR hated the Germans & he humored Moganthau. But FDR's idea was to leave intact Germany's industrial capacity, which at the end of the war was still considerable, & turn it over to Great Britian for their use. At this point Great Britain was bankrupt.  Churchill knew, with his keen foresight, that a strong Germany would be an important ally in the coming \\"Cold War\\" with the Soviets. <br />    Harry Truman was inexcusably kept in the dark on all post war planning. Then FDR died. But Harry was a quick study & rapidly grew into the presidency & was soon up to speed. As Morgenthau & all the old cronies of the previous 12 years discovered, Truman was no FDR. <br />	2005-02-22

I have not read Cabel's bio from 1918 on Franklin but this one by Carl van Doren might be the best. I tend to discount autobiographies as they tend to be highly partisan & even revisionist. The version Franklin's autobiography I read, & there seems to be dozens of them, was  fairly modest.  <br />   This is a whole life biography & is taken in large part from Franklin's own writings, letters to from & about Franklin. The unabridged audio version was a real treat & the amount of research must have been staggering, considering it was written in the thirties.  <br />   This is a very through book. Where it treads lightly, whole books have been written. That is Franklin's lovers & the numerous children from these liasons, mostly in France.  Mr. Van Doren is skeptical, keeping in mind when this book was written. Franklin loved woman & woman loved him but not nessarily in that way. He had many friends & \\"daughters\\" refering to his many, young female admirers. He keeps the wise grandfatherly image I had of him. In fact he was a neglectful husband & an absentee father to his own daughter deserting his wife during all those years overseas.  <br />   There is so much to him, a true citizen of the world. He was a self-made wealthy merchant, inventor, scientist, philospher & statesman. The title he was most proud was master printer, an individual who started from nothing. He had many roles in life & van Doren covers them all. <br />   His most important years were spent in England & France. He loved London & Paris. He may have been tempted but he was always loyal to America, keeping her interest in mind. He was the face of America in Europe. He played the part expected of him;  a rustic American philospher with a fur hat & was all the rage in  the royal court of France. <br />   The colonies were fortunate to have Franklin in England before the revolution & France during & after. That is where with, Franklin's connivance, the major decisions concerning America were being made. <br />   His accomplishments ranged over various disiplines, as the inventor of the lightening rod, the Franklin stove used for heating, bifocals  etc. He founded the first public library & fire department in America.  He was the major contributor to the Albany Plan of Union in 1754. A document way ahead of its time, was a useful reference during the constitutional convention in 1789. He assisted Thomas Jefferson with key phrases in the Declaration of Independence. He was important in reaching consensus when the U.S. Consititution was being drafted. <br />   Had he stayed in Philadelphia, he may simply have remained a popular, loyal, prosperous printer & businessmen. He saw first hand the disdain King George III had for him & the colonies. To him America was merely a source of taxes without the rights accorded to all free Englishmen. This & the humiliation he suffered at the hands of British Parliment, turned him into a uncompromising (for one of the few times in his life) rebel. With his patience, gentle diplomacy, wisdom & sense of fairness, America was well served. With apologies to Washington who never left North America & Jefferson, Franklin may be the greatest founding father. <br />   While writing this review it occured to me that there are many similarities to Winston Churchill. Franklin was not a warrior as Churchill was but both men were visionaries & peace makers. Both were geniuses & prolific writers on any number of subjects. They were both statesmen & active in public service to a very old age. Both men dominated the times they lived in.  <br />   Read or listen to this fine book, then move on to other newer biographies. They all add somthing to this remarkable man.  <br />	2005-01-26

He looked, played & acted as the movie star he was. Women loved him. Men would have loved to be him. He was more often seduced than the seducer which was part of his charm. He never forgot who he was & where he came from: Archie Leech from Bristol, England. He was amiable & apolitical yet had a streak of independence & courage that led him to be one of the first stars to break with the studio system. That allowed him to be a free agent & pick the movies he wanted to do. It didn't always work out. Sometimes, the movies stank & he was the best thing in them. But most of his movies were money makers & that was really the only thing that counted. He was admired for his independence. He could be difficult to work with but was not tempermental. He was a professional working to perfect his craft as he liked to put it. This obsession with perfection did not work with the women he loved & he left four failed marriages in his wake. This failing apparently never occurred to him. <br />  He didn't have to be pushed into old man roles & retired on his own terms. A class act.	2004-10-21

It is not reasonable to assume that a small island 3,000 miles away could hold indefinitely, as a colony, a continent filling up with the best & the brightest of their own race. Ben Franklin felt that America would become fully independent, but long after his death, sometime in the 19th century & hopefully peaceably.     By 1765, the colonies already had a 100 year tradition of self-government. When England became embroiled in it's own civil war in the 1640's the population of Europeans in America was 5,000. A decade later it was 40,000. The neglect of England created strong, democratic,  capitalistic roots, stronger than those in Great Britian. When Britain \\"rediscovered\\" it's colony it found a relatively properous population of loyal British subjects. They were seized on as source of    revenue for the crown & the seemingly constant wars Britain was involved in. This was fair as Britian spent considerable money defending the colonies from native Americans as well as the French & Spanish. It is when these taxes became onerous or an impediment to commerce (\\"intolerable\\") the time frame for independence became much shorter.   Don Cook navigated through a vast amount of reference material to put this book together. This is not a textbook but I would recommend it to high school & college students studying American history. It is very readable as it takes the reader through the blunders, mistakes & miscalculations of the British Parliament, military establishment & most important the crown of George III. It was he, above all men who could have prevented the war. He was too proud, stubborn & unable to compromise.    Ben Franklin is the main character. He had spent most of his adult life before 1775, as an American, living in London. In fact he preferred it to home. His frustrations, humiliations & relationship with the government, turned him from a loyal subject to a rebel. By that time, back in America, John Adams, Sam Adams, George Washington etc. had also made the same decision. A decision that shook all of Europe & France, in particular, in a few short years.	2004-10-15

You will enoy this book if you're interested in Europe's political history just before the war that changed everything. To this day, we are living with the consequences of World War I.    We all know, in broad terms the events & attitudes leading up to the war.The heir to the Austria-Hungarian throne, Francis Ferdinand & his wife Sophia, were assassinated in Serbia by anarchists. Austria needed to punish Serbia & prepared for war. They sought assurances from Germany that they would support them in the event of Russian intervention. Russia was an ally of Serbia. Germany, led by Kaiser Wilhelm was only too happy to oblige. But these things are never as cut & dried as they may seem. At the time, several of the royal heads of Europe were related. Czar Nicholas II of Russia, the Kaiser & King George V of Great Britain were cousins. Althogh friendly, they were suspicious of each other especially Kaiser Wilheim. Communications lagged. When Russia mobilized it did not mean the same as it did in Germany, that war was imminent. It simply was a heighten sense of readiness, nothing more. But all the eventual combatants had their own issues, which Mr. Fromkin explains in great detail. Germany felt that a general war was inevitable. They wanted to control the where & when. Europe had been at relative peace for 100 years. There had been localized skirmishes & minor wars such as the Franco-Prussian War, but nothing major. It was probably the longest period of peace Europe had in many centuries. So Austria wanted to wipe Serbia off the map of Europe & Germany would faciltate that. Even so, Austria wavered, delaying an invasion for many weeks. When it came it was weak & ineffectual. The Austria-Hungarian Empire was dying & everybody knew it. Eventually the dominoes fell & we had what is still known as the Great War.	2004-10-07

What you get here is a slanted look at Sinatra's life through lots of stories, from lots of people & that's entertaining, but we've heard some of them before. There is some obvious hero worship here by the author, but that seems to be the case with most of the people in Sinatra's life. We learn of his politics,(Democrat) his racial tolerance & hatred of bigotry. Yet he had a conservative, traditional side which he held closely.     There are contradictions to be sure in this talented, complex man. But that the case in all great men. He was always the leader & had to dominate any setting & set the mood.    He was quick to anger but also forgiving, loved his friends & was fiercely loyal & generous.    He was always a professional, giving his best to his fans. They were not cheated when Frank sang. He was his worse critic. Known as a one take artist as far as his movies were concerned, he was never satisfied with his singing, finding minute flaws in his most memorable performances. Sinatra & his closest friends, \\"the rat pack\\" if you must, had their own code & language. Sort of like the beatniks of their time.  Despite the obvious talents of Frank, Dino, Sammy etc. they reminded me of aging hep-cats. Sad really. Sad too, that they are gone.	2004-10-06

Fields: His Follies and Fortunes	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Not  likely I'd read  a biography this old on Fields,	But, this is one of the first & I do like the narration of Tom Parker.    I had preconceptions of Fields being a lovable, womanizing drunk. He didn't like public intoxication or drunks except maybe for good friend, John Barrymore, but he died of complications of the liver. I guess starting out the day with martinis for breakfast & continuing all day may have somthing to do with it. If he was a womanizer the author, Robert Lewis didn't know about it. Or maybe in the 1940's they didn't print such things. He was in fact married once, never sought  a divorce although he & his wife had been separated long before his death.     He was a raging paronoid, contol freak & notoriously cheap.  Fields thought he was a great director though nobody else held that belief. He was also very shrewd getting top billing & top $$$ on his way to becoming \\"The Greatest Juggler in the World,\\" & he may have been. The author covers Field's early life & struggles well. His movies by which we all know hime came rather late in his life. He was suspicious of everyone extremely hard to work with & generally a surly, nasty man. But he was never boring & always, always funny. People were drawn to him because he made them laugh, rather than being repelled by his personality.    We stiil laugh, thru his movies, today.	2004-08-30

The government is merely the facilatator legalizing & enforcing it's actions.  <br />  Oringinally written in the 1930's, Mr. Nock obviously had the rise of facism, in Europe, in mind when he wrote this book.  But today when our rights & liberties are being curtailed under the guise of national security it is again relevant.	2004-08-04

But its great comedy & if it changes any votes I'd be surprised. Dude isn't much different from Stupid White Men except it is more current. They will be read or listened to by those who will not vote for Bush, period. Consrvatives won't touch it. Certainly not our non-reader in the White House. It might cut into nap time. Are these books fair? Certainly not. Are there untruths in them? I don't know. It's comedy. As far as I can see at this point, any means fair or foul that dumps Bush & his junta should be used. Who's stupid? The white conservative media tops the list. They tried to stop Stupid White Men from publishing. Apparently we should amend the constitution. Then they tried to stop Dude.  That wasn't stupid enough, they even sued Franken to stop Lies & the Lying Liars. They created three blockbuster bestsellers & two multi-millionaire liberals. Way to go. Buy, rent, borrow them, read or listen to them. You deserve a good laugh.	2004-06-29

This unabridged audio version of Jenkins book came in two parts, part one slightly longer. It takes Churchill's life to 1940. Manchester's volume 1  &quot;Visions of Glory &quot;takes us to 1932, the beginning of &quot;the wilderness years&quot;.<BR>  Over all Manchester's book is longer. Jenkin's book doesn't dwell on Churchill's childhood or his parents Jenny &amp; Randolf. That's a plus. Jenkin's reader, Robert Whitfield does a passable imitation, without the lisp. Churchill also mumbled &amp; muttered much of the time. Mr. Whitfield, thankfully, does not. Jenkins does cover Churchill's early military &amp; journalistic career well. However, both authors seem to stint a bit on Churchill's opposition to dominion status for India. Jenkins does a little better with Churchill's relationship with the disgraced Prince of Wales &amp; his strained relationship with Georg IV.<BR>  Jenkins had some advantages as an insider being an MP during the last years of Churchill's life. He had resources at his disposal maybe Manchester didn't have. Plus his book is much newer by about 12 years.<BR>  Jenkins starts by providing a primer on terms,concepts &amp; traditions peculiar to the British &amp; their way of governing that American readers might not be familiar with.<BR>  If you are interested in Churchill you have or you must read or listen to these two great biographies. You won't be bored. I give the edge to Jenkins.	2004-03-18

Of course, unless you enjoy history, you're probably not reading this. <BR>   It's simple. Take a historical event &amp; create a plausible alternate outcome. Three examples stood out for me. What if the Allies had lost on D-Day? The Germans throw the invasion  back into the sea? It could have happened. Does the U.S. give up &amp; turn it's attention to Japan?  Does FDR get reelected? Mushroom clouds over Europe in 1945?<BR>   Pontius Pilate pardons Jesus instead of condeming him to death. Chtistainity is changed. No salvation through Christ's death on the cross. No cross, the ultimate symbol of the faith. Jesus dies of old age, confused, a great prophet maybe, but not the savior.<BR>   The French win the Franco-Prussian War or even if that stupid little war nevers occurs, history could have been profoundly changed. The unification of Germany could have been slowed down. The German Empire might not ever existed. Without that, a little skirmish in 1914 Europe would never have become World WarI. Without World War I, no World WarII, no Communism, no cold war.<BR>   Create your own scenario. Some of the histrians realy get into the aftermaths of their stories. Others not so much so, leaving you clamoring for more. But the reader or listener, can fill in the blanks. There are no right or wrong answers because it never happened.	2004-01-21

There is so much more to President McKinley than we know. Kevin Phillips presents his biography in an interesting &amp; informative way. This is a postive work to be sure &amp;  Mr. Phillps argues that McKinley is a near great or, maybe a better term would be highly sucessful president.<BR>  He learned well from his service in the Civil War &amp; and close associations with political allies &amp; mentors Presidents Garfield, Hayes &amp; Harrison.<BR>  Given TR's bombastic personality &amp; energy McKinkey comes off in comparison as dull, boring &amp; self effacing. He spent most of his time away from the job caring for his sickly wife. <BR>  However, it appears that much of TR's success can be traced to the McKinley administration. Although lackluster, he was well liked by both sides &amp; worked well behind the scenes allowing others to take credit for his accomplishments.  He didn't need the ego gratification of TR, Taft or Wilson who preceeded him. In temperment &amp; integrity he was much like his predecessor, Grover Cleveland, although they were political opponents. <BR>  As the 20th century drew near America was at a crossroads. McKinely guided the U.S. through those historic times with skill &amp; wisdom.<BR>   When he took office, The U.S. was just recovering from the worst depression in history. He protected markets &amp; wages rose.<BR>He redeveloped kinship with England that continues today. Then there was his &quot;Splendid little War&quot; with Spain. It propelled the United States into a new position of economic &amp; military significance. The United States then entered upon it own era of overseas expansion (Imperialism). This was all a percursor to what became America's Century.	2004-01-02

Dylan's work has endured of course &amp; Don't Think Twice &amp; Blowin in the Wind has spoken to every generation since. <BR>  From the book I got the the impression that Bob Dylan is somewhat limited intellectually. He spouts nonsense &amp; speaks thru his lyrics &amp; is truly a musical genius. He speaks against wealth privledge &amp; the establishement but embraces it. He is exempt. He cannot string two sentences together &amp; apparently was a lousy interview. In the end he has alienated all his old friends from his folk days, while continuing to gather more fans.<BR>   Joan Baez story goes beyond the anti-war protest she is known for &amp; delves into her music &amp; relationship with Dylan. It was (a least to her) more than just a affair. She really did love him &amp; furthered his career at the expense of her own. A totally amoral character he discarded her as he eventually does to all his relationship while denying his past, simply a boring Jewish middle class kid form Minnesota. <BR>   Mr. Hajda also covers at length Mimi (Joan's younger sister) &amp; Richard Farina. His life was a shooting star, a brief career with much promise. Mimi was along for the ride marrying him at 17. His potential brillance was cut short needlessly &amp; stupidly.<BR> The reader does a good job of imitating Dylan but other attempts not so good. Recommended reading for a good feel for the folk, night club, beat scene of the late 50's &amp; early 60's.	2003-12-03

It's value to me was Washington as a colonial officer under British generals during the French-Indian War. It is essential as this was the making of  the man &amp; frames everything that comes after.<BR>  A stupid blunder, of so many by the British after defeating the French was the denial of Washington a generalship in the regular British military establishment. It was the one thing that he wanted  or ever would want more in his whole life. Mr. Alden explains why Washington or any colonial could not hope for a career in the regular army. It chilled me to think of the course of American history &amp; world history if Washington  had remained a loyal British subject. Our history without Washington is hard to imagine. There was no one even close to his stature in America. So he did become a general after all. The rest of the book is  well done. Good reading for someone not too familiar with the first president, with a little revolutionary era history thrown in.	2003-09-25

But it was probably a bit much to get a definitive answer, even from John Dower's fine book. He does discuss the subject at some length. That &amp; the war trails were my favorite parts of the book (audio). <BR>   It served American foreign policy at the time to not prosecute Hirohito &amp; leave him on the throne. It allowed Japanese to cling to a shred of pride that indeed, they did not surrender unconditionally. It made occupation much easier &amp; assured civil peace. Actually he was a criminal but many of his ministers &amp; generals were  willing to die for their emperor. So they did. He was quite willing to let them. What a man. The Japanese hero worship of General McArthur was almost embarassing. I don't know why, but I thought of the reverence we once held for George Washington in the 18th century. The Japanese got over McArthur. <BR>The irony is the decidely undemocratic way we imposed democracy on Japan. Apparently nobody listen to the unabridged audio version as I did.	2003-09-04

He is an insider who longs for the good old days when people like him welded more power. He cries about it in his book consisting mostly of his old columns. He tackles all the players in the movie making business. First, the old mogols &amp; new money men, people we have all have heard of. He heaps scorn on agents we haven't heard of. People whose inflated egos are only surpassed by their greed according to Mr. Bart. He moves on to the stars, the directors &amp; their movies. The well known flops &amp; hits are reviewed. It is a bit dated now as this book consist of columns from as far back as ten years ago. He points to the acendency of agents &amp; managers over the money suppliers, thru their access to the actors &amp; directors. Many agents &amp; managers fancy themselves as producers which they are not, merely as a way to make more money for their clients &amp; in turn themselves. The lose of the the studio system, that Mr. Bart was a part of is what he misses.

But he was ok as president  realizing than in his own sphere of influence you have more power as general than president. Steve Ambrose has done a skillful job condensing two volumes into one. I'm not sure what he left out. Having read \\"At Ease\\"  written by Ike just before the presidency & \\"At War\\" written by his grandson this book dwelt on his presidency. Although it is a whole life biography there is not  a lot of attention spent on his greatest accomplishment in life: Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe.   <BR>   The image of Ike as a do nothing golfer is changing. While there was relative calm at home he was in his element dealing with international affairs. This required a disipline & organized mind, so in that sense his military background served him well. His political instincts were good & he did not rush to judgement.  Stevenson looked foolish running against him but how could have anyone have beaten him? He virtually ignored McCarthy & he eventually self destructed.<BR>   In race relations he was lost & did a poor job. He could have done more to advance civil rights but he merely enforced the law.  Ambrose goes into some detail on how he basically managed the \\"cold war\\". That it did not become hot is an accomplishment. You don\\"t get credit for bad things that never happen. The most unfortunate event of his administration was the U-2 that was shot down over the Soviet Union. Ike was striving for a nuclear test ban treaty that was to be the capstone of his career. Ambrose was a well known cheer-leader for Eisenhower but takes the reader through the painful cover-up that ensued. A sorry chapter in the saddest year of his presidency & the last. Ike wasn't comfortable with Nixon as the Republican canidate for president in 1960 but except for Rockefeller there wasn\\"t anyone else. He disliked JFK but his less than whole hearted support for Nixon may have cost him the election. This was a surprise admission of the author near the end of the book.<BR> Thathe ranks in the top third of all out presidents is probably a fair accessment.	2003-06-30

It is only tempered by the shabby treatment that Jim McDougal received not only at the hands of his friend, Bill Clinton, but also long time political ally, Govenor Jim Guy Tucker, Clinton's sucessor. Govenor Tucker, like McDougal, went to jail. Clinton did not & went on to screw  many others, figuratively & literally. Bill Clinton's charisma was such that long after it made any sense, McDougal, & especially his wife, Susan retained a great deal of personal affection for the president. Politically, being a \\"yellow dog\\" democrat, McDougal could do no less than support both the president & the govenor.<BR>  The political stories fronm an Arkansas insider are light & funny. Some universally true about politicas & others peculiar to Arkansas.<BR>  The legal morass that McDougal found himself & tries to explain make for rough going in places but these segments are brief. Any good ol' boy or political junkie will like this book.  As to the  veracity of this book, Mr. McDougal knew he was dying & in fact died before it's publication. Most people do not wish to leave this world with a lie. He had considerable help from Curtis Wilkie, a professional writer, which probably helped him keep it real. Lloyd James' narration made it seem as if it actually was the voice of Jim McDougal.	2003-06-09

This silence extended beyond his life to many books & even for a while, the memorial to him. He  referred to his affliction  maybe once in public late in his life. <BR>  The time he spent before & during his presidency rehabing in Warm Springs impacted on him in important ways. A strong bond  developed between  him, the people of Warm Springs & his fellow patients. That perhaps is the silver lining to his polio: the contact he had with ordinary folks he would never have meet, never would have had anything in common with except his disease.<BR> I think Mr. Gallagher might agree that being stricken with polio was the defining event of FDR's life. Before he was a political lightweight. He was a handsome, charming politician who thought he might like to be president someday. After, he became wiser, more sober yet still charming, less arrogant, more compassionate & a traitor to his upper class breeding. He became stronger, much stronger as a man. The strength he gained from this ordeal contributed greatly to his becoming president & eventually leader of the free world. An important work to read to get the whole Roosevelt.	2003-02-07

As it happens this book is very relevant today. Senator Trent Lott has been having problems with his segregationist toasts at Senator Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party & there hasn't been so much interest in the 1948 election since.... 1948.    1948 was a watershed election on several levels. It was the last elections of an old era of politics & at the same time, the first of a new. There were four major canidates. President Truman got down & dirty. His vitriolic, uncompromising partisanship would be unacceptable today. At the other end of the spectrum, milk-sop Governor Dewey, the big favorite, was too cool, emotionless & refused to fight. That stand pat attitude wouldn't fly today. Then Governor Thurmond was a southern Democrat, at best a segregationist & proud of it. He ran a credible campaign in the south & captured the electoral college in three states. Henry Wallace did not get any electoral votes. He was a former vice president & could have caused a constitutional crisis in several states where he was popular. Seen as the peace at any price canidate he was controlled by the communist & considered by some as Stalin's stooge. He forced president Truman to campaign a little further to the left than he wanted. That's four different major canidates. It will not happen again. It was the last campaign in which major canidates traveled by train in extensive whistle-stop fashion. Radio & newspapers were the media. Television was first used at the conventions but was primitive & did not impact on the election. As in todays campaigns a major concern was money, campaign financing & contributors. Governor Thurmond was always strapped for cash & got a little help from oil companies anxious to drill for oil in the gulf. Wallace actually charged admission to his campaign appearances. Then there were polls, polls & polls. However, polling was not the exact science it is today. Thus polling organizations missed some key demographics.They predicted for Dewey & we know what happened. One of my favorite photos of all time is DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN. Mr. Karabell pulls the whole election together in an informative & entertaining manner. Definitely five stars.	2003-01-15

Fredrick Davidson made it easy for for me in his fine narration on 32 cassettes.    This book is not just for scholars but it is a major biography on Peter the Great, indisputably the greatest ruler Russia has ever had (including her Soviet Union era). Robert Massey is to be commended & his research is excellent.     Czar Peter, literally dragged Russia kicking & screaming into the modern era. He did it, many times single handedly, by the sheer force of his personality. The greatest impact on his life were the two extended visits he made to western Europe. The first, early in his reign, was attempted incognitio. This was sometimes ridiculous as he was 6 ft. 7 inches tall & was easily spotted in any gathering. This visit fired his interest in the sea & his dreams of Russian seaports & a great Russian Navy. He actually became an Admiral, coming up thru the ranks.     The author digresses, with good result, into a series of mini-biograhies  on Louis XIV, William of Orange & others.    Mr. Massey devotes several chapters to Charles XII of Sweden. He was Peter's adversary in the seemingly endless Northern wars. These wars dominated Peter's time & energy for over ten years at the start of the 1700's. These were the years of the beginnng of the end for some of the empires of the middle ages. The Holy Roman Empire & the Ottoman Empire were in slow decline. Peter destroyed the Swedish Armies & Sweden never rose again to her previous prominence.   His discriptions of Paris in the 1717 & the impact Paris had on Peter were quite important for the changes that overcame St. Petersburg in the last years of Peter's reign. Peter borrowed heavily from  European culture as well as  technology. Few in Russia could keep up with his ambitions & aspirations for Russia.   Peter was a complex man with simple tastes. He was one of the few monarchs in history that was actually suited to the  ruling of an empire. Most kings thru history of the world were inbred morons simply ruling because of birth. He was a cruel man but not unsually so for his time. He was big-hearted, demanded loyalty & rewarded it. He was as just as a despot could be & above all, honest. He was Russia & Russia was him. Russia was better for it.  This is a large work in every sense & gives us a good feel for Russia & Europe as they entered the 18th century.	2003-01-03

He returned to it a decade latter a better writer. So he started over again. An excellent effort & better than vol. I, The Rise of TR, which was also excellent.<BR>   The accomplishments of his not quite two terms are impressive: Settling the coal strike, breaking monopolies, creating the national parks, the Panama Canal & enlarging the U.S. Navy Much of what he did still impacts us 100 years later. We know about  what he did. This book gives it to us in a detailed & yet interesting way. <BR>  That he didn't run for another term in 1908 is, in hindsight a tragedy. That he would have won there is no doubt. He was the most popular man in America & celebrated around the the world for negoiating an end to the Russo-Japanese war & winning the Nobel peace prize. Shortly after winning the 1904 election he promised he would not run again. That he had second thoughts there is no doubt. He would have been forgiven for going back on his word. But he had too much integrity for that. How different the world would be today. In the 20th century there are presidents of great intellect: Wilson, Hoover & Clinton. There are presidents of great moral authority: Truman, Carter & ...Ford. There are hightly sucessful presidents: FDR, Ike & the Gipper, & for sheer charisma FDR, Kennedy & again Clinton. In all of these admittedly arbitrary categories Theodore Roosevelt fits easily.<BR>   This biography is heavily weighted towards Roosevelt's political life with less emphasis on his personal life that being his wife, Edith. It may simply be that Morris wife, Sylvia Jukes was writing a major biography on Edith, Portrait of a First Lady at the same time. In fact, her book came out two months before his. He may have proofed it & maybe even backed off of Edith a bit, so to speak. Definitely five stars.	2002-11-27

A gentle satire on the self important, pseudo intellectual, white collar, martini guzzling, suburbanites living the good life in Connecticut while fooling around/making a living in New York City.    The story concerns essentially two couples, infidelity, sex, unwanted pregnancy & adoption. They deal with their problem in a seemly childish & ridiculous way ... by our modern standards somwhat dated. The author digresses several times going off on a tangent about some philosphical gibberish but very funny anyway. This is what passed for witty sophisticated humor 50 years ago.	2002-10-24

For 688 pages (31 hrs on cassette) Mr. Parett fills in the blanks.      First he spends sometime on Arthur MacArthur, Douglas MacArthur's father & hero. This first Gemeral MacArthur was quite an important historical figure himself. Everything Douglas did in his life he measured against his father & the standards he had set.    Many biographies deal with just his involvement is World War II, Korea & maybe World War I.  This whole life biography covers his West Point years, the Phillipines, Vera Cruz, Mexico, & his pre-World War I relationship with General Pershing & his mistress.     It is apparent that even one large volume gives brevity to MacArthur's life but Mr. Parrett does an excellent job. He also seems to have a slight bias towards MacArthur. He takes MacArthur's side in most instances except after Inchon when his judgement became questionable. But he does not shrink from his faults such as his huge ego, thin skin, inability to take advice or criticism & his foolhardy courage. Many times these character faults actually served him. His daily routine in the many places he served, his women, his only son, the many military leaders, presidents of many countries & his feelings about them are covered in this book.     A very complex man we were lucky to have as Supreme Commander in the Pacific. The Japanese were lucky to have him as their virtual ruler during the occupation of Japan. We were lucky again to have him in Korea--to a point. Inchon was the crowning achievement of his career. If he had died at that point he never would have descended to the status of mere mortals. His legend would have grown forever. His fall was swift & sad.    We were also lucky that he never became president. He toyed with the idea of running in 1944, 1948 & 1952. By 1951 he had not set foot on the mainland of the United States for 14 years. He was hopelessly out of touch with the people of the United States by that time.      I didn't know that FDR coined the phrase \\"dugout Doug\\".	2002-10-04

He actually finished the second half of it thirty years later when he claims he has enough time &amp; before he became too old. The two halves have been edited seamlessly. In this we see just hints of what England's future relations with the colonies will be. Franklin has considerable business relations with the British military &amp; makes his fortune in business by the time he is fifty. He is just getting his feet damp in politics being one of the framers of the Albany Plan of Union in 1754. There is much in this of the Franklin we do not know. It is informal &amp; personal. With all its facinating anedotes it would have been lost to the world if he hadn't been urged to write it. America first true international super star, but by the end of this book, not yet.	2002-08-16

Characters coming & going then reappearing later in the story. There are villians, heroes, heroines, conspiracy & even murder.<BR>   This excellent, informative work evokes two eras. First its subject matter giving us a history of Washington during the Civil War. This subject has not been covered as heavily as the various battles & endless biographies of the notable figures of that war.  The book was written 76 years after the war. Here we are 62 years after that listening to Ms. Leech words, also of a different era than our own. The language in which it was written is quaint, colloquil & even offensive to some in our time. That is part of it significance as an important work. It is also an entertaining history book. Imagine that.	2002-07-30

Doris Kearns does a find job exploring the psyche of this most complex, conflicted man. She had a unique opportunity, spending unlimited time with LBJ at his ranch after he had retired from public life. She is in fact his very personal<BR>biographer, this being a task he didn't want to do himself. <BR>  There is great reliance on his dreams & the interpertation of what they mean. The answers are simple & so pat that it is doubtful they were dreams at all but merely a vehicle for LBJ to explain his actions .<BR>   To her credit Ms. Kearns does not dwell on Vietnam. Important to be sure but this was a whole life biography & she did cover the war adequately.<BR>   Cultivation of mentors was a method used by LBJ throughout his life to better himself & led to his sucesses. However, by the time he became vice president he was own his own, isolated for maybe the first time in his life.<BR>  Like presidents before him & since LBJ labored in the shadow of FDR.

But I'm a sucker for World War II & FDR minutiae & I liked this book. Thomas Fleming has a problem with FDR & he has found his niche-writing revisionist history.<BR>  It is true that FDR did little to advance the cause of civil rights. But he was a man of his time: white, wealthy & paternalistic towards blacks, in particular. He was in fact more enlightened (with the help of Eleanor) than most of the power elite of the day. He also had to have the support of the white, southern bigots. That's called compromise. You get the best deal possible or nothing. <BR>  His treatment of Jews was way ahead of the American public. Internment of Japanese-Americans was inexcusable by any standards.<BR>  Mr. Fleming biggest problem with FDR is his insistence on unconditional surrender of Germany & Japan. In my view he misses the bigger, global picture of that strategy that could take another book to refute. But the effect of it on Germany, on military conspirators in Germany, on the Soviet Union & Japan have had repercussions even to this day. Any deal for less than <BR>unconditional surrender with anyone in Germany might have triggered a cease fire agreement between Hitler & Stalin. It almost happened anyway given Stalin's paranoia.<BR> In any case FDR had a war to win. He had a job that could have killed a healthy man, which he wasn't. Mr. Fleming writes with the 20/20 politically correct hindsight of a 21st century historian. It is still good reading.	2002-07-11

He had &amp; still has a pronounced love-hate relationship with President Clinton. It seems that Clinton feels the same towards him. Mr. Klein, in turn is impressed with the president &amp; all his talents: his communications skills, grasp of facts, connection with people &amp; vast intellect. He is equally disappointed by Clintons shortcommings of self absorption, sense of entitlement &amp; foolish personal behavior. Those weaknesses disgusted him (as they did all of us). Mr. Klein also gets some rips at Newt Gingrich, George W. &amp; Al Gore. In fact, Mr. Klein does not have much good to say about any &quot;boomer&quot; politicians. They have not the sense of honor, integrity, perhaps gravitas of Lloyd Bentsen,  George sr. or Bob Dole. But Clinton bested them all one way or the other. Clinton could not control his appetites &amp; that diluted everything he tried to accomplish. It made him an &quot;average&quot; president. In short, a great opportunity for him &amp; America was lost. <BR> This is a very well written book. As the years past there will be better biographies (including Clinton's own). But it now has the advantage of being one of the first. Mr. Klein's skill with the English language &amp; his vocabulary make him a very good writer. Read or listen to this one before it becomes history.	2002-05-14

When America entered the war,they had to share & they didn't like it one bit. They looked with distain & mistrust at the fledgling American intelligence efforts. They obstructed, were in flexible & fought for every inch of turf. The Yanks & the Brits both mistrusted the French. That &  lots of names was the first half of the book (audiotape). Frankly a little boring.<BR>   The book picks up as Mr. Casey gets a little autobiographical with his actual involvement in 1943. What the Americans brought to the table was economic intelligence such as the cost benefit of strategic vs tactical operations, air vs ground activities etc. This type of intelligence was apparently unknown to the British. Mr. Casey discusses the opposition, even in Germany & the military to Hitler & the Nazis It was considerable. He evaluates the resistance groups in the occupied countries. <BR>   The result is an entertaining, informative & inside look at Allied espionage in World War II.	2002-05-01

That the president had fore knowledge of Japan's attack has been an open secret for many years. Mr. Stinnett leaves no doubt. FDR may have not been prepared for the magnitude of the Pearl attack. He may even have felt that only Guam, Wake the Phillipines &amp; ships at sea would be attacked, but he knew. With <BR>85% of Americans opposed to war, Japan had to fire the first shots. Germany played her part too by declaring war on us first. Germany was after all FDR's primary target.<BR>   Of special interest &amp; the heart of the book (tape) were the eight points authored by LtCdr. Arthur McCollum. These were recommendations of actions to be followed to provoke Japan into war, It is unclear that FDR actually saw them but everyone of the eight points was followed. That is the real story of this book. Rafael Ferrer is a fine dramatic reader.	2002-04-26

Hitler shot himself & National Socialism was pretty much expunged from the world. The effects of Stalinism are still felt today. He died a relatively natural death being old & infirm.<BR>   The first few tapes of his youth & the early years of the Bolsheviks was frankly a little boring. It picks up considerably as we find Stalin as caretaker of an ailing Lenin who died in 1924. By 1929 he had eliminated all opposition. His rule & word were absolute until his death in 1953. This was not communism. It was Stalinism. He is the standard to be measured against for all despots before & since, an amoral sociopathic paranoid. This book is an overview & doesn't dwell on the millions of peasants, military officers & party members he murdered. More detail is in other books by Mr. Conquest. There are still a great many Russians who remember & revere Stalin as a true hero. Few revere  Hitler. That the Soviet empire survived until 1989 & as Russia today after 24 years of Stalin corrosive rule is a credit to the Russian people & their leaders.	2002-04-24

But this was  cooperation, not a partnership. The author strains for similarities. They were both poor boys growing up at the same time in mid-America 200 miles apart.<BR>   Childish & paranoid come to mind in decribing their relationship after Ike decides to run in 1952.  Truman's problem was he idolized generals such as Pershing, Marshall, MacArthur & Eisenhower. He would have stepped aside for MacArthur or Ike if either had wanted to run as a Democrat in 1948. Then he became paranoid that Ike might take him up on it. Ike said he wouldn't run & Truman thought that meant forever. When Ike did run as a Republican to deny Robert Taft the nomination Truman felt betrayed, even though Ike was doing him a favor. He attacked Ike & his character viciously. Of course Ike responded in kind. There were other issues mostly personal. Their foreign policy was seamless from one administration to the next. They basically ignored each other until Kennedy's funeral when they had to sit next to each other.

Well, no. It was a mere sideshow. But it takes center stage in this long (tape actually) book by Don Cook.  75% of what I now know about De Gaulle & Vichy 1940-45 came from this book. Not only is this a a full life biography but a fine history, most importantly World War II & De Gaulle's part in it & how he became the lone voice of the free French movement. He was the real France & never doubted it. It was his finest hour & if he had never done another thing in his life he would have been great. How he did it is another manner. Aloof, humorless, un-  compromising & always right he was one of the few men that FDR actually disliked as well as distrusted. These poor relations caused FDR & to lesser degree Churchill to cling much to long to Vichy as France. They stupidity refused to recognize De Gaulle's free France when it was obvious to the rest of the world he was the only game in town as far as the French were concerned. He made England & the United States pay for this snub for the next 30 years for he was also an unforgiving man. The    other major coup (& coup is the correct word) of his life was rescuing France from itself In 1958 & creating the Fifth Republic. He wrote a tailor made constitution that made him president for a seven year term. That he could have installed himself as dictator for life is probable. His love for freedom & independence for all men is indisputable. De Gaulle was France, France is De Gaulle. Even now, 30 years later.	2002-03-27

This work includes Theodore sr., Bamie, the Eliots, Quentin, Kermit, Anna & all the rest. This is not American history. It is family history: one family two clans, Hyde Park & Oyster Bay. Their orgins from the 17th century are discussed briefly including the split. Then it proceeds with Teddy's childhood. He was sickly, almost dying several times, except for his father Theodore sr. He was a great man & loving father. He undoubtedly made Teddy the man he was to become. He was worthy of the veneration TR carried for him all his life. Theodore sr. died early. So did Eliot \\"the golden boy\\" TR's brother & Eleanor's father. The impact that Eliot had on his daughter was huge &  mostly negative.<BR>  Being a son of TR was tough. He & wife Edith were good, attentive, loving parents. They had four sons, all filled with a passion to measure up to TR. It wasn't enough to enlist in World War I but to see action & if possible get wounded. Talk about pressure! TR probably didn't see things in such a harsh light but the sons felt this was the way to please their father. It killed the youngest son, Quentin. Of course they never rose to TR's heights. But a cousin did: Franklin Delano. His life started out differently with an older father he didn't know & a domineering mother. He studiously followed TR's path: state legislator, under Secretary of the Navy & govenor of New York. As good parents that TR & Edith were FDR & Eleanor were terrible & neglectful. The way their children turned out was somewaht predictable, racking up 15 divorces amongst them. The Roosevelts rank up there with the Adams, Kennedys & Bushes(?) as great American political families.  This was from the the audio version & throughly enjoyable.	2002-03-07

He had it. He was a strong president in an era of weak &amp; little remembered presidents between Lincoln &amp; Roosevelt. He stands out if we take a little time to consider him. His was not a towering intellect but he worked hard at understanding everything that came before him. He was somewhat bereft of political skills but didn't care &amp; didn't work at it. His fiscal responsibility &amp; insistence on honesty &amp; merit in the civil service gained him no friends in many of the big city political machines that existed in that era.<BR>His integrity &amp; decency did not allow him to compromise when he knew he was right. The tariff issue was one such example of his integrity &amp; cost him the election of 1888. But he came back in 1892, the first &amp; only president to do that. Unfortunately, that is what he is most remembered for. Paul Jeffers has written a popular &amp; well publicized book on this very good but obscure president.

If you know little or nothing about this religion of 900 million people, this is a good place to start. As a belief system, Islam & Christainity are not that different. But the differences between is illustrative & what I got out of this book.<BR>The founder of Islam, Muhammed, is not worshipped as Jesus, the son of God is. He was a man, a warrior, a businessman, a father, husband & of course a prophet & dies as a man.<BR>His life is to be emulated, not worshipped, for he had the faults that all men possess.<BR>While Christainity is  hierarchical, the pope & the bishops being very important, there is no similair structure in Islam. In Islam the Koran is the final arbiter. It is not as flexible as the Bible has been over the centuries, open to the interpretation as popular culture dictates.<BR>Most important is the belief in separation of state & religion. It does not exist in Islam. The religion is part of the politics of the country. In many nations where Islam is the predominant faith, indeed it is the Koran, that becomes the final arbitor of foreign policy. Perhaps it is this last point that baffles & worries leaders of western civilization so much. I see a lot of hits on the reviews of this book before mine.

One thing above all Ms. Levin wants to make clear. After his stroke, Wilson was never again competent to be president. The deception that ensued is the real point of the book. Ms. Levin hates Edith Wilson. Mostly for the memoirs she wrote sometime after Wilson's death. It is false, selfserving re-  visionist history, that became wildly popular and regularly accepted as the definitive work from  of the Wilson presidency. It was later made into a major motion picture with Edith approving ever word of the script.  Ms Levin seeks to destroy that work quoting from it often & then blowing it apart. It seems credible that Edith was the defacto president for the last 16 months of his administration.     If Woodrow Wilson was not a dirty old man he certainly needed a woman at all times: for sex , unquestioning obedience & loyalty to him. He got that essentially from three woman: his adoring & adored first wife, Ellen who died rather suddenly early in his administration, his mistress Mary Peck, who he visited regulary in Bermuda before he married Edith. Soon after they met, Edith & he were joined at the hip, figuratively & literally. She was able with much sucess to isolate Woodrow from those he relied on most notably Col. Edward House, as they took him away from time spent with her. Their personalities did not complement each other as they were the same. They were petty, stubborn, dogmatic paranoid & uncompromising in their principals.  So much were they alike that actions taken by Edith in secret could very well have come from the president... up to a point. The cornerstone of Wilson's presidency, the one thing that would have made him perhaps the greatest president of all time was the   U.S. entry into his own creation: The League of Nations. As written the U.S. Senate would not, did not ratify the treaty. A few revisions, a word here & there would have won the day. Wilson thru his wife did not budge.She did not have that in her. Perhaps if the president had been lobbied his sense of what was about to be lost would have prevailed. But we will never know. Plus Wilson hated Senator Lodge & Edith did not have enough character to bring these two men together. The comfort & protection of one man by one women changed the history of a nation & the world.     One mistake in the book. In the photo section is a picture of The Wilsons posing with royal family at Buckingham Palace, December 28, 1919. Not likely since Wison was quite incapacitated at that time. Page 395 indicates that on December 20, 1919, Wilson was wheeled out of the White House for an \\"airing\\". Nor could he have been in Paris on December 14, 1919, as another photo indicated.	2002-01-28

Not that Gleen isn't smart. It's just that there is no pretense to the man. His stories are interesting if his delivery leaves something to be desired. They reveal little about the inner man. It is a standard, straight ahead autobiography of a man who isn't a writer. He was sucessful in several different fields then retired to do the best part all over again. Hero is an overused word today. But he's a real one. That's a go. So are his memoirs.	2002-01-11

It merely ignored,	marginalized &amp; denied by the perpetrators. Most people are aware of  &quot;the rape&quot;. It gets a paragraph in most history books. I    thank Iris Chang for adding a major mainstream book on the subject. It can only add to the pressure on Japan to confront this stain on their national reputation. Ms Chang's story is a chapter in the much larger war of annihilation waged by Japan against the people of China. This war made hardened Nazi recoil in horror. Ms Chang recounts the days before, how could it have been prevented &amp; the absymal condition of the Chinese army unable or unwilling to put up even token opposition despite superior numbers. After a while her blizzard of numbers becomes to much: number of rapes, numbers of murders, combinations, numbers of torture, those used for bayonet practice etc. They  become meaniless. Her suggestion that Japan pay reparations (such as The United States did to its Japanese citizens intered in World War II) is unrealistic. More real is an official apology from the Japanese government. Maybe when every Japanese soldier form World War II &amp; their next of kin are dead will that apology come.	2002-01-07

Japan has come a long way in 70 years. Thanks to Herbert Bix there is much more light. Not only is this a fine biography on the Emperor Hirohito it is a pretty good history of Japan especially the war years, 1930-1945. Mr. Bix has the propers for the job. He married into a Japanese family, is familiar with the language &amp; had access. This is a book for the average American interested in the subject. It is evident that Hirohito is not the kindly, courteous, humble old man we saw in the last half of the 20th century. It may not have been Mr. Bix purpose but it is evident that Hirohito was a war criminal. His knowledge of the atrocities in China, Pearl Harbor &amp; treatment of POW's is unmistakable. He was very involved in the unsucessful defense of Guaducanal &amp; the unsuccessful attempt to retake it. That he was not not tried as a war criminal was a function of United States foreign policy fronted by General McArthur &amp; a good story in itself. A very interesting but not exactly easy read.	2002-01-04

It is also a whole life biography rather than the well trod grounds of Grant, the general or Grant, the president. They are an important part of the biography, to be sure, but there is so much before & after that is less known.   The point is made several times By Mr. McFeely that if there had been no Civil War there would have been no Grant. That is, he was a loser & would have been a nobody. It seems to bother the author that it takes the horrors of war to raise some men above others. However, Grant is not the only person that the Civil War elevated to greatness. Grant also knew this but didn't dwell on it enough apparently for Mr. McFeely liking. He was what he was.  Grant disliked his West Point years & was indifferent to the military as a peacetime career. But he was good at war. What he wasn't, was rich & he spent his time before the war & after his presidency chasing get rich quick schemes. They all failed. Ironically, writing about the war revealed a hidden talent. His memoirs written at the end of his life made Julia a very wealthy widow. The long passages concerning the scandals & corruption in his presidency are tedious at times. He was basically an honest man who didn't know how to stop it. His dream of annexing the Dominican Republic as a state & his plans for Reconstruction were abysmal failures. Especially interesting was his 26 month around the world tour after his eight years as president. He came back too soon & attempted to recapture the presidency in 1880 after a four year absence. But although he was was still loved & revered by most Americans there was no groundswell for him to return to the White House. His years in the White House were not his finest hour. Sort of \\"thanks but no thanks.\\"   Mr. Riggenbach's narration was just right & lent itself to long periods of listening without fatigue.	2001-12-12
US	50869055	R23EPBLDSIS6OV	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	34	36	N	N	In the past John Adams may have been decribed as a Founding	Father & left at that. Such an unfortunate phrase. He was so much more & may finally getting his due. I wouldn't have believed David McCullough could top his Truman. But he did. The book doesn't strictly follow history. Very little on the American Revolution in America. But that's ok because  Adams spent most of that time in Europe. Perhaps it was his most important time. Certainly more than his vice presidency because he had to shut up. As president his single term was in many respects a failure. How could anyone follow Washington. Nobody could & he knew it & Jefferson knew it also. He had the benefit of four years buffer that Adams provided. One of the two most important things he is responsible for is avoiding a war with France thereby foiling Hamilton's plan for empire in the southwest. The other good thing was the creation of the U.S. Navy. He had many enemies real & imagined. Maybe because he always told the truth & was very self-righteous about it. His most important advisor, the one who would never desert him or stop loving him was of course Abigail. McCullough dwells on her at some length as he traces the progress of Adams life & their many years of separation.   We know all this & more because they wrote it all down & saved their letters to each other & others in & outside of the family.  Adams kept a 50 years diary. Perhaps with an eye on history that would vindicate him. This is an epic work.	2001-11-28
US	50869055	R2P8ESS6647A5L	0786117176	801476517	John Quincy Adams	Books	4	2	2	N	N	JQA was his own worst enemy.	His father was disliked, disagreeable & opinionated. According to Paul Nagel, JQA was all this & more. He was deeply neurotic. Yet he is the most eminent man of his time. He could never live up to to the expectations he had set for himself. It is doubtful he knew himself what they were. Mr. Nagel chronicles his life as a student, scholar, legislator, ambassador, Secretary of State & President. Listing President of the United States last is apt since it is by far the least of his accomplishments. Actually it was an abject failure. His youth was spent in Europe as a scholar, student & interpreter for the Russian royal court. This made him highly unsuited  to do anything respectable once he returned to America. He became an attorney & hated it. He turned to politics & found he was good at it. Although it would be political suicide to admit it then or even to day, the happiest days of his life appeared to be spent in Europe, speaking French. First, as a teenager in Holland and later as Ambassador to Britain with his English wife, Louisa.    Nagle version of Abigail Adams is quite different from McCollough's version in his book. Whereas she was a loving, selfless, indespensible wife to John Adams, she appears to be a meddling, insensitive, cruel & guilt inducing mother & mother-in-law. We know so much about JQA because, just like his father, he kept a 50 year diary of his life, leaving more information on his life & times than the next eight presidents combined. Highly recommended reading or listening.	2001-11-23

I have been watching him on \\"60 minutes\\" for so many years. This is my favorite subject, World War II, & this first person account is better than most. It should be, Rooney's a pro. He was mentored by the best writers of his time working as a reporter for \\"Stars & Stripe\\". Talk about on the job training.     He saw the the war on the western front up close & then was able to walk away from it & write about it. He wasn't in real danger on the front. The real challenge was when he rode along on a B-17 bombing mission & they came under attack. Quite a life changing experience, I'd imagine. Also the best chapter in the book.     He recalls some of the people he had to deal with. He saves special scorn for General Patton. He mostly has high praise for the men he met, worked with & those who never got old . He was an enlisted man who had the best job in the war. He appreciated that, not being a particularly military type.      The best part about this book is that he writes it now while he still has all his marbles & is a much better writer than he was then. The drawback is he is writing this book with 60 years hindsight. Things might not have been as he now remembers them. Still the book is as truthful, I believe as Andy Rooney could make it.     For us boomers who will never exprience such a time or place it is a fine read.	2001-10-19

They have treaded lightly on his isolationism, his Nazi support &amp; anti semitism. This book is not so kind.<BR>I might never read a biograhy on Coughlin, Smith or Lewis so the information on these three historic figures was valuable to me.<BR>That FDR manipulated The United States into World War II, as the isolationist even today contend, is probably true &amp; the subject of more than a few books.

He also spent more time in England than any of the &quot;founding fathers&quot;. This is a biography but also the history of how the British lost America thru their own stupidity. Franklin had a logical &amp; forward thinking mind. He knew that America would not be a colony forever. That America could be ruled for much longer by a small island accross the the ocean was not reasonable. But that would happen long after he was dead. His coming of age politically was The Albany Plan of Union in 1754 which dicusses such proposals as uniting the various states &amp; a constitution. This was all in the context of remaining in the British Empire. This book is his story of disaffection &amp; final break with the mother country. Truly America's first world wide celbrity.	2001-06-15

An entertaining one hour speech peppered with anecdotes covering the failures & successes  of Truman. There may never have been a person to succeed to the president as unprepared & in such a time of national crises. We were about to invade Japan with perhaps two miilion men & 600,000 casualties.   One thing he did know. He could not be Franklin Roosevelt. Nobody could. He had to be Harry Turman. He knew himself, grew into the job & ranks as one of our near great presidents.   Apparently the most important experience of his life was World WarI which he could have avoided in several ways. He found he was brave, he could lead men in adversity & he liked it.   He had known disappointments, hated farming, failed as a businessman & was largely ignored as \\"The Senator from Pendergast.\\" He was honest, stubborn to a fault, loyal, humble but most of all confident in his abilities.

US	50869055	R3CZQ7IQH4CG4Z	0786100893	966649042	James Madison: The Founding Father	Books	3	9	11	N	N	James Madison just wasn't cool...	not like Jefferson & Hamilton or celebrated like Washington & Franklin. My fellow reviewers seemed disappointed in this as a biography. But it was not Mr. Rutland's purpose to write a personal story of Mr. Madison's life although his later years were covered quite well. I am  glad, however, I took the easy way out by listening to the audio version (unedited). It was as if I was in Mr. Rutland's class as he was giving a lecture. The years after The Revolutionary War, The Federalist Papers, The Constitution & The Bill of Rights, are the real meat of this book. Madison's behind the scenes leadership in Congress was consummate. If we do not appreciate how important he was  200 years later, it seems that he contemporaries did.  To his sorrow he was, with Jefferson, responsible for creating the two party system we now operate under. That he wanted to heed Washington's advice against the party system is evident. But he found this advice quickly outdated. As a result Washington, & to a lesser extent Adams were the only unaffiliated presidents in our history. Happily, none of this two-party stuff is cluttering up our Consititution. As Secretary of State under Jefferson & President on his own he was unremarkable. Any one could have mucked things up as well as he did. Indeed his best years were his early years. What seemed to me remarkable was the love, respect & friendship that existed between Madison & Jefferson all of their adult lives. It was an alliance of two great men that never wavered & recreated the \\"republican\\"  type government of ancient Greece. Mr Rutland was obviously impressed by this relationship & alludes to it several times.  I appreciate biographies that teach me something about history I didn't know. How great is this book? Hard to say. But it fit the bill.	2001-05-11

I read it several years ago &amp; was going to read it again but instead opted for the audio version. To me, Edward Hermann is the next best thing to FDR. This is Doris Kearns Goodwin's finest work.  This a social history. It is about life in the White House during World War II. FDR surrounded himself with people whom he loved &amp; who loved him. But it is also about what the president needed.   What he needed was a support system as he dealt with the war. He had a grand plan. It was like a blueprint. But the only copy was in his mind &amp; only he knew how all the parts fit.   Eleanor shows up from time to time to generally bum him out. Where her council was valuable on domestic issues during peace time she became a depressed head case when FDR didn't need her as much, the war becoming his top priority. The war was all a healthy man could handle &amp; FDR was not well. She did not see his declining health &amp; pushed him. Her hectoring drove him back to the old love of his youth, Lucy Rutherford. She gave him what he needed in his last days without asking for anything in return.  This book is not an easy read necessarily but it is easy to stay with &amp; is throughly enjoyable.  America has been lucky to have great leaders in her times of greatest crises, (Washington, Lincoln &amp; FDR ), who were equal to the task.	2001-01-08

That MacArthur &amp; Churchill &amp; FDR are related (how?) &amp; that you can't fart at 30,000 feat are examples of the factoids in this book.

Carl Sagan believes it is important to take the time to explain, for layman like myself. He is pretenious at times but he doesn't talk down & makes complicated subjects clear. This book is not for people who cannot change their pre-conceptions or do not have a curiosity for worlds they are not trained for. People who cling to pseudo-science, faith healing, channeling, alien abductions etc. are probably not reading Carl Sagan in any case. Dr. Sagan, more than anyone wants to believe in alien visitation but real evidence is not there.  He is persuasive in his faith in science over that of a supreme being. However, they are not mutually exclusive. One requires proof, the other, faith. Every time I read or hear something by  Sagan, I want more. Unfortunately, this is it.	2000-11-27

I realize that baseball is the game of statistics more than any other. But the game has a more prosaic side. I live for stories about baseball, the opinions, arguments & nostalgia of baseball as it was 60 years ago.

But then he would go on: \\"nine days in the early part of 1941 neither the Dodgers or the Cards were in the lead. First place change hands seven times in June. Huh?

The story of Mickey Owens rough play & passed ball, Lefty Grove's struggle to get his 300th win: that's the ticket.

Doris Kearns Goodwin, who is a top rank presidential historian in her own right gives a speech written by David McCullough. Strange. Franklin Roosevelt was a patrician who literally abandoned his own class to defend &amp; help all the people. The masses of America somehow knew this from the start &amp; responded to it. He genuinely like everyone or was very good at giving that impression. Most people loved him. But he never let anyone in, get too close to his heart. He seemed not to have a mean bone in his body. Yet he was made of steel, leading America thru two of its worst crises, one on top of the other. What did he know &amp; when did he know about Pearl Harbor?  Hard to say, but in this case, the means definitely justified the ends.	2000-11-17

He talks in glowing terms on the inner Ike, his integrity, respect for subordinates, sense of humor &amp; decency.  Ambrose says Ike was no paragon of virtue but he doesn't believe that. Ike was a segregationist &amp; women's rights were foreign to him. These faults &amp; others are passed over lightly.

If you can handle Marvin Kitman's repeated attempts to knock Washington off his pedestal you'll enjoy this book. I was one of those public grade school kids who labored under his stern contenance. He must have been god. Or at least god's right hand man.    We outgrew this. We know he was just a man. A highly flawed man according to Kitman. Flawed, yes, but also good & lucky. George Washington was America first celebrity. We weren't going to be denied. He lost most of the battles but he did win the Revolutionary War. Actually the British tired of it and lost it. This ultimate politician was not political. In essence he was the only game in town. He had Morris & Hamilton as his spin-meisters, shady land deals & girlfriends (Beginning to sound familiar?). He looked like a hero, acted like a hero, mostly told the truth although he didn't talk much. He was very brave & loyal especially to the electoral college delegates.  Kitman asserts that the U.S. Constitution was written especially with Washington in mind. That may be true. They both have survived, no thanks to Kitman	2000-10-23

Meirian &amp; Susie Harries do not flinch in painting an unflattering potrait of America's first foray into a major foreign war. (The Spainish-America war doesn't count.) The French are also skewered as defensive minded, arrogant &amp; totally disdainful of the Americans. Considering the source the Brits get off easily. But this is an American story &amp; it is unique. The army started from ground zero. Its make-up was unlike that of any force before it. Italians, Jews, Poles, Germans, Irish &amp; so many others. These varied ethnic groups would not have associated much with each other at home, during peace. But real nation building for America  &amp; a sense of self came out of the war; for the price of 50,000 Ameican lives. African-Americans were the the exception. They could not serve with white American soldiers. They were used as cannon fodder to fill the holes in the French army at the front. The French who had little use for the the American army &amp; its tactics were effusive in their praise of the abilities of the black soldiers they served &amp; fought beside. That the war accelerated  many changes in America society cannot be disputed &amp; the Harries do a good job discussing them. The United States got nothing tangible from the peace after World WarI. The Allies wanted none of Wilson's idealism for a new world. France &amp; to a lesser extent England wanted revenge against an exhausted Germany &amp; this guaranteed a future war. It is understandable that the United States turned, with some disgust, away from Europe for over 20 years.	2000-10-18

Churchill was already regarded as one of the greatest men of his time. This was due in no small part to his great sucess as a writer. Yet he was out of step, the times being what they were: a nation being led by craven, small brained men concerned only with the bottom line. I found myself talking back to the tape (in essence, talking to myself) at the fools running  H.M.G. & the Foreign Office in the 1930's. It is as if Churchill is the only person of stature who knew Hitler & what his intentions were.But he is on the outside looking in. This was the \\"peace at ANY price decade\\" & not one for which England can be proud. Every country in Europe was sold out as the Greater Reich swallowed The Rhineland, Austria, The Sudetenland & Czechslovakia & threatened the rest including France. His fall from grace was in part his own fault. His obstinacy on India's Status & his support of Edward VIII, the future Duke of Windsor past the point of reason did not help him at all. His integrity, honesty & vast output of writing in books & articles kept him in the public eye, until as we know, he was called to his finest hour.	2000-09-22

I've been meaning to read At War for some time specifically to to get David Eisenhower's perpective. It's a perpective most historians would  kill for. As a kid David had the run of the White House. The familiarity he  gained from comtemporaries of his grandfather-generals, aides, heads of  state, friends &amp; even other historians was invaluable. His admits this.  The book look daunting at first glance, but is quite readable &amp; I was  able to stay with it for hours at a time. ha-mevaker is correct. This is a  political rather than a military view of the war in Europe. Military  matters are of course the backdrop for the political intrigues Ike is  subjected to. The personal stories are appreciated &amp; humanize the whole  horrible war: The young private from Abeliene simply walking up to  Eisenhower&quot;s H.Q. &amp; demanding of the guard to see Ike. He got his  audience with the general as well as a signed note as proof to his buddies.  The book is peppered with little stories like that. The  Eisenhower-Montgomery feud is covered extensively. Surprisingly,  David is  more even handed &amp; perhaps more understanding of Monty's motives than  other American historians have been. By D-Day Britain was finished. She was  bankrupted, &amp; would never regain her former glory. Montgomery knew this  well. The men lost could not be replaced. Yet he wanted one last moment in  the sun for Great Britain, that of a spearhead into Germany &amp; the  capture of Berlin by the English (&amp; himself). In this plan he was  over-ruled by Eisenhower, his superior, a general with no battlefield  experience. He was a great patriot &amp; it galled him that by this point  the British Empire was the junior partner in the U.S./British alliance.    Churchill was proponent a defeating Germany thru Italy &amp; did not  support the Normandy invasion. He experienced the carnage of World War I  trench warfare feared a repeat if a frontal assault was attempted.  Eisenhower greateststrength was he wasn't fighting the last war as many of  the people around him were. He was fighting the war he had before him &amp;  he did it quite well.	2000-09-19

This is a cultural history of the United States, that tells America's  story in a fresh entertaining way. Not really a book for scholars. It shows  generation by generation how each group  arose to impact &amp; be impacted  by the steadily accelerating &amp; expanding world they lived in.  I got  the impression that generations of young people were thrust into certain  crisis in our history &amp; dealt with or failed to deal with them. This  gives a certain  antagonsim &amp; lack of faith between generations. The  fate of the nation hung on the next generation being able to adapt.  Examples of this are plentiful. The differences between the revolutinary  generation &amp; the next one destined to hold the new nation together were  essential.  The generation that failed to address the problems that led to  the Civil War &amp; the generation that had to fight &amp; die in it cannot  be ignored. Maybe the most important differences in suceeding generations  that still impacts our lives today is the generation that created the  conditions for the Great Depression &amp; ultimately our entry into World  War II and the generation that grew up in the depression, fought &amp; won  the war &amp; then proceeded to dominate the world for the next 20 years.  The flip side is the commonality of alternate generations. The GI  generation, the generation that Tom Brogaw refers to as the &quot;Greatest  Generation&quot;, has much more in common with the Boomer generation that  it does with the the Silent generation that immediately follows it, or the  Lost generation that preceeded it. They were an agressive, sucessful,  globally important group as I believe Boomers are. But as nuturing caring  parents both  genrations leave somthing to be desired. They were loved  &amp; desired as children. The Millenial generation, still being born seems  to be the same. The Silent Generation, was was more inwardly directed, more  nuturing &amp; trying to find a place out of the shadows of the GI's.No  member of the Silent generation will ever be president. The X generation  seems to have some of the same problems &amp; assets as the Silent. A  continuing expanding economy will help them the most. The book is already  dated but some of its assumptions are pretty close.  Of course they haven't  accounted for the vast changes in just the last eight years such as in  communication, the internet (&quot;the information super highway) &amp; the  global village concept. But then nobody could.	2000-08-11

In this he is more than your average historian. This subject has been trod over before(even by the  author). However, if the reader(in this case, the listener) learns  something new, then that time is well spent. I did assume that Churchill  replacing Chamberlain as prime minister was met with wild acclaim &  Chamberlain was in disgrace.  Neither of these notions were correct.  Churchill had to earn the support of the people & more important the  confidence of the war cabinet. Neither of these happened until after  Dunkirk. Chamberlain was an important player, even though he was dying.  Churchill leaned on him and needed his support for he was still well  thought of. I did have more empathy for him than I had previously. Mr.  Lukacs brought that to me. Halifax was also a player, but  an appeaser much too long. Being sent to America as ambassador was a good move & used his  fine skills as a diplomat while keeping him out of Churchill's hair. Hitler  disliked Churchill intensely. Many of his plans were predicated on the fact  that first, Churchill would never become prime minister & secondly once  he was prime minister he wouldn't last. Hitler wanted peace with England.  Indeed, he had never wanted war with her in the first place. Churchill  would have none of it. But it was not without anguish & second guessing   that Churchill decided that if France fell England would go on alone.  Hitler stopped short of the channel. This was not merely  a stick to his  generals & show who was boss. It was also a carrot to England to show  he wasn't going to slaughter British & French troops on the beach.  Hitler surely knew that his air force could not destroy the B.E.F. from the  air. They were suppose to surrender. But instead 340,000 men escaped to  fight another day. By the last day of Dunkirk, it was obvious that the  planned invasion of England wold never take place.  The Axis went on to  several more years of sucess but Lukacs contends that this was Hitler's  zenith and he would not win out in the end.  England did not & could  not win the war. The United States & Russia did that. But equally  important, in 1940, England did not lose it.	2000-08-10

He doesn't take himself  too seriously &amp; the self-deprecating humor works. He doesn't bog the  reader down with dry economic theories of which he has a few. He has saved  those for other books he has wriiten, (I presume). He lets you in on some  of the policy-making  of the Clinton administration during the first term.  The object was not only to get the president's ear but to be the last one  to get it. Stuff that we are not normally privy to.

This is a group that Muggeridge  despises yet he was one of them. They enjoyed their life of privledge &amp;  luxury while mouthing the glories of the &quot;Dictatorship of the  Proletariat&quot;.

The degradation of the environment in  one area may wreck disaster in another, thousands of miles away.  Some of  his thoughts are flights of fancy. Others could be done by presidential  fiat, in other words, without the meddling of a Republican congress. It  would also require a president with the courage of his convictions. On the  environment at least Albert Gore has that. Clinton doesn't & neither  does Bush. Considering that alternative, the way Gore gets elected almost  justifies the ends.

When I visited President Truman's home &amp; gravesite earlier this year, this book came back to me though I read it several years ago. It was a fine reference &amp; provided some  background to what I saw in the mueseum. It even provided me with answers  to questions our fine mueseum guide didn't have. This may be a definitive  biography for an overview of Truman's entire life, as there are fine books  on World War II, the Korean War &amp; the election of 1948 (The Last  Campaign comes to mind). I felt as if I wanted to send a copy to President  Clinton  although I suspect he knew of it. The dark days of 1946 &amp; 1994  when the Republicans gained a majority in congress were very similar, as  were the come from behind victories of both men in 1948 &amp; 1996. The  other reason was for the moral clarity that Truman seemed to have. We have  no better example of a man growing into a job. Truman did. Lucky for us.	2000-07-24

Then the story picks up. Much in this story of friendly espionage is known to historians. Thomas Mahl pulls it together, fills in & adds  some sordid new items. I recommend it to those interested in the  mechinations of the British in the United States before our entry into the  war. Franklin Roosevelt was up to his neck in conspiracy with the British  to discredit isolationist by any means, legal or not. The British moved  covertly on a scale that FDR & his administration could not have  conceived of on their own.  The Office of Strategic Services, the prototype  of today's CIA was created by the British. They also installed their own  man, but an American, Bill Donovan at its head. A federal investigation was  launched against leading isolationist Congressman Hamilton Fish. Mr. Mahl  shows how the British engineered it. When testifying at the trial of a  German national, British agents perjured themselves. He had in his  possession a map describing the invasion of South America by Germany. It was forged by the British secret service & planted on him. Their perjured testimony convicted him. The British attacked Standard Oil of New  Jersey for their dealings with I. G. Farben a German company. They were  accused of creating a cartel to drive up oil prices. This critism was found to have come from inside British Intelligence. U.S. Public opinion polls were just starting to come into their own. British intelligience was able to publish polls  that showed American support for entering the war on Britain's side. This actually was never true, until Germany declared war on the U.S. Very little could have been accomplished without the complicity of an  interventionist press. Those writers were numerous and well known including  Walter Lippman, Dorothy Thompson & James Reston. Marshall Fields founded the Chicago Sun-Times to counter the editorials of the isolationist Chicago Tribune. The ChapterI found utterly fascinating was the author's  claim that the British, with FDR's connivance, co-opted the Republican  National Covention in 1940. They were able to install the dark-horse canidate, Wendall Wilkie, as the GOP nominee against FDR. The thing is, he  supported the president's views on extending the draft one more year & Lend Lease. The Repubicans in Congress & the Senate opposed both of  these measures. But it is pretty difficult to oppose your party's standard  bearer. The British got Lend Lease which was their goal. Wilkie was so well  thought of by FDR & the British that he was for a short time considered  for the vice-presidency by the Democrats in 1944. What a disaster that could have been! The sordid stories of beautiful female agents compromising  prominent Americans was also an interesting sidelight. Are these stories true? Undeniably some are. But they all add up to a entertaining book & a well read audio-tape.	2000-06-15

Unfortunately their hands are soaked in blood. Desmond Steward endeavors to compare & contrast the two dictators. This is done alternating back & forth  telling their stories from the beginning. He succeeds in this. Hitler may  have been loathe to admit it but it appears he took cues from Napoleon  although his hero worship of Fredrick the Great of Prussia & admiration  of Clauswitz is evident. Perhaps he had a desire to succeed where Napoleon  failed. This in turn hastened his own departure from the world stage faster  in fact than Napoleon. Emotionally, they were bound by their common  meglomania & absolute belief that providence had decreed that it was  their destiny to rule Europe-and beyond. England tormented them both. Each  had elaborate plans for the invasion of Britain. Both had moments of  clarity when even they realized that an invasion would not succeed.  However, Napoleon warred constantly with England with a few years of  suspicious peace. Hitler did not wish to fight England at all & tried  more than once to make peace. Neither could match England's navy. They were  essentially land-lubbers. Their ruin, of course lay in  their invasions of  Russia. The Russians played the same game twice. Fall-back, fall-back &  then let the famous Russian winter finish them off. Both could have  succeeded. After conquering vast areas of Europeon Russia they could have  both sought a favorable peace. It would have brought all parties the time  they needed. The Czar wanted peace. Likewise, Napoleon was bleeding France  white. Stalin wanted time for the allies to establish a second front in  western Europe. Hitler needed time-off from fighting on two fronts. It  could have happened except  Napoleon's ego and Hitler hatred of  bolshiveikism & the Russian people in general prevented that. They  departed on their views of race. Napoleon felt the Jews an asset to France.  We know Hitler's views. Napoleon died a slow death onthe island of St.  Helena in virtual seclusion & thus was able to nurture a heroic legend  through his writings. History has treated him more kindly as a result.  Hitler had no such luxury. He committed suicide in his bunker while Berlin  crumbled above him. As for the narration, Fredrick Davidson's use of French  & German pharases sounded arrogant and was off-putting. His  impersonations of Hitler & Napoleon sounded like Beldar Conehead.	2000-06-02

Adams knew this yet respected &amp; envied them. He also knew  his intellectual gifts surpassed the big three of the revolutionary  generation. His integrity &amp; forthrightness made him a most disagreeable  person. He rationalized his unpopularity, feeling that virtue with fame is  no virtue at all.

Young Adolph comes to Liverpool to live with his brother Alois  &amp; his Irish wife. He is to helps his brother in his new business. But he cannot do anything right. He is depressed &amp; paranoid.

But when you think it is really a living (sorry)  link to our past. In some cases these men, if they didn't die suddenly, planned their gravesite complete with epitaphs. It is a real connection.  The Washington memorial is very dramatic but it was started over 40 years after Washington's death.  The Lincoln memorial is wonderful, but Lincoln's not there, neither is  Jefferson.  I plan to visit them all and this books is a very handy guide.  The added benefit is a chance to see America. From Vermont (Coolidge) to  California(Nixon), to Iowa(Hoover) and all the others spread through out  our country. The last words of the presidents (when available) was a nice  touch.	2000-05-02

The best part of the audio was the telling of The Revolutionary War from the losers without bitterness but with humor. The coming together of the United States &amp; Britain was excellent. Great Britain, at the end of the  19th century was the greatest power on earth yet had no alliances with any  major power. It really didn&quot;t take long for the two most powerful  English speaking nations in the world to warm to each other. It is an  important subject that has not been covered entensively in American History  books.	2000-04-07

But I was looking forinformation on his infatuation with Hitler and the Luftwaffe. Nothing!The audio version does talk about the &quot;America First&quot; movement &amp; his &quot;alleged&quot; anti-semitism but skipping entirely the many trips he made to pre-war Germany is really inexcusable. Either this is a really bad editing job or a whitewash of an important part of his life.	2000-03-29

This book, &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot;,  is a short but highly readable book you need to start knowing the man as well as the president. We find he is the first self made man, that is he was born in poverty. The first  &quot;up by his own bootstraps&quot; type whereas the first six presidents  were born to the wealthy elite. More importantly he was the first westener,  that is, at that time, the first president to represent people living west  of the Appalachian Mountains. These, and many other factors, Mr Remini  points out impacted on how Jackson's presidency differs from those before  him. By streaching &amp; expanding executive power he changed the federal  government from a congressional dominated government to a presidential  dominated government during his administration. He vetoed more bills than  all his predescessors combined. Mr. Remini expands his studies in lengthier  books such as &quot;The Course of American Democracy&quot; and &quot;Andrew  Jackson &amp; the Bank Wars.&quot;  But if your serious about studing  United States history linger on the Jacksonian era and read this book first	2000-03-28
US	50869055	R3KQKSN3XL75SN	0345339029	693970523	The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt	Books	5	5	6	N	N	One of the finest biographies I've read.	Although Mr. Morris goes into minute and somtimes mundane details of TR's life, I was never bored. Mr. Morris had, of course one on the most extrodinary characters in our history to work with. TR amazed his  contemporaries &amp; still captivates us a century later. He is a giant  &amp; it's very obvious how far we &amp; our leaders today have fallen from  his standards.  Morris does not cheerlead for TR. But recounting his early  life points the direction that even the people of his own time saw. This  was the making of one the greatest Americans of all time.  This is a 12  year old book but still the finest biography of Theodore Roosevelt I have  read. I too eagerly await the second volume.	2000-03-27

I believe you really have to have an interest in Mrs. Roosevelt to get through it. She was truly  FDR's most important advisor. Not becauses he  wanted it that way but others in his administration would defer to her.  The book talks about many of her back door power plays to the annoyance of  the president. These are amusing stories but too infrequent.	2000-01-03

Even so this biograghy was almost as much about Kennedy's dad, Joe, as JFK himself. However, their  relationship really explains a  lot about Kennedy's later life, the story we all know about. Hamilton did a  wonderful job &amp; the research was exhaustive. I hope Mr. Hamilton is  able to complete the job.	1999-11-24
