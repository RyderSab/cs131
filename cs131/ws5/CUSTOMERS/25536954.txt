The book starts with a good, intuitive discussion of sets and the axiomatic method, but follows with a sketchy description of truth tables. The rest of the book is similarly uneven. It is best when introducing some topics with extensive motivation. Its main weaknesses are in the completeness of the explanations and the clarity of the proofs. Several of the proofs were the cause of much head-scratching. That shouldn't happen in an elementary text. There were several spots in the text where the train of thought is not clear. Sections that I particularly thought were sloppy and inadequate were the development of cardinals and the Axiom of Choice.<br /><br />As math textbooks go, I've read better, but for an undergraduate introduction to set theory, the competition is not very impressive. There are 23 errata listed on his web site. It is a simple matter to pencil in the corrections. One book you should consider as an alternative is Hrbacek & Jech. If the high price is an issue, the text by Stoll does a good job with the basics.	2005-07-12

It assumes no previous set theory or logic course, but does assume you already know the basic notation of set theory. It is for students with a fair amount of mathematical maturity who just never got around to taking set theory. The style is clear, concise, and has many good examples. It's a slim book, meant to be covered in one semester. The writing is much better than Devlin and coverage is more representative. I would like to see more details, but that would make it too long for the intended use. The only serious complaint I have about it (other than the price) is that the index of notation is ridiculously inadequate.	2005-07-12

It assumes you have already had a basic course and starts right in using the concepts of axiomatic set theory and the properties of cardinals and ordinals, although it does start with a terse recap of logic and ZFC. The whole book is narrowly focused on leading up to the technique of forcing to prove consistency results under ZFC. It mostly avoids large cardinals, the Axiom of Choice, descriptive set theory, and model theory. <br /> <br />The style is fairly readable, but I thought it was a little too messy for clarity. Without the key points being highlighted, I tended to get lost in the details. The early chapters have few exercises and not many examples. The last chapter on forcing is the big payoff of the book and has lots of exercises, but still a shortage of examples. <br /> <br />I don't think it makes a good reference, because it is not concise and clear enough. The monograph by Jech (3rd edition!) is vastly better for that. Even if you are currently using Kunen for a class, it is worth referring to Jech to clarify points in Kunen.	2005-07-12

It takes an unusual approach in that it emphasizes back-and-forth construction rather than formula satisfaction. The second half is a treatment of stability theory (ca. 1970s) meant for professionals. His style is entertaining, but he often gets to the point in a long and roundabout way. Important points are embedded in the text rather than isolated as definitions and lemmas. Just a couple of the early chapters have exercises and not very many. With the idiosyncratic style, dated approach, and nonstandard coverage, I wouldn't try using this as a main text.	2005-07-12

A large part of the reason is that there is little competition, but it is also a good book on its own merits. The author writes with a clarity and concision you rarely see in a math (or any) textbook. Proofs are straighforward, not tricky or convoluted. There are many excercises and with detailed setup. The exercises are often quite hard, requiring significant extension from the text. <br /> <br />Although the writing is good, that doesn't mean it is easy. He progresses deliberately through the details, rarely giving an overview. I think he is just expecting that you already have a good sense of context from the undergrad logic course you took (didn't you?). Sometimes he seems to belabor a point. There is also a dearth of examples, just five in the whole book, three of them in the appendix. There are no references at all. The age of the book makes it, not wrong, but inadequate in some areas. Still, I have looked at alternatives and haven't found something better for a graduate survey text in English.	2005-07-12

I think the success is due to its stock of valuable material rather than the quality of writing. The style is dense, descriptions are overly brief, and explanations are poorly laid out. Proofs are brief and sketchy. Overall, it is just poor writing. Take a look at Odifreddi to see recursion theory from someone with a talent for readable prose. <br /> <br />It says no previous logic course is assumed, but you actually need set theory and basic logic from the beginning. Also, coverage of the basics is cursory, so it would help to have done something like Cutland.	2005-07-12

There is no set theory, no second-order logic, and almost nothing on recursion. Many basic concepts are given cursory mention. In fact, nothing seems to be developed as fully as one normally sees in an introductory text. The whole book seems like a jumble of information rather than a coherent narrative.

As you will see if you ask around, it wasn't completely successful. That is because, while Rogers is creaking with age, it is interesting. This book is not. It is a detailed and orderly presentation of what the author thinks is important, but that does not include any context, motivation, relations to other math, or applications. It is painfully dull. (There is a 2e in the works, but the excerpts I saw were about the same.) Also, it starts very fast and will be confusing if you haven't already done a book like Cutland. I think the problem is that he has been a master of the subject for so long that he can't put himself in the mind of someone coming to the material for the first time.	2005-07-12

It assumes a mathematical logic course and a year of graduate algebra, preferably with Shoenfield and Lang. Since it is recent and has selective coverage, it is probably a good guide to what is currently rated important. Delivery is sometimes very terse, using heavy notation. Proofs are not remarkably good or bad. References to the literature are there but not extensive. I thought the application to other fields was weak. <br /> <br />My main complaint is that it didn't make me feel that it was introducing a coherent field of study or illustrate why it should be interesting. The author doesn't develop a context or explain where he is going. It feels like just a march of one detail after another, sometimes decending into a jumble. <br /> <br />The strength of the text is that it is very explicit in what points it is making and what exterior ideas it is resting on. I expect most instructors would choose it for that reason. They should just be prepared to spend a lot of lecture time building context for the material.	2005-07-12

The writing is clear and exercises are interspersed and follow naturally from the explanations. Proofs are explanatory and easy to follow, though often rather informal. <br /> <br />However, it looses some of its best qualities about halfway through the book. The early chapters give excellent context and motivation, but by chapter 4 that is mostly gone. It seems that the push to cover more topics is what led to making the introduction of new topics more and more brief. The later chapters give little feeling for how it all fits together and why we should care. You can look up the same topics in Rogers or Odifreddi to get an idea of the interesting things that could have been said.	2005-07-12

The prerequisites are not stated, but I would say undergraduate logic, graduate algebra, and a good deal of general mathematical experience. Motivation and context are very good and examples are frequent and clearly illustrative. What makes it challenging is that many details are glossed-over without the reader being warned about what knowledge is being assumed. His proofs also make many off-hand references rather than include every detail. Another thing I think it could use is more illustration of procedures; all of the examples seem to be of cases rather than methods. Still, explanations of specific points are often much clearer than in Marker.	2005-07-12

The first three of seven chapters form a very quick survey of naive set theory. Since it aims at a more advanced audience, it is not as explanatory as Enderton and the exercises assume more maturity. Chapters 4 - 7 survey some advanced topics that aren't part of the usual introductory set theory course. These chapters have no exercises. <br /> <br />The development lacks a lot in clarity, exercises have only cursory introduction, and the author tends to get ahead of himself, assuming material before introducing it. The text by Roitman is much better and is targeted at the same audience.	2005-07-12

It slights number theory, second-order logic, nonstandard analysis, and set theory. There is only enough on recursion and computability to support the main topic, but it goes deeper than usual on limitative results.<br /><br />What it does cover it does very well. Motivation is rich and exercises follow well from the text. Proofs are very clear. Overall, there is much greater coherence in the development of ideas than you usually see in a survey text.<br /><br />While the writing is very good, there is a shortage of definitions, examples, and exercises. Notation is not always clearly introduced and they adopt so many abbreviations it's hard to keep track of what things mean. I also thought that it was not as clear in the second half, maybe due to the multiple authors. Still, I would choose it over Enderton unless you need lots of exercises for class use.	2005-07-12

It is a thick book and covers a lot of interesting stuff, but there can be a frustrating lack of order and detail. He is an engaging writer, but sloppy in that he gives only part of the information you need to understand something, forgetting that he didn't give it or you don't know it. Sections are often either too sketchy or wordy and unfocused. Sometimes, though, he comes through with an elegant explanation of something. He is at his best when relating recursion theory to science, philosophy, and other branches of math. These discussions tend to be rather handwavy, but he gives references to the literature. The book as a whole is not very unified and it doesn't clearly indentify and relate the central ideas of recursion theory, so it wouldn't make a good introductory text. But it is a good reference for those with a moderate background.	2005-07-12

The preface says this was intended as a one-year course in the foundations of math for upper division math majors. The delivery is slow and gentle, rather wordy, and a bit stodgy -- not always crystal clear about what point he is making. It is suitable for students who have no experience with higher math. I don't know about students at the author's school, but I think it would try the patience of most seniors or grad students in math. I would recommend it more to lower division and philosophy majors.	2005-07-12

Explanations are generally not tight and memorable, proofs seem loose, there are sometimes gaps in the train of thought, and exercises often require a significant conceptual leap from the preceding text. It was particularly annoying the way he suddenly switched to Polish notation for a while and then just as suddenly dropped it, without any obvious benefit. However, it is more accessible than most mathematical logic texts. The main competition for this text would be Ebbinghaus, which I prefer. The benefits of Enderton over that book are that it covers a wider range of topics and has a lot more exercises.	2005-07-12

Get Cutland. <br /> <br />This book was written by philosophy professors and shows it. When philosophers write math, it is less concise, organized, and complete than when mathematicians do it. This was meant as an intermediate logic text for philosophy and math students, but it would try the patience of a math major. The explanations are wordy, sketchy, and poorly related to each other and to exterior topics. <br /> <br />The contents fall into thirds: Turing machines, aspects of decidability, and a hodge podge of topics from other parts of logic. The 4e is 50 pages (17%) longer than the 3e. The changes were mainly adding exercises and making the chapters more independent. The authors were obviously trying hard to make a readable text, but I hated slogging through all that verbiage. You can see a lot of comment in the other reviews that the 3e was better, but I think even the 3e is poor compared to Cutland.	2005-07-12

But it doesn't compare well to more recent books. It is relatively slow and important points don't stand out well. It would benefit from a lot more examples. And it is much too focused on ultraproducts. The third edition does very little to update it; it just adds sections 2.4, 2.5, 3.5, 4.4 and a few pages to the Open Problems and Historical Review. Reading C&K along with Marker, Hodges, and Poizat, I felt that C&K was the only one that added nothing interesting to the others. If you really need to read about ultraproducts, Hodges has a good description.	2005-07-12

B&M is larger than Shoenfield, having additional chapters on Boolean algebra, intuitionist logic, and nonstandard analysis. There are a few newer things in B&M and they use the tableau method, which Shoenfield doesn't. Otherwise, they have about the same coverage, trading off as to which has more detail on this or that item. The main difference is in the writing style. The delivery in B&M is less articulate, proofs are terse and schematic, and problems have little setup. I find it harder to follow the train of thought in B&M than in Shoenfield and would not want to try learning anything for the first time from it.	2005-07-12

The only thing it requires is familiarity...with the basics of general topology, measure theory, and functional analysis, as well as the elements of set theory...\\"<br /><br />He says the target is the beginning graduate. I would place it better as a 2nd-year grad course. The text is dense and moves fast. Readability is pretty low. He never introduces a topic with context or overview. Extensive references to the literature were deliberately left out, which I think is wrong since it is a textbook. On the plus side, it is sprinkled with many exercises. (BTW, this is one of those cases that make you wish Springer didn't make authors do their own typesetting.)<br /><br />There are only three common texts for descriptive set theory: Kechris, Jech, and Moschovakis. Jech has less detail on Polish spaces, Borel sets, and co-analytic sets, so it is not really a substitute, but its conciseness is nice and it makes a good companion. Moschovakis was a big deal when it came out because it collected a lot of information for the first time. But I don't think it is so good in content or style that you should be concerned if you have only Kechris and Jech.	2005-07-12

That makes for a lot of ground to cover, but Jech did a great job. The writing is very well organized and clear. Every short chapter has many exercises, often with hints. There are extensive sections on applications of forcing. The indexes are really good.<br /><br />There has to be a down side, of course. In order to squeeze so much in, he had to be brief. There is little context provided, especially in Part I: Basic Set Theory. There are rarely any examples and only the main facts are covered. That is all part of an understandable compromise, but I have a serious complaint (my only one) about the references. He gives detailed historical references in each chapter, but no references to further reading. He could have done it with hardly any use of space and it would have been very helpful.<br /><br />Because of the brevity, it is a bit hard to learn from, but it makes a great secondary reference. For example, its explanations are often clearer and more direct than in Kunen and with more detailed proofs. It you are going to have any more exposure to set theory than an introductory course, you will probably want to buy a copy.
