US	49707731	ROS3FSEGC1Z56	0805424881	253143954	Written on Her Heart	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Great Potential, but Predictable	When I started this novel, I thought I was in for a big emotional ride. James character was awesome. Molly character was to whiney. When Molly's friend Steph comes to visit her, Steph takes Molly out to buy her a book for her birthday. Steph JUST happens to pick out the one and only James Wade poetry book, the author is Molly's long lost love. Isn't this a little TOO much coincidental. Outside the book shop, Molly opens it up and JUST happens to find a poem in it that James wrote to her years prior.<BR>I think the ending was a little out of the obvious as well, James ends up rescueing Molly and himself in a fire. This novel had great potential, however, very predictable. Maki did a great job on James and his feelings, thoughts and reasons for staying hidden after his war injury, this part was very well written. Molly could have been a little more pepped up and detailed than she portrayed in this novel.	2002-04-14

When I started reading \\"Message in a Bottle\\", I thought I would go to sleep. I have to admit that I struggled with this story just about 3/4 of the way through. Then Bang! The last three chapters were awesome. The true feelings of Garrett and Theresa finally came out. Once this took place, this novel is a tear jerker. The last three chapters are long, but I simply could not put this book down until I finished it. I never shed a tear until the end and buddy let me tell ya, it took me by surprise. The ending liked to have killed me. I would have never thought it would have ended the way it did. Hats off to Sparks once again! He keeps you at a low level in this novel and then when your ready to almost completely guess the outcome, he takes you on a rollercoaster ride from the wild. I had many friends who said, \\"keep reading the story, it will pick up\\", I had no idea that \\"Message in a Bottle\\" would be one of my most favorites by Sparks. If it as slow for you as it was for me, hang in there. It starts out as a typical love story, you think you know the out come, keep reading, your heart will get an emotional twist that you would have never expected. Last three chapters pack a wallop, have your tissues ready!  Thanks Sparks for another incredible story!!	2002-03-16

When Adam realizes he can't marry Natalie and must marry Julia thanks to his father's doings, he is devestated. This romance gets a little slow in some chapters but then it pumps up. It is a typical story of two people having an affair that must be kept classified, but, in the end, it will bang you with a surprise. It's worth the read.	2002-02-13

This was my first Coben novel and let me tell ya, I haven't read a mystery like this one in quite a while. Every chapter keeps you going and going, it was all I could do to put this book down. Coben does an outstanding job on the characters. They seem real and not over done. Beck and Shuana's character's were the best. Shuana (Beck's sister's lesbian lover) tells it like it is. Beck is determined to find the truth about his late wife Elizabeth, or, is she really his LATE wife? This is a rollercoaster of ride, but one worth taking.	2002-02-13

The scene starts in 1908, when Maryanne and David meet. They get married and have a daughter, Andrea. This story is so well written and the character's seem so alive. It will capture your breath and your heart. Start with The Christmas Box and then Timepiece and finish with The Letter. It's hard for me to say good-bye to David and Maryanne. I feel like I was actually in the story with them. I could feel all the emotion in each chapter. Richard Paul Evans out did himself on this series. Get your box of tissues ready and take a ride with the Parkin's, you will not regret it. Your spirit will be lifted and you will think about this story long after your done reading the series. Additional characters, Catherine and Lawrence really make a difference as well. Such devoted friends to David and Maryanne.

Bravo!! &quot;The Letter&quot; concludes the love story of David and Maryanne Parkin. You must read &quot;The Christmas Box&quot; and &quot;Timepiece&quot;, to capture the entire story. Set in the 1930's, Evans did a wonderful job portraying this era. The events, the characters, the places, all well written. This series is one of the best I have ever read. David Parkin is a incredible man. Maryanne is a wonderful, understanding, loving person. Together through their loss of their daughter, Andrea, their lives go in different directions.  David sets off on a journey to find answers. As he was abandoned by his mother at six years old, his feelings always haunted him. When Andrea dies, he virtually relives the same feelings, even worse, only this time shutting out Maryanne from his heart. Maryanne makes a major decision that will break your heart. Their love for each is so strong and real, you can feel it just by reading this love story. I can't leave out the characters of Catherine and Lawrence as well. Their part through-out the series is very touching and two very dedicated friends to the Parkins. The ending was incredible. I won't say how it ends but only that I wasn't expecting it and I had to have a box of tissues. As Evans bids farewell to the lives of David and Maryanne, so do I. It was an incredible love story. Don't pass this series up.	2001-12-30

This is a very short story but packed with more meaning than you can imagine. The Christmas Box was well written by Evans and will touch your heart. I read it in two nights. Even when you are finished reading this story, you will still think about it for a long time. The ending will never leave you. Evans writes these characters like they are every day people. It is not a story that seems fiction at all. Even though the title reveals The Christmas Box, this is a good story to read anytime of the year. It will touch your heart.	2001-12-20

The characters were so well written, I felt like I was actually in their lives hearing and seeing everything in the story. John and Abbey Reynolds fell in love. They got married. They had kids. They lost each other somewhere in the middle of all the growing years. John had his thoughts and reasons, and Abbey had hers. This story shows the power of God and how He does work miracles. This may seem like a tragic story of divorce, but it is also a wonderful story about John and Abbey, and their love for each other. I could not put this novel down. The ending was so incredible, they.......can't tell you, read for yourself. I know alot of people that have gone threw the same pains as John and Abbey. This hits home for alot of couples. The strength you will feel not only from John and Abbey, their kids and family but the strength from God. You must read this. This is also good for anyone who is having marriage problems.

I think the chracters were very well written, but way toooooooo much about Bill and Isabelle's feelings, the chapters went on and on about how they felt about each other. You get the message loud and clear on that after about three chapters. The ending was not what I expected. It just kinda of ended with - no bang. This is a good read if you want to pass the time reading a love story, but if you want a page turner, don't bother. My favorite by Steele is still by far, Malice.	2001-12-04

I would have liked to have seen a more exciting, heart moving ending, then what there was.

This story takes you back to the 19th century when romance and marriage where a whole different story from this day and time.  This is one of the most romantic &quot;fairy tales&quot; I have read. The character's are written very well. I fell in love with Lachlan, the minute he enters the story. I thought Kimberly was so unique and without a doubt, most charming and ladylike. Megan and The Duke are simply the most enchanting host and hostess. Kimberly's father, Cecil, could take a hike for all I cared, and in the end, he actually does! I won't say &quot;how and why&quot;, you have to read this!!! Lindsey had me so drawn into this book, that I felt like I was actually there, I simply could not put this book down. If you have never read any of Lindsey's books, now is the time to start, especially if you love a good ole fashionable romance that takes you back in time. This was an uplifting novel, I can't wait to read her others.	2001-03-21

Koontz was amazing with these folks. I don't think I have ever read a thriller with a character quite like Junior Cain. Talk about physco, this guy is beyond that! Koontz did such a unique job on this maniac. There were times when I would cringe and other where I would laugh over Junior! I really enjoyed the way Koontz wrote small, short chapters, even though the total was 83, it kept you in suspense each time you started a new one. I also enjoyed Tom's character as well as Barty and Angel, both of these children are amazing prodigies, the ending was awesome with what the three of these can see and feel.  It will take you into another world. Hats off to Koontz on this novel. This is a must read story, I could write all day about this one, just get it and you will be amazed!	2001-03-19

The characters were written so well, I felt like I knew them myself.  Dianne is an incredible person, the unconditional love she gives her daughter Julia, who was born with birth defects. Her strong heart for over coming the blow of her husband Tim leaving her when Julia was born. If I could have had a word with Tim myself, I would have blown him out of this world! At first when I started reading this story, I thought, &quot;This is so cheesy&quot;, but man, I changed tunes about half way through the book. Amy's character will warm your heart and take you by surprise as well as Lucinda. Even though the story is really about Dianne and Julia, the others fit in so well and make it seem so heart warming. I have to admit, Alan, Tims brother almost seems to good to be true. Get your tissues ready and enjoy a heart warming story. The end will simply make you cry - Julia's Story. Some how I felt so much better about how Julia felt and what she really understood after I read the ending, you will absolutely close this book and think about it for days, It is definetly a story of &quot;Following the Stars Home&quot;,as difficult as it was, Dianne did, she followed her heart!!!	2001-03-07

This was a very long read. There are certain chapters that do crawl at a turtles pace, however, the detail of everything is worth it! The characters were very well written. From the beginning, King draws you in to the terrible fate of Mike Noonan, a novelist who's wife dies unexpectly. As Mike gets writer's block he decides to go to his summer home in hopes of breaking that block and to find out more about his wife's death.  Once he arrives at &quot;Sara Laughs&quot;, the bone chilling and teeth rattling begins. King captures the &quot;spirits&quot; of the past, and Mike finds them waiting for him. I could go on forever about a &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;. You must be patient as you read this novel, just when it slows, it then follows with a big bang. The romance part of this novel will have you in tears, get your tissues ready. I highly reccommend this novel for anyone who loves ghost stories. King really knows how to write them. Fasten your seat beat and take a whirl with Mike Noonan and his lingering spirts at Sara Laughs.  You will fall in love with the phsyic child, Kira. The ending is incredible, will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand. Hats off to King once again!	2001-03-05

I thought I was in for a wild ride, however, that did not happen. The characters were vague, with the exception of Turner Gibson. His character was the only one that kept me in suspense. The rest of the chapters were very SLOW. I think Campbell could have put some more power in them instaed of chasing rabbits. I'm sure when trying to find a biological parent, it can be long and hard and very emotional, but in this novel, it was total dead ends with no spunk. I was real disappointed in the ending, one part of it was good but the other part left you completely hanging. I thought the plot about what the doctor did over thirty years ago was carried out - waaaaaaaaaaay too long. This was not a fly by your pants book. If your in the mood for something slow, this would be for you. No tissues needed, just be patient.	2001-02-28

The intense relationship between Jaine and Sam was awesome. Being a woman myself, I know some of the topic's a group of girl's can get on. I loved &quot;The List&quot; these four friends came up with. It happens all the time when you have a group of out spoken girls discussing their relationships and sex lives. This novel added a twisted plot of their conversations, that turned a work environment upside down and made national news, all because 4 ladies decide what their version of Mr. Perfect would be, I loved it. I have to admit, the killer in this story really surprised me. I think Linda Howard did a great job on this one. This novel will keep you turning the pages, and you will never suspect the true killer until the end. Hold onto your seat as you twist and turn with this one, especially with Jaine and Sam. I absoulutely loved Jaine Bright's character.	2001-02-21

Sandra Brown is one of my favorites, however, The Switch was disappointing. I thought the characters were very vague. The only thing that did surprise me was in the end, regarding the twins, even then, I felt that I was hanging still wondering about certain things. I felt there was no definite closure on this novel. This novel needed much more detailed accounts of everything. In my opinion, Brown did not think all the way through on this one or even left certain things out that really needed to be there. Even though alot of thriller/mystery writers want to leave you hanging, there was to much missing in this story. I will not let this one ruin my confidence in Brown on future books though. I have read many of her novels and have loved them.	2001-02-21

I agree with one of the other reviewer's about dropping some of the chapters regarding Marion and J.T.'s personal life, however, in the end, it does fit in. I did not like this book as well as &quot;The Other Daughter&quot;. I thought Gardner did a good job on the character's.

I think the doctor is one of the most evil and wicked characters I have read in a thriller. In my opinion, this was a turn off. Don't get me wrong, a thriller needs to be juiced up, however, this doctor was just pure sick. I think Koontz went a little overboard on describing the doctors games in the past and future, it was to grocely detailed. Overall, I would recommend reading it only if you like groce and evil villians, Koontz does a good job on this guy.	2000-11-01

I have to admit, I felt for Therese, and could not wait to find  the outcome for her. It does seem a little unreal how Rebecca came back  into Therese's life and virtually took her away from Michael and Devon, in  a sense, to easy. The best part of this book is the twisted plot of Michael  and Devon. I wish the ending would have went into a little more detail of  Therese's new life.  Good book overall.	2000-08-23

Avery's strength and dedication to help Tate and let others believe the real &quot;Avery&quot; is gone must of been hard for her. Avery's character is just devine! The  love and support she gave Mandy was so heartwarming. The plot about Tate's  real wife was mind blowing. Hats off to Sandra Brown on this novel. Sandra  is one of my favorite writers. This is a definite pager turner that you  simply can not put down. Bravo!	2000-07-18

It drove me crazy reading chapter after chapter about someone different. There were several main characters, that by the time I got to a  chapter about them, I forgot who they were and where they left off.	2000-07-18

People don't realize that this kind of thing does happen, and yes, with step-families. I thought the parents did the best they could with this situation. The plot leaves you not knowing what really  happened, and that is the point of it. In real life when such tragedies  occur, especially teen rape, who knows who's telling the truth. I admire  both of these parents for not siding with either or child, and they still  continued to support their children the best they could. I felt that both  Bruce and Emily needed guidance and love during this, I never really knew  what exactly happened. The characters seemed so real. This book is about a  modern day step-family with a major crisis.	2000-07-17

The only thing I enjoyed about it was &quot;Lizzie&quot; and Janet Catchpole&quot;. The story seemed to focus more on Ben and not enough on Frankie. The chapters of Ben's dreams were  terrible. The only reason I finished the book was to see the outcome of  Frankie. I was so disappointed that there was not much said about Frankie  or Lizzie in the end.	2000-07-17
