I was captivated by the story and characters. The world that Donaldson conceives was fresh and full of interesting creatures and beings. <br /> <br />I was surprised to run across this book in my local library and had to read it. I was surprised how much of the preceeding stories I did not remember. A lot of the details were lost, and even with the explaination in the beginning of the book I still felt detached from the original stories. <br /> <br />That being said, I struggled a little getting back up to speed with the chracters, and stories. I thought the story was very slow to get moving. This would have been expected if I came through it with a good feeling about the names, events, and places being refernced in the story. <br /> <br />Luckily, the story started to clink for me and by the end of the book, I was ready for more. I am very glad (and surprised) that Donaldson decided to add another trilogy to an already classic tale.	2005-08-29

I was excited by the topic and at first the story was engaging. However, only a few chapters into the book, and I found the repition and rambling to be excessive. I was determined to see the story through. Unfortunately, the end did not bring the story to a satisfactory end. There were too many story lines left hanging that didn't seem to add to the story. <br /> <br />I was also disappointed in the main character. I have rerad books that had characters you associate with, love, hate, and despise. The main character in 'The Third Translation' did not evoke any of these emotions. I found myself bored by his background, position, and his decisions. <br />	2005-08-29

The world of Harry Potter was thrown into disarray in 'The Order of the Pheonix', when the Ministry is attacked and a character close to Harry is lost. Now the plot grows thicker as more questions arise about the true loyalty of Professor Snape. <br /> <br />This books continues to the exciting adventures of Harry Potter and his friends as they try to deal with Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Since the battle in the Ministry the wizarding world has acknowledged that the Dark Lord has returned and everyone is worried for their safety. At Hogwarts security has been tightened and there is a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and Potions teacher to deal with. Harry must also handle the relationship as he and his friends are growing up. <br /> <br />Harry learns more and more about Tom Riddle through private lessons with Dunbledore and the reader sees the plots thickening and converging. The books leaves the reader hanging with a shocking ending that leaves Harry's world upside down. <br /> <br />I found this installment of the series to be very good and gripping. Events that took place in the preceding five books are picked up in this story and with only one book remaining it will be interesting to see how Rowling completes this wonderful tale. <br /> <br />If you have been reading the Harry Potter series this book will not let you down.	2005-08-29

This is the fifth book in Rowling's seven part story about Harry Potter, the boy wizard. I was pleasantly surprised that the story keeps getting better and better. <br /> <br />As with the other books, this one starts out on Privet Drive. Harry has no choice but to spend his summers with the Dursley's who continue to treat him horribly. Harry is attacked while with the Dursley's and has to save his cousin Dudley. <br /> <br />Harry eventually gets back to Hogwarts. Unfortunately, the Ministry to Magic has infiltrated Hogwarts, and takes over. This turns Harry's magical world upside down. Friends turn on Harry, teachers are not safe, Hagrid is missing, and Harry is having strange dreams. <br /> <br />This book is very good. The trouble at Hogwarts keeps the reader guessing as far as what will happen next. There are a few slow parts, especially Harry romance with Cho. I didn't think that this plot theme was well developed, and at parts slowed the story down too much. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed to the book, and can not wait for the final two books. The stakes are rising and how will Voldemort be stopped and at what cost?	2005-04-06

During this time, some fo America's great poets and authors are living in the Boston area. Amongst them is Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. At this time Longfellow is in the midst of completing the first English translation of Dante's 'Divine Comedy', by an American. Included in tis effort is the Dante Club, which includes James Russel Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, J.T. Fields, and George Washington Greene. <br /> <br />As the Dante Club continues the translation, murders start to happen in Boston. The Dante Club slowly realizes that the murders are recreating the punishments in the different levels of Hell. The mystery unfolds as to who could be commiting the ghastly murders, and who would be knowledgable about Dante's Inferno. <br /> <br />The book is well crafted by Pearl. Period mysterious can be tricky if the books do not remain true to that period of time. It appears that Pearl has done his research on the Poets, and the atmoshpere of the late nineteenth century Boston. The spoken word between the Poets can get a little tedious, but not enough to distract from the story. <br /> <br />The mystery is well written. With multiple suspects and hidden agendas. I have to agree with some of the other reviews, this book has renewed my interest in rereading Dante, and some of the poets taking part in this tale. <br /> <br />Enjoy!	2005-03-07

The Duomo is an architectural and engineering marvel at a time when a dome of this size should not have been built. <br /> <br />The story chronicles the trials and efforts of Brunelleschi to design and build the Duomo in a way never before attempted. It was fascinating to learn that Brunelleschi not only design the dome, but also the means with which to build it. Brunelleschi had to design the cranes and hoists that were needed to build his structure. <br /> <br />At a time when the construction of buildings was dictated by the limitations of the materials and the methods, Brunelleschi rose above them and showed his comtemporaries (and today's experts) that some limits are really the ingenuity of man. <br /> <br />The Renaisance was a time when the boundaries of man's knowledge and creativity were expanded. It was a time when art, archtiecture, and engineering would flourish and grow. Brunelleschi was one of the first to bring architecture back into the realm of artwork. <br /> <br />I have not seen the Duomo in person, but after reading this book I have begun planning a trip to Florence. I highly recommend this book for the historian, the architects, the engineers, and the people who love the Renaisance. Even the reader with a passing interest, this book is a good read. <br />  <br />	2005-02-24

The skyscrapers are now beginning to appear in the cities of America, with Chicago leading the way. <br /> <br />After the Paris World's Fair, in which the Eiffel Tower was unveiled to the wonder of all, that the United States had to try and top the Frech fair. Several cities bid and lobby for the opportunity, with Chicago winning. Now the leading architects were banding together to design, build, and operate a world's fair that will ahve to outdo the French. <br /> <br />The story involves the complex and consistently difficult task of building a world class fair. Larsen takes throught the process of who and how the fair was conceived, dsigned, and built. The main character in this effort is Daniel Burnham, a leading architect in Chicago (Burnham would design several key architectural buildings, including the Flatiron building in NYC). The story takes us through the entire process including the running of the fair. It is a facinating account, bringing the conditions of the times into focus. I enjoyed the side stories involving the other architects. John Root (Burnham's partner), Louis Sullivan, and even mentions Frank Llyod Wright. The talent at this time is incredible! The fair galvanizes the entire city and capitvates the world. <br /> <br />THe parallel story line involves pure evil. Henry Mudgett (aka H.H. Holmes) is a chronic liar and thief. It isn't until he arrives in Chicago that his true evil is brought out. During this period of time, I believe more people are familiar with the story of Lizzie Broden and the death of her parents. I am surprised I never really heard anything regarding Holmes. Holmes appears to be the first serial killer in America. <br /> <br />Larsen is able to capture the pure evil of Holmes and how he was able to control women and men with his charisma. It is truely disturbing. <br /> <br />Larsen alternates each chapter between the events of the fair and Holmes. At times this can be a little tedious, but I quickly got used to how the tale jumped back and forth between all of the characters. <br /> <br />While I recommend this book, it is not for the faint of heart. Holmes is truely a monster of the late nineteenth century and for all time.	2005-02-16

It is delivered to us in the form of a graphic novel. This format is what one would find in a comic book. Don't let the format scare you away from reading it.<br /><br />The author also includes his troubled relationship with his father, and the brother who did not survive the war. Each book is well done, and the illustrations are moving. This is not a book from the young reader. However, it can deliver a good message to the teenagers much quicker and more to the point than some history books.<br /><br />I thought the subject was very hard to read at times, but it is well worth it. We get an insider's glimpse into the beginning of the war, the rounding up of the Jews in ghettos, the degrading conditions, the fear, the hiding, the hunger, and sadness. Our couple manage to stay together until they arrive in the main death camp.<br /><br />Read this story, and remember what had happened. We can not forget.	2005-02-05

This quest has consumed Paul since he entered Princeton. Paul meets the son of one of the researcher of the same book and strikes a friendship. The new friend is Tom, the main character of the book, who is telling the story.

The riddles, cryptography, and the hidden story within the book, at times to powerful a force to withstand. One thing seems to pull Tom back from being consumed by the book. <br /> <br />While this book has the same theme as some other recent hit novels, I found this book to be a little more enjoyable. The secret of the book, and the deciphering of the riddles and codes are good. I really enjoyed the characters in this novel. There was more depth to them, and the relationships were more intriquing. <br /> <br />Since I work in and around Princeton, I also enjoyed the locations described within the book. I recommend this book to all who enjoy a good mystery.	2005-02-05

The details described, not only of the volcanic eruption, but of way of life in that period of the Roman empire were great. <br /> <br />I have read a number of books regarding the Roman empire and all though I am not an expert, thought that part of the story was well researched and written. <br /> <br />However, I had more issues regarding the romantic interests of our hero. I didn't think this really added much to the story. I was intrigued by the disappearance and mystery surrounding the old aquarius. Unfortunately, the story lines regarding the new aquarius's wife and the romantic portions were not to my liking. This got to be a little tiresome and in my opinion not neccessary. <br /> <br />I did ienjoy the Pliny the Elder's character. This chracter comes more into play towards the end of the book. After finishing the story, I was left wanting more about Pliny. <br /> <br />All in all this book was still enjoyable to read, and I would recommend it to the fans of history, as well as those looking for some adventure around a volcanoe.	2005-01-31

There is a lot of time spent introducing the main characters of the battle and some of the events leading up to the battle. <br /> <br />The book somewhat focuses on the character of Joshua Chamberlain who leads a regiment from Maine into the battle. Shaara breaths life into all of the characters and handles details of the battle so well, that I did have trouble staying with the story. Some historical novels can get bogged down by details that a reader can loose interest. Shaara's treatment is wonderful and his characterizations allow you to enter the minds of Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, and Hancock. <br /> <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Civil War and/or Gettysburg.	2005-01-26

The rest of the group race to save Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by Sauruman's troops.<br /><br />This book races through events and follows the two groups as the story unfolds. Where will the fellowship find help? Can Gollum be trusted? We are introduced to the people of Rowhan, Gondor and the wonderful Ents. We witness the first great battles of the war (at Isengard and Helm's Deep). We can feel the tension increase as the hobbits get closer to their goal. However, the closer they get, the harder and harder the road becomes. It is similar to a wave cresting right before crashing into the rocks.<br /><br />This book continues the wonderous tale of the ring. Tolkien's life long work on Middle Earth comes to fruition in these books. Tolkien's focus on the details that back up the story and myths of Middle Earth reaps tremendous rewards to the reader.

Tolkien takes the world of Middle Earth that he developed and continues the tale of the ring. The ring first appears to us in 'The Hobbit'. The hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, keeps this special ring he found on his journey to help the dwarves. This book picks up the story decades after 'The Hobbit'.<br /><br />Bilbo has aged and in the course of celebrating his birthday leaves the Shire. To everyone's surprise Bilbo gives everything to his nephew Frodo, including the ring. Many years go by, and the wizard returns with a warning to take the ring and leave.<br /><br />Frodo and three friends begin the trip. Along the way the meet the Ranger who helps them get to Rivendell, home of the elves. At Rivendell the true identity of the ring is revealed and a course of action is decided upon. The ring must be destroyed.<br /><br />A band of nine people (men, elf, dwarf, wizard, and hobbits) form the Fellowship and begin the journey. This book sets the stage for the coming War of the Ring. We are introduced the members of the fellowship, gives us some background on Sauron, and the rings of power. We get a sense for the evil that the group is up against and the obstacles in their way. And soon realize that this journey is near impossible and may just be delaying the rise of Sauron.<br /><br />At times this book is hard to read. Tolkien goes into great detail regarding the history of Middle Earth and the characters involved in the story. This may hard for some readers to get through or keep track of. I, on the other hand, think these details add to the richness of the story. The story is wonderful and has much more detail than the recent movies. If you enjoyed 'The Hobbit' and/or the films, I would recommend reading the books to get the full story of the ring.	2005-01-26

They again split up as Gandalf and Pippin race to Minas Tirith. Aragorn is charging with gathering an army meet Sauron in battle.<br /><br />This book is divided into two parts. One focuses on Frodo and Sam's journey, the other on the rest of the fellowship. This makes keeping track of the chronology of the story a little difficult, but it avoids jumping back and forth between the various story lines.<br /><br />We follow the story, as the forces for good gather to face the evil Sauron. Aragorn steps out of his role as the ranger from the North and into the true king of Gondor. We watch the Steward of Gondor, Lord Denethor, slip into madness. We see Eowyn rise in battle. This part of the book rises to a fevered pitch culminating in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.<br /><br />The other half of the book follows the journey of Frodo and Sam. This section is harder to read. Frodo changes from the happy hobbit to a darker creature becoming more and more obsessed with the ring. However, as we see Frodo slipping away, Sam steps out of his humble past to carry Frodo towards Mount Doom.<br /><br />After the culmination of the War of the Ring, the book continues the story of the aftermath. We see that the scars of the journey have not gone away.<br /><br />Enjoy this final installment of the LOTR. It will leave you wanting more. Luckily their are several appendices that follow story lines Tolkien couldn't include in the books.	2005-01-26

Coach Bryant changes that and takes control of the team. To find out who are the real players on the team, Coach Bryant takes them to a training camp in Junction, Texas. A small hole in the wall hit hard by the drought in Texas. <br /> <br />The conditions are terrible. Extreme heat, a practice field with more stones and rocks than grass, and a coach driven to find a team amongst the 115 players that are taken to Junction. <br /> <br />What happens at Junction has now gone down as lengedary. Coach Bryant does everything to whip the players into a 'team'. After the ten days at camp are over, the single bus carries the remaining 35 players back to school.

I did not find all of Duff's thoughts on the people he met to be of much interest. <br /> <br />Duff's detailed descriptions of the trip, the climate, the terrain, and coastline were excellant.

Sobel, was published and became a best seller, there have been a number of books that have tried to follow the same lines. Some of these efforts have been successful. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that this book lived up to the task. <br /> <br />This story involves the quest for an accurate all encompassing unit of measure that can be agreed upon. During this period of time, the world does not have a standard unit of measure. Each town of province would have it's own standard for a unit of length, weight, and volume. Trade in that area would be based on this standard. This concept worked well until you left the area and tried to trade goods with a aneighboring town. <br /> <br />The neighboring town would have a different set of standards, which caused problems with setting unitary costs for goods. What a trader would pay per bushel of goods wouldn't mean very much when the size of the bushel changed from town to town. <br /> <br />The book goes into detail of the events regarding the determination of the standard meter. I enjoyed the race between the differnet countries, including the French trying to get the United States involved. Another interesting point was how the French Revolution played into the process. It was such a turbulent time and anyone hwo was part of the 'official' King's business were the enemy to the citizens. <br /> <br />The book gets a little long and drawn out regarding the measurements taken. It gets a little dry and, at times, difficult to keep ones interest. Not a bad book, but when compared to some of the better books, this one falls a little short.	2005-01-25

It is an amazing work where Tolkien develops the world of Middle Earth. From the creation, the first beings (the Ainuin), the rise of evil, the elves, the War of Wrath, the Fall of Numenor, and the Rings of Power. It covers the First Age, and the Second Age of Middle Earth. <br /> <br />It is amazing and wonderful to think that a writer, scholar took the time to develop the lore behind his stories. It set the standard for all writers to follow. <br /> <br />I first read this book after having read 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings'. I have since reread all of the books in chronological order enjoying them even more. <br /> <br />The Silmarillion is not for everyone. If you are not fan of Middle Earth, some of this book will be dry. It goes through a lot of history, and names that enrich the following stories, but could be tedious. However, I think that the book is well worth reading and helps define the later characters and the struggle they will face.	2005-01-25

I found this book to be very good and it is amazing that Rowling can keep the story as engaging.<br /><br />One comment I do have is that even though I enjoyed this book from front to back, my son and other young readers thought the beginning of the book was slow and found it harder to keep interested in the story. Stay with it the revalations are well worht it.	2005-01-21

After a rough summer with the Dursley's, Harry can not wait to get back to school. Unfortunately, strange things start to happen. Messages appearing on walls, students are being petrified, what is a young wizard to do?<br /><br />Rowling continues to amaze me as more and more of the secret world of magic and wizards is revealed in this book. It is fun to read about the day to day magic that happens in a wizard family's life. Getting a glimpse into the Weasley's home is great fun. I enjoyed Mr. Weasley's fastination with everything Muggle.<br /><br />We also learn a little more about 'He Who Must Not Be Named' and his quest to get back into power. The secindary characters that are introduced are very entertaining, especially the new Defense Against the Dark arts teacher.<br /><br />This is a great book for young readers. There is a lot of fantastical creatures, magic, people to enjoy. The suspense is rivetting, but not overly dark or graphic.	2005-01-21

The school is surrounded by Dementors who are trying to recapture the escapee. Harry also learns more about his past and the betrayal of his parents. <br /> <br />The plot thickens as Harry becomes more and more tired of the endless staring, the whispers behind his back, at being the center of attention. It is enough to drive a 13 year old mad. <br /> <br />We are introduced to a two new teachers, and we see Hagrid moving into a new position at the school. The bonds between Harry, Ron, and Hermione grow, and a foreboding premonition of the Dark Lord is told. <br /> <br />Rowling keeps the excitment rolling and does not let anyone down with this installment. It is very interesting watching Harry grow up and learn more and more about who he is and how he got to where he is. The story does get a little darker, but still should be fine for the younger readers.	2005-01-21

The story involves the sudden arrival of a wizard into the quiet village called the Shire. The wizard informs our hero, the hobbit - Bilbo Baggins, that he will be visited soon with a great task. Bilbo soon finds himself involved (not by his choice) in helping a band of dwarfs in an exciting tale of adventure and wonder.<br /><br />We follow Bilbo and the band of dwarfs as they make their way through many perilous areas. Fighting goblins, trolls, and wolves; captured by elves; and finding a dragon. All the makings of an endless tale. It is great to see how the chracter of Bilbo develops. Bilbo is reluctant at first to go on this adventure, but then realizes that one small hobbit can make a difference.<br /><br />This story introduces the reader to the world of Middle Earth. A world full of wonderful and amazing creatures and people. When I first read this story I was captivated by the intricate world that Tolkien had created. Little do we know that this story is the beginning of the end for the Third Age of Middle Earth.<br /><br />I know enjoy reading this story to my children and watching their eyes widen at various adventures encountered.	2005-01-20

What a wonderfully woven tale it is!<br /><br />The story begins with a young Harry Potter who lives a miserable life with his Aunt, Uncle, and cousin. Treated poorly and at times hated, things do not look good for Harry's future. That is until he receives an invitation to attend a school of witchcraft and wizardry. Harry is immediately exposed to a wonderous world that is hidden from ordinary people (muggles).<br /><br />The story gives the background of Harry as he learns more and more about his parents, including what happened to them. It also takes us through Harry's first year at his new school. During that year Harry has his first dealings with the evil side of the magical world.<br /><br />Rowling does a tremendous job in developing the world of Harry Potter and I really enjoyed the details. This book is written for the young reader, but I enjoyed reading it to my son.	2005-01-20
US	23164816	R2O4KO4DIBGOU4	0679419462	861735579	The Lost World	Books	1	0	3	N	N	A major flop	It was with great anticipation that I read this book. I have been a Crichton fan for a long time and think the 'Jurassic Park' was one of his best books. This book is the sequel and continues where the first book left off.<br /><br />To my knowledge, Crichton had never written a sequel to one of his books prior to this one. After the original novels success and the blockbuster movie based on the book, one can not help but think that Crichton felt some pressure (from Hollywood, fans, and the big payday - who knows) to continue the story.<br /><br />Well, this book falls far short of the original. This book seems to follow the same script as the first book, but the characters are changed a little. It just isn't very creative regarding the characters, the premise of the story and without those it has nothing. I actually got the feeling when reading this book that some of it was written with movie scenes in mind.<br /><br />My advice would be to read the original and skip this book all together. You will not be missing much.	2005-01-20
US	23164816	R1O9MPEB95PUN9	0345459407	981903971	Perdido Street Station	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Unbound imagination	The story takes us to a city, unlike any that has been dreamt of. It is a city full of strange creatures (insect-like, slug-like, bird-like, etc). In addition there are the beings that are 'remade'. Surgically enhanced or tortured creations modifed at times for a specific task or just for someone's pleasure. The story touches on a number of story threads, which all focus on the slake moths. These creatures have been released onto the city and have to be stopped. <br /> <br />I found this book to be very strange. It takes Mieville a long time to develope the story, the characters, the city, etc. It is, at times, tough to get through this first third of the book, but it is worth the effort. Once you've gotten through this strange city, it residents, and the terror that must be stopped, the story begins to pick up speed. It is like a run away ride. You want to stay with it for the thrills and to see where the ride ends. <br /> <br />I think the book is good, but a little overdone regarding the book's language. I enjoyed it and the strange world that was created.	2005-01-19

With such books as 'Jurassic Park', 'The Andromeda Strain', and 'Disclosure' it makes it difficult to always hit a home run. <br /> <br />This book takes on the dangers of dealing with nano-technology. Crichton is such a good writer that he grab the reader and keep them captivated sometimes in spite of the subject. I think that is a great skill and still enjoyed the book. <br /> <br />The story did lose me a little regarding the mass of nanobots and their life like abilities. It is hard to believe some of the books imagery. This may be partly due to the limited knowledge regarding nano-technology. <br /> <br />If you a Crichton fan or some looking for an enjoyable easy read, then this book is good. However, if you're looking for Crichton's next great novel, I didn't think this book stood up with the rest.	2005-01-19

I didn't know much about this book and its story line. I was completely captivated by the story and Lyra. I really enjoyed the mixing of magic, theology, and science, as well as the daemons. <br /> <br />Pullman's imagination develops a great world, that the young and old will enjoy to read. The story introduces us to Lyra and an Oxford that differs from our own. The people of this world all have a daemon that is connected to the individual's soul. The mystery unfolds as we find that children are disappearing. When Lyra's friend disappears then Lyra starts the search for him and why the children are being taken. The search take the reader to the North Pole and we meet a number of different people and characters along the way. <br /> <br />I haven't read the remaining two books in the trilogy, but they won't be far behind. Enjoy this book and world that is created. Younger children will also be captivated by the story.	2005-01-19

The story involves a wealthy philanthropist who supports environmental causes. The philanthropist suddenly starts acting strangely and is killed. The mystery begins...and we are quickly racing all over the globe. The story is fast paced. The book is full of references to articles, papers, and reports that contradict the general public knowledge regarding environmentals crises. It raises a number of questions to the conventional beliefs and warrants some investigation into the articles cited. Some of the story goes a little over the top, and is surprisingly timely regarding world events. Definitely a book worth reading. Enjoy!	2005-01-18

It included information on the early years of Washington's career, and was very readable. It was interesting to learn about Wahington's background and his obsession with how he would be remembered in history. If you are looking for great details into Washington's life and career, this book may not satisfy your needs. However, for a concise account of his life before and after the war and his presidecnies I thought this book captured things very well. I would recommend it to all those with a casual and serious historical interest in Washington.	2005-01-18

The book takes us into the world of Cayce Pollard, an advertising consultant, with the ability to judge an ad campaign or logo and determine if it will be successful. Pollard also has a strange phobia for certain product logos.<br />The plot involves a fastination with the 'footage'. Small film clips which are being released on the internet by an unknown person(s). Pollard is enlisted to find the creator of the footage. This hunt takes her from London, to Japan, and finally to Russia.<br />I found this book a bit of a struggle. The text rambled, at times, going no where. Some of the plot lines that were introduced were abandonded by the end of the book, leaving open ended questions. This was my first book by Gibson. If you haven't read any of Gibson's other works, I would not recommend starting with 'Pattern Recognition'.	2004-06-14

'The Andromeda Strain' involves a new deadly disease that has been brought back to earth, by a military/science sattelite. A space rpogram has been designed to enter space and bring back samples in the hopes of finding a new bacterial weapon. The book describes a secret government base where such diseases can be contained and researched.<br />Well, the program is a success. A deadly germ is brought back to Earth, and proceeds to wipe out a remote town. The germ is isolated in the governmetn facility, and the race is on to find how this entity reactes with the human body and how it can be cured or neutralized.<br />The book is a little dated, but none the less a great plot. I remember seeing the movie when I was young and loving it. I finally found the time to read the book. It is one of Critchon's early works, but stil very good.<br />If you are a Critchon fan (or not) I would recommend this book. It is quick paced and good for those days beside the pool or at the beach.	2004-06-14
US	23164816	RD66SG4JQWCDP	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A great summer read.	'Angels &amp; Demons' intorduces us to Robert Langdon, a professor of symbology. Langdon is quickly thrown into a mystery that involves a long 'dead' secret society and the Catholic church. Langdon is quickly whisked off to Sweden, and then Rome. Langdon must try to solve the mystery of this secret society, find a bomb set to destroy Vatican City, and win the girl all inn 24 hours.<br />This book is a page turner. Once you get into the story I found it very hard to put down. The chapters are typically short, which seems to keep the plot moving. I didn't mind this, but have heard comments that it may annoy some readers.<br />I found the race through Rome wonderful, and was constantly refering to my art history books to look up the art and architecture that is referenced throughout. This book doesn't take a lot of effort to read and I highly recommend it as a great summer read. That is unless you have a vacation planned with a lot of activities and site seeing.	2004-06-14

I thought Menzies brought a fresh prospective on the times and navigation during that period of history.<br />Menzies provides a great amount of information on the great Chinese treasure fleets, and their adventures. I found the process that the Chinese used to establish longitude incredible. Having read Sobel's book 'Longitude' made this even more fascinating.<br />However, as I got further into the book, I startted to get the feeling that Menzies was stretching the facts too much in favor of the Chinese. I think that there should have been opposing viewpoints included in the discussion.<br />This book was very interesting and will eventually lead me to read further into this period of time both from the European and the Chinese histories.	2004-02-24
US	23164816	RTVZDABRWZAK3	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Entertaining	I have read a number of Crichton books, from his early novels to the most recent. After a string of books that I thought were dissappointing and actering more to Hollywood, 'Timeline' was better. Crichton's explaination of the history, the locations, and the peroid were great. The plot was fast paced and once I was hooked the book was hard to put down.<br />The science behind time travel was a little weak. Having read books on quantum physics (I am far from knowledgable)I understood Crichton's concept of alternative universes. However, I couldn't buy Crichton's handling of the time travel paradox and if the characters were in the past.<br />These are minor points. They raised some questions for me, but the story was non the less very good. Even though a movie has been made of this book I didn't get the feeling that the plot was laid out for a script.<br />Enjoy!	2004-01-05

This book took off with and bang and the sprinter's pace continued throughout this marathon race to find the Holy Grail.<br />The book begins in Paris, France with a murder. On the surface, the clues from the murder point to the hero, a Harvard professor, and before he knows what is happening he and the heroine are on the run from the police. The story takes the reader from Paris, to London, to Scotland, and back to Paris in a breakneck pace. The main characters must solve the riddles and codes left for them, while avoiding the authorities and the people behind the murder.<br />I enjoyed this book alot. I had heard and read of a number of the points (Dead Sea Scrolls and DaVinci's artwork) and enjoyed Brown's weaving them into a very exciting story. The codes and clues to solve for the location of the Grail were clever, and added to the suspense of this thriller.<br />The information that Brown gives the reader will cause some to rethink what they've known. At a minimum it should cause the reader to look up more information on the subjects.<br />A very good and enjoyable read.	2004-01-05

The book goes into some background about Fleming, which I found very interesting. The point incident that leads Fleming into developing and advocating a Standard Time is also very good. Unfortunately, Blaise loses me by changing the topic to the impact that the railroads had on the Victorian lifestyle, and his pages regarding Sherlock Holmes. I was hoping for more insight into the Prime Meridian conferences, but it didin't happen. I thought Hochschild's 'King Leopold's Ghost' a much better historical book.	2003-12-16

It should be noted that Baudolino is a great story teller and a known liar. As Eco ties in many historical and fantasy figures into Baudolino's life the reader is never sure what is the truth and what is not. As a whole the story was great. Having never read one of Eco's books before I was not sure what I was getting into. I found parts of the story a struggle to get through. However, the book was worth sticking to and the ending was very good. If you are a fan of Eco's books you will enjoy this story. If you have never read one of Eco's book I do not think I would recommend this as a first taste.	2003-12-11

While I have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding the writing style and the portions of the story which are influenced from some very geat Authors. Even though Paolini has taken plot lines from other Authors I will wait to see where these stories end up. I don't want to trash his first effort completely and look forward to seeing what the next volume has in store. Hopefully, the editing issues can be resolved by then.	2003-12-11

Unfortunately, the book never delivered on what I thought was a very interesting subject.<br />During an age when the different parts of the world followed their own clocks, it made me realized how confusing and disconnected the world was. I was fascinated to learn how the railroads became the time keepers, but disappointed as the Author seemed to spend more time discussing the impact of the railroad rather than delivering more on Fleming and/or standard time.<br />I had hoped to get a good understanding of Sandford Fleming, his contempararies, and the Prime Meridian Conference. There were parts of this book that where an effort to get through. All in all, I found this book not delivering on the subject. Books that I thought did a better job on regarding historical events were:<br />Longitude - Dava Sobel<BR>King Leopold's Ghost - A. Hochschild	2003-12-08
