I see other readers did not like Mitch Rapp girlfriend in the book, neither did I, but it is a minor point and it is not bad enough to hurt it all that badly. I liked the parts in Washington D.C with Congressmen Rudin and Senator Clark the most but the parts involving Iraq was great to. If you like political or action books then this is the book for you. Also as I said before this is the first book I have read of his, so if you want to read this book and you have not read any others in the series you will still be able to enjoy this book for what is worth. You will be able to understand what is happening in this book if you have not  read any of the past books in the series.	2004-06-14

I really liked the lsd suicide section that was talked about in the end of the book, I  also  liked when they talked about 9/11 theories (nice to see them condemn the theories), also I liked how they talked about the voting issue in the 2000 election. overall a great book for conspiracy buffs. the only thing wrong with it was the references to the show \\"The X Files,\\" the show been cancelled for a long time lose the references, also they talked about the alien autopsy, although the said that is probably fake it has been recently proven fake, lose the chapter. Also I would like it if they updated more sections of the book. In the end this is a great book to read if you like reading this sort of thing.	2004-05-28
