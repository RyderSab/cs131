It tells the story of Mina, the daughter of the Queen of Night (Pamina) and the Mage of the Day (Sarastro).  Mina has lived with her mother for almost sixteen years, but, on the day before she was supposed to be returned to her father so he could choose her husband, he steals her away ahead of schedule.  He wants to force her to wed the man of his choosing, when all she wants to do is follow her heart.<br />The story swtiches viewpoint sometimes by chapter and sometimes by paragraph.  Cameron Dokey does a good job of giving the characters distinct voices, so that I only got confused about the point of view once.  The POV switches between:<br />Mina: The daughter who wants the freedom to choose her husband, and to stay with him once she has done so, <BR>Lapin: Mina's best friend and the Queen of Night's faithful servant,<BR>Tern: the prince who follows Lapin's bells to his true love and faces trials to win her, <BR>Statos: Sarastro's right hand man and Mina's intended husband, and<BR>Gayna: the orphan girl that Sarastro raised as his own daughter and who now has to face the fact that she will always be second in his affections.<br />Dokey weaves an enchanting spell around the reader.  Her writing is as engaging as always, sometimes tongue-in-cheek funny, sometimes serious, always magical.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves fairy tales.  The only fault I can find with it, is that it is too short, and I think a few things are rushed.  Still, it's a must-read book.	2004-07-03

Shadow Hawk, a Seneca chief, is appalled by his fellow warriors, who go to the saloon most every night to get 'firewater.'  He wants to run Shawndee and her mother out of town, as do the rest of the town's 'respectable' citizens.  Shadow Hawk thinks that if he kidnaps Shawndee, or 'Andrew' as she is called, he will run the old woman out of town.  <br />Or something like that.  I didn't get past the first few chapters because the writing is atrocious.  The dialogue is unbelievable.  They all talk with an excessive amount of ellipses that are supposed to convey hesitant speech, but are just annoying.  Shawndee and Shadow Hawk fall in love almost instantly.  It is as if Ms. Edwards is just feeding the reader the story instead of letting it flow on its own.  I tried another of her books, SAVAGE DESTINY, and again I couldn't get past the first chapter it was so bad.  I don't see how this book could have gotten the reviews it did.  I might try Ms. Edwards one more time, though not another Savage Etc. book, but only once more and only because I like the whole Native American/white romance sub-genre.  Please, don't waste your money on this one.	2004-06-23

Kati and Egan have always been at odds, but Kati resolves to try and be nice for her friend's sake.  See, Kati is a romance novelist, therefore Egan automatically assumes that she is promsicuous and gets inspiration for her novels from her life.  The two cannot deny their attraction to each other, so Egan invites Kati to his ranch so she can do research for her new book.  Sparks fly even more, Egan learns how wrong he was, and the happy ending is wrapped up in a nice, neat, *fast* little package.<br />This story is packed with strong emotions and clashing personalities.  Too bad Egan is so offensive that there is no way I could possibly like him.  The comments he makes to Kati, calling her a [prostitute] and insinuating horrible things, are indefensible.  Kati barely sticks up herself.  It is also completely irrational that Egan assumes what he does about Kati.  So irrational, it borders on absurd. <br />This is my first Palmer, and, while I don't like the book, I plan on reading more of her stuff because she writes well and knows how to elicit emotion from her reader.	2004-06-19

Ms. Robbins followed four girls (I'm not quite sure how she hid her presence; that isn't made very clear in the book)from two different sororities for about a year.  She followed Sabrina (Alpha Rho), a poor black girl in a mostly white sorority, Amy (Alpha Rho)who'd just lost her twin sister and was looking for another form of sisterhood, and had been date-raped, Caitlin (Alpha Rho) who suffers from a controlling mother and was also date-raped, and Vicki (Beta Pi) who misses her friends back home desperately and is intimidated by her sisters.   She claims she chose them from average sororities- she avoided sororities known for their wildness or their properness- and that the girls' conversations are their own.  If this is all true, how could what she wrote be stereotypical?  If she experienced it first hand, then I don't see why the book would be anything but accurate.  Robbins intersperses anecdotes of sorority life with her own analysis and examples from other sororities across the country.  She also talks about historically black sororities and how they are known to put much more emphasis on community service than historically white sororities.     While I'll admit that the book does read a bit like a tabloid and that I think it is wrong for Ms. Robbins to have revealed the sororities' secret rituals (as inane as I think they are), I don't think she portrayed sorority life all that erroneously.  At least, I don't think she made up what she wrote.  Maybe she just got lucky and picked bad sororities.  My friends in college say they aren't anything like this, though.  All in all, the book makes for fun reading.	2004-06-18

After a few shaky experiences, she finds a good apartment and a seemingly great new job.  When a designer steals her ideas, she starts work at a lingerie store and discovers she has a talent for designing sexy, but not-too-revealing nighties.  Throw an ultra-conservative father, a pregnant best friend, and a sexy across-the-hall neighbor into the mix, and you have what should be a promising romantic comedy.<br />Sadly, the book falls decidedly short of expectations.  Everything about the book, from the characters' dialogue to their personalities to the situations, seems false.  Seriously, could you imagine a tough guy from the Bronx *squealing* over two scoops of chocolate sorbet?  Also, how could an 18-year-old with no proper training expect to just show up in New York and get a high-end job?  The relationship Sami had with her father is not very well developed.  Her aversion to her small-town life seems forced, almost as if it was put in there as an after-thought.  Everything in the book is superficial.  And, of course, it's all wrapped up in a nice little package, moral and all, in the last couple of pages.  <br />If you need something to pass the time, this book is as good as any.  Borrow it from a friend or buy it at a used bookstore, though.  Don't waste too much money on it.  It's very much not worth it.	2004-06-06
US	49704674	R2W0NP2BYLTR8	0345416880	281816523	Enchantment	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Enchantment	_Enchantment_ is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty with a Russian twist.  When he is little and still living in Russia, Ivan is drawn to a certain spot in the woods near his cousin's house.  This gives him his first sighting of the princess.  Years later, while researching for his dissertation on, what else, fairy tales, he returns to the spot, frees the princess and is transported back 1100 years.  He and Katerina, the princess, eventually head back to present day, then once more to the ninth century to defeat the evil Baba Yaga.<br />This was my first Card book and I love it.  Retold fairy tales are a particular favorite of mine, and this one did not disappoint.  Baba Yaga is truly evil and the little interludes from her point of view are monstrous fun.  Her relationship with Bear is comical and engaging.  I absolutely fell in love with Ivan.  He is caring and sensitive to others' needs.  He's not a pushover, really, he just doesn't like to hurt people. His consideration for Katerina is heroic and achingly sweet when you see how she treats him.  When it is called for, though, he stands up for himself.  Katerina is less likeable.  She treats Ivan with barely concealed contempt because he has trouble living in her world and living up to her idea of manhood.  Still, that is to be expected considering that she is a princess and the ninth century is very different from today.  Ivan and Katerina's journey into love is believable and incredibly romantic.  All of the secondary characters are very well-fleshed out.  The story is captivating and rarely slow.  I recommend this to anyone who loves a good fairy tale, romance, or adventure.	2004-01-11

In all the previous St. John novels, Hawkins hinted that something was wrong with this beloved brother and I was mightily intrigued.  But the story just didn't deliver.  Chase is being blackmailed by a man he once considered a friend and is forced to flee England so as not to tarnish the St. John name.  Along the way he has an accident and is taken in by the Ward family where he pretends to have amnesia so word will not get round that he is there.  He supposedly carries an incredible guilt with him over something that happened awhile ago when he was drunk, but you would not know it by his demeanor.  He professes that it plagues him, but his actions do not show it.  The whole thing seems rather contrived.  Still, the Ward family is likeable and Hary Annesly is a dastardly villain indeed.  An enjoyable read if a bit of a letdown.	2003-12-27
US	49704674	R22Y85B0YH07A4	0425191788	301916690	Sunshine	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Sunshine	Set in a futuristic Earth, 'Sunshine' tells the story of a young woman whose life drastically changes after she is captured by a group of vampires.  She is locked up with a starving vampire, Con, and they become tentative allies in a war against the group of vampires that captured her and their evil leader.  <br />As plots go, the book is okay. It's full of twists and turns and leaves enough open for a sequel to be reasonable.  The characters are somewhat less than endearing.  Sunshine's voice is annoying because she keeps going off on tangents about one thing or another and you rather wish she would shut up and get on with the story.  Her family and boyfriend are not utilized enough.  I like Con.  He is mysteriously sexy.  There is a character nick-named 'the goddess of pain' and she's interesting, but McKinley doesn't really go anywhere with her.<br />The style of this book is very different from McKinley's others.  The world she creates (future-Earth where magic and demons are everywhere) is not as captivating as Damar or the Beast's castle or Foggy Bottom.  It feels contrived and all of the references she makes to books, etc.  that are exclusive to that world are hard to follow.  <br />I usually like McKinley's prose, all lush and lyrical, but it falls flat here.  Oh, she can make a scene creepy, but the emotions never really come across.  Everything is low-key and I don't get a sense of anxiety or fear or anything.  In the one, I guess it was sort of a sex scene, McKinley shocks you from your stupor with unnecessarily crude language.  If she'd been using it throughout the book, it would have been okay, but since she didn't, it's jarring.<br />If you're a McKinley, fan, you should check this out just for loyalty's sake.  If you've never read her before, start with \\"Beauty\\" and don't waste your money on this.	2003-10-04

They face obstacles such as his guilt and an old enemy back for revenge. <br />My first Julia Quinn book was The Duke and I, which is part of the Bridgerton series.  It is a wonderful, well-written book and I was expecting this one to be the same.  Sadly, it fell decidedly short of my expectations.  Grammatically it was fine, but plotwise it was a bit thin and forced.  Some of the things the characters do and say are absurd and just silly.  Fortunately, this was written years before the Bridgerton series and Julia Quinn's writing has dramatically improved.  If you want to read a Quinn book, start with The Duke and I.<br />Still, if you don't expect too much, this is a fairly entertaining book and if you're desperate for something to read, try this.	2003-09-04

Madelyne wins over Duncan's whole family, who initially hate and distrust her, and finally wins over Duncan.  After a hasty marriage to Madelyn, Duncan works his hardest to keep Louddon from stealing her back.  The characters were good, but I didn't really like Madelyne all that much.  Her idiosyncrasies, which I suppose Garwood meant to be endearing, were just a little bit annoying.  But, it was still a good book and I highly recommend it.	2002-09-19

I think a reader quoted on the back cover said it best: \\"Frolicking Rollicking fun\\"<br />That's exactly what this book is with a few sad, poignant moments mixed in.  I think Austen would be positively scandalised if she read this.  It's so good and raunchy (not in a bad way, in a very very good way and not at all crude) and sweet and Berdoll just makes the emotions come to life.  You can actually feel the love that Darcy and Elizabeth hold for each other.  You can feel when they are heartbroken or excited or scared.  Berdoll is a beautiful, talented writer.  Reading the other reviews, I see that other people noticed the bad editing and I wasn't totally crazy.  I think I've read this book (at least the really good parts) more than I've ever read anything else and that's saying something.  The only thing I could wish for now is a book by Berdoll showing Darcy's point of view during Pride and Predjudice (the Diary of Henry Fitzwilliam Darcy is just unsatisfying).	2002-06-11

The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the bedroom scenes, they were not racy or explicit or anything, they were beautiful and passionate and did NOT go into gritty details.  Darcy just does not sound like Darcy in this book, though.  He is way too unregal (is that a word?)  and the dialogue makes me think of Shakespeare (methinks and all).  It is very interesting to get Darcy's point of view in the parts that are also in P&amp;P. I reread P&amp;P after I read this book and was like &quot;Okay, Darcy is thinking this while he's saying this&quot; and that was very cool.  Quick question, though, in this book when Darcy sees Lizzy at Pemberley taking the tour, he has just taken a swim and she sees him all wet and when she is at Netherfield taking care of Jane, Darcy sees her playing with a dog. Well, this also happens in the movie (A&amp;E version) and I was just wondering was this in the book?? I've cheked and checked and I can't find it but maybe I'm missing something.  Oh well, back to the book, there were a few discrepencies in it (Charlotte's sister is Maria, not Marie and Caroline Bingley did not ask about Wickham specifically, just the ---shire Militia, she knew enough about Darcy and Wickham to stay away from his name)  But, it was a good book and I suggest any P&amp;P fan read it.	2001-12-27

The only fault that I found in it was that it was way too short.  The ending came rather abruptly and unexpectedly but it was still extremely good and romantic.  HURRICANE is a story about Madelaine LeBlanc, a plantation owner's daughter, who falls in love with Francoise, a Cajun hired hand who comes to work on the LeBlanc plantation after hurricanes ravage it.  The disaster is downplayed a little too much. The love scenes are phenomenal and Ms. Duey did a splendid job with the dialogue between Phillipe and Francoise.

It's a fact of life. You can't change it. Get over it.

The disaster is rather downplayed and the ending comes very quickly. Ms. Duey would be a phenomenal writer if she just wrote longer books.  In EARTHQUAKE, as in HURRICANE, the ending comes so quickly without any prelude to it. It's almost as if Ms. Duey was trying to hurry the ending along.

Rilla is a fourteen year old, vain, carefree girl without any ambitions but to have fun and have many beaux when she is thrown into the relentless Hell known as War.  It's a story of loss and love and growth. It's incredibly romantic.  It's sad but the sad thing that happens is for the best (I see that now even though I tried to fight it for so long).  In my opinion, out of all the L.M. Montgomery books that I've read, Rilla is the only main character with any sense when it comes to who she loves and knowing, at least having an inkling, that they love her back.  It's a wonderful story that everyone should read. Even my friend who hates Montgomery books loved it.	2001-10-17

This book is a comedy making fun of the English society in the early 1800s.  It's making the womens'(woman's?) quest for a good future into a vicious man-hunt and it's hilarious.

She is befriended by the village priest and a deaf boy who everyone thinks is mad. It's a love story, if anyone wants to know. It's hard for me to read abook without one.  But, though there is romance in it, there's compassionate love and understanding love.  The witch trial and the low-tolerance level of the villagers is appalling and sadly all too true of that time period and this one if you think about it.

In this book, Teddy and Ilse go to Europe to study, Perry is renowned (is that how you spell that) for his political abilities and Emily writes a book.  It's a great book and well worth reading.	2001-08-05

It's basically like Ms. McKinley wrote Beauty over again, changing a few things, and making it worse...  The ending is kinda weird and a little gross when you think about it.  But, if you are willing to struggle through it, it's a good book.	2001-08-05
US	49704674	RD3HJUTTKQKPH	014131110X	540825738	Spinners	Books	2	1	1	N	N	not so hot	I'm crazy about retold fairy tales but this one just falls a little short.  For one thing, no real love story.  For another, it was sorta depressing.  I don't really like the tale of Rumpelstiltskin very much anyway (I always felt a little bit sorry for him (a very little bit)) but it has always held some sort of magic for me just like all the other fairy tales.  This version of it just sucked the magic right out.  It's not exactly dark but it's not light either. It just falls somewhere in the middle, like it was hanging in Limbo or something. I don't recommend reading it.	2001-07-30
US	49704674	RX92SQO568QYP	0553280511	804782425	The Blue Castle	Books	5	3	3	N	N	a must read	I have read a lot of L.M. Montgomery books including the Anne and Emily novels, the Pat books, and Kilmeny of the Orchard.  In my opinion, Valancy, Rilla, and Kilmeny (to an extent) are the only ones with sense.  Don't get me wrong, I adore Anne and Emily and Pat, but it just took them so darned long to get with their significant others that I just get fed up sometimes.  I mean, Anne and Pat don't know their own minds and Emily is proud and misled (don't misunderstand I love them to death it's just , you know).  In this book, after years of being opressed and unappreciated by her family, Valancy learns some startling news about herself. She decides that she is not going to care what her family says and follows her own heart.  The big love story scene in this book is probably my favorite out of them all (partly because it lasts for a bit), although Rilla and Anne's are up there.    This is a great book that L.M. Montgomery fans and just plain romance fans will cherish.	2001-07-30

This is the tale of the humbling of Gawain, a legendary knight of the Round Table.  It is told through the eyes of Gawain's squire, Terence.  Gawain and Terence set out in search of the Green Knight.  Along the way, they go on all sorts of adventures including a trip to the Otherworld.  They rescue a pretty maiden named Eileen and fight evil boars!  Gerald Morris is a superb writer making the book by turns funny and touching.  I recommend this to everyone.	2001-07-30

Cinderellis was a sweet, light version of Cinderella that was funny and touching at the same time.  Cinderellis is a clever inventor who is ignored by his two brothers.  Marigold is a princess whose father is always off on quests for one thing or another. When it is time for Marigold to marry, though, her father is prevented from going on a quest for the perfect husband. So, he contructs a very slippery glass hill that Marigold will sit on.  The man who can climb the hill will be Marigold's bride.  The romantic parts are sweet and innocent and hilariously funny at the same time. Levine does a marvelous job of weaving humor into fairy tales.	2001-07-30

It chronicles her ascent from child to woman in a time of horror and despair.  The relationships between the characters are good, especially between Jem and her enigmatic tutor, John.  The characters are well fleshed out and the plot is paced nicely.  In my opinion, this is Rinaldi at her best.	2001-01-26
