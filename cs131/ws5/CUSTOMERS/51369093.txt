US	51369093	R1KYK3OCP4R1PP	0374299625	440745925	Specimen Days	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Strange Book	I really like Cunningham, and I had high expectations for this book. Saying that, I was disappointed, although I found this a quick read.<br /><br />Brief summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />This novel is divided up into three distinct sections. All are roughly 100 pages long, and all take place in Manhattan/New York.<br /><br />The first part takes place in the 1800s, during the industrial revolution, where a young, boy with an odd shaped head named Lucas gets a job at a factory, after his beloved brother is killed by one of the machines.<br /><br />In this part of the novel, we see how horrible life was for the poor, including the many factory workers and seamstresses. They had to work long hours in terrible conditions.<br /><br />The second story takes place in modern New York, and it follows a woman named Cat who works for the police department, intercepting phone calls from would be terrorists and bombers. Cat meets a boy that has the same odd face as Lucas in the first section, and the story of her relationship with that boy becomes the focus of this part of the novel.<br /><br />The last part takes place 150 years from now, and it involves semi-artificial humans and lizard like aliens.<br /><br />So we go from gothic ghost story, to modern day police tale, finally to one of science fiction.<br /><br />The three parts are all interlinking (slightly), and they contain similar themes and characters. Pay attention, because certain artifacts and descriptions appear in all of the stories.<br /><br />Overall, this made for a strange reading experience. It would make for an interesting discussion for your book club.	2005-06-22

I normally finish one book, and pick up another right away, but right now I just want to sit and think about THIS book.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />80 year old historian Robert MacIver is dying. He is at his old house on the Cape, and he has made a list of \\"rules\\" to follow these last weeks of his life. These rules involve such things as maintaining his personal hygiene, and eating a healthy diet. Rule seven is \\"Work every morning. Nap in afternoon if needed. The companion to this rule is, \\"Work to consist of telling a story to the end, not just shards, but the whole pot\\".<br /><br />Robert begins to write a story, his last story,  about a group of soldiers in W.W.I. As he is writing this tale, he reminisces about his life.<br /><br />In doing so, we meet his beloved wife Margaret, and his son David. And we are taken through 3 wars, W.W.I, W.W.II (where Robert served), and the Vietnam War.<br /><br />This is a devastating novel.<br /><br />Although this is a short book (just barely over 200 pages), it is very dense, and it is not a quick read. Perhaps there might even be too much description, as I found myself tempted to skim at times.<br /><br />Despite any minor quibbles, I found this a wonderful story, with a terrific beginning, AND end. In fact the last page (the last sentence!) left me reeling.<br /><br />Highly recommended. This book would be an EXCELLENT choice for your book club.	2005-06-06
US	51369093	R2P64VC73DKIWS	0316830348	190026728	Misfortune	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Modern day Dickens novel	Misfortune tells the tale of someone leading a dual life. The title of this entertaining novel has a double meaning too...think \\"Miss Fortune\\".<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers (which is VERY hard to do in a novel like this.)<br /><br />This story, which takes place in the early 19th century, is about a babe dramatically rescued from certain death. This child, who is named Rose, is raised as a proper English girl.<br /><br />The problem is that \\"Rose\\" is a boy.<br /><br />The plot thickens. Enter eccentric lords, greedy relatives, throw in some sexual content and a storyline that takes us to exotic lands, and you have an idea of the scope and fun of Misfortune.<br /><br />In true Dickens fashion, evil-doers are punished, coincidences abound, and you are led on a mad adventure in the process.<br /><br />This book is recommended. I do think it might have been shortened, as there were times when I thought the book a bit tedious....but I still think it's a fun read.	2005-06-01

If you like Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine, I am pretty sure you will like this book.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />Lucy Fly is a 34 year old Englishwoman living in Toyko. She works there as a translator.<br /><br />At the very beginning of the novel, Lucy is picked up by the Toyko police for questioning in the murder of her friend, Lily Bridges.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of Lucy, as she backtracks to tell us the story of her upbringing in rural England, and the reasons she now lives and works in Toyko. As Lucy narrates, we are first introduced to her boyfriend, Teiji, and then to Lily, a young Englishwoman who has reasons of her own for her recent move to Toyko.<br /><br />To say that Lucy is strange is to make a great understatement...and when Lucy starts referring to herself in third person you know something very weird is going on...<br /><br />Highly recommended. Not only is this a good psychological mystery, this novel also gives you some insights on what it's like living in Japan.	2005-05-22

It's the latest installment in the series about John Dortmunder, who's misadventures in crime never cease to amuse.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />Arnie Albright is New York fence who comes up with the plan for the perfect crime. While  at a Club Med, he meets  billionaire and jerk extraordinaire, Preston Fareweather. He is mistreated by Fareweather (who isn't?), and decides to get revenge.<br /><br />Fareweather is hiding out from process servers who are trying to contact him at the behest of four angry ex-wives.

It's funny and satisfying, and you are left with a big smile on your face when you finish the last page. Westlake at his best.	2005-05-13
US	51369093	R3SAB12TDTIT5O	1573222984	401018820	The Portrait	Books	4	33	34	N	N	Recommended, with reservations	This short novel is by one of my favorite writers, Iain Pears. His novel, An Instance of the Fingerpost, goes down as one of my favorite all time reads.<br /><br />His newest novel, The Portrait,  is well written, and intriguing. Saying that, it has its problems.<br /><br />Summary, no spoiler:<br /><br />This story is told entirely by the narration of a painter named Henry MacAlpine. Henry now lives in isolation on an island off the coast of France, and has agreed  paint a portrait of his old friend and nemesis, William Nasmyth, a famous art critic. The story takes place over a series of days in the year 1913.<br /><br />As Henry paints this portrait, he reminisces about his relationship with William, and the book is told entirely in the form of a monologue from Henry.<br /><br />The book is filled with a sense of menace, as Henry recalls past events and relationships, and it becomes clear that Something Bad might happen.<br /><br />The story is well told, but because of its form, this monologue, I found it a rather slow read, and had to put it down at times lest it become tedious.<br /><br />In the hands of most other authors, this book would've lost steam early on....but Pears is such an adept writer that he manages to keep you hooked.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and yes, the ending is a goody.	2005-05-01
US	51369093	R3VL81LUX29OCQ	1400042267	59870239	Lost in the Forest	Books	5	44	54	N	N	Recommended with reservations..	IMHO, this is one of Miller's better books. The characters are all ring true, and the tale is told in an interesting way.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />Eva and Mark had two children, named Emily and Daisy. When the girls were small, Mark has an affair, and the marriage ends.<br /><br />Eva remarries John (\\"a nice guy\\"), and has a son, Theo, with him.<br /><br />When the book opens, we discover that John has been killed in a car accident (he was a pedestrian), and everyone is feeling enormous grief.<br /><br />The book tells the story of that grief, and how each character deals with life without John.<br /><br />Mark now becomes a more vital part of the family's life, Eva deals with loneliness, and Daisy, 14 years old and the most troubled, deals with her grief, her alienation from other kids, and her burgeoning sexuality.<br /><br />This is a quick read. As usual, Miller is entertaining, and in particular, in this novel she has created a realistic group of characters.<br /><br />The only reservation I have is with the ending of this book. Miller's last chapter takes place well after the events of the book, and it does resolve a lot of questions as to what happens to the various characters. It is just my opinion, but I would have preferred a different ending.  It was a bit of a letdown for me, and I felt like I was meeting different characters than the ones I had come to know intimately throughout the novel.<br /><br />Despite this, Lost in the Forest is a very good book, and I highly recommended it.	2005-04-30
US	51369093	R3GPXQCJ3NU73N	0393060349	511808231	The History of Love: A Novel	Books	5	414	445	N	N	Brilliant but flawed	This book is very similar in both content and tone to  Jonathan Safran Foer's latest book, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. It's interesting to note that Foer and Krauss are husband and wife.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />This novel is told from the point of view of several narrators.<br /><br />The first, and best narrator, (the parts that feature him are brilliant),  is Leo Gursky. Leo lives by himself in New York. He was born in Poland, and fell in love with a girl named Alma. They vowed to spend their lives together.<br /><br />Due to the war, Leo and Alma were separated, and Leo has spent his life alone, pining for Alma.<br /><br />The other main narrator is a young girl also named Alma, who has lost her father to pancreatic cancer and lives with her young brother and mother. All have been terribly damaged by his death.<br /><br />Although we occasionally get other narrators, the story is essentially told by these two wounded individuals. Alma tries to find the woman for whom she was named, and Leo tries to become a part of the living world, and become a part of his son Isaac's life. And all of this centers around a mysterious book entitled The History of Love.<br /><br />This is a gorgeous book. Like Foer's novel, this book is funny, sad, and quirky. At times a bit too quirky.<br /><br />I thought the chapters involving Leo were terrific. The book starts out with Leo's narration, and hence the book starts out on a powerful note.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed the character of young Alma, the chapters involving her were often odd, and sometimes slowed the pace of the story.<br /><br />Still, this book is worthy of 5 stars, and it would make a wonderful book club choice...there is a lot to discuss.<br /><br />So who has the better book, Foer or Krauss? My vote goes to Krauss, who wrote a page turner that has a better flow, and is more accessible than the Foer's work.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-04-28
US	51369093	R31CYN0M9LK5CO	1400043395	813354201	Never Let Me Go	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Interesting Read (no spoiler review)	I am starting off this review saying \\"no spoilers\\". I am doing so because virtually all of the reviews I have read (here on Amazon as elsewhere) give away a central twist. I can understand why...it's hard to talk about without giving away certain central information.<br /><br />I think this book is enjoyable whether or not you have any advanced knowledge of this twist, but as with any novel, it can best be appreciated if you read it as the author intended, gaining your knowledge of events when the author intends you to.<br /><br />Saying all that, this review will be tricky, but I will try.<br /><br />The beginning of this novel  takes place in the seemingly idealic setting of a private school named Hailsham. The kids there are educated in the basics, but with special emphasis in the arts and in literature. They are rewarded for their creative achievement.<br /><br />The story follows the characters of Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, as they first become friends at Hailsham, and later on as they leave the school, as required,  when they become 16 years old.<br /><br />While reading this novel, we are filled with an impending sense of doom. Something is not right, and we are not looking forward to what happens when the students leave Hailsham.<br /><br />I thought this was an entertaining story. I read it in one sitting, although the first few pages were slow going for some reason for me.<br /><br />I think it is a provocative tale, but one that has been told before, and better. It is a little heavy-handed, and there are some major questions the reader is left with at the end that are not really addressed.<br /><br />All in all, I do recommend this novel. It is well-written, and it's easy to lose yourself in the story of these 3 remarkable individuals. And after all, isn't that one of the reasons we read?<br /><br />Recommended, and sorry if this review appears a little odd...I truly think this book can best be appreciated if you approach it without any advanced knowledge of certain aspects of the plot.	2005-04-25

They even made a movie about that, which made him a relatively well-known person.<br /><br />At the beginning of this novel, Nick is contacted by a woman named Liza to find her daughter Amanda. The story is about that quest.<br /><br />We can sense that something is wrong physically with Nick, but we don't find out what until about 1/4 of the way into the book, exactly what is wrong.<br /><br />I give this 3 stars because as a mystery story, I found it rather mediocre. It almost seemed rushed to me, and there is too much coincidence and \\"luck\\" for my taste.<br /><br />What is unique and good about this novel, is the concept that the protagonist would have to deal with memory problems (you know that from right away, that isn't a spoiler.)<br /><br />This book is still entertaining, and it does have a twist at the end. But other than the \\"Memento\\" like aspects, it just wasn't anything special.	2005-04-25

He decides to write down his family history, and his thoughts about life, for the benefit of his young 6 year old son.<br /><br />John's remembrances go back and forth in time, and often read like diary entries. We learn about John's father and grandfather, also both ministers...although each with very different personalities.<br /><br />This is a very quiet book. It's beautifully written, and and filled with profound revelations and thoughts about the meaning of our lives.<br /><br />I think one really needs to be in a certain mood to read Gilead, almost a meditative state. There is very little \\"action\\" in this book, and yet it is expansive in it's reach.<br /><br />Recommended, but best be in the right mood to read it.	2005-04-21

For those of you in a reading slump, just pick up this book and read the first page and see if you aren't pulled into to this interesting story.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />This is the story about  Arlene Fleet, who had fled her hometown of Possett Alabama and has lived in Chicago for the last 10 years.<br /><br />Arlene has vowed never to return to Possett because of something that happened there, and she has made promises to God (i.e. she won't lie, she won't have sex, etc.,) if God enables her to keep her \\"crime\\" hidden.<br /><br />To her great frustration, Arlene finds that she has to return to Posset both  to face her past, and to introduce her boyfriend Burr to her her bigoted family (Burr is black and a northern Baptist, Arlene is white and southern Baptist.)<br /><br />The book is well written, and a real page turner. There are many laugh out loud funny lines, and it's one of those books you can easily read from start to end in one sitting.<br /><br />Saying all this, I was somewhat disappointed in this novel. Even though I really liked these characters, for some reason, they all just didn't ring true to me. Perhaps some of the characters seemed a little too stereotyped, or parts of the book were a bit rushed.<br /><br />I would still recommend this book. It has a lot to say about memory, and the price we pay for keeping our silence. It is entertaining, and has a TERRIFIC finish, which is something pretty rare nowadays.	2005-04-20

Hence the reviews varying from one star to five.<br /><br />Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is similar, and if you enjoyed the first book, I think you will like this one.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />Oskar Schell is a precocious (to say the least) nine year old who lives in Manhattan with his mother. His grandmother lives a few flights upstairs.<br /><br />Oskar's father Thomas was killed on 9/11. He was in a meeting in the Twin Towers when the planes struck.<br /><br />The story follows Oskar as he finds a \\"mysterious\\" key in his fathers closet. Because he is so deeply wounded by the loss of his father, he makes a mission out of finding the purpose of the key. This quest takes Oskar all around New York.<br /><br />In between chapters of Oskar's quest, we hear about the history of Oscar's grandmother, who's husband left her before Thomas was born. Although confusing at first, when that plot comes together, it is very touching.<br /><br />Foer is truly an original, and I find his writing unique and quirky. He can manage to make you laugh out loud and then tear up, all in the same paragraph.<br /><br />Saying all this, I am still giving this book 4 stars, because I found Oskar's precociousness so overbearing at times, that I actually found myself skimming some  of the story.<br /><br />Despite it's flaws, this book is still highly recommended.	2005-03-29

Mind you, it's still a fantastic book, and it's full of the thoughtful and intelligent prose to which McEwan excels. But in comparison to his other works, I would place Saturday squarely in the middle.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />This novel follows 24 hours in the life of neurosurgeon Dr. Henry Perowne, as he wakes up very early one Saturday morning, not long after 9/11.<br /><br />Henry is a happily married family man, and we follow him along in his day as he plays squash with a physician friend, visits his elderly mother who is suffering from dementia, and gets involved in an incident of road rage which will come back to haunt him before the end of the day.<br /><br />In typical McEwan fashion, I found myself rereading and marking off certain passages just because I wanted to get back to them, because they were so perfectly evocative and descriptive. The dialogue, in particular the conversation between Henry and his mother, is spot on...and anyone who has had a conversation with a loved one who is suffering from dementia will nod their heads in recognition.<br /><br />As impressed as I was with this book,  I did have trouble with certain things. Henry's family was just a little too perfect to me, and I never found them very real. The biggest problem I had (and again, no spoiler...) is with the very end of the book, when Henry takes on a \\"task\\" which I found at the very least, legally and ethically wrong. I understand the need for this as a plot devise, but it took me out of the book.<br /><br />Again, although this is not my favorite McEwan (and I have read them all), this book is highly recommended. It is thoughtful, well-written, and a true mirror of our times and of our lives.	2005-03-22

Hassan is the son of Ali, a servant to Baba. Hassan serves as Amir's servant also.<br /><br />The story is one of friendship and betrayal, and of class struggle and religious persecution. The themes are universal, but we also learn insights and values that are uniquely Afghani.<br /><br />The tale starts out in a prosperous, modern Kabul, but then takes us through the the destruction and takeover by the Soviets,  up to the Taliban, and even past 9/11.<br /><br />This book would be terrific for book clubs, because not only is it entertaining and gripping, but it gives us an insight into an Afghanistan that few would have.<br /><br />I, for one, didn't realize what an modern and beautiful city Kabul was in the 1970's....I have been so used to seeing pictures of that war ravaged country it's hard to believe it wasn't always that way.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the story is a little too manipulative, and there is one \\"twist\\" that was too coincidental for my taste.....but I still recommend it highly.	2005-03-19

He chooses The Shadow of the Wind, a novel by a man named Julian Carax.<br /><br />Daniel discovers that someone is trying to burn all of Carax's books, and he tries to find out why.<br /><br />Big time adventure ensues, as Daniel tries to figure out the puzzle that is Carax's life....which at many times mirrors Daniel's own circumstances.<br /><br />This novel is not only an exciting tale of intrigue and adventure, it is also VERY funny. Daniel has a sidekick named Fermin, who is truly one of the most witty and memorable characters in literature.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough.

The story is centered around siblings Jack and Josie.<br /><br />The plot, no spoilers...<br /><br />The story starts out with a description of 19 year old Jack, and 17 year old Josie. They are the exceptionally attractive children of an eccentric, rage filled professor, and a deceased, mentally ill mother. They live with the professor in isolation, in an old home on a hill, where they have been home schooled.<br /><br />The story really takes off when these two decide to leave home....<br /><br />This is a dark story, and is a like a mix of the works of V.C.

I believe him to be one of the best writers out there.<br /><br />Given that, I can say that the writing in The Darling lives up to the high level I have set for Banks. It is entertaining, and I was interested in the story from page one.<br /><br />Why not five stars? Because the story, in my opinion, was flawed.<br /><br />Brief summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />Hannah is a young woman from a privileged family, who joins the Weatherman organization in 1969. Her father is a famous pediatrician and author of several books, who is also anti-war and liberal.<br /><br />The story begins with Hannah narrating the story of her life, looking back on those events as a 60 year old woman living on a farm she owns and operates in the U.S.<br /><br />She describes her moving to Africa in the early 1970's, where she marries and has 3 children. You know from the beginning of the book that Hannah has not had contact with her husband and children in a long time, and by novel's end we know why.<br /><br />As fascinating as this story is, the character of Hannah never rang true for me, and additionally I felt the author (and Hannah) judged Hannah's mother more harshly than I would have. I found myself impatient and frustrated with Hannah, and in ways that I don't think the author intended (although I understand she is supposed to be a flawed character.) It is primarily for this reason that I give this novel 4 stars, although the prose is Banks at the top of his form.<br /><br />One further note, if you have problems with novels that show animal cruelty, (and I do), please be forewarned that this novel contains such content. Hannah becomes a caretaker of chimpanzees during this novel, and frankly I found myself skimming over several of the scenes concerning their treatment.<br /><br />All in all, still recommended, with the reservations expressed above.	2005-02-18

He remains in Kars, while it suffers the worst snowstorm in decades.<br /><br />One reason he journeys to Kars is because he is doing a story about a group of young girls who have committed suicide because they were not allowed to wear their head scarves to school.<br /><br />The other reason is because he has heard that his old schoolmate, the beautiful Ipek, has divorced, and he wants to see her and perhaps make her his wife.<br /><br />Snow is an interesting book. It's truly gives one insight as to what life is like in Turkey, and in particular, for those not acquainted, with the Islamic world itself.<br /><br />It is a bleak portrait. But an eye-opening one. The differences between the various cultures described are enormous, and the mistrust, misunderstanding, and hatred between all the political and religious groups within Turkey itself are profound.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy a quick read, be aware that this novel starts off at a good pace, but it becomes a very slow read by page 100 or so. I am usually a fast reader, but I found it impossible to read more than 50 or 75 pages at a clip, without having to put the book down.<br /><br />Perhaps part of the problems with the flow of this book come from it being a translation. The dialogue is a little clunky, and the prose in general is dense and intense.<br /><br />That said, I still recommend this book. It may not be the easiest read, but it's an interesting one. And I think it's a book that would be good for group discussions.	2005-01-27

Stephanie Kallos is a talented writer, and I found myself caught up the story to the point that I didn't want to put the book down.<br /><br />And then I got past Part One. And that's when my troubles with this novel began.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />Margaret is a wealthy woman and she lives alone in a huge house with many valuable antiques. She seems to have an almost unnatural attachment and devotion to them.<br /><br />Wanda is a 30+ single woman with a mysterious past who comes and rents a room from Margaret, after Margaret discovers that she has brain tumor and decides to take in tenants.<br /><br />The story goes back and forth between the lives and the pasts of these two interesting women.<br /><br />As I said, up until the midway point of this book, I thought this was a terrific tale. But then many incredible coincidences start to pile up, and the story became too manipulative for my taste.<br /><br />By book's end, I found myself wanting to fling this book away. Even though I found it so disappointing, I gave it 4 stars, because there is some beautiful writing, and because it started off so well.<br /><br />Well written, but ultimately a frustrating read.	2004-12-28

After having been in a fiction slump, I have hit upon a few winners lately, and this is one.<br /><br />Summary (no spoilers):<br /><br />The novel starts out with three separate chapters taking place at various points in time, from 1970 to 1994. Each of the chapters tells about a horrible crime, or \\"case history\\".<br /><br />The book then goes on to the present, where private detective Jackson Brodie has been hired by various persons to look into these past crimes.<br /><br />By the end of the book, there is resolution to the three case histories, and a mention of a fourth case history, that has to do with Detective Brodie himself.<br /><br />This is a moving, funny, sad, but always interesting novel. Guaranteed to grab you from the first page and keep you entertained until the end.<br /><br />With the exception of one annoying coincidence (for me), the novel works as a mystery tale and one of psychological suspense.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-12-21

The first story consists of the letters of Adam Ewing, and his fateful trip on a ship in the Pacific in the mid 1850's.<br /><br />From there we go to the second story, which takes place in the 1930's and is told from the viewpoint of Robert Frobisher, a talented disinherited muscial composer who visits an infirm maestro and his family in an attempt to get work and advantage. His story is told through his letters to a scientist friend/lover named Rufus Sixsmith.<br /><br />The next story takes place in the 1970's, and has to do with reporter Luisa Rey, and her exposure of corporate malfeasance that could result in disaster. Sixsmith is a scientist there, and plays an important part of the story.<br /><br />Next, (and my personal favorite), is the story of Timothy Cavendish, in present day England, and the tale of his (mis) adventures as a book publisher. Utterly hilarious and poignant.<br /><br />The second to last story becomes a sci/fi read of future corporate controlled Korea, complete with cloned humans.  And the final story is one that takes place in post apocalyptic Hawaii.<br /><br />And then we go back to each story, in opposite order, and put the pieces together and complete the cliffhanger endings from the first half.<br /><br />I think this book is brilliant. I often found myself rereading various sections because I found them so ingenius and profound. I think David Mitchell is one of the most talented new writers around.<br /><br />My only complaint? Sometimes I think that the author was a bit taken with his own writing, and was too clever for his own good. At points the writing became tedious, although never to the point that I wanted to throw in the towel.<br /><br />Note...I personally had trouble getting through chapter one, but then I was hooked by chapter two. If you find yourself getting impatient, hang in there.<br /><br />Highly recommended, with the reservations expressed above.ourself getting impatient, hang in there.

If you are having a reading slump, I highly recommend this to jump start your reading.<br /><br />The book tells the tale of a pregnant single woman named Verona, who meets a man named Zeke. Zeke has mild Aspergers syndrome, and in the course of a day or so, and under rather unusual conditions, they fall in love. They are separated, and spend the majority of the book trying to get back together.<br /><br />The middle of the book was my favorite part, and it dealt with the recollections and life of Verona's grandfather. That was the book I really wanted to read, and that story elevated this novel to 5 stars in my opinion.<br /><br />For me personally, I had trouble buying into the relationship between Verona and Zeke, although it didn't affect my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />So this book is recommended. It held my interest from page one, right through to the end.	2004-12-14

John Barron hunts down the elusive and secretive killer, Raymond Thorne.<br /><br />The story is epic in nature, and by the time you finish, you really feel like you have been on an adventure yourself.<br /><br />There are lots of secrets to learn, and lots of twists and turns and hidden identities. If you have ever read Folsom before, then you know how entertaining he can be.<br /><br />On the negative side, the characters are stereotypical though entertaining, and at times I felt like I was reading a screenplay more than a book. (And this would make a terrific movie.)<br /><br />On the plus side, this book ends with a stunning last page...but you can't cheat and have to read the entire book to appreciate it. It's that good.<br /><br />Recommended.	2004-09-08

This is an astounding book. It is multi-layered and moody. It is terrific fun.<br /><br />The story is about a young man named Gerard, born in Australia to a very strange mother who tells the young boy stories of her childhood. When Gerard discovers a strange photo of a beautiful woman hidden in her drawer, his mother becomes horrified, and stops her stories, and the boy is left to wonder about her past and why she is so reluctant to share it with him.<br /><br /> This novel is full of intrique and deception, and we are told some truly frightening ghost stories written by his great-grandmother, Viola.<br /><br />Okay, here is the thing....when I first read this book, I was confused as to the ending, like so many reviewers here. So I read it again, and I figured it out. This story does makes sense, the author doesn't cheat, and there are answers to most of the big questions. It is a brilliant story filled with twists and full of  irony and  chilling retribution.<br /><br />Each ghost story has a relevance to the book, and the overall tone and use of layering and deception is stunning. This book will stay with you for a long time.<br /><br /> This is my favorite book this year, and I am going to recommend it to everyone. Read it carefully, and if you are still confused, read it again. I promise you it will be worth it, and you will agree with me that this is a brilliant, complex novel deserving of a big audience.	2004-08-11

Once you accept the premise, I felt the author did have some interesting things to say about Beauty, and how powerful a force it is in our culture.<br />I give this book 4 stars because I thought it was a quick, fun, entertaining read. It's not simply a Revenge book, although it's that. It's also a mirror on how our society works.	2004-07-19

Let's just say that this book is a typical but exceptional hilarious Hiaasen tale where everything goes wrong.<br />The characters include science challenged biologist Chaz, and his wonderful, rich wife Joey (who he throws off of a cruise ship on page one.) There is also an ex-policeman living on an island, a wild hairdresser with some interesting quirks, a behemoth bodyguard with so much body hair he was once shot because he was mistaken for a bear, a sleazy corporate bad guy, and a Vietnam vet who mistakes the people he meets for famous persons. Oh, and a detective who has two giant pythons.<br />Yes, this is a typical Hiaasen romp. And a good one.<br />Highly highly recommended. (Just not around anyone trying to sleep!)	2004-07-17

And this does not make Hugo happy, to say the least.<br /><br />Hugo Whittier is a curmudgeon. He is sarcastic, rude, incredibly intelligent, and does not suffer fools lightly. Oh, and he is dying. He doesn't have to die, but he is unwilling to give up smoking which is making his condition worse.<br /><br />This is an entertaining book, with with some very clever prose and dialogue.<br /><br />I was hooked at page one. Read Hugo's story, and about how life can throw you some surprising turns, even if you are determined to dodge them.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-07

The stories are beautifully written, and I found myself continually marking pages for prose that I wanted to reread.<br />This is also one of those novels that is about Time. You see entire lives having been lived, and it makes you think about your own mortality and accomplishments.<br />I ended this novel with a heavy heart. Despite the fact that I am too young to have remembered the 50's, I felt like I had known these women, and their own angst and frustrations became mine.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-07

Max meets the woman who is love of his life at three different stages in his life, and their relationship changes with the circumstances of their meeting and their repective ages to each other.<br />This is not only a beautiful love story, but a wonderful tale about age and infirmity, and a history of San Francisco from the late 1800's to the mid 1900's. And gorgeous prose too.<br />Highly recommended for book clubs, and a must read for anyone interested in San Francisco.	2004-04-10

They, like so many other young couples, got caught up in the excitement and frenzy and were married when Michael returned early from the war. They are two different people, and had they met at another time and place, they probably would not have wound up together. The essential lesson here is the old proverb, marry in haste, repent at your leisure.<br />This book is a page-turner from the beginning, but really took off for me about 1/2 way through. It takes us through the various stages of the marriage between Michael and Pauline, as well as through events of the late 20th century. And Michael and Pauline are very real and complicated characters...your opinion of them will vary from page to page.<br />I am giving this book 5 stars, because I thought the ending was so terrific, and I was left thinking about this book for hours (days) after finishing.<br />I strongly recommend this novel for bookkclubs...there will be much to discuss.	2004-01-15

The following quote from the book (a letter to her ex-boyfriend) was also in a review of the novel. It's an example of some of the beautiful writing which runs throughout this fine book:<br />&quot;Maybe we're all born with a protective mental coating like a pomegranate seed has, an invisible placenta that prevents reality from piercing our tender brains, that allows us to fool ourselves until our last breath, that lets us actually believe that one day we'll be discovered and one day we'll be rich, one day the world will see our hidden genius, that lets me believe that somewhere in the recesses of your sweet heart and hard head you still care for me&quot;.<br />If you like this kind of writing, and want to get quickly involved in an interesting, sometimes funny/sweet /sad novel, this one is for you.	2004-01-12

Barton makes you understand how being wealthy doesn't automatically give you the best medical care, and it certainly doesn't protect you against death. He brings home in this very personal way how health and family are the things that are important, and that the end of life is a complicated, individual experience, full of reflection and introspection.<br />I thought that it was \\"gutsy\\" and generous of Barton to want to share his experiences with the world, and one gets the impression from the book that that is the kind of individual he was.<br />When you finish - you can do it easily in a few hours - you are left appreciative of the things that you normally take for granted, and can briefly try to comprehend the concept of living in the moment.<br />I say briefly because, alas, I think we are hardwired not to be able to live our lives the way Peter Barton did at the end of his life...living in the here and now and giving up the foolish pursuits that drive us daily. I think that is why books like this are important, so that we can read them and get back to what is important, and try to live our lives thinking about these issues and thus be \\"ready\\", when we face the end of our own lives.<br />Recommended, but I think I would have liked a little more information about Barton's illness and treatment although I understand that it was a conscious decision not to include that in the book.	2003-09-10

This Booker Award winning book is well deserving of the high praise it has received.<br />In a nutshell, the book ostensibly is about Pi, a young Indian son of a zookeeper who survives a shipwreck only to find himself on a lifeboat with an odd assortment of animals.<br />The story is much more than a story about survival, although it reads as a wonderful adventure book with many thrills along the way.<br />The book is also a book of &quot;religion&quot;, or a quest to find the meaning of life and of God. Meant for skeptics, agnostics and the religious, the book has meaning for everyone.<br />I also highly recommend this book for book clubs because when you finish the last sentence, you will want to talk about this novel.<br />This is a thought provoking, fun read, with enough ambiguity to keep any group discussion going for a long time.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-09-03

For some reason this review (after 11 years) got also placed under Joseph Heller's book, Something Happened. I contacted Amazon and they said that they cannot fix this so apologies.<br /><br />Brief summary (of Notes on a Scandal) and review, no spoilers.<br /><br />Barbara Covett is a 60ish spinster school teacher, opinionated, intelligent and very lonely. She becomes good friends with Sheba Hart, a beautiful, popular 42 year old new teacher who has just arrived at Barbara's school. The novel is told from the point-of-view of Barbara, as she befriends Sheba and discovers that Sheba may be having an affair with one of Sheba's young students.<br /><br />When I heard about the plot of this book, I have to admit I wasn't all that interested in reading it. But I picked up the book and read the first page and found it utterly compelling and an engrossing and intelligent read.<br /><br />Part of the brilliance of this novel is the way you learn about both characters by listening to the narrator, the aptly named Barbara Covett. All is not what it seems and the author does a wonderful job making these characters very real people. Heller does a wonderful job showing how single women relate to those married with children and how people deal with loneliness and routine. She also shows how we make rationalizations about ourselves and our actions in order to justify our beliefs that we are good, honorable people.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel for any book clubs. It would make for a great discussion,and I think that everyone is going to have a different opinion about each of these two women. Not only is this novel an intelligent read, but it's a fun one also. This book is a page-turner that leaves you thinking about it and wanting to talk about it with your friends..what more can you ask for?	2003-09-02

Although this was a quick, fun read, I have to disagree.<br />This really reads like a young adult fiction book...we are told the story from the viewpoint of a 14 year old girl named Lily Owen.<br />Lily has a troubled (to say the least) childhood, and she runs off to stay with a trio of black sisters (named May, June and August). There she makes discoveries about her past, and about life in general.<br />Although I thought there were sweet moments in the book, I felt it was all too simple, and as stated earlier, I felt like I was reading a book best written for a much younger audience.<br />I also could not shake the idea that I felt this novel portrayed the black characters in a very stereotyped way. I am not black, but I felt frustrated reading this book, and I found it all somehow insulting.<br />Again, this is an entertaining, quick read. I would recommend it as a &quot;coming of age&quot; book, but the stereotypes did bother me quite a bit.	2003-08-05

And he remains there until his meter has run out.<br />He does this simply for the delight of having that coveted parking place that had so often been unavailable in the past...when he needed it. The story continues with poor Tepper's run in with City Hall, when the manic mayor is convinced that Tepper's actions have darker ulterior motivations that have negative political consequences for those currently in power.<br />Some reviewers have said that one needs to live in Manhattan to truly appreciate this story, but I have to tell you, living in any big city nowadays one can identify with the concept of the &quot;good parking spot&quot;. And as for dealing with government bureaucracy, well... I think we can identify with that too!<br />This is a quick, fun read, and there is even a little &quot;twist&quot; at the end. Highly recommended. This is a very funny book and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2003-07-22

In particular, they planned to bomb Jewish owned businesses and stores such as Macy's. No, this doesn't take place now, but in 1942. And these terrorists are Nazis.<br /><br />The first part of the book describes the true story of how 8 Nazis landed on the eastern coast in 1942. These were men who had spent part of their lives in the United States, so they knew how to blend in and they knew American customs.  If not for the work of the FBI and for the defection of one of the men to the Americans, the damage that would have been done to America would have been horrendous and these 8 may have been just the first of many terrorists to follow.<br /><br />The second part of the book describes how these men were given quick military tribunals, because Roosevelt believed that public trials would only endanger our national security and our country. Sound familiar? This is a well-written, timely book that holds the reader's interest from start to finish. I thought I knew quite a bit about World War ll, but I didn't know anything about the events described in the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone concerned about the politics and policies of today, and for anyone who is simply interested in a good and interesting story.	2003-01-13

To write a book about a young idealistic 18th century Irishman who, after journeying to New York to avenge his father's death, is granted immortality under the condition that he remain in Manhattan.<br />For me, the best part of the book were the scenes (and smells!!) from New York, and the history we learn. I wish we had more of that.<br />I thought the beginning of the book that took place in Ireland went on a little too long for my taste...as I said, I enjoyed the New York stuff more. I also thought the book read a little bit like a Young Adult novel, especially in the beginning, with Cormac's family a little too \\"perfect\\" for my taste.<br />And lastly, I felt that the book tended to show a lot of stereotypes. And I just couldn't seem to kick that feeling that the book was meant for a younger audience.<br />Overall, the book was entertaining, and the mortality issue and end of the book was resolved in a satisfying way.	2003-01-13

You may not like this book, but it has some beautiful, evocative prose and dead-on dialogue...and I wonder if giving it\\"one star\\" is really more a reflection of a reader's disappointment based on certain expectations more than a rating of the book in general.<br />I enjoyed the author's previous work, The Secret History, even though I had problems \\"believing\\" in those characters. Despite this, I found that I didn't want to put that book down. When I was done reading it, I felt I had been transported to another place and time, and wanted to discuss the book with anyone within earshot.<br />Now, after reading The Little Friend, I feel the same way. I believe that the author has the ability to write books that sweep the reader away into the world that she has created. Is TLF perfect? No. But this is a wonderful, moody, dark  book that leaves you wanting to \\"talk about it\\" with others. (Always a good sign in my opinion.)<br />Mind you, this isn't a page turner, and normally if I heard a reviewer say that I would not buy a book....but in this case I think that is a mistake. Tartt spends a lot of time developing the background and mood for this story. And it pays off. It took me a few days to finish the book, but I was always looking forward to getting back to it.<br />I do recommend this book, but suggest that you don't finish this book just prior to bedtime...because this book leaves you with a lot to think about. This is a lot more than a \\"mystery\\" book, and if you read it as such you might be disappointed.<br />This a book about life, and \\"loss\\"...the loss of those we love, the loss of childhood and innocence... and how our actions, sometimes based on misunderstandings, can reek such destruction and chaos.<br />Start reading this book, and if you aren't \\"hooked\\" right away, then this may not be the book for you. But if you enjoy Tartt's prose and descriptions, and find yourself swept away into Tartt's world, than you are in for a wonderful reading experience.re in for a wonderful reading experience.	2002-11-03
