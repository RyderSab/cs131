But since there were no reviews, I did want to point out how qualified Brian Ladd is to write a companion guide to Berlin. I have just finished reading his \\"The Ghosts of Berlin\\" - which I highly recommend - and in it Ladd exhibits a close eye for architectural history and how Berlin, unique among all European capitals, wears its complex and troublesome history on its sleeve, so to speak. The monuments, the buildings - the contentious debates about the design and placement of new buildings - and even the parks and roads all ooze history and make Berlin such a rich place to visit. If Mr. Ladd has brought some of these same observations to his new book, it belongs in your suitcase the next time you visit Berlin.	2005-08-19

I agree with the previous reviewer: this book could have been unbearably boring, but Casson enlivens his subject, and you really do learn a lot about the architecture, scope and content of ancient libraries, beginning with those found in ancient Mesopotamia and continuing up until that most ambitious and learned of monks, Cassiodorus, founded his monastery--Vivarium--with its many books in 551 A.D.<br />There is everything of importance in between, including the history of the most magnificent of libraries--the Library of Alexandria--and the lesser known but very important library in Pergamum. Though this book is about libraries, you can't help learning about literacy, writing, the difference between papyrus and parchment, and the rise of the codex.<br />This is an invaluable little book that contains within its pages a collection of information that is rarely found between two covers (i.e. it's usually scattered among various books). For this service, Casson deserves praise.	2001-05-31

He starts out almost every chapter with a logical puzzle or paradox and proceeds to attempt to explain it, showcasing different logical tools along the way. On the whole, this is a good strategy.<br />But at the end of the book, you're left feeling a bit dissatisfied because so many of the puzzles/paradoxes are left unresolved and so much ground has been covered in so little space. I felt that it had too much breadth and not enough depth, despite the fact that this is a very short introduction (I've read a couple others and not all of them suffer this fate). But I've given the book 4 stars because it is interesting, lively and clear, and is perhaps a better introduction than most on the topic of logic, despite its occasional drawback.	2001-05-12

There is so much information packed into this tome that I found myself jumping from chapter to chapter. But a lot of this is fascinating. If you want to know about the correlation between intelligence and productivity or birth order and greatness, you can find it here. There is a treasury of great anecdotes about great people (my favorite is Brahms's comment about treading in the footsteps of a giant--Beethoven), and the book is a fast read (page-by-page that is--it's quite a lengthy book).<br />The drawback of the work is that it may lead you to think that we can really know what greatness is. Simonton has done his research and offers many arguments along these lines, but I couldn't help feeling at the end of it, that though I had a better understanding of different aspects of greatness--intelligence, productivity, charisma etc.--it wasn't entirely clear how they fit together in the form of an individual. There is still no sure way (and there will probably never be) of knowing beforehand whether someone will be great. Greatness cannot be made with any amount of certainty, even if we have all the ingredients (which we don't). Luck and contingency play too large a role.<br />Nevertheless this is a fun read and you can learn a lot!	2001-05-12

Is there a general factor in intelligence? Are there multiple types of intelligence, as Howard Gardner thinks? How do race or age affect intelligence? What is the 'Flynn effect'? All these questions are covered in some detail--given the length of the book--in Deary's clear exposition.<br />Basically, Deary convinced me that there is a general factor that accounts for one's mental abilities (but this is not to say that a high g factor--as it's called--will assure you success and praise in life or that a low one excludes you from it!).<br />Deary's discussion of twin studies and his own work on how the physiognomy of the brain correlates with intelligence (there is a correlation--of medium strength between brain size and intelligence) were particularly interesting.<br />This is a great introduction to the subject!	2001-05-11

Nabokov follows (although not usually linearly) the young Russian chess prodigy, Luzhin, through his strange and obsessive rise to the top of the chess world, his marriage to a fascinating and caring woman, and his slow, maddeningly intricate and psychologically complex 'downfall' (though this isn't the right word). I recommend this book for at least three reasons: 1) It's short and gripping 2) Nabokov's prose is inspiring and 3) The story of poor Luzhin makes you feel as if you too are going mad (this is a good thing--you get to experience a plausible account of madness without--let's hope--going mad yourself).

The VSI books from Oxford University Press are great; you get an enjoyably short but informative romp through the basics of a subject. This book is no exception. Critchley writes and argues well, and one of the books greatest strengths is that it targets readers who wonder why there is such a divide between 'Continental' (Critchley doesn't like this term, and I don't either) and 'Analytic' philosophers. Critchley makes a commendable effort to explain this divide in the hope that a future reconciliation will be made. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to that high ideal.<br />I currently study analytic philosophy so I understand where it's coming from and why it relies on the methodology it does. I cannot say the same for continental philosophy, and I was hoping this book would change that. It didn't. I found that I do understand the work of Heidegger better, and there are some great anecdotes concerning the inability of Rudolf Carnap and Heidegger to comprehend each other. Nevertheless, I still don't quite understand why continental philosophers resist the strategy of writing clear, concise prose to explain their ideas. This is not to condemn them; no doubt they have many good ideas that are worth hearing, but I can't understand them. Maybe I'm just missing the point; that's certainly very possible, but Critchley's little book was not able to show what it was that I was missing. In any case, if you're completely new to the subject, this is a nice little introduction that will increase your desire to read more.	2001-05-11

For the story of Enoch Soames alone, this collection is perhaps worth the price. Enoch Soames is a disheartened poet who is unappreciated. One day he becomes fed up with his inability to court fame (his second book sells 3 copies) and so makes an agreement with the devil to travel to the future to learn what's been written about him in return for an eternal trip to the Devil's home. I can't reveal what happens next, but suffice it to say that the story revels in metaphysical twists and fascinating character sketches.<br />Most of the other stories were disappointing (John Updike admits as much in the introduction).

Regardless, this collection of fictional stories and personal anecdotes is relevant to book lovers of all types. If you need to buy books, then buy this one too.<br />Yet, the collection was not wholly satisfying. Some of the stories were too long and others too short. The young Flaubert's story &quot;Bibliomania&quot; about a murdering, book-loving monk is a must-read, and was the highlight of the collection. If you're new to the world of bibliophilia and all its strange inhabitants and their stories, this is a good book to begin with.

So many reviewers concentrate on the depiction of the climactic Battle of Thermopylae that the other merits of the book (far more significant in my mind!) have been obscured.<br />First, I was vividly and realistically immersed into Spartan life and culture around 480 BCE. I got to know individual Spartan warriors and women in ways that I figured would not be possible. Pressfield brings Spartan history into your bedroom.<br />I found the Spartan's life of war and training to be surprisingly fascinating, especially because of the dozens of anecdotes that are scattered through Pressfield's book; it gives the rough and ready Spartans a more gentle, human face.<br />And the philosophical insights about phobologia, or the Spartan discipline of studying how to master fear, are really worth thinking over. I can't wait to read Pressfield's newest book, The Tides of War (concentrating on the Pelopponnesian War).<br />This book is not to be underrated--and don't let the fact that Pressfield also wrote \\"The Legend of Baggar Vance\\" deter you (how did he manage to write that book in between two powerful epic novels about Greek warfare and everyday life?).<br />Get this book. Read it and you will, in some small way, learn to respect the Spartans more than any study of history alone could give you.	2001-02-06

What would it be like if we one day discover that we can enter other universes (not so outrageous considering quantum theory)?

Lear's book is a copy of the Tanner Lectures that he gave to an audience at Cambridge University, so it is, unlike some of Lear's other works, quite academic.<br />If this doesn't bother you, then you're in for a real treat. Lear uses the tools of psychoanalysis (in a reasonable fashion, thankfully) to pick apart Freud's postulation of the death instinct, and Aristotle's decree that happiness is the highest good.<br />I was particularly impressed with his analysis of how guilt may have been a factor in both Freud and Aristotle's shaky attempts to base their theories on a single, all encompassing principle that gives life a teleological meaning.	2001-02-06

Books	3	18	24	N	N	A solid look into Wittgenstein's Religious Attitude	Wittgenstein is primarily known for his work on philosophy of logic, language and mind, but he was a cult figure at Cambridge when he taught there in the first half of the 20th century.<br />Part of this, I think, has to do with his eccentric but enduringly fascinating views on ethics and religion. In this book, the late Norman Malcolm, a protege of Wittgenstein's, examines a curioius remark Wittgenstein makes to his friend Maurice O'Drury--along the lines of 'seeing every problem from a religious point of view'. It's curious because W. was not religious in the traditional sense. Yet he was a deep thinker, passionate about his own attitude toward life. He was, in a sense, a grippingly spiritual man, and Malcolm's book is a worthwhile attempt to understand Wittgenstein's religious attitude toward life.<br />I recommend it for those interested in Wittgenstein, religion or spirituality.	2001-02-06

But of the excerpts I've read, it has already become clear to me how misleading and shallow the &quot;Publisher's Weekly&quot; review (posted above) of this book is.<br />You might expect Honderich to discuss his life in a respectable and proud way. Not so. He is completely frank and detached from his own past behaviors--as he says, it is a kind of confession. Although more of the book is in passive voice, this does not make it less exciting. Quite the contrary.<br />Who else would, for no apparent reason other than that he thinks everything must be told, describe his one encounter with a prostitute, or his numerous relationships with women? Honderich also does a good job of describing how he beacame a philosopher, and the kind of life he leads as a professor of philosophy in the zany world of academia.<br />This book is not the usual kind of autobiography; it's much more than that, and it's a shame that &quot;Publisher's Weekly&quot; didn't take the time to realize this.	2001-01-23

He has a great chapter on 'Superstitions' of writing. Still think that you shouldn't end a sentence with a preposition? Not so. The best response to someone who insists that you should is to tell the short anecdote about Churchill, as Trimble does: &quot;When the prime minister--a Nobel Laureate in literature--found that an editor of his memoirs had had the cheek to 'correct' one of his sentences ending in a preposition, he wrote back, 'This is the kind of impertinence up with which I shall not put.'&quot;	2001-01-19

And hopefully, it will be made into a great movie. Russell Crowe will be starring as John Nash sometime this Spring when he comes to Princeton (and New York) to begin filming the film adaptation of Nasar's book. Jennifer Connelly will be Alicia Nash, I think.<br />Anyways, the book is a great story of an incredible mind within a quirky, sometimes off-putting personality. Some of the reviewers of the book have said that they couldn't feel sorry for Nash because of how arrogant and cold he sometimes was to his colleagues and family. But I think this misses the point: those suffering from mental illness (and I think Nash's genius was always 60% madness) deserve sympathy, not reproach.<br />This is a riveting tale of a young man (he graduated with his Ph.D from Princeton when he was 21!) who was extremely smart in a magical way. And it's also a story of human tragedy. I'm not being terribly descriptive, but I recommend the book if you are interested in the concept of genius, the academic world or mental illness.<br />Finally, it's nice to know that Nash still walks the halls in Fine here at Princeton, trying to disprove the theory that math is a young man's game...	2001-01-19

Wittgenstein reminds me of what a 7th century monk might have been like.<br />Monk handles Wittgenstein's complex philosophy well sithout over simplifying it. Moreover, he never tries to separate W's philosophy from his personality. Since they are so closely linked, it would be a big mistake to do so, and Monk deftly avoids doing so.<br />Finally, I particularly liked the dozens and dozens of personal letters we have from W. and how Monk interpret's W's often bizarre behavior (he had a penchant for American detective stories...).

Read the chapter on the definition of social institutions and see how this conception allows for a much more robust collectivist collection of arguments. It's great stuff. To tell you the truth, I read this book for a research paper in philosophy and found it tremendously more exciting, cogent and insightful than all the other books I read except Kripke's.<br />I don't know why Bloor is not more well-known in philosophical circles.

Through this political life, we see the rise and fall of the republic of Florence that Machiavelli was so keen on preserving, and some of the fascinating characters in Florentine history like Duke Valentino.<br />We also get an original glimpse into Machiavelli's love life (Viroli thankfully refuses to censor the more carnal but revealing phrases in Machiavelli's correspondence), and philosophy of life itself.<br />Overall, a fast-paced, generally pleasing read.	2000-11-20

But Soames could have helped his readers out more by explicating his ideas and the arguments he critiques in plainer, simpler prose.<br />Soames claims he has written the book with the general audience in philosophy in mind, but it's a daunting task to get through. One gets the sense that Soames wants you to wrestle with his words in addition to his ideas. And in all fairness, some of these concepts are very obtuse, even in the realm of philosophy.<br />Style and explication aside, Soames does illuminate the notion of truth and the role it plays in ordinary language and more formalized languages. He has a keen mind and a talent for reconstructing and then demolishing philosophical arguments. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about what contemporary philosophers think about truth, but you better have more than an elementary background in the philosophy of language (and some symbolic logic wouldn't hurt either) if you want to dive into this book and understand it without hurting your brain.	2000-11-19

He is, as someone once remarked, the Bobby Fisher of contemporary philosophy.<br />This is evident in this book. Kripke argues that the key to understanding Wittgenstein's 'private language argument' in his &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; is found in Wittgenstein's discussion of rule following which comes near the beginning of PI. Though this thesis has been critiqued for its apparent dissimilarity to some other views of Wittgenstein's, it is striking, original and intriguing nonetheless.<br />The radical skepticism inherent in (Kripke's understanding of) the Wittgensteinian paradox is astounding and will lead you to question the very basis of your belief system. Read this book if you're into Hume, Wittgenstein, Berkeley or Kripke--it is, unlike many philosophical works, very easy to understand.	2000-11-19

It's not the best page-turner either.<br />But the reason this is a good book is because of its thesis and subsequent discussion of rationality and its psychological correlates. There aren't enough books out there that deal with this, so it's a swig of cold water to read this one.<br />Of course, David Hume came to these same conclusions almost 4 centuries ago. The insight is not what's original, but the attempt to anchor it within the scientific (rather than philosophic) framework is. The implications of the idea that Reason is just a tool for getting what we want are significant for philosophy (especially ethics and political philosophy). Read the book; skim it if necessary, but it is worth your money.	2000-11-16

I recommend getting the expanded edition ('translated' by Mark Twain). But if you get this one, here's what I think:<br />Retelling the famous story of Adam and Eve is always an exciting venture. There are so many cultural, religious and political overtones to the original story (or stories?) in the Bible that any retelling is bound to spark contention.<br />Milton's Paradise Lost is a great example of this. Even better are the stories by the long forgotten Gnostic Christians (See Elaine Pagels) who thought that the serpent was the hero of the story.<br />Twain has his own take on the matter. Adam is a boring, conceited man (at first) who is annoyed by Eve and her curiosity about everything. Eve is wonderful; she names everything (like Adam in the original story) and has an abundance of scientific wonder of the world. The only thing odd in this story was its avoidance of the temptation of Eve by the serpent--it was only mentioned in passing. Personally, I find that the most interesting part (see Milton) and i would haved loved to see Twain's thoughts on it.<br />Nevertheless, this is a short, funny (isn't Twain always?) and lively book that you can get through in an hour. If for no other reason, read it for its redemption of Eve from the sexist (and confusing) story of the OT.	2000-11-16

But it's also short and lively so it won't take much time to skim through.<br />Essentially, Bradley talks about his grand, unabashadly liberal and idealistic vision of the future of America. His guiding motivation is this: Right now America has achieved unparalleled economic wealth and global success. If we don't use this opportunity to help those who cannot help themselves, then when will we ever? It's a strong argument and Bradley is surprisingly fair-minded about it (for instance, he is not willing to sacrifice our economic prosperity for big spending programs even though he wants big spending programs to help the poor and uneducated. This is an admirable ideal, but it's probaly not very feasible. Then again, has anyone tried?)<br />The best aspects of this book are Bradley's anecdotes from the lessons he learned as a child or from his experience on the campaign trail in his unsuccessful bid for president this past year.<br />Other than that, if you know his proposals and his 'stump' speech (like what he gave at the  DNC), then  this book is not for you. If you do not, then it's worth your money and your time.	2000-11-16

This book, his most recent, will only elevate his reputation.<br />In a series of historical vignettes, the reader learns about (among other things) the famous but mysterious duel between Hamilton and Burr, the awkward problem of slavery in the 1790s, the collaboration between Madison and Jefferson, George Washington's farewell and the famous relationship between John Adams (who is underappreciated according to Ellis) and Jefferson.<br />Every vignette reads like a short story. The facts are riveting, the writing (as usual) is lucid, succint and sufficiently surprising. And the historical era of the 1790s can't fail to interest us all.<br />There's absolutely no reason why this should not be the next book you buy. Get it for Christmas and give it as a gift to someone else. Where else will you learn, with such intelligence and historical insight, how majestic Washington was, how human Adams was, how strange Jefferson's personality was, and how conniving all the politicians were in the salad days of our country?	2000-11-14
