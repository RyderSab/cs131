Had I known that the author was pseudonymous and claims to \\"live off the grid,\\" I would have avoided it with vengeance--ugh!  So, how does the book read \\"cold?\\" Well, the author has done his research on modern survelliance technology, so the factoids read plausible (leaving aside the genetically-enhanced hyenas, at least).  He's clearly up to date on his Chomsky and Adbusters, since the bad guys in the book depend on the braindead masses, happily force-fed unfufilling desires through advertising to perpetuate their system. I wanted to find the book thought-provoking, but I felt too much like I was being earnestly lectured by a college freshman on how the \\"sheeple\\" are being led by a cynical, power and profit-driven corporate empire.  In other words, don't look for nuance here.  <br /> <br /> I was willing to accept the storyline, a compendium of cliches, for entertainment purposes, until I reached the last page and discovered that the novel is the first of many.  This has been an annoying trend in the SF publishing world lately.  Who is the idiot who thought that it was a clever marketing idea to sneak unfinished storylines onto the market?  Guess what, guys:  this novel is in no way so good that I will feel compelled to keep buying follow-ups because I simply must find out how it all turns out.  Sheesh.	2005-09-25

The action is nonstop and hugely entertaining, as a young Arthur Conan Doyle finds himself caught up in a conspiracy theory with occult overtones.  Each of the individual set pieces are quite imaginative. I am not surprised to discover that this is a first novel, though.  The ending is curiously flat, with a number of intriguing plot threads wrapped up perfunctorily and a final revelation that I found more groan-worthy than shocking. Still, this is a promising debut and well worth the read when mind candy is called for.      Addendum:  the reason for the dangling plot threads became apparent to me today when I saw the sequel in the bookstore.  As I can't decide whether to increase my rating to reflect this or decrease it in disgust at the new trend of publishers hiding the fact that novels aren't stand-alones, I'll leave it be.	2005-08-09

Perhaps what makes her cookbooks so popular is the impression she gives that we can.  Good food, grown yourself or obtained fresh, simply prepared, and appreciated with friends--these things do not require a farmhouse in Provence to enjoy.  Nevertheless, owning such a farmhouse would be a joy, and Wells, along with photographer Robert Freson, charmingly captures the experience of farming, cooking, and entertaining in Provence.  As for the recipes, they are, like those in all of Wells' books, fairly simple to execute, fresh, appealing, and very tasty.  By baking an olive oil brioche, roasting a chicken, or mixing up a simple tapanade, we too can experience the pleasure that comes from making food with our own hands and sharing with family and friends.	2005-04-25

The head of security at the castle has been cursed to see the ghosts of those murdered until their killer has been caught. The plot is the now-cliched one of the twisted serial killer who mutilates and eats his victims for some pseudo-psychological motivation or other, but the fantasy setting gives it some freshness and Jones keeps the story moving at a healthy pace. The characters and the atmosphere are interesting, and I recommend this novel as a light, entertaining read.	2005-03-18

This book provides an attractive overview of the Mediterranean garden style using some textual descriptions and many photos, with an emphasis on pics of Italian and southern California gardens. Even though many of the classic Mediterranean garden plants are not hardy for me, this book is still useful for studying the structure and design elements of a Mediterranean garden. My only complaint is that the photos appear washed out.  I'm sure this was deliberate --- these are \\"sun-drenched\\" gardens, after all --- but it makes the detailed structure and the individual plants difficult to discern.	2005-03-08

Photographer David McDonald revels in bold colors and dramatic textures and captures some wonderful gardens. I live in the arid high plains of Colorado while the gardens in this book are mostly of the green, wet Pacific Northwest, so this book doesn't provide much in the way of practical ideas for my garden.  Nevertheless, the bold designs featured are inspirational and great fun to look at.  Author Hobbs is the typical, obsessed plantsman, with a great eye for plant combinations and a house to die for.  I found his text a bit fluffy, though, with all sorts of advice for embracing your inner gardener or somesuch.  This is not a book I turn to for practical gardening information, but it's great for inspiration.	2005-02-15

The Peloponnesian War well repays the investment of time necessary to read it, however.  Kagan covers the primary events and players in the war with clarity and is not afraid to speculate about probable scenarios where the evidence is inconclusive (but notes these instances up front).  Although I am usually not interested in fighting tactics, the accounts of the battles in this book were fascinating, even suspensful.  The lifstyles and beliefs of the ancient Greeks, classic arguments concerning forms of rule (democracy versus oligarchy being a key source of conflict in this war), and the origins and costs of war, are all covered in this excellent history.	2005-01-03

Fingersmith follows two orphan girls in Victorian England through the twists and turns of a complex fight to possess inheritance money. The novel is an entertaining trip through the seamy underside of 19th century English life, but how is became a Booker nominee is beyond me --- it must have been a thin year for Commonwealth literature.  The novel is completely plot-driven, with characters who achieve two dimensions but do not approach three. The definition of great literature is a matter of opinion.  Mine is that it should say something about the world as it truly is, about what it means to be human.  Fingersmith is a fun read but not illuminating and ultimately shallow.	2004-11-25

In the preface to the 2nd edition, the preface to the 1st edition, and later in the Introduction, Savill makes reference to the \\"disturbed modern world\\", which leads one to the sneaking suspicion that she is inclined to romanticize Alexander and his times.  This suspicion is later confirmed when she laments that today's soldiers are denied the \\"exhilaration\\" of combat that soldiers of antiquity were able to enjoy.  (There is little doubt that Alexander himself found combat exhilarating, but I fear Savill has little appreciation for the experience of war for the average soldier.)   <br /> <br />I didn't give Savill's history the minimum rating because she does cover the primary events of Alexander's short career clearly and with charming prose.  Her interpretation is profoundly untrustworthy, however:  every criticism of Alexander stems from  the sniping of obvious inferiors, every salacious story traced to untrustworthy sources, every negative act ascribed to the fault of the victim or to the pressures of leadership.  This hagiography left me in the curious position of feeling that I had to defend Alexander against the embarrassing attentions of his own biographer.   <br /> <br />Indeed, I feel I learned more about Agnes Savill from this work than I did about Alexander of Macedonia.  Here is my mental picture of Savill:  Agnes Savill, spinster, amateur historian, a product of the Victorian era and a romantic adherent to its goal of spreading civilization to every corner of the known world, uncomfortable with sex (she counts it as a virtue that Alexander had little interest in the pleasures of the flesh) but attracted to the image of a cultured man of war, disdainful of the modern world, blinkered.  My picture probably bears no relation with reality but perhaps conveys the tone of Savill's biography.	2004-11-24

I've read the first part and it looks like a useful summary of hardware, ingredients, substitutions, etc.  I haven't used it as a reference yet, so my review is heavily biased toward the second section. This I find very impressive.  There are many cookbooks out there that provide recipes for simple, homey desserts and many that cover elaborate presentation dishes. Daley's recipes fit very nicely in between these two extremes.  The recipes tend to take classic concepts -- spice cake, fruit tart, etc. -- and apply them to original desserts that are excellent marriages of flavors that are not forced or ackward. The recipes are well tested;  I have not had a failure with one yet.  I highly recommend this book for enthusiastic home bakers.	2004-10-15

It is similar in look and feel to the Paris cookbook, but each has its own spirit.  The Paris cookbook focuses on the use of produce and meat from city markets as well as recipes from chefs with whom Wells has worked.

It's an absolutely outstanding novel and is that rare case of genre fiction that transcends its genre and qualifies as literature.  The story is simple --- the title says it all --- but compelling and the characterization, narration, and dialogue are sharp and intelligent.  Best of all, the characters drive the story, rather than the other way around (a common failing in sf, where ideas are typically much more interesting than people).  The entire novel takes place on The River of Stars, a Jovian merchant ship that has seen better days.  Its crew and a single passenger are the only characters, and their backgrounds and interactions propel the story to its tragic conclusion.  There are very few missteps in this book. I can think of two:  that the characters of Corrigan and Gorgas seem fuzzily delineated (were they a single character in an earlier draft?) and that mysterious events in the pasts of the crew are somewhat abruptly and implausibly revealed at the end of the book.  These are minor, however, given the overall success of the novel, which I highly recommend.	2004-01-19

The portraits of the rigid, determinedly unhappy Great Granny Webster, her flighty, insane daughter, and the outwardly frivolous but suicidal granddaughter are classic black comedy, amusing and depressing together. The women dominate the story;  the men are either dead (the narrator's father), absent (her brother), or ineffectual (her grandfather). The book is short, but the characters are affecting and vividly portrayed.	2003-12-02

I'm neither Thai nor Vietnamese, but my guess would be that the recipes, which come largely from Pham's American restaurant, have been adapted somewhat to appeal to non-native palates (the spice level in the Thai recipes seems low, for example).  Those looking for \\"authentic\\" Thai or Vietnamese recipes may want to look elsewhere.<br />That having been said, I sometimes find the authenticity fetish a bit much.  If you read Pham's chapter introductions, you discover that she is a woman who has moved around a great deal, and her cooking has been influenced by multiple native traditions.  Cooking in America is a real melting pot venture, and while this has led to some deserved ribbing from those whose countries have more developed palates, it has also led to a dynamic, creative treatment of food.  I think Pham's work falls on the positive side of this dichotomy.  To put it plainly, her recipes taste good, are well written and tested, and combine different cuisines with good results.  Her recipes are not fusion, and are not ground-breaking in the way of those of say, Ming Tsai, but they are simple and tasty.	2003-11-04

I'm glad I gave it a try.  Ventus suffers from some of the same problems present in Permanence:  Schroeder's writing style is undeveloped, as are his characters.  Indeed, he suffers from the classic characterization flaw of telling rather than showing (we basically have to take the narrator's  word for it that Calandria May is unhappy with life, for example).  Nevertheless, Ventus is overall a success.  Schroeder keeps the plot moving and deftly handles the large cast of characters.  The real centerpiece here is the planet, Ventus, and as we slowly learn more about its history and purpose, it becomes the most interesting character in the book.  Although Schroeder doesn't develop them as far as he might, his ideas concerning the uses of nanotechnology, the nature of humanity and sentience, and far-future lifestyles and ethics are original and thought-provoking.  Ventus is good SF.	2003-11-04

Proctor is knowledgeable and opinionated, and his books are always a delight to read.  Here, he covers the process of selecting and planting bulbs for long-term, self-sustaining growth and enjoyment. He divides the bulbs up by season of bloom and discusses bulbs appropriate for all areas of the country.

Once I read her books, I was even more sorry that she died so prematurely, because her mysteries are among the funniest books I've read.  Caudwell has a wonderful ironic tone.  She uses the standard mystery formula populated with her broadly drawn cast of regulars to send up academics, lawyers, tax collectors, amateur detectives...the whole lot. <br />As someone who conducts research for a living, I was particularly amused by the following, as Hilary (our narrator of indeterminate gender) makes his/her way to work:<br />&quot;On my first day in London I made an early start.  Reaching the Public Record Office not much after ten, I soon secured the papers needed for my research and settled in my place.  I became, as is the way of the scholar, so deeply absorbed as to lose all consciousness of my surroundings or of the passage of time.  When at last I came to myself, it was almost eleven and I was quite exhausted: I knew that I could not prudently continue without refreshment.&quot;<br />This quotation give the flavor of the whole book, really the entire series.  If you turn to mysteries for their psychological characterizations or examination of the dark side of life, this book will not do it for you, but if you love intelligent satire, Caudwell can't be beat.	2003-05-28

Perhaps those would be my feelings too were it not for Krakauer's sympathetic portrayal of McCandless and others who don't fit into mainstream society and search for a different life on the margins.  Krakauer does a masterful job hunting down the people McCandless met on his journey, presenting historic examples of other misfits, and evoking the hunger for freedom that drives so many adventurers, but then gives the last word to Chris' mother, reminding us that the price paid by those who love and are left behind is severe.	2003-05-16

I have two quibbles with the book.  I think the early section covering pre-Bronze Age civilization could have been shorter, as much of the analysis is of necessity overly speculative.  I was also slightly disappointed with the tone of the work, which often read like a textbook: I felt as though I was reading lists of fun facts without theme or context, and I found myself mentally preparing lesson plans and hypothetical quizzes.

He was a steady diarist, an intelligent, thinking man, and his dedication in maintaining his diary through months and years of deprivation and abuse was a profound gift to us all.  After reading the facts concering Hitler's rise to power and its outcome, it is fascinating to see how these events were viewed by a German citizen and a Jew.  Klemperer makes it clear that those with open eyes knew the evil of the Nazis from the first, so that claiming ignorance after the war is a poor excuse.  On the other hand, he also shows how the Nazis consilidated their grip on power and played on the fears of the German people.  I found it particularly interesting how successful the Nazis were at playing up the communist menace;  how many times in Klemperer's diaries does someone state that the Nazis are tolerable because they are keeping out the communists, as though only those two choices were possible?  It is the little tidbits such as this, the thoughts of the Germans, gentile and Jew, as they marched toward their doom, that makes Klemperer's diary so fascinating.	2003-04-07

All of her novels to date center on a short period of time and a few characters facing an important juncture in their lives.  The action is fast-paced, the world-building is fascinating, and the focus is on telling an entertaining and compelling story.  This is perhaps my favorite of her novels, because I love the atmosphere:  19th century Vienna at its peak, ghouls, demons, wizards, and scheming men of power.  Fun!	2003-04-07
US	44404489	R3TWZNJL34XVBR	0865476543	85426275	Postmodern Pooh	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Witty, pointed, good-natured satire	Excellent skewering of a branch of academia that seems to set itself up for it.  Crews put a lot of work into these essays, which are clever, intelligent, and extremely funny.  He isn't nearly so vicious in his satire as many of his speakers (and their real-life counterparts) are in their literary-political maneuvering, but he exposes the void at the heart of much modern literary criticism where the work itself used to live. Pooh is as good as any other subject when the theory drives the criticism, which is why this book works so well.	2003-02-18
US	44404489	R292AQJ8GXZL86	0345404351	563194619	Betrayals	Books	5	15	16	N	N	A wonderfully twisted book.	I've read this book a few times, and it never fails to amuse me with its intricately woven stories, wicked satire, and twisted plots.  Perhaps it's not everyone's cup of tea (as other reviews have shown) but I loved the mix of 19th century convoluted plotting (a la Wilkie Collins or Palliser's own Quincunx) and send-ups of modern literary theory, in the form of a literary critic cum cult leader, and such luminaries as Jeffery Archer, seen here as an egotistical politician turned plagarist.  I am not a fan of books as puzzles, but this is no postmodern deconstruction of fiction;  it's just a funny take on a thematically linked short story collection.	2003-02-18

Also, there are an annoying amount of typos and grammatical errors in the book.  They don't interfere with information transfer, but they brought me up mentally every time I crossed one and they come across as unprofessional.  Those nits aside, this is an excellent discussion of past and current research on the effects of running on the human body and methods to maximize training and race performance.  Costill and Trappe discuss the physiology of elite runners vs. the untrained, safe and effective training methods, differences between male and female runners, and the effects on aging on performance.  An educational resource for runners at all levels.	2003-02-18

Rosengarten is very opinionated about food, which lends verve to his writing.  The recipes themselves are very good, reliable, and cover both classics and new treatments.  The combination of reference material on meat, grains, and veggies and the great recipes makes this cookbook a must-own for any kitchen.	2003-01-14
US	44404489	R27UKJ9K6SCOAY	0380818604	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Intelligent fun	Can anyone spin a smart, entertaining tale better than Louise Bujold?  When I want a fun read that contains a well-crafted plot, compelling characters, and quality writing, I turn to Bujold.  Chalion is a stand-alone novel that follows a war-weary (forcibly) retired soldier through the twists and turns of palace intrigue and one family's little domestic trouble (a multi-generational curse). If you need a break from the nth installment of the lastest epic, decade-spanning fantasy spectacular, this is the book for you.	2003-01-14

The dishes are fresh, simple, accessible.  Try the Green Olive Tapanade.  It takes about 10 minutes to make and was a huge hit.  I think it will be a great use for spring/summer basil.	2003-01-13

Each story is tightly written, with well-drawn characters and a crafty plot.  Best of all is the evil cackle in the author's voice which comes through loud and clear in each and every story.	2002-11-19

The characters inspire both sympathy and laughter, and following &quot;Inspector Dew&quot; as he stumbles his way through the investigation is hilarous and suspenseful.  The characters are deftly outlined, the plotlines neatly woven together, and the ironic narration is a pleasure.	2002-11-19

I'm thrilled when Bloom expresses more exactly than I can why I read. He champions the aesthetic appreciation of literature, a search for \\"transcendence of limits\\" (Western Canon), rather than treating literature as of value only as an ideological tool or a self-help program. The second reason I appreciate this book is because Bloom inspired me to read several works I wouldn't have read otherwise. For an introduction to The Crying of Lot 49, Miss Lonelyhearts, and the astounding Blood Meridian, I will always thank him.	2002-10-29

My husband and I love Ming Tsai's style of cooking. We were printing recipes off the Food TV site before this cookbook came out. So you can imagine our disappointment when we tried a few recipes out of this cookbook and found them riddled with typos, errors in ingredient amounts, and poor editing. The writer of the cookbook, Boehm (?), seems to have done slapdash work in the testing department: the translation of a restaurant-level preparation to that of the home cook is poor. We have had to do a great deal of juggling and rewrites to make the recipes come out right. <br />Ming, please hire a new collaborator for your next cookbook! Your recipes are too good to be messed up by poor editing!	2002-10-28

There is nothing more frustrating than to read about an exciting bread or dessert only to discover that the recipe wasn't carefully tested or has typos. Not a problem here. I have yet to find a miss in this book.  Every recipe comes out well, the instructions are clear but concise, and the recipes cover the range of classic baking.  The use of multiple bakers from the TV series ensures that all recipes were created by experts, but it's Greenspan who should really be commended for translating what are probably large-scale, commercial recipes to those sized for the home cook and to do so in a manner that balances giving sufficient but not overdone direction. I find myself unwilling to bake out of any other cookbook these days.	2002-10-28
US	44404489	R296W92MOLWIHR	0441009123	718327533	Chasm City	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Entertaining sophomore effort but rough around the edges.	I enjoyed reading Chasm City. It's a fun and inventive tale of a future human settlement fallen on hard times, and a man who doesn't know his own mind. I will definitely continue to read Reynolds' books as they come out. Nevertheless, like Revelation Space, this novel has some narrative foibles that detract from its overall success. A first person viewpoint is justified by the story, but it causes the author some hangups when he has to relate information to the reader without making  it clear whether the narrator is aware of the significance of what he sees. Then there is the extended diversion to visit Gideon (and, in flashback, the Calueche) that is of no importance to the development of the main story. The side trip ties in with Reynolds' overall worldbuilding and perhaps it will be  important in the next novel, but here it sits like an undigested lump in the last third of the book. <br />It's also never made clear how the man seen in the last  chapter of the book (and why the pointless framing device in that chapter?) became so much greater than the sum of his parts, which one would have thought was the point of the entire tale. <br />Neither of Reynolds' novels quite hold up to their promise, but both are worthy and worthwhile efforts.	2002-09-09
