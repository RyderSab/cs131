What is the Matrix?<br /><br />You've asked yourself this, time and time again.  You know there's something wrong with the world that you're living in- something doesn't work.  You feel like an alien.  You know there has to be something more than this.<br /><br />In this daring little book, Jake Horsley suggests that your intuitions might just be correct.  \\"Matrix Warrior\\" is a manual for living the life of a seeker- someone not looking for little spiritual thrills, but radical liberation.  Disguised as a pop culture tome, Horsley uses analogies from The Matrix and the literary works of Phillip K. Dick (a significant influence on the mythology of The Matrix) and the metaphysical storytelling of Carlos Castaneda to spin a battle plan for those who would wage war against the apparent world.  The author suggests that people can be divided into four categories- \\"humatons\\", or those who are asleep, \\"matrix warriors\\", those who know that there is more to life than they've been offered, \\"matrix sorcerers\\", those who are no longer under the control of the matrix and able to manipulate it to some extent, and \\"lucids\\"- people, like Neo, who are totally liberated from the matrix.  This book is about the first step- becoming a \\"matrix warrior\\", and preparing to take advantage of opportunities to \\"unplug\\"- those rare events in life when we are offered a way to radically change our circumstances and embrace a more authentic mode of being.  Along the way, there are digressions on ethics, metaphysics, futurism, and many other topics.  While the Castanedan influence is apparent, one uncredited (though obvious) influence is the work of Aleister Crowley, especially regarding the way of the will.<br /><br />There are some slight deficiencies- the author didn't seem to entirely \\"get\\" the later Matrix films- in fact, he doesn't seem to understand them at all (for a better grasp, listen to the commentary tracks on the DVDs themselves, where Cornel West and Ken Wilber spin an interesting glimpse at the deeper implications of the movies).  But other than that quibble, \\"Matrix Warrior\\" is an excellent little book, and well worth your time... if you want to take the red pill, and find out how deep the rabbit hole goes...ting glimpse at the deeper implications of the movies).

A highly respected academic and scholar of religion, Smith comes off, in his other works, as the soul of moderation (and by all accounts, he is).  Here we see a different side of Dr. Smith, however- for 167 all-too-brief pages, he takes the gloves off. <br /> <br />In \\"Forgotten Truth\\", Smith goes on the warpath.  His target?  All the \\"sacred cows\\" of modernity.  Neo-Darwinism?  Smash.  Materialist ontology?  Bash.  Progress?  Crash.  In their place, Smith creates a syncretic view of spiritual realities throughout history, and their basic structure- the psychic plane of the shamanistic \\"spirit world\\", the celestial realm of angels and archetypes, all the way up to absolute spirit- the Godhead, Sunyata, Brahma.  Contesting modernity's \\"reign of quantity\\", Smith insists on the superiority of hierarchies of quality. <br /> <br />Smith isn't always entirely convincing, but he does present a daring critique of materialism and neo-darwinism.  The appendix, on Stan Grof's LSD research, is also a worthwhile addition.	2005-07-29

I need insulin shots after even touching a volume of Chicken Soup for the Soul or any of Richard Bach's pablum. <br /> <br />Yet I enjoyed The Alchemist from beginning to end.  What gives? <br /> <br />The Alchemist is simply a joy to read, a Brazillian \\"Siddhartha\\".  The tale is spare but gripping, as any good fable should be.  While some of the messages of the story may be of dubious merit, one can't help but be pulled in by Santiago's journey, and even notice paralells in one's own life.  Unlike many \\"inspirational\\" novels, you aren't bombed with \\"profound cosmic insights\\"- in fact, the author seems to go out of his way to avoid presenting a lesson that is anything more than metaphorical. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for an afternoon's reading.

While the religion is in steep decline in Europe, conservative, literalist forms are on the rise in an America hungry for some spiritual depth.  Yet these forms also invite a great deal of disdain from seekers hungry for a faith that gives deep meaning without insulting their intelligence.<br /><br />Written almost sixty years ago, Alan Watts \\"Behold the Spirit\\" is as relevant today, if not moreso, than it was then.  Addressing the acute problems within both Catholicism (which is used loosely, including Orthodoxy and \\"High Church\\" protestants such as Episcopalians and Anglicans) and Protestantism, Watts chalks them up to an irrelevancy steming from the periods they evolved out of.  As Watts points out, the early Christianity of the bible, Paul, the Church Fathers, the Neoplatonists, and Augustine was the high wisdom of a dying civilization- Rome.  The Christianity of the medieval era was the literalist religion of a newly born Western civilization, while the Christianity of the Renaissance and modernity is the stripped-down moral faith of an adolescent civilization rebelling against it's roots.  In order to gain a wisdom appropriate for a mature civilization, Watts contends, we must look to the wisdom of other mature civilizations- the Christianity of the ancients, and the mystical wisdom of the Eastern religions.<br /><br />Watts goes on to discuss what a \\"nondual\\" Christianity and Christian mysticism would look like (\\"we must develop a Christian way of washing our hands\\"), the problems with philosophical modernity and Protestant moralism, and the issues of spiritual \\"monkey business\\"- thinking that we can attain sanctity by imitating forms rather than recognizing the spirit.<br /><br />Overall, an important contribution to modern theology, and a worthwhile, though quick, read.	2005-03-20

Herrigel, upon arriving in Japan, undertakes the study of Kyudo- Japanese Archery- under a master, who explains to him both the practical and spiritual principles of his archery style.  The book takes one through Herrigel's practice, his insights, and finally his tests for mastership. <br /> <br />A good book, if a bit thin (a bit over 100 pages) and Herrigel's romanticism and use of western terms might put off some readers, but overall a quality presentation of one westerner's experience with Kyudo.	2005-01-26

While \\"The Way: On the Way With a Contemporary Master\\" fits that bill, it is considerably lacking in many ways. <br /> <br />First off, the writing and editing are horrible and uninspiring, and Sgolastra is a downright uninteresting character- one who also manages to make his master, Alfredo, just as dull.  He gives an account of discovering Gurdjieff's books, being hooked up with Alfredo through a millitary contact, and then attending Alfredo's classes.  While there are frequently mentions of \\"exercises\\", little detail is given, and as time goes by, the Gurdjieff-esq Alfredo starts making odder and odder proclamations (such as the approach of a planet filled with alien beings that will be trading entities with Earth).  Throughout, other paths and orthodox faiths are belittled, and Alfredo is always ambiguous about the origins of his teaching (which are similiar to the \\"Fourth Way\\" of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky).  Much of the book reads like recruitment propaganda for the path, which is alternately referred to as \\"Alfredo's Work\\" or \\"The Way\\". <br /> <br />Unless you have a strong interest in neo-Gurdjieffian groups, skip this one.	2004-12-20

Known for his associations with G.I. Gurdjieff and his followers, as well as for claiming dubious titles, Shah is not above suspicion.  On the other hand, \\"The Sufis\\" shows another side to Shah- that of an eloquent popularizer of the often difficult concepts of Islamic mysticism.<br /><br />Shah's book is long, but far from dry.  He takes one through the lives and works of many famous Sufi masters, from ibn'Arabi, Jalaluddin Rumi, Hafez, Omar Khyyam, and others, and discusses the way their ideas penetrated Europe through Christian mystics and later scholars, and the similarities to other traditions (such as various forms of Hindu tantra and Zen).  He discusses the varied organization of Sufi orders, their masters and their practices.  Overall he provides a good introduction to the ideas of Sufism.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some weaknesses.  He repeatedly makes the insistence that Sufism is not Islamic, but pan-religious- and then tries to explain how other forms of mysticism are all varied corruptions of the Sufi tradition, in a rather condescending and none-too-persuasive manner.  Nor does he really explore the idea that Sufism itself is derived from other sources, but insists that it is a primordial tradition, and the sources that most orthodox scholars would say it is derived from are, in fact, derived from it- a dubious claim at best.  Despite these flaws however, it is, overall, a good overview for the casual reader.	2004-12-19

It is an anthology of excerpts and letters written by Jewish mystics through the ages, though with a notable concentration of Lurianic and Chasidic mystics (as their writings are the most accessable today). <br /> <br />Some of the most enjoyable parts included a letter attributed to the Baal Shem Tov (one of his few existant writings), a chapter from Maimonides' that explains the way to achieve prophethood (that gives lie to the idea that Maimonides was a rationalist foe of mysticism), a letter on the holiness of the Chasidic tzaddikim, and excerpts from the Zohar.  Also included is an introduction from religion writer Karen Armstrong, who discusses these testimonies in the context of the world's mystical traditions. <br /> <br />Overall, a solid introduction to the varieties of Jewish religious experience.	2004-12-15

Since the first of the Matrix films came out, there's been plenty of talk about the religious paralells in it- Neo as Christ, Trinity as Mary Magdelene, Morpheus as John the Baptist, Cypher as Judas, etc, and it's theme of death, resurrection, and liberation.  In The Gospel Reloaded, Seay tries to piece these together in a theologically consistent whole, but never seems to approach the matter with any depth. <br /> <br />While he discusses many interesting theological implications in The Matrix and it's sequels, there are many interesting points that he misses.  For instance, what is the significance of the Merovingian and Persephone?  (This is touched on, but never seriously looked at)  Who is the Architect?  What is the meaning of Trinity's death, return to life- and subsequent death?  And, most glaring of all, Seay tries to argue that Cypher is not only Judas, but the \\"Satan\\" figure of the movie as while- while never confronting what Agent Smith's role is in all of this.  On top of that, the author tries to see everything in terms of Joseph Campbell's \\"hero's journey\\", while ignoring the many implications of this story. <br /> <br />While I can tepidly recommend this book, I also recommend supplementing it with a few other resources- David Brin's article on The Matrix (as well as his articles on the hero's journey and it's implications in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings) at [...] and the commentary tracks available on the boxed DVD edition of the Matrix trilogy (with Ken Wilber and Cornel West)- Ken provides a unique spiritual interpretation of The Matrix which doesn't entirely correspond with that of Seay, but fuels much food for thought.	2004-12-01

Valerie Kirschenbaum has a big idea.  A really big idea.  And she wants to tell you that, over and over, in multiple colors and fonts. <br /> <br />The idea of Goodbye, Gutenberg is an interesting one- why do books have to be made the same old way- plain black serif fonts on white backgrounds, when we have the technology to do so much more today?  Historically, most documents were illuminated manuscripts- letters were written in distinct styles and multiple colors and intermingled with pictures, which did more than just illustrate- they were integral parts of the way in which the book communicated to the reader.  With reading on the decline, unable to compete with multimedia and TV, Kirschenbaum wonders why books shouldn't once again embrace this?  Pointing out the way in with hypertext and Powerpoint have become ubiquitous modes of communication with a similiar style (though unfortunately spending little time on magazines and their embrace of this style, or Japanese manga), Kirschenbaum advances her case by pointing out how dramatically performance in her classes improved when she reformatted classic literature using color and special fonts. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, while the case is powerful and well-intentioned, the book is flawed.  The two main problems are both Kirschenbaum's writing style and her breathless, self-absorbed attitude.  She writes like a high school teacher- you always have a feeling that she's talking down to you, and the tone of the whole thing smacks of a 9th grade textbook.  Not the writing of which revolutions are made.  On top of that, Kirschenbaum fills her book with a sort of breathlessly egotistical, \\"look at me, I'm so clever, I'm going to change the world\\" attitude that is well-intentioned yet gets quite tiring.  Few authors who actually create revolutions set out with that intention- and usually those who set out with that intention fail miserably. <br /> <br />That aside though, it's a worthy effort on Kirschenbaum's part, and I wish her success.  Maybe my first book will be in color, rather than dreary old black and white...	2004-11-28

As I've watched America try to establish liberal, democratic governments around the world, both today and during the cold war, and repeatedly fail, I keep wondering to myself- why is it easier to establish an authoritarian or totalitarian state than a democracy?  And why does democracy so frequently go wrong? <br /> <br />Here, in \\"The Future of Freedom\\", Fareed Zakaria, best known for his columns and articles in Foreign Policy and Newsweek magazines, explains what everyone has been missing- the problem isn't just economics (otherwise the rich oil countries of the Middle East would be as liberal as Sweden), intellectual traditions, or insidious ideologies- the most significant problem is the lack of liberal institutions, such as a fair legal system, that make both democracy and capitalism possible.  Only when a country establishes these, and builds an economy on it's own ingenuity (rather than resource wealth or handouts from the international community), can it truly be ready for liberal democracy.  To Zakaria, this explains why Chile, South Korea, Japan, and Spain have succeeded in creating liberal democracies, whereas nations like India, Iraq, Egypt, and much of the former Soviet Union have failed or are failed.   <br /> <br />In addition to his critiques of authoritarian nations, though, Zakaria turns his attentions to problems with democracy in America as well- and threats from both the right and the left.  On the left, he points out the problems with California and their \\"government by referendum\\", which has emasculated the state government in Sacramento and left them powerless to adjust the budget or deal with crises.  On the right, he decries the fall of traditional elites in America, and the rise of ad-hoc populist elites- especially the Christian right, which in his eyes mirrors the worst excesses of their liberal cousins (Jerry Falwell- Religion as Mass Marketing, Pat Robertson- Religion as Feel-Good Therapy, The Bakers- Religion as Hedonism).  Rather than fortifying morality, the abandonment of traditional elite virtues and the \\"high churches\\" in favor of a mass populist approach to social morals and the demagoguery of religious figures is endangering American democracy at it's roots.  These threats, from both sides of the spectrum, need to be held in check both here and abroad. <br /> <br />A powerful, popular book from Zakaria- as a fan of his columns, I hope to see more such books from him.  And who knows, maybe he'll be the first Indian Muslim-American to be Secretary of State...	2004-11-28

Jewish mysticism is a popular topic these days, especially with the controversy over Hollywood's fascination with the topic.  In Jewish Mysticism: An Introduction, Laenen cuts through the pop Kabbalism and delves into this highly esoteric subject. <br /> <br />The first section of the book covers the earliest Jewish mystics, the Merkavah Riders, who were influenced by the neoplatonists and gnostics, and continues into a study of pre and post-Zoharic Kabbalah, the tradition typically thought of as Jewish mysticism today, as well as the 12th and 13th century German Hasids (not to be confused with the later Hasidic movement).  From there, Laenen explores Isaac Luria's exposition of the Kabbalah and his messianism, which paved the way for the rise of false messiah Sabbatai Zevi, who started a mass movement in the Ottoman Empire that would be felt even until the early 20th century.  The book concludes with a discussion of the Baal Shem Tov and Hasidism's rise, a brief overview of the Hebrew traditions of \\"langauge mysticism\\", and a chapter on popular books and authors to avoid (paying special attention to Christian and Hermetic occultists, who have their own distinct brand of Kabbalistic lore). <br /> <br />Overall, this is a strong, easy to follow introduction to the history of Jewish mysticism, with a brief introduction to the metaphysics of Jewish mysticism.  It is not, however, a guide to practice of any sort, and doesn't delve extensively into the metaphysics of the Kabbalah or Merkava materials.	2004-11-18

Taylor is an important voice in today's philosophical community- one that refuses to give in to the excesses of either postmodern relativism or extreme conservatism.  Instead, with \\"Sources of the Self\\", (expanding on \\"The Ethics of Authenticity\\"), he's written an important summary of the evolution of moral ideas from the ancient virtue-hierarchies of the Greeks, through the communitarian great chain of medieval philosophy, to the independent \\"I\\" of modernity.  In doing so, he explains the strengths of modern ethics: <br /> <br />-the \\"hypergoods\\" of liberty, equality, and freedom of expression. <br /> <br />-the \\"sanctification\\" of ordinary life (esp. as it stems from the Protestant reformation) <br /> <br />-the pursuit of scientific inquiry and it's benefits to modern life. <br /> <br />He also, however, points out the problems that occur when modernity's \\"focus\\" on the self turns into the narcissistic \\"obsession\\" with self of the Romantics and postmodernists. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to philosophical liberals as one of the best defenses of modern liberalism in print, to scholars of philosophy as an important history of the evolution of the idea of the self, and to fans of the works of Jurgen Habermas and Ken Wilber, both of whom also deal extensively with issues tackled in this book.	2004-11-09

Stoyanov, in \\"The Hidden Tradition in Europe\\", does just this- he lays out a definitive history of dualist movements in western religion, from the dawn of dualism in ancient Persia with Zoroaster, through the Greek Dualists (the Orphic Mysteries), and syncretic and gnostic Christian movements that managed to penetrate the far corners of both Europe and Asia- the Manicheans. <br /> <br />From here, Stoyanov traces how Manicheanism developed into the French Cathar and Bulgarian Bogomil movements of the middle ages, and how the rise and fall of these movements was dictated by the imperial politics of medieval europe and the tensions between Christianity and Islam, the former of which was under constant threat of annihilation by the forces of the latter, and how Dualist movement represented a security threat to Christendom. <br /> <br />The book concludes with a brief discourse on Bogomil and Cathar theology and cosmology- the two sons of god (Samael-Satan and Michael-Christ), the degrees of initiation among the dualists, and a brief overview of their morality. <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend this book highly to anyone with a great interest in the history of heresy and \\"alternative\\" Christianity, as well as dualist foundations in neoplatonic and western thought in general.	2004-10-17

Lloyd's \\"Anatomy of Neoplatonism\\" expecting a good, solid introduction to Neoplatonic thought.  I'd read a bit of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius, but I wanted a more general \\"overview\\" of Neoplatonism that would help better explain many of the concepts and tie together the various strands of Neoplatonic thought (Not only Plotinus and Ps-Dionysius, but Iamblichus, Proclus, Boetheus, Ammonius Saccas, and the Renaissance Neoplatonists as well). <br /> <br />This is not the book. <br /> <br />\\"Anatomy of Neoplatonism\\" is, for someone not already thoroughly steeped in ancient philosophy, extremely dense and nearly incomprehensible.  I just finished a major in Philosophy, and I still could barely make heads or tails of this book- it meanders, it makes few points, and is about as much fun to read as Kant.  Aristotle's \\"De Anima\\" was much more comprehensible than this work. <br /> <br />At the same time, however, I can't really give this book a bad review, as it could be very valuable to the specialist- I have no way to judge.

While I found many of their arguments quite convincing, something just didn't quite sit right with me. <br /> <br />Taylor explained exactly what's wrong with such critiques- they ignore the fact that \\"relativism\\" is merely a perversion of a powerful moral standard that these conservatives ignore- the ethic of authenticity, of being true to one's self and to the rights of others, a liberal standard of the enlightenment that conservatives threaten to destroy along with the excesses of postmodern nihilism.  Taylor then goes on a quest to take down both the \\"boosters\\" and \\"knockers\\" of modernity- and points out where they're right and wrong. <br /> <br />For anyone wrestling with the liberal and conservative debates in this country today, I recommend this little volume heartily, along with Taylor's (much larger) \\"Sources of the Self\\" and Ken Wilber's \\"Sex, Ecology, Spirituality: The Spirit of Evolution\\", which takes on the same issues from multiple perspectives.	2004-10-12

While there's still a lot of terminology to digest, and Wilber drops more than a few names that non-academics probably won't recognize, Wilber does manage to strip his philosophy down to a brief introduction that is far more elegant and feels like less of an abridgement than \\"A Brief History of Everything\\". <br /> <br />At the same time, I don't know if Wilber succeeds in pulling off the mission of the book- \\"Integrating Science and Religion.\\"  While Wilber does a fine job of defining science and the limits of science, his definition of religion throws out the very components of religion that are most relevant to the typical religious believer!  He strips religion down to meditative contemplation, while rendering the other components of religion irrelevant to his model.  Ultimately, his \\"integration\\" is only possible by redefining religion into his model.  While Wilber's philosophy is powerful and coherent, (and hence I'm not ashamed to admit to being a \\"Wilberian\\") his explaining-away of religion makes the own purpose of his book impossible.  You might as well ask Richard Dawkins (the famously atheistic evolutionary biologist) to write a book on the integration of science and religion- it would be just as unsatisfactory.  <br /> <br />Despite this, however, the book does do an excellent job of presenting integral theory to a broader audience.  As a companion volume, I'd recommend Robert Wright's \\"Nonzero\\" as another fine book on the integral vision.	2004-10-09

Here, in one of his earliest works, he takes on Spinoza's Theologico-Political Treatise, the very root of the enlightenment critique of religious revelation. <br /> <br />According to Strauss, Spinoza's critique is rooted in the prior philosophical work of Maimonides, da Costa, and Hobbes.  Unlike Maimonides, who tries to reconcile reason and faith, or Hobbes, who believes in the necessity of a \\"religious lie\\" for political control, Spinoza believes that man can live by reason alone.  According to Strauss, Spinoza's critique is flawed- though the philosopher can live without revelation, revelation is a necessity for the populous at large.  Strauss evaluates Spinoza's critiques of both Christianity and Judaism, as well as where his philosophy intersects and diverges from Calvinism- the major trend of theological thought in the Netherlands during Spinoza's own time. <br /> <br />A valuable book for students of philosophy, politics, and anyone trying to understand the origins of our modern separation between church and state.	2004-10-07

I enjoy odd, dark fantasy works (Gaiman and Moorcock, for instance), cyberpunk fiction (esp. Stephenson and Gibson), and the Final Fantasy videogame series, so I'm apparently the target audience for Mieville's pseudo-literary monstrosity.  Yet, for some reason, I couldn't help but find it a yawner. <br /> <br />Mieville starts off strong.  New Crobuzon, the Dickensian London meets neo-Tokyo setting of the novel, is an endlessly thought-provoking locale.  Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin is a fascinating, multi-dimensional character- a large, middle aged, black academic-turned-bohemian who talks like a cockney, messes with bizzare occult theories, and carries on an illicit relationship with a giant sentient insect... how could he not be interesting?  The initial set-up is wonderful, the pseudo-scientific research interesting, the politics captivating... <br /> <br />Then the book hits a brick wall, as a great fantasy-suspense novel suddenly morphs into a boring monster hunt. <br /> <br />Mieville can't write an action scene to save his life (a trait he shares with Neil Stephenson).  Half of the time I had no idea what was going on in a conflict, and the other half of the time I was wondering what had just occured.  The interesting characters and plot development are suddenly lost in a sea of muddled carnage as the entire story collapses under it's own weight, and straight into the cardboard cutout background.   <br /> <br />\\"Perdido Street Station\\" is all image, all superficiality, no substance.  While Mieville tries to project the image that there is a massive, developed world sitting behind this novel, his ruse doesn't last long before it is revealed for what it is.  Unlike Tolkien, whose stories rested on the depth of detail already inherent in his fictional universe, or Moorcock, with his prodigious writing talents, Mieville is quickly revealed for the poseur that he is.  Behind the mish-mash of mythic themes, japanese videogames, 19th century literature and gonzo occultism, there's ultimately no coherent vision other than an \\"anything goes\\" punk nihilism and Mieville's whiny Marxist politics (which all too often rears it's ugly head in the seemingly endless paeans to \\"equality\\" and the \\"plight of the workers\\").  At least Cyberpunk has political relevance- Mieville's \\"steampunk\\" is nothing but an attempt at cashing in on anti-Tolkien sentiments and ripoffs of Hiro Sakaguchi's techno-fantasy epics. <br /> <br />Of course, all that out, the book is not without it's merits.  For fans of \\"dark fantasy\\", Perdido Street Station is a smorgasboard of imagery, lovingly crafted by Mieville's mad toymaker's eye for the bizzare.  The first half is very promising, and shows what Mieville could be capable if he quit grinding his stylistic axe and wrote a real novel. <br /> <br />So, in final analysis, if you're a fan of the Final Fantasy or Arcanum video games, the Planescape or Eberron RPG settings, or Gibson and Sterling's \\"The Difference Engine\\", dig in, but don't expect to dig far.	2004-08-21

A few years ago, when I first began to read in mystical and occult topics,  I mused about the possibility of a \\"code\\" within human DNA that had mystical correspondences, or a mystical code that could be used to modify human genes in a way that would advance the human species.  Driven by some of the funny correspondences I noted- the superficial similiarities between the DNA double helix, Hermetic Caduceus, and the Qabalistic Tree of Life, and the four-letter name of God (YHWH) and the four base pairs of genetic code (ATGC), I pondered it, then shelved it as I lacked the expertise in both biochemistry and Qabalah to do such a project justice. <br /> <br />Gregg Braden, an engineer and \\"scholar\\" of mysticism seemed to have pondered the very same thing, written a book on the subject (badly), and intertwined it with yet another sermon on world peace.   <br /> <br />Most of the book consists of a commentary on the Sepher Yetzirah, the Qabalistic \\"Book of Formation\\".  One of the things that amused me most about Braden is his repeated claims that he has traveled all over the world reading \\"rare\\" texts to gain this information, when he never once references a mystical text that I don't already have an english translation of sitting on my bookshelf!  Thus Braden combines both his shoddy, illogical, and superstitious thought-process with outright lies about his sources.  On top of that, he has few enlightening correspondences to point out that a layman with a basic college biology text and a copy of Dion Fortune's \\"Mystical Qabalah\\" couldn't figure out in a few hours of qabalistic \\"analysis\\". <br /> <br />Save your money- buy a real book on Christian mysticism (Smoley's \\"Inner Christianity\\" is a good start) or Robert Wright's \\"Nonzero\\" (probably the best account of human destiny on the market, and far better than Braden's drivel).	2004-08-18

He'll stun you with the secret methods Jesus used to contact God and spread peace and love into the world!  He'll wow you with his access to 45 lost books of the bible and their amazing revelations!  You'll be an instant saint, overnight!<br /><br />Not quite.  Braden's \\"lost mode of prayer\\" is just a typical guided meditation of the kind often used by teachers, therapists, and ministers.  His 45 lost books are commonly available apocryphal and gnostic texts that you can purchase at any Barnes and Noble.  His amazing revelations may startle someone who's entire exposure to religion consists of mainline protestantism, but for someone who already has a background in mysticism, meditation, or the occult, his methods just look silly.<br /><br />Despite all this, Braden has a pleasant, teacher-like voice, and does deliver a soothing meditation walk-through.  I have the CD version, and sometimes I just listen to the last track, just to skip right to the guided prayer- the rest of the recording is worthless.  Despite this, I would still say it isn't worth the money, though it might not be a bad disk to pull out of a discount bin somewhere.	2004-08-18

For decades, there has been a war in fantasy- a war between the conservative fantasists of the tradition of Tolkien, and the radicals of the party of Mervyn Peake- a war that seems to have no resolution.  Moorcock, Spinrad, Mieville, R.A. Wilson, and a host of nonconformists have turned out piles of fiction that, while often highly creative, is all-too-often weird for weirdness' sake.  On the other hand, Eddings, Jordan, G.R.R. Martin, Hickman, Salvatore, and others have boldly defended the tradiitonalist camp, cranking out the same story, over and over, with subtle modifications here and there, and the same powerful archetypal themes replayed.<br /><br />Like the main character of his own novel, Shadow, Neil Gaimon has stepped into the fray, and boldly declared that the war is over.  And there never was a war in the first place.<br /><br />\\"American Gods\\" is a boldly inventive modern fantasy that takes an ex-convict named Shadow and puts him under the wing of the mysterious Mr. Wednesday- Odin's American avatar, a warrior-god reduced to con artistry and nostalgia for the good ol' days of bloodbaths and human sacrifice.  Taking Shadow on a road trip through the midwest (and elsewhere), one meets a pantheon of traditional spirits, gods, and heroes- ranging from Anansi and Eostre to leprechauns and dwarves, Weskejak and Jonny Appleseed, and even a visit to Thoth and Anubis- all of whom have found their own unique little niche in the American landscape.  Along the way, Shadow discovers their rivals... the new gods of technology, TV, the media, and government, all working towards the elimination of the old spirits and their ways.  Behind all this hallucinogenic splendor, however, is a classic fantasy tale of destiny discovered, history repeated, and a redemptive savior in the most unlikely form.  The question, \\"Can there be peace between the old gods and the new?\\", is almost an allegory for the battle for the soul of the fantasy genre- \\"Can there be peace between the classic fantasists and the new rebels?\\"<br /><br />You can hang on Yggdrasil until you find the answer- or you can read the novel.

One of the oldest tasks of philosophy is to gain an understanding of what the &quot;soul&quot; is, and it's nature.  Ever since Aristotle wrote the treatise we know as the &quot;De Anima&quot;, philosophers have haggled over this question.<br />Hameed Ali (known here by his pen name A.H. Almaas) has now thrown his hat into this ancient ring, with mixed results.  &quot;The Inner Journey Home&quot; purports to explain the nature of the soul and how it  develops, yet gets lost in a tangled web of Sufism, German Existentialism, and orthodox psychology without ever really getting to the point.  For 500 pages, Almaas goes off on tangents that could have been summed up in 20, endlessly repeating the same themes using different terminology.  The reader quickly gets bogged down in distinctions and terms that make absolutely no sense without some frame of reference- which is provided by Ali's other books, to which he constantly refers.  There are some interesting and unique points (such as his discussions of the archetypal &quot;diamond vehicles&quot;), yet these quickly get lost in the repetitive maze built by Almaas' circular philosophizing.  Unlike similiar writers, like Ken Wilber, there really isn't much use for Almaas' philosophy- it's mostly Heideggerian navel-gazing.  The most useful section of the book, in fact, are the appendixes, in which Almaas compares his developmental theory to that of Wilber, Washburn, and Grof, and also analyzes western, easter, and sufi concepts of the soul, as well as early childhood spiritual development.<br />Overall, while my opinion may be biased by the fact that I've never read any of Almaas' other works, I found his philosophy lacking in utility, repetetive, and incoherent, and his insights into the nature of the soul could be better summed up by Eckhart Tolle in a few sentences than Almaas manages in his entire book.  If you want a coherent &quot;integral&quot; philosophy, Ken Wilber or Stanislav Grof are still the way to go.	2004-06-09

No, he can't shoot fireballs out of his arse or rise from the dead (as far as I know).  But he's got the secret- and the secret is awareness.<br />&quot;The Power of Now&quot; repackages traditional spiritual teachings in a format that even a skeptic can digest without too much discomfort.  Essentially, Tolle's entire message boils down to this- all of our major problems are caused by our lack of awareness and attention.  By keeping ourselves focused on the present and upon our body, rather than projecting into time with our mind, we can overcome our conflicts and create a saner world for ourselves and others.<br />Tolle isn't a fluffy &quot;white-lighter&quot;, however.  He's painfully aware of how sick and insane humanity is, and doesn't appear to have any illusions of how hard a task the one he presents is.  He simply presents an honest glimpse at the true nature of reality, in a manner that the Buddha, Bodhidharma, and Ramana Maharshi would certainly agree with.  At the very least, Tolle has written one of the clearest guides to overcoming depression and existential angst ever written.<br />I can't recommend it enough- The Power of Now is a book that anyone should read.  It can only help.	2004-05-20

And, while he does an admirable job in presenting a real glimpse at world opinion (they love America and what it stands for; they just hate the arrogance of our government), the book gets bogged down in Hertsgaard's own rants against the perceived hypocrisy of America.<br />Despite this weakness, he does make some valid points.  Americans are extremely parochial, we tend to ignore the rest of the world (with the exception of western Europe and whoever we are currently bombing), and generally very wasteful.  We espouse a bizzarely schizophrenic type of politics that tries to simultaneously emphasize &quot;family values&quot; and &quot;community&quot; while supporting a soulless economic system that conspires to tear our values apart.  At the same time, Hertsgaard doesn't really offer any solutions of his own other than the usual critiques and tepid support for social democracy (which has worked quite poorly in France, Germany, and Japan according to most economists)<br />The writing is fluid and extremely readable, which makes the book fly by at a quick pace. He has many delightful anecdotes from his travels that liven up the report and help highlight his observations... let little real reporting.  In general, the book falls slightly flat.<br />Final appraisal?  If you're looking for a quick read for a vacation, you can do far worse.  For real global journalism, however, I'd recommend reading a work by a better reporter, such as Thomas Friedman or Fareed Zakaria.<br />(As for me, I got my copy for free.  Hertsgaard spoke at my campus, and bet the audience that none of the students could name the prime minister of Japan.   I was the only one who could name Junichiro Koizumi... a sad state of affairs, given that I was surrounded by Political Science students, who should know the head of the second largest economy in the world.  At least I recieved a signed copy of The Eagle's Shadow for being the only one.)	2004-03-16

Ken Wilber's \\"Sex, Ecology, Spirituality: The Spirit of Evolution\\", is my favorite book.  And that isn't a title I award lightly.<br />SES is quite possibly the first attempt at putting together a syncretic, evolutionary worldview since Hegel's \\"Phenomenology\\".  In an age when truth has been declared dead and multiple perspectives rule the roost, where philosophy lives in the shadow of Nietzsche's madman, Wilber, in this striking volume, challenges post-modernity.  Unlike other challengers, arguing for a retreat to conservatism and cynical (or mythic-literal) traditionalism, Ken proposes a different idea- we need to integrate the strengths of Post-modernity (a recognition of the other, a bird's eye view of ideology, and a profound social and ecological awareness), Modernity (scientific rationality, empiricism, democracy), and Pre-modernity (religious wisdom and cultural bounty) into one complete, \\"integral\\" package.<br />Sounds like a tough mission for any thinker to take on.  Of course, Wilber- living outside the academia, blending his scholastic persuits with Zen practice, and doing his best to live his own philosophy- is no ordinary thinker.  In the 551 pages of text (not including extensive endnotes and bibliography), Wilber essentially lays out his \\"theory of everything\\".  Based in the psychological work of Freud, Piaget, Kohlberg, Maslow, Jung, Gebser, and other thinkers, Wilber first constructs a socio-psychological map of civilization's evolution to date, and shows how it integrates with hard scientific data.  Dividing the world into subject and object, Wilber shows how modern empiricism has attempted to colonize the subjective sphere by trying to render it irrelevant- a condition he refers to as \\"flatland\\".  After providing this analysis, Wilber takes a gander at the cognitive structures still lying in our future, through several examples of such advanced minds- Emerson, St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila, Ramana Maharshi, and Meister Eckhart.  After that, Wilber takes on the disease of the Post-modern world and it's primary culprits- a dissociation between what he refers to as the  \\"Eco\\" camps (romantic, back-to-nature, web-of-life, holistic) and the \\"Ego\\" camps (rationalistic, modernistic, atomistic, disassociating the mind and body), and how these two contradictory (and self-contradictory) worldviews are becoming extremely destructive- in political discourse, academia, and the world in general.<br />Of course, as has been said before about SES, it's very hard to sum up in a simple outline- the book itself is practically a 500+ page outline.  The main thrust of the work is to construct a coherent philosophy for the 21st century, and thus Wilber spends little time on details (which will be covered further in the next two volumes, Kosmic Karma and Creativity and The Spirit of Post-Modernity).  But, that weakness aside, Wilber has proven himself the finest philosophical mind of the early 21st century, and the first great step beyond Foucault, Derrida, and the rest of the post-modern mess.<br />Although SES is an excellent book, it's not light reading, and readers without a background in philsophy, psychology, or cultural studies should take a look at a simpler introduction to Wilber's work, such as A Brief History of Everything- the condensed, more conversational version of SES.	2004-02-05

Although they were his only three novels in the decade, they bore a cultural relevance that went far beyond Stephenson's less than prolific output- the first novel echoed the uncertainties of a post-cold war world on the verge of a new revolution, the second echoed the heady optimism of a time of dramatic technological and sociopolitical change, and the third betrayed a keen grasp of how dark the day after tomorrow could be.  It seemed that Stephenson, with his amazing skill at twisting ideas, humor, and a certain measure of info-age prophecy together, could do no wrong.<br />With &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, Stephenson hath known sin- and it doesn't look good on him.<br />Quicksilver is, to be perfectly honest, too long.  The pacing of &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; made it fly by- Quicksilver is an endless trudge into an ever more byzantine (or should I say baroque?) web of characters, subplots, and trivia that would put a Robert Jordan novel to shame.  While still humorous, much of Stephenson's forked tongue gets lost in the minutae of the book... and the relevance of the novel doesn't seem immediately apparent.  Stephenson's epic ends up being a huge, messy cludge of history and characters thrown together in such an inelegant manner that one loses track of the story at it's heart.<br />However, while I am disappointed in &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, it is not without it's merits.  The first third of the novel is truly excellent, his main characters are quite interesting, and &quot;meeting&quot; various figures from the 17th and 18th centuries is a joy in of itself.  While my critiques of the book remain, a true evaluation of this work remains impossible without reading the two remaining volumes- which, at the time of this review, have not yet been released.<br />All in all, unless you're a major 17th century European history buff, I'd suggest waiting until the second and third volumes are released before deciding whether or not to pay the cost of admission.	2003-12-18

Hegel has long been known as being an incomprehensible German philosopher, much like his predecessor Kant, and many others who followed, such as Heidegger and Husserl- sure to confound the casual reader and give even dedicated students headaches.  In Hegel: Text and Commentary, famed translator and philosopher Walter Kaufmann, who so skillfully cleansed Nietzsche's bad name after the fallout of WW II, attempts to provide running commentary on Hegel's Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit, which attempts to introduce Hegel's philosophy in a readable manner.<br />Kaufmann's notes are helpful in deciphering Hegel's work, but they still fall a bit short, at least for the casual reader.  Unlike the eminently readable Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Kierkegaard, Hegel, even with a good translator and guide, is still very difficult material.  I'd recommend that anyone studying Hegel's philosophy without prior knowledge of his system also pick up a copy of Fichte's &quot;Vocation of Man&quot;, the direct predecessor to Hegel's work.  Fichte's philosophy provides the foundation for understanding Hegel's, and makes deciphering his dense prose decidedly easier.	2003-09-12

Little did I know that this film would become one of my favorite movies ever.  Finally, a week ago, now well into my college career, I decided to pick up the novel (after reading several of Palahniuk's other works).<br />The first half of the movie and the first half of the book match up pretty well.  The second half diverts, and the endings are completely different.<br />The novel, Fight Club, is essentially a retelling of Faust- one searches for material goods, then knowledge, and then power in a search for fulfillment that can't be had at any price.  This state is brought about by the denial of the feminine, portrayed, in this book, by two characters- Bob Paulson and Marla Singer, who could be seen as the mirror for Gretchen, whereas Tyler Durden takes the Mephistophelian role.  Whereas the movie ultimately culminates in a brutally ironic (and chillingly prophetic) strike against consumerism, the anti-consumerism of the novel is more of an afterthought, the book having more to do with man's denial of himself and the inability to become a hero without pain.<br />While Palahniuk's best novel to date is &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot; will be the one he's remembered for- a glance into the empty souls of early information-age yuppies, combined with a timeless, existential look at humanity.	2003-09-12

This is Chuck Palahniuk writing a good, but not great, novel.<br />After Palahniuk revolutionized the postmodern novel with Fight Club (also a fantastic movie) and his follow-up, the tragicomic Survivor, he seemingly ran out of steam- Choke, his fourth novel, turned out to be a dull, formulaic piece that showed little of his previous innovation.  He made a partial recovery with Lullaby, which mixed his existential sensibilities with a dash of Stephen King style supernaturalism, but didn't quite hit the depths of outrageous nihilism that marked his earlier successes.  Diary is another work in a similiar vein to Lullaby- creative, enjoyable to read, yet not on the level of Fight Club or Survivor.<br />In Diary, the tale of a burned-out ex-artist, her comatose husband, and a sinisterly comedic conspiracy to save a decaying old-money resort town, Palahniuk continues his postmodern revival of the early gothic mystery.  Early gothic works, written in a time when science promised to answer age-old questions of meaning and cast off the veil of the supernatural, were characterized by sinister horrors that, when exposed to the light of reason, turned out to be nothing but tricks of the mind.  Palahniuk's twist on the tradition is to add a sense of irony- what was sinister and supernatural ultimately turns out to be ridiculous, trite, and reek of bourgeoise inanity.  In addition, Palahniuk, who's taken on the banality of office life and the self-deceptive certainty of religious life, now takes on the life of the artist- one, throughout history, characterized by pain, hardship, sickness, and a drive to escape.  In addition to writing a thoroughly enjoyable novel, Palahniuk gives an insightful look at the nature of art and it's relation to fear- a relationship well known to any true artist, Palahniuk included.<br />While not revolutionary in the way Fight Club or Survivor was, Diary is another excellent novel by Palahniuk, and well worth reading.  His social criticism is in fineform, and his writing maintains it's gripping style.  Diary is not to be missed, especially by those of an artistic persuasion.	2003-09-01

His biographers have all come away with different pictures of the man, and even his own autobiography does little to clear the air.  In &quot;The Eye in the Triangle: An Interpretation of Aleister Crowley&quot;, Israel Regardie, a student under the old magician, slices through the perplexities of his character with a shrewd, psychoanalytically based eye.<br />Regardie does more than address the neurosis and flaws in Crowley's character structure, however- as a student of mysticism, he dives into an investigation of Crowley's system of &quot;Thelemic Magick&quot;, it's basis in the esoterica of the Golden Dawn, India, the Ordo Templi Orientis, and the Sacred Magic of Abramelin, and how this influenced his character and development.  Regardie discusses philosophy, yoga, several schools of psychoanalytic thought (including that of the controversial Wilhelm Reich), and western ceremonial magic, all with a very readable style.  The book is more than an analysis of Crowley- it is an analysis of how Crowley's investigations give us insight into the entire structure of the character of western man and the changes we're experiencing in the postmodern world.<br />I highly recommend this book- it should be on the bookshelf of every student of Transpersonal psychology.	2003-08-30

Following up Salvatore's &quot;The Spine of the World&quot;, it's no suprise that he's decided to write another novel focusing on a character other than Drizzt.  What's different, this time around, is that the character chosen is none other than Drizzt's archnemesis, Artemis Entreri, now battling for control over the Crystal Shard (and his life) and matching wits with Jarlaxle, the enigmatic drow mercenary.<br />As always, Salvatore spins an enjoyable tale, and he continues the more intriguing plotlines that are the hallmark of &quot;mature Salvatore&quot;- his writings from Legacy of the Drow on.  No longer content just to regurgitate the same stories of his predecessors, Salvatore engages the reader with a far more intelligent story.  He rises above the pack of &quot;shared world&quot; fiction with refreshing style- one can tell that Salvatore enjoys writing his novels as much as his readers enjoy reading them.<br />All in all, another fine book.  Hopefully Drizzt is in the next one!	2003-08-23

Scarred and defeated, he's turned to the bottle, working as a bouncer in a seedy tavern in Luskan, the city of sail, until he's arrested for a crime he didn't commit.  This turn of events sets in motion a quest, leading not to gold or slain dragons, but to Wulfgar's own redemption from his tortured past.<br />Interestingly enough, Wulfgar's battle with guilt is punctuated by a subplot involving a peasant girl's similiar struggles with lies and betrayal that end up sweeping Wulfgar into a tangled web of love and jealousy.  The Spine of the World seems to mark a continuation of the more mature, less predictable storylines that Salvatore has been working on since Legacy of the Drow- a positive change in the all-to-often hackeneyed genre of shared-world fantasy.<br />Another strong book from Salvatore- pick it up, it's a quick read, and a worthwhile one at that.	2003-08-15

It was going to be a fantasy that wasn't a fantasy, a hard sci-fi novel about agents of a transhuman &quot;god&quot; trying to bring down another such entity on a backwards planet impregnated with nanotechnology that seemed like magic to it's primitive inhabitants.<br />Karl Schroeder beat me to it.<br />This book is, to say the least, fantastic.  Schroeder blends Vinge-esque transhuman themes and nanotechological &quot;fantasy realism&quot; with a coming-of-age quest reminiscient of Robert Jordan's &quot;Eye of the World&quot;. (I have a suspicion that it's more than just coincidence that the main character's name is Jordan)  Thrown into the plot are interesting characters- transhuman assassins, a cyborg demigod, noblemen and royalty who can communicate telepathically with nanotech devices, a sentient starship, a cosmopolitan anthropologist, and more, thrown together in a mission that could decide the fate of the galaxy.  Schroeder's intense, fast pace writing style echoes the best cyberpunk, while never succumbing to that genre's attitude.  Best of all, the last section of the book explores an interesting philosophical discussion of the relationship between man, science, and nature, one that will hopefully provoke dialogue between environmentalists and transhumanists alike.<br />All in all, a fantastic book, and a worthwhile read for science fiction and fantasy fans alike.	2003-08-15

Wilson's &quot;Cosmic Trigger: The Final Secret of the Illuminati&quot; was a fascinating look at the events leading up to the writing of the classic Illuminatus! Trilogy.  An intriguing look at relativism in literature and reality, the first Cosmic Trigger delightfully wove acid, Uncle Al, and conspiracy theories into a head-trip of &quot;cosmic&quot; proportions.  Wilson's follow-up, unfortunately, fails to break any new ground.<br />Cosmic Trigger II is an interesting little book, and fun to read in these times of Bush II (Son of Huge Berserk Rebel Warthog? Or Insane Anglo Warlord reborn?).  Wilson delves into his childhood, his education, his time in Ireland, his visit to communist East Germany, and yet another fold in his conspiracies- the Knights of Malta and their connections to fascists, the Mob, and the Republican Party.<br />All in all, CT II is a fun read, but nothing exceptional.  If you spy a cheap copy in a used book bin, pick it up for a morning read, but otherwise don't bother.	2003-08-12

It is filled with admirable characters, dastardly villains, good vs. evil, and everything that makes a good fantasy.<br />And that's precisely the problem with it.<br />If Ayn Rand was attempting to write a politico-philosophical novel in a similiar vein to Huxley or Orwell, she failed miserably.  If her goal was to write a piece of absolutist propaganda, she succeeded- which contradicted the entire idea she was trying to express!  Rand defeats libertarianism by turning it into an absolutist ideology based on iron-shod moral axioms and a single-minded devotion to endless material acquisition as the singular most important goal in life.  Rather than recognizing the plethora of different personalities and ideologies that make up our civilization, she plasters them into a black vs. white mold of absolute evil vs. absolute good, 1 vs. 0, death vs. life.  She commits reductio ad absurdum- by taking any ideology out to it's most rediculous end, including her own, you can turn it into a sham.  She insists that those who would criticize her moral opinions are morally unworthy to do so, and, in several places in the book, suggests that her opponents, whether they are labeled \\"collectivists\\", \\"mystics\\", \\"thugs\\", or \\"relativists\\", deserve to die. <br />In my mind, I continually compared Atlas Shrugged to a much better novel in a similiar vein- Orwell's \\"1984\\".  However, Orwell's work was much more realistic, and Orwell understood that any ideology, taken to an extreme, is dangerous and absurd, be it capitalism or communism.  None of his political understanding is seen in Rand's sophmoric philosophy, which sees the vast majority of humans as nothing more than sheep- similiar to the totalitarian ideologies that she despises.<br />Atlas Shrugged, while an enjoyable read, leaves quite a bit to be desired- which probably explains why most modern libertarians have left Rand behind.  Her tradition is not that of the founding fathers, nor is it that of the people of the future.	2003-08-09

In The Quest for the Quantum Computer, Julian Brown takes a look at the emerging field of Quantum Computing, a field that could potentially revolutionize many fields of computing and far-edge technology, such as cryptography, information theory, higher mathematics, and nanotechnology.<br />So what is a Quantum Computer, anyway?<br />A Quantum computer, in Brown's term (derived from the work of David Deutsch and Richard Feynman), is a computer based on an atom-scale architecture that, rather than using standard digital logic gates, uses logic gates based on &quot;qubits&quot;, or quantum bits, that can carry a bit with a value of 1, 0, or any position that could theoretically exist in between.  Such a computer could be used to process massive matrices of information in paralell, and solve mathematical problems previously thought impossible to answer.<br />Still following?<br />If not, the book isn't for you.  It's quite dense, and filled with logical and mathematical jargon- it was clearly intended to be a &quot;popular&quot; book for a select audience- people with physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science backgrounds.  But if you're interested in &quot;the new physics&quot;, on-the-edge computing, or future technologies in general, pick this book up.	2003-07-30

I'm a big fan of fantasy, and when I saw this work of historical fiction by famous semiotician Umberto Eco sitting on the library shelf, I knew I just had to pick it up.  Three days of pure enjoyment later, I'm glad I did.<br />In Baudolino, Umberto Eco takes the reader on a most picaresque journey through late 12th century Europe and the Near East, exploring Italy, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantium, Palestine, and mythical lands of the East from one of the strangest perspectives of all- that of a complete liar, Baudolino of Alessandria, a man who made a career of self-inflation and half-truths.  Yet you can't help but love the earnestness of this lifelong liar at the end of his road, and believe his story- a work of fiction wrapped in a work of fiction!  <br />Eco writes with style and depth, as well as a dry, bawdy wit.  The historical figures parade through the story in a method that suggests a satirical self-parody, while the fictional characters seem more real than the non-fictional.  But more than just a good tale, Eco's book is a postmodern novel, in that it explores the notions of truth and meaning themselves from a contradictory perspective- one that is completely false.  The book, at it's end, leaves one with a profound meditation on the nature of truth worthy of Nietzsche.<br />Crack open the book, pour yourself a nice glass of red wine, and put some Verdi on the CD player- and prepare to enjoy one of the finest novels of the decade.	2003-07-29

Books	4	25	26	N	N	A thought provoking and sometimes scary look at privacy...	Anyone who follows digerati publications such as Wired magazine and reads novels by Neal Stephenson already knows all about cryptography- that protective suit of armor that is supposed to keep all our private data safe from the thugs that would exploit it, whether they be the government, the megacorps, or the mob.  In a future of ultra-surveillance, heavy crypto is the only way to hide.<br />David Brin throws this notion in the trash.<br />In \\"The Transparent Society\\", David Brin suggests that to embrace heavy crypto is to embark in an \\"arms race\\" of secrecy that lowly private citizens can't possibly win.  The age of ultra-surveillance, universal wiretapping, and data regulation is upon us, and there's only one true way to avoid a scenario that seems straight out of Orwell- universal transparency and accountability.  In Brin's view, the technologies of data retrieval and surveillance should be made available to anyone who would make use of them- neighborhood watches could monitor their streets, parents could keep track of their children, and, while governments and agencies would have the ability to spy upon citizens, citizens and watchdog groups would have the power to spy back- and thus hold the powers that be accountable.  While we'd lose the anonymity provided by modern society, we would gain safety, not only from crime, but from abuse of authority.  We'd be able to form new community bonds that utilize distributed computing to keep tabs on each other.  And, most importantly, we'd gain peace of mind.<br />In theory, anyway.<br />While Brin's thesis is unique, formidable and provacative, it does seem to fall short in places.  For instance, there would still be a huge division between technological haves and have-nots- between the people who know how to utilize this technology and those who lack the skill, the patience, the time, the resources, or the simple will to use it.  Brin is more than a bit of a technophile (not insulting technophiles, I'm one too), and seems to assume that everyone in the neo-West is on the same page as him.  Also, despite his numerous appeals to pragmatism, the book is extremely idealistic, and runs counter to the trends we're seeing today, in both the increased scope of government surveillance powers, the increased intrusion of companies into our lives, and the ever-escalating privacy arms race being fought on the internet and in the courts.  The world is going the way of Orwell, and not the way of Brin. <br />Yet, in the end, would there be any difference?  In addition to public apathy, the sheer amount of data created by a surveillance infrastructure would be daunting to an individual attempting to make use of it.  We're already facing a massive \\"information glut\\" today, both in terms of the internet, and in terms of government agencies who, despite their increased powers in the wake of 9-11, lack the ability to sort through all the data they're recieving.  Between these problems and the haves-have nots gap, Brin's vision seems to fall short.<br />Also annoying was Brin's obsession with Plato-bashing, which seems to be a popular hobby among political philosophers ever since Karl Popper tackled \\"The Republic\\" in his book \\"The Open Society and It's Enemies\\".  Last year, however, my government advisor gave me a different view of the Republic- that the book is actually a satire, meant to show how and why totalitarianism never could work.  This flies in the face of these Popperians, who seem caught up in the idea that Plato was a proto-Nazi.<br />However, weaknesses aside, The Transparent Society is an excellent read.  I'd suggest that, for an alternative (fictional) view, anyone with an interest in this title also pick up a copy of Neal Stephenson's \\"Cryptonomicon\\".	2003-07-22

Authors seldom maintain the same quality of writing throughout their entire career.  They either splash onto the scene with an outstanding work that proves to be their best, or they creep out, honing their skill as time goes on.<br />Salvatore isn't a literary genius, but the more he writes, the better he gets.  Unlike Robert Jordan, who can't seem to sustain the energy or interest level in his plodding, soap-opera like epics, Salvatore keeps things simple, fast, and enjoyable.  Yet, at the same time, his flagship character, Drizzt Do'Urden, only seems to become deeper and more interesting as he matures.<br />In &quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot;, Salvatore takes the characters and plot threads introduced in &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; and the &quot;Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; and runs them through a thousand-page wringer.  Starting with &quot;The Legacy&quot;, we are re-introduced to Drizzt's sinister family.  In the books that follow, Salvatore seemingly puts the characters through every close call and near defeat he can, finally wrapping up the books in a touching rescue/showdown where Drizzt is forced to face defeat, only to see victory ripped from it's jaws at the last moment.  The author pulls off the necessary dramatic tension and pacing to keep the reader hanging on his every word and glued to the book through the whole wild ride.  &quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot; is far darker than the merry romp of &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, and the reintroduction of the Drow was every bit as scary as the foreshadowing in &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; promised.<br />Of course, the books have some weaknesses.  Drizzt's family members are under-used and quickly disposed of, much like the villains in Salvatore's plodding, overly-derivative &quot;Cleric Quintet&quot;.  Characters from the Quintet were introduced to the series in a relatively heavy-handed fashion, and some characters felt under-utilized (Gromph Baenre, Gandalug Battlehammer, and Berkthgar the Bold, especially).  Salvatore's writing, while better than his previous works, still lacks the detail that characterizes the works of the best fantasy authors.<br />All in all, however, if you liked the first six books in Drizzt's saga, you'll love these four.  Throw on a nice dark soundtrack, grab a drink, and enjoy the ride.	2003-07-21

Salvatore is not a writer of great literature.  He's a competent writer, but neither terribly original or talented. <br />But when an author writes a book that's this much fun, what does it matter?<br />The Icewind Dale trilogy is the literary equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie- it won't provoke your mind, but it will put you on the edge of your seat.  Salvatore spins a tale of heroic fantasy, bloody, frequent, and very detailed combat, cackling wizards, thuggish thieves, bumbling hobbi-err-halflings, mighty barbarians, dwarven halls fallen to shadow, and every other Tolkienesque fantasy cliche to ever hit paper.  But for whatever Salvatore may lack in creativity, he makes up for with pacing and a passion for storytelling that any reader looking for an enjoyable fantasy trip will fall in love with.<br />However, Salvatore does bring an interesting addition to the pot- he introduces the character of the &quot;dark elf&quot; Drizz't Do'Urden.  Whereas Tolkien's elves were light given form, the Drow of the Forgotten Realms are darkness personified- a race that knows not of love, friendship, passion, or creation- only of hatred, betrayal, lust, and destruction.  Drizz't, an outcast from his race, is the tormented, heroic soul at the center of the book- a man torn between a society that he rejected and a society that rejects him.  Whereas some critics have tried to draw (superficial) comparisons between Drizzt and Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone, there are few similarities- Moorcock's Elric is a decadent in a decadent society, whereas Drizzt rejects his decadent society for a life of rugged individualism.<br />The bottom line: Salvatore concocts a blend of action-movie heroics and fantasy cliches with a unique (and now beloved) hero.  While the story is neither challenging nor suprising (at least to veteran fans of the fantasy genre), it has the enjoyable flare of a good &quot;popcorn&quot; movie.  Salvatore truly delivers the goods, even if you've already seenthem before.	2003-07-14

People have been writing manuals for transformation for millenia.  One only needs to pick up a copy of the Dhammapada or the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali to find instructions for self-transformation that go back as far as civilized man.  A trip to the bookstore can show you that this certainly hasn't changed- self-help books on the shelves today range from the practical (\\"Achieve Optimal Health in Eight Weeks!\\") to the unlikely (\\"Pick Winning Lotto Numbers Every Time!\\") to the downright wacky (\\"Awaken your Gerbil's Psychic Powers!\\").  Many of these books promise change and transformation in a short period of time... a few days or weeks.  Instant enlightenment.<br />Michael Murphy and George Leonard have been watching and inspiring the human potential movement (the fountainhead for the \\"instant enlightenment\\" approach) for decades- in fact, they gave the movement it's name.  And, in the four decades that have passed since Murphy founded his world-famous Esalen Institute, they've learned an important lesson: there is no quick fix.  No instant moksha, no express nirvana, no overnight transformation.  Real change takes years or decades of intensive work.  To this end, they have founded a new kind of practice for a real new age: Integral Transformational Practice, or ITP- which is introduced in \\"The Life We Are Given\\".<br />ITP is not a seminar, it's not a weekend retreat.  You have to be willing to give up, evolve, and let the chips fall where they may.  Moreover, you have to be willing to engage in intensive practice over long periods of time- years, at least.  Combining a set of physical exercises based upon akaido, tai chi, and yoga, an aerobic and weightlifting regimen, a simple vegetarian diet, meditation, affirmations, visualization, philosophical and spiritual study, and community work, ITP practitioners can make changes in their lives that they never thought possible.  Physical changes, improvements in health and fitness, reversing diseases and age-related ailments,improving emotional health and learning ability, and attaining spiritual states of mind are all possible for a practitioner who is willing to work dilligently and intelligently at the practice.  Whole new worlds of opportunity are availiable by living the balanced yet aggressively evolutionary lifestyle proposed in \\"The Life We Are Given\\".<br />Recommended as companion volumes to tLwaG are Ken Wilber's \\"Sex, Ecology, Spirituality\\" (an important text on evolutionary psychology and philosophy with a focus on transformation), George Leonard's \\"Mastery\\", and Michael Murphy's \\"The Future of the Body\\".  They are all excellent guides to the integral paradigm.<br />Good luck, and good journeys!	2002-08-09

With people turning away from the churches they were raised in and world-weary atheists searching for spirituality, the spiritual marketplace is going through a boom period with no end in sight.  But in the midst of such selection, how can one tell who's faking it, and who's the real deal?  Is the teacher or author a committed seeker or a devious charlatan?  Modern, sceptical Americans often avoid spirituality all together due to horror stories of silly cults and gurus perpetrating spiritual scams on the unsuspecting public.  Who can we trust?<br />How about an Australian philosopher-psychiatrist with years of experience dealing with spirituality, transpersonal psychology, and mental illness?  Roger Walsh makes no claims to have attained a spurious level of \\"enlightenment\\" beyond a measure of basic sanity in this world gone slightly mad.  In \\"Essential Spirituality\\", Walsh provides the perfect companion to Huxley's classic \\"The Perennial Philosophy\\"- a book of practical spiritual exercises, advice, and wisdom from sages the world over.  Divided into seven sections on what Walsh believes to be the seven essential practices of the world's \\"Wisdom Traditions\\", Walsh provides advice on reducing craving, cultivating emotional wisdom, living ethically, meditating, awakening the senses, growing intuition, and pursuing spiritual action.  This isn't New Age mysticism- \\"Essential Spirituality\\" is grounded in the teachings of saints throughout the world and history, extensively documented by Dr. Walsh.  Even the most sceptical mind can see the gentle wisdom in his approach to spirituality.<br />I give this book my highest recommendation to seekers of all faiths and none- may it help you on your way.	2002-08-05

I was fascinated by the account of the various masters, lineages, stories and practices of the Tibetan Buddhist religion, and was left wanting more.<br />With \\"Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet\\", I got what I wanted.<br />Here Ray has delivered exactly what someone who holds the title \\"senior teacher\\" (Acharya) should- he shows the reader the history and philosophy of the Tantric path in as much detail as a single book can allow.  He discusses the Vajrayana lineages of Tibet, with special emphasis on the Nyingma and Kagyu.  He tells us tales of the Mahasiddhas- individuals like Padmasambhava, Tilopa, Marpa, and (my favorite), Milarepa.  He discusses the institutionalization of the Tantra as the Vajrayana, the \\"third yana\\" of Buddhism (along with the Hinayana and Mahayana).<br />Ray then goes on to discuss the philosophy behind the Vajrayana and how it developed out of Nagarjuna's Madhyamika philosophy and the work of \\"forest adepts\\" (siddhas) in Northern India in the 7th-8th centuries.  He discusses the sadhanas that make up the basis of Tantric practices, as well as the six internal yogas of Naropa, the Mahamudra, and the Dzokchen teachings.  He then concludes the book with a discussion of the Tulku tradition, death practices, reincarnation, and the peculiar events surrounding the death of the Karmapa in 1981, as well as the peculiar events surrounding the birth of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche (I was also happy to hear that a new Trungpa Tulku has been discovered and is in training).  Ray doesn't even shy away from discussing the Dzokchen \\"Rainbow Body\\" and the passing of realized masters into the samboghakaya, no matter how much this seems to conflict with modern materialist beliefs.  <br />The Siddhas weren't just mythical adepts who lived many centuries ago- it's just as possible to become one today.  In a world sorely in need of transcendental aspirations beyond insipid materialism and potential-denying Christianity, Tibetan Buddhism, mysteriously enough, provides a vision that takes us beyond the modern, postmodern, and premodern world- and into a world of unlimited spiritual possibilities.  Read Ray's \\"World of Tibetan Buddhism\\" series, and you'll understand why.	2002-08-03

Being that this is seldom the case today, the modern student of Qabalah needs a guide tailored to their level of understanding.<br />&quot;Paths of Wisdom&quot; provides such a guide.  Presenting the reader with a step by step guide to the philosophy, metaphysics, and psychology of the Qabalah, the author (John Michael Greer) guides you through a tour of the tree of life, from bottom to top, all within a single book.  With considerable erudition as well as an easy reading style, the book succeeds at presenting Qabalistic wisdom to a modern audience.<br />Unfortunately, the book's strengths end there.  There is a brief introduction and overview of the actual practice of Qabalistic mysticism, but Greer does not go into considerable depth in presenting the practice.  He does, however, present enough material to get the beginner started in Qabalistic practice.  I'd recommend D.M. Kraig's &quot;Modern Magick&quot; and Israel Regardie's &quot;The Golden Dawn&quot; to anyone looking for a book of practical work to go with the theory so clearly deliniated here.	2002-08-03

After the success of his initial works (The Spectrum of Consciousness and No Boundary), Ken Wilber gave his \\"spectrum\\" model a serious reappraisal and found it woefully lacking.  It seemed that he had made a mistake that he goes on to chide others for in his later books- he confused prerational myths with transcendental truths, and confused the spiritual fall with the scientific fall.  He makes up for his previous errors with \\"Up From Eden: A Transpersonal View of Human Evolution\\".<br />In UFE, Wilber covers the historical development of consciousness, from the animalistic/uroboric level to the typhonic, and then to the development of the Solar ego, the disassociation of the mind from the body, and the development of the rational mind.  But he takes it a step further as well, discussing the development of transrational consciousness throughout history, and discussing the differences between magical fetishism and psychic Nirmanakaya and between mythic religion and subtle archetype.  Drawing upon Freud, Jung, Campbell, and a ream of Anthropoligical and Archaeological data, Wilber paints us a fascinating picture of society, it's history, and it's discontents.  Lastly, he finishes the book by discussing his ideas for a politics of the transrational, in a fascinating chapter titled \\"Republicans, Democrats, and Mystics\\".<br />As far as Wilber's older books go, this is one not to be missed.  Although some concepts are better elucidated in Wilber's later \\"Sex, Ecology, Spirituality\\", nowhere does he draw on more anthropological support for his theories than in \\"Up From Eden\\".	2002-07-12

I read plenty of other Science Fiction and Fantasy, from Neil Stephenson to Robert Jordan, but never got around to reading this giant of the genres.  I'm glad I finally did.<br />&quot;The Dancers At the End of Time&quot; is quite possibly the wittiest and most amusing time travel scenario I have ever encountered.  Moorcock wrote this exciting little trilogy (originally published as several smaller hardcover volumes) with a wit rarely encountered in the often overly-serious sci-fa genres.  His satire drips with the delightful flavor of the turn of the century fin-de-siecle, delightful parodies of H.G. Wells, and a delicate, romantic heart that matches the author's humor.  I laughed at Jerekh's bumbling attempts at romance.  I cried at the almost tragic occurences near the end of the novel, and I cheered at the resolution.  Having just finished reading Mary Doria Russell's depressing &quot;The Sparrow&quot; (although also an excellent book), I needed something a bit more uplifting.  This did the trick.<br />If you're looking for a good intelligent satire, you can do no wrong by taking a look at this classic Moorcock masterpiece.	2002-07-02

Bodhisattva's Brave New World	What will realize god-consciousness first- Carbon or Silicon?<br />In Boomeritis, Ken Wilber's first novel, and probably his most avant-garde project yet (which is saying quite a bit), the philosopher-sage from Colorado jumps into the pop spirituality marketplace with a book that pokes fun at the New Age movement, takes a flamethrower to the sacred cows of what Spiral Dynamics refers to as the \\"mean green meme\\", and has enough raunchy sex fantasies to make Robert Anton Wilson blush.  This ain't James Redfield or Deepak Chopra, not by a long shot.<br />\\"Boomeritis\\" is the \\"Great Postmodern Novel\\".  It's about nothing but theory, filled with two-dimensional characters and silly, cruel dialogue, constantly self-references, interrupts all meaningful thoughts with lewdness, reduces all meaning to surface features and irony- and this is precisely what makes this novel so brilliant.  In writing such a novel, Wilber shows his reader precisely what is wrong with \\"flatland\\" by subtly [pulling] the reader into his worldview, and then bludgeoning the reader with the realization that he's been had- that the shallowness of the novel and the endless gags are nothing but a ploy and a put on by a literary zen master in an attempt to beat the reader into awakening.  It's a turnabout that will catch the reader unprepared, even if he thinks he's prepared for it.  Wilber's deviousness and tongue-in-cheek humor, though evident in his scholarly works as well, are out in full force here.<br />But \\"Boomeritis\\" is more than just an extremely long koan.  It's a musing on consiciousness, artificial intelligence, and meaning.  It has a wonderful segment in which Wilber relates true stories from his friend, the musician Stuart Davis, who is featured as a prominent character in the story.  Best of all, the ending is an absolute blast.<br />Pick up Boomeritis, for Wilber tells the truth, if in a somewhat roundabout way- this novel will set you free.	2002-06-19

I love authors like Gibson, Stevenson, and Varley- science fiction novelists who hit you with material that combines great writing with action and characters who seem like they popped out of the latest hollywood action thriller.  Sci-fi filled with weird devices, cool dialogue, and strange venues.  The Sci-fi that computer geeks and teenage punks can't get enough of.<br />\\"The Sparrow\\" is not Sci-fi.<br />Russell is a writer of mature, philosophical science fiction in the grand tradition of authors such as Asimov, Clarke, and Huxley.  Science fiction that truly makes you wonder about not only the physical (science), but the metaphysical as well.  Questions of morality, spirituality, meaning, and destiny are all actively pursued by such authors- not as afterthoughts or decoration, but as the centerpiece of the fiction.  Such works create a vital mythology for the postmodern and impending transhuman eras- they weave truths into their tales.<br />\\"The Sparrow\\" charts the journey of Emilio Sandoz, a Jesuit Priest and linguist, from the slums of San Juan to the planet of Rakhat, 4.3 Light Years from Earth, orbiting the star Alpha Centauri A.  Along with an intriguing little group of well-meaning Jesuits, scientists, and engineers, this modern-day Cortez sets off to a new world in search, not of gold, but of spiritual treasure.  Instead, he encounters disease, hardships, and two strange alien races barred from truly understanding humans by millions of years of evolutionary history.  Ultimately, his search for god, about to finally be realized, is transformed into a carnal nightmare which destroys his illusions of divinity and nearly leaves him for dead.  From this, Sandoz must retell his tale before a council of fellow priests, and face his own existential anguish over having his dreams of grace crushed by the nightmare of an uncaring universe.<br />Overall, I would say that the Sparrow is one of the most captivating and engaging novelsI've ever had the fortune of reading.  I highly recommend this book not only to lovers of the philosophical tradition of Science Fiction, but to \\"Sci-Fi\\" fans as well- perhaps it will kick start their own spiritual journey- one that, with any luck, will be as profound and meaningful as Sandoz's odyssey.	2002-06-16

Modern translators and teachers, such as Lama Surya Das and Robert A.F. Thurman, have attempted to portray Buddhism in a modernistic light, as a progressive route of compassion and evolution.  However, according to Evola, both interpretations are incorrect.<br />Evola digs through the earliest texts of the Pali Canon to expose a tradition of &quot;ascesis&quot;- not life-denying, repressive asceticism as we know in the west, but a tradition of detachment and training towards enlightenment through proper thought, reflection, and action.  He puts Buddhism in historical perspective, showing it as a movement that started with the intention of renewing the Brahmanical tradition, one based not on modern equality and humanitarianism but on spiritual elitism and the favoring of a spiritual elect known as the Ariya.  Lastly, he tries to show how those of us living in the modern world can attempt to follow the tradition of liberation.<br />Although I don't accept some of Evola's interpretations or conclusions, he brings up many valid points and exposes a spiritual tradition that still holds validity today- and will perhaps for the rest of the age as well.	2002-06-12

Aleister Crowley was clearly one of the latter.  He indulged in sex and spirituality with the gusto of the greatest tantric, wrote with a passion and a flair for the english language matched by few, and has captured the imagination of numerous rebels from mainstream society.  And nowhere- NOWHERE- is Crowley's story told better than in his own confessions, the tale of the poet, the mystic, the saint that had the audacity to claim the title of the Beast whose number is 666, the Lion of Light.<br />However, I will clarify my statement- although his autobiography is fascinating and rewarding, it's not something that you can finish in one or two sittings.  It's the sort of book that you'll keep next to your bed for months with finishing, yet will felt driven to read on in Crowley's odyssey.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in modern Western spirituality, the world of Imperial Britain and it's quirkier characters, or Crowley and his religion, Thelema.	2002-06-07

Inayat Khan's essays show an Islam that embraces both it's Judeochristian roots and contributions from other religions (such as Hinduism and Buddhism), and a breath of fresh, progressive air in a world where stagnant religion can lead to terrible tragedies.  However, while \\"Sufism\\" is long on theory and metaphysics, there is little information on real practice- those looking for a guide to Sufi spiritual practice must look elsewhere.	2002-06-05

While glancing through the Eastern Religion section of a local bookstore, I stumbled upon this fine little volume.<br />Wangyal Rinpoche delivers more than a guide to the practice of Dream Yoga- he delivers a guide to a complete nondual practice.  The book includes meditation instructions, Guru Yoga and Dakini practices, breathing instructions, a guide to basic Tibetan bioenergetics, a little history of the Bon tradition, a brief introduction to Tantra and Dzogchen, and even a glossary filled with Tibetan and Sanskrit terms used throughout the book.  There is enough here to begin a spiritual practice beyond dream yoga.<br />To the seeker looking for a guide to Tibetan mysticism, look no further- \\"The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep\\" is the perfect introduction.	2002-05-29

She combines transpersonal insight with prerational garbage.  She spouts about her revolutionary new political program, but says little of substance.  In one breath, she supports genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and space colonization- and in another she damns the infrastructure necessary to make these advancements possible.<br />Conscious Evolution is, to be completely honest, a substanceless mess.  Hubbard can't seem to get across any semblence of a message without resorting to quoting another book- typically with quotes that are of a declaratory rather than factual nature.  The writing is poor and lacks depth.  Although there are good ideas within (the \\"Peace Room\\", SYNCON, etc.) one must read through pages of fluff in order to get there.<br />Rather than waste your time with this book, take a look at some of Hubbard's sources, such as K. Eric Drexler or Ken Wilber.  Your time and money will be much better spent.	2002-05-10

The Spectrum of Consciousness was Wilber's first attempt at outlining an integral model of the human psychological experience, combining Freudian ego-psychology, existentialism, and spiritual transcendence in one neat, elegant package.  Although the original conception shown here has not survived the test of time (or Wilber's ever critical mind), it still stands as a masterful beginning to a corpus of work that will make Wilber as famous and influential as Nietzsche and Freud a century from now.  For an intellectual treat, read this book in conjunction with Wilber's \\"No Boundary\\", and then compare with \\"Sex, Ecology, Spirituality\\" and \\"Integral Psychology\\" for a fascinating look at the continuing evolution of integral thought.

I'll give Friedman's book this much- it's a worthy and interesting read.  Unfortunately, it suffers from many of the same problems that all other technolibertarian manifestos suffer from.<br />Friedman still can't solve the dilemma of how to make the transition from a welfare state based on Keynesian economics to a technolibertarian commons.  He throws out the revolution rhetoric, but has no solution to replace it with- after all, who thinks that career politicians are going to give up their jobs so easily?  Only electing libertarians to office could accomplish this task- and with the libertarian party continuing to flounder in unworkable political dogma and no real social support, such an occurance is unlikely.  Friedman tries to solve the problems of national defense- and yet again fails.  All that he can offer us is dodgy answers and semantic goo.<br />However, I give the book four stars for several inspired ideas and chapters, and I recommend this book as a good introduction to the anarchist right for college Poli Sci students (like myself) and disaffected young liberals trying to escape the dogma of their leftist upbringing (also like myself).	2002-05-06

I wilfully overlooked James Redfield's name, however. (Purveyor of new-age Schlock)<br />The book was a waste of money.  All that the authors manage to do is give a brief survey of the perennial philosophy (done far more masterfully in Aldous Huxley's famous anthology), talk about exceptional capabilities manifesting in human beings (accomplished with far more documentation and flair in Murphy's own \\"Future of the Body\\"), and tie it together with evolutionary rhetoric pulled straight out of Ken Wilber's \\"Sex, Ecology, Spirituality: The Spirit of Evolution\\" (one of the best books I have ever read).

Dr. Larry Dossey delivers far less than he promises in &quot;Space, Time, and Medicine&quot;.  Instead of a revolutionary &quot;new paradigm&quot;, he presents us with many ideas that seem to have little to do with curing illness, and far more to do with Dr. Dossey's spiritual views.  I seriously doubt that an individual suffering from heart disease or terminally ill with cancer would be comforted by being told that they are misperceiving time!  Although the idea that modifications in consciousness can change the outcome of an illness does have scientific evidence backing it (as well as plenty of anecdotal evidence, and, in my case, second-hand experience), the book fails to cover how meditation and consciousness-altering practices can be effectively applied against disease- and, in the twenty years since this book was written, little progress has been made (other than a general acceptance of yoga and meditation as a supplement to orthodox treatments).<br />Despite this critique, however, Dossey does present several interesting arguments in favor of his approach, and some fascinating case studies, including one involving a psychic police officer suffering from stress-related illness, and some interesting observations involving the health of people with &quot;type A&quot; personalities and worldviews.  Dossey demonstrates a mastery of physics uncommon among individuals outside the field, and does an excellent job of explaning the physical thought of Prigogine, Bohm, Heisenberg, Einstein, and Bohr, as well as the mathematical proofs of Kurt Godel.<br />&quot;Space, Time, and Medicine&quot; isn't beach reading, doesn't present any revolutionary new data, and won't shake the ground beneath your feet.  But if you're a physician interested in following up on potentially effective &quot;alternative&quot; approaches, or a layman with an interest in how the &quot;new physics&quot; relate to your state of being- you can do far worse than read this book.	2001-07-16
