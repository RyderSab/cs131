The Black Jewels trilogy was way down on the bottom of the pile, but I figured I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Lightning strikes again!  The Black Jewels trilogy was one of those series that one doesn't want to end and makes a reader pester the author for more.<br /><br />Having grown up in a fairly religious household, the character names and where much of the action took place really played with my head--and that's a good thing.  This series forced me out of my comfort zone and to rethink my preconceived ideas about good and evil, masculine and feminine, especially when it comes to fantasy, where sometimes the whole good/evil dichomtomy becomes stale.  It is NOT for everyone.  The Black Jewels trilogy is DARK.  It is violent, it is bloody and what befalls some of the characters is downright horrific.  However, it is also hopeful and in some instances quite lighthearted.<br /><br />Because of her skilled characterizations and the gripping (sometimes painful) narrative, the SaDiablo men--Saetan, Daemon and Lucivar--are not merely amazing, but even downright sexy.  They are a different and refreshing take on the \\"alpha male\\".  Yes, they are dominant and capable of great violence and greater passions, but they serve Queens with a deep code of honor that is constantly tested.  They accept the powerful women in their lives as equals.  What Daemon does in the final novel 'Queen of the Darkness' in order to buy time for Witch had me up several nights re-reading that part.<br /><br />Ms. Bishop also skewers the notion of the peaceful matriarchal society by creating some of the cruelest female Witches ever written--Heketah and Dorothea SaDiablo.  However, these women aren't just evil for the sake of being that way, it's how they amass such power over everyone that makes them so compelling and fiendishly nasty.  You just know that they and those whom they've corrupted are eventually going to get theirs, but it's one hell of an emotional rollercoaster.<br /><br />Men in this world live to serve as long as those whom they serve are worthy and treat them with respect.  The idea of the jewels as conduits of powers was one that in the hands of a less skillful writer would have easily become just another trite plot device.<br /><br />Jaenelle was a reminder as to what the power of Witch--the dream made flesh--should have been, rather than what it had become.  She grows from her tragic childhood into a young woman with far more power than anyone had forseen, and the knowledge of what such power entails.  Jaenelle's not Wonder Woman, and she makes mistakes along the path to her destiny.  She's not perfect, and in spite of being so powerful finds that simple Craft tasks are beyond her.  Jaenelle can do very bad things to those who get on her bad side, but she cannot cook.<br /><br />Other characters are just as vivid--one of my favorites being Surreal, the Dea al Mon ex-courtesan/assassin with her own pain to bear and vengeance to take; and Karla, the young Queen of Glacia who isn't fazed by the SaDiablo males and who enjoys yanking their chains every once in a while.  The non-human Kindred are just as fully fleshed out, especially the adorable and highly protective Ladvarian, as any of the human characters.  Ms. Bishop doesn't scrimp and she makes it more than clear that an 800 pound Arcerian cat named Kaelas isn't just cute window dressing, but capable of inflicting some serious damage.<br /><br />Here's the deal and another HUGE reason why the Black Jewels trilogy stands out--yes the heroes/heroines are powerful and yes they have the ability to wipe the floor (or in this case cleanse the realm) of all evil.  But as it's said with great power comes great responsibility, and in this case even great sacrifice.  Overall, the Black Jewels trilogy is about families--the ones we're born with and the ones we create.  It's about love, loyalty, cruelty andrevenge.<br /><br />This series has done what I thought had almost become impossible--breathed new life into a genre that I enjoy, but also realize has become quite stale.  This world was as intense, as bloody and as intriguing as any I've read thus far and I can only hope Ms. Bishop will return to it soon.ecome impossible--breathed new life into a genre that I enjoy, but also realize has become quite stale.

Tortured doesn't even begin to define this Dark Hunter, but in Ms. Kenyon's skillful hands, he's no angst-ridden weenie.  Zarek is sexy, has mondo attitude and takes orders from no one, including Ash, who has his own reasons for trying to save him.  Even his fellow Dark Hunters would rather kill him than look at him.<br /><br />I had completely forgotten one of my favourite classic rock songs by Nazareth until Zarek reminded me - Hair of the Dog fits him to the letter.<br /><br />With such an overwhelming protagonist, it would seem that Astrid, sent to find some reedeeming quality in him, would just be window dressing, but she stands up to him toe to toe, never letting Zarek get away with being his typically onerery self.<br /><br />Zarek's history was painful to read, and I definitely shed a tear or two as it was slowly revealed.  The idea of someone surviving that kind of emotional and physical torture only made me cheer for Zarek even more.<br /><br />So far, this is the BEST of the Dark Hunter books and Ms. Kenyon has no other way to go but up.	2005-07-30

Both Alexion and Dangereuse seemed at first glance, like the type of characters guaranteed to spark fireworks.<br /><br />I was totally disappointed.<br /><br />Firstly, the dark-huntress in question.  Not only was she less powerful than her dark-hunter male brethren, but she was too typical as a female character.  I mean the double-standard was horribly glaring - the other male dark-hunters/were-hunters had healthy (if often lonely) sex lives, but that didn't seem to bother them much.  Dangereuse St. Richard didn't fit that mold - for her sex had to be emotionally linked (I really thought in a dark-hunter universe the women would have as big a libido as do the males, since they don't have to worry about getting pregnant or deal with other issues).  Sure she had a few kick-butt moments, but she could have taken some serious lessons in kicking-butt from Xena (or even Wonder Woman).<br /><br />Alexion started off as with a bang - here to kick take names and then kick-butt, but soon turned into this angst-ridden tragic figure that I wasn't certain I wanted to feel sorry for.  I guess after Zarek and Vane, I had really high expectations.<br /><br />The only saving graces of this book are Simi (her infatuation for Travis Fimmel is just hysterical) and Ash - and I can't wait to read his story.<br /><br />To be honest, the best females for dark-huntress status are Tabitha Devereaux, Sunshine Ravenwolf and Bride McTierney - and these ladies started off as humans.<br /><br />I'm hoping Wren's story will be the redeeming tale.	2005-07-30

Obviously their self-hatred extends to the romance genre as well.<br /><br />Well, as a healthy and happy size 14 to 16 amazonian queen, I don't have such problems and I loved Bride McTierney as much as I loved Sunshine Ravenwolf - yet another full figured female in the Dark-Hunter universe.  There were times I wanted to hit her for not having a little more faith in herself, but could understand her reluctance to get emotionally attached as well as her self-esteem issues considering her jerk-off ex-boyfriend dumped her for something that looked like a bone, but when it came down to defending her man, Bride was all business.<br /><br />Was it improbable for Vane Kattalakis, this drop-dead gorgeous stud of a man/wolf to find his mate in a size 18, red-haired venus of willendorf of a woman?  No it wasn't, because Vane saw the beauty inside as well as savored the lush curves on the outside.  Their lovemaking scenes were actually rather celebratory of the full-figured woman and made me cheer as well as get aroused.<br /><br />And what was there not to like about Vane?  Tall, dark, furry, fiercely loyal to those he loves and...loaded.<br /><br />I may get flamed for this, but the Were-Hunters are just a bit more fascinating to me as a reader than the Dark-Hunters, save for Zarek (my psychotic baby).  Just the world Vane and his brother Fang (gotta love those names) inhabit is both beautiful and harsh, full of magic and danger.  Parts of Vane's story made me cringe - Kenyon definitely knows how to put the 'fun' in dysfunctional considering that both Vane's parents want to kill him for different reasons. I also loved Vane's other brother, the omega wolf Fury, and I can't wait to read something about him.<br /><br />What else did I love - Sanctuary the Bar (I have got to get down to New Orleans and find this place!) Mama Bear Peltier is like this den mother to all these different types of fantastic beings, and reading about her trouble-prone quintuplets (check out the Dark-Hunter website for pictures - they're all delicious!)brought a huge chuckle.  Fury being introduced to mashed potatoes for the first time is side-splitting comedy, and when all three brothers discover what Bride's dad does for a living, I had to stick my hand in my mouth to keep from laughing out loud on the bus.  Nick Gautier trying to give Vane lessons on dating (bad idea).  Simi the demon deserves her own story some day - maybe she'll get Travis Fimmel, and not eat him.

Skip the rest of the stories unless trite plots and really scary prose are your cup of tea.  I'm sorry, but it's hard to get turned-on when the word 'throbbing love lance' keeps getting tossed about.<br /><br />The other stories were pretty forgettable too.<br /><br />I find it rather disturbing that some reviewers don't seem to be emotionally mature enough to understand that sex, no matter what age, is still a healthy and normal human function.  Frankly, I've always liked when a writer isn't afraid to take a risk by creating characters that aren't the standard romance trope. I don't know about most romance readers, but I've a rather sophisticated palate and can handle characters and situations that haven't been done before.  That's always been the big problem with romance - the unwillingness to take risks.  Thankfully we have Ms. Schone who obviously isn't.<br /><br />I loved Megan and Connor (known as Mohmmed)- they were so beautiful and you felt their need for this basic human connection.  Your heart just goes out for Megan, who has spent most of her life in a marriage completely devoid of even an embrace, and how she craves just to be touched.<br /><br />And Connor - yes, the whole eunuch aspect isn't easy to read about, but it was a part of history and it did happen (read Anne Rice's 'Cry to Heaven' about the Italian castrati).  But just because he might have been missing a certain part, that doesn't diminish him as a man - and that's another great thing - makes the reader consider what exactly being a 'man' is.<br /><br />Ms. Schone has the ability to create rich and multifaceted characters in a short amount of space, and erotic tension that just won't let go.  She creates characters that you really love and who feel real.  The sex scenes are hot, but they're written in such a way that makes you feel as if you're there and you're experiencing the passion.  When the story ended it was like saying goodbye to old and familiar friends.  And she didn't leave the reader with the typical 'happy ending', but in your heart, you could always hope.there and you're experiencing the passion.

I had such high hopes for this book, having heard about it last year and it was eagerly anticipated.<br /><br />Honestly, I felt shortchanged - Kris and Tom (the couple shown on the cover of the book) seemed to be nothing more than window dressing.  There was no depth or breadth to their characters.  The book spent more time on the developing relationship between Jill and Scott - Kris' best friend.<br /><br />I didn't really care that the sensuality level wasn't high - because anyone who had read Ms. Rutland's books in the past know that isn't her forte.  However, there wasn't even the slightest hint of erotic tension between Kris and Tom.<br /><br />The only reason I give this book a '3' is for Harlequin finally understanding that interracial marriages are a fact of life and all women want to read a GOOD story about such love.  I also give this book a '3' because I like Eva Rutland.	2005-03-07

But Only Just	This is a quick and fun read if you're willing to allow yourself several hours of a willingness to suspend disbelief.  If you are not a fan of explicit sexual encounters set in a world where women are pleasure slaves, you might want to skip this one completely.  Some parts of The Emperess' New Clothes are worth a few chuckles here and there.<br /><br />Having said all that, my biggest problem with this book is the main characters are for the most part, cardboard cut-outs.  Romance/romantica isn't just about plot, but about characters who jump right off the page and into the reader's heart.  This didn't happen with me in this book. Zor was the overbearing and arrogant alpha male stock type that I thought romance had done away with nearly a decade ago.  Not only did his attitude drive me to distraction, it seemed that he couldn't see past his own very large member that Kyra, the woman he claimed to 'love' was actually a real-life flesh and blood human being.<br /><br />And Kyra Summers, the human woman kidnapped by Zor to be his 'Sacred Mate' was everything about a female character I have always loathed in romance.  She was far too passive for my tastes, accepting too easily her new 'status' as available lust object.  Sure, she was a little miffed about hatching children rather than carrying them for nine months, and she wasn't all that thrilled about having extremely large (...)for several weeks, but that seemed to be the extent of her 'rebellion'.<br /><br />I didn't get any sense of any true erotic tension or real emotion between Kyra and Zor, and neither did they show any growth as characters.<br /><br />The only saving grace was Geris, Kyra's best friend.  Contrary to what some reviews have said about her being a 'stereotype' (and I have to wonder if it's their own stereotyped views of black women which might cloud their judgements), her character had all the spunk and attitude that I wished Kyra had.  I can see Geris placing a few big grains of sand into the machine of Trystonni life and driving Dak crazy.  I will be reading her story next.<br /><br />The sex, at least for me as a writer and reader of erotica, was rather tame in scope.  I was hoping for hot and cutting edge, but ended up with pages and pages of vanilla couplings.  I didn't have any issue with the whole non-monogamy aspect of the book, but it seemed as if the 'rules' were slightly skewed in favour of the males.  I also found it a little interesting that Ms. Black shied away from an encounter between the Chief Priestess Ari and Kyra that didn't involve Zor.  Also, there was just NO emotional tension or bonding in the scenes.  It was like reading a manual or something.<br /><br />The world of Tryston wasn't as fleshed out as I'd hoped for such a good-sized book.  It would have been interesting to read about the evolution of Trystonni society and why women are in the positions they are.  I didn't have any issues with the whole women as sexual mates/domination angle, but it would have worked better in the hands of a more skilled writer.<br /><br />Still, Jaid Black is to be commended for being one of the pioneers of the romantica field, though personally, I think Robin Schone is still the reigning queen.ing Dak crazy.

Firstly, one of the biggest reasons I loved this book was the fact that Alison Kent wasn't afraid to tread the interracial romance waters, proving that once again, love is colourblind. I sincerely hope more Blaze authors (and romance writers in general)will finally take the hint.<br /><br />Annabel 'Poe' Lee is a career-driven woman with no time for romance, which was why the off the Richter-scale fling with Patrick Coffey served her well. Unfortunately for Patrick, Annabel has decided to call off their hot relationship.<br /><br />Patrick has other ideas.<br /><br />Having reviewed 'The Sweetest Taboo' (also by Ms. Kent), I bemoaned the fact that the female protagonist in that story (Erin Thatcher) was hard to relate to. Not so with Annabel Lee. Annabel was a woman who didn't want to lose control--she had plans, and she wanted stability, the things she simply couldn't see someone as rootless and damaged as Patrick seemed to be.<br /><br />Vin Diesel automatically came to mind as I read descriptions of Patrick, especially when he finally shaves his hair. It was also nice to see nipple piercings mentioned on his chest (oh hot). Alison Kent takes the beta male to new heights as Patrick attempts to reconcile his demons, tie up the loose ends of his past, and to keep the woman he loves.<br /><br />Not to mention the man was a culinary genius!<br /><br />The sex scenes in this book are HOTTER than Phoenix in July, but it's not just sex--there's real emotion involved, and sometimes it's an uncomfortable place for a reader to be. It's like being a voyeur in an intensely private moment with two strangers.	2004-07-29

It's like they like things wrapped up in one nice and neat package, and unfortunately for these readers, 'Gone Too Far' is not the easy beach read that many expected.  It's an emotional rollercoaster ride into the minds and hearts of two people with a lot of preconceived notions and personal baggage.<br />In many romances, the alpha male and the beta female stay in their tidy little box and never experience any emotional growth whatsoever.  That formula has long since outlived its usefulness and personally, I've way outgrown such trite plots and characterizations.  I say, challenge me and make me feel something different.<br />Thankfully, Ms. Brockmann has written a gritty and wonderfully realistic romantic-suspense novel with two of the most multi-dimensional characters ever to grace the pages of any book.<br />Sam Starett is both maddening and wonderful.  He's got a true heart of gold in his rough and tumble exterior.  Sometimes you want to kiss him and other times, you want to kick him.  And knowing a little more of his backstory (from The Defiant Hero) makes him even more sympathetic.<br />What can I say about my girl Alyssa Locke?  Ms. Brockmann wrote a character I fully identify with, being a black woman in a predominantly male field.  I totally understand how Alyssa feels--that she has to be better, smarter and tougher than the guys in order to be seen as competent.  Sam and Alyssa's sparring matches are one of the major highlights of this book.  Oh yes, they're going to get together, but it's not going to be easy--but it will be worth it.<br />Sam and Alyssa have got to be one of the best (as well as one of the sexiest)in romantic fiction.  I consider them like 'old friends' and can't wait to see if they appear in more adventures.<br />A small yet cynical part of me thinks that those who didn't like 'Gone Too Far' haven't quite left the dark ages when it comes to a book that deals honestly and refreshingly with interracial relationships.  In this day and age, we're supposed to be a lot more enlightened--and I've always believed love to be colourblind.

Come on, this woman wasn't born in the dark ages, she was supposedly educated--she'd have known that what happened to her wasn't her fault.  The idea of making her slightly virginal isn't realistic).  Thankfully, the entire book wasn't spent dwelling on the issue.  Of course, because she had married an older man, it was natural that some of her family and peers might look slightly askance at her choosing a mate in the oppsite direction.<br />Kumi Walker was the perfect beta male--a strong, positive man with his own cross to bear.  Too bad some of these category stories don't allow much in the way of deeper development, I would have liked to have seen more interaction between him and his father.  At least he was more than ready to have a serious relationship with a classy and well-educated woman, like Veronica.  I also liked the fact that he was a well-traveled young man who spoke French fluently.  A nice romantic touch.<br />What I really loved about this book (and one of the main reasons I gave it 5 stars) was in its portrayal of wealthy and educated black people who ARE NOT rappers.  Ms. Alers' gives the reader a bit of history into the lives of old black money in the South.  The family moments are wonderful as well.	2003-07-31

This first foray was more than satisfactory, the writing superb and the story was engrossing.  Even her descriptions of Sebastian's GTO were excellent, making it into an almost living entity rather than a machine.<br />The sex, while definitely off the Richter scale for Harlequin, was still pretty vanilla. I will say, there are shades of Robin Schone in Ms. Kent's emotion-filled scenes, and that's not a bad thing.  I especially liked the opening masturbatory scene with Sebastian in the shower was highly erotic and very well-written without being judgemental of his motives.<br />I throughly enjoyed Sebastian Gallo/Ryder Falco.  He was a definite paen to the handsome, brooding heroes of gothic romance novels.  The descriptions of him, his clothes, what he thought, made him very real.  As a writer, I can completely sympathize with the capriciousness of the creative process.  He is a man whom one has to earn the right to love him, since he doesn't love easily.  He wasn't quite an alpha male because he definite had his own code of honor when it came to dealing with Erin Thatcher.  I would love to read an entire book about his life, especially his time spent in behind bars.<br />I did NOT like of Erin Thatcher.  She was/is everything about a female character I simply can't stand.  Anal, insecure, a trust-fund baby with no sense of direction--was she really the kind of brazen and ballsy woman to engage in a torrid affair with her sexy neighbor?  Most of the book was spent in her feeling sorry for herself and not being able to decide whether owning an upscale bar in Houston was her life's work.  And, talk about reinforcing the notion that women cannot tell the difference between sex and love, Erin Thatcher is the poster child.<br />I give this book 4 stars because of the secondary characters: Tess and Samantha (the e-mail friends with the good advice), Cali and Will.  Their romance would also make a good book, though I was rather disappointed that Cali didn't stick to her guns at the end in terms of the screenplay project.

The fact of the matter is that while such things did indeed occur in the 12th century (and sadly continue into now), the attempt to somehow make such an act erotic stretches the bounds of imagination.  There is erotic and then there is sheer cruelty.  Rosehaven was sadly the latter.<br />I disliked Severin.  He was the alpha male taken to cartoonish extremes.  This could be excused if this were Ms. Coulter's first book, but it isn't.  Besides, I've read other historical romances set in this same time period that showed a lot more sensitivity, like 'The Lily and The Leopard' by Susan Wiggs.<br />I disliked Hastings.  She was a doormat incarnate.  Enough said.<br />The marten was a nice touch, and the only saving grace. I would have enjoyed reading about its mating expoloits rather than the dysfunctional relationship between the two humans.<br />Thankfully, Ms. Coulter redeems herself big time with her wonderfully comic 'Bride Trilogy'.	2003-07-12

Several years later, I picked it up in this new edition.  Either way, this book was totally disappointing. Apparently in the 80's the idea of the hero raping the leading lady was considered cutting edge (I didn't think so then and certainly don't think so now), because it seemed a standard trope for many authors.  And not only was the character Kate raped in brutalized in childhood, but Julien, the man who supposedly 'loves' her, thinks that her reticence in the bedroom is merely a case of nerves and sets out to forcibly change her mind.<br />Now, I realize that the characters of Kate and Julien are loosely based upon Taming of the Shrew, but where that play was strictly comedy (I don't even take the Shakespearean Katherine's end soliquy seriously--and neither does she), this Katherine is not only a royal pushover, she seems bent on forgiving everything.  And Julien, you are no Petruccio!<br />In the beginning, Kate shows a bit of gumption, and she's quite appealing, especially dressed in men's clothes and engaging in a mock duel with her brother. She speaks her mind freely and one could see why Julien would be interested in her. As the story progresses, she turns into that simpering little waif that can drive most readers to distraction.  She does, however, show a little spirit when she takes down a scandalous former love interest who was trying to get her hands upon the oh so virile Julien.<br />And Julien...Ms. Coulter has created some wonderful and warm male leads, and Julien St. Clair simply isn't one of them.  A narcissistic rake who needs to have his ears boxed in, he's a completely clueless cad who doesn't think beyond his own needs.<br />I guess the only saving grace to this entire mess of a book was that Ms. Coulter dealt with the subject of child abuse long before it was fashionable.  Kate's father was evil incarnate and it would have been nice to have him get his just deserts.<br />One last word on the rape scenes--now I happen to like erotic romance quite a lot, and I have no problem with the idea of sexual power play as long as its consensual.  What happened to Kate in this book might have worked better had it been written in that style.word on the rape scenes--now I happen to like erotic romance quite a lot, and I have no problem with the idea of sexual power play as long as its consensual.

I see him as a hulky redhead in leather and tattoos.<br />Other than that, this book only proves that Ms. Kenyon has created a world that will leave you breathless and wanting to spend a lot of time in New Orleans.  I am definitely going to find Sanctuary (if you don't know what I'm talking about, read the books).<br />I liked the character of Sunshine Runningwolf.  Like many creative people (myself included), she's got one foot here and another in her craft.  The fact that she's not a standard romance heroine (i.e. a perfect size 6 and obsessing about her weight, wanting to get married before the age of 30), is actually refreshing.  In fact, Sunshine doesn't want to get married to Talon, just wants a mutually repectful relationship with him.  I also love the fact that like many of Ms. Kenyon's female leads, they are sexually liberated women.  they have no problems oogling and lusting over a good-looking man.<br />Now, on to Talon of the Morrigantes.  This is yet another one I wouldn't kick out of my bed for eating crackers (and he does).  Just the descriptions of him dressed in his trademark leathers was enough for me to grab a fan.  I don't even mind that he keeps two crocodiles as pets and prefers living in the swamp.  The man rides a Harley, so anything can be forgiven.<br />His story, like most of th Dark-Hunters is one of vengeance and redemption, but in the hands of a skilled writer like Ms. Kenyon, doesn't turn into a hackneyed plot device.  Talon has to find his own way to freedom, and it's enough to tear my heartstrings.<br />Of course, I've fallen madly in love with the just borderline psychotic Zarek.  The exchanges between him and Nick are priceless.  Perfect choice of music for Zarek to listen to, 'Hair of the Dog' by Nazereth.  If you know the song, you'll get the joke.<br />It was nice to revisit old friends like Kyrian and Julian again. Acheron even comes off as a bit more human (the nose ring was a great touch), and I can't wait to read his story.<br />I'm doing my best not to give away anything.  If you haven't read this series, you don't know what you're missing.

In fact, having rediscovered my taste for paranormal romances, this one had a rather interesting premise.<br />If anything, the sexual scenes lacked the emotional intensity I have come to expect from someone whom my favourite writer, Robin Schone considers one of the best in the genre.  Not to mention they were rather vanilla in scope.<br />While I enjoyed Aimery Fitz Clare as a beta male hero, it seemed as if Ms. Holly was trying to make him both a beta and an alpha male.  Gillian was probably one of the most boring immortals I've ever read about.  I couldn't empathize with her.  Nim Wei would have made a better lead heroine, because there seemed to be more depth to her.<br />While I was disappointed in this book, I am looking forward to reading Ms. Holly's Victorian-themed romances.	2003-06-11

He knows the Unsidhe Court better than anyone, and is intelligent enough to know when to use his power and when to use diplomacy.  Frost is too much like the nickname bestowed upon him by Andais. Rhys still has issues with Goblins, and Galen, while cute, would be nothing more than a boy toy.<br />Not to get racial or anything, but there's something rather cutting edge about a dark-skinned fae character.  Most writers (save Emma Bull), tend to stick closely with the typical Celtic-looking faerie folk.<br />I have to admit, Merry was hard to take in the first book, especially for those of us used to the kick-butt attitude of Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake.  However, Meredith has come into her own, and she is definitely not one to be tread upon lightly, as a few of her encounters with The Queen of Air and Darkness show.<br />What I really love about this series is that the fae are NOT these cute little people who help humans in need.  In fact, these fae are rather dismissive (and in some cases hostile)to mankind.  These fae are far closer literature-wise than the Disney-fied versions that we're familiar with.  Some of their actions in the book definitely make one squirm.  Even Doyle and Frost, as close to heroes as a character can be, remind the reader in some startling ways not to use human benchmarks to judge their actions.<br />And yes, there is sex in the book--but it does not detract from the gist of the story.  After all, Merry does need to get an heir before her psychotic cousin Prince Cel does.  However, just as she does in her characterizations of the fae, Ms. Hamilton is trying to get the reader to look beyond our notions of what sex is and isn't.  She wants us to see it through the eyes of the fae, who lack all the cultural taboos that humans seem to possess.<br />I also like the subtle discussion of the attitudes of the Sidhe in regards to other faerie beings.	2003-02-11

The bad news--after reading any of Ms. Heyer's books, one becomes a true stickler for detail when it comes to other writers in this genre.<br />Like most of her novels, 'Cotillion' is a witty and elegant romp through the world of the beau monde--its foibles and its fashions.<br />Kitty Charing in her own right is as assertive as any modern heroine as she learns to navigate the convoluted social waters of London.  Unlike those around her, she sees the good in everyone, which of course lead to some comic mishaps.  Her pretend 'fiance' Freddy is wonderful as the not-quite-as-brain-dead-as-everyone-thinks-him man about town.<br />Like all of Ms. Heyer's novels, it does help to be rather familiar with regency cant, and there are actually fan sites out there with glossaries of regency slang used in her books.	2003-02-11

Sherrilyn Kenyon gets better and better with this first novel in her Dark-Hunter series.<br />'Night Pleasures' is a great read, full of the spirited characters that have come to be one of Ms. Kenyon's trademarks.  She mixes Greek mythology, vampires, and a magickally eccentric family that makes the gals on 'Charmed' look like The Waltons.<br />Kyrian of Thrace is every woman's wet dream, but Ms. Kenyon infuses him with so much humanity that he doesn't come off as being a typical cardboard romantic hero.  I'd have to say that he is a hybrid alpha-beta male.  He's charming, loyal, brave, infuriating and sexy as all hell.<br />Amanda, like her sister Grace (whom hopefully you've met by now from 'Fantasy Lover') is a spunky heroine who believes herself blessedly 'normal', and likes it that way.  Of course, it's always the ones who swear they're normal who turn out to be anything but.<br />I love the fact that Ms. Kenyon's heroines are unashamedly sexual, and they enjoy oogling over gorgeous men.  And from the description of Kyrian in the book, I certainly wouldn't toss him out of my bed for eating crackers!<br />Though at first glance this novel might come off as another vampire romance, Ms. Kenyon creates an entirely new mythos for our favourite undead creatures.<br />There are gods and goddesses with typical bad attitudes, a psychotic demigod with a serious need to talk with Sigmund Freud, a Squire with a taste for hacking and grunge fashion, who just so happens to drive a Jaguar, and an old woman who makes some rather lethal dolls.<br />For those of us who loved Grace and Julian, they're back too, with kids.  By the way, Julian still hasn't quite figured out how to drive a car.<br />Oh, and did I mention that this book has some really funny moments, like when Amanda wakes up handcuffed to the insanely gorgeous Kyrian?<br />Oh, and I forgot to mention that Kyrian is about two-thousand years old and has mastered modern slang.  For those of us a little tired of the typical 'old-world' bloodsucker.<br />A fun romp, and now I eagerly await Talon's story.

Though short, it is an elegantly witty work of high fantasy with characters I came to love.<br />Now, Ellen Kushner and her partner, Delia Sherman, have once again delighted my literary palate with 'The Fall of the Kings'. This novel is as rich as a Pre-Raphaelite painting, full of lush hues and romantic themes.<br />'The Fall of the Kings' is full of so many multifacted characters to love, to dislike and to ardently sigh over--Theron, the wonderfully charming, decadent, shamelessly self-indulgent, warm and idealistic son of Alec, from 'Swordspoint'; Basil St. Cloud, the handsome and charismatic young scholar with his longing for truth and passion for the past--and for Theron; The Lady Sophia could easily give her ancestress, Diane of Tramontaine a good fight. Where Diane's motivations were more mysterious, Sophia is quite open when it comes to wielding power. And of course, who could forget Theron's sister, Lady Jessica, the beautiful and ruthless pirate queen.<br />Even the ghost of Richard St. Vier makes a small spectral appearance.<br />Add to this heady mix raucous university students, dueling professors, hidebound scholars, men in elegant frocks, women in shimmering gowns, a heartless paintrix, ancient lore and buried secrets, and 'The Fall of the Kings' becomes the kind of novel that envelopes you in its many layers.<br />Like 'Swordspoint', the eroticism is subtle, allowing the reader to savor the intimate moments between Theron and Basil. Kushner and Sherman do not go into details, and as excellent storytellers, they do not need to.<br />'The Fall of the Kings' is another masterwork of high fantasy--a world that once visited is very hard to forget.	2002-12-20
US	50040748	R12DO96083YBXB	0380782308	138739167	Awaken, My Love	Books	4	1	2	N	N	The First, and Not the Last	Keeping in mind that this was Ms. Schone's first book, I rated it four-stars.  I know what she is capable of as a writer, and this novel only hinted at the deep storytelling that was to come in subsequent books and shoter works.<br />The opening of the novel was definitely an eye-opener, and I enjoyed the unusual plot device. I don't understand why some publishers balked at a depiction of the heroine pleasuring herself.  Considering that practically every type of coupling  is allowed in romances these days, I really don't see what all the fuss was about.  Ms. Schone also depicted foreplay during menustration, another radical concept.<br />I also liked Elaine, the heroine--basically for the same reasons that I have liked all of Ms. Schone's female protagonists:  She is not some perfect size six who has never been touched.  Elaine's problem is that she just hasn't been touched the way she wants to be--a situation that many women actually face.  Elaine is a woman who is sexual, but is stunted from fully enjoying sex by a husband who just doesn't get it.<br />An amusing moment of the book is Elaine's discovery that nineteenth century women didn't shave their legs.<br />That being said--the out-of-body situation was a little nonsensical, and it was difficult to figure out just what was going on.  The male protagonist, Charles, was definitely a man on the edge, and it took quite a bit of time for me to warm up to him.<br />Ms. Schone played a little with the gothic trope of the madwoman in the attic, except that Elaine is quite sane.  Morrigan's relatives were quite heinous, and I was waiting for Elaine with her twentieth century sensibilities to take them down a notch.<br />'Awaken, My Love' was not Ms. Schone's best book, but it is highly readable.  Just know that her style gets better with each new novel.	2002-12-20

Charlotte Carter gives us Nanette Hayes, a fresh new voice in the world of detective fiction.<br />Nanette Hayes may be smart and sassy, but she's rather directionless.  Armed with a master's degree in French, a love for Paris, a taste for Rimbaud, a refined palate on a beer budget, and a true love affair with jazz, she spends her days playing saxaphone on the streets of a New York that Ms. Carter captures so lyrically.<br />This novel reminded me of the seminal French film 'Diva', with all the plot twists and unusual characters - crooked cops, $60,000 stashed inside a saxaphone, an elegant yet aging criminal who worships Charlie Parker, and a no-nonsense exotic dancer with a taste for Wall-Street investments. Oh, and a gay lower-level mobster who becomes Nanette's confidente of sorts.<br />The story centers around the urban legend of the Rhode Island Red, a saxaphone that was supposedly given to Charlie Parker from a mobster as a bribe to play at a wedding.  A saxaphone that was reportedly filled with heroin.<br />Charlotte Carter writes in the breezy rhythmic style of a jazz musician, and the book was a joy to savor.  I can't wait to get my hands on the next book, 'Coq Au Vin'.  Our heroine goes to Paris...ooh la la!	2002-10-04

Ms. Cole did such a remarkable job of bringing Denise Adams and Ian Phillips to life, I felt as if I might have known them.  While reading this book, I found myself talking back to Denise when she discovered just how much she liked Ian--people on the bus probably thought I'd lost it. My heart ached for Ian when Denise broke off their relationship.  I booed her sister Lynn, with her narrow-minded attitudes (I wanted to slap her silly).<br />Ms. Cole realistically dealt with the uncertain terrain that often comes with an interracial relationship, although some of the attitudes I found distasteful, especially coming from blacks, who know better than most how damaging prejudice can be.<br />I also liked the fact that Denise was more of a bookish-computer nerd type, rather than the typical &quot;strong black woman&quot;. After all, there's many types of strength, and she proved it when she decided that Ian was the man for her. Of course, Ian was the kind of man that every woman wants, no matter what colour he is.<br />I will be reading this book again, and hopefully, not as fast.  I want to savor each page.	2002-09-26

In the pantheon of feisty female detectives, Rosemary Edghill's Karen Hightower (aka Bast) definitely deserves a place.  While a few books with characters who are wiccans tend to go overboard trying to prove how \\"normal\\" they are, Bast gets down to the brass tacks of the \\"craft\\" as it were, and shows us that hey, not only is there no single tradition, but wiccans (or if you prefer the term witch), bring a great deal of outside baggage with them. Just the realism of being a wiccan in the day to day world is worth the price of the book alone.<br />However, Bast is not only a witch, she just so happens to be a detective, and not really by design. Of course, she knows not to get involved with murder and mayhem, but somehow, she just can't help herself.<br />She's got a quirky cast of friends who remind me of some people I know.<br />I love her wry assessments about everything, from New York (her apartment is the size of a cookie box), her job, men, and of course, her beliefs.  She's also very resourceful, and rather determined.	2002-08-17

She doesn't break new ground, but does explore concepts like gender equality, religious intolerance and homosexuality in a way that isn't preachy.<br /><br />The world of The Stone Prince resembles Renaissance Europe, and the country of Branion is a thinly-disguised England.<br /><br />Prince Demnor of Branion isn't the typical too-perfect hero, which makes him a fascinating character.  He's quite flawed, and in some ways, behaves like a spoiled brat.  Then again, when one is descended from a family gifted with a flame-like power that if not mastered, would either drive one insane or burn them from the inside out.<br /><br />Demnor's lover, Kelahanus, is a Companion--a rather intriguing blend of lover, spy and assassin.  His job, outside of keeping the prince happy, is also to insure that Demnor did his duty as heir, and in doing so, avoid civil war with the second most powerful family in Branion.<br /><br />The characters were deftly drawn, and it was eye-opening, to say the least, that the female characters could be just as bloodthirsty and ruthless as the men.  Melisendra, the Aristok of Branion (and Demnor's mother), could show Xena how to fight  and win battles.  As a mother, however, she will not win any awards, since she equates love with weakness.<br /><br />The Stone Prince was an enjoyable read, and a great beginning from a new talent.	2002-08-06

She writes novels of emotional depth and searing sexuality, with characters who are not perfect in either body or spirit.  Yet in every piece of fiction Ms. Schone writes, has as its overall theme, the redemptive power of love.<br />Some readers might take offense at the supposedly stereotyped vision of Arab men as sexually voracious and adept lovers; however keep in mind the novel takes place in Victorian England, and precious little was known (much less did the Victorians care), about the Muslim world.<br />Elizabeth, the main character, is a woman typical of her era.  She the proper wife of a politician, and the mother of two boys.  She should be satisfied with her lot, and yet, she feels her life to be devoid of passion.  Enter Ramiel, the son of an English countess and an Arab sheik.  Ramiel has the reputation amongst the beau monde as a lover without equal, and he has become nothing more than a toy for bored noblewomen cuckolding their husbands.<br />Elizabeth persuades Ramiel to take her as his student in the arts of love, in order for her to seduce her husband.  The subsequent chapters where the two discuss the techniques described in a copy of The Perfumed Garden are the most erotically tense ever written.<br />Like some of her previous novels, homosexuality figures prominently, and some readers might find it offensive.  Once again, keep in mind that in Victorian England, homosexuality was a criminal act, subject to imprisonment.<br />Ramiel and Elizabeth were two people I felt such an affinity for, and they stayed with me long after I finished the book.<br />Robin Schone has become a champion of a woman's right to sexual expression, and her novels explore this idea with sensitivity and empathy.	2002-08-06

Abigail was a soon-to-be-married ex-spinster who seeks the one thing denied to many women in Victorian England--passion.  Robert was a wounded soldier just returned from war to a country that seems to have no place for him.  They are two people bound by the need to be loved and to be accepted.<br />The sexual scenes were hot and full of emotional intensity, and I was delighted to see that Ms. Schone dealt with all forms of intimacy, not just ones that are accepted.  She doesn't write lurid prose with silly metaphors for male and female genitalia.<br />This is the story that I can read over and over again and still feel the same emotional connection.  I can't say this enough, that Robin Schone is the new queen of erotic romance.	2002-08-06

From page one, I was absolutely hooked.  This Cinderella is so far and above the whimpering Disney model, and for that I was glad.  This princess knew exactly what she wanted.  She was strong, courageous and resourceful every step of the way.<br />This book contained so many important lessons for girls and women of all ages.  Lessons about love, about being true to one's dreams, and about going for one's goals.<br />It's nice to know Prince Charming wasn't as charming.<br />I can already hear the backlash, that Just Ella is nothing more than a feminist slant on a classic faerie tale.  But if you know anything about the genre, faerie tales in their original form were not the warm and fuzzy stories we've been over staurated with.  The original tales were dark and rather forbidding in tone.  They were life lessons.<br />My niece will be reading this book quite soon, and I will be giving copies to every young girl I know.

Rage because these people threaten the security of all Americans, no matter their color.	2002-07-01

This is the first one I've read, and it was pretty enjoyable.<br />Except...it seemed to me that Francesca's first experience with Gabriel was forced.  I enjoy power plays between men and women, but this appeared to me a throwback to the old 'rape me and I'll love you forever' scenarios so prevalent in the early 80's.<br />Francesca was a character I liked, though I wish she'd a bit more spirit where Gabriel was concerned.<br />Gabriel wasn't too far from the typical romantic hero trope, but he was likeable just the same. His concern for his twin Lucian was believable.<br />Basically, the Carpathian males are just the way romance readers for the most part like their men--strong, silent and protective.	2002-05-22

And more than likely, I'll be reading the last one as well.<br />I forgot to mention my problem about the characterization of Rain's sister Beni from the first book.  Why was the darker-skinned sister portrayed as the troublemaker?  I think the Andrews ghost-writers need a little sensitivity training (amongst other things).  Talk about catering to stereotypes.<br />Was I hoping that somehow, the ghost writer(s) would vindicate themselves by allowing Rain to become more than a single-dimensional figure?<br />I was obviously asking for way too much.<br />The tawdry tale thus far...Rain Arnold ends up in London, once again taking the world by storm (no pun intended).  On her way to theatrical bliss, she finds her real father, gets laid twice, and discovers that her psycho uncle likes to play dress-up with little maids in a dollhouse.<br />Meanwhile, back at home, Rain has become a filthy rich heiress, and her real family isn't thrilled in the least.<br />Haven't we done this already?<br />Not that I'm a prude, but what's this with all the unsafe sex?  Why can't a V.C. Andrews novel feature a female character who isn't dropping her panties in every third or fourth chapter? I don't mind sex in a novel when it makes sense, like in romances, where there are two people expressing love in a physical way.<br />And I'm sorry, but Rain having sex with her brother/not brother is the height of tacky.  It may have worked for shock value in the Dollenganger Series, but like much of the V.C. Andrews staples, has become too predictable.<br />Are there some unresolved issues in the Andrews' family that should be coming out?<br />Let me give the writers of this stuff a word of advice.  If you're looking to emulate the great gothic novelists of the past, do yourselves a favour and READ THEM!	2002-05-16

The only reason I purchased a copy of this book is to see how well a black lead character would fare in a V.C. Andrews novel.  I admit it, I'll be reading the next two as well.<br />I should have known better than to expect anything than trite stereotypes.  Rain Arnold, hardworking black girl from the ghetto (why are all black people assumed to be 'from the ghetto'?) with a long-suffering mother, a wild sister, a strong brother and a father for an alcoholic.  Where have we heard this all before?  I thought it was from one of Oprah's books.<br />I know that a V.C. Andrews novel is the literary equivalent of a Twinkie--bad for you but, oh so very good--but my sweet tooth just went sour after finishing this book.  And finish it I did, hoping against hope that Rain Arnold would become a character I could have a modicum of sympathy for.<br />Doesn't it get tiresome using the same scenario ad nauseaum?<br />The big secret-Rain finds out that she's half-black because her real mother, Megan Hudson Randolph, is filthy rich and white.<br />Rain finds out that her real mother couldn't keep her because a half-black child conceived out of wedlock would have been an embarrassment to her upper-crust family.<br />Rain's \\"brother\\" Roy suddenly finds himself attracted to his sister/not blood sister.<br />Rain finds herself living with her real family, the Hudsons, who are fabulously wealthy and absolutely dysfunctional.

Not, a great role-model for teenage girls.

Sadly, the romance genre has been rather slow at playing catch-up with modern times.<br />I enjoyed 'From the Ashes'.  First, the lead character, Paige, is a refreshing treat from the typical size six romance heroine.  She's a character that many women could relate to, considering the average woman in America wears a size 12 to 14.  I especially liked the way the authors described Paige's body type, both playful and affirming.  I loved the fact that Paige was a model.  I'd like to see more romance authors be as bold.<br />The fact that there was a conflict of cultures--namely that of Linc's and of Paige's, was eye-opening to say the least. And the conflict wasn't sugar-coated.<br />I am extremely thankful that at least ONE romance publishing company has the guts and the savvy foresight to take romance to the next level.  I'm also looking forward to more books by these two writers.	2002-03-20

We're not tied to hidebound notions of &quot;the way things should be&quot;; rather we are far more interested in the way things &quot;could be&quot;, or &quot;might have been&quot;.<br />Kushiel's Dart is part alternative history, part romance, and part (albeit small) magical journey.<br />Phaedre no Delaunay is one of those intriguing heroines who stretches the limits of what a heroine should be.  Is she merely a passive plaything at the hands of a master manipulator, or is she a subtle player in a larger game that even the reader is unaware of?  Like Michael Moorcock's intriguing albino, Elric, Phaedre is also blessed/cursed with a rather interesting &quot;gift&quot;, and it is the use of this &quot;gift&quot; that forms much of the crux of the novel.<br />There is a rather intriguing take on the Christian faith, and one that may incite hyper-sensitive readers.  All others will find it thought-provoking.<br />This is author Jacqueline Carey's first novel, and she is to be commended for writing a multi-faceted novel that takes the reader beyond what a fantasy book can be.  This is a huge and lush novel that is to be savored in small bits, and enjoyed like a box of truffles.  I am left wanting more from this author, and I am certain that any first time readers will be feeling the same way.	2001-12-06

In my posting, I mentioned the character of Vanyel as an example one of the first gay male heroes in fantasy fiction.<br />However, this book is far more than just a story about his sexuality.  In many ways, I see it as the precursor to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.  Vanyel is a young man with rare talents who doesn't fit in with the hidebound nations of family and friends.  At great personal cost he tries to be like everyone else and cannot.<br />Good fantasy fiction, like science fiction, often presents to the reader real-life challenges wrapped inside a mythical or fantastical setting.  A well-drawn character is a mirror in which our own struggles as human beings is reflected.  I could very well relate to Vanyel's struggles for acceptance, as could many other readers.  Ms. Lackey succeeds in infusing Vanyel with so much depth that I found myself hurting when his family dismisses him, and cheering when he meets his lifelong companion, Yfandes.<br />Yfandes, Vanyel's equine &quot;companion&quot; always reminded me of a cross between Mother Love and Dear Abby, without the mulishness.  She's tough, savvy and very forgiving.  I would definitely like to have her on my side in a fight.<br />The standard tropes of fantasy are played to the hilt, but those are not what makes Magic's Pawn the classic work that it is.  It is that very depth and perception of the characters that place this novel above the rest, and why so many readers have taken this book to their hearts.<br />In my posting, I said that romance has a long way to go before it can ever be at the level that a book such as Magic's Pawn has reached.	2001-12-06

Nearly thirty years later, I still re-read this series and it takes me back to my dreams.<br />The true test of a novelist is to make one think, and to open the doors of perception.  Ms. McCaffrey, like Marion Zimmer Bradley and other writers I adore, have done this with great skill and boundless imagination.<br />Lessa of Pern has always been a role-model of sorts; tough, feisty, a true survivor, and a woman with her own mind.  She and F'lar are a wonderful example of how a relationship between two people should work.  Masterharper Robinton will always be my sage mentor.  Brekke and F'nor are one of my favourite couples, and no matter how many times I read this series, I still get misty eyes when all works out well for them.  And Lord Jaxom was my very first romantic hero--I had the biggest crush on him in junior high school!<br />This is a classic fantasy series that ages gracefully, and is still enjoyable after nearly three decades.	2001-11-28

I totally cheered when she ran away to live alone in a cave, with only her music and a gaggle of fire lizards as company.<br />Hey, at one point in time, that didn't seem like such as bad idea to me.<br />One of the best parts of the book is Menolly surviving on her own--taken right out of some boy scout handbook, Menolly fends for herself, and Ms McCaffrey, whether aware or not, gave young girls like me a heroine to truly look up to.<br />Like the companion 'Dragonriders of Pern', this is a classic series that lives and breathes.

The Mists of Avalon is a glorious retelling of the Arthurian saga by one of its most maligned characters--that of Morgan le Fay.<br /><br /> To call this book a &quot;feminist fable&quot; is to do it a great injustice, and frankly, lends itself to charges of sexism. No one calls Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur a paen to masculine virtues; historically speaking, Malory's work was greatly influenced by Eleanor of Aquitaine's famous Courts of Love. Any spurious charges of feminism leveled against Ms. Bradley's book merely rise from the fact that the main characters of the book are all the women behind Arthur's throne; Morgan (called Morgaine in the novel), Guinevere (Gwenhyfar), and Viviane, Lady of the Lake.<br /><br /> Morgaine has emerged as one of my all-time favourite characters in literature; she is a complex woman both ahead of her time, and yet greatly of her time. Gwenhyfar is just as complex, and at first reading, is a thoroughly disagreeable character. That is, until one realizes that she too, is as much a woman of her times. Much of Ms. Bradley's genius lay in her ability to fully flesh out her characters, to make them real to the reader.<br /><br /> This novel also introduced many to the idea of a goddess-centered spirituality (i.e. paganism/wicca) without being preachy. To be honest, I found Morgaine's path to be just as trying and just as demanding as Christianity is to its adherents.<br /><br /> A few detractors have claimed that Mists of Avalon was/is a &quot;recruitment guide&quot; to feminist spirituality, and that Christianity was painted as a hateful religion--unfortunately, these people are the victims of their own biases. Much of early Christianity was rather backwards in its views of women (a view which sadly hasn't progressed all that greatly). To be fair, Ms. Bradley once again proved her impeccable scholarship in showing the ties that early Christianity and the pagan faiths of Old Britain shared--the story of Joseph of Arimathea, who supposedly founded the first church upon Glastonbury Tor, and who worshipped alongside the Druids. She wrote of Pre-Nicean Christianity, which did not seem to have any issues with the pagans of Britain. Still, put oneself in Morgaine's shoes--having to defend one's beliefs against ignorance and superstition (though it was that same 'superstition' that many called on when it came to tending the sick because of her vast knowledge of herb lore). Morgaine was forced to defend even the basic freedoms of women (to be learned) against those who felt that women were not 'created' to read and write.<br /><br /> I also see the problem some of the detractors have is in our very Western notion of 'good gys v. bad guys'. Many people like things simplified, and to read a book that doesn't wrap everything up in a tidy little box has got to be rather disappointing. 'The Mists of Avalon' transcended this outdated notion, peopling its pages with characters who are just as 'real' and as multifacted in their emotions as we ourselves are. As I said before, I no longer have the animosity towards Gwenhyfar that I did when I first read the book many years ago. Now when I re-read 'Mists', she has come to earn my pity and my understanding. And in her own way, she too was a very strong and determined woman.<br /><br /> I have read this book about a good 100 times (I'm not kidding), and with each re-read, I come away with more insight into the human condition. This is a novel that should be read and shared and discussed by everyone. It should be judged for the quality of the writing and for the depth of characterization it brings, both which are immense, and a lasting tribute to the brilliant mind who penned it.ties that early Christianity and the pagan faiths of Old Britain shared--the story of Joseph of Arimathea, who supposedly founded the first church upon Glastonbury Tor, and who worshipped alongside the Druids.

I was trying very hard not to be offended at yet another white male fantasy of what black women are about, even one written by a man in an interracial marriage.<br />Renee, for all her supposed education and sophistication, was a tiresome character, and her personality was far from being amusing. In fact, she came off rather ignorant, especially when it came to trying Italian cuisine for the first time. I mean, did the woman live in a vacuum?  It seemed that Renee had never enjoyed a pizza or spaghetti before.  If Roanoake, VA is that backwards, I for one most certainly wouldn't want to live there.<br />Renee's views of Italians came off as biased and prejudicial. Her comments about Giovanni having a &quot;smell&quot; that she found distasteful was bothersome. Does the author really believe that most black people in America have never been around Italians?  Has the author ever lived in New York, or somewhere a tad more cosmopolitan?<br />To me, Renee came off as selfish and far more concerned about what other people might think about her growing relationship with Jay, and less about her own true feelings. I was very disturbed by her refusal to allow Jay to hold her hand or bestow a kiss on her in public because she didn't want anyone to see them together.<br />In many ways she was petty and juvenile, and if I had been Giovanni, I'd have married someone who had their heads on a little straighter than &quot;sister girl&quot; Renee. Renee's overbearing mother and best friend left a lot to be desired as well.<br />Giovanni was too typically the &quot;romantic&quot; hero and he could have used a lot more guts. The entire &quot;hip-hop&quot; poet aspect, also left me feeling a little unsure. It seemed almost contrived somehow, as if the author was trying to convince the reader that Giovanni's interest in Renee was sincere.<br />The only decent characters with any sort of warmth and likeability were Giovanni's father and sister, who was a lesbian. Their reunion was probably the most touching moment in a book rather bereft of them.<br />Being in an interracial relationship myself, Renee's behavior just reinforces my belief that some people simply are not emotionally mature enough to handle going against the grain.  For myself, the only happiness I care about is that of my partners' and my own.  The rest of the world can go hang.<br />I will say, in spite of my disatisfaction with much of the novel, I still read it in two days, the only reason being the lack of interracial romances in general.<br />This book has also given me impetus to write an interracial romance of my own, because it shows me the mistakes NOT to make.in Renee was sincere.<br />The only decent characters with any sort of warmth and likeability were Giovanni's father and sister, who was a lesbian.

Like her previous short works and novels, neither Gabriel or Victoria are the stereotypical romance couple.  Gabriel, a former prostitute and now owner of an exclusive brothel that bears his name, is a man tormented by an act so tragic, that it has shaped him into the untouchable being he now is.  Wealthy women will pay any price for his services, but he knows they would never pay the price for loving the man he truly is, nor would they wish to see that part of him.<br />Victoria is a dimissed governess whose only crime was that of not responding to a former employer's advances--a situation that was quite the norm in Victorian England.  She boldly offers her virginity up for auction inside The House of Gabriel, and commands a staggering sum in the process.<br />Ms. Schone's use of the gothic style harkens one back to the great gothic novels of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Nearly everything that occurs in this novel happens at night, or in the dark.  Strangers from the past, mysterious motives, and the dark deeds that belie the gentility of Victorian England are woven skillfully.<br />Gabriel could teach Jane Eyre's Mr. Rochester a thing about brooding heroes; and like Rochester, he too finds deliverance from the steadfast love of a woman who is as strong as himself.  Victoria is a wonderful character, and no shrinking violet--she may not know what will come about in the end, but she dares what other women will not--to love a man with too many scars upon his soul.<br />His best friend Michael des Anges (from Ms. Schone's previous novel, 'The Lover') is scarred on his face;  Gabriel is scarred both body and spirit.<br />An interesting note:  There is an undercurrent of deep and fierce love between Gabriel and Michael, one that would suggest an almost homosexual bond.  Like the frank eroticism, some readers may be put off by this, but I think Ms. Schone handles this matter wonderfully.  In fact, I think their relationship goes beyond our notions of love between men, to see a deep and lasting committment that was forged in the most frightful of circumstances.<br />The eroticism in 'Gabriel's Woman' is sexuality the way it should be written--passionate and intense.  Ms. Schone's scenes drew me in and kept me there.  Her atmosphere drips with the sounds, scents and sometimes overwhelming emotions of sex.  In the shower scene (which I think was wonderfully written), I actually felt as if I were a voyeur, sharing this frightningly intense moment between two souls, and not merely two bodies.<br />That, I believe, is what makes Robin Schone far superior to what has come before in the genre of erotic romance.  Ms. Schone doesn't write textbook manuals on the act of sex, nor does she pepper her descriptions with silly metaphors ascribed to the various male and female genitalia (you readers who read steamy romances know exactly what I mean).  Robin Schone writes about the emotions of two people who are making love; we see inside of them, and in some ways, become them, in their lust and in their longing.<br />Once again, Robin Schone has delivered a romantic tour-de-force, a novel that will spark lively and much needed debate.  I am recommending all of her books to any woman I see with a romance novel in her hands.  I am also recommending her books to men who think they've got the exclsuive rights to anything frank and explicit.one handles this matter wonderfully.

To be frank, hers was the only story in the book worth reading.<br />Just as she has done previously, Ms. Schone's characters are not the typical &quot;flaxen-haired wenches&quot; and &quot;virile Vikings&quot; most of us have come to expect from this genre.  Her characters are wonderfully flawed, and one cannot help but to hope that by the end of the book, they find happiness together.<br />More importantly, Ms. Schone gleefully challenges us as women to define sexy on our own terms.  There will be some women out there who've never experienced anal sex, and may be a bit curious as to &quot;how the other half lives&quot;, so to speak.  She is an outspoken advocate for the right of women to be free in expressing themselves sexually, and instead of castigating her, she is to be commended for taking such a brave stance, especially in these politically correct times.<br />'Gabriel's Woman' is a darker novel in tone, and that very gothic element is what lends itself so well to erotica.	2001-10-03

Elric is one of fantasy's most intriguing characters, and has sparked some rather heated debates as to whether or not he can be defined as a &quot;hero&quot; in the classic sense. (I say yes).<br />Elric is NOT, Conan, for which many of us with literary leanings can be profoundly grateful.  Michael Moorcock took fantasy out of its typical milieu and gave it a sense of epic storytelling with thought-provoking ideas of good and evil, of order and chaos. Elric prototypes now abound in the realm of fantasy fiction, which has been a good thing.<br />My fondest wish has always been to explore further the mysterious island kingdom of Melnibone, since its denizens were just as fascinating as the title character himself.	2001-07-06

Ellen Kushner's first novel sets the standard for what a polite fantasy of manners and romance should be. Like Jane Austen, Ms. Kushner's language sparkles with wit and verve. She creates a world both familiar and yet not like anyplace we've ever been and inhabits it with characters who cease to be imaginary.  Like Mr. Sabatini, the swordfight scenes keep one on the edge of their seat, though are elegantly restrained yet sharply honed.<br /><br />Richard St. Vier is as dashing and gallant as Basil Rathbone and Errol Flynn, and as just complex.  He kills for hire, yet has a poetic soul and a certain code of honor, which includes not taking commissions in which children or women are to be harmed. His companion, the mysterious Alec - once a student at University, now 'slumming' on the other side of the river, has a definite taste for danger though he can barely handle himself.  He's wry, sarcastic and perhaps a little unhinged. The alluring Diane, Duchess of Tramontaine is one of literature's cleverest femme fatales, and I would love to see an entire novel written about her.  She comes off as completely uninterested in anything outside of her little social milieu, a facade that fools nearly everyone around her.<br /><br />I'm a little appalled that some critics of the book make much of the novel's take on homosexuality, to the point that they did not enjoy such a well-crafted tale.  I think these readers forget this is not a social treatise, but a work of fantasy fiction and as such, Ms. Kushner doesn't have to deeply examine the whys and wherefores of her imagined society's tolerance.  To be honest, I found Ms. Kushner's treatment of the fluid sexuality of her characters to be passionate yet tasteful.  She doesn't write erotica, but allows the reader to imagine the power of the various couplings.  Bottom line - good fantasy fiction allows us to immerse ourselves in places and times not our own, and if one brings their silly baggage and hangups with them, they do a great disservice to the writer...and to themselves.<br /><br />My only issue with 'Swordspoint'...it was far too SHORT.

This book rocks...no pun intended.  Jorandel, the elf-rock star reminds one of some of music's greatest tragedies, and Rose,  the feisty human PI is fantasy's answer to VI Warshawski.  There's a great  deal of wisdom and insight to the human (and elven) condition.	2000-05-24

Unlike many science-fiction writers, she spends no time discussing the dynamics of time travel, which for a tale of this emotional magnitude, is a good thing.  Kindred is hard book to read and it leaves you with so many questions; I  have never looked at history in quite the same way.  That is the hallmark  of good writing, when it leaves you with much to think about.  Also,  Octavia Butler was the only black woman writing science fiction at the  time, and so she became a role model to me.	2000-02-17
