In this latest Yancey book he touches the theme of Faith in something unseen but elemental to our survival as Christians. Where is God, how do we KNOW him &amp; his plan for our lives? By using examples of others searches including his own. Yancey helps us explore this Dark to Light transition we all go through with emphasis on what we can find on the other side. It helped me a great deal to know I wasn't the only Christain to fall into draught in my realationship with my Lord, that many much greater than I have struggled down this path again &amp; again. It is possible we all will again, this doesn't mean the end of our faith just another learning step to our walk. Most likely the changes, doubts &amp; failures won't stop happening until we leave these mortal clay vessels. We are loved &amp; forgiven &amp; saved anyway. Blessed be, L&lt;&gt;&lt;	2002-02-12

Certainly separated the Sunday School pablum from the true meat of the scriptures. Refreshing, thought provoking, best of all interesting. I really apperciated the references made to other Christian wrtiers &amp; their views on the same subject. Having their thoughts added even more insight. I feel a bit better knowing that even Jesus's followers didn't always &quot;Get It&quot; &amp; floundered in the begining. Blessed be,  L&lt;&gt;&lt;	2002-02-12

Talk of Morality is just a small part of this book, Honor, Truth, Justice, Race, all play in the Theme. None of the &quot;Scared Goats&quot; are spared, &amp; alot of toes stepped on. WHY? Because it seems people  &quot;Want what they want&quot;, No Matter if it is RIGHT or the cost to  others. Must one be &quot;Jewish&quot; understand or agree with Prager? I  don't think so, all the great religions of the world are based on MORALS  &amp; have that in common with each other.

Great fast paced story line, wonderfully  detail drawn people and a very fine mystery. Lots of &quot;Southern  Color&quot;, both positive and negative. Quite a page turner, but I never  wanted it to be over. I fell madly in &quot;LOVE&quot; with Miz Sidden's  Bloodhounds. I certainly want more books with these interesting people,  places and the beloved hounds. Please Ms. Lanier write faster!	2000-05-23

While I not sure JoBeth and I would be best buddies, I can see why she is so prickly. I too live down here with those &quot;Southern Boys&quot; So well woven, all the plot lines and sub plots. 10 suspects, ala Madam A....  Skillfully put together and never boring. I never saw the  &quot;Villians&quot; or the ending coming! As always wonderful Bloodhounds  and lore. I want my own BobbyLee!	2000-05-22

Is it really ALL how we view what is happening to us? The Dalai Lama shows it is. Is that too simplistic, try living it. Simple dosen't apply as much as UNDERSTANDING, Sense of Self, Worth &amp; Our places in the Universe. Is  this easy, some parts more than others. Since I truly believe, I have  control of How I perceive &amp; react to things happening to me &amp;  around me, this book was a confirmation  of THE POWER  we have. Fear &amp;  feeling of being Powerless colors every thing we do. Here is a way to break  with those chains, that make us impotent in our lives. One doesn't need to  be Buddhist to use the Dalai Lama's words, this work does not interfer with  any other doctrine. I think this book will only add to ones life, for every  small change adds a slight ripple(improvement)to our ponds. LIFE IS NOT  MEANT TO BE STATIC. Blessed be.	2000-05-15

This book has everything I want &amp; need in a Great Mystery. Maybe it's being from the south , or having dogs of my own.... but I think that is a very small part of why this  book applealed to me. I enjoyed getting to know about Blood Hounds and more  on tracking. I'm a very good &quot;book sleuth&quot; and I hadn't guessed  the ending half way through. The &quot;Cast&quot; of regulars are so well  drawn that they are now important neighbors that I care about. So beware  read this and you too will be &quot;rabid&quot; to get your hands on the  rest of this series, as I now do. ah, ENJOY!	2000-05-12

Hugger Mugger gets Spenser into new territory, adding a fresh interesting insights,... is Spenser just good with Pearl the Wonder Dog, Susan &amp; Hawk by his side? Do I miss the &quot;side kicks&quot; Yes, but not nearly as much as I expected. This is classic Spenser, hailing back before the  side-kicks were such a main stay. Very entertaining, well written with the  usual humor &amp; pithy dialogue that we have come to expect. Spenser's  code of honor is very real and strong through out this series and is in  full force here with a good dose of &quot;This is Right&quot;. So what is  the question?	2000-05-02

As one reads this book the impression is , &quot;Oh, Sure&quot; but as the information sinks in... &quot;It's Oh, Wow&quot; I CAN do this, and make a difference in my  own life. I was very impressed with the section of Health Problems, and  ways to improve them through diet and supplement,in short easy to  understand and follow suggestions. The idea of adapting and using different  Ethnic Diets was intrguing too.	2000-05-01

I felt this was truly provided in this book along with the information of Healing. Just reading this book, helped my  depression of long term illness that no Dr. could see, touch or give me a  Rx for. Getting older or gaining weight, being female did not cause these  health problems. Seeing other accounts of similar problems has given me a  place to start investigating just what is wrong with my health and so armed  with this information, I think can be the first step on the path to  wellness.	2000-05-01

I felt the &quot;Romance&quot; between Alex and Toni, flat and boring, the tenison ie:jealousy too contrived. Now the &quot;love&quot; interest with the teens had more substance and validity. I found the Cyber RW vs VR entertaining and some of the most interesting chapters of this book. I was also very  beguiled by the Russian assassin, felt his pain and sadness. Intrigued by  his abilities, what does it take to make a human into this kind of killing  machine? None of which was clearly answered in this book.	2000-04-29

This is just one more in the greatly entertaining line. Witness in Death, has all the makings of the &quot;Grand old writers&quot;.. in a Futristic setting:Sex, Humor, Sex, revisiting and  further development of surporting cast members, Sex, and of course plenty  of red herrings.... had me guessing till the end and as always waiting for  the next Rorake &amp; Eve saga...	2000-04-27

The menace just wasn't as strong as it needed to be.  Everything else was pure Saint-Germain and all we love about this vampire.  I got a good sense of the histoical locale, customs and the surport cast  was well drawn. Looking forward to her next novel. Brava!	2000-04-10
