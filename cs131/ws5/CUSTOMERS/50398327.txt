Detailed pictures and easy-to-follow instructions. It doesn't have the usual fluff to get you to buy the book, rather the author is sincere about his art, and the book reflected this.<BR>I borrowed a copy from the library to check it out before buying it, and liked it SO much I bought THREE copies - one for myself, one for my parents, and another for a friend who just got divorced. He faced too much stress and said the book helped him to focus and relax.	2003-03-14

I gave it two stars simply because it gives an alternative to what similar exercises can be done at home if you're not at the gym, or if you don't have access to a gym (while traveling, for example). But even this is not enough. It seems that the book is hastily compiled. I would like to comment also about the models used in the book - personally, the don't have the look of someone working out or anything, with the impractical long coiffed hair and all that, that sometimes hid an essential part of the form during the exercise, like the shoulder. It would be more realistic to dress them as regular gym-goers do - like tying their hair up, for example, instead of having them look as if they're going to a pub. It's just irritating and unappealing. <BR>Plus, I agree with what one of the readers said about bad form in the book. Like I said, this book could be improved.	2003-03-14

But somehow a friend of mine gave me \\"Seduction in mind\\", so I was like, what the heck. So I read it, with a very low expectation, so as to avoid being disappointed.<br />Surprisingly, it was not bad. It's okay, reminiscent of her earlier novels like \\"Pure Sin\\". I like the heroine's attitude - she does not sulk all the time, she is independent, she has pride, and she is not being unnecessarily difficult. I just don't like the fact that she poses nude for paintings. That was really TOO liberated, and yes, rather unsurprising that she invites 'lewdness'. <br />The hero, Sam, is okay too. Not too excessively self-centered, and is a widower. <br />What irritates me about this book :<BR>Farida and Mahmud. Egypt is too far-fetched. And the incestuous nature of their relationship is rather unnecessarily lewd. Doesn't contribute much to the story, so I wondered whether Johnson put it in just to spice things up, but she fails miserably. Farida and Mahmud have easily-forgotten roles that their plots can be eliminated from the book without any major consequences. There is not really much plot, if you read this book. I mean, the existence of Farida's manipulative greediness and all that is supposed to add intrigue, but I don't think so. It sounds so lame. <br />Like I said, if you have low expectations of this book, it's not so bad. Really. It's even quite nice.<br />The title is rather inappropriate, I guess. At first, I thought it was about a guy betting with his friends to see whether he can seduce a particular lady, but it turned out to be a much sweeter story than that. So maybe Johnson should change the title to reflect what the story is all about instead of putting lewd titles for advertisement/publicity purposes.	2002-06-21

For a 41-yr-old widely traveled, experienced man, he sure behaves like someone in his 20s. If not because of the age, Spencer is just fine, but since he's way beyond his 30s, he should BEHAVE like one. They way he talks, the way he thinks - he seems immature, and, considering this, I wonder why Jenna McCue really wants HIM to be the 'sperm donor' when she could've had her pick of OTHER men with MORE attributes. <br />So, that's why I give this only 4 stars. Otherwise, the story is very entertaining.	2002-04-24

I TOTALLY agree with the reviewer Vickie, from Sacramento, CA, about it. This is the ONLY story in the book that defines Erotic Romance. Oh, undeniably, all the other stories are erotic, but they are FAR from being romantic as well. Most are full of \\"Ah ah ahh\\"s, but nothing else, except degradation, bondage, etc, but no element of romance at ALL. <br />\\"A Lady's Pleasure\\" is beautiful, haunting, wistful. I find myself reading it over and over again, and NOT because of sex - but rather because it is memorable, it touches the heart in a longing, poignant way. <br />Kudos to Robin Schone.	2002-04-24

The moment when Lucian almost sacrificed his life so as not to turn vampire was very moving, and I found tears in my eyes. It was devastating to simply exist and not have hope to push you on in life. <br />Christine Feehan has this unique capability to entrance readers in all her Dark series. Even after reading this latest one in the series, I'm thirsty for more Christine Feehan books. I've read stories from other authors that have the tendency to get rather 'predictable' after a while, with repeated sentences (try and read a few Elizabeth Lowell books and you'll know what I mean...I don't mean to insult Lowell, I'm also a fan of hers, but after a while, there is a 'predicitability' and repeated quality in Lowell's books that I find cumbersome), but Feehan's books are very different - no predictable quality at all. In fact, she always managed to introduce new plots, fresh ideas, that get you hooked. Really hooked. What I love most is the 'element of surprise' in every Feehan novel. I am always caught by surprise everytime I read a new Dark novel, which makes me want to finish the book just to see what happens. <br />Congratulations on such an excellent effort. :) Can't wait for Lucian's story.	2002-04-07

Darius's story is full of INTENSITY. Everything about the book is intense, as if the writer was 'in her utmost prime' when she wrote it. Dark Fire is well-written, hauntingly beautiful, mystifyingly intense and at the same time, magnificently sensual. <br />A good read. Now I'm going to devour Dark Magic next.

I don't understand HOW she managed to slide down and continue sliding down towards this tacky abyss, when all this time her books have been elegantly written, with smashing repartee and marvelous wit. Her books of late (To please a lady, for instance) are so badly written that I wonder whether the author IS really Susan Johnson, or maybe she's doing the Milli Vanilli act - someone else is doing the writing, she just takes credit from it. So it was with this amount of skepticism that I picked up Temporary Mistress, hoping, really hoping that this one is gonna pull Ms Johnson out from the down-spiral. Let's just say I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. The story completely lacks flavor. It's tasteles, tacky and horrid. I don't feel empathy for the heroine, in fact, to me she's spoilt and a brat, as one of the reviewers suggested. For someone who is supposedly endowed with brains, she does not seem to possess maturity or common sense, and instead pouts to get her way. For someone so brainy, she sure uses the usual 'women's wiles' to do whatever she wants. And Dermott. Lord, he just doesn't strike a chord in me. For a brainy woman, the heroine falls hook, line and sinker for the usual depiction of dashing handsome man. Come on, Ms. Johnson, don't insult your readers by giving garbage like this. Well, I guess I'm your fan no more, Ms. Johnson. From this day onwards I'm never going to pick up your books again. Now your name seems to symbolise tastelessness and tackiness. Enough said.	2001-08-21

Amber Beach...rather bland, coz the focus was too much on the amber and less on the romance. Ironically, Ruby Bayou is also the same. The talk on rubies was too much I simply skipped the pages. It's ironic that the stories of Faith and Honor are more-or-less the same.<br />The book is also rather overdone. Russian Mafia, US mob, US government, and family secrets intermingle together, vying for space and attention in the book. It's too much. Overcrowded. And furthermore, I was rather disappointed by the fact that Faith should get somebody who is shorter than Jake (her twin Honor's husband), smaller than Jake or the Donovan men, and with no education. Okay, not having an education doesn't necessarily mean Owen Walker is stupid, but still..... it puts him down a level from the intimidating Donovan men, and also Jake Mallory.<br />Furthermore, Lowell didn't furnish the book with HOW the whole Donovan family would react to a match between Faith and Walker - employer's sister and employee. I was DYING to know their feelings on that and was vastly disappointed that Loweel didn't even put that in. In addition to that, so little of the other Donovans lives were put in. Example, in Jade Island, Kyle brought Lianne home to meet the family, and we were entertained with various family pranks and all that. In Pearl Cove, Archer brought Hannah home, and we were again presented with all the pleasures of the Donovan family life, with special note to the then new addition to the family, baby Summer, her cute antics, and the fact that Lianne was pregnant with twins. I din't see a similar thing in Ruby Bayou - well, a snippet of Summer and Robbie and Heather, but not much to satisfy the curiosity. All this time, I awaited the arrival of Ruby Bayou with bated breath, simply because I wanted to see how Faith turned out, yes, but also to see how Lianne and Kyle are faring with the twins, etc etc etc. We simply want to catch up on the family, but in Ruby Bayou, there was not enough of that.<br />So, all in all, the book &quot;Midnight in Ruby Bayou&quot; is really disappointing. Too twisted, too crowded, too less of what we want more of. Okay, maybe one can argue that since this is about rubies, it SHOULD talk about rubies. But don't forget, this is a romance first and foremost. If I want to know more about rubies, I can always go to some other book totally dedicated on rubies and rubies only.<br />So, Elizabeth, are you planning on writing about Jude and Lawe?	2001-07-31

First and foremost, the title shouldn't be &quot;wicked Widow&quot;. I was under the impression that WW is about a widow, and her life and all that. The story is about Vanza, a philosophy, and although it circulates around the life of the said widow, it is hardly about the widow herself.  I expected something light and fun, and beautiful, but got something different.  The romance between Artemus and the widow lacks passion. One wonders HOW the heck they manage to fall in love. Their conversation together is too formal, too starchy, too cold.  I'm giving it 3 stars not because it is very lousy, but because I felt that it would be better with a different title altogether.	2001-05-25

The storyline is basically the same - about a girl growing up in the worst slums of the city, and eventually becoming a lady. I must say Robards work is much more vivid and beautifully written.<br />For someone who has lived a rough life as a child, I am rather surprised and irritated that Violet didn't learn a single thing from her life as a poor person. She doesn't even have any street smarts. Her character is very disappointing, especially the part where she continuously hope for Blake's love - it's a display of a rather 'immature' and naive attitude, considering the fact that she grew up in the worst parts of town. Surely she is tougher than that??? I don't know what Blake sees in her, coz Violet doesn't even have a distinct character. It's as if she wants to be a totally new person altogether, wiping clean her past history, and in doing that wiping clean her own individuality as well. Seriously, what does Blake sees in her??? Furthermore, the book's portray of British English is rather unrealistic. I got bored of Violet's petulance, and the slowness of the whole plot, and skipped the whole thing altogether. Seriously, if you want a similar story, go for Karen Robards' \\"Loving Julia\\". It's funny, heartwarming and beautiful.	2001-05-04

I must say 'Loving Julia' is exactly what this book is about - loving Julia, the woman underneath, the lady she has become, the person she will always be - the spirited Jewel Combs. I truly enjoy her antics, her Cockney accent, her thoughts. She is funny, fun, and loving, and abhors pretentiousness, and speaks her mind.

The reason I gave this 4 stars is because I find the story too long in some parts and too short in others!!<br />The story is great, actually. Sebastien is a wonderful, sexy hero. I love the touch of French he has, the French accent, and gallantry. The plots unfolds naturally, as if the reader is actually witnessing the scenes.  However, I find the 'unfolding' of the scenes of Jamie and Sebastien rather tooooo long. In the beginning it was okay, but after a while, it gets stuffy. Now, what I found very lacking is the description of the scenes of Ree Ann and Angelo. When Sebastien tried matchmaking Ree Ann and Angelo, I found myself skipping pages, just to see how these two will turn out. I savor the few pages of Ree Ann and Angelo, coz THEIR part of the story seems more intriguing and flushed with sexual tension. It is wonderful how two enemies became lovers in the end.<br />I do not like how the story ends, with the voodoo priestess suddenly being summoned to free Sebastien from the 'curse'.

It's a pity that Sheila had to learn the lesson about men the hard way when her newly-married husband turned out to be a jerk. <br />I like Laredo, the American outlaw who joined the Mexican bandits. His whimsies about home, about eating cherry-topped sundae was really touching. You can actually feel his emotion, how much he missed home, and yet unable to return because he was a wanted man. I like Rafaga too, the outlaw leader, who was a very charismatic man. His mistress committed a crime which amounted to punishment, and despite his heavy heart and sadness, he continued on with the punishment. <br />Sheila, the Texan heiress, was rather petulant, for me. But I admire her survival spirit and courage. Not many would be like that in her position.<br />The ending, like all the Janet Dailey books I read so far was rather abrupt and left to the reader to contemplate further what happened next.<br />A great read.	2001-04-17

Oh, her other books (Zinnia, Orchid, Amaryllis) are okay, but somehow they sound the same once you read all three of them. 'After Dark' is rather different. <br />The first time I read this book, I was kinda frustrated with the fact that so many 'jargons' are introduced, that made the first few pages rather confusing and 'messy'. But when you go deeper into the book, you will be amazed at how the story unfolds - the ghost hunters, the ghosts, ghost duels, the illusion traps - very, very creative story-telling here.<br />Oh, and I especially love Lydia's pet dust bunny, Fuzz.

Oh, the story is okay, actually, not bad. A good read. But somehow it is not keeping to the title 'One wish'. The wish was reiterated at the end, like some sort of an afterthought - it was as if Miss Miller suddenly remembered the title and decided to hastily conclude the story with it.<br />And I don't like it when the Shardlow left and divorced his wife simply because of his notorious family name, only to come back to her a year later. If I were the woman, I'd slap and berate him first before accepting him with open arms. I mean, how DARED he put the woman in such a miserable, melancholic situation and asked her to marry another man just because he didn't think she would carry his name proudly?????<br />All in all, it's a pretty okay story, actually, but rather meandering.

I was totally immersed in the world created by the book itself, like watching a movie.<br />So, it was with great expectations that I picked up &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;. While it is not really a great disappointment, I find myself skipping pages. The story did not really give a lasting impression. It's ... okaaay, I guess. Not bad. But not that good either. <br />The dialogues are not as colorful as in &quot;Trust Me&quot;, and the characters a rather 'flat' and 'dull'.

I still have a lot of her books to devour.	2001-03-22

There are too many unnecessary characters that the whole thing seemed messy and confusing. To make matters worse, their roles are overlapping one another so much that they actually obscure that of the main characters. In a story, the roles of other characters should be 'muted' or downplayed a little bit so as not to shadow the hero and heroin. And secondly, the hero is a stupid, aimless man, who :    1) seeks respectability by thinking of marrying a socialite (not very macho, I must say. Rather sissy of him)    2) Bedded the supposed-to-be mistress of his old-friend due to revenge. This friend supposedly murdered the hero's fiance. After all that, the hero eventually realised that he actually didn't love his fiance and she's better off dead anyway! (Whatta man!! Clap clap clap)    3) Can't really make up his mind about something.     And to think the heroine still wants him...jeez, way to go, sister!! How desperate are you, that you settle for much less??    All in all, I thank God I only BORROWED this book from a friend.  Be warned, this book is DEFINITELY NOT worth your time and money.	2000-11-04

The book is quite okay, but the plots are very similar with her other 'Only' books. <br />It's okay for fun reading, but for keeps?  Naaah........ there are other Elizabeth Lowell's books  worth keeping. Not this one, sorry.	2000-06-18

Let metell you, Warrior's Woman is EXCELLENT! I've read it more than 50times and I still love it. It's very funny, crazy and sexy. You'll roll around laughing, believe me.  I LOVE the book. So that's why I look forward to reading 'Keeper of the Heart', to see what happened to the offsprings of the characters in 'Warrior's Woman'.  Boy, was I VERY disappointed!  'Keeper of The heart' is a very poor imitation of the parent book. There is no strength in plot, in fact, there's no serious plot at all! To me, Shanelle is weak, empty and airheaded. I skip the first few pages because it's boring. Then I started skipping more pages. Then I ended up throwing the book under the bed without even bothering to read the end. <br />So my advice? Read 'Warrior's woman' first. THEN read 'Keeper of The Heart' and you'll find yourself agreeing with me.	2000-06-18

To me, what makes her books a good read : her wonderful way of weaving the language - it's like reading a marvellously written poetry, the language is sooo elegant,  so quaint - in brief, BEAUTIFUL.     But this book is a MAJOR disappointment!  I even  checked the name on the cover several times, to check whether this is  REALLY Susan Johnson.  I hate the heroine. Trixie (the name itself is an  embarrassment in such sophiticated surroundings in the book) is soo...FRAIL  of willpower, succumbs so easily to temptation. I prefer the  strong,  intelligent and independent character of Flora Bonham in Pure Sin. And the  hero in this book is a total turnoff too. Oh yeah, he's very good-looking,  but he has no depth in character. He has an air of aimlessness,  irresponsibility. I prefer Adam Serre of Pure SIn - now THAT is a MAN. Or  Kit Braddock in Brazen. Those are good strong men, with brains to match.  The hero in this book seems to be an 'airhead'. I guess he is the perfect  match for this Trixie character, who, to me, is a bimbo. The storyline is  flat, the erotic scenes make up most of the pages of the book, which is disgusting after a while, and I find  myself losing interest after the first few pages. What a waste of  money.    I do not recommend this book to others. If you like to read  Johnson's books, I'd suggest Pure Sin, Brazen and even Wicked. You'll find  Susan Johnson in her element there, but not in this book.    I would rate  this book with \\"no Star\\" if that is possible.	1999-12-26
