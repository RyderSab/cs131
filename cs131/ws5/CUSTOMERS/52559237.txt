This problem is aggrevated in those who plcae personal revelation above received, canonical Scripture.  Outside a broader context and community to judge it, new prophecies can quickly become lethal reflections of a disturbed mind.  Mr. Krakauer does an excellent job in this book of educating the public on basic Mormon history and using this knowledge to highlight dangerous patterns in Mormon thought, especially among the fundamentalist sects.

You will have to read all the way through to the end to see how it all comes together and what impact his experience with fundamentlists had on the author.

The funniest aspect of this was the author's prediction (in the 80's) that his spiritual journey was part of a general movement of evangelicals back into mainline churches.  Well, that sure never happened.<br /><br />Reading the book, I couldn't help wondering what those evangelicals who then joined the Episcopal Church USA now think about their church with its non-celibate homosexual bishop and the various deviations from the historic Christian faith.  It also left me curious about how many of these people have become part of the current trend towards joining the Orthodox or Roman Catholic Churches.<br /><br />While I'm glad I finally read this book, I'm also glad I didn't spend too much on it at the used book store.	2005-05-04

They speak seamlessly with one voice, though, and do not distinguish which is writing at any particular time.<br /><br />The arguments against the traditional Christian view of heaven and hell and in favor of universalism are rooted not in Scripture, but rather experience.  Many passages are quoted, but generally out of context.  The writers explain that it really doesn't matter to them what the Bible says on these or other issues anyway, as experience is their ultimate authority.<br /><br />This subjective placing of experience as the ultimate religious authority is what really caused their faith in the Trinity, Incarnation and sacrificial Atonement to unravel, and not Universalism.<br /><br />For a better study of the subject from a biblical perspective, see \\"The Inescapable Love of God\\" by Thomas Talbott.	2005-05-03

Ms. Cather's work rather resembles a VCR in that she lets us see portions of the unfolding story before \\"fast forwarding\\" through resolutions and on into the rest of the story.  At times this is a bit of a \\"let down,\\" especially when the reader had been building interest only to have the following events passed over superficially.  On the whole, however, this book is masterfully written.<br /><br />The missionary priests seem so similar to the circuit-riding Methodist saddlebag preachers I've read about.  The main difference is, of course, the nature of their religion.  The privations and sacrifices associated with spreading their faith and fortifying it in the vast North American wilderness of the 1800s are the same regardless of specific beliefs.<br /><br />Anyone giving this book a fair reading will become very familiar with the two French priests and will finish the book having gained an appreciation for the history of the Southwest and for the faith of those first immigrants that settled it.	2005-03-26

The back cover gives away a lot, revealing the writer's ultimate participation in snake-handling, but the journey Mr. Covington made to that point is so well described and elaborated that you really won't mind knowing something about the end.  And really, that's not the end.  There is a bit of a \\"surprise ending\\" that left me reminding myself that this wasn't fiction, and also wondering whether the writer had somehow engineered or planned to do what he did in the end.<br /><br />Reading this book, you will find that \\"this thing\\" (as snake handlers describe their church and faith) isn't really primarily about snakes and poison.  Rather, it is about faith and knowing one's roots....and then it's about snakes and poison.  Much in the sub-culture of these Southern Appalachian snake-handling Pentecostals reminded me of the movie \\"The Apostle.\\"  Sin and salvation, faith and infidelity, strict fundamentalism in faith with liberality of practice -- all these elements mix in the living religion of the snake-handlers.<br /><br />The one major slow point in the narration comes in the last 1/3 of the book, where the writer spends  a few pages telling about his childhood hunts for snakes and then describing each variety in detail.  This portion I just skimmed over.<br /><br />Never did I imagine that I would find reading about these people and their beliefs to be a worthy pass time.  A lot depends on the one telling the story, and Mr. Covington did a masterful job of telling the snake-handlers' tale.	2005-03-21

Samuel Clemens, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and other famous writers can be identified by their writing alone, without reference to the title or author on the cover.  The major difference between a good writer and an excellent writer is, in my opinion, the ability to write a number of very good books without copying themes, plotline and style too much between them.  At least not allowing such copying to be done in a manner that is distracting to the reader.<br /><br />\\"Neverwhere\\" is a good read, but it is very similar to the later \\"American Gods\\" in the behavior of characters and the theme of a world existing parallel to our own, right before our eyes.<br /><br />A practical drawback for North Americans and others who have never been to London is the heavy reliance in this book on place names and terms that are familiar mostly to British people, and to Londoners in particular.<br /><br />Between this book and \\"American Gods,\\" I would recommend the latter as the best first book to read by this author, especially if it might be the only book by him that you read.  I do plan, however, to read Mr. Gaiman's other works.  So perhaps my perspective will improve.	2005-03-18

Though I'm not Mormon, I've read the Book of Mormon quite a bit.  Reading this book I was startled by parallels to the Book of Mormon narrative in 1st Nephi.  By chapter 10 the copying from that 19th century religious work was so overt I couldn't wait to finish it to write this review.<br /><br />Oh my gosh!  IT IS EXACTLY LIKE LEHI and family leaving Jerusalem.  They head out to live in tents.  The two older brothers are skeptical, critical and antagonistic.  The father names a river and a valley after those two, and the son Nafai (looks like \\"Nephi\\" to me!) receives a great number of visions from the \\"Oversoul.\\"<br /><br />What stopped me cold was when, as I expected, the father sent the sons back to town to get historical documents of the family.  This is JUST LIKE the Book of Mormon account.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can say whether the story itself is good or not, as I find the fundamental plotline being identical to the Book of Mormon to be terribly destracting.  Someone who's never read the Book of Mormon and (especially) has no opinion about it would surely write a fairer review.<br /><br />It is disappointing to see such a lack of originality in an author.  Tracy Hickman admits to involving elements of his Mormon faith in the original Dragonance series, but in that context it was minimal, made sense and did not constitute a wholesale copying of another work.	2005-03-15

In this sense it is \\"stand alone.\\"  However, it helps to have read his other books to have a feel for this universe.<br /><br />This book was difficult for me to get into.  Part of the problem is that the fascinating world involved is so far different from our own.  Time has to be spent reading and reviewing the charts provided from time to time to figure out how things are happening.  Another reason for difficulty of getting involved in the story is that too much information is withheld, leaving the reader wondering for too long about what certain things mean.<br /><br />A final drawback is weak character development.  The Smoke Ring itself takes center stage, so much so that the characters are mere shadows in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />This is, however, wonderful science fiction.  The fictional world created is truly remarkable and worth exploring.	2005-03-13

His section on his personal move to universalism and also the one defending universalism philosophically are both very interesting, though not terribly successful in forming  a strong argument.  What is really fascinating is the middle section which defended universalism on biblical grounds.<br /><br />Two of the primary passages Mr. Talbott utilized in his biblical argument for universalism (he uses many passages) are from Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15.  Until I read both in context I considered his position very reasonable.  Indeed, I do believe that Mr. Talbott succeeds in disproving classic Augustinian and Arminian views regarding these passages.  However, there are more views than the three he presents in his book.<br /><br />Reading Romans 5 it appears that the \\"death\\" being spoken of as coming into the world through Adam was physical death.  Thus, even those who had not sinned like Adam suffered death (Romans 5:12-14).  That this is the case becomes even clearer in 1 Corinthians 15, where the apostle Paul is proclaiming that Jesus really was risen from the grave and that all will be resurrected because of Christ.  1 Corinthians 15:21 discusses how death came into the world through one man, so resurrection of the dead can also come through one.  Unless the \\"resurrection of the dead\\" is speaking of a spiritual resurrection (as in Romans 6), the \\"death\\" the same passage refers to cannot be spiritual death.  The opposite of spiritual death would be spiritual resurrection.  The opposite of physical death would be physical resurrection.  Since Paul was very painstakingly making the case for the reality of Christ's physical resurrection, the latter contrast seems the correct one for this passage.  Thus, Christ's resurrection guarantees the general resurrection of all humanity, but not the spiritual salvation of all humanity.<br /><br />As much as I would like universalism to be true from a sentimental standpoint, it does not appear that I can believe in it and still affirm the authority of Scripture.  That being said, I gladly give this book 5 stars because it makes a remarkably coherent, intelligent, logical and compelling case for universalism.  If you will only have one book on the doctrine of Universal Reconciliation from a Christian perspective on your bookshelf, I really believe that this will be the one you want.from a sentimental standpoint, it does not appear that I can believe in it and still affirm the authority of Scripture.

Although the author presents shadow's perspective throughout the book, something about his personality remains pleasantly enigmatic.

Since she's now seven I don't read out of this Bible to her any more, but from age 3-6 it was great, and I'll read it to my little boy once he's old enough to sit still.  We read it cover to cover many times, and I'm convinced that this has helped to to establish a deep familiarity with the fundamental Biblical narrative.  Buy it and read it to your kids or grandkids.	2004-11-25

Do not use it merely as a hand-out to visitors, but incorporate it into the pre-Easter Bible studies of the congregation and present it to people investigating the faith in their homes.  Those already close to embracing the faith of Christ and His Apostles and Prophets will be brought in by this book.  Those further from faith in the Name could have this as a first step down their faith journey.  Buy it in boxes and use it.	2004-11-25

William Carey and others demonstrated a radical commitment to Christ and His Gospel by staking not only their lives, but also of their families, on it.  How this man accomplished so much despite problems at home and opposition from without is a wonder.  This text should be on the required reading list of everyone going into Christian ministry.	2004-11-25

These are the very brief biographies of Christian missionaries.  If you are looking for a deep study of one or all of those featured here, you should look elsewhere.

A good read, though with a definite lull following the war but preceding a rousing climax, it leans too heavily on the \\"institution of slavery\\" as a major cause of the war.  Despite what we have been taught in public school and by PBS, the North was definitely NOT abolitionist, and Lincoln himself was not aiming primarily for freeing the slaves.  The war was about economic issues and states rights, then to a much lesser degree about slavery.  In any event, if you enjoy science fiction and alternative history, you will likely not regret reading this novel.  If you are looking for historical accuracy up to the point of departure, then keep looking.	2004-11-24

Were this not the case, I might well never have bought, let alone read, this particular book.  It has in focus the &quot;bad guys&quot; of Salvatore's AD&amp;D storyline, but lacks a certain charm.  It is hard to wish the characters well and thus be drawn into their story, and when one of the secondary characters that had been relatively important is suddenly and swiftly dead, one can hardly mourn.  It is treated in the text pretty much as a next-to-irrelevant fact.<br />If you are a die-hard Salvatore fan, you'll want to read this book to keep up with the overall storyline and know what happens with the Crystal Shard.  If you're not a part of this &quot;elite&quot; band, then don't bother.	2004-07-17

Though the subject matter is somewhat technical at times, it is as understandable as any work of this genre probably can be.  Strobel does not explore beyond orthodoxy in his interviews, but then, that was not his purpose in writing this book.  It is a defense of the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith, and a successful one at that, in my opinion.	2004-05-26

Salvatore...until now.<br />Literally back from the Abyss, Wulfar tries to curl up at the bottom of a bottle of booze.  This is the story of a man's semiconscious struggle to regain or recreate his identity after going through every type of humiliation and torture that a demon can invent.<br />The torture scene at Luskan and the creative way Salvatore ties the two main threads of the story together at the end mark this book as one of his finest...even without the drow ranger.	2003-08-21

The characters were relatively believable, and the author did not get too sappy with the storyline.  Corin One-Hand was an especially good character, and his suffering and recovery from a deep personal crisis were great to see.<br />Now, that said, it behooves me to mention a point in this author's writing that I didn't find altogether agreeable.  Mr. Karpyshyn has an odd tendency to tell about an event happening from one character's perspective, and then retell the same even from another character's perspective.  He does this even with fight scenes and not particularly dramatic moments.  Further, the text of each retelling is so similar - at times word-for-word - that it leads one to suspect that he was trying to fill pages.<br />As a lover of fantasy novels who is fond of stories that conclude in the same volume, I heartily recommend this book to others despite the above-mentioned flaw.  If you appreciate fantasy, I doubt you'll regret buying &quot;Temple Hill&quot;.	2003-01-31

This book is exceptional only in its mediocrity.  Anyone who has read much fantasy and/or played fantasy role-playing games will find this book somewhat unhelpful.  The contents deal mostly with medieval customs and clothing, as well as modern witchcraft.  If, however, you know next to nothing about fantasy writing and would like to try writing it, this would be a reasonable book among others to buy...though I can't imagine why someone in such a situation would attempt to write fantasy in the first place.	2002-12-26

To be a great book, a real \\"page turner,\\" it perhaps would have been helpful to make it a little thicker and told in a storytelling style.  As a reader, I felt as though I was being barraged with a bewildering array of people and place names that I was expected to consider familiar.<br />This book might be interesting to someone interested in Mormonism and/or Las Vegas, but is probably best for a member of the LDS church who has a personal acquaintance with modern Las Vegas already.<br />One last thing, it is WAY overpriced.	2002-11-03

The problem for me was the extensive detail, especially to socio-political theory.  Most of the time I felt as though I was merely observing the author talking to himself, setting up one straw man after another and then knocking each one down.<br />If atheism bothers you and anarcho-capitalism isn't your cup of tea, then this book won't do much for you.  The science fiction aspect didn't really become interesting until the third section of the book, after already enduring seemingly endless political tirades.  It was, in a word, tedious.<br />Though I'm glad that I can say I've now read a book by this author, I do not intend to follow up with any of his other work.	2002-10-27

Particularly pleasing were the contributions by these gentlemen, showing great respect for the Word of God and not compromising on the truths this movement has advocated for years.  About half of the contributions from the independent Christian theologians were what I would consider edifying.  The others show the marks of a general shift away from solid Biblical standards and towards evangelical generalism.<br />Frankly, the responses provided by the evangelical theologians were sadly predictable.<br />All in all, this is a good book to purchase if you are a theology student looking to gain insight into current discussions and thought within the movement that some call \\"Stone-Campbell,\\" but which others of us prefer to refer to as the \\"Restoration Movement\\" or \\"this present Reformation.\\"	2002-10-17

The writer's contribution to rational evangelism in an increasingly postmodern context is much-needed and very helpful.  His \\"positive deconstruction\\" is a much better model, in my opinion, than the slick and formulaic evangelism methods often presented in other books.  My only regret is that his plan of salvation does not include the necessity of baptism (immersion).  Although he quotes from Acts 2:37-38, he glosses over the baptism portion, making it only a public confession of faith.  The rest was quite good, and I plan to reread it again soon and take notes!	2002-09-25

The area of Christian English teaching is in serious need of good theory and writing, and this book is an excellent first step in the right direction.<br />Mr. Snow writes for a broad audience, seeking to identify with liberals, moderates and evangelicals within the pale of Christendom.  On this score he does a magnificent job of presenting encouragement and useful ideas to drive along Christian mission within the context of English teaching.<br />One area in which I would have to disagree would be his insistence that teaching English to the poor in a given nation should not include any type of encouragement to move overseas in pursuit of a better life.  He argues that this defeats the purpose of teaching English to help improve a developing nation (though later he admits that this may not always be the case).  This may well be true in many nations.  However, in Brazil I have found that most Brazilians living overseas send money back to their families.  They help build businesses and put fellow family members through school.  Often, these Brazilians living overseas return to Brazil with savings to invest in opening their own businesses.  Their English skills are also frequently so polished after time in North America or Great Britain that doors are opened for them to become English teachers as well.  All this contributes to the development of a nation.<br />The final chapter of the book deals with building bridges with national churches.  Certainly, this chapter is more interesting to liberals and moderates than to evangelicals.  Though I considered it an interesting read, I have serious difficulty accepting that all that is called \\"Christianity\\" is authentic.<br />All in all, this is a great book, well worth the price and one that hopefully will be followed by others by different authors in this exciting field of missions.	2002-07-29

However, in order to spare others the expense of buying a book and then feeling sorry about it...here goes.<br />This book, evidently written from an evangelical viewpoint, attempts to communicate values and a Christian message while also telling a story.  Unfortunately, both the theological slant and the story itself suffer from some problems.<br />Beginning with the story, it has a simplistic storyline, a predictable plot and it is too sweet to be real.  The storyline was so transparent that I suspected several times that I was mistakenly reading a book written for young teenage girls.  I still have my doubts.  The action in the story was too neatly tied up, and the heaviest action was taken care of in a couple of chapters near the end of the book.<br />On the doctrinal side, one can say that there wasn't even a drop of water involved in the plan of salvation presented in this novel.  This is in stark contrast to the Book of Acts in the New Testament, where we find EVERY DECISION to obey Christ followed by water baptism.  In the rest of the New Testament, mentions of forgiveness of sins without baptism are addressed to Christians who were already baptized into Christ.  This isn't to say that it is the water that regenerates, but rather that water baptism is the point at which God has chosen to promise forgiveness of sins to those who truly repent and place faith in Christ.<br />The author clearly means well, but this book was hard to read all the way through and take seriously.  It could just be that I'm too critical, but I don't think so.<br />This book is recommended for girls ages 13-18, and pretty much no one else.	2002-07-29

Opening with compelling stories of private charitable work in the turn of the century northeast United States (mostly New York), the editor draws the reader in and keeps his or her interest all the way through the more intellectual and theoretical essays.

I would encourage readers as well to act on this information, and help out such private charities either through volunteerism or through financial donations, or both!	2002-07-03

Lingenfelter points out how we unconsciously follow different social orders at home, at work, at church and in various other situations.  He uses plenty of examples from mission experience in a number of cultures to apply this to church work.  As a missionary in Brazil, South America I found this book helpful in understanding and interpreting the culture in which I find myself.  HOWEVER, I do NOT recommend Lingenfelter's follow-up to this text, entitled &quot;Agents of Transformation.&quot;  This latter work is thickly technical and impractical, an example of how modern missiology is too often losing sight of reality.  Instead, I would heartily recommend &quot;Cross-Cultural Conflict&quot; by Duane Elmer as a good read after &quot;Transforming Culture.&quot;	2002-04-14
