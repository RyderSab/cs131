I usually like Tina's books, but I got so tired of the fact that nobody would believe anything Winslow had to say. She is convinced that her sister's fiance is a fraud and he threatens her constantly. He does all this behind her family's back so they don't believe her. Her sister thinks she is jealous. Her father is a millionaire business man who can't seem to think for himself. He thinks she is jealous and maybe on drugs.  <br /> <br />Finally she meets a Cuban American, Alex Diaz, who finally believes her. She is also positive Jayce was the one who ran down a fishing boat killing 2 Cuban Americans and disfiguring a little girl. Winslow was in a car accident and had to have her face rebuilt so she has great sympathy for the little girl. <br /> <br />The story was alright, but I got very tired of the Cuban connection. And as a matter of fact there was no cuban connection. By the time you get to the grist of the plot you are tired that no one in her family believes her then there are so many different ideas about what is going on, somehow they loose you in the machinations.	2005-10-07

You know who is the victim and who probably will be the killer.     The story is slow with very little fire. The romance is tepid, to say the least. Not much sexual tension at all. And some of the plot was just stupid. No one says I don't want it to 80 million dollars, without alittle thought. That part just made me mad because up until then I was trying to get into the book and believe the story. That just stopped it for me and made the rest of the book very pathetic.    I was very disappointed. Where was the suspense, where was the mystery, where were the sparks between our lovers?  No where!! This is a bland mishmash of unbelievable, trite, revelations. Do not waste your time or money.     When will Julie Garwood get back to writing the wonderful, funny, empathic, novels she used to write. Give us another THE BRIDE, THE WEDDING, PRINCE CHARMING, SAVING GRACE, RANSOM, HONORS SPLENDER OR FOR THE ROSES. Her recent foray into Romantic Thrillers or Suspense have been a great disappointment to me. I don't know about her other fans, but I hope she gives us a new historical soon.	2005-09-15

Instead I was tittilated, fasinated, and just stunned by this book. I really didn't know what to think at first. But by the 3rd or 4th chapter I was hooked.  <br /> <br />Tara is a non conformist, she is totally self absorbed, and not interested in any romantic efforts by her few friends. But along the way she gets cursed by a voo-doo priest and priestess. Then she gets involved with a man who is lost from Wall Street. To add to the mix she manages a bar for a friend and runs a business called Revenge Gifts on line. The story line has more twists and turns than a snake caught in a headlock.  <br /> <br />This is not really a romance nor is it a drama, what it is, is just an unbelievable fun read. A Wild, weird, farce with so much humor it knocks you for a loop. Read it with your tonque in your cheek and a mixed drink at your side.	2005-09-14

Several books have come out recently about genetics, and the manipulation of ova to increase intellegence, telepathy, telekenisis, and so forth.  <br /> <br />The plot was nataurally about a secret government agency trying to play God. Seems like they always get more than they want. Then they have to try to get rid of the evidence or control the experiment.  <br /> <br />The romance was hot, the plot was OK, but neither the characters nor the mystery was to my taste. I need alittle more than the standard outline. This seemed to me to be like so many of the recent books I have read.  <br /> <br />The fact they had to be in intimate contact to increase their powers and that some who had found each other had been unable to contain the force of their joining, and died in the attempt was alittle over the top.  <br /> <br />I like paranormal stories and I liked the telepathy angle. But I am tired of the X-files type of story. You might like it, I found it boring.	2005-08-16

The characters are wonderful, who cares if they are alien, their feelings and hopes and loves and pains are very human. Viehl writes worlds that I know are real, somewhere.  <br /> <br />There are not one or two main characters in this book, there are several, and all are wonderful. You could change the location to earth and make them all human and it would still be one of the best books I have read in a while.  <br /> <br />I buy because of the author or the synopsis on the back, but I only buy what I think I will like.

I didn't hate it but it is definitely not one of the better anthologys. The premise of dreams should tell you most of these are somewhat surreal. Now fantasy I love, but all three tales are alittle over the top. <br /> <br />Sherrily Kenyon's reminded me somewhat of Fantasy Lover until I think she lost her way and had to improvise the end. I was disappointed, most of her stories are stand alone good. <br /> <br />Rebecca York's tale of lovers parted by evil was better and I liked the physic connection.  <br /> <br />Robin Owens tale was good too. Not great as we expect from her but interesting. I just found the fact that they remembered their previous death and visit to (?) heaven, was alittle to easy for them.  <br /> <br />This book is not worth what it costs. Wait until you can borrow it or buy a used copy. This is just my opinion. <br /> <br />	2005-07-16

She returns to her home island to investigate a 15 year old murder. She is hoping to revive a dying career. Her mother is a psychic and she wants to televise her mother trying to contact the spirits in the murder house. <br /> <br />Joe Franconi is the Police Chief of the Island. HE is a burnt out cop who got wounded when a bust went bad. He does not expect a murder to happen on his little island. He and Nicky seem to get together very quickly. <br /> <br />This sounds like a good plot, but beware, Nicky is a media vulture, out for the fame. And Joe is just burnt out. I wait a year for each new Karen Robards book and I was disappointed. The first 350 pages try to get you to empathize with the main characters, the last 65 you get all the action and explaination and let say it was not worth it.  <br /> <br />With everyone seeing ghosts and old or possibly new murderers doing their best to kill Nicky, she is struggling for her 15 minutes of fame to catch the notice of a Morning News Show looking for a co-host. Joe is trying to live with a ghost he keeps seeing from his last bust. There was a great potential here for a great book. But the ending is so simple and straight forward ( even with two murderers ) that you just feel let down. <br /> <br />I could have had better feelings for the book if our two main characters had a little more character or integrity. The fact that they both got their best outcome was beside the point. I have been able to find something in everyone of Karen's previous characters. But Nicky was a total selfish fish.  This one did not do it for me. Like I always say different strokes for different folks, so you may like it. But these are my thoughts and I hate to pay so much for a book and be let down. How about you?	2005-05-20

I adored the above titles but this is a different type of novel. I am not saying it is not good just not as good as those others. This is more of a gothic type romance. <br /> <br />Rose Early has come to England to find her sister Joan who has gone missing. Both are photographers, Joan is compiling a book about the churches in England. Rose arrives in Marleton Village to find that her sister has not been seen in several days.  <br /> <br />Vic Drummond is a writer, he lives in Marleton and has had a few interludes with Joan. But after he meets Rose he realizes she is not like her sister. Eventually he falls in love with Rose as they hunt for her sybling.  <br /> <br />There seems to be a great deal more going on in the church than prayers. The ghosts of monks appear to Rose and she begins to see evil in and around the vicar, curate, and several members of the parish. Something evil is in the church and has set its thoughts on Vic. Togather they must fight against the evil not only in the church but in themselves. <br /> <br />This was an OK read, Vic and Rose seemed to fall into bed alot and the pace was alittle slow. However, the last few chapters went faster and finally explained what was going on.

It was so nice to finally meet a heroine who had a few morals. <br /> <br />The murder mystery is OK but you pretty well know who it is right away. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 star rating. The story is really more about the relationship between Casey and Mark and their families.  I loved it. My daughter loved it. and you will enjoy it too.

I got very tired of the split and fractured personalities of almost everyone in this book. Saying that, let me go on. <br /> <br />Arden Davis was a profiler for the FBI. She took part in an experiment to help her understand the serial killer's minds better. Many people dropped out but she persevered until she went home for Christmas and supposedly one of the serial killers she was learning about killed her family. It was his signature MO. When he was being executed he revealed that he DID NOT kill her family, he tells Nathan Fury in a note that he killed the rest but not them. <br /> <br />Nathan Fury is an FBI agent who started the program run by a brillant scientist, but he dropped out when he started thinking about killing as the ultimate high. He figures maybe Arden killed them while in some kind of trance taken over by the evil mind that has been fed into her brain. He finds her tending bar in Arizona and although they have had an affair she doesn't remember him at all. She had let the agency give her a brainwipe to remove her memories, unfortunately it hadn't quite worked, she still had vague memories and dreams, she couldn't trust herself that anything she remembered was real.  <br /> <br />When Fury reveals what French(the serial killer) told him, he convinces her to come back to the lab so they can determine what happened. This woman is so physcotic you don't know what is going on. She is promiscuious, paranoid and so wrapped up in her own mind she can't function very well.  <br /> <br />Even though the experiment was supposedly stopped, there are several more people at the saniterium. This was the biggest mess I have read in a long time. I did not like any of the characters and by the end I just wanted all of them dead, so I could stop reading. I just have to finish any book I start and this one was way over the top. Even at the end we have no idea how much of these killers she absorbed. Any one who would let a scientist mess with their brain like this deserves what he gets. Don't waste your TIME or money.	2005-05-04

He was invited by Logan who is trying to get him interested in a business deal. Michael knew Leigh when she was a struggling student in college. He had been a clerk in his aunt's market. At the time he was going to college, after a term in prison for manslaughter. One night he had saved Leigh's life when she was mugged after leaving the store. You would think she would recognize him, however, he had been poor, with a beard, and didn't talk to her much then. But he has never  forgotten the girl with the green eyes who always bought pears. <br /> <br />The police have been after him for years. They have tried time and again to convict him of something, almost as if they have a vendetta against him.

As the facts about her unfaithful, decietful, and lying husband are revealed, she feels she can't trust her own instincts except with Michael. When Logan's body is found she is pushed even closer to Michael and the cops arevery ready to believe she and Michael killed him.  <br /> <br />I had read a couple of Judith's historicals and was not impressed. But this is a superb work, I hope she writes many more contemporary novels. I will surely try to find her other contemporary books I have missed.	2005-04-09

The only thing I didn't like was his fixation with bonding with a vampire female. If bonding is the greatest thing that can happen to a Prime, as long as she is his match and mate, I found him to be stuck on himself. Obviously his opinion of mortals is abit biased. The fact that he could go with a different female every night after leaving Mia, just made him a hound in my opinion. I think one of the other reviewers said he acted like he was 12 years old, and I agree strongly. I kept wishing Mia would tell him to go soak his head.  <br /> <br />Mia is a mortal whose family have been vampire hunters for many generations. However, she doesn't believe in vamps and knows nothing about fighting them. After finding out Colin in a vamp she contacts her great-grandfather to find out more about them and how to fight them. Wouldn't you know her grandpa is the Patron, the very man the Clans are hunting. The manticore tribe is after him as well. It was very interesting to find out all the diffenences between the Clan, Tribes, and Purists.  <br /> <br />When Colin and Mia are forced to bond because she bit him, (it's OK if he bites her during mating, but she wasn't supposed to bite him). I say more power to her. So against his will, (he still thinks he may be able to get rid of her and bond with a real Vampire Chick) they are bonded by the matri of his clan. Then the tribe contacts the clan to demand Mia because her grandpa stole their money.  <br /> <br />Mia agrees to help them get their money if they will not kill her grandpa. So Colin, Mia and Laurent fly to grandpa's. Laurent pretending to be a captured vamp. Needless to say Laurent's Tribe can't be trusted, and the ensueing mess finally comes to a conclusion. Only after Mia is almost killed while being tortured by the leader of Laurent's tribe does Colin admit he loves her. I just wanted to smack him up side the head all through the book.  <br /> <br />This was a short book. The type is very large to get in the number of pages needed. However, with someone as slow on the uptake, and determined to gain power when he bonded, I was just as ready to see the end of the book. I still feel someone should have knocked some sense into Colin.  <br /> <br />I look forward to her next book, from the short start at the end of this book. I think Laurent is a very interesting new character.	2005-04-02

Now 25 years later a 2 year old's skeleton is found in a wall in a suitcase. Olivia's family have a distinctive genetic defect, which Olivia and the dead child share, they were born with 2 thumbs on one hand. The extra thumb was removed at birth. So who is this child? The same age as Olivia and with the same distinctive mark on her hand it sets the stage for mystery and murder. <br /> <br />Trey Bonney is a detective with the Dallas PD. He was also Olivia's first love. Their love was broken up by her grandfather who is very rich. Trey was from the wrong side of the tracks. Althought 11 years have past, he and Olivia have never forgotten each other. <br /> <br />The man who picked up the ransom has just been released from prison. The money was never found. Now after 25 years in jail he finds the money he hid was burned up in a fire. Although he did not kidnap Olivia or murder her parents, he knows who was involved. With the police hunting him now for answers to the murder, what will he do? Will he run or finally tell them what he knows. <br /> <br />As if this is not enough, we have an abortion clinic bomber who is insane because when the bomb went off, a church bus had broken down in front of the clinic and several children were killed. Now he thinks God has given him a chance to redeem himself by killing Olivia.  <br /> <br />The thing I love about Dinah McCall/Sharon Sala is that her books may be very dark but at the end you find compassion and understanding for all. The ending of this book made me sad and unfulfilled, because of the infidelity, greed, hatred, and manipulation which led to the crimes. I found the lead characters to be 2-dimensional, very easily swayed, and at the end I just didn't feel that the story came together in a smooth way to bring closure. It was a very deep dark mess. I really don't know why I felt that way I just did. This isonly my review and I can only tell you what I think and felt. But in my opinion it is not as good as the rest of her books.	2005-04-02

Then taken to Rene's and dumped on him until she agrees to do a documentary on the bayou. Not only is she hot about the kidnapping, she is raging at Rene, who was her biggest opponent in school. NOt to mention what happened the night she got snockered with him at age 15. She had hoped to never see the creep again.  <br /> <br />Tante Lulu just looks at them and declares that they had been hit by a lightening bolt. As unhappy as she is to see who St. Jude has choosen for REne, she sets out to do her best to see it accomplished. At 80 years old and smitten by Richard Simmons nothing can hold this wildcat back. While they fuss, fight, and fall she is \\"sweating to the oldies\\", filling his hope chest, and helping them against the oil tyrants who are trying to stop the filming of the bayou. <br /> <br />While the book has alot of humor and hot romance like all of Sandra Hill's books. The plot is not quite as good as TALL DARK AND CAJUN, THE LOVE POTION, or her Viking series. It is still a great way to spend some time. And if you like me, enjoy alittle (or alot) of humor, you won't be able to put it down.	2005-03-26

The only thing I don't particularly like is that they all have sequels, either 3,4,5, or 6 to complete the story. However, some are so good you are more than willing to wait. They also end at a good point. This one started out good, but as the story moves slowly and surely to a point where it can be left for a sequel you are quite tired, and I was disappointed. The family structure of 6 to 12 people per marriage just didn't do a thing for me. I'm afraid I am old fashioned enough to want a one on one marriage or love affair. <br /> <br />Kallista Varyl is a natian with north magic. She can throw lightening. When her country is invaded and they are overrun she seeks help from the One. She is filled with great power. Then she finds she has to connect with several other people who are filled by the One.

He has guarded her for 9 years. He has been in love with her for quite a while. It is against their laws for he and she to become close. I just thought that with all the great possibilities it was kind of a let down the way things worked out. It may be different for male readers but I think female readers will be alittle put off.

I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. But it is a good book and not once did our heroine think she was asleep and dreaming. ( I simply can't stand for the character to go through that one more time. It has been done to death.) <br /> <br />Tessa Camen is a martial arts expert who guards the President. She has trained for many years and is undefeated. While guarding the pres they are attacked and she throws her body in front of the pres. Knowing she will die.

His world will receive full membership in the Federation if she can win, and Earth will receive a sub membership which will allow it to buy technology to clean up the pollution strangling it. <br /> <br />The first few chapters were a little slow.

I look forward to more of these adventures in this new world created by Susan Kearney.	2005-03-06

She could have been killed. So the producer of the soap puts her character in a coma so she can be protected (IF) someone is trying to kill her. It seems she plays an advice giving ballbuster on the show.  (Her character reminded me alot of Susan Lucci's) When a television advice giver is murdered, her husband is arrested. Then somewhere in Ohio another radio advice giver drowns in her tub. Is this a coincidence? On the basis  of these two deaths she is encouraged by her manager, agent and producer to take a vacation and do a music video for a group called \\"Kill Me Quick\\". The vacation is endorsed by the sponser of the soap,( maybe because she would not jump into bed with him). Anyway she has to dance a tango in the video. <br /> <br />Doug O'Casey is a dance teacher/private investigator who used to be a cop. WOW. He is hired to teach her to dance and also to be a kind of bodyguard. When he is not dancing in competitions he works with his brother who is married to a dancer who owns a dance studio. His brother is a PI. <br /> <br />With all this background which makes me a little nausous. The book gets somewhat better, and the romance and romantic scenes are some of her better work. I was really getting into it and thinking she was going to pull it off. But the resolution was the pits. Totally unsatisfying. It seemed to be something out of a soap opera. I wonder if she wrote herself into a hole and needed a quick fix to get out. This is not the worst book I have read, but I encourage you to get it from the library or wait for the paperback.	2005-02-25

He went into a deep depression when he was shot and his partner was killed. He has accepted a job as police chief of Lunacy, Alaska.    Maggie GAlloway is a bush pilot in Lunacy. Raised by her mom, the town [...], who owns the Lodge, she is very independent. I found her unlikeable at first. Even later in the book I had very little connection with her character.    The beginning of the story is slow. It reminds me alot of the TV series Northern Exposure. There are some weird and wacky characters.     Finally the real story begins when Maggie's  father is found murdered in an ice cave on the mountain. Everyone thought he had left her mother and her 16 years earlier. Trying to keep you in the dark about who was climbing with her father and murdered him doesn't seem to work very well. I will say that it was the one I thought, and wanted it to be. The book seemed alittle long to me and I just did not like most of the characters. They were not people I could identify with. So it was hard to feel compassionate. She has written much better books.	2005-01-06

Not just because of the gay relationship but because I really do enjoy the SEAL stories better. Cosmo has been a great character and I really wanted to read his story.  I also like Jules and I feel he has had a positive influence on my perception of gay people. <br /> <br />Cosmo Richter is a member of SEAL team 16. While on leave to take care of his mother who has broken both wrists, he works for Trouble Shooters Inc. to make extra money. <br /> <br />Jane Chadwick is a movie producer in Hollywood who is threatened by a hate group because she is working on a movie about a gay American Hero from WWII. She is very dedicated to the gay rights movement.  <br /> <br />Jules Cassiday is called in by the FBI. He is the wonderful character from previous books. Although he is gay he is a strong honest person. He does his job and doesn't quit. He too is human, and simply looking for that one special person to complete his life. <br /> <br />Robin Chadwick the brother of Jane is the star of the movie. Somehow he gets his sexuality mixed up with the character he is playing. He fights for his identity the whole book and I don't think he ever really finds it. <br /> <br />Whether you agree with the perceptions of the author or not, this is an intriging read. The story is fast paced with alot more romance than her last novel. I still find T/S lacking somewhat in scope since they do a more one on one type of action. The Sophia and Decker romance has more or less fizzled, but you feel there will be more in future books, AKA, Sam and Alyssa.  <br /> <br />There is also a short story for our continueing Sam and Alyssa addiction. As a matter of fact most of our former lead characters make a small cameo appearance.	2004-12-31

A former cheerleader, Prom queen, politician's wife, now divorced she has her own business, Great Bods, a fitness salon.

Anyway, she witnesses a murder in her parking lot. Then it seems the killer is trying to kill her, either because she is a witness, or she was the one he was trying to kill to begin with. <br /> <br />Jefferson Wyatt Bloodworth is the Lt. assigned to her case. He is also the man who after 3 dates dropped her without an explanation. No way is she letting him drop back into her life after 2 years without paying for the hurt he caused her. Wyatt is determined to get their relationship back on track. Getting her to stay with him at his house while they hunt the killer is a break for him, but he finds nothing is easy with Blair. <br /> <br />These two strong willed people fight the battle of the sexes. I have to say the interaction is humerous, entertaining and wonderful. The mystery is also pretty good. My only complaint is I wish I had known what Wyatt was thinking in some of these situations. Sometimes you just have to take a chance. <br /> <br />	2004-12-30

(Yeah, Right) This is the witch who cursed his family because his father would not father her child. Then Shanara's father murdered his father while he was a wolf and wears his skin as a token.<br /><br />3)I have to say this next one was pretty dumb. Or maybe I just didn't like it.  Tara is a medicine woman's daughter and she has been bitten by a vampire. She is trying to hold on until she can find her grandmother who can save her. Rider is a biker who saves her at a bus stop. Naturally they fall in love. So he rushes to take her to her grandmother, but when they get there her grandmother has moved to Arizona.

(Poor Tara, yeah, right)<br /><br />4)A Navajo Skinwalker is after Maya Alexander, her only hope is Clay Phillips, a member of an x-files type force.

Again she takes a well used plot, a stalker, a serial killer, an innocent ADA, a good cop, and lots of suspense to give you one of the best and most refreshing books I have read in some time.  <br /> <br />While some of my favorite authors have let me down, Rose has once again rose to the top of the heap. <br /> <br />Kristin Mayhew has faced down her own devils to face those of the victims who have been raped and killed  not only by their attacker, but by the justice system itself. <br /> <br />Abe Reagan has faced his own trials and has finally come out from undercover work after 5 years. Each of these characters has faced grim life and found a way to survive. <br /> <br />Mia Mitchell has lost a dear friend and mentor. Now she has to take on a new partner. <br /> <br />A vigilantee serial killer has left three boxes in Kristin's trunk. The clothes, with photographs of the murdered men, and letters to Kristin are enclosed. Someone is taking out the evil men who have evaded justice and destroyed the lives of innocents. <br /> <br />This is just the beginning, from his letters it is obvious he has been closely watching Kristin.  <br /> <br />As more and more bodies turn up, Kristin and Abe find that each has what it takes to heal the other. Not to just survive, but to be truly healed, clearly that takes a miracle or a serial killer. <br /> <br />This is one of those books you can't put down. I esspecially like the sense of immediacy in her books. Sometimes I could not help but feel what the killer was feeling, and ask myself if I could have been overcome by the same feelings he faced. <br /> <br />A truly intriging and fasinating tale.

US	45775115	RUT03QJU9ULB1	0345453824	572584022	Murder List	Books	3	20	27	N	N	Disappointing	I love Julie Garwood's historical novels. I also enjoyed HEARTBREAKER and MERCY was OK. MURDER LIST was somewhat disappointing. <br /> <br />Regan, our heroine, Sophie, and Cordie met in kindergarten and have been friends ever since. Regan is not only nieve she is not a girl of the 21st century. No one could be as gullible as her and run a million dollar charity. <br /> <br />Sophie is an obnoxious, nosy, impulsive troublemaker.  Cordie is the most likable one and she and Regan seem to be led about by Sophie. Cordie seems to be the most down to earth, she likes to work on cars and I really liked her, most of the time. <br /> <br />Alec Buchanan is a cop, he is the brother of Theo from MERCY, and Nick from HEARTBREAKER. Like most of Garwood's heros he is tall dark and handsome. He interacts with others well and has a great sense of humor. <br /> <br />Sophie convinces Regan and Cordie to go to a seminar by Dr. Lawrence Shields, who she thinks is a scam artist. They go and during an enlightenment exercise all are asked to make a list of people they would like to do without. A murder list if you will. Regan has to leave to take a phone call and doesn't have time to turn in her list so it can be burned in the fire with the rest. <br /> <br />When Regan leaves to get her car she is almost attacked in the parking lot. She falls and drops her phone and her folder with the list in it. <br /> <br />Now it gets started. She receives a photo of one of the people on her list, hanging dead in his basement. So her brothers demand police protection for her. The commander is mad at Alec so he gets the nod. Since he is leaving for the FBI in 3 weeks, it seems like a good job for him. <br /> <br />Regan has 3 brothers, and we are to understand they are over protective, They just seemed annoying to me. She can't seem to stand up for her self.  <br /> <br />While Alec guards her, others look for her attacker, admirer, or stalker, whichever. Sophie and Cordie go to the Cayman Islands following Dr. Shields. Alec and Regan start to fall in love, so her three brothers do nothing. After controling her life forever, they just sit back and let her marry a cop. (I don't think so) <br /> <br />IF this seems to confuse you, don't worry it has nothing to do with the story. <br /> <br />Soon another name from her list dies. Thankfully it was a natural death but the stalker/killer lets her know he was on the job but she was already dead.  <br /> <br />Now they try to find anyone who would want to harm Regan. The reason this doesn't work is because in this book as in HEARTBREAKER, she is only the instrument he wants to use to punish someone else.  <br /> <br />I won't go into more detail but I found that I could stop reading, have a nice long conversation with my daughter, and then go back with out the first feeling of frustration. I read it but it really didn't hold most of my attention.  <br /> <br />My advice is get it from the library. <br /> <br />Or Read AS GOOD AS DEAD by Beverly Barton. If anyone had interrupted me while I was reading this book, I probably would have gone ballistic. It was that good. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-08

It is the best although the other two (THE FIFTH VICTIM & THE LAST TO DIE) are excellent this one is superb. <br /> <br />Reve is the twin sister of Jazzy. They take DNA tests and then confront Jazzy's Aunt Sally. Reve was found in a dumpster and adopted by the Sorrell's. It turns out Jazzy was abandoned in a stump in the woods. Sally found her and raised her. <br /> <br />From here to much information ruins the book. I will say the romances are wonderful and let us know you are never to old to find love. <br /> <br />Not only does Jacob and Dallas, the sheriff and chief of police, have to try to protect the twins from whoever tried to kill them 30 years ago. There is a serial killer killing redheads, Reve and Jazzy are both redheads. <br /> <br />The story is wonderful full of twists and turns. I could not put it down.

To tell you the truth each one needed abit more to make it enjoyable. <br /> <br />First we have a psychic who has shut down her powers when she was a child, The descriptions at the begining sound like a seer psychic, later on they tell us she is a medium. But in the book she only sees one ghost and he isn't very scary. <br /> <br />We have dead bodies appearing in the forest. We have a laird who comes home unexpectedly and finds his castle has been rented by a group of friends who put on a performance of history art for tourists.  <br /> <br />The ghost appears and leads our heroine, toni, around the castle at night but no one believes her. <br /> <br />Toni and the laird seem to jump in bed at the drop of a hat. He doesn't believe her even though he has had an unexplained experience himself, when he was a cop hunting a killer. Some things are never explained. If this is romance, spare me. <br /> <br />The killer is obvious and with everything else going on there is very little revealed about him until the last few pages. There is very little revealed about his motivations and with only 3 bodies found over 1 and 1/2 years, somewhat slow. The search for the latest victim is not very well done. Maybe because this is Scotland? <br /> <br />If you start this book, you will probably be like me and finish it, but it left alot to be explained and by the end you are so tired of the mess you just want to finish.	2004-09-02

It is very unusual for the guy to be the one trying to get his lover back.  <br /> <br />Liz had married Jake ten years before. They had only been married a short time, when she caught him in bed with another woman. Something any woman would find hard to forgive. They divorced without his knowing she was pregnant. She married 2 years later and her husband adopted Fiona. <br /> <br />Liz and Jake both worked for the FBI. Eight years later A serial killer called the Cemetary Man killed Fiona to get to Liz. Jake had been the lead detective and he was the one who found Fiona and had to tell Liz her daughter was dead. HE didn't know it was his daughter too. However, after finding Fiona he couldn't forget her and had put all his efforts into finding the killer.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the killer was only interested in challaging Liz and until he found her again, which took him 2 years, he didn't kill again. Jake's profile of the killer told him that the killer was on the search for Liz.  <br /> <br />Liz disappeared after the killing, her husband lost his mind and wound up in a sanaterium. Still hiding from life, Liz is divorced and alone. But the Cemetary Man has found her. Just as Jake has found her. By this time Jake is suffering from burnout. his determination to catch this killer, to protect Liz has caused His superior and psychiatrist to force him to take time off.   <br /> <br />Having found her Jake knows the killer is close and the killings start again. Jake loves Liz but he feels she hates him and has every right to.  <br /> <br />The story of two lost people who need each other, is well written and the different slant on the romance adds to the suspense as the killer stalks Liz. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book and the clash of personalities who have matured over the years. The suspense was well done and the secondary characters were very well defined.	2004-09-01

If any could be said to be slow this is the one. However, if you like werewolf stories you can't beat it. <br /> <br />The Night Owl by Emma Holly was awesome. I really enjoyed it and it gives you a taste of her novels about the upyr. It really made me want to buy some of her other books. <br /> <br />Seduction's Gift by Angela Knight was so good I think it will set the scene for a whole new series similar to Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunters. I liked the premise and enjoyed the story. <br /> <br />This was a very entertaining read for the afternoon. I don't think you could possibly be disappointed.	2004-09-01

Now in this place he faces the fact that this killer is totally centered on him. With each murder Luke faces his inability to out think this killer. <br /> <br />Obviously Luke has done a profile on the killer but the murderer seems to have a profile on Luke. <br /> <br />As with her other novels there are suprises and unexpected developements on every other page.

My husband died recently and I have been reading alot about reincarnation. This book appealed to me because I have often wondered about family and friends coming back to live another life. <br /> <br />I have been a christian most of my life, I was saved at the age of 12. I never really wondered until after my children were born. Although most Christians make fun of reincarnation I have found that it has increased my faith in God and Jesus and helped me to better understand His word. <br /> <br />My Uncle had been like a father to me, he and my aunt were always there for me.  My father never worked a day if he could help it. My mother was chronically depressed.  We lived with this Aunt and Uncle most of my childhood. <br /> <br />In 1973 my uncle died at 53 of heart failure. I had 2 children by then and did not want any more. Surprisingly, even though I was on the pill, I got pregnant at the end of 1975. In April of 1976 I gave birth to a little girl.  <br /> <br />This child has been there for me at every trouble I have had, esspecially the death of my husband. She has been my rock and my staunch ally throughout all of her life. If I have a need she is there. My other children are very like her, in that I only have to ask and they are there for me. All are very supportive. But she seems to find my needs before I do. <br /> <br />But when she was small, only 2 years old, she would cry every time I mentioned my Uncle's name, and when we went to the cemetary she became very upset. I wish I had read this book at that time. I would have asked her questions. <br /> <br />When I ask her now she remembers crying, she says she felt at that time that she knew him. Now she is 27 and says she doesn't feel like that now. <br /> <br />This book opens up alot of questions and I found it an amazing record that is very well written. If you are interested in this phenomona I highly recommend this book.	2004-08-27

I esspecially enjoyed the new cause of vampirism. <br />It is a virus, and only a few humans can be turned. Also the vampires don't need alot of blood, just a pint or so. They don't have to be evil or killers. <br /> <br />This book starts quickly and doesn't let up. The pace is fast and furious, with great love scenes and a good love story. <br /> <br />Cade McKinnon was a Texas Ranger who was turned a few years after the civil war. He has been the spawn of his sire, Ridgemont, until 5 years ago when he was able to cut the ties to his 800 year old master. <br /> <br />Valarie Chase has nightmares about the night 3 vampires killed her parents.  One of the vampires managed to hold off his master's will long enough for her to escape with her baby sister. <br />Valarie was 12 and after many sessions with her therapist was able to forget most of that night. <br /> <br />When Valarie reached 17 she started to have nightmares about the killings. At that time a person she calls Cowboy, entered her dreams and killed the bad people. As years go on they become lovers in her dreams. Now at 29 she has been hired to ghost-write Ridgemont's memoires. <br /> <br />Cade knows Ridgemont has plans for Valarie, he trys to warn her in a dream, when that doesn't work, he calls her home and warns her sister.

He doesn't realize that Ridgemont has planned this whole thing for all these years. <br /> <br />The tension and growing love between cade and Valarie must be strong enough to face the fate Ridgemont has decreed for them. <br /> <br />This was agood read and a new focus on vampires for us who are tired of the old Bela Lugosi type of vampires. <br />	2004-08-08

I hope there will be many more. <br /> <br />While the characters are good, the romance leaves alittle to be desired. Abrial is a wonderful character, he is the Unseelie Queen's Executioner. As Mabigon is dead, he is free of her. <br /> <br />Nyssa really doesn't know who she is. But she has some bad suspicions. She is hunting for her lost memories. This leads her into the past. IT also brings her to the attention of Abrial and Jack Frost. <br /> <br />Yes! All of our former friends are in this book. I loved catching up with all of them. <br /> <br />Jack sends Abrial to get Nyssa and bring her to Cadalach. They have to fight goblins (including Lilith), the government, HUG, and the hobgoblin (Qasim). The chase is on.  <br /> <br />Very fast paced, with a great plot. But I felt there was not enough emphasis on the romance. Yes the guy gets the girl, but it was way too easy for them to fall in love. <br /> <br />Abrial has had to live without many emotions to protect himself from the stress or memories of the many kills he made for the Dark queen (Mabigon). Nyssa had so many questions in her life she didn't let herself get involved with anyone. <br /> <br />There seemed to be a great deal of room for both to be more shaken by the emotions they feel for each other. Anyway I would have liked to have understood more.   <br /> <br />All in all, I never miss one of the Wildside Romances. Neither should you.I enjoyed the book and sat up late to finish it.	2004-08-06

I thought it would be too much fluff for me. NOT SO!  <br />  <br /> This is a great read, my first by Michele Albert, she takes some very serious things and not only makes you understand these people, but care about what they have had to face. There is laughter and tears in this one. <br />  <br /> Emma Frey is a strong, steady, reliable cop with integrity. She has moved back to New Orleans to try and remake her life after a bad experience with the seedy side of law enforcement. <br />  <br /> At first Bobby Halloran strikes us as, a lightweight ladykiller,a heavy drinker, and unreliable. Later we see his facade and realize he has reached that dangerous state known as &quot;Burnout&quot;. Not only is he a good cop, he has let himself care too much. <br />  <br /> The captain puts these two opposites together. From the first page to the last they strike sparks off each other. He calls her &quot;Earnest Emma&quot;. And she thinks he is a flake. <br />  <br /> The situations and chemistry between him and Emma are always unpredictable. There is excitement, laughter, and explosive drama on every page of this book. I loved how the story reveals each character to us. These are not perfect people, but they are real. I could not put it down and I am going to buy every one of her books I can find.	2004-08-06

She was 12 at the time and she knows he was with her babysitting, when the crime was committed. NO one would believe her then. So now with a changed name and before her last year of Law school, she is working in the DA's office where she has access to the records and starts her own investigation. <br /> <br />She believes one of the cops who answered the call to the house, did the crime.  She has noticed other crimes in other towns similar to her father's. The men were always convicted because the victim was strangled with something of theirs. A tie, a belt, or a kerchief. <br /> <br />Chief detective Michael Callas, is one and Finn Rasmussen, a security expert is the other. Ellie sets out to get to know both, but she falls in love with one of them. Is he the murderer or not. How she finds out and finally gets justice for her family is a great story. I liked these characters, you can understand why a man might love a woman, but not trust her when he finds out why she has pursued him. <br /> <br />The suspense is great, the plot is well written and the pacing is fast.  A good book.	2004-08-01

We first met him in HEAD OVER HEELS, then he helped his buddy Zach in LUCKY SEVEN. He is a former SEAL now a PI. <br /> <br />When Victoria Hamilton's father is murdered, her lawyer sends John to help her find her brother. Who has run away because he thinks he killed his father when he pushed him and he fell down. He doesn't know that his father was stabbed to death. <br /> <br />Surprise, John and Tori had a fling 6 years earlier. The deal was no last names or regrets. So he didn't know her last name and she didn't know his. <br /> <br />Surprise again, They have a 5 year old daughter Esme. It's downhill from there. Tori's father was a rich, cold, manipulative clod. He was mentally abusive. When he demanded she have an abortion, she left and has lived in England for the last six years. Only her father's murder could have brought her home. <br />She didn't want her child raised like she was.  <br /> <br />John's father wasn't rich but he was abusive, physically and mentally. John has always worried about becoming like his old man and works hard to control his temper. He is very insecure about his ability to maintain a relationship, and therefore, has not allowed himself to become emotionally involved with a woman. <br /> <br />Now he has no choice, not only has he never forgotten Tori, he has a daughter to think about, he is something he had never expected to be, a father. <br /> <br />During all this he has to try to catch a murderer and prove Tori's brother did not kill her father.  <br /> <br />This book is not quite as lighthearted and humerous as the first two.  But I loved it. John not only has to work out the mystery, but he has to learn who he is, after all these years of letting his father's opinion rule his life. He must discover that he is a worthwhile being, and that he is lovable, that someone can and does love him. He must learn to trust others as well as himself. <br /> <br />Tori has to learn to trust also. This is a book about lives touching lives and the damage that can carry over from childhood to adulthood. It also reveals the courage that can change all of that. Sometimes it just takes faith. <br /> <br />Since I read my first Susan Andersen book (EXPOSURE, still my favorite) She has always delivered a wonderful reading experience. This is no exception. <br /> <br />	2004-07-28

Some of our favorite characters from STARDOC are in this one. The native species of K-2 are aquatic. But to tell you the truth I couldn't tell the difference from humans in their attitudes and ways. <br /> <br />That is one of the things I love about her books, these are people just like us. The way she writes reminds me of some of my favorite Andre Norton books. <br /> <br />Dair is a young female who has been augmented and changed in body sculpture so she can fly space fighters.  In her case it was not a matter of choice, but one of life and death. Before she was born her mother's body and her's were severely damaged by the Core. A life form on this planet. Her mother died. <br /> <br />Onkar has lived as a rogue for most of his life. When he saves two young pups he is invited to join the Coastal Pod. He becomes second in command after Dair, of the pilot pod. You never forget that they are aquatic but you consider them friends and come to care very much for all the characters in this book. <br /> <br />NOt only are there dangers on their world, but even more dangers in the stars. This is such an intriging world and the politics and military plots are not subtle. <br /> <br />This is an adventure, I couldn't put it down. From complex relationships to the simple idea of death and renewal, we are caught in a story that touches your heart and mind. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good way to spend an afternoon.	2004-07-28

In DARK HORSE we had to use our imaginations alittle. But there were sparks between Estes and Landry. In this one, it didn't end right. <br />This is a great thriller/suspense adventure. But the romance, what little there is, leaves you unsettled. As I have said I like books that leave me with a cozy warm feeling.   This one does not. It feels as though Hoag writes without any trust in men. Her women characters seem to feel that there are few, if any, good men out there.<br />The plot and characters are crisp and well defined. I liked Parker and the secondary characters were very motivated. The only thing left out was a good romance. With a happy ending.<br />The ending is totally unexpected and left me with a vague sense of dissatisfaction.<br />However no one does suspense like Hoag and that remains so in this novel.	2004-07-16

If you are like me you can't wait for one of her books to come out. This one is GREAT.<br />Maddie Fitzgerald has had a hard life, but now things are looking up.  She is in New Orleans to make a presentation that could take her fledgling advertizing agency into the big time. That night in her hotel room someone tries to kill her. Not only that, but he does kill another Madaline Fitzgerald in the same hotel. Which one did he mean to kill?<br />Sam McCade has been on this killer's trail for a month, the killer likes to tease him with hints before the kill. When Sam learns another Madaline has been attacked, but managed to escape he thinks he has his first break.<br />Maddie doesn't know if the hit was to be on her or not.  But the FBI has already left her out to dry once, and she sure doesn't need them on her case again. IT has taken her 7 years to rebuild her life.<br />If it is the mob, she thinks she can hold some evidence over them and make them call off the hit. All the time she has Sam and his crew on her tail.  Which is lucky because they save her life again and move in to protect her. She is not willing to tell them anything about her knowledge of the mob. She must protect herself. <br />When the killer strikes again she knows she will never be safe. She begins to think someone else is after her. But who? The attraction between her and Sam is potent. Eventually they confess to falling in love.<br />But the killer is not just after Maddie, somehow he seems to be connected to Sam, too. <br />The excitement never lets up. This is a fast paced story and so good you don't want it to end. There is a touch of humor, and you will feel alot of compassion for Maddie. The secondary characters are great, the ending surprising and exciting. Don't start to read it late at night, you may not get any sleep.	2004-07-15

This one I will not be keeping.<br />Lily has been a contract killer for the CIA since she was 18. Lucas has been a field agent (killer owned by CIA) since he was 19. Not only are they killers but they believe they are doing it for their country! (HA! HA!) <br />Lily's friends and adopted daughter have been murdered by one of the worst criminals in the world. Salvatore Nervi is an arms dealer. He sells plutonium to terrorists. He is a major drug maker and dealer. He is wanted by many countries. A totally evil individual. So Lily sets out to take him out. She does.<br />BUT He is protected by the CIA because he has an agreement with them. He is sometimes an informant. Probably against his competitors. She knows that she will be considered a wildcard and possibly be sanctioned (murdered) by the CIA for taking him out.<br />Does this make sense? She kills for her country, and her country will kill her for killing a bad guy. <br />Lucas is sent to find her. He finds her and falls in love with her. She explains that Nervi had her friends and daughter killed because they blew up one of his labs. She is convinced that her friends had a good reason to blow up the bad dude's lab. So she convinces Lucas to help her. He only wants to get closer to her before he turns her in.<br />I am very unsympathetic to both of them. The first half of the book is trying to make you like these two people. The last third is the finding evidence against the Nervi organization, blowing it up, being betrayed by Lucas and finally being put in a sanitarium to help her get over being a murderer.  wow.<br />In CRY NO MORE we are able to see Diaz for what he is, but we recognize that he is doing something that has to be done. Then we have Milla who is good, bad things had happened to her but she rose above it. At the end you feel she has made Diaz human and redeemed him.<br />Not so for this book. I look for a good read from Linda Howard, but this was a disgusting hero and heroine. Maybe the world needs people like these. But I sure don't want to read about them.	2004-07-15

Full of fun and fantasy. These are not erotic fairy tales, but wonderful journeys into the realms of myths, magic, and monsters. Sometimes the monsters are human.<br />This was an exquisite experience.  Each tale is very different, but all four are good. As with any good fairy tale the is a lesson to be learned in each. <br />In one we have a painter who can't see what is really before his eyes.<br />In two (my favorite) we have a delightful Lynn Kurland story, that reminds us sometimes our loved ones are not who we think they are.<br />In three we find a world where angels are real and have a day to day relationship with man.<br />In four one of the fey finds that being human is more than the flesh we wear.<br />This book was like a breath of fresh air.

I have often wondered if a woman was turned by a vampire, did she have to be evil? In DARK GOLD we found that her lifemate was able to save Alex.<br />I wondered if Skyler could be saved and welcome the love of a lifemate after all that she had been through. Well it seems to me this book answers all those questions.<br />As well as the question of a vampire finding his lifemate too late. The one question I didn't get answered is;  What if his lifemate is old when he finds her?  I had hoped to find that answer with Velda and Vikirnoff, but she wasn't his lifemate.<br />This book has all of the things we look for in a DARK book. However, Christine has more in store for us. The questions are there and I'll bet she has the answers. I can hardly wait.<br />Destiny was kidnapped at 6 years old, after watching a vampire kill her parents. In her anguish she screams psychially and connects with Nicolae who helps her get through several years of abuse and horror. Whenever she calls out, he is there.  He opens his mind to her and and shares each and every indignity visited on her by her captor, he then teaches her to kill the vampire. She is 14 before she is strong enough to free herself of the vampire.<br />Nicolae has searched for her all these years.  He does not know she is his lifemate, until she speaks to him telepathically after several more years. She fears he is what she had to kill to escape, another vampire.  Although he has tried to tell her the difference between Carpathians and vampires. She no longer has any trust.<br />When Nicolae and Vikirnoff find her, they find a group of vampires who have bonded in a new way.  Because of the vampire taint in her blood the vampires, at first think Destiny is one of them.<br />There seems to be a great plot in force to destroy all the hunters so that they can rule the world.<br />There is a strange alliance amoung these vamps.  Although several of the women in this place are psychic the vamps are not trying to convert them. There is also a lot of unusual violence against men and women by their most loving and trusted friends and lovers. But Nicolae and Destiny can find no trace of control by the vamps in these attacks.<br />Fighting vampires and Destiny's distrust, Nicolae must find a way to reach her and save not only himself but Destiny from the horror of the tainted vampire blood.<br />Gregori and Savannah make an appearance toward the end of the book to help Nicolae save both himself and Destiny.  They are near because they have just helped Dayan save his lifemate and new daughter. (DARK MELODY)<br />I loved the richness of this world and I think Christine is branching out into a more fully developed world with a fuller texture and understanding of the characters she has brought to life.<br />Don't miss this one.	2004-07-12
US	45775115	R2K6X7O3HCH8C1	0345463927	442557067	Dead Wrong	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Good suspense read.	This is the first Mariah Stewart novel I have read. It has a good plot and is intended to be part of a 3 book series. However, each book stands alone.<br />Three men, one a serial killer, one who murdered his wife and sons, and one young man who is just enraged, meet in a room at a courthouse. They talk about who they would kill if they could do it without being caught.<br />As they talk they tell each other who they want dead. One says if we did it for each other no one would be able to blame us. They speculate on the deed, but call it a game.<br />Later the serial killer starts with the young man's list. The suspense is well done. And it truly is hard to find a reason for the deaths when the suspected killer is in jail.<br />I think it is a well written, engrossing novel. I enjoyed it, and I look forward to the next two; DEAD CERTAIN and DEAD EVEN.	2004-07-09

It has all of the mix you look for in a Dinah McCall/Sharon Sala book.<BR>In several of her books we are asked to believe something that is obviously not true. This has never been a problem if the characters are real enough.<br />Joesph and Raine are real enough for me. Even Benny and his search for the easy way are familiar. The billionaire looking for what his money can't buy is real.<br />I cried when Joseph and Raine buried their son. I felt their struggle to come togather again.<br />As I often say, I read for pleasure.  This book was a pleasure. It may have been alittle predictable, but everything turned out alright in the end.  That's what counts for me.	2004-07-09

To the dismay of her friends and father.<br />But whatever a man is will come out, and Rebecca finds all the quiet strength and goodness in Jackson.<br />Jackson has many secrets and one by one they are revealed. This is one of Sharon Sala's best as far as I am concerned. Her books always give me hope for man's humanity.	2004-07-09

However, in the prologue she tells us this is not one of her usual books. And it is not.<br />This is a different type of book for her. It has very well drawn characters but I just did not come to care for them as much as I usually do.<br />Of course it is set in the west at a time of struggle and fighting as well as many decievers.<br />A saloon girl, a fraudulant preacher, a gambler and a drunk, each has his or her life changed in a split second. When the unscrupulous preacher dies in the lady's bed.<br />There is humor and irony aplenty in this book. Somehow where there is a will there is a way.<br />At the end each is redeemed by their experiences. The ending is somewhat ambiguious and did not really satisfy me. <br />Everyone should be able to stretch their wings and Ms Sala certainly changed from our usual expectations.	2004-07-09

This is the fifth in Suzanne brockmann's S.E.A.L. series for Mira books. It is just as good as the first three.  I thought the fourth EVERYDAY AVERAGE JONES was not as good.<br />Harvard is the only black member of this SEAL team, and we have been waiting for his story.<br />When FinCOM agents are training with SEAL teams anything can't happen, they have rules. Like only 8 hour days. No out of country training missions, limited runs, etc. <br />Joe Cat needs for them to realize that they can't do what the SEAL's can. One of the agents is P J Richards, a woman. He wants the members of his team to become friends with one of the FINK agents. Turns out the best agent is PJ.<br />Harvard has trouble seeing her as an agent and as capable as she is.  This causes trouble between them from the start.<br />PJ is not a trusting soul either.  The dance of working together and romantic attraction leads to other problems. Over the course of 8 weeks they manage to overcome most of their problems.<br />However, on a planned mission, fubar happens. PJ and Harvard are the only ones in place who can rescue Joe Cat who has been shot and captured by tangos. With several Marines dead, they know they only have one chance and very little time.<br />As with all of Brockmann's books everything works out at the end and we have a good time with these characters.	2004-07-04

I only bought STARDOC because I didn't think I would like the book.  Instead I loved it. This book reminds me of the old Science Fiction Classics.  It depends more on characters than it does on science.<br />As soon as I read it I rushed out and bought the rest of them. Five in all and each one better than the last.<br />If you like Elizabeth Moon I think you will love these books. The characters are well rounded and you have some to love and some to hate.<br />Escaping Earth is a must for Dr. Cherijo Grey Veil. The drama of the clinic and the response of aliens not only to humans, but to each other is well done.<br />This is an older book and there are lots of reviews. After you read them, make up your own mind. As for myself I really loved the series. Each book got better and better. I hope there will be a new one soon.	2004-07-03

This book is 8 dollars and it is not worth 2.<br />The anita story is so dumb, I am tired of all the weird boyfriends, not to mention girlfriends. Hamilton writes a good book, but her short stories are not so hot.<br />Eileen Wilks is one author I have never read before. I did not care at all for the story. With a name like cravings and 3 good authors we should get at least 3 good stories.<br />But Rebecca york even lets us down. I loved all the moon books. Witching Moon was my favorite.  However, when they say a wolf mates for life, I thought he mated for his life. Obviously with this story we learn he mates for her life. I felt she let us down on this one.<br />DEAD GIRLS DON'T DANCE is funny and gives us a glimpse of her next book. UNDEAD AND UNEMPLOYED. So for my part MaryJanice Davidson is still a good read.	2004-07-02

Her name is Dara Prince and her father is the guardian of <BR>Christine and Jeremy Ireland. We are lead through the search  for her killer by Deputy Michael Winter.<br />It seem Dara although only 19 was very promiscuous and she was probably killed by one of her lovers.

A very nice read.	2004-07-02

But with his death she finds herself plunged into a mystery, not only for today but a mystery connected to a spy during WWII. <br />Ian Marshall is a Nazi Hunter that her husband contacted before he was killed. He has his own reasons for hunting the spy.<br />We learn the whole story, through flashbacks that touch our hearts. A wonderful love story that didn't have a proper end. <br />Togather, through twists and turns we are kept on edge looking for our spy. This book truely has a different and wonderful ending.  I greatly enjoyed the adventure and romance.	2004-07-02

And what an end!<br />This is one of those unique books like Patti O'Shea's RAVYN'S FLIGHT. You can't put it down. Everyone wants a man who is strong, and devoted and Nearly impossible to find outside a book.<br />The story is fun, and full of suspense with a great romance and very graphic love scenes.

I have been spoiled by Melanie Jackson and Kim Harrison.  This is somewhat like the Glen Cook series, about a supernatural P.I. But it really has an H. P. Lovecraft feel to it.<br />The story was intriging and the characters were weird in a totally immoral deathless way.  Did I say deathless?  Well not quite, alot of people ( or things ) do die in the book. <br />I have alot of questions about Taylor. But maybe we'll learn more in the next few books.<br />I really didn't care for it too much myself, but alot of people seemed to in the reviews.  <br />As I said I like Melanie Jackson for a wild ride on the Wildside, but This, is the Nightside.	2004-06-22

As someone pointed out it is set in Savannah,Ga however, the ambiance was very similiar.    After being abandoned in a cemetery as a baby, our heroine is now a grown woman, a cop on the SPD.  When a series of murders starts her on a search for her roots, she finds herself caught up in the Voo-Doo underground of the city.    Young prostitutes male and female are dying and coming back to life before they die again. This is upsetting the coroner and his assistants.     The trail leads to an escort service headed by  Savannah's most famous voo-doo priestess. The deaths go back two years and don't seem connected at first.      This really is a well written story, and while I personally don't believe in curses, there was alot of suspense and thrills.  All in all a very enjoyable read.	2004-06-22

The interaction between Joe and her children is wonderful. How does a loner like Joe deal with an eleven year old boy and an eight year old girl.<br />No one writes better heart-felt romances, the emotional rollercoaster is unbelievable. I loved it.

It is a light, entertaining read. Kinley MacGregor is also Sherrilyn Kenyon, therefore I expect to get a good read from her books. Although some of this is not accurate history, we are reading for fun not history.<br />Stryder is the kind of man any woman, of any time, would want. He is strong, caring, determined, as well as tall, dark and handsome.<br />Rowena is a strong woman, trying to make sense of the maddness in the world at that time.

It was a good read, but the plot was a little too predictable to me. <br />It took half the book to get her to beleive he was a real vampire. Although he had already bit her neck and drank her blood. They had already shared nightmares and she had come to care for him. She still betrayed him to Gavin.<br />According to the book he is a prime. It seems all they do is think about, and have (...). I'm not complaining, I just knew from the first chapter that they would somehow wind up in the hands of his captors. <br />Why couldn't he get blood from someone else, if he was so determined not to suck on her neck, And he needed it so bad.<br />I finished the book and I will buy her next one.  But I hope the capturing is out of her system.  It seems that in every one of the last few vampire books I have read, someone wants Immortality. They think they only have to capture a vampire to get it.<br />She could have left out about 100 pages and still got the same book.	2004-06-03

The rallying point The Shadow Voice and the Shadow Runners. <br />Both books were awesome.<br />THE SHADOW RUNNERS does not let you down.  You barely have time to breathe.

I noticed the editorial review said it was too romantic. I did'nt find it so.<br />Jane was in a tragic accident when she was 15. After many hospitalizations and restorational plastic surgery she has become an artist, and married Ian.<br />Her constant moaning about fearing the return of the unknown assailant, who was driving the boat that hit her, is kind of stupid to me.  She takes her sister's boyfriend (Ian),and marries him. She and her sister have a very hostile relationship.To start with, she has inherited 20 million dollars and Stacy got nothing. You would think she would not have let herself interfear with her sister's relationship.<br />We are told that Ian just dated Stacy, but he fell in love with Jane. Jane is very insecure both in her private and public life.<br />When her husband is accused of murder, he lies to the police. He tells her, after he is in jail,that he did it to protect her. They don't seem to have a very trusting relationship.<br />If Dave, who is her best friend, needs money why doesn't he just ask her for a loan. Heck, she is loaded.<br />Then her sister and her partner begin to try to help her prove Ian is innocent. While more and more evidence points to him. We know he is innocent if the evidence points to him!<br />The plot is very twisting, and somewhat unbelievable. I read to be entertained and it was something of a chore to finish this book.<br />It left me with an unfinished feeling. Maybe we will get another book featuring Stacy. I just found it hard to relate to the characters in this one. It simply felt like something was missing at the end. As a matter of fact, I would like to learn Stacy's story.  I found her to be the more interesting character. <br />a	2004-05-29

It is not a great suspense novel, the suspense is of the mild type.  The romance is good and the suspense was good enough for me.<br />Dallas and Patience are worlds apart in their careers, but love doesn't understand careers. I liked the tangle of emotions they had to go through.<br />I really enjoyed the facts about rodeos. I have never been interested in them, but some of the things I learned were fasinating.<br />This is not a spectacular book.  But it is a warm, fulfilling read. That is what I look for in a book, not great soul-searching, or drama, but a warm, cozy, feeling when you finish it.	2004-05-28

I am so tired of everyone claiming to be insane,  when they find themselves in an unbelievable position.<br />Zain and Lacey are great characters, and the book is great. I just can't believe anyone would think they were dreaming, or insane when they can feel and see everything around them.<br />Get past the first chapter and you are in for a great read. I loved Reene, an amazing AI, and Pio, an amazing alien, not to mention Bobzilla. <br />There is enough excitement for everyone. Not to mention they get to save the world.<br />A wonderful romance is included, and Lacey is not dumb, she is very smart and with her help Zain is able to foil his worst enemy and clear his name of murder.<br />This is a smart, fun, read.

Tru is a very strong woman, but very innocent when it comes to men.<br />Rayce on the other hand, is very experienced. The romance is very good.<br />However, the story is better, a search for treasure amoung the stars. With a great deal of excitement and adventure along the way. The story is fast paced, and very well thought out.<br />I loved it. I am so pleased we are getting these types of good books now. <br />JUST A NOTE:  GOOD SF/ROMANCES ARE WONDERFUL.

They forgave her to easily.)<br />Anyway, ten years later he finds her at the center of the murder of a governatorial candidate. He gives up everything to protect her, she is the only witness.<br />This could have been just another same old same thing.  However, it is not, no cliches here. The author took an old plot and made it new.  I liked it alot.<br />I especially like novels set in New Orleans. I don't want to give any secrets away. But this book is one hot, thrilling, ride.

Another one of those books you read in one sitting.<br />Autumn Adams (aka Audie) has taken her mother's place as Homey Helen, an advice guru to the Martha Stewart crowd. But someone has been sending her threatening notes. Finally she calls in the police. Sounds familiar right?

And a wonderfully humorous attraction between her and Quinn. You will be wishing to have a loving family like the Quinns, too.<br />As the stalker gets more violent in his notes, we are truly mistified as to why any one would want to harm Audie. <br />From the wonderful characters to the twisting plot, I was enthralled.

I read it in one sitting, that tells you I enjoyed it. It is not a spine tingling adventure, however it was entertaining.<br />Kelly Santos is an orphan, she returns to New Orleans when her mentor, Sister Grace dies. She also has the SIGHT, and it is very strong in her. It has kept her separated from most other people. She is a photographer.

Jack remembers her from school, he also remembers that she is the one who told him to follow his heart into law enforcement.  When the body is found he is assigned to the case.<br />From here on it is a fast-paced adventure, romance, with a little paranormal activity thrown in. <br />I liked it. It was fun to read. The story flowed easily and didn't get bogged down. It is not a 5 star read, but easily a 4 star read. A wonderful way to pass a rainy afternoon.<br />I hardily recommend this book.	2004-05-13

The first is the LEGEND OF BANZAI MACGUIRE, This book is just as good as the first.<br />Day Daniels is a RCMP,  she is a survivor of the bio-plagues that were unleashed on Canada.  She is tough, determined, and very stubborn about the Law she serves.<br />Lian Firebird is a doctor who has had to face the tragedy of losing his family, as well as fighting for the survival of the citizens of Canada. He also has some very important friends, and  some very unusual secrets. He is with Health Canada, an agency that seems to compete with the Mounties for tax money.<br />Both are strong characters who must find a way to work together. The first thing they have to do is trust each other (easier said than done).<br />Canada has been quarantined for more than a century.  She has had to survive alone.  <br />Kathleen Nance has given us a very believable world.  IT is very fine tuned. So many things we take for granted, they have to re-invent in their isolation. <br />Day is assigned to work with Lian.  She is determined to find the killer of her partner Luc. <br />From the first page to the last we follow a trail of action and adventure as well as a romance. <br />I loved it and look forward to the rest of the series.	2004-05-12

I read a great deal and some authors I buy because of their name.<br />Dead on the Dance Floor, is a good book. If you like the world of dance you will probably like it. It has alot about dances and dancers.<br />While I find it hard to tell a tango from a cha-cha, The murder mystery was well written.  I liked the main characters  but somehow there was little doubt who the murderer was. I figured out who, early. It was only near the end I figured out why and how. When the author gave us alittle more information.<br />As far as the secondary characters, I found it hard to care about people who had nothing better to do than spend a great deal of time and money on dancing contests, bars, and flashy costumes.<br />These were some of the most unlikeable characters I've ever read about.  Somehow the Dr. and his wife were the worst.<br />Frankly, by the end I didn't care who killed her. <br />For the best read by Heather Graham, I recommend DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS or PICTURE ME DEAD.	2004-05-12

I usually love her books, however, I am very tired of political, suspense novels. All of the books about the Winters family have some politics in them, but this had so much political stuff it turned me off.<br />Nate Winters is the brother of Antonia Winters who married Hank Callahan in a previous book. He of course was running for senator.  He won.<br />Nate is also the brother of Carine Winters who finally married Tyler North in another novel.<br />This book highlights a wonderful family, the Dunnemores.  Rob is a deputy Marshall, Sarah, his twin, is a historical archeologist. By the time you finish this book you'll know what that is.  We also have their parents, grandparents, and the President of the United States, who thinks of Sarah as his own.<br />With that list of characters not to mention the list of bad guys, this book could have been 2 or 3 books.<br />I am just tired of politics. My daughter bought the book for me. She read it and said it was a nice read.<br />This novel is not about normal people. Okay, so maybe I mean regular people. I just could not get into the story, or the romance.<br />As a obsessive reader I did read it all.  I couldn't help it. If I start a book I have to finish it. But I wish I hadn't started this one.<br />With this many familiar characters you would think the book would flow easily and entertainingly. But it did not for me.	2004-05-11

Her family has never believed her.  She has stayed away from them and their friends because she thinks one of them did it. Now at 32 she is trying to come out of her shell.<br />Jane is called in when a serial rapist strikes again, in her own home town. She has not been able to help the last 3 times he struck.  But some people believe she is their only hope.<br />Ray Vanover is the FBI agent in charge. He is scarred inside and out by a bomb, a militant group placed in his car. The woman he thought he loved, another FBI agent, died in the explosion.<br />Jane has an empathy with victims, and she is able to get them to relax enough for her to get a sketch of their attackers.<br />However, because of her rape she is blocked when she tries to sketch this rapist.<br />I enjoyed the police procedures, the insights, and the romance that developes between these two characters.<br />If you are looking for a deep, heavy read, this is not it. <BR>If you are looking for a nice, quiet, comfortable read this is it. This is entertainment. Just what I needed.<br />I really enjoyed it after some of the stuff I've read lately.	2004-05-11

I checked to be sure it was by Carla Neggers.  It is, but it is a reprint of an older book.<br />She has gotten so much better than this.<br />Our heroine, a musician, had a short affair with our hero, an investigative reporter ten years ago. She has come back to Florida to find herself. <br />One of our hero's snitches, tells him that she is probably involved with a cat burgler. So our hero has to find out because he still has feelings for her (possibly he is just nosy).<br />Anyway we are led on through the book by unsubstantiated inuendos. It is clear that if she is innocent, someone else must be guilty.  <br />But not only do we have a jewel thief, we have an enforcer, and a very disfunctional family.  I knew who the thief was all the time.  But the rest of this boring mess was unbelievable to me.<br />I usually love Carla Neggers books, and You will too. But this reprint was before she hit her stride. <br />I think publishers try to trick us into buying older books with new covers and as you can tell, They got me.	2004-05-10

This is a fast-paced, well plotted story.<br />Romantic suspense should have a great romance, inside a great mystery.  This book has both. I have read some of her other books and while they are passable, this one is great.<br />Campbell Cody is a likable, brave, determined woman.  She is willing to go the extra mile for a friend. And when that friend disappears under strange circumstances, she sets out to find her.<BR>Although Campbell has learned that life is not always just, that many, even in law enforcement are as corrupt as criminals, she is not. She still believes in right and wrong.<br />Jackson Blade is an undercover cop who has learned the same lessons as Campbell. Where she hasn't let life defeat her, Blade has just existed since his life was turned up-side down.<br />These two are brought together by seemingly unconnected crimes.  However, as the plot moves forward, they realize they are on the same trail.  <br />Working together to solve the mystery, they find what is missing in their lives, in each other.  The mystery is solved, and two lonely people come to know themselves, in a very suspenseful and exciting way.<br />Overall, this is the best Helen R Myers book I have read.	2004-05-10

I really wish she would write more in this universe. <br />Orchid Adams is one of my favorite characters. After hearing about her in AMARYLLIS, and ZINNIA, we finally meet her in this book.<br />Orchid writes PV (psychic vampires)novels. Imagine her surprise to meet a real PV, while she works as a 10+ Prism.  A prism is a psychic who helps a psychic with a talent,use his talent. Sound confusing?  It really isn't. It is just nature's way of controlling powerful psychics.<br />Rafe Stonebraker is a powerful talent.  He's looking for a wife, since he is a strat-talent  (hunting and tracking), one looked on as somewhat exotic, he decides to hunt his own wife.  His biggest problem is that he is an off the wall talent. In other words he's more than a 10.  Which would make other people wary, if they knew. He would be considered a PV.<br />He also has a list of qualities he is looking for in a mate, because there is no divorce on St. Helens. Added to that he needs to marry before taking over Stonebraker Shipping.<br />Rafe is an undercover detective, for a select few who know about him. His new case concerns an Ice prism, who supposedly stole an ancient relic. It turns out that Orchid is an Ice prism, too.  She is also a friend of the Ice prism he is investigating. It seems Ice prisms are few and hard  to find.<br />With a mind and stubornness all her own, she and Rafe set out to find the truth.<br />From a green and blue wedding in Northville to A showdown with another strat-talent, Rafe and Orchid entertain us to the max.<br />I loved this book and didn't want it to end.  Enjoy!!!!!	2004-05-06

This book has all the things you look for in an Amanda Quick novel.<br />Unlike her last three books, we have a wonderful heroine, Elenora Lodge, who has lost everything because of her step-father. Like the best Quick heroines, she doesn't take it lying down.  She has a PLAN. <br />A little (very little) downcast, she is seeking a new job as a paid companion, when our hero, Arthur, the Earl of St Merryn enters.<BR>He is seeking a lady to play his bethrothed. <br />Through twists and turns, with humor and wit, we follow the adventures of the merry pair. Arthur is hunting the killer of his uncle, and plans to detour the marriage minded ton away, by introducing Elenora to them as his fiancee.<br />Both soon discover they are well matched in the brains department and Elenora becomes Arthur's partner in the search for a killer. They not only find adventure, they also find each other. <br />I really enjoyed this book.  From the descriptions of a weary, marital-minded aristocracy, to the passionate love scenes, this is pure Quick.<BR>Thanks Amanda!	2004-05-04

One man, one woman, one night = one baby.  Of course the baby is kidnapped and then the father is the only one who can help find her, or him in this case.<br />I will say it is nice to hear a man admit that it wasn't all her fault.  He can accept that he is equally at fault for the pregnancy.  However, He can't be a loving husband and father because of a bad experience with his first wife.<br />The Protectors is a good series.  But this plot has been done to death, and even Beverly barton can't save it.<br />I wonder if it is a set-up for her next book. Maybe about Kate or Dante.<br /> A very so-so read.	2004-05-03

I bought if for Romantic Suspense. Which it is to a certain extent. But Get REAL!! This is an attempt to mainstream a type of erotic novel better left off the suspense shelf. <br />The first few pages were GREAT!!  I thought o'boy, this will be good.  The premise is GREAT!  I loved the thought of people who are lonely looking for love on the internet.  It is real, it happens.  BUT, looking for someone to dominate you or force your submission, is kinky.  With all the abuse in the world, Who would be foolish enough to let someone you haven't ever seen do those kind of things to you.<br />As a doctor, she has seen alot. Surely she has some kind of sense of self preservation. <br />This is erotica.  Good for eroticia, not good as romantic (what's romantic about bondage and submission?) suspense.	2004-05-02

According to this Suzanne Brockmann book he's a user.  I bought this book the day it came out. I have started to read it 4 times, and am only on page 165. Jimmy Nash so far has no redeeming qualities. He uses women, loves his buddy, and broods about his past.  So sounds like any other Brockman,  Right?  WRONG!  This guy may be gorgeous, but he is NOT likable, and if he has a heart, it must be stone.<br />Tess is a likable character, and we can identify with her for her attraction to Nash.  But she seems a little bit in need of self confidence. I will eventually finish this book. After all I paid alot for it. But I think I'll wait for some other customer reviews on the next one.<br />Decker and Sophia will be more interesting as we go along. (I hope)  Maybe this is another Sam and Alyssa type story to follow through other books. Who knows. <br />But this is definitely not one of her best. I recommend NIGHT WATCH. <br />I did skip to the end to get a booster for my Sam and Alyssa addiction.	2004-05-02

Toste and Vagn have been some of my favorite characters all along.<br />The twins join the Jomvikings and in a battle both think the other is killed. They have never been apart for long and both are devestated.<br />Toste is saved by nuns, one of which is Lady Esme or (Eat me) as Toste hears her name.<br />Vagn is saved by Gorm who wants Toste (mistakenly thinking Vagn is Toste) to marry his daughter, Helga, the homely. <br />Bolthar is along to entertain us with his wonderful sagas.<br />To many details spoil the plot, but you will not be disappointed. <br />All of our favorite characters are back to aid the brothers to find true love at last.  Not without a laugh or two, or more.	2004-05-02
US	45775115	RFU79SSVRMPD9	0553803409	717880439	Firestorm	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Leave your skepticism at the door	I had a little trouble with the premise of comas inducing psychic powers.  However, the book was fast paced, had some surprises, and was overall entertaining. If you want a fact based story, you can read non-fiction or the newspaper. For exciting, action-adventure with a good romance. I read Iris Johansen.  I have to admit saving the world every time seems a little redundent.  But again, I read for fun. This book filled an afternoon very well. Maybe it  follows a similar scenerio as other books by her, I was so glad to get away from the rugged, handsome assassins in the last three books. Not that I did'nt love the books, or the men.  Where do I find one? But reading is fun, and it is an escape from other worries. So go for it. For myself, I enjoyed this book!	2004-04-25

The sight isn't a pleasant gift to Laurel, it's a curse.  However, to us it is a delight.  I usually dislike the way some characters complain about having a gift like this.  If I had it, I hope I would use it for good.  Our heroine finally realizes this, and with the help, and love of Justin,(who was a slave and knew Laurel in a previous life) she finds love, caring people, and a Place to call home. With good plotting, very well defined characters and an exciting adventure, Sharon Sala (Dinah McCall) has given us an interesting, entertaining way to spend an afternoon. I read to be entertained and I was well pleased.You will be too.	2004-04-25

The story of an abused wife and mother who finally takes action will not be new. However the tension, feelings, and fear of Mary Grace Winters is presented in a moment by moment way that keeps you on the edge of your chair, bed or floor. Wherever you choose to read.  We are not kept in the dark about the feelings and motives of her husband or the man, (Max) who sees the kindness, generosity, and love that Caroline ( AKA Mary Grace ) has to offer.  After seven years the worst happens and her policeman husband finds out she and her son are alive.  With exquisite detail we follow him on his hunt.  We follow Caroline as she finally becomes the woman she was meant to be.  We see the dark edges of her soul and the ravages of horror meated out to her and her child. I could not put it down. You will not be disappointed. Spine-chilling suspense, unusual twists, and a great ending. Go for it.	2004-04-18
US	45775115	R1UI9IVN368R5Q	0446612812	841117264	Have You Seen Her?	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Exciting, Chilling, and A Good Romance	I bought this book because I liked &quot;Don't Tell&quot; so much.  Ms.Rose uses the same sense of immediacy in this book as in the other.  The story was very well plotted and I had no idea who the killer was until the end...Well I thought I knew.  But she totally had me fooled.  If you enjoy a good suspenseful mystery with a great love story, like I do, You will not be able to put it down.  Better than a movie at half the price.	2004-04-18

If you read \\"After Dark\\" you probably enjoyed it even more. The sense of a fully fleshed out world is awesome. The sexual tension between Lydia and Emmett is great. I love the way each worries about the feelings of the other. The dance of romance is Jayne at her best.  From Lydia's determination to protect Emmett,  to his worries about her feelings for ghost-hunters, we are constantly waiting for the explosions to begin.  However, Jayne Castle, knows what we want. I just loved the Restoration Ball and The DRESS. Two hearts wanting the same thing but scared to reach out too quickly.  The suspense and stirring adventure are not overshadowed by the romance, and the thrilling conclusion is wonderfully enhanced by Fuzz and a number of unusual and fasinating characters. Could not put it down.  I have already reread it 4 times. (UNBELIEVABLE for me.) I usually don't like to read a book that continues a relationship, but this one is perfect. This is a keeper. And be sure to get \\"After Dark\\" also.	2004-04-15

That is my all time favorite.  This is a good even great read.  Anything by Kenyon is going to be very readable. My only problem with this one is Wulf's obsession with his descendant Chris.  I loved the &quot;unanswered &quot; yet intriging questions about Ash, Stryker, and Esspecially Katra. My dislike and even disgust with Artemis and Apollo are growing exponentially with every book. However, I wouldn't miss a one. This world seems to expand so much with each adventure. All of our favorites from other books make a wonderful short stop to visit in this adventure.  The humanity and compassion make this one of the must read books in the saga. Kenyon makes us care for people we had come to feel were unlovable. I felt the solution to Wulf and Cassie's problem was a little to easy.  But we are left with another great cast member in Urian. A thousand stories I want to know.  Guess we'll just have to wait for one at a time. ARRRRRRGH!!!!!!!	2004-04-15
