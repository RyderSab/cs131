To be honest, the reason I bought it was because the forward is by Danielle Lamothe, who is the education product manager for Alias|Wavefront - in my mind meant that there was some assumption of quality - I was wrong. I sat all afternoon with this book only to discover that the way Maya 4.5 handles dynamics is not the way it is presented in this book - they must have been working with some pre-release version when they wrote the book. I have hit a big brick wall, and the book is useless. It goes back tomorrow.	2003-06-15

Not only to me, but to science. In it,  Schrodinger perdicts the structure of DNA years before Watson and Crick built their model: &quot;...the chromosome fibre - may be called an aperiodic crystal.&quot;<br />This book is where physics and biology first met. It really is one of the great classics of the twentieth century. It will never go out of print.	2001-09-27

The core philosophy can be summed up: &quot;A feature does not exist unless there is a test for it.&quot; (P.83) This means that coders (pairs of programmers in XP) first construct unit tests of product features before the attempt to code the features. What this means in practice, is that the code that XP delivers (continuously in 3 week long iterations) can never be broken!  I'll say that again just to make sure you read it: XP code can never be broken! I really think XP's adaptive, test-first philosophy is the best thing that has happened to software engineering since Dijkstra told us that the &quot;Goto Statement is Considered Harmful&quot; in 1968.<br />This book is the best of the XP series if you've actually made the decision to use XP. If you're not sure about what XP is or what it's limitations are, go to google and do your homework. When you're ready to actually install an XP project, get this book.	2001-04-25

This updated classic (2nd edition is 11 years old,) is both current and complete  (it contains the most recent findings dervied from Hubble and VLT observations.)

Alibek is likely the most informed person on the planet when it comes to the realities of bioweapons, because he was directly responsible for making and testing the worst of them.

I've been training artificial neural networks for over a decade and reading literature my entire life. This is the first time I've seen someone who really knows how to write, write knowingly about the process of  knowing.<br />The &quot;1980's era technical jargon&quot; that a previous  reviewer claims is tossed around carelessly is, speaking as someone who  actually works every day with neural networks, remarkably well informed,  and perfectly used. The only flaw in Power's idea being that his concept of  what constitutes a training set is exceptionally unrealistic.<br />The future  will see artificial consciousness come into being, much as Power's  speculates. The training set however, will be much more exhaustive than  Power's has imagined... millions, if not billions of consensus facts all  entered and validated by millions of internet users.<br />But I digress... the  book stands well above its one flaw.

How can someone read Weiner,and Shannon and McKay and not understand that the only difference between you and me is the same as the difference between any two MP3's - BITS.<br />To be human is not dependent on a specific physicality as Hayles asserts, it is dependent only on information (which itself requires a minimum physicality, though not specific).<br />Yes, Katherine, for a bit to exist it must have a physical embodiment. But it doesn't matter what type of matter that body is made of, be it carbon or silicon, neuron or ram.<br />We're all just very long and complex binary strings in a universe of fundamental particles that are ultimately themselves just shorter binary strings; pure information.

The life a biologist and the biology of life in a charming and compact 200 pages. Bonner's cellular slime molds are just facinating; I can't wait to get somewhere where there is soil (I live in the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile) so I can find some of these creatures  and play with them. If you have any interest in biology or evolution, get  youself a copy. It will make you smile. I promise.	2000-03-24

My professors all got very uncomfortable when I started asking this in my third year. This made me so unconfortable with my choice in profession that I changed it. Now I just  give people copies of this book, and KNOW I am helping them.	2000-03-24

The book is great; very high quality. I was worried that it was only 48 pages... but they are 48 very well executed pages with amazing photographs  and clear descriptions of the 9 month long water baby program.<br />I am a  Canadian living in Chile, and bringing a baby to the pool shocked the very  conservative Chileans. But when they saw the pictures in the book, and my 2  month old son swimming underwater, suddenly all the babies in our condo  were in the pool.	2000-03-16

No true scientist can claim to be an Atheist. They simply don't have the information to make such a claim. A scientist must be agnostic. In this book, Dawkins is no Atheist, he is agnostic. He does show us how it is possible for  life to have appeared with no outside intervention or  planning. The entire book would be mere conjecture (as is every book on the  otherside of this arguement) it weren't for the fact the artificial  genetics work exactly as Dawkins describes. Those that argue that evolution  can't work, are simply ignorant of current science (with emphasis on the  intentionality implied by the root of ignorant - ignore).	2000-03-05

The good fine arts programs require it, as do thoughtful private teachers. An Artist needs a philosophy more than  paint or canvas. This book will show you what a very good one looks like and help you identify your own.	2000-03-04

Not many of London's regular fans liked this book, a little too real for them I suppose. But, writers love this book and with good reason. If you write and  haven't read this, put it in your shopping cart right now. If you're  looking for a classic Jack London adventure story, skip this one.	2000-03-03

Sometimes you've just got to read what the guys on the other side of the fence are saying. The antidote to this book is Dawkins' 'The Blind Watchmaker', and of course, vice versa. However, I have seen with my own  eyes self-orginization work. I have seen simulated evolution work. Anyone  in doubt should search the web and take a look at Karl Sims' artificially  evolved swimming fish... you will instantly recognize them as life. This  book was a lot of work, but ultimately, it is just wrong.	2000-03-02

I have flown over the Andies between Mendoza and Santiagio many, many times. Every time I do, this book creeps into my mind. I look down and say to myself, could I have survived?

From the first paragraph (see below), it is obvious that this is an exceptional work. It reads like a novel, but goes deeper into the nature of reality than any novel can ever hope to. Read this book for the story and  gain a first class education in physics, history, history of science and  the politics of the past century. While I was reading this book, during my  long nights operating the world's largest telescope, visiting astronomers  would continuously pick up the book and begin reading... more than one went  to the web and bought their own copies when I asked for mine back. This is  as good as non-fiction gets.<br />&quot;In London, where Southhampton Row  passes Russell Square, across from the British Museum in Bloombury, Leo  Szilard waited irritably one gray Depression morning for the stoplight to  change. A trace of rain had fallen during the night; Tuesday, September 12,  1933, dawned cool, humid and dull. Drizzling rain would begin in early  afternoon. When Slizard told the story later he never mentioned his  destination that morning. He may have had none; he often walked to think.  In any case another another destination intervened. The stoplight changed  to green. Slizard stepped off the curb. As he crossed the street time  craked open before him and he saw a way to the future, death into the world  and all our woe, the shape of things to come.&quot;	2000-03-02

You won't find here pages of source code that you could have easily ftp'd yourself. What you will find is solid theory in a mere 224 pages. This is the quickest and best way to get up to  speed on GA's there is. Which is why it is a standard textbook in the  field.	2000-02-21

I would have been much more interested to read more about Kanzi's day to day behavior and to see some actual scientific data instead of the story of the investigator's scientific publishing woes. Nevertheless, this book should be read widely  and it's message that we humans are not as unique as we like to think needs  careful consideration by all scientists and the general population.	2000-01-10
