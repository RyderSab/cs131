This book displays the abuse of a child that goes on each and every day by trusted friends and family members. Here we have Annette who has been instructed by her mother to do whatever Mr. Buttright tells her. At no point in the book did I feel sorry for Mr. Buttright.

Later in life, Annette becomes friends with Rhoda who is pretty and appears to have a good life but Rhoda has some serious issues going on.<br />Annette's mother was just plain blind . She couldn't see that something was wrong with her child from day to day. Maybe she didn't want to see it. After all, Mr. Buttright was going to marry her after Annette finished school. Scary Mary, the blind girl, Viola and Peewee all played a major part in making this book one that will remain with me for some time. This novel comes highly recommended. Mary Monroe, I applaud you.

I normally read romance novels. The title and cover caught my eye one day while walking through a book store. <br />I really did enjoy this novel from cover to cover. Eva and  Hutch went through a period of fall out of love. I think that alot of  couples go through this sometimes but they must remember what it was about  the person that they fell in love with at first and try to get that fire  going again. I must say the only thing I didn't like about the book was the  affair between Eva and Isaiah. The affair was good for Eva but mother and  daughter shouldn't be involved with the same person. I think that Raye had  a itch for Hutch all along. Raye took too much from Donald. I was glad when  she finally woke up and left him. Donald was a true junk yard dog.<br />This  book covered real issues that families face each day regarding love, hurt,  decisions and  friendship. Mrs. Wesley this is a well written novel. I wish  you much success. For this to be your first romance novel you did an  outstanding job. Be Blessed!	1999-12-13
