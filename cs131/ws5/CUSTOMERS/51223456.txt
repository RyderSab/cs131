Well, I really didn't want to write a negative review of an S. M. Stirling novel; Mr. Stirling lives just up the road from me, is a fellow Newfie and shares many interests such as martial arts and history.  I have enjoyed his books for many years.<br /><br />That said, `The Protector's War' was really a disappointment. A disappointment because Mr. Stirling doesn't appear to have read any of the Amazon reviews of the first book in this series, \\"Dies the Fire.\\"  Large numbers of reviewers, myself included, commented on our dislike of all the Wiccan claptrap, of the negative portrayal of Christianity, and especially of the all-too-convenient emergence of handy characters and skill sets just when needed.<br /><br />In volume two of this trilogy-to-be, these flaws are compounded by semi-flashbacks and a glacial pace of action.  Really, we don't need to know about every trailside weed, especially if that knowledge comes at the cost of a molasses-like plot.  Honestly, pretty much nothing happens in the first half of the book that couldn't be dealt with in a recap-forward and a couple tightly written paragraphs.<br /><br />Yes, \\"The Protector's War' has strengths.  It does a good recap, it is meticulous, and it is honest.  All the favored characters from the first volume are back, and we are nicely brought up to date with the nine-years later plot.  Also, although the editors didn't do great on this book, they restrained the author's tendency to write a lot of unconventional sex into his books.<br /><br />I do hate to bust chops, but I really suggest Mr. Stirling go to some ghost towns (there are plenty near his home), abandoned industrial sites, old farms, and on some nature walks.  Sorry, but nature does not reclaim buildings, roads, and infrastructure at a fraction of the speed he postulates.  Who among us hasn't found a forty year old building still standing or a decades abandoned road quite passable.  And that's in temperate climates!	2005-10-12

If you start by reading the Publisher's Weekly review, you might prefer a poke in the eye with a sharp stick to reading Ghost of the White Nights, and that would be a mistake!<br /><br />The concluding volume of the Columbia-Ghost trilogy is Modesitt's best volume in the series.  It is well-paced, start to finish, it has some interesting plot twists, and the hero, Johan Eschbach, is at his finest.<br /><br />Fans of the series will already understand the basic premise.  Columbia, an alternate-world semi-USA faces the twin threats of chronic oil shortages and Austrian Emperor Ferdinand's plots to dominate the world. Eschbach, spy, professor, war hero, and good guy who wipes the dishes and makes a fair salad, must handle both issues.<br /><br />This time, Eschbach must broker a deal with a creaky Romanov regime, trading technology for oil.  There is plenty of intrigue, and Modesitt really has the Russian character-- proud, paranoid, but ultimately somehow likeable--down pat.<br /><br />It is a shame that Eschbach's ahem--itchy-ahem French wife is still along for the ride, fussing about every bowl of soup, but if you can get past that, White Nights isn't bad at all.  Some odd plot twists like having Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel appear in the alternate universe as an insidiously smarmy US Ambassador to Russia, are a lot of fun, too.<br /><br />White Nights is a significant uptick on the previous volume, Ghost of the Revelator, which had almost nothing in it but the French wife crabbing about the chow!	2005-10-10

The Mayor of Casterbridge is a superbly crafted tale of youthful folly and the futility of repentance.  Set in the early Victorian Wessex beloved of Hardy, the time and place still speak to audiences more than a century after the novel was written.<br /><br />The title character commits one huge act of drunken folly in his youth, to his eternal regret.  He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community.  But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.<br /><br />The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.<br /><br />Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.<br /><br />Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read!  The many TV movies and mini-series do not do it justice!	2005-10-03

Basically, Cumings, a toady of the evil Juche-communist Monarchy in North Korea, has set out to write a skewed and biased history of the peninsula to gloss over the horrors of the most evil state on earth.<br /><br />While there are some snippy little anecdotes that are fun, and a few honest assessments of some of the dastardly deeds of South Korea's less than democratic first few presidents, in general this book is almost as sickening as a if one wrote a defense of the Third Reich thinly disguised as a comprehensive history of Germany.  If an author wrote about out how the Vaterland had been bullied and assaulted by evil Poles and French and Swedes and thus Der Fuhrer was a decent chap who could be understood, most readers would be sickened and historians would condemn the author.  Yer when Cumings does this for North Korea, few complain?<br /><br />No, sorry, this approach to a regime that deliberately allows millions of it's own citizens to starve and condemns tens or even hundreds of thousands more to a near-death in labor camps, no it doesn't wash; not at all.<br /><br />Forget all the moderately sound if skewed history presented-- because the author's point was to justify a Democratic People's Republic that is undemocratic, not a republic, and not run by the people.<br /><br />I lived many years in South Korea, both under dictators and freely elected governments.  I've been in North Korea.  I've been in China dealing with North Korean refugees.  And, yes, I speak Korean and Mandarin, too.  This book is a travesty!	2005-10-03

Unfortunately, the pinkish cover and the female-oriented subtitle may be a bit off-putting to men.  Unfortunately, because the contents are heartfelt accounts the can inspire folk of either gender!<br /><br />The chapters of \\"Our Heart's True Home\\" are honestly told chapters of how over a dozen people left new age practices, Judaism, Catholicism, and various Protestant denominations and found peace and joy in the Holy Orthodox Church.<br /><br />My wife read this book when we were getting disenchanted with our mainstream Protestant denomination, and found it not only moving but also a reality check of what life is like for the Orthodox.  In many ways, this is the great value of this book.  Being Orthodox involves a lot more commitment of time, lifestyle, and physical effort than other Christian communions.  The curious and the seekers will find the foretaste valuable.<br /><br />Well, my wife badgered me into reading this opus and I found it relevant and enjoyable as well, so I recommend it for women AND men.<br /><br />No, this isn't a book of theology or a real apologetic, and readers should not expect that.  I'm also taking one star off because this book is not really of much interested for the incurious or even for most 'cradle Orthodox'.<br /><br />However, at least in America, Orthodoxy is moving from a Church of mainly immigrants, to a church combining third-generation Americans and increasing numbers of converts.  This book is for those joining those ranks.	2005-10-03

It is a superb volume for armchair theologians, clerics of every stripe, those seeking a greater understanding of God in Trinity and human nature, and those wishing a lucid explanation of the differences between the Holy Orthodox Church and more occidental, rational, and secular forms of Christianity.<br /><br />Mystical Theology revolves around several themes such as God's Love, the centrality and inexplicability of Mystery, the importance of the early Church fathers (and mothers), and man's relation to the Godhead.<br /><br />Lossky was one of the great apologists for Orthodoxy in the west from 1923-1958 and his scholarship is peerless.  Reading Mystical Theology is profound and profoundly rewarding, but it takes effort.  No; the book is NOT poorly written- it is clear.  But the concepts presented cause one to go slow, to stop, to ponder, and to pray, sometimes for days.<br /><br />Are you ready to think about the difference between Eastern and Western notions of Grace, about the three hypostases of the Trinity and how the Son is begotten of the Father while the Spirit proceeds from Him?  Are you interested in St. Gregory of Nyssa's intriguing view of Hell and how that relates to the concepts of uncreated energy described by St. Gregory Palamas?<br /><br />If so, you will just love this volume.  It might even be life-changing for you!  Man can never comprehend the Godhead, as Lossky himself points out, but this book will allow us to understand more than we otherwise ever would!	2005-09-29

Murdered and Deified A.D. 54 (Vintage International)	Books	4	4	7	N	N	A good intro to the apogee of Rome.	In modern times, few of us have the luxury of a good classical education, and so most of us come away with little or no knowledge of ancient Rome.  Yet, as evinced by the massive recent popularity of Rome-centric mini-series and many a special on The History Channel, there is a great interest.<br /><br />You could slake your thirst for Roman wine by taking university courses.  You could also try reading Roman history (The Annals of Imperial Rome (Penguin Classics) by Tacitus, The Fall of the Roman Republic: Six Lives (Penguin Classics) by Plutarch, Livy: The Early History of Rome (Books I-V) by Titus Livy, Makers of Rome: Nine Lives by Plutarch (Penguin Classics), and The Rise of the Roman Empire (Penguin Classics) by Polybius).<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of us don't have a Roman epoch to \\"read in.\\"  For us mortals, Robert Graves has a great two-volume set, written in the 1930's and centered on the life of Emperor Claudius, the second-to-last of the Caesars.  Claudius lived through most of the Republic-to-Empire period and his purported autobiography (actually a good compilation of contemporary Roman sources by Graves) presents a well-written and compelling tale.  As Graves himself was one of the translators of Suetonius' \\"Twelve Caesars,\\" you can expect accuracy.<br /><br />Whether you are a novice setting out to read about Rome, or a diehard looking for a sort-of-novelization of the time of the Caesars, by all means read \\"I, Claudius\\" and its follow-on tome, \\"Claudius the God.\\"	2005-09-07

Caleb Carr, historian, professor, and Holmes afficionado, has contributed a small novel to the large collection of post-Conan Doyle \\"undiscovered adventures\\" of the great detective.  In this work, Holmes, Watson, and Mycroft race to Scotland for a mysterious and spooky case where the life of the Dear Old Queen may be in jeopardy!<br /><br />Unlike many latter day works, The Italian Secretary is worth reading.  Carr, a brilliant and bestselling novelist in his own right, catches the pacing, twists, flavour and nuance of the originals--and does so with the blessing of the Conan Doyle estate.  What can I say, but it's high time Homes took a train north of Gretna Green!  Yes, and the story is a lot more credible than Holmes spending his lost years in Tibet.<br /><br />The Italian Secretary may be just a wee bit heavy on the supernatural, but it's intended to complement a collection of such works which the Estate has blessed.  Against this small flaw, one has to set a classic format, which perhaps gives Watson more military skills that ACD did and perhaps gives Mycroft a rather larger role that we are used to, but does so credibly.<br /><br />Still, in all, this is a great work, and not only for lifelong Holmes lovers but for any mystery reader!  The length is just classic for a Holmes novel, too.  Get it without any doubts!	2005-08-23

For those folks, good news and bad.  Let's start with the bad- as with most of Harry's work, this episode is pretty predictable and fractures into the usual microvignettes of various characters scattered across the spectrum of society--North and South- in the South Victorious-leads-to-WWII series.  Another flaw-- the whole first half of the book goes by without a glimpse at the wider world beyond the north-south conflagration.<br /><br />The good news- the book starts out with a bang--literally--and a vignette featuring Jake Featherstone, the 'Confederate Hitler.'  There is better action and a good pace to this latest installment, so don't give up now if you've been reading along.  All your favorite characters are back- Abner Dowling, Sam Carstens, Scipio, Cincinnatus Driver, Armstrong Grimes, etc.  And the historic figures are there, too.  FDR, MacArthur, etc. continue in their previous roles.<br /><br />Turtledove must have heard some previous criticisms of slow pacing, and too much repetition of trivial details, for he seems to have improved.  What hasn't improved is the fractured story line.  There are the usual number of sub-plots if not more.<br /><br />Not great fiction, but a good read for fans of the series!	2005-08-09

Osteen, pastor of one of the largest churches in America, has put out a simplistic tome explaining how, as God's child and a good Christian, you can lead an abundant life.  He explains how to deal with negative thoughts, your baggage from the past, and other personal problems through faith and scripture.<br /><br />It's a very nice concept--but hardly original.  As \\"Wild at Heart\\" was a re-packaging of the 1980's men's movement, Osteen's book here is a re-packaging of psyco-cybernetics, Dale Carnegie, Norman Vincent Peale, and the whole self-help movement.<br /><br />Your Best Life Now reads suspiciously like one of Dr. Phil's self-help books with some scriptural overlay.<br /><br />I'm a Christian and I found this book rather me-centered rather than God-centered.  It seemed self-indulgent.  It seemed to miss the point of a prayerful life of Kingdom Living with the purpose of worshipping the all-holy trinity and restoring and strengthening one's loving communion with the Godhead.<br /><br />I realize most who know the book and the author will disagree and think this book makes a huge difference in their lives and stengthens their faith.  If so, I am delighted.<br /><br />But I felt moved to post a review with another perspective, to give prospective readers a better notion of what lay in store.	2005-08-05

This is the author's third or fourth alternate WWII series and it is getting tiring.  As ever, Turtledove also has too many series of books and new installments are few and far between.  Loyal fans must wait years and years to wrap up each set.<br /><br />Scarier yet is the thought that Turtledove has a template on his computer.  Take a few leaders, a few ordinary Joes (or Akiras in this case?) and switch perspectives every few pages.<br /><br />Other reviewers have also criticised, correcly, the military implausibility of this series.  I'm more willing to suspend belief for the sake of pursuing a fresh alternate history line.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite being interesting in places and having some fun tweaks here and there, the Japanese getting a big edge in WWII is not a fresh idea, any more than Nazis winning WWII or the South winning the civil war.<br /><br />Days of Infamy is same old/same old from the master of repeating himself.

It is basically a Daily Devotional-style classic American Protestant inspirational text.  It is well-referenced and includes very large amounts of scripture and explains Scripture's relationshipto modern life quite well.<br /><br />So, if you are an unbeliever, unsure, or a new Christian, yes, go ahead and buy this fine little book and read it.<br /><br />For those already well-committed to Christianity, Purpose-Driven Life is pretty simplistic.  I know that despite the many scripture references, there are also some glaring omissions.  And rather than Rev. Warren using \\"15 translations\\" I'd have felt better if he were a good scholar of Koine Greek and was reading the Septuagint and the New testament in that tounge and translating it himself.<br /><br />I'd also have felt better if he'd tried to wrap more of the early church fathers and the devotions of the early Christians into his work.  Still, there's hope that he'll follow-up with an intermediate and even a more theologically advanced volume some day!<br /><br />If you are a bit further down the path of Theosis (Santifying Grace/Perfecting Grace, you might give this book a pass and wait for those potential later volumes.

Fans of the Harry Potter series, whether rabid or mild, will have to go out and get this latest installment and enjoy it!  I pre-ordered from our friends here at Amazon and had the book in my mailbox on the morning of the 16th instead of waiting at midnight in an icy rain as one reviewer did.  I don't think that dimished my appreciation of this, the best of the series thus far.<br /><br />The Half-Blood Prince is the most sophisticated and dark of the series to date.  As Harry, Ron, Hermione and other characters grow up, the plots get longer and a lot of the youthful wonder is replaced with brooding atmosphere and dark plot twists.  For instance, one notable character dies in this volume.<br /><br />This installment misses a bit of charming youthful allure, but the more powerful plot lines make up for it.  Starting off with a harassed Tony Blair interacting with a harassed Cornelius Fudge, the book is full of omens and portents.  But, of course, it still centers on Harry and Hogwart's and, as ever, progresses through the academic year and introduces a new \\"defense against the dark arts\\" teacher.<br /><br />A star and a half off-the top because the plot is a bit predictable and the book is just too long.  It's cumbersome and has grown to a length that should be reserved for classics like Atlas Shrugged or War and Peace.  Otherwise, it's not a bad summer reading selection and is more adult than the previous volumes.	2005-07-18

Formerly with the South China Morning Post, he left when that paper's increasing toadying to the Beijing regime grew oppressive.  Becker continues on today at the prestigious Christian Science Monitor and continues to write about east Asia, as he has long done.  His books \\"Hungy Ghosts\\" and \\"The Chinese\\" are definitive and widely respected.<br /><br />Now Becker turns his talents towards North Korea, a ghastly rogue regime de facto ruled by communist monarch Kim Jong-Il, who norminally keeps his father's corpse as head of state.  Becker's clear writing explains and describes this horrific necrocracy in depressing detail.<br /><br />I followed North Korea for many years with the State Department and I can verify that Becker's information seems accurate and his sources seem excellent.<br /><br />This book's only failing comes when Becker tries to prognosticate North Korea's future actions and prescribe proscriptive solutions to the \\"looming threat.\\"  Not that there is no threat, but Becker is only partially appreciative of the DPRK mindset and also is no expert on international policy.  The sad truth is that there may be NO 'solution' to the problem of North Korea's WMD and erratic intentions.  But Becker does get kudos for a clean dissemination of the alternatives and the realities of the situation.<br /><br />'Rogue Regime'is a must read for it's excellent descriptions of the 'Juche Paradise' and it's loopy leader, the self-proclaimed 'greatest genius of humankind.'

Father Gillquist also writes a fairly decent apology for Orthodoxy along with basic catechismal elements.  I enjoyed the 'pilgrim's progress' and the theology of 'Peter's Church' but it was too bad that they were under the same cover and title with the later interposed between halves of the former.<br /><br />Gillquist's journey is engaging enough to stand on it's own and ought to be a separate book under the current title.  His apologetics and theology ought to be a supplemental volume.  He is a brilliant and learned man and could easily refute some of the criticisms leveled by various revewers if he focused on a broader and deeper apologetic.<br /><br />So, the two-in-one about the Three-in-One all-Holy Trinity falls a little short.  It's still worth reading because the good Father has a good command of prose and his story is very engaging.  But for a catechism or apologetic, Clark Carlton's \\"the Faith\\" or Bishop Kallistos Ware's \\"The Orthodox Way\\" are somewhat better.<br /><br />And an aside to all the reviewers--some of you are very nasty, scornful and judgemental.

Many have described it as \\"America's best-kept secret.\\"  If so, then this book, still in print after 40 years and becoming a real classic, is perhaps the decoder for that secret.  Clearly written by an Oxford Don, the book falls into two halves-- a short history of the eastern Church and a modest recapitulation of Orthodox doctrine.  Both parts are worth reading, but you could read either half alone!<br /><br />One star off the top because when the book was written, the USSR was ascendant and Orthodoxy in Russia was close to its nadir.  Despite a quick update some years back, the old grudge against the godless regime still echoes a bit too strongly.<br /><br />Despite this, \\"The Orthodox Church\\" is a fabulous overview and worth reading, whether you are seeking or not.  Maybe you are an Inquirer and like Prince Vladimir are a \\"merchant in search of fine pearls.\\"  Maybe you also will \\"send servants to Constantinople for the Orthodox Faith\\" and \\"find Christ the Priceless Pearl.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, maybe you are just interested in studying a bit about Orthodox history and doctrine.  Either way, it's hard to beat this book.<br /><br />And, reviewers from outside the Orthodox Faith should please remember that the Orthodox Way is to love one another as we love God and that we should respect and love each and every person as a unique and loved creation of God.

I avoided it like the plague until I saw several steller reviews.  You can  discern the contents in the fine Library Journal and other reveiws here, as well as some text experts, so I have not recapitulated!  The author ranges across a wide variety of topics--the comparison of higher abortion rates and lower crime rates decades later is morbidly sobering, for instance.<br /><br />What makes this book special is that Levitt uses a no-nonsense application not so much of economics but of good statistical science.  The modern world is woefully short of education on the scientific method and statistical inference.  The result is a slew of crackpot theories and unfounded assertions that circulate as \\"news,\\" abetted by incompetent and unscientific journalists.<br /><br />Levitt uses math and straitforward economics to debunk many myths and fallacious theories and shine light on the truth.  He does so in a readable, energetic, and coherent fashion.  Even if you don't know that \\"replication equals reliability\\" or that \\"correlation doesn't imply causality\\" you will love his work.<br /><br />This is a fresh look at the world, but it isn't a \\"romp\\" or a lot of half-science.  It's well-grounded and eminently readable!	2005-05-18
US	51223456	R3GQYDLTUNQAG4	0060652926	338167986	Mere Christianity	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Enlightened and Inspired	Perhaps an even better title for this CS Lewis masterpiece might be \\"Why Christianity?\\"  In this slim volume, Lewis uses a chatty, accessible style to answer questions and explain his faith.  The result is one of the best Christian apologetics ever.  Less dense and dated that \\"The Pilgrim's Regress\\" and more broad than \\"The Great Divorce,\\" this may be Lewis' finest work--which is truly saying something.<br /><br />Not to give away too much of the content, but a favorite section is when Lewis discusses psychology and philosophy.  As a Christian, Lewis gives one of the finest explanations for why we should not judge others; that we can only see their actions, not their inactions, and that we do not know others' genetics and life history.  Only God does, so only he should judge.  God may value someone who has had a cruel life merely refraining from an act of cruelty more highly that He values someone with an easy life performing a positive kindness!<br /><br />Lewis goes on to point out that those given great gifts are called on to use them more in service to mankind.  Rather like the old Kennedy adage that to whom much is given, much is asked.<br /><br />Lewis is much more accessible that contemporary English Christian authors Charles Williams or Dorothy Sayer.  Perhaps the only other modest-sized 20th century apologetic as sublime is Bishop Kallistos Ware's \\"The Orthodox Way.\\"  Both share the simple brilliance of addressing the common beliefs of all Christians from ancient times, rather than trying to be sectarian or trendy.<br /><br />Whether you are a new Christian seeking answers, someone not yet accepting Christ but curious, or even an experienced Christian, this book will be a comfort and a source of much information.<br /><br />It might not be an exaggeration to say that if you only read one book for the rest of your life, excluding scripture, this should be it!	2005-05-10

What's sillier and even more fun than the action-adventure movie \\"Sahara?\\"  The original Clive Cussler novel, of course.<br /><br />The plot is over-the-top adventure as Cussler's perrenial alter ego, Dirk Pitt battles evil polluters and saves the world; this time from a toxic waste facility in--the Sahara Desert, duh!<br /><br />Cussler has his usual themes including improbably preserved classic cars and subtle alterations of history.  Meanwhile, his fictitious National Underwater and Marine Agency is out there watching the ecology and keeping an eye peeled for buried treasure.<br /><br />There are lots of great chases, quirky characters, and twists and turns.  Cussler's prose never bogs down.  If you like a potboiler, this may be literally closer it than any other book!<br /><br />Read, enjoy, have fun! You don't have to read all the Dirk Pitt novels to enjoy just this one!<br /><br />And no, this book is unrelated to the eponymous Humphrey Bogart movie!	2005-04-27

It is very scripturally-based and the author does a good job of weaving his own story into the discourse.  My wife, raised Freewill Baptist, found this book so stimulating that she devoured it in a few hours and had us off to Vespers at an Orthodox church within 2 days!<br /><br />The Way's main failing point is that Carlton starts out nasty.  Maybe, as a former Baptist preacher himself, he felt that was necessary to get our attention.  But it is worth slogging past the first half-chapter and getting into his discussion.  Several reviewers have dismised the volume because, well, they missed the point.<br /><br />Carlton's big point is that Protestants broke from Rome and ostensibly sought to restore the original church of the apostles, but didn't even come close, and, in fact, that Church was there all along in eastern Orthodoxy.  He documents this with records dating to 70AD!<br /><br />Carlton's subsidiary point is that the reason for Protestant failure was that Calvin, Luther, etc. were actually strong individualists with preconceived notions and that Protestants have genrally followed their error of trying to make the church fit them, rather than the other way.<br /><br />Carlton spends much time on the sola scriptura argument.  While there is much to be said both ways, he does a good, meaty summary of the Orthodox position on the relationship and origins of Holy Scripture and Apostolic Tradition.  Absent, unfortunately, is a good chapter on Sola Fide; as one Orthodox priest recently told me, \\"You Protestants and Catholics think it has to be either-or on everything.\\"<br /><br />So, yes, buy this book.  It isn't perfect but it's an excellent, thought-provoking read.	2005-04-11

Both are as ascerbic as ever, and the cases are as much fun as ever.  Rumpole had a heart attack in the end of the last book, \\"Rumpole Rests His Case,\\" but he remains utterly unreformed, still sucking in cheroots and sneaking out to the Tasty Bite for greasy British breakfasts.  He escapes from convalescent care in the first story and goes on to defend a combination of the high and the low, all the while skewering obnoxious judges and all the PC hoakum that sneaks into chambers.  In short, all the usual.<br /><br />Mortimer has every bit of his art in this volume.  You have to love lines about a \\"chemical haze of aftershave,\\" for instance.  And Rumpole finds a surprising new ally in chambers.  Meanwhile there are atavistic similarities to Dickens to enliven the stock appearances of the Timsons.<br /><br />We hope there will be more Rumpole in the future, but alas there have been a few years sans a new volume.  So savor this one!	2005-02-23

Bishop Ware has produced a superb small volume on faith, doctrine, theology, and spirituality in \\"The Orthodox Way.\\"  Organized almost like an Eastern catechism, the volume unfolds through chapters about God, His world, and His most-beloved creature: man.  Starting with 'God as Mystery,' Bishop Ware begins to clearly and concisely explain how an ineffible Deity can also be our friend, how we can understand and yet not understand the Trinity, and how all of creation--even evil and free will--is a manifestation of God's love.<br /><br />If you read just one book of theology in your life, this might need to be it.  It is, in the very real sense, a revelation for Christians, and a call to those still seeking.<br /><br />Deep theologians will find this volume too much of an overview.  It doesn't have 500 pages on the history of the filoque clause or the relationship between Eastern monasticism and modern materialism.  But Ware does reference a surprising variety of sources.  You'd expect the Sayings of the Desert Fathers or quotes from St. Simeon the New Theologian in a book with this title.

Not the least being a superficial resemblance between Turtledove's near-endless series and the old 60's sitcom \\"IT's About Time.\\"<br /><br />Finally, Harry T. has decided to wrap up this series after a multi-year hiatus.  He has avoided many of the mistakes of previous books.  There are dramatic plot turns and a nice brisk pace, and a lot of barnacular accetions among the old cast have been allowed to die off.  Homeward Bound takes us to the homeworld of 'The Race' and finally re-invigorates a tired series.  For instance, the plot moves forward twenty years in twenty pages at the beginning.<br /><br />This is a better-written volume than some in the series and a must for anyone who has gotten this far.  Several readers have hoped for a sequel.  Maybe, and maybe Turtledove should just put this series to bed, as he has many other efforts underway.<br /><br />In general, Turtledove has been evolving into a better writer these last two or three years.  Inconsistently, true, but generally on the path of snappier dialog and better pacing.  But sorry, he has a long way to go to become the \\"Master of Alternate History\\" (go read Phillip Roth's \\"The Plot Against America\\" to see what a literary genius can do with the genre!).	2005-01-12

After a long hiatus, John Mortimer brings back the venerable Horace Rumpole, everyone's favourite (he deserves an English spelling) crochety, cheroot-chomping lawyer.  For fans of the series, She Who Must Be Obeyed, FIG Newton, the Timsons, and Chateu Thames Embankment are all back.  And as ever, in this collection of cases, Rumpole does not always  emerge victorious.<br /><br />This batch of cases is wonderfully up to date.  Rumpole deals with smoking bans and defends Afghan refugees and pot-toking right wing hypocrites.

If you stopped reading Philip Roth somewhere after Portnoy's Complaint, it is time to pick up the great novelist once more.  In The Plot Against America, Roth rises above his sexual obsessions, oedipal conflicts, and all the other quirks that fueled most readers' Freudian love-hate relationship with him.  Here we have a truly great novel, an alternate history carefully crafted and eminently plausible.<br /><br />Some readers will like the broad brush of the alternate world--Lindberg as president and creeping American fascism.  Others will find the detail of life utterly accurate (and it should be as the book is heavily autobiographic) and enjoy touches like Roth's brother coming back from re-education as red-white-and-blue as Yankee Doodle himself.<br /><br />Roth always had this great novel inside him; the command of language, the sense of time and place, the realistic dialoge--they were always there.  Now he's added a plot that will appeal to fans of the alternate history genre and many others outside the normal legion that have followed him.  In other words, almost any serious fiction reader will enjoy this book; you don't have to be a member of the Few Fans of Freud or a guy reminiscing about his adolescent sexual development.<br /><br />Alternate history mavens like Harry Turtledove could learn lessons from Roth about compactness of plot and about being realistic.  Any reader too young to remember how virulent American anti-semitism was in the 1940's can use our hosts here at Amazon to order the classic film \\"Gentlemen's Agreement,\\" and see for himself!<br /><br />But first, go buy this and read it.

After all, isn't it innately appealing to believe that you are a rational being, unswayed by genetics or any stimulus-response conditioning.  Isn't it great to think that your abilities will propell you to the top?  Isn't it nice to think you are the master of your fate and captain of your soul.  If you are that simple and naive, if you don't believe in God, in turning aside to help others, or in putting anything ahead of your personal gain, why, you'll just love Atlas Shrugged. But first go find someone fifty years old who still believes this stuff.  You won't, unless they've led an incredibly cosseted, lucky, and sheltered life.<br /><br />If you are into 'objectivism' (rand's philosophy), maybe it will be the cardboard cutout villains with silly names (Cuffy Meigs or Kip Chalmers, for example)that will appeal to you, or just their sheer rottenness.  On the other hand, maybe you'll just love heroes like the copper magnate inspired by a tango dancer that Ayn Rand had a fling with.  Maybe you'll just adore all the good guys chain smoking and uttering philisophical treatises.<br /><br />Ayn's superhuman humans never waver.  The only question for the good guys in Atlas Shrugged (aside from \\"Who is John Galt,\\" of course)is whether they should chuck aside their life's work on principle and teach the world a lesson by denying it the fruits of their vast intellects.  And, of course, they all reach the same answer, except for poor Eddie Willers.  But none of the heros is ever riven by a doubt like 'should I go to church' or 'would it be so awful if I gave my old shoes to the Salvation Army or put a dime in Santa's kettle.'  They all know that they will be supporting hordes of ungrateful 'looters' if they do, and will end up on a slippery slope, on the low road to Libertarian Hell in high gear!<br /><br />As with all of Ayn Rand's corpus, sound economic theory is horribly disfigured by bad philosophy.  Epic novels are hurt by thin, cheaply ironic dialogue. Rand also chooses to write about things she knows nothing about (steelmaking, running railroads, auto manufacture, international finance), which makes the plot all the more silly.<br /><br />Somehow, this massive tome has become a classic, and it probably needs to be read by most bright people, because it keeps coming up in discussions.  For all it's flaws, it still flows well and is fairly readable.  So, if you gotta do it, you gotta do it; go buy a copy and get it over with.<br /><br />By the way, the realistic character and the real hero of this novel OUGHT to be poor Eddie Willers, the loyal, hardworking, problem-solving employee.dialogue.

It needs to be read for continuity, but devotees of Aubrey should temper their expectations.  The book is slow, very slow, with the plot congealing at a fraction of the pace set by Preserved Killick's various pudding monstrosities.<br /><br />The professional reviewers paid so little attention that they got the chronology and places wrong (the main action is in Hawaii, not Tonga).  They, as I, probably found themselves nodding at the pages and pages devoted to Clarissa Oakes, a stow-away, and her inexplicable (except perhaps due to the desperation of enforced shipboard celibacy) charm.  Why Aubrey or Maturin would be genuinely interested in such a creature is about the only mystery in this volume.<br /><br />Oh, you have to read it to keep up with the series.  But the characters have been away from Sir Joseph, England, and real combat for way too long, with too many loose ends.  About halfway through this book I was taken with the conviction that the Surprise had become Die Fliegende Hollander and was doomed to sail around Australasia forever.	2004-12-01

John Eldredge does:  God looks and acts like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, and you should, too, at least if you have an XY chromosome combination.  The Almighty enjoys smiting his enemies, punching out bullies, and camping, and you should, too!  The Almighty wants you to be macho, guys!  Never grow up.  Keep being the kid in the cowboy suit!<br /><br />Eldredge bases this simplistic message on history-via-Hollywood, out-of-context quotes from literature, and very, very short bits of scripture.  The book is vapid and scripturally unsound.<br /><br />The author does have a point in noting that many aspects of church life have gotten too touchy-feely and politically correct, and that this is driving men to boredom--or just driving them away from Christ.  However, this problem does not originate in the modetrn Christian church; it's a function of secular humanism and social trends that encourage men to be \\"sensitive.\\"<br /><br />It's hard to disagree with Eldredge's assertion that real men should act like men, but his proposals for family life and reforming society are just as vapid and silly as some of the spit-swapping encounter groups he objects to.	2004-10-05

Each chapter is fairly short, and the chunks of history make for great \\"alternate history speculation\\" by scholars.  However, this book is not fiction.  It is also not serious history, as there is a lot more behind each story than Forstchen presents (for instance, \\"Big Guns\\" doesn't really point out that the Byzantine Empire was already doomed by a shrinking tax base, the sweeping tide of Islam, and the harm done to the Eastern Empire by the Latinate Dictatorship, the Crusades, etc.).<br /><br />For serious history, with a readable, well-researched look at REALLY big blunders, the reader might want to move on to Barbara Tuchmann's \\"The March of Folly,\\" a true classic.  For alternate history, Forstchen's own novels are as good an entry point to the genre as any.<br /><br />It Seemed Like a Good Idea is a hybrid and is sort of in limbo, but is well-written and engageing nonetheless.  It's main failing is that it uses 20-20 hindsight and information not available to decision-makers at the time to cast them as idiots.  Otherwise, it's a fine read, informative, and well worth your time.	2004-08-31

Author Harry Turtledove must have read some of the criticism levied against earlier books in the series before turning \\"Return Engagement\\" over to his editiors, for the latest book in this long semi-series is the best in some time.  To begin with, something momentous happens right away instead of just in the last fifty pages of the book:  World War Two breaks out.<br /><br />The characters on stage this time are also flexible, and less repetitive.  Abner Dowling doesn't have to eat large meals at every appearance for instance.  And a welcome trend, started in the last book, is keeping the plotline fresh by allowing some characters to expire or be killed while shifting the viewpoint to a relative.  The plot moves right along, And so will readers, enjoying a large and gripping volume.<br /><br />The book isn't perfect.  It's slow in patches.  Readers will wonder why Jefferson Pinkard is taking forever to come up with the inevitable mass extermination technique after 500 pages, or how many times they will have to follow Scipio on his way to and from work at the Huntsman's Lodge.  But Turtledove does move faster this time and often lifts his loyal fans above the momentary scenes so they can see the big picture of his alternate history on a regular basis.  He has also chunked this long series into trilogies, adding organization and an end point.<br /><br />Those readers having come this far will definitely want this volume and will eagerly anticipate the next one!	2004-08-23

His tales are fast-paced, logically consistent, and full of well-developed, sympathetic characters.  \\"Dies the Fire\\" is no exception.  It's a worthy \\"flip side\\" to \\"Island in the Sea of Time.\\"  The twist here comes when an electrical storm over Nantucket acts like both an EMP and a gunpowder-suppression agent.  No more electricity or firearms, ever.  Is it the wrath of God, the work of aliens, or a natural phenomenon?  Whatever it is, humanity struggles to survive.<br /><br />Instead of filling his pages with characters tortured with existential angst or a continuing inability to accept, \\"the change,\\" Stirling focuses in on Mike Havel, an Idaho bush pilot, and Juniper, an Oregon neo-pagan, as they become not-too-unlikely leaders of little bands of survivors.<br /><br />Stirling's little homages to other classics in this genre, from \\"Lord Kalvan\\" to \\"1632\\" are always fun, and the man's knowledge of history, weapons and combat are always a formidable asset.  He has also well-researched the terrain and climate he writes about.<br /><br />If there is any criticism of Dies the Fire, it is that the coefficient of characters with handy post-change skills like farmers, bow makers, smiths, and coopers seems extraordinarily convenient.  Also, most readers could do without all the Wiccan hoodoo-voodoo claptrap.<br /><br />However, the story is so well-paced and realistic, and the writing so crisp and effective, that you just have to overlook these little faults.	2004-08-09

This review is for those who watched the &quot;master and Commander&quot; movie and are now contemplating reading the series.<br />The caveats are that it is a long series of books (20) and that the pace is much slower than Hollywood's.  That said, if you have any interest in the times (The Napoleonic Wars) and the topic (sailing, naval warfare), you will certainly want to set sail with Patrick O'Brien.  In &quot;master and Commander,&quot; you will find almost no overlap with the eponymous film, except that the principal characters are Captain Aubrey and Dr. Maturin, and much revolves around their relationship.<br />Indeed, personalities and relationships are one of the strong suits of these books, which have rich and evolving character development.  Start here, read through a few, and by the time you are several books in, half the Royal Navy will be old friends, or adversaries.

If you have been reading the saga of Grantville, WV transported back to the Thirty Years War, you will already have read 1632 and 1633.  You may not have yet read &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; a supplemental collection of short stories.  Do so before you pick up &quot;1634: The Galileo Affair.&quot;  Many of the characters and plot lines in the new book depend on amplifications and stories from &quot;Ring of Fire.&quot;<br />You will enjoy seeing some favorite uptime and downtime characters further developed, especially Tom Stoner and Sharon Nichols.  You will, again, get a palpable sense of being there, for the book is well written and meticulously detailed.<br />1634 is also less miltiary-oriented than 1633, and, perhaps blessedly, has fewer competing plotlines.  However, it is a shame that some of the themes and plotlines from 1633 were not wrapped up.  If there are any weaknesses to the new volume, they are, first, that it is like a shotgun blast, scattering wider as time goes on, and, second, that the downtime characters seem too twentieth-century.  People are people, but folk were by all accounts, a lot more unreasonable, smelly, and brutish in 1634 than they are portrayed here.<br />That said, the book is a fun romp and you won't be able to put it down.

As an active Methodist, a devotee of John Wesley, and a reader of many tomes on this denomination, I found this book poor on almost every score.  You won't get to know any great Methodists well from this book.  You also won't learn much about Methodist doctrine.<br />You will get a watered-down, highly liberal slant on what the United Methodist Church is up to today, with a little skewed history tossed in.  If that's what you want, order it.  If you want to find out about Wesley, order a biography or his own writings instead.  If you want to learn about Methodist Doctrine, read the nice little volume of that title by Campbell.	2004-04-14

It begins with an interesting murder and quickly evolves into a Quest for the Holy Grail,thus assuming that Those Feet in ancient times, did indeed wander England's mountains green.  Along the way, an unlikely triumverate (or should we say Trinity) of good guys battles some very sinister fellows.  Touches of humor grace the book, and the theology and the message are sound and inspiring.<br />Williams was one of a trio of great early 20th century Christian authors, in a little club (The Inklings) with fellow dons C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.  Today, Tolkien is most remembered for fiction, and Clive Staples Lewis for theology.  This is, in part, because Williams wrote in a more formidable style.  However, once you get into the syntax and rythym, his words flow smoothly and he is very readable.  Press on through the first few pages of any Williams book, and you will be rewarded with a &quot;ripping yarn&quot; on many levels.<br />This book is recommended not only for those who love Williams' other fiction (Descent into Hell, Place of the Lion, etc.) and nonfiction (Descent of the Dove), but for anyone who would enjoy a serious Christian adventure novel.<br />There is a strong message of the role of faith, and of eccumenical Christianity in &quot;War in Heaven.&quot;  Maybe it isn't for sticklers on one denomination's doctrine, but for most, it is well worth ordering.	2004-04-09

I'm sorry to feel obliged to write a 'downside' review of what is actually a well-written and gripping novel by two fairly good authors.  But we have to face the fact that the \\"alternate civil war-the South wins\\" topic is so overdone that you can fill a library shelf with this genre.  Lee wins at Gettysburg?  Haven't we all been there, done that, and got the t-shirt?  Another book making out the Union to be a pack of villains and heaping hagiography on Bobby Lee? I can see all the negative votes for this review piling up from you guys south of the Mason-Dixon line, but this theme's been chosen already.  It has to be said: the alternate civil war genre has been done to death.  \\"Guns of the South,\\" \\"Stars and Stripes Forever,\\" \\"A Rebel in Time\\" or \\"Alternate Generals,\\" all jump to mind but there have to have been a dozen other less-memorable titles at least.<br />One more thing needs to be said.  Forstchen and Gingrich are good writers.  I've read many of their books.  But let's not forget that they've both started some alternate history series and then let them die, stranding readers (\\"Down to the Sea\\" or \\"1945\\" ring a bell, anyone?).  We can hope that won't happen here and maybe if you go out and buy enough copies of this it won't.  Since anything that smacks of the civil war sells like hotcakes, one wonders if that wasn't why the authors chose this topic.<br />All that cynicism and fretting about cliches aside, this is, in the end analysis, a good read, well-crafted and with a good knowledge of the real history of the time.  If you just have to read yet another alternate civil war book, it might as well be this one.	2004-03-18

If so, she can rest proudly on a heap of laurels.  This clear, concise, and articulate volume is a wonderful stand-alone look at the world today.  It is a fine analysis of the motivations behind the policies of many nation states.  The author mixes her own copious experience on the world political stage with a fine knowledge of history.  Although the book is well-referenced and might make a good textbook, it does not attempt the breadth and depth of Kissenger's tome &quot;Diplomacy.&quot;<br />This book is accurate and relatively up-to-date, as Lady Thatcher took pains to do a final, post 9/11, re-write.  Anyone looking at the cold war or the modern world from a foreign policy perspective will find her writing invaluable.  For everyone else, it is merely a great read and highly informative!  I worked for the State Department during much of the period covered by Lady Thatcher and can confirm the accuracy of many of her assertions.<br />Foreign Policy wonks may get off on the muddled, minutiae-obsessed, and frequently-wrong articles in &quot;Foreign Policy.&quot;  Liberals and the gang from PC-ville may blanche at Lady Thatcher's frank assessments of the world, her quasi-hagiography of Ronald Reagan, or her damning comments about many recent world leaders, such as Gorbachev.  But don't think she tars all liberals and moderates with her negative brush; she has many good things to say about Tony Blair, for instance.  Most readers will delight in her prose and her refreshingly candid worldview!  Buy it!	2004-02-23

He also doesn't understand that foreign policy is not made at the State Department (it is made at the NSC and has been since FDR's 3rd term).  Further, he seems to want to indict the Foreign Service without having really spoken to any members.  He also doesn't seem quite able to grasp that the State department neither makes nor administers US military relationships.  He also just doesn't seem on top of simple truths like &quot;the job of diplomats is not to provoke wars.&quot;<br />All those indictments aside, he does have some very valid points.  The DOS does give out visas too easily, or at least it did before 9-11.  The Consular Affairs bureau is NOT vigorous enough in helping US citizens abroad.  And the Foreign Service is rife with apologists, collaborators, wimps, and egomaniacal sycophants, as he alleges.  I know:  I was a Foreign Service Officer for ten years!<br />Don't expect anything &quot;fair and balanced&quot; in Joel's little screed here.  But there are certainly some things to get you thinking and it might be worth reading this along with some views from the other side of the spectrum.	2004-02-06

But DO expect a nice, clean, concise history of the Methodist denomination, a good explanation of its eccumenicalism, a summary of Wesley's values, and all the promised essentials about what role communion, baptism, and clerical orders play in the modern UMC. The end of the book has a tidy summation of Wesley's \\"rules\\" and the general principles of the UMC.<br /><br />For anyone thinking of joining a Methodist church, seeking information about Methodism, and for those Methodists who want a good, concise reference and explanation, this is THE book.

Lewis was perhaps the finest writer of Christian theology in the 20th century, had a brilliant command of his language, or gave more lucid insights in a few pages than most authors do in their entire life's work.  Hardly original, but still true.  &quot;The Pilgrim's Regress&quot; is a fine example, albeit a somewhat pithier and less penetrable one than, say, &quot;the Great Divorce&quot; or &quot;The Screwtape Letters.&quot;<br />In &quot;Regress,&quot; Lewis does a tangent on the classic Bunyan work, &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot; and uses the same dream device to present us with a soul's journey through a strange yet strangely familiar country.  Lewis' pilgrim, John, encounters the demons and temptations of the early twentieth century:  there are Mr. Enlightenment, Sigismund (Freud, of course), and the devotees of fascism and dada-ism, as well as the expected temptations of compromise and lust.<br />Much of the allegory will be obvious to the reader.  There is little doubt who &quot;Mother Kirk,&quot; &quot;The Landlord,&quot; or &quot;The Stewards&quot; are.  However, to &quot;get it all&quot; you'll either need a few Ph.D's and a good grounding in what a 1930-ish British intellectual knew, be one of those maddeningly brilliant people who &quot;gets it,&quot; when he reads Umberto Ecco novels, or, preferably just wise enough to buy the annotated edition.<br />Through it all, the &quot;Regress&quot; reader will be moved and surprised.  This is a key book for any student of Lewis, thoughtful Christian, or even a student of general philosophy.  Ifv you are looking for some serious reading and deep insight into yourself, by all means go read this!	2004-01-19

However, he has strayed into new territory with &quot;Intelligence and War,&quot; in which he puts forward a simplistic thesis that intelligence is of little or no value to battlefield commanders.  The literal legion of such commanders who disagree should be enough to disprove the hypothesis.  If not, Keegan's somewhat loose definition of 'intelligence' makes it hard to test the hypothesis one way or the other.<br />Keegan is a great writer and has an impressive command of the facts.  But one closes the book saying, &quot;huh?  and?  really?&quot; rather than agreeing.<br />I know from experience as a former Foreign Service Officer, that there is a big difference between 'intelligence' and 'news.'  I also know that most of the success stories that come from applying intelligence to a field situation can never be made public.  Alas, that's Keegan's connundrum.  He has put forward an assertion that cannot be publically refuted because most of the information that would do so is classified.<br />He should have known that!<br />In short, this is a well-written book with some interesting history, but with a fundamentally flawed hypothesis.  Up to you if you want to read it anyway!	2004-01-15

The next full novel (presumably 1634) will be out soon and &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; provides character development, plot details, and timeline descriptions that will be valuable.  Stories in this new collection date from the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; incident right up to &quot;1633&quot; an involve many of the same characters.<br />Despite the wide variety of authors, the tales hold together well, with a real sense of place and time.  Not all the stories will appeal to everyone.  Some are more militaristic, others are social or romantic in nature.  &quot;A Lineman for the Country&quot; gave real depth and progression to the timeline while similar odd-couple romance &quot;Power to the People&quot; left me saying &quot;yeah, and?&quot;<br />Overall, this is a must-read, and could be read right after &quot;1632&quot; w/o first facing the more fractured, slow-paced, and overly military/technical aspects of &quot;1633.&quot;  In fact, these downsides to &quot;1633&quot; will be lessened quite a bit by the character development and background details in &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; so why are you waiting?

Although some family members achieve material success, they all are essentially unhappy, and never realize that this is because they have no faith in God.<br />Updike has a fine command of history and theology to compliment his mastery of English prose.  The minister's story is a deliberate antithesis to Jacobus Arminius, a theologian at the University of Geneva in the late 1500's.  Arminius was studying non-Calvinist writings in order to bolster Presbyterianism.  Instead, he ended up being swayed.  Today, we call denominations that believe in the ecumenical nature of salvation 'arminian.'  Updike's minister is a Presbyterian who studies athiest tracts to refute them and ends up instead renouncing a faith which at the time was well-known as the \\"frozen chosen.\\"  Updike chronicles the family's journey through four generations and ends with a strange renewal of faith.  Updike, deliberately, puts aside the sarcasm and humor that he wields so well in \\"A Month of Sundays\\" and \\"The Coup.\\"  What remains is one of the best novels of the late 20th century, a serious work on faith and American society.	2003-11-26

Marc Simmons is also more than a little credulous, recounting hand-me-down fifth-generation tales as if they were real reports of sorcery. He does make a decent stab at explaining the synthesis of native witchcraft with that brought by some Spanish settlers to New Mexico.<br />Alas, this book is nearly a quarter-century out of date and has no information about the resurgence of pagan practices and 'new age' movements in the region.  Those looking for a book titled \\"Travelers' Yarns About Witchcraft in Old New Mexico\\" might find this book of value.  Serious researchers or readers with organized minds will be disappointed.<br />To give this slim volume credit, there is some good history of Pueblo witchcraft trials and some of the anecdotes come with neat bits of trivia (know where the color 'Santa Fe blue' comes from, for instance?<br />But speaking as a resident of the focus area, and the next-door-neighbor to a coven of witches, I have to say that the book was disappointing in several ways.	2003-10-28

That in no way makes his fiction any less profound, well-crafted, or poignant.  His best work, The Place of the Lion, is a sort of Gnostic horror fiction with deep theological implications.  Descent into Hell is a more straightforward look at a professional man who sets himself on the low road in high gear with a small intellectual compromise precipitated by vanity.  As his descent progresses, he is given many chances to step aside from the path of narcissism and pride which becomes his ruin.  Meanwhile, those around him choose harder but more rewarding routes.<br />One of the 20th century's most important works of Christian fiction, Descent into Hell is just superb.  It will have even the deepest-thinking or most cynical reader stimulated and bemused.<br />Such books do not always stay in print and they also are potentially important for the course of our lives.  For both reasons, I say &quot;Buy it before it's too late!&quot;	2003-09-04

I've been a big fan of Harry Turtledove and of this series for many years; too many in fact.  I would like to see the conclusion to this series before I am an old age pensioner.  The Victorious Opposition was a bit less drawn out than some previous installments but still too slow.  Both the novel and the author suffer from scattering their efforts.  The series would move faster with fewer characters and Turtledove would manage better than a book per year if he wasn't writing several other serieis at the same time.  For the sake of seeing a conclusion before Haley's Comet returns, or possibly the Second Coming, we can only hope that Mr. Turtledove focuses a little and doesn't continue on with the saga of every spouse and offspring when he blessedly kills off some of the more boring characters.<br />All that said, The Victorious Opposition is a good book and throws some intriguing curves.  Readers of the series will devour it in a day or two.  Unfortunately, this means that they will be sitting around bored for 363 days waiting for the next installment.

Harry Harrison may have bitten off more than he could chew, technologically, for the military innovations were fairly limited.  I know I was waiting for the submarine that never surfaced.  While it was satisfying to see the histrionic and arrogant British aristocracy get their decidedly un-Ambersonlike comeuppance, it was oh-so-expected.<br />The book suffered from failure to further develop (or even use) most of the main characters from the previous two books. New characters also could have used a quick personality and body-building session, especially Gladstone and Disraeli.<br />The book was disappointingly short; there was plenty of room for all that was lacking.<br />Fans of the series will need to read the book, just for closure's sake.  But wait for the paperback.	2003-01-15
