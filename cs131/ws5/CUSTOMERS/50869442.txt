This book starts off like a classic adventure in the desert -  `Raiders of The Lost Ark' or `King Solomon's Mines'.  But Higgins phones this one in;  that is, what starts as a geo-political romp with Nazis chasing lost  treasures is quickly turned he-man superman heroics.  Charcaters (i.e.  Muller) are inconsistent and unrecognizable; the dialogue pulp and stilted  as a B action movie; the action unbelievable and the ending a yawner.  I  wanted a Good adventure, which Higgins has provided me over many novels,  but I got junk. Very disappointing!	2000-08-19

I hoped I would be surprised but I wasn't. In short, this novel let me down in the end.  Anyone who has seen the movie  `Stalingrad' cannot but be disappointed in this effort.  Must war novels of  this kind maintain the stilted morality of the victors?  I mean the  American Woman character (another addition of women characters botched by  male authors) and the amicable relations between communist party  functionaries and front line soldiers was almost laughable. Most soldiers  were caught between the Gulag and the Germans for most of the war and  after.  This kind of glossy politics and history is forgivable (I mean this  is no `Gulag Archipelago' or `Tin Drum') for most of the novel because  Robbins does build up the  `High Noon' dramatics with masterful sniper  detail and suspense. But in the end, it's a let down.<br />However, for all  its flaws, this novel a thriller that is a cut above the pack. If a decent  war novel is your thing, this one hits a the outer ring of the bullseye for  summer reading. And there's enough good stuff in here to make me think  about buying his next effort.	2000-08-11

Perhaps, like Kant's `Critique of Pure Reason', Heidegger's `Being and Time' is an often name-dropped text but it remains unread most of the time.  Well, if you read it, a few pointers are needed: 1. Heidegger assumes  `Being' is expressed through Dasein (there-being); 2. Dasein is constituted  by Time and Space; 3. Dasein's constitution is investigated as `ontology'  (Gr.`ontos'-existence); 4. Ontology is marking out of the ontological and  ontic structures of existence qua human Dasein; 5. `Ontological' structures  are meta-ta-physika (beyond the physical) and constitute the ontic  (physical everyday behaviours and thoughts); 6. `Ontological' constitution  of the ontic `facts of life' is an elegant description of time and  spatiality, which, unlike Kant, does not ground itself in Cognition; 7. As  Heidegger presents it in `BT', Existence as such Being qua being is  constituted by Time temporalizing itself; 8. Heidegger attempts to ground  Dasein's spatiality through time but fails, and Being and Time leaves  unsaid `Being and Spatiality'. Spatiality and its relation to Time haunts  Heidegger's later work as an unsolved enigma.	2000-07-28

I chain read, like smoke, and I was onto `The Holy Blood, The Holy Grail' (still the best one!) series of secret societies within the cabals of power, Mars mysteries, secret histories and texts, Jesus Christ's family  tree and establishment cover-ups. I was beginning to find that these  secrets were very well covered and highly profitable.  Were they secrets at  all? Or is the conspiracy that the only conspiracy is that of chance,  accident, belief and interpretation - the contingency of life? The notion  of real figures working behind the scenes (Mike Myer's `Dr. Evil) to dupe  us all from the truth (which we cannot handle apparently!) is the real  conspiracy or wishful thinking that anyone or anything has any real control  of this world. This is the real `power' of the occult and its danger; that  is, making others believe in your power to control life does indeed give  you power. Apparently, the facists knew all to well of this oldest of all  confidence games. But was there something to it? A double paradox that the  surface theories only covered, that deeper more would be revealed - the  mystery itself becomes the vanishing point of creation and destruction that  initiates call upon within themselves: &quot;... it's a geometric point;  you can't see it because it has no dimension, it can't move, it doesn't  rotate with the earth ... There is no `itself.' The Earth turns, but the  point doesn't. That's how it is. ... I guess it's the Pendulum's  business.&quot;  <br /> &quot;The greatest lie the devil ever told was that  there is no devil.&quot;     <br />Through the infinite regression paradox and  looking glass I went.  <br />One day I picked up `Foucault's Pendulum', I had  read and deeply enjoyed `The Name of the Rose', and began reading.   Although I had the background in this stuff, I still found it tough going;  but Eco's `Mystery of the Mystery within the mystery' began to enchant.  Eco's torrent of theories, text chases, rants on Templars, numerology, the  Holy Grail, myterious figures, magic and the like constitute the Sam Spade  like tone of the Narration Casaubon.  But this `Maltese Falcon' is interior  to the soul and alchemical.	2000-07-28

An overlooked classic!	I spent many a long hour reading philosophy on the nature of property, possession and place.  Also, I have spent many an hour reading the history and politics of nations for their respective histories of territorial  aspirations.  The mystery and problems of the human connection to  particular places still eluded me.  <br />I picked up this book at a flea  market and began reading.  I learned more and gained more insight into the  nature of Nature's territorial inhabitants than all my previous reading.  Through carefully observed case studies of animals, conservative  conclusions are drawn.  Light on theory, and heavy on examples of  particular territorial behaviours of our fellow creatures, `The Territorial  Imperative' is must read for any person interested in the way of Nature and  ourselves.	2000-07-27

Tacitus' opens up a lost world before the Christians in what was, for many of us, our mother countries - Britian and Germany.  The book is divided in two; the first piece `Agricola' (farmer)is named after the father-in-law of  Tacitus.  Tacitus gives us part biography and part eulogy in order to  confer immortality on Agricola's memory at the edge of Empire among the  barbarians. Agricola was loved and honoured by Tacitus, and Tacitus gives  an account of his military and political triumphs before being called to  Rome. For anyone interested in early British history, warfare or pagan  themes observed first hand, this is a must have.<br />The second part is an  amazing series of geograpgical, religious, and general cultural  observations among the Germans. In this age of political correctness,  Tacitus' observations are a delicious treat of unfettered notation of  racial difference and character that still ring guiltily true about the  Germans (good and bad), especially in the first half of the last century.   &quot;Their holy places are the woods and groves, and they call by the name  of god that hidden presence which is seen only by the eye of  reverence.&quot; ... &quot;They count, not like us, by days, but by  nights.&quot; ... &quot;No form of approval can carry more honour than  praise expressed by arms.&quot;<br />Great stuff.

In this beautifully written little essay, Mark Kurlansky explains how the early settlement and wealth of America revolved around this fish.

Heidegger's `Introduction to Metaphysics' was banned in Germany until the early 1950s. Why? Some aspects of Heidegger's rhetoric, and certain passages, e.g., &quot;The greatness of National Socialism ... &quot;,  lended themselves to Nazism. Written in the 1930s, `An Introduction to  Metaphysics' maintains Heidegger's muddled and still unclear association  with Nazism regarding his philosophy. His membership in the party still  casts a long and many would say daming shadow over his philosophy.   However, this work is still fascinating and, when read with Nazi filters,  rewarding because in this work Heidegger introduces many of his  preoccupations that will dominate his thinking after his turn (`Kehre'),  e.g., truth, metaphysics, etc..  I studied it closely for my thesis and  what is problematic is Heidegger's equation of the `power of the polis'  with truth-Being.  Power-truth siding on the power of the state and not the  individual of liberalism is what needs attention. He moves radically away  from this in later thinking.  Heidegger is no democrat, but whether he is a  full blown Nazi is up to the reader to decide.  A must read for  philosophers and historians of the period.	2000-07-13

In order to fully comprehend the impact of Kant's 1st Critique on thought and science one must understand what Kant is up to here.  Kant is responding to the radical empiricism of Hume which leaves us with no mind  qua cognition, and radical rationalism on the other, which leaves us with  no empirical world qua Berkeley's `all mind.'  Kant's project is to put  Reason itself on trial; that is, a `critique' of `pure' reason is an  analysis of the limits of reason - what can and cannot be known.  In short  what constitutes metaphysics. Kant's conclusion is still shaking the  western world. Every philosophy, science interpretation and philosopher  since has had to (in some way) respond to Kant. Kant says we cannot make  knowledge claims about the noumena (outside of empirical experience), all  that can be known is phenomena (the empirical world). But Kant splices  empiricism with rationalism by saying Cognition constitutes that empirical  world. The `Critique of Pure Reason' is a map of the conditions that  constitute the empirical world - the a priori synthetic conditions of  `possible' experience. Possible means the description of the cognitive  machinery of any experience whatsoever of the empirical world. Kant's  description of these conditions, e.g., time, space, schematism-imagination,  and the levels of Rational management of those conditions (intuition and  imagination)make up the content of what you find in this book.  <br />Reason  operates within cognition `as if' (als ob) it makes sense of the empirical  world. Reason is a necessary fiction for knowledge claims, but its feet is  made of clay.  However, we have to recognize those limits and work within  in them because &quot;to soar beyond its limits, outside which there is for  us nothing but empty space.&quot; [CPuR, B 730]<br />This text is dense, odd  in style, and a perpetual student horror; but once mastered it gives you  the key to open philosophy and science in an authoritive way.  Remember,  existentialists, romantics, analytic logicians, mathematicians, physicists,  deconstructionists, and most anything that involves the messy mudfight of  interpretation give homage to Kant.  Kant's 1st Critique is the 1st Big  Bang of the western tradition since Plato.  Heidegger's `Being and Time' is  a footnote in comparison.<br />It's not that bad once you get going. Really!   I was terrified and got an F on my first paper, but a 95% in the course.  But it is not to be read wiithout instruction. If you take one philsophy  course, make it this one.	2000-07-13

I always thought of Pascal as a great scientist, but as a somewhat dated Christian apologist. The general treatment of Pascal by both science and humanities is at best an unreflective nod to the importance of his  scientific discoveries and a momentary and uncomfortable glance at his  `other' writings.  <br />The lack of serious consideration given to Pascal's  `other' writings by philosophy and theology departments and their absence  from science curriculums is indicative of major bias and ignorance.  Why?   <br />Pascal's science is embarassing to defenders of prevalent Darwinian  atheistic science because of his zeal for the Christian faith. Pascal made  some important discoveries but he &quot;abandoned science for  religion&quot; and for that reason is tagged as an historical anachronism -  he like many of the scientists of the 17th century were heavily tainted  with `folk belief' and superstitions.<br />Pascal's Science and Faith is  embarassing to those philosophers and theologians that cannot reconcile the  two aspects of human Pensees - thoughts. They like to think of Pascal as an  early `existentialist' like Kierkegaard who made a `leap' of faith against  the atheistic dogmas of material science; but Pascal did not support their  radical dichotomy of science versus faith. <br />Shunned on both sides for  different reasons (for centuries!), Pascal is finally becoming more and  more appreciated as someone who was `between' faith and science; a position  becoming more fashionable.  <br />All you have to do is read `The Pensees' to  quickly see it as one of the most important, beautiful and penetrating  books ever written.   The Pensees (`Thoughts') are a long series of  fragments on the the human situation, Jesus Christ, God, revelation,  Infinity and finitude. But it is the little pieces that you find, like lost  treasures, that ring through to your very being that sets Pascal's Pensees  apart as a book for living and reflecting and not merely  analyzing.<br/>&quot;We sail over a vast expanse, ever uncertain, ever  adrift, carried to and fro. To whatever point we think to fix and fasten  ourselves it shifts and leaves us; and if we pursue it it escapes our  grasp, slips away, fleeing in eternal flight - Man's condition:  inconstancy, ennui, unrest.&quot;<br />&quot;The last step that Reason takes  is to recognize that there is an infinity of things that lie beyond it.  Reason is a poor thing indeed if it does not succed in knowing that.&quot;	2000-07-11

Although a bit too `Irish' for my taste in Newfoundland  set stories, the writing is profound and the best in the english language  currently being turned out these days.  Johnson's family were smiths with  iron and his writing is the same; that is, he turns the raw iron of  language into something minimal, economical and heavy that carries the  weight and experience of generations.

Perhaps, one of the first and least interesting of Heidegger's long phenomenology books from the 1920s.

Ironically, there is little  exposition of `history' or the history of the `concept of time' in this  work.  I read this work during my thesis on Heidegger's thinking on  spatiality.  It contains some insights regarding this aspect of Heidegger's  thought, but does not add much to `Being and Time.'

I first read Kirk and Raven's `Presocratic Philosophers' as an undergrad.  I was being taught pre-socratic philosophy by a Cambridge Classical Greek philosopher.  Since then it has become one of my favourite and most  valuable philosophy texts.  Kirk and Raven present us with all the credible  `fragments' of presocratic philosophy as quoted in later philosophers.   They present the original greek and a (most times) definitive english  translation and analysis.  Although, what I learned through my professor  via Kirk and Raven is that you sift or decant yourself through these most  ancient and profound fragments - more akin to an approach to the `I Ching'  and poetry than contemporary analytic philosophy.  Kirk and Raven present  us with the `holy' text of western philosophy which never fails to produce  the wonder of thinking - a true thinking that is rare and primordial. Even  if you usually don't like reading philosophy, the presocratics are really  `post-modern' and poetic in their fragmentary and oracular collages of  meaning.  T.S. Eliot's `The Four Quartets' is soaked with pre-socratic  philosophy.<br />The Pre-socratics deserve more attention because `all', and I  mean all, of the basic philosophic and scientific positions are contained  within these seeds of the western tradition.	2000-04-04

Jacobs takes on the tech/industrial luddites who claim that `the age of technology' is an unnatural imposition currently ravaging the earth.  Our economies are natural, as natural as any other system - she inverts the  duality by making us see the city as a natural habitat and the rainforest  as an artifact.  Its all natural baby! Jacobs says, &quot;nature is  prodigal with details but parsimonious with principles.&quot; And further,  &quot;I don't know what's to be done or what's possible to do, and neither  does anyone else.&quot;  I'd add that `The Nature of Economies' is prodigal  with details and parsimonious with principles. <br />Jacobs presents the  environmental horrors of the global economy as natural, a `bio-mimicry' of  humans just being humans.  `What is to be done?' Well, economies are  natural, what can you do? A big shrug in wrapped up in brilliant and  sophisticated research and analysis. The net effect sounds like a indirect  apology for our global parasitism. A parasite is natural, and global  resource economics is parasitism; taking everything and giving back nothing  - eventually destroying the host and the organism.  Human beings and our  current economic system are `bio-mimicing' the parasite. <br />The old  philosophical saw contained in the distinction between `is' and `ought' has  no validity in Jacob's analysis because she has nowhere to put a principle  between humans and the rest of nature. In all fairness, Jacobs makes a few  pointings toward a human imagination and ingenuity to combat the increase  in environmental catastrophe, but she has no `ought' in her analysis - only  the `is' of nature naturing.  Could we or should we do otherwise? A shrug  ... we are part of nature, being as we are ... oh well sigh!<br />Maybe, its  because she lives in the center of a huge city for so long that she is  detached enough to entertain the idea that cities aren't destructive  artifacts but natural habitats.  City folk get off guilt free for their`sink hole' of drain on the artifact of nature.  City's are natural  habitats for humans, rats, roaches and pets.  <br />Read Michel Serres `The  Natural Contract' instead or before.	2000-04-02

Profound and  Rare.	Some readers complain that Eisenman's Book is too long, con-fused and not edited correctly.  I disagree.  This book clarifies, synthesizes and produces wonder at the pass of almost every sentence. Given the importance  of his huge task, Eisenman's sentences and sections are usually crisp and  minimal which only heightens the full impact of his evidence and  implications. <br />Most of what I find in `James Brother of Jesus' I have  read in bits and pieces in other extremely speculative and much less  respected works like `Holy Blood, Holy Grail', `Dead Sea Scrolls  Deception,' `The Hiram Key' and Barbara Thiering's work.  These works have  been ignored and dismissed by the Christian establishment for a long time  on the basis of weak evidence and wild leaps of imagination.  They had a  point. <br />But Eisenman's work towers over anything that has gone before it  in its breadth and depth of internal historical research. He brings the  Christian tradition, with its shadowlands of history and myth, to a  critical point with monumental power. That is, never before has the  dichotomy between the historical Jesus via James and the Myth of Jesus via  Paul been drawn so clearly, carefully and exhaustively. If you are a  `thinking Christian', as opposed to a dogmatic apologist, read this book.  The confusion in the Christian soul between the historical reality of Jesus  and the existential reality of the spirit or myth of Jesus `the Christ'  must be confronted. With `James The Brother Of Jesus' Christian Ostrich  time is over.  <br />My only argument with Eisenman is theological and  teleological.  1)Theological - by implying that the Pauline `myth' of Jesus  Christ is shattered by the revelations about the real history of James, he,  like many other iconoclasts, misses the point.  Christianity, like all  religions, is a myth that structures social relations, psychological  perception, ethics, behaviours and history itself. No more, and certainly  no less than any other religion.  The origins of Christianity's  anti-Semitism is well taken and is vitally important given the recent  revelations about `Hitler's Pope'. But there has been much Good as well in  this myth. 2) Which leads to the teleological question `Why write this? To  what end?' Is it to rub Christian noses in the cesspool of history, as if  other traditions, didn't have them? Or is it a Jack Nicholson `You Can't  Handle The Truth' kind of throwing down the gauntlet challenge to  Christians? Some of us can handle it, and have struggled with the dichotomy  between the existential myth and empirical facts of Christianity to be able  to accomodate the `twin' Jesus.<br />In sum. -  Read It!	2000-03-22

Having spent many frustrating hours looking for the substance in Derrida's many labyrinthine works, I make this suggestion to others: `Of Grammatology' is the thread text to start your wonderings through the rest of Derrida's thought.	2000-03-19
US	50869442	R3LNRDS0B2DFL5	0385316887	501876974	Siberian Light	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Thriller with depth.	White's chrarcters display the decadence, byzantine corruption and beauty of contemporary (and perhaps always) Russia. A page turner, tour of the landscape, and highly recommended winter distraction - although the ending  is a `little' bit much.  As well as a first class thriller, this novel  displays glimpses of a very promising writer.  I will buy his next book.   Keep writing Robin!	2000-03-01

Given the hype over the book, I expected much more by way of chracter depth, authentic detail of fishing vessels and the lifestyle of fishers. This book was a rare atttempt to capture all those things, and it does aim  to do so. But it falls short - the female characters especially. And it  bores.  Too bad, another good edit and rewrite and he could have had  something special. As it is, this fish floats dead to the surface and  stinks.	2000-02-22
US	50869442	R5JMWC8QHC14P	0253210674	265488820	Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, Fifth Edition, Enlarged (Studies in Continental Thought)	Books	5	30	31	N	N	The origin of Deconstruction. Read before `Being and Time'.	Intended to be part of `Being and Time', but published separately and after BT. Heidegger's intention for `Kant and The Problem of Metaphysics' is straight forward; that is, Rational-Cognitive subjectivity (as presented  in Kant's `Critique of Pure Reason') is not a tenable basis for  metaphysics. Why? Because `time' alone can provide a foundation for  metaphysics; thereby, dispensing with Reason, subjectivity and the rest of  Kant's transcendental machinery. Heidegger claims to have `found Kant out';  that is, earlier editions of Kant's Critique has time as a much more  important notion. Heidegger accuses Kant of recoiling from the primacy of  time, and goes on to demonstrate that time is the basis of any possible  metaphysics; to be carried out as a fundamental ontology via `Being and  Time'.<br />Watch out for Heidegger's own recoil regarding spatiality and its  relation to time.	2000-02-21

Duhem does us a major favour by compiling a mamouth amount of original texts that would otherwise by lost and fragmented in the vaults and basements of many very old universities.  The traditional problem with  medieval philsophy is actually finding the philosophy itself! Duhem's  breathtaking reasearch and presentation of these rare texts makes this book  an instant classic. But `Medieval Cosmology' is much more than a  compilation of texts; Duhem's clear and concise summaries and transitions  of very intricate and detailed analyses of `Place, Time and Void' makes  this book not only accessible but a pure joy of scholarship and thought.	2000-02-10

This book is one of the very, very few that gets what its like to be out there.  Most books, articles and experts about fishing are, in my experience, failures in their capturing of  the `experience' of fishing.  In fact, most writing (99%) on fishing and  the fishery is given from `outsiders' who haven't experienced something of  what Junger describes, and most fishermen find their theorizing patronizing  (if not insulting).<br />Fishing, like freemasonry, is an insiders experience.   Outsiders are still very much outside.  But a `Perfect Storm' bridges this  gap. I gave a copy to my father (fisherman) and brother-in-law (fisherman),  and this book has captured their imagination like none I can remember  because, unlike 99% of expert drivle, it rings true to the people involved.   This is an amazing achievement and a bouquet given to those who for  centuries were and are seen as disposable good-for-nothings from the point  of view of many landsmen.

US	50869442	R3OCJ0E1PHBKYD	0801481457	556157443	An Ethics of Sexual Difference	Books	5	17	22	N	N	A classic of continental thinking.	Irigaray's `rewriting' of philosophy and philosophers is essential reading for anyone interested in philosophy these days.  It is also a refreshing breath of thought on `Feminism'.  The concept of `Place'is presented as  Woman, a return to the primordial feminine via `deconstruction' (in the  best possible way) of western patriarchial hegemony.  Besides the radical  content, it is is beautifully written - clear and profound. Read this  book!	1999-12-01

I recently attended Michel Serres first anglo appearnce at Memorial University in St. John's Newfoundland.  `The Natural Contract' is a way of thinking and behaving as human beings should with Nature via a Natural  Contract (i.e., an extension of contracterian philosophy).  The idea is so  simple and affecting, the writing so beautiful and clear, that this shouts  for more attention.  Serres the man is beautiful and kind and his `Natural  Contract' is a good antedote for much of the radicalism in environmental  ethics/animal rights these days.	1999-11-30

Like all of Follet's novels, `The Man from St. Petersburg' is a page turner and worth picking up if you like a good historical adventure.  That being said, however, this novel is not that great when compared to `Eye of  The Needle', `The Key to Rebecca' and his masterpiece `The Pillars of The  Earth.'  Follet is a good and sometimes great writer.  The problem I find  with his writing is that sometimes he edits down to 300 pages what would be  a great-classic epic of 1500 pages (i.e., like `Pillars of the Earth').  Sometimes the shorter form works (i.e., `Eye Of The Needle' and `Key to  Rebecca' where the action is close to real time), but sometimes he  shortchanges himself and the reader (i.e., `Man From St. Petersburg' and  `Place called Freedom') by limiting his scope and range to be under a  certain number of pages.  I don't know if this is a publishing thing or  what?<br />If given more room for characters and historical detail, Follet  gives us classic epic novels like `Pillars'.  When he limits himself he  sometimes succeeds and sometimes misses.<br />More longer Follet novels are  better.	1999-11-29
US	50869442	R3PQUSLOEVEDFU	0631184252	532755791	The Concept of Time	Books	4	26	27	N	N	A great way to enter the thought of Martin Heidegger.	The `Concept Of Time' is a lecture Heidegger delivered to the Marburg Theological Society in July of 1924.  Heidegger introduces his `ontological' way of asking the question `what is time?' Heidegger's way of  asking and answering the question of time is not physical `clock-time',  theological or cognitive.  Rather, time is rendered intelligible through  existence - Dasein.  Heidegger distinguishes between authentic time as  running back from the future and the inauthentic spatialization of time as  a now point `t' next to spatial coordinates `x,y,z'.<br />Many readers are  highly intimidated by Heidegger's masterwork `Being and Time' because of  its lenghth, breadth of thought and fusion of language. `The Concept of  Time' is a very short and clear piece and makes an excellent primer for  `Being and Time' and his thought in general.    <br />Highly recommended for  the beginner and any serious scholar who ignored it in the past.	1999-11-06

This book was recommended to me by my professor as an excellent  diversion from my thesis.  He was right. I read this book in one sitting.  `Perfume'  is a beautiful mix of parable, Grimm fairy tale and erotic thriller. I love  this book - much better written than Bram Stoker's Dracula. If you like  Gothic, read this in front of an autumn fire and you will not be  disappointed. I'm going to re-read it in German very soon.	1999-10-29
