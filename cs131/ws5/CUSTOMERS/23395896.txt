Nevertheless, this is definitely worth a look for people interested in meta-ethics (and in metaphysics).  There's no doubt that Putnam is a major contemporary philosopher, and he seems to be in the process of developing a distinctive meta-ethical view.  Part of that process is on display in the lectures constituting the first part of this book.  <br />The focus of Part I, which encompasses the first two-thirds of the volume, is a sustained attack on the assumptions that Putnam believes underlie ontology (the study of what types of things exist) as it has descended from Quine's &quot;On What There Is&quot; and as it is practiced among contemporary analytic philosophers.  There are two assumptions he hopes to undermine:  (i) the assumption that there is a single right answer to ontological questions, and (ii) the assumption that that there is some close connection between ontological issues and issues of objectivity, since objective disciplines are those in which we can and do truly describe objects (i.e. facts, entities, properties, etc.).  He thinks both of these assumptions are false, and that this allows us to draw certain conclusions about the nature and status of ethics.  The most important conclusion is that we don't need some special ethical metaphysics--ethical entities, facts, or properties--to have ethical objectivity.  So the argument here is largely negative, inasmuch as Putnam's fundamental aim is to clear away certain philosophical errors that have led people to be suspicious of the objectivity of ethics.  (Naturally, this suggests that Putnam is committed to a positive project of arguing for some form objectivism about ethics--but the positive project is largely ignored here and the outlines of his objectivism remain unclear here.)<br />Putnam first argues against the assumption that there is a single right answer to ontological questions.  Here he argues for what he calls 'conceptual relativity,' according to which the existence of the sorts of things with which ontologists are concerned is a matter of convention, of the way in which we choose to talk here.  Consequently, there is no single right answer to the question of whether something (e.g. sets of objects) exists or not.  There's no independent fact of the matter here; there's nothing to decide between the various answers.  We have different ways of talking about these things, and Putnam thinks it's a &quot;silly&quot; question to ask whether one way of talking is to be preferred to another.  It's not simply that we don't know enough to determine the right answer; it's not that the question is one we lack the resources to answer.  It is, rather, that the question of which answer is &quot;right&quot; really hasn't been given a clear sense.  But ontology as it is currently practiced rests on an assumption that these things aren't conventional, that there is a single right answer to these questions.  Thus, if the thesis of conceptual relativity is true, there isn't any such answer and ontology is a hopeless enterprise.  <br />According to Putnam, the other general problem with ontology is that it is connected to an assumption that there is an intimate connection between objectivity in various disciplines and the existence of objects (facts, entities, properties) as the subject of those disciplines.  This is relevant to ethics because he thinks we should think of ethics as possessing &quot;objectivity without objects.&quot;  One of the traditional problems with understanding ethics as objective is understanding just what moral facts, properties, etc. are like.  Putnam wants to argue that this apparent difficulty rests on a confusion about the nature of objectivity, for there don't have to be objective moral value entities or non-natural properties or moralfacts in order for us to understand ethics as being objective.  And he argues for this conclusion by drawing a comparison with logic and mathematics, disciplines that seem objective--they seem to admit of truth and falsity, to allow for allow for rational argument, etc.--and yet don't seem to be about distinctive sorts of objects.  Putnam thinks a proper appreciation of the subject will reveal that the same is true of ethics.    <br />Importantly, Putnam's advocation of a sort of pluralism underlies his thinking idea here.  Language, he wants to claim, does many different things, and failing to recognize this can lead to the problematic assumptions contemporary analytic ontologists tend to make.  Putnam himself draws the comparison of his ideas here with the Wittgensteinian idea that there several distinct language games, and that none of them is the ultimate to which all the others must be reduced.  Moral language, logical language, mathematical language--these are all objective, and yet they don't describe facts in the way that scientific language and language about ordinary empirical objects do.  They do something else, and it's only a failure to appreciate the manifold ways in which language is used--the many different uses to which it can be put--that leads us to think that all these uses of language involve trying to describe special sorts of facts.  Thinking that we need to posit special ethical facts, properties, etc. to understand ethics as objective is to inappropriately apply standards from another discipline to ethics.  What we need to realize about ethical objectivity, about ethical truth and rational ethical argument, is that an understanding of it is something we pick up only from within ethical discourse and practice.  <br />As interesting as some of the ideas here are, this book could stand to be about twice as long as it actually is.  The first part was originally a series of lectures, and it reads that way:  it's unnecessarily repetitious in places, and too sketchy in others.  Furthermore, it's not altogether clear what Putnam's positive view is supposed to be since he never explains just what ethical objectivity is supposed to consist in.  And while Putnam's characteristic erudition is on display here--he draws on a thorough knowledge of, inter alia, contemporary analytic philosophy, logic, mathematics, and the history of philosophy--too often his invocation of other philosophers is used to paper over weaknesses in his own arguments.	2004-06-07
US	23395896	R3PGTJ45B9ZL0J	0023180315	431087182	Twentieth Century Ethical Theory	Books	5	12	13	N	N	An Excellent Historical Anthology	This is a fabulous historical anthology of twentieth-century Anglo-American philosophical thinking about ethics.  Cahn and Haber have organized this collection chronologically rather than thematically.  The anthology consists of four sections, each of which covers between twenty and thirty years.  The selections here are extremely well-chosen, and almost all the major figures and trends are represented somewhere in this collection of papers and short book excerpts.  The editors' emphasis is clearly on variety here, as they've included more than one selection from only a handful of figures.  Moreover, where a particular individual does have more than one selection, those selections are usually on distinct topics.      <br />It's possible to discern the general story of twentieth-century ethical thinking behind the decisions made by the editors in selecting the elements of this collection.  That story, in short, is the following:  G. E. Moore's Open Question Argument, and the non-naturalist intuitionism to which it led him, sets the process of twentieth-century meta-ethics in motion; early noncognitivism appears as a response to the perceived inadequacies of the sort of intuitionism defender by Moore and others; there is a backlash against these early, crude forms of noncognitivism that leads to more sophisticated forms of noncognitivism and to both naturalist and non-naturalist forms of cognitivism; and the work of Rawls, et al. on normative ethics leads to a renewed interest among analytic philosophers in normative ethics and in the application of philosophical methods to thinking about substantial moral issues.  <br />Each of this anthology's sections tells part of that story.  The first part provides the reader with an introduction to early intuitionism (Moore, Prichard, Ross, Ewing); the second part illustrates the eventual disillusionment with this form of intuitionism (Mackie, Strawson, Frankena) and the development of revisionary noncognitivism (Perry, Wittgenstein, Ayer, Stevenson) as a response to the perceived excesses of the intuitionist's metaphysical and epistemological views; the third part details the growing disillusionment with noncognitivism (Firth, Lewis, Geach, Foot) and the development of more sophisticated versions of the doctrine (Nowell-Smith and Hare) in response to those worries; and the fourth section reveals the proliferation of types of ethical thinking in contemporary philosophy, including both a revival of interest in normative ethics (Rawls's work, debates about utilitarianism, contractualism/contractarianism, virtue ethics) and the development of a wider variety of meta-ethical views (Nagel, Railton, Harman, Wiggins).  This is, of course, an overly simplified account of the contents of this volume, since each section includes selections that dissent from the consensus of their respective periods as well as works from figures who aren't as much read now as they were in their own time.<br />Now, the reader should realize that the vast majority of the selections in this volume concern meta-ethics rather than normative or applied ethics.  But this is not because the authors consider other areas of philosophical ethics to be less important or because they think the best philosophical thinking about ethics in the analytic tradition has been in meta-ethical work.  It is, rather, an accurate reflection of the nature of most twentieth-century analytic philosophy about ethics, because, for much of the century, many of the major figures in this tradition considered meta-ethics to be the only properly philosophical part of ethical thought.  And one of the most interesting things about this anthology is that it allows one to see how these assumptions about what philosophers could and could not tell us about ethics came into prominence and how these assumptions were gradually undermined.  <br />There were several distinct reasons that philosophers thought that they should focus solely on meta-ethical questions.  The first such reason was that the major meta-ethical theories that were prominent in the first half of the century, viz. intuitionism and early noncognitivism, seemed to undermine the thesis that philosophers, qua philosophers, could have much of interest to say about moral issues.  If one accepted intuitionism, it didn't seem that there was a great deal for philosophers--or, for that matter, anyone else--to say about particular moral issues.  At some point, moral thinking reduced to comparing and contrasting intuitions, and so you either \\"saw\\" it or you didn't.  And early, revisionary forms of noncognitivism suggested similar problems for philosophical thinking about moral issues.  Often the early noncognitivists seemed to reduce ethical discourse seem to the trading of emotional reactions or the attempt to influence the behavior of others with language.  So, on their views, philosophers didn't have any special to contribute to moral discussions since their primary method of inquiry, rational argumentation, had little or no place in moral debate.  And even when these meta-ethical views began to fall out of favor, certain general views about the nature and role of their discipline led philosophers to similar conclusions about what parts of ethical thinking were properly philosophical.  For this was the period of the linguistic turn in philosophy, and a widespread conviction among philosophers of this period was that their task was to clarify the structure and logic of ordinary language.  So philosophers focused on analyzing the meaning of moral terms and elucidating the logic of moral argument as opposed to reaching substantial moral issues.   <br />Soon enough, however, all of these reasons for doubting that philosophers could contribute much of value to substantial moral debates came crashing down.  First, Rawls's work suggested that philosophers could discuss normative views without taking stands in meta-ethics, and it also provided evidence that philosophers could in fact say something influential and important about substantial issues.  Second, intuitionism was largely rejected and noncognitivists like Hare began to argue for less revisionary forms of noncognitivism that allowed some place for rational moral debate.  Third, and finally, the general conception of the philosopher's task as involving only conceptual analysis of various disciplines was largely rejected after the publication of the work of Quine, et al. that led to the abandonment of the tenets logical positivism.<br />And all of this led us to the rich, varied contemporary scene in Anglo-American moral philosophy that is found in the selections of this volume's final section.     <br />This is an excellent anthology for courses covering twentieth-century ethical theory for graduates and advanced undergraduates.  But there's probably not enough contemporary material here for this work to serve as the only text in a course focusing on contemporary ethical theory.	2004-06-06

While Kant himself considered this a sort of introduction to ethical thinking, it's come to be his most influential and widely read work on ethics.  Despite its length--it's less than a hundred pages--this is a work of remarkable depth and intellectual insight.<br />And what makes the Groundwork especially interesting is its clear statement of a distinctive Kantian vision of the nature of morality.  It's not just that this work includes original and exceptionally insightful philosophizing, but that there's a vision of morality underlying the details, and it's a general conception of morality in which there is something inspiring and awesome.  The absolutism, the lack of concern for consequences and for human nature, the emphasis on a sort of radical freedom, the distrust of human feeling, the emphasis on our rationality--all of these are elements of Kant's emphasis on the purity of ethics.  (Later works reveal that Kant's thinking about these issues was considerably more complex, but there is something fundamental about the presentation here--even if it doesn't provide a wholly accurate account of all his thinking.)  Moral action, he claims, is action in which we act for duty's sake, and acting for duty's sake requires an independence of one's actions from our ordinary concerns, from everyday motives and inclinations, from self-interest, and from nearly all human feeling.  And since moral action is free action, understanding moral action in this way requires Kant to carve out a sphere of freedom in which we are the authors of our actions. It's not just that we're free of external constraints in moral action; we also need to be free of the characteristics qualities of our personalities and of the distinctive patterns of thought and feeling that constitute human nature.  Nevertheless, Kant claims that the moral law is one that comes from within--though not from our contingent feelings and desires.  It is instead a law that we give to ourselves as rational beings.  In moral action we act in ways that express our natural as rational beings, and only as rational beings.  So act morally, acting with a wholly good will, is action in which we reveal ourselves to beings deserving of the dignity that comes with being a free and rational being.   <br />Now, even though this is intended as an introduction to Kant's moral thought, this isn't an easy work.  It needs to be read and re-read (and, I suppose, re-read) to be fully understood and appreciated.  I've never found Kant as difficult and obscure as his reputation would suggest, but as a writer of philosophical prose he's certainly not the caliber of, say, Hume or Descartes.  Still, Kant's ideas in the Groundwork, while subtle and sometimes elusive, are profound and original, and this book is a must-read for anyone interested in philosophical ethics.  <br />Kant's aim in the Groundwork is to discover the fundamental principle of morality.  In the first section he attempts to derive this fundamental principle from ordinary moral thought.  In particular, he attempts to derive this principle from considerations concerning what is unconditionally good.  Kant claims that the only thing that is unconditionally good is a good will.  Moreover, its goodness is not a matter of the results of acting on a good will; it is good in itself.  As a matter of fact, Kant claims that the results of an action done with a good will and the aims and inclinations of the agent with the good will are morally insignificant.<br />What, then, is it to act with a good will?  It is, Kant argues, a matter of doing one's duty for duty's sake, regardless of one's feeling and the results of doing so.  What is it to act from duty's sake? It is to act from principles that accord with the fundamental principle of morality.  And here we get the first formulation of the fundamental principle of morality: act only on maxims that you can consistently will to be universal laws. In other words, if one is unable to will the principle of one's action to become a universal law, the action is morally impermissible.<br />In the second section of the Groundwork Kant attempts to draw the same conclusion from some philosophical points about the nature of duty.  He begins by claiming that our knowledge of our duty is a priori and based on the exercise of reason.  He then argues that facts about our duties are necessary facts, and that this shows that they must be based on a categorical imperative: that is, that our duties apply to us insofar as we are rational beings, irrespective of the contingent aspects of their nature.  And, Kant argues, the one categorical imperative is the fundamental principle of morality mentioned above.  He then applies this principle to some examples in order to display just how it grounds our duties in particular cases.<br />The rest of the second section is filled with lots of interesting, albeit abstruse, ideas.  First, Kant attempts to ground the categorical imperative in something that is of unconditional worth.  What is that something?  The existence of rational beings, which, he says, is an end in itself.  And this leads to a second formulation of the categorical imperative: (ii) act only in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in the person of yourself or someone else, as an end and never merely as a means.<br />This section also includes a third formulation of the categorical imperative: (iii) act only on maxims that you could will to become universal laws legislated by your own will.  This formulation encapsulates Kant's claim that we can achieve autonomy only by acting in accordance with the moral law.  Conformity with the moral law does not constrain our freedom since we legislate the moral law for ourselves.  The moral law is not forced on us from without; its source is to be found in our own rational nature.  Indeed, it is only by acting morally that we are able to achieve genuine freedom by transcending the contingent desires and inclinations that are beyond our control.<br />Of course, that doesn't come close to summing up the Groundwork.  But it's a start.	2004-06-06

Few books I've encountered include this much first-rate philosophy for the price, and so I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Hume's thinking about religion.  It includes the section on miracles from Hume's Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals and the full versions of both The Natural History of Religion and the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion.  (Hume's short autobiography, &quot;My Own Life,&quot; is also included.)  Furthermore, Gaskin has provided some helpful editorial material:  there's a useful introductory essay discussing the selections, and he includes explanatory notes that clarify some of Hume's more obscure references.  <br />The central theme of Hume's religious thought is the central theme of his philosophical thought as a whole--namely the extent of our ignorance and the impotence of human reason to discover the things we really want to discover.  And, for this reason, his writing on religion provides a good illustration of his general philosophical method:  he begins by pointing out the impotence of reason, and then he offers a naturalistic psychological explanation of why we continue to think as we do.  Our tendency to believe various religious thesis, he argues, cannot be explained as a justifiable way of thinking about the world that we arrive at through the use of reason.  It is, instead, explained by certain general principles governing the operation of human minds.  And two major works in this volume illustrate the two components of Hume's philosophical method.  In the Dialogues he argues that neither empirical research nor the a priori exercise of reason is likely to reveal that our religious beliefs are justified.  In The Natural History he begins the project of explaining why we do in fact believe what we do about religion.  <br />As I said above, the Dialogues pertain to the first part of the method.  Most of the Dialogues is devoted to discussion of a posteriori arguments for the existence of God, though there is also a short section on various a priori arguments.  The main argument considered here is the classical argument from design, which Hume seems to understand as an analogical argument of the following sort:  the complexity and order of the universe show that it is similar to artifacts created by human intelligences; similar causes have similar effects; therefore, the universe must have been created by a being with something like a human intelligence; therefore, the universe must have been created by God.<br />Hume's objections to this argument are legion, and many of the individual objections are both ingenious and forceful.  He provides reasons for thinking that the universe isn't all that similar to artifacts created by human beings.  Hume also provides for thinking that, even if we think the universe is similar to a human artifact, we ought to think the universe was created by a being quite unlike God.  In addition, he suggests certain speculative naturalistic explanations of the existence and nature of the universe; and he claims that it's unclear why an appeal to divine creation is to be preferred to these speculative naturalistic stories of the universe's creation.  Hume's cumulative case against the argument from design is quite impressive.  Indeed, I'm pretty sure that Hume has shown that the argument from design is more or less worthless as support for anything resembling traditional theism.  <br />But where, in the end, does Hume come down on the issue of theism?  It seems clear that he has no sympathy for organized religion, or for any religious views that purport to describe the nature of God, His intentions, or how and why He created the universe as He did.  For any such religious view is going to overstep the bounds within which he thinks human reason can operate.  And the only positive religious claim that is given respectful treatment here is the bare claimthat we have reason to think that the cause of the universe as a whole is somewhat similar to a human intelligence.  But does acceptance of this minimal thesis amount to his being a theist?  It's very hard to tell.  The problem is that it often seems Hume's explicit advocation of this position amounts to little more than a description of what he thinks is an inevitable human tendency to think this way.  <br />And this is where the second part of his project, the part carried out in The Natural History of Religion, becomes relevant.  For The Natural History is the work in which Hume sets out to trace the sources of religious belief to certain natural principles of the human mind.  There he argues that the the operation of our minds, along with the conditions in which we find ourselves, leads us to arrive at the sorts of religious beliefs we find to be popular in past and present human societies.  Our ignorance about the way the world operates and our apprehensiveness about the ways these unknowns can affect our lives naturally lead human beings to a form of polytheism.   We tend to attribute the underlying principles by which the world operates to a large number human-like beings, and this is what polytheistic religion amounts to.  But once polytheism is in place our tendency to attribute greater powers and more perfect natures to individual gods leads us to something closer to monotheistic views according to which there is a single wholly perfect being behind all the underlying principles governing the world and behind the existence of the world itself.  <br />It should be clear, then, why it's difficult to pin down just what Hume though about religion.  He does think that it's hard for beings like us to deny the general thesis that the universe as a whole was probably created by a human-like intelligence.  For given how our minds actually work, he seems to think, we're bound to think something like this about the origin of the universe.  Yet it's somewhat unclear that he thinks forming beliefs in this way is reliable.  It may simply be that we have a brute instinct to think in a way that insures we'll see the world as resulting from some human-like intelligence, and it's at least not clear that that isn't a debunking account of the plausibility of theism.	2004-06-05

It needs to be read and re-read (and, I suppose, re-read) to be fully understood and appeciated.  I've never found Kant as difficult and obscure as his reputation would suggest, but as a writer of philosophical prose he's certainly not the caliber of, say, Hume or Descartes.  As many have noted, Kant is the first great philosopher of the modern era to have been an academic, and it shows.  He writes long, meandering sentences, and the organization of his works leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Furthermore, his penchant for arcane terminology and architechtonic can make his work seem more forbidding than it is.  Still, Kant's ideas in the Groundwork, while subtle and sometimes elusive, are profound and original, and this book is a must-read for anyone interested in philosophical ethics.  I should also note that the importance of this book isn't solely historical since there has been a recent resurgence of Kantian moral thinking in the English-speaking world.<br />Kant's aim in the Groundwork is to discover the fundamental principle of morality.  In the first section he attempts to derive this fundamental principle from odinary moral thought.  In particular, he attempts to derive this principle from considerations concerning what is unconditionally good.  Kant claims that the only thing that is unconditionally good is a good will.  Moreover, its goodness is not a matter of the results of acting on a good will; it is good in itself.

But it's a start. <br />This edition of the Groundwork, which has been translated by Lewis White Beck, is a readable one.  It is, perhaps, easier to read than many other editions of the Groundwork, though it may provide for this readability at the cost of some accuracy.  Beck's edition also includes a copy of Kant's essay &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; along with some slight editorial material.  There's a short, albeit useful, introductory essay in which Beck sketches the main outlines of the argument of the Groundwork's three sections and considers and dismisses some common objections to Kant's moral theory.  The editorial also material includes a very short biographical sketch and a slight and out-of-date bibliography.  Neither of these is very helpful.  There are better editions of the Groundwork out there--see, for example, the editions published by Cambridge (translation by Gregor) and by Harper (translation by Paton)--but this is fine edition for the student and the general reader.  And it comes at a good price.	2004-06-03
US	23395896	R1AH7IZHP0VY9W	0140445366	561231900	Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	20	22	N	N	A Paradigm of Philosophy	With the possible exception of his incalculably influential A Treatise of Human Nature, this, I think, is Hume's finest work.  The Dialogues is a paradigm of sustained philosophical argumentation on a single subject, and I can't think of a more inspiring work of philosophy.  Another reason to read this book is that Hume is one of the few philosophical figures whose work is worth reading as literature.  His prose is, of course, lovely and clear as can be; and the Dialogues is packed with the sort of evocative passages that readers of Hume except to find in his work.  Furthermore, he's clearly mastered the dialogue format as a way of writing philosophy.  He never turns his interlocutors into ciphers spouting the details of their respective positions.  Each character has a forceful and distinct personality, and each of them comes to the debate with a well-defined position and adequate means of defending it.  In short, I can't recommend this book highly enough.  <br />Most of the Dialogues is devoted to discussion of a posteriori arguments for the existence of God.  The main argument considered here is the classical argument from design, which Hume seems to understand as an analogical argument of the following sort:  the complexity and order of the universe show that it is similar to artifacts created by human intelligences; similar causes have similar effects; therefore, the universe must have been created by a being with something like a human intelligence; therefore, the universe must have been created by God.<br />Hume's objections to this argument are legion, and many of the individual objections are both ingenious and forceful.  He provides reasons for thinking that the universe isn't all that similar to artifacts created by human beings.  He argues, for instance, that at least in some respects, the universe resembles animal or vegetable life more than it resembles artifacts created by human beings.  Hume also provides for thinking that, even if we think the universe is similar to a human artifact, we ought to think the universe was created by a being quite unlike God.  The relevant empirical evidence, he argues, provides us with no good reason to think that the universe wasn't created by multiple beings (large human artifacts are usually created by multiple beings), or that the being(s) who created it are still alive (human creators die), or that the being(s) who created it were infinite (it's not clear that creating the finite universe would have required infinite power), or that the being(s) who created it were morally perfect (the universe, with all its misery and despair, certainly isn't what one would expect from a perfect being).  Furthermore, he proposes certain alternative naturalistic explanations of the existence and nature of the universe; and he claims that it's unclear why an appeal to divine creation is to be preferred to these speculative naturalistic stories of the universe's creation.        <br />As I hope this all-too-brief synopsis suggests, Hume's cumulative case against the argument from design is quite impressive.  It is, of course, possible to avoid some of these criticisms in various ways, and his speculative naturalistic explanations leave quite a bit to be desired.  But the total case is a philosophical demolition par excellence.  Indeed, I'm pretty sure that Hume has shown that the argument from design is more or less worthless as support for anything resembling traditional theism.  So, if you're enamored of that argument, I suggest you pick up book and wrestle with the criticisms found here.   <br />Now, this isn't all Hume discusses in the Dialogues.  There's a section discussing a priori arguments for the existence of God; it focuses on arguments against a version of the cosmological (i.e. first cause) argument.  And Hume's arguments concerning the cosmological argument also rule out any sort of ontological argument, as he claims that no sense can be made of the idea of a necessarily existingbeing.  The book also includes a few some brief discussion of particular issues concerning religion.  <br />Where, in the end, does Hume come down on the issue of theism? It's hard to tell, as it's not clear that any of the particular characters speaks for him.  Philo, the character who often appears to be speaking for him, never denies the existence of a deity; he simply denies the ability of human reason to discover anything substantial about what such a being is like.  That Hume agrees with this is, I think, the most we can glean from this text about Hume's own religious views.  It seems clear that he has no sympathy for organized religion, or for any religious views that purport to describe the nature of God, His intentions, or how and why He created the universe as He did.  And the only positive religious claim that is given respectful treatment here is the bare claim that we have reason to think that the cause of the universe as a whole is somewhat similar to a human intelligence.  <br />But does acceptance of this minimal thesis amount to his being a theist?  Again, it's very hard to tell.  First, of course, one might wonder whether this fairly vague positive view is enough to amount to some form of theism.  But let's put that issue to one side.  Even if it is enough to support some form of theism, it's often difficult to tell whether Hume means to be advocating such a position here.  The problem is that it often seems Hume's explicit advocation of this position amounts to little more than a description of what he thinks is an inevitable human tendency to think this way.  Given how our minds actually work, he seems to think, we're bound to think something like this about the origin of the universe.  Yet it's somewhat unclear that he thinks forming beliefs in this way is reliable.  It may simply be that we have a brute instinct to think in a way that insures we'll see the world as resulting from some human-like intelligence, and it's at least not clear that that isn't a debunking account of the plausibility of theism.  (For more support that this is a debunking explanation, see his The Natural History of Religion, where the explanations of various religious beliefs certainly seem to be one's that suggest those beliefs simply aren't plausible.)	2004-06-02

It's far and away the best edition of this philosophical classic of which I'm aware.  For this volume, unlike most editions of philosophical classics, includes very extensive editorial material; and that material is written by Norman Kemp Smith, a major twentieth-century Hume scholar.  What, exactly, do you get in this edition?  Well, you get details about the publication of the text, biographical facts relevant to Hume's religious views, a general account of Hume's religious views, a short essay summarizing the main lines of argument in the Dialogues, a thirty-page dialogue-by-dialogue critical analysis of text, a copy of Hume' short autobiographical essay &quot;My Own Life,&quot; and more.  Indeed, the editorial material here is longer than the text of the Dialogues itself.  It's quite a package.<BR>    <BR>And, of course, you get the masterful text of the Dialogues along with that wonderful editorial material.  With the possible exception of his incalculably influential A Treatise of Human Nature, this, I think, is Hume's finest work.  The Dialogues is a paradigm of sustained philosophical argumentation on a single subject, and I can't think of a more inspiring work of philosophy.  Furthermore, this is one of the few works of philosophy that is worth reading as literature.  Hume's prose is, of course, lovely and clear as can be; and the Dialogues is packed with the sort of evocative passages that readers of Hume except to find in his work.  He has, moreover, clearly mastered the dialogue format as a way of writing philosophy.  He never turns his interlocutors into ciphers spouting the details of their respective positions.  Each character has a forceful and distinct personality, and each of them comes to the debate with a well-defined position and adequate means of defending it.  <br />Most of the Dialogues is devoted to discussion of a posteriori arguments for the existence of God.  The main argument considered here is the classical argument from design, which Hume seems to understand as an analogical argument of the following sort:  the complexity and order of the universe show that it is similar to artifacts created by human intelligences; similar causes have similar effects; therefore, the universe must have been created by a being with something like a human intelligence; therefore, the universe must have been created by God.<br />Hume's objections to this argument are legion, and many of the individual objections are both ingenious and forceful.  He provides reasons for thinking that the universe isn't all that similar to artifacts created by human beings.  He argues, for instance, that at least in some respects, the universe resembles animal or vegetable life more than it resembles artifacts created by human beings.  Hume also provides for thinking that, even if we think the universe is similar to a human artifact, we ought to think the universe was created by a being quite unlike God.  The relevant empirical evidence, he argues, provides us with no good reason to think that the universe wasn't created by multiple beings (large human artifacts are usually created by multiple beings), or that the being(s) who created it are still alive (human creators die), or that the being(s) who created it were infinite (it's not clear that creating the finite universe would have required infinite power), or that the being(s) who created it were morally perfect (the universe, with all its misery and despair, certainly isn't what one would expect from a perfect being).  Furthermore, he proposes certain alternative naturalistic explanations of the existence and nature of the universe; and he claims that it's unclear why an appeal to divine creation is to be preferred to these speculative naturalistic stories of the universe's creation.        <br />As I hope this all-too-brief synopsis suggests, Hume's cumulative case against the argument from design is quite impressive.  It is, of course, possible to avoid some of these criticisms in various ways, and his speculative naturalistic explanations leave quite a bit to be desired.  But the total case is a philosophical demolition par excellence.  Indeed, I'm pretty sure that Hume has shown that the argument from design is more or less worthless as support for anything resembling traditional theism.  So, if you're enamored of that argument, I suggest you pick up book and wrestle with the criticisms found here.   <br />Where, then, does Hume come down on the issue of theism? It's hard to tell, as it's not clear that any of the particular characters speaks for him.  Philo, the character who often appears to be speaking for him, never denies the existence of a deity; he simply denies the ability of human reason to discover anything substantial about what such a being is like.

And there's a short introduction that focuses on both Hume's intentions in these works and historical details concerning their creation, publication, and influence.  Finally, the reader should be aware that spelling and capitalization have been modernized in this edition.	2004-06-02
US	23395896	R1LRL8JMMYYGE9	0140249079	586405329	Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey	Books	4	45	46	N	N	Very Useful for Intermediate Students	I purchased Scruton's survey as an first-year undergraduate student who was eager to learn just about everything there is to learn about philosophy, and it proved very useful to me throughout my undergraduate career.  And it's heartening to flip back through this book and see that I've actually learned a good deal in time I've spent studying philosophy.  Before long I may know enough to write a book of this sort myself--not that I have the patience or talent for exposition that would be required to do so.<br /><br />The aim of this book is to provide a synoptic overview of the concerns and central arguments of philosophy from the seventeenth century to the present.  It covers, at least briefly, just about everything that modern philosophers talk about, it displays broad historical erudition, it provides the reader with a sense of how the concerns of contemporary philosophers connect to the history of modern philosophers, and its extensive reading guide gives the reader some helpful suggestions about where to go in the literature for further work on the topics discussed here.  It is, moreover, quite good at introducing the basic issues and positions, both of contemporary philosophers and their early modern counterparts, in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.  And, although this isn't intended as a work of history, Scruton manages to present most of the major ideas of the most significant figures in modern philosophy (e.g. Descartes, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, et al.).<br />Scruton's subject matter here is broad, to say the least.  He discusses just about every subject about which philosophers have had anything to say in the last four hundred years.  This book has sections about God, about free will, about morality, about politics, about science, about knowledge and belief, about minds and their relations to bodies, about language and its meaning, about space and time, about mathematics, and about quite a few more things.  Indeed, there's simply too much covered here for Scruton to connect all the material and provide much structure to this book.  So it's perfectly fine to treat this book as something like a reference work, and to dip into whatever section one finds interesting while ignoring much of the rest of the book.  But, for people with little background in philosophy, it would help to begin by reading the fifteen or so chapters straight through.  These chapters, which comprise roughly the first third of the book, outline the basic historical and contemporary philosophical ideas that the reader needs to understand most of the rest of the book, and they constitute a pretty good introduction to the material in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind that you need to know to understand the rest of the material here.<br />Despite Scruton's professed intentions here, however, this text is probably too complex and too compressed for the absolute beginner.  Even working with five hundred pages of space, he's forced to cram quite a bit into a short space.  Scruton acquits himself well, of course, but it's simply not possible to explain these things as thoroughly as beginners are probably going to need them explained.  He tends to cover in twenty pages what most introductory books cover in two hundred.  And while this makes his book an invaluable resource of information about philosophy, it also precludes the sort of patient exposition that might be necessary in presenting this material to beginning students of the subject.<br />I'd recommend this book to people with some background in philosophy who'd like a single-book overview of the subject, and to intermediate students looking for a comprehensive reference work that you can actually read.  And if you're unusually ambitious, you might try this as an introduction to philosophy.  If you can master everything in this book, you'll almost have the equivalent of an excellent undergraduateeducation in philosophy.  (You'll just need to learn some formal logic, and it wouldn't hurt to learn some additional material in ethics and political philosophy since Scruton's coverage of these areas is somewhat more superficial than his coverage of metaphysics and epistemology.)	2004-06-01

Curd and Cover deserve to be commended--and I hereby commend them--for their work in editing this volume.  Not only have they made compiled a very useful anthology of approximately fifty selections in contemporary philosophy of science, but they've included a very significant amount of original editorial material.  Indeed, I've never seen a philosophy anthology with editorial material anywhere near this extensive or helpful.  Curd and Cover provide the reader with introductions to each section; detailed and thoughtful commentaries, many of which are forty to fifty pages long, on the readings at the end of each section; a twenty-page glossary of terms; and extensive bibliographies on each of the subjects covered.  Roughly a third of this book, which is 1300+ pages long, has been written by the editors.  <br />Because of the comprehensiveness of the commentaries that Curd and Cover have included on each section of readings, this volume, unlike many such anthologies, works very well as a stand-alone introduction to the field.  For these commentaries provide the necessary background that the reader needs to fully appreciate the problems with which the authors of particular selections are struggling, the arguments they present in the selections, and the importance of the various selections in contemporary thinking about how best to solve the problems of the philosophy of science.  In other words, the commentaries here do much of the work that a lecturer would do, and so reading these papers along with the commentaries is like going through an excellent and wide-ranging introductory course in the philosophy of science.<br />This anthology is intended to introduce the most general subjects in contemporary philosophy of science.  Curd and Cover emphasize work in the philosophy of science that is of importance to anyone interested in the subject, and they have deliberately tried to avoid including readings that assume the reader is familiar with a great deal of contemporary science or its history.  There are sections on each of the following topics:  the demarcation problem (the problem of isolating what, if anything, is essential to, and distinctive of, scientific inquiry), values and objectivity in science, underdetermination and the Duhem-Quine thesis, induction and the nature of scientific evidence, explanation, laws of nature, intertheoretic reduction, and scientific realism.  Most of these sections include four or five papers (the section on realism, which is by far the largest section, contains about twice as many).  And this book includes work by many of the most important figures in these areas, including Kuhn, Popper, Hempel, Lakatos, Laudan, Kitcher, van Fraassen, et al.  <br />And the reader should note that this anthology focuses only on work in the natural sciences.  None of these selections discusses philosophical issues arising in the social sciences--though the topics covered are of sufficient generality that they should be of interest to people studying the social sciences as well.  Furthermore, none of these selections are primarily about the philosophical issues arising in particular natural sciences.  So don't come to this anthology looking for philosophy of biology or philosophy of physics.  <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the philosophy of science, and it's ideal for classes introducing philosophy of science to advanced undergraduates and to graduate students.	2004-05-31
US	23395896	R21RVGN8QWPBQF	0674010485	818790146	Quintessence: Basic Readings from the Philosophy of W. V. Quine	Books	5	58	58	N	N	Essential Analytic Philosophy	This handsome and useful volume is an anthology of selections from the work of W. V. O. Quine, who is arguably the most important analytic philosopher of the second half of the twentieth century.  Finally, a few years after his death, he has an anthology of his own--and, unsurprisingly, it's a good one.  The influence of his doctrines and methods within contemporary analytic philosophy, especially in the United States, has been pervasive and profound, and that influence is present in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of logic, and philosophy of science.  (The only figures of comparable influence I can think of are, in no particular order, Kuhn, Putnam, Kripke, Lewis, and Davidson.  And several of them have been deeply influenced by Quine.)  <br />But, unlike some philosophers, Quine's importance isn't so much a matter of the views he defends, even though many of them have played a prominent role in recent discussions.  Many of his most distinctive views have the form of forceful challenges to certain widely held assumptions, including the idea that there are determinate facts about what our sentences mean, the idea that our words refer to particular things in the world, the idea that we have minds (in the ordinary sense), the idea that there are de re modal truths, the idea that we can draw a distinction between analytic and synthetic truths, the idea that there can be a normative epistemology, and so on.  Quine's negative arguments against all these common assumptions share a single general strategy:  the problem with these ideas, he claims, is that they are inconsistent with a suitably naturalistic conception of the world and its relation to human theorizing.  And this reveals that true source of Quine's influence on contemporary philosophy--his radical and unrepentant naturalism.  So his most important influence has been on general conceptions of what philosophy is, how it should be done, and what relations it stands in to other disciplines, and especially to the natural sciences.  You'd better know Quine's work if you want to understand the origin and motivations of all the following trends, attitudes, and assumptions in contemporary philosophy:  the ascendancy of various forms of naturalism and physicalism, attempts to connect philosophy and language and philosophy of mind to scientific works in those fields, the common conception of how ontological debates should be conducted, the dismantling of the assumptions of logical positivism, the general disillusionment with conceptual analysis as a method for conducting philosophy, skepticism about a priori knowledge and justification, the rise of coherentist epistemological views, and the influence of holistic semantics.  Indeed, two opposed contingents in contemporary philosophy, hardcore naturalists and global anti-realists and relativists, both claim Quine one of their key forebears.  And you know someone is a major figure in philosophy when there are opposed groups of philosophers who disagree about everything and yet both claim to be carrying on your research.<br />The selections in this volume come from throughout Quine's long and distinguished career.  Most of the selections are from essays that originally appeared in journals or collections, though a few of them are selections from longer works.  The twenty-five selections here are arranged topically rather than chronologically, and five general topics are covered here:  analyticity, the indeterminacy of translation and the inscrutability of reference, ontology, naturalized epistemology and Quine's behaviorist/eliminativist philosophy of mind, and modality and other intensional notions.  But this anthology is not intended as a collection of Quine's &quot;greatest hits.&quot;  While several of these papers (viz. &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism,&quot; &quot;On What There Is,&quot;&quot;Epistemology Naturalized&quot;) are oft-reprinted classics, not all of them are among his most famous work.  The editorial decisions here have been guided by an overriding aim of presenting Quine's characteristic doctrines on his own works, and not by the aim of collecting his most widely read works in a single volume.    <br />The avowed intention here is to provide the reader with an introduction to Quine's thought through his own writings.  The selections are, of course, well-chosen for that purpose, in that most of them are clear, relatively accessible, and largely non-technical.  However, the reader should be aware that there is almost no editorial material here--just a very short introduction--and that the papers in this volume are expected to speak for themselves.  Some context is provided by Quine himself, as several of these pieces include his own account of the elements of then-current philosophy to which he was responding and what he thought was wrong with them.  He is, moreover, also quick to point out the general outlines of his thought and his overriding motivations.  But, as helpful as this is, I doubt this is enough background to make many of these selections accessible to people with little background in contemporary analytic philosophy and its concerns.  If the reader is looking for some more background on Quine's views, it might help to read his short books The Pursuit of Truth and From Stimulus to Science in conjunction with this volume.  In both those works Quine himself attempts to provide a general overview of certain important elements of his thought on the various subjects here.  And although this collection does not involve any of Quine's work in formal logic, some familiarity with first-order logic is going to be essential to understanding many of these selections.  If you can't at least read the symbolism, parts of this are going to be tough going.     <br />This is a good volume for advanced undergraduates and graduate students who want to acquire familiarity with the main outlines of Quine's positions.  It's also just nice to have a collection of short works form Quine on his main theses.  Yet there's really no reason that this is a necessary purchase for people who already possess Quine's prior collections of essays, because all but a few of these selections come from articles already collected in From a Logical Point of View, The Ways of Paradox, and Theories and Things.  (The remaining selections include a few of his papers that haven't yet been reprinted along with a couple of selections from his books.)	2004-05-31
US	23395896	R2WDPEIVJT4FTU	063120279X	626636232	Metaphysics: An Anthology (Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies)	Books	5	27	29	N	N	Wonderful Anthology in Contemporary Metaphysics	Sosa and Kim have done it again.  So far as I know, this is the single best anthology of contemporary metaphysics for advanced students in the field.  It's coverage is broad, the readings have been carefully selected, and it touches on the most of the central areas of research in the area.   Furthermore, this anthology is packed with papers that display the virtues of good analytic philosophy:  patience in explaining the nature and importance of the issues, precision in exposition and description, clarity and honesty of argument, and carefulness in analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various positions.<br />The subjects covered here are existence (ontological commitment), identity, modality, universals and properties, persistence through time, personal identity, causation, supervenience, and global realism vs. anti-realism.  The aim of the individual sections on each of these questions isn't to provide a synoptic view of the positions in these areas.  That, of course, simply couldn't be done in an anthology of this sort.  The aim instead is to give the reader a sense of the positions defended in this area, to provide her with the outlines of a couple possible positions on each of the issues, and to give her the background to enter into the contemporary literature on the subjects.  <br />Still, this is not an anthology that is stuffed with introductory material by the editors themselves.  Most of the sections begin with only a page or two of introductory material, and those few pages are expected to both introduce the basic issues in a few paragraphs and relate the readings included to the basic issues and to one another.  However, many of the sections begin with a selection that does the work of introducing the basic issues on the subject as well as presenting a particular position on it.  And, as is often the case in philosophy, many of the basic issues discussed don't need much motivation since they can be stated in a few words and since they concern questions that, on their face, are quite straightforward and simple.  Some of the questions discussed here are:  What is it for something to exist, and when do we have good reason to think something exists?  What is it to be the same thing through time?  What is it for me to be the same person through time?  What is it for one thing to cause one another?  Is there an objective reality?    <br />This is material that you need to know if you plan to do work in pretty much any area of philosophy.  It doesn't seem that you can do much work in contemporary philosophy without encountering modal issues, supervenience theses, identity claims, general ontological issues, claims about the nature of properties, etc.  All of these are extremely general, and they're of importance to meta-ethics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, the history of philosophy, etc.  So you need to know something about this material if you're going to study just about anything in contemporary philosophy, and reading the selections in this volume would be a good place to start.  <BR>  <BR>The reader should know that this is emphatically not a historically anthology, that it's not a place to go for knowledge of the metaphysical views of the great philosophers.  These are all contemporary readings.  Nearly every election is from the last fifty years, and a good many of them are from the last twenty or so.  So the focus of this anthology is on the sort of metaphysics that is being done in analytic philosophy right now.  Also, unless you have a thorough grounding in other areas of contemporary philosophy, this is not an anthology I'd recommend for someone beginning study of the subject.  While some of its selections should be accessible to anyone with an interest in this subject, many of them technical and philosophically sophisticated.  Since many of these selections are journal articles or selections from book-length treatises on the issues, the authors often assume that the reader is coming to this material with a thorough grounding in the aims and methods of contemporary philosophy.  So, before you try to tackle most of this anthology, I'd recommend reading an introductory text in contemporary metaphysics or at least doing some coursework in related areas of contemporary philosophy.<br />This is an ideal anthology for courses surveying contemporary metaphysics that are aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  The only drawback is the fairly high price, but this book is certainly worth it if you're interested in this area of contemporary analytic philosophy.	2004-05-30

(That, of course, isn't to say that there isn't a better anthology in epistemology; there are simply far too many philosophy anthologies for me to know that with any certainly.)  The virtues of this anthology are considerable.  Its coverage of most areas is broad, the readings have been carefully selected from the contemporary classics of the field, and it touches on the most of the central areas of research in contemporary epistemology.   Furthermore, this anthology is packed with papers displaying the virtues of good analytic philosophy:  patience in explaining the nature and importance of the issues, precision in exposition and description, clarity and honesty of argument, and carefulness in analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various positions.<br />The reader should know that this is emphatically not a historically anthology--they don't even include a selection on skepticism by Descartes!  Since these are all contemporary readings, this anthology isn't a place to go for knowledge of the epistemological views of the great philosophers.  Nearly every election is from the last fifty years, and a good many of them are from the last twenty or so.  So the focus of this anthology is on the sort of metaphysics that is being done in analytic philosophy right now.  <br />The subjects covered include, inter alia, the following:  skepticism, the analysis of knowledge, justification, foundationalism vs. coherentism, naturalized epistemology, externalism vs. internalism, virtue epistemology, and contextualism.  The aim of the individual sections on each of these questions isn't to provide a synoptic view of the positions in these areas.  That, of course, simplycouldn't be done in an anthology of this sort.  The aim instead is to give the reader a sense of the positions defended in this area, to provide her with the outlines of a couple possible positions on each of the issues, and to give her the background to enter into the contemporary literature on the subjects.  <BR>  <BR>Now, it may seem that there are some obvious lacunae in this list.  Where, for instance, is coverage of rationalism and a priori knowledge or of the problem of induction?  It is, of course, true that more could have been added to this anthology--but that's going to be true of any anthology.  I doubt it's a major problem here, though, as it seems to me that you'll have no problems engaging with most of the literature in contemporary epistemology if you've mastered the material covered in this anthology.  And it seems to me that this is the role that an anthology of this sort should play--providing the reader with an entry into contemporary literature in the field.  <br />But while I think this is an ideal way to introduce oneself to the contemporary literature, the reader should know that this isn't an anthology filled with introductory material by the editors themselves.  Most of the sections begin with only a page or two of introductory material, and those few pages are expected to both introduce the basic issues in a few paragraphs and relate the readings included to the basic issues and to one another.  It's not clear to me that much more than this sort of brief introductory material is necessary here, though.  First, as is often the case in philosophy, many of the basic issues discussed don't need much motivation since they can be stated in a few words and since they concern questions that, on their face, are quite straightforward and simple.  But there is more to it than that.  What seems most important is that the subject matter of most epistemological worry is pretty narrowly focused.  For epistemology is really concerned with a small number of very basic and interrelated questions (viz. Can we know anything?  And, if so, how can we know it?  What is it to know something?), and so it's possible to see most all of these selections as engaged with a limited range of general issues.  Moreover, it is possible to see general connections between the different subjects here since many of the positions discussed are motivated by a concern with rebutting skepticism.  In fact, the structure of anthology mirrors the structure of epistemology from Descartes to the present day:  we begin with challenge presented by skepticism, and we go from there.  The anthology begins with a section on skepticism, and it's possible to see almost everything thereafter as involving an attempt to deal with skepticism and what it shows us about our knowledge of the world.  Many papers discuss how the skepticism is formulated, why it seems plausible, why it goes wrong (if it does), how we can meet the skeptic's demand, or why the skeptic doesn't really present us with a challenge.  <BR>  <BR>Naturally, this material is going to be helpful for people working in other areas of philosophy, as epistemological issues turn up everywhere.  Skepticism and responses to it have a role to play in every area of philosophy, and so understanding the material in this anthology should be helpful if you're going to study just about anything in contemporary philosophy.  But, unless you already have some background in contemporary philosophy, this is not an anthology I'd recommend for someone beginning study of the subject.  While some of its selections should be accessible to anyone with an interest in this subject, many of them technical and philosophically sophisticated.  Since many of these selections are journal articles or selections from book-length treatises on the issues, the authors often assume that the reader is coming to this material with a thorough grounding in the aims and methods of contemporary philosophy.  So, before you try to tackle most of this anthology, I'd recommend reading an introductory text in contemporary epistemology or at least doing some coursework in related areas.  <br />This is an ideal anthology for courses surveying contemporary metaphysics that are aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  The only drawback is the fairly high price, but this book is certainly worth it if you're interested in this area of contemporary analytic philosophy.	2004-05-30

And, of course, it is an ideal text to be read in conjunction with that book.  The subjects discussed in that book are given sections in this anthology, and Loux includes many, though not all, of the primary sources on which he relied in that book.  Nevertheless, I see no reason why this book has to be read in conjunction with the other book.  It is a perfectly fine selection of readings for a person who wants a picture of some of the main areas of debate in contemporary analytic metaphysics.  Loux has provided a brief (roughly ten-page) introduction to each of the topics on which there are readings.  Some of these introductions sketch the problems and quickly describe the main theses of each of the readings and how the readings relate to one other, and others simply provide a general overview of the problems without saying much about the particular readings.  But all of these introductions, which are intended to explain and motivate the problem(s) to which the particular selections respond, should be very helpful to the beginner, and they probably provide enough background to begin reading the selections even if one has had no prior experience in these areas.  So while this anthology doesn't cover everything of interest in contemporary metaphysics, it includes selections on enough topics that it provides the reader with a sense of what is going on in analytic metaphysics at the moment.<br />The subjects covered in this anthology are universals, particulars, possible worlds, time, persistence through time, and global realism vs. anti-realism.  Most of the sections include four or five readings apiece, and Loux has wisely decided not to dumb down this volume by selecting only works written for beginners.  The individual selections, which primarily come from journal argues and monographs on the particular subjects, aren't easy, but most of them aren't forbiddingly difficult either.  They should be accessible to anyone who has had a little philosophy and who carefully reads Loux's introductions to the particular sections.  (It would, of course, help to read through the relevant sections in Loux's textbook before tackling the particular selections in this volume.)  Furthermore, he has wisely selected work that has been very influential but that isn't overly technical.  Most of the selections here are by important figures (Russell, Quine, Putnam, Lewis, Dummett, Plantinga, Kripke, Armstrong, van Inwagen, et al.) in the field, and many of them concern views that have set the agenda in these debates.  <br />But the reader should note that Loux has not included any work from the historical figures he discusses in his book.  This is an anthology of selections in contemporary metaphysics, and so it does not include selections from important historical figures in the field.  The reader should also note that Loux does not include any readings on the general structure and methods of metaphysical inquiry, though this is one of the subjects frequently discussed in his textbook.  Naturally, though, the reader should acquire a sense of the general structure and methods of metaphysics by reading the various selections included here.  But if you're looking for more explicit coverage of these issues, you'll need to look elsewhere.       <br />This is a very nice anthology, and it's especially good for the price.  It's not as extensive as it might have been--but, then again, it is intended as an introduction to work in contemporary metaphysics and not as an exhaustive survey of the subject.  (For a more in-depth and extensive anthology in contemporary metaphysics, check out the Metaphysics volume edited by Sosa and Kim and published in Blackwell's Philosophy Anthologies series.)  I'd recommend this anthology for classes aimed at advanced undergraduate students and for anyone with some philosophical background who's interested in the areas of contemporary metaphysics that it covers.	2004-05-30

And, as one would expect, it is an ideal text to be read in conjunction with Audi's book.  Almost all the subjects discussed in that book--the exceptions being moral and religious knowledge--are given corresponding sections in this anthology.  Nevertheless, I see no reason why this book needs to be used in conjunction with the other book.  It is a perfectly fine selection of readings for a person who wants a picture of some of the main areas of debate in epistemology.  For those who may be coming to the book without the background provided by reading Audi's introductory text, Huemer provides a short introduction to the subject matter of each chapter.  And it seems he has chosen historical selections that help the reader to understand the nature of the problems being discussed in each of the sections and why someone might think those problems are important ones.      <br />A signal virtue of this book is that it is helpful in introducing both contemporary and historical work in epistemology.  Is it somewhat paradoxical that almost half of a volume in a series called Routledge Contemporary Readings in Philosophy should consist of historical papers?  Somewhat so, perhaps, but it isn't all that surprising in a philosophy text.  For, as any student of philosophy can tell you, the history of philosophy isn't just history; it's also crucial for understanding the nature of the problems with which philosophers are dealing and the possible solutions that can be offered in response to those problems.  And this volume is quite good at introducing the history of philosophical thought about the nature, structure, and varieties of human knowledge.  Its coverage of the history of the subject in modern philosophy is especially good, as it includes several selections from Hume and from Reid, along with selections from Locke, Berkeley, Kant.  It also provides the reader with a introduction to the history of epistemological thought in the twentieth century, as it includes work by important figures from the earlier part of the century--Russell, Moore, and Ayer--and work by important mid-century figures, like Quine, Austin, and Goodman.  Huemer also throws in a few selections from the ancients.<br />Though this volume is not edited by the author of the Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy, it is intended as a companion volume to that book.  It takes its form Audi's introduction, in that it shifts the usual focus in introducing epistemology to the beginning student of the subject.  Instead of beginning with skeptical challenges and with general issues about the nature and structure of knowledge, this volume, like Audi's introduction, begins by focusing on more particular forms of knowledge and the ways in which we can acquire them.  Huemer has included sections on each of the following types of knowledge:  knowledge acquired through perception, through memory, through the testimony of others, through reason (i.e. and a priori knowledge), and through inductive inferences.  Most of the historical material is in these sections of the anthology--but all of these sections include at least a couple papers by contemporary figures as well.  <br />The latter half of the volume concerns the general issues about the nature and structure of knowledge on which contemporary epistemologists tend to focus their research.  Here the discussion is on the usual topics:  foundationalism vs. coherentism, skepticism, the analysis of knowledge.  These sections tend to include more readings than the sections discussed above, and thus, even though only half the anthology is concerned with these general issues, it still provides an excellent introduction to them.  The reader should note that there isn't any separate section on internalist vs. externalist accounts of knowledge, though this topic comes up inboth the section on skepticism and the section on the analysis of knowledge.<br />This is a very good anthology, and it's especially good for the price.  It covers quite a bit of material, and it covers it quite well.  The only possible problem one might have with this anthology is that its coverage of contemporary epistemology isn't as extensive as it might have been.  But, importantly, it is intended as an introduction to work in both contemporary and historical epistemology rather than as an exhaustive survey of the subject.  (For a more in-depth anthology in contemporary epistemology, check out the Epistemology volume edited by Sosa and Kim and published in Blackwell's Philosophy Anthologies series.)  <br />I'd recommend this anthology for classes aimed at undergraduate students and for anyone with some philosophical background who's interested in epistemology.	2004-05-30

It's a fine book for the beginner, as Williams does not assume that the reader will be coming to this book with any prior engagement with moral philosophy.  And it's worth reading for people with more philosophical background as well, since Williams doesn't shy away from presenting original thoughts about the issues.  Indeed, this is more of an original essay on some of the basic issues in moral philosophy than a summary of the various positions found in the literature.  So, for the reader looking for a summary of the competing positions in the field or an introduction to the literature on these topics, this book's lack of engagement with the existing literature makes it less than an ideal choice as an introductory text.  But if you'd rather introduce yourself to the subject of moral philosophy by seeing an especially competent person wrestling with the not insignificant task of arriving at a defensible moral view, this is the book for you.   <br />Behind much of what Williams says here is a skepticism about the usefulness of moral theory, and about the role that philosophy can play in elucidating issues about morality.  This is motivated not by a philosophically-based skepticism about morality itself--as a matter of fact, much of the book argues against such skepticism--but by a skepticism about the philosophers' ability to tell us much of substance about how we ought to moralize.  What he's especially quick to repudiate is the suggestion that philosophical thinking will enable us to arrive at a better conception of how we ought to think morally.  Williams suggests instead that we accept the complexity of ordinary moral thought and experience, and this is the source of one of his major strengths as a moral thinker:  that he refuses to engage in the sort of simplifying that all-too-often goes along with the systematization of ordinary moral thought that philosophers try to provide.  What we need instead, Williams thinks, is careful attention to everyday moral thinking, an attention undergirded by unwillingness to ignore the details, and the occasional messiness, of actual moral thought and feeling.    <br />But as admirable as this attitude towards ordinary moral thought is, it's not clear to me that it's the best sort of attitude for the author of an introductory text.  For this careful attention to detail can make the book somewhat difficult to follow at times, and I'm certain that the importance of some of what goes on here will be lost on the beginner.  Too often, the short chapters appear to end up bogged down in lengthy digressions; and, although the chapters can be naturally grouped together into small groups, the book as a whole doesn't have any obvious thread of argument to tie the various subjects together.  Still, given number and variety of introductory texts on these issues, it is arguable that this is a benefit of this book.  Williams hasn't dumbed-down his ideas and insights in order to make them accessible to everyone, and so the work here should prove stimulating and thought-provoking to anyone willing to follow his thought through its various twists and turns.  <br />What specific topics does Williams discuss?  He begins by considering certain reasons for being skeptical about morality in general.  The first such challenge is that presented by the amoralist, the person who wholly rejects moralizing as an activity.  And Williams treats this as a way to reveal what morality is--morality is whatever the amoralist is supposed to be rejecting.  He then considers the challenges posed by three forms of subjectivism:  (a) noncognitivism, the view that moral language expresses or describes attitudes or feelings; (b) a form of skepticism according to which we have no way of arriving at moral knowledge; and (c) nihilism, the view that there are no moral facts.Williams's main focus here is the project of &quot;defusing subjectivism&quot;:  that is, of showing that the subjectivist positions don't, and shouldn't, lead to a loss of confidence in morality or a loss of moral resolve.  While he thinks the project is largely successful, Williams doesn't think it allows the subjectivist to account for everything of importance to ordinary moral thought.  For, according to him, something remains unexplained by the subjectivist even after the defusing project, namely the sense that our moral views are intended to mirror some aspect of mind-independent reality.  And he also attacks a rather crude form of moral relativism that he thinks is especially influential as a reason for suspicion about the legitimacy of morality.  The basic idea of this relativism is that rightness and wrongness apply in virtue of the society a person is, and that this shows we ought to be tolerant of others.  Williams's primary argument against this view is that it's self-defeating in that it makes a non-relative virtue of tolerance and non-interference.<br />In the central part of the book Williams considers goodness and the nature of good human beings.  He begins by discussing the term 'good' and how it applies to things of particular types.  The most important conclusion here draws is that, at least with respect to certain types of things, there particular non-moral criteria related to application of 'good' for things of particular types.  And this, he thinks, provides us with a way of disputing the inviolability of the fact/value distinction.  When we make evaluative judgments about the goodness of many types of things, we have to rest our evaluative judgments on certain sorts of facts.  And he then considers the possibility of there being such criteria for moral evaluations, for evaluations of the goodness of human beings.  Are there such criteria for applying the term 'good' to human beings?  Williams first considers the possibility that we might discover such criteria by studying the nature of human persons and their distinctive capacities and abilities, and then the possibility that we might discover such criteria by studying nature of persons and their relations to God.  <br />In the book's penultimate chapter Williams discusses the point of morality, and particularly the connection between morality and human well-being.  Finally, he discusses utilitarianism as an example of a moral theory.	2004-05-26

Ever desirous of literary fame and dismayed by the lack of interest others had shown for his prior tome, Hume went back to the drawing board and attempted to present his philosophical system in a way that would be palatable to the reading public.  We should feel fortunate that he did so.  For, though the significant changes are in style and emphasis rather than substance, these books are a perfect introduction to Hume's thinking.  And while the shorter form did require some not insignificant cutting, most of what you find in the earlier book is presented here in a simpler, more accessible manner.  That's not to say that there is nothing new here; there is.  In particular, he considers some religious subjects (i.e. miracles and immortality) that he was unwilling to broach in the earlier work.   <br />The connecting thread here is an emphasis on grounding philosophical inquiry in an empirical account of human nature, and particularly of the human mind.  The first Enquiry is an account of Hume's take on the implications of the classical empiricism he inherited from Locke and Berkeley.  For Hume, as for the other classical empiricists, empiricism was primarily a psychological theory about the origin and content of our concepts.  (So empiricism, Hume thought, is a crucial element of any plausible account of the human mind.)  The central tenet of this theory is that our concepts are furnished by experience, which includes both sensory experience and introspection (i.e., the experience of our own mental states).  And the empiricists also agreed about the way we can justify our beliefs.  Some beliefs are true (or false) in virtue of the ideas they contained, and we can know their truth (or falsity) simply by thinking about them; other beliefs are true (or false) in virtue of how the external world is, and we can know their truth (or falsity) onlyby drawing on our experiences of the world.  According to Hume, all substantial conclusions about the world fall into this second category.  That is, the truth (or falsity) of all substantial claims about the existence and nature of things in the external world can be discovered only by checking those claims against the evidence of our senses.  <br />Here we seem Hume wielding this philosophy of mind in order to adjudicate disputes in metaphysics and epistemology.  Do you want to know whether something can be known?  Then think about the concepts in which it is expressed.  Could we come to know this by thinking about the meaning of our concepts?  Could we come to know it by going and looking or doing certain empirical tests?  If the answer to both these questions is no, then knowledge of this subject is an impossibility for us.  Do you want to know whether some claim of the metaphysicians is true or whether it even makes sense?  Consider the concepts they use to express their views.  Is there any way you could reduce the content of this concept to some experience?  If not, their claims are literally meaningless.    <br />This interpretation of Hume's project downplays his skepticism and emphasizes his professed intentions to provide a positive account of the operation of the human mind that appealed to nothing beyond the evidence of our senses.  According to proponents of this interpretation, Hume is most interested in a description of the operation of the human mind.  He's describing what human nature allows us to know and what it doesn't allow us to know.  Furthermore, he argues that our nature is such that, where it fails to provide us with the resources to acquire the knowledge we might want, it provides us with a natural habit of forming the right conclusions anyway.  Even though our nature limits our knowledge of the world, it ensures that we possess the habits of mind needed to make our way in the world.  Hume dubs all these habits of mind &quot;custom.&quot;<br />And I think this naturalistic interpretation of Hume's project provides an entry into the views he defends in the Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals.  Again, it's possible to interpret Hume's project in moral philosophy as a skeptical one.  The fact that he thinks morality is based in human sentiments show that he is, in some sense, a subjectivist about morality.  He doesn't think there is any plausible account of our moral thinking as based on reason or empirical inquiry alone.  Morality, then, is more a matter of feeling than a matter of thinking, observing, and reasoning.   But, importantly, Hume doesn't think this is indicative of some problem with morality, and so he doesn't understand himself to be undermining ordinary morality.  His aim is to expose the groundless pretensions of reason in order to make room for a wholly naturalistic account morality; it's not to show that morality doesn't have a firm basis.  For he does not think that morality would ideally be based on reason and empirical evidence rather than sentiment.  Rather, he thinks there is a sort of philosophical overreaching involved in trying to base morality on reason or empirical evidence as opposed to sentiment.  <br />But what is the relevant sentiment? According to Hume, it is a general sort of benevolence, of concern for others.  Our possessing such a feeling does not mean that we'll always set aside our own interest in the interest of others; nor does it mean that we are not largely self-interested.  It does, however, mean that we're not wholly self-interested, as we are motivated to do (and not do) certain things even when they do not affect our own interests and desires.  But what inspires these sentiments, and how exactly do they translate into moral judgments?  Morality, Hume argues, is based on sentiments of approbation and disapprobation that are prompted by a recognition of the connection between human actions, dispositions, etc. and what is in the best interest ofoneself and of mankind in general.  What we take to be virtues, Hume argues, are those dispositions that lead a person to perform actions tending to promote his own happiness and the happiness of others, whereas vices are dispositions that do the opposite.	2004-05-26

There's no doubt that his work in these areas is of signal importance, but I think a tendency to focus on these areas at the expense of his moral thinking suggests a somewhat misleading interpretation of what he's up to.  It's really only in his non-moral works that the picture of Hume as a radical skeptic has much plausibility. For here it seems clear that Hume's primary aim in his moral works is to ground his philosophical theses in a careful consideration of human nature; and it's also clear that he doesn't intend this to be a skeptical and debunking account of morality.  <BR>  <BR>Now, it's true that there are ways in which Hume is skeptical about a certain way of thinking about the origin and nature of morality.  The fact that he thinks morality is based in human sentiments show that he is, in some sense, a subjectivist about morality.  He doesn't think there is any plausible account of our moral thinking as based on reason or empirical inquiry alone.  Against the view that our awareness of moral distinctions is based on the exercise of reason, he argues that we do not figure out whether a person is virtuous or vicious, or an action good or bad, simply by thinking about things.  And against the view that our awareness of moral distinctions is empirical, he argues that we do not figure out which things possess which moral qualities by going out and looking or by anything else of this sort.  Morality, then, is more a matter of feeling than a matter of thinking, observing, and reasoning.   <br />Hume's basic argument for the conclusion that morality is based on human sentiment is that the essential practicality of morality requires us to understand its basis in this way.  Morality is about action, and neither reasoning nor ordinary empirical inquiry can be the source of our moral thinking since they are impotent to prompt us to action.  Reason does not motivate, and our moral judgments, concerns, sentiments are intimately connected to motivation.  Nor does recognition of the empirical facts motivate all on its own.  Motivation always requires the existence of certain conative states in addition to the relevant beliefs arrived at through reason and empirical inquiry.  So, in order to account for the practicality of morality (i.e. for the connection between morality and motivation), we need something to make us care about moral goodness and badness; and that something is to be found within the emotional part of our nature.  <br />But, importantly, Hume doesn't think this is indicative of some problem with morality, and so he doesn't understand himself to be undermining ordinary morality.  His aim is to expose the groundless pretensions of reason in order to make room for a wholly naturalistic account morality; it's not to show that morality doesn't have a firm basis.  For he does not think that morality would ideally be based on reason and empirical evidence rather than sentiment.  Rather, he thinks there is a sort of philosophical overreaching involved in trying to base morality on reason or empirical evidence as opposed to sentiment.  <br />So far, so good.  But what is the relevant sentiment? According to Hume, it is a general sort of benevolence, of concern for others.  At least where our own interests do not intrude on this feeling, we can take pleasure in the pleasure of others and we can be disturbed and pained by their pains and difficulties.  Our possessing such a feeling does not mean that we'll always set aside our own interest in the interest of others; nor does it mean that we are not largely self-interested.  It does, however, mean that we're not wholly self-interested, as we are motivated to do (and not do) certain things even when they do not affect our own interests and desires.  Such a feeling, Hume argues, must be the basis for the sort of general and unselfish concern for welfare of others that morality requires of us.And since this sentiment is a common component of human nature, it provides morality with a non-parochial basis.  The moral point of view, Hume argues, is one we take up when our sentiments and feelings about people and actions are based on a shared perspective based in human nature.  And since we share similar sentiments and sensibilities in virtue of our shared nature, morality possesses a sort of intersubjectivity.  <br />But what inspires these sentiments, and how exactly do they translate into moral judgments?  Morality, Hume argues, is based on sentiments of approbation and disapprobation that are prompted by a recognition of the connection between human actions, dispositions, etc. and what is in the best interest of oneself and of mankind in general.  What we take to be virtues, Hume argues, are those dispositions that lead a person to perform actions tending to promote his own happiness and the happiness of others, whereas vices are dispositions that do the opposite.  And this allows us to see the source of Hume's optimism.  For it is his view that being moral is in our own interest, and in the interest of others.  The morally good person is one whose actions are for the good of himself and for the good of others, and this is why we approve of such people.  This is why we find them pleasant, why we enjoy their company, and why we think it's a good thing to be virtuous.  So this is anything but a dark, self-denying account of morality and our moral obligations.  Morality is not a set of chains holding us back from realizing ourselves, from expressing our true nature.  Given what our nature is actually like, Hume claims, there is no need to understand morality as involving self-abnegation for nothing more than self-abnegation's sake. <br />If I had to recommend a single book in moral philosophy to the general reader, I suppose it would be this one.  There may be greater works of moral philosophy--Kant's works and Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, for instance--but those are works for the philosopher and this is a book for everyone.  It's wise, accessible, inspiring, beautifully written, occasionally quite funny, and largely convincing.	2004-05-26

Some beliefs are true (or false) in virtue of the ideas they contained, and we can know their truth (or falsity) simply by thinking about them; other beliefs are true (or false) in virtue of how the external world is, and we can know their truth (or falsity) onlyby drawing on our experiences of the world.  According to Hume, all substantial conclusions about the world fall into this second category.  That is, the truth (or falsity) of all substantial claims about the existence and nature of things in the external world can be discovered only by checking those claims against the evidence of our senses.  <br />Here we seem Hume wielding this philosophy of mind in order to adjudicate disputes in metaphysics and epistemology.  Do you want to know whether something can be known?  Then think about the concepts in which it is expressed.  Could we come to know this by thinking about the meaning of our concepts?  Could we come to know it by going and looking or doing certain empirical tests?  If the answer to both these questions is no, then knowledge of this subject is an impossibility for us.  Do you want to know whether some claim of the metaphysicians is true or whether it even makes sense?  Consider the concepts they use to express their views.  Is there any way you could reduce the content of this concept to some experience?  If not, their claims are literally meaningless.    <br />This interpretation of Hume's project downplays his skepticism and emphasizes his professed intentions to provide a positive account of the operation of the human mind that appealed to nothing beyond the evidence of our senses.  According to proponents of this interpretation, Hume is most interested in a description of the operation of the human mind.  He's describing what human nature allows us to know and what it doesn't allow us to know.  Furthermore, he argues that our nature is such that, where it fails to provide us with the resources to acquire the knowledge we might want, it provides us with a natural habit of forming the right conclusions anyway.  Even though our nature limits our knowledge of the world, it ensures that we possess the habits of mind needed to make our way in the world.  Hume dubs all these habits of mind &quot;custom.&quot;<br />And I think this naturalistic interpretation of Hume's project provides an entry into the views he defends in the Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals.  Again, it's possible to interpret Hume's project in moral philosophy as a skeptical one.  The fact that he thinks morality is based in human sentiments show that he is, in some sense, a subjectivist about morality.  He doesn't think there is any plausible account of our moral thinking as based on reason or empirical inquiry alone.  Morality, then, is more a matter of feeling than a matter of thinking, observing, and reasoning.   But, importantly, Hume doesn't think this is indicative of some problem with morality, and so he doesn't understand himself to be undermining ordinary morality.  His aim is to expose the groundless pretensions of reason in order to make room for a wholly naturalistic account morality; it's not to show that morality doesn't have a firm basis.  For he does not think that morality would ideally be based on reason and empirical evidence rather than sentiment.  Rather, he thinks there is a sort of philosophical overreaching involved in trying to base morality on reason or empirical evidence as opposed to sentiment.  <br />But what is the relevant sentiment? According to Hume, it is a general sort of benevolence, of concern for others.  Our possessing such a feeling does not mean that we'll always set aside our own interest in the interest of others; nor does it mean that we are not largely self-interested.  It does, however, mean that we're not wholly self-interested, as we are motivated to do (and not do) certain things even when they do not affect our own interests and desires.  But what inspires these sentiments, and how exactly do they translate into moral judgments?  Morality, Hume argues, is based on sentiments of approbation and disapprobation that are prompted by a recognition of the connection between human actions, dispositions, etc. and what is in the best interest ofoneself and of mankind in general.  What we take to be virtues, Hume argues, are those dispositions that lead a person to perform actions tending to promote his own happiness and the happiness of others, whereas vices are dispositions that do the opposite.	2004-05-26
US	23395896	R33ABGT6URG7XA	0198751729	710263832	A Treatise of Human Nature (Oxford Philosophical Texts)	Books	5	110	125	N	N	The Greatest Achievement of Our Greatest Philosopher	Before he chose to diddle away his later years writing book after book of history, playing house with Rousseau, annoying the religious authorities, and forging a lasting reputation as an all-around good guy, Hume dedicated his youth to writing the this book, which is nothing less than the single greatest work of philosophy in the English language.  Indeed, I don't think there are even any other close competitors for that title.  Naturally, then, this work was largely ignored during Hume's lifetime.  <br />Notwithstanding the widely told, and somewhat accurate, standard story of the history of modern philosophy according to which Kant's rearguard action in response to Hume is the culmination of the modern period, I think that this book rather than Kant's First Critique is where it's at.  Certainly, no book of modern philosophy compares to this complex, intricately argued, inspiring, maddening, imaginative, iconoclastic, encyclopedic tome when it comes to influence on contemporary philosophers in the Anglo-American analytic tradition.  And while it's true that Kant's system is almost unparalleled in the breadth of its influence, defenders of the traditional story of modern philosophy need to remember that 'almost'.  For it seems to me that, among the moderns, Hume got there first.  He, and not Kant, is the first modernist whose importance is manifest in all the main areas of philosophy:  epistemology (skepticism and the problem of induction), metaphysics (causation, personal identity, etc.), philosophy of mind (action theory, rationality) meta-ethics (meta-ethical subjectivism, proto-noncognitivism, reason vs. emotions, moral psychology, etc.), normative ethics (importance of benevolence, justice as an artificial virtue, etc.).  <br />Want some evidence of Hume's pervasive influence?  It's not just that everyone working in this tradition has read Hume, though they have.  Nor is it just that Hume's stamp is all over the concerns and positions of contemporary philosophers, though it is.  Nor is it just that Hume's influence is celebrated (or bemoaned) by pretty much every philosopher you come across, though that's true as well.  No, the true measure of his intellectual ascendancy is that there's a position dubbed &quot;Humean&quot; in pretty much every area of philosophy, and, depending on one's view of the topic, it's either the obviously correct view--it was Hume's position, after all!--or a pernicious heresy for which no good arguments have been provided and for which there isn't good reason to think it was even Hume's actual position.  You know you've made it when both the defenders of the status quo and those who can't abide that status quo claim you as their own.<br />Why is Hume so important?  I think there are two reasons, each corresponding to one of the influential interpretations of Hume's work as a whole.  The first interpretation of Hume's corpus sees it as shot through with a radical skepticism about anything and everything, and corresponding to this interpretation is a conception of Hume's importance as consisting in his occupying the place of the philosopher opponent of common sense par excellence.  Hume, according to this interpretation, takes the empiricism of Locke, which in his hands looks like nothing so much as self-conscious common sense, and wields it as a weapon against more or less everything we tend to believe.  That is, we should see Hume as taking up the empiricism of Locke and Berkeley and pushes it to its logical conclusion:  a thoroughgoing skepticism.  Think you can know there is a mind-independent world of physical objects?  Think you're a single person who persists through time?  Think things stand in causal relationships to one another?  Think you can know whether the sun will explode tomorrow?  You should think again, Hume says, and he's happy to show you why empiricism leads to this conclusion.  So, if this is right, the importance of Hume's project consists in its status as a for rationalists, for non-skeptics of all stripes, and for all ordinary, right-thinking folks.<br />Now, undoubtedly, there's some truth in the stereotypical view of Hume as the young radical who took empiricism to its implausible limits.  But this isn't where his true importance lies--at least not among contemporary philosophers.  What has been most influential among contemporary exponents of the Anglo-American analytic tradition is Hume's unrepentant and radical naturalism.  This interpretation of his project downplays Hume's skepticism and emphasizes his professed intentions to provide a positive account of the operation of the human mind that appealed to nothing beyond the evidence of our senses.  According to proponents of this interpretation, Hume is most interested in a description of the operation of the human mind.  He's describing what human nature allows us to know and what it doesn't allow us to know.  Here Hume's importance consists not in his providing a challenge to the views of philosophers and of the hoi polloi, but in his providing us with a model of how philosophy should be done.    <br />I feel that I've strayed somewhat from the topic of the book here, but I suppose that was inevitable.  It would, of course, have been pointless to attempt to summarize Hume's arguments, or even his conclusions, in a review of this length.  The only summary of this book's content that the reader needs is this:  Hume discusses nearly everything of importance in philosophy, and his discussions of nearly every issue reveal an unsurpassed (and rarely equaled) level of philosophical brilliance.<br />To whom do I recommend this book?  The answer, in short, is everyone.  If you're even slightly interested in philosophy, you simply can't get by without reading this.  If you're at all interested in the history of ideas, you need to read this.  If you're the slightest bit curious about our modern worldview and its origin, it would be a good idea for you to read this.  If you're interestedenough in Hume to have come across this review and read it to this point, you'll want to read this.<br />Concerning editions of this book.  I wish Amazon would separate the various editions of this book so I could review them separately, but they haven't.  I'd recommend either the edition jointly edited by the Nortons and published in the Oxford Philosophical Texts series or the Selby-Bigge edition, which was for some time the standard edition of the Treatise.	2004-05-26

Books	4	14	14	N	N	Meta-Ethics for the Beginner	This book is a very nice, and very basic, introduction to meta-ethics, the field of philosophy studying the metaphysical, epistemological, semantic, and psychological issues concerning morality.  Though it might help to have had some prior philosophy, it should be accessible to anyone who is interested in what philosophers might have to say about the these issues.  Shafer-Landau has decided to introduce meta-ethics through an extended argument concerning a single topic:  the objectivity (or lack thereof) of morality.  And while this is only one of the issues that meta-ethicists discuss, it's perhaps the single most important and general issue in the field.  <br />Shafer-Landau writes a clear and accessible style, and his book isn't jargon-laden.  He is, moreover, up-front about the nature of his arguments, what he's assuming, and where people might respond to his arguments.  He doesn't expect the reader to piece his arguments together for herself or to expend a great deal of effort trying to figure out just what he means.  He makes his points lucidly and succinctly, and then he moves on to the next one.  And despite its brief length, this book is packed full of interesting and important arguments both for and against the objectivity of ethics.  (There's also a helpful short appendix that summarizes the main arguments of the book and Shafer-Landau's analysis of them.)  Importantly, though, this is not a work covering the literature on this topic.  Shafer-Landau refers to other philosophers only occasionally, and he tends to refer to major historical figures when he does refer to philosophers.  Nor is this a work covering the various positions that have been defended in meta-ethics.  It introduces meta-ethics by developing and defending a position on a particular topic in meta-ethics rather than by presenting and criticizing all the views that are of importance in the field.  And this is the source of my only substantial criticism of this book. It would be nice if Shafer-Landau had engaged with the literature a little more.  While this isn't such a major problem, it would have been nice if the book could work as a entry to the literature on the topic.  Indeed, the book doesn't even include a guide to further reading on these topics, and so it provides no suggestions about where the reader might go from here.<br />Now for something about the relevant philosophical issues here.  First, the most obvious question:  What would it be for morality to be objective?  According to Shafer-Landau, it would be for there to be right and wrong, good and bad, etc. independent of what human beings think or feel or desire.  And Shafer-Landau's aim in this book is to argue that morality is indeed objective.  What would someone who argues against this position think?  What would it be for morality to be subjective?  Shafer-Landau considers three different versions of subjectivism:  nihilism, the view that there are no moral facts of any type; subjectivism, the view that the moral facts are constituted by each individual's beliefs or feelings or desires; and relativism, the view that the moral facts are constituted by each group's practices or conventions.  All of this material is presented in the first two chapters of this book.  The first chapter sketches the issue concerning the objectivity of ethics, and the second presents these positions.<br />The rest of the book is divided into two parts.  The first part argues against the forms of subjectivism described above (and thereby presents a prima facie case for objectivism), and the second part argues against certain important objections to objectivism.  The primary form of argument Shafer-Landau uses in the first part is that various types of subjectivism can't account for our ordinary conception of the status and nature of morality.  Here he discusses several traditional lines of argument:  that subjectivism allows for no notion of moral error, that subjectivism doesn't allow us to compare the quality of distinct moral views, that subjectivism can't make sense of the possibility of moral progress, that subjectivism isn't a good way to promote tolerance (and indeed subjectivists may not be able to argue against the intolerant, that subjectivism can't account for the nature of moral disagreement, and that subjectivism may in fact be an inconsistent position.  Each of these objections is considered in a separate chapter, and each chapter--most of them less than ten pages long--discusses how each objection affects all three of the forms subjectivism discussed above.  <br />The upshot of the first part is supposed to be that morality certainly does not seem to be subjective in the way these theories tell us, and so we have some reason to think that subjectivism is false and that some sort of objectivism is true.  But how could objectivism be true?  What could an objective moral position be exactly?  Answering these questions is Shafer-Landau's aim in the second part of the book.  He begins with a short chapter arguing that objectivism avoids all of the problems he developed for subjectivism.  However, he admits that this doesn't constitute a knock-down argument for objectivism, as there are many arguments for the conclusion that objectivism isn't and couldn't be true.  The rest of the second part is intended to undermine various traditional and important arguments that morality isn't objective, and so the rest of the book is largely defensive.  He considers the following arguments:  that objectivism is undermined by the existence and persistence of moral disagreement, that objective moral standards would have to depend on God, that objective moral values are inconsistent with a naturalistic and scientific worldview, that objectivists can't account for our ability to acquire moral knowledge, and that we have no good reason to be moral.  Again, each of these arguments is considered in a separate chapter.  <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in whatphilosophers might have to say about the objectivity of morality, and to anyone who is coming to meta-ethics for the very first time.  This would be a fine book for an introductory course on these issues.  It's well-argued; it gives the reader a sense of how to argue about these issues; it would be accessible to someone with no background in this area; and its chapters are brief enough that there is quite a bit one could say to clarify its arguments, consider their nuances, and examine their cogency.	2004-05-25

This book covers her work from the 70s to the 90s (and her book Natural Goodness).  Along with the earlier collection Virtues and Vices, this provides us with a picture of a career of penetrating thought about the central issues of meta-ethics and normative ethics.<br />Several areas of Foot's research are represented here.  First up are her historical interests.  These are the same interests that showed up in the papers in Virtues and Vices:  Nietzsche's immoralism and the foundations of contemporary noncognitivism and moral subjectivism in the classical empiricists and their theories of mind.  Next up are her interests in normative ethics.  The primary aspect of her research in normative ethics that is covered in this collection is Foot's anti-consequentialism.  According to consequentialists, maximizing goodness is fundamental point of moral action.  Foot's argument against consequentialism is that we can't make sense of this non-moral notion of goodness.  In particular, she claims that we possess no notion of a good state of affairs that isn't defined through its relation to certain moral virtues.  Consequently, there is no way to coherently formulate the main consequentialist idea--the idea that we ought morally to always maximize the good.<br />Now for Foot's meta-ethical papers.  Included here are two essays about moral dilemmas and appeals to them as arguments against cognitivism.  There is a moral dilemma, in the relevant sense, whenever it is the case that agents have conflicting moral obligations, when they are under multiple moral demands but cannot fulfill them all.  In cases of moral dilemmas it appears that there is something to be said for the both the judgment that the person acts rightly and the judgment that the person acts wrongly.  Why is this supposed to be a problem for cognitivism?  Because cognitivists claim that moral judgments express beliefs, and it doesn't seem that we treat conflicting beliefs in this way.  When two beliefs conflict, we think that one of them must ultimately be rejected.  We do, however, think that there can be conflicts between desires that seem similar to what we have in the case of a moral dilemma:  when we have conflicting desires, we can continue to desire both things even though we recognize that these desires cannot both be satisfied.  Moral judgments, then, look moral like desires than beliefs, and this suggests a sort of noncognitivism.  In both papers Foot argues that this isn't correct, and that moral dilemmas provide no evidence against cognitivism.<br />As interesting as the material mentioned above is, I think the best papers in this collection are those concerned with the objectivity of morality.  Foot's views about the objectivity of morality have changed considerably over time, and this collection provides evidence of those changes.  The collection opens with a pair of papers in which Foot is at her most skeptical about the objectivity of morality, and it shows her gradual move towards a neo-Aristotelian position on which morality is robustly objective.<br />The collection opens with &quot;Morality and Art.&quot; She never abandons a form of cognitivism in this paper (or any other in the collection), nor does she reject her contention some moral claims may be strictly provable.  Nevertheless, Foot tentatively considers the possibility that there are significant elements of fiction in our ordinary conception of morality.  The first element of fiction is that morality is thoroughly objective.  While some moral claims are strictly provable and some evidence must be considered by all moralists, there may be a significant amount of 'play' in the system.  The second element of fiction is that moral obligations provide people with categorical reasons for action:  that is, with reasons for action that are independent of their particular interests or desires.  Foot thinks that it is possible that for someone to be under a moral obligation and yet have no reason to act morally.  For a person's moral reasons depend on that person's interests and desires, and those interests and desires may make moral action irrational for her.<br />The third area of fiction is one that Foot develops in her paper &quot;Moral Relativism.&quot;  According to Foot, there is an area for choice with respect to some of our moral standards.  Some moral claims are objective and non-relative, and yet some may be relative.  It is unclear that Foot ever comes out and endorses a form of moral relativism, but she is clearly interested in formulating a defensible version of relativism and suggesting why someone might consider it a tenable position about some moral judgments.  Hers is a limited sort of appraiser relativism:  it claims that certain moral claims may admit of truth and falsity only relative to the standards accepted in the group of the person making the moral judgment.<br />However, in the later papers &quot;Rationality and Virtue&quot; and &quot;Does Moral Subjectivism Rest on a Mistake?&quot;, Foot abandons most of the positions discussed above.  In these papers she argues that she had formerly failed to understand the connection between morality and reasons for actions because she held a false view about the nature of practical rationality.  There is, she claims, no need to fit morality into a general non-moral conception of practical rationality, of what agents have reasons to do.  Instead, she thinks appreciating moral reasons is best understood as part of practical rationality.  To ignore moral reasons is to be irrational, as being sensitive to moral reasons for one's actions is part of what it is to be practically rational.  But why think there is such a connection between reasons for action and morality?  The central idea is to focus on moral virtues and the ways in which they are beneficial to human beings who possess them.  We begin by looking at human nature and the qualities of members of the human species, and we see that certain things are naturally good for human beings when we understand them as social organisms.  Possessing the moral virtues, Foot argues, is best understood as a good of this sort.  Given the needs of beings like us, possessing the virtues is a requirement for flourishing, for leading a good life.  Hence being virtuous is naturally good for human beings.  Hence human beings have good reason to act virtuously.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in meta-ethics.r someone to be under a moral obligation and yet have no reason to act morally.

It covers the most important papers from Foot's in the period from the 50s to the 70s, and it includes several classics of twentieth-century meta-ethics (e.g. &quot;Moral Arguments,&quot; &quot;Moral Beliefs,&quot; and &quot;Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives&quot;).<br />While Foot's most important work has been in meta-ethics, this collection includes some quality papers in normative ethics.  The opening paper, &quot;Virtues and Vices,&quot; is one of the works that helped to resurrect virtue ethics as a research program in contemporary analytic philosophy.  Also included are &quot;Abortion and the Doctrine of Double Effect,&quot; and Foot's paper on euthanasia.  There are also a couple of papers on the history of philosophy, one on Hume and one on Nietzsche.  These historical concerns reflect the two major projects that have been central to Foot's meta-ethical thinking throughout her career:  (i) defending a form of cognitivism against various forms of noncognitivism, and (ii) understanding the relation between moral obligations and reasons for action.  She is interested in the classical empiricists (and especially Hume) as a source of contemporary assumptions about reasons and psychology that lead to noncognitivism, and she is concerned with Nietzsche's challenges to morality and their relevance to thinking about the connection between moral obligation and reasons for action.<br />And Foot's two fundamental concerns in meta-ethics--cognitivism vs. noncognitivism, and the connection between reasons and moral obligations--are represented by several papers in this collection.  Several of the most important papers here (viz. &quot;Moral Arguments,&quot; &quot;Moral Beliefs,&quot; and &quot;Goodness and Choice&quot;) attack noncognitivism, and especially the sorts of noncognitivism accepted by Stevenson and Hare.  In several papers she questions Hume's Law according to which one cannot infer an 'ought' from an 'is'.  In particular, she wants to argue that there are descriptive requirements on what counts as evidence for and against moral views, and that it is impossible to understand certain claims with the formal components or attitudinal concomitants that noncognitivists claim characterize ethical discourse as moral claims.  Moreover, she claims that it is unclear that there is any sort of feeling or attitude or desire that must be connected with a judgment for that judgment to be considered a moral judgment.  So it's unclear that those judgments express such feelings or attitudes or desires.<br />Here her aim is to argue for a form of cognitivism.  Pace Hare (and his purely formal account of moral language), there are content constraints on what counts as a moral opinion.  And pace emotivists and expressivists, having a certain attitude or an emotion is neither necessary nor sufficient for making a moral claim.  Minimally, Foot argues, moral opinions must be concerned with human good and harm, and this rules out certain views as moral views--even if those views have the form of universalizable prescriptions or are accompanied by whatever attitudes a noncognitivist considers to be distinctively moral.  If you want to engage in genuine moral discussion, you have to accept facts about human good and harm as evidence in the argument.  If you ignore such evidence when it is brought forward, you are opting out of the moral debate.  Indeed, it is unclear that we can understand a person who isn't responsive to such evidence as putting forward and defending moral opinions at all.<br />This collection also allows the reader to observe the evolution of Foot's views about the connection between moral obligations and reasons for action.  The problem with which she is dealing arises from the apparent inconsistency of the following three claims:  (a) moral obligations provide everyone with reasons for action; (b) different people have different desires and interests; and (c) people'sreasons for actions depend on their desires and interests.  There is a prima facie tension here:  moral obligations are supposed to provide everyone with reasons for action, and yet the basis of reasons for action are different from person to person.<br />Now, these three claims aren't straightforwardly inconsistent.  It is possible that moral obligations will have a sort of connection to different people's desires and interests that allows them to provide everyone with reasons for action, even though different people have different desires and interests.  Being just, for example, may be to everyone's advantage, irrespective of their particular desires and interests.  Still, it appears to be against many people's desires and interests; it appears that being just often requires a person to put aside her own desires and interests in order to do the right thing.  But one might take on the project of showing that, notwithstanding the appearance to the contrary, being just really will contribute to everyone's diverse desires and interest.  This would provide some evidence for the view that everyone has reason to act justly.<br />Foot's appears to have been somewhat sympathetic to this sort of project when she wrote &quot;Moral Beliefs&quot;--or, at least, she was willing to consider the possibility that this project might be successful.  But she gradually became much more skeptical about the ordinary view that moral obligations always provide people with reasons for action.  This skepticism received its fullest expression in &quot;Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives.&quot;  There she held that it may be the case that only those who have a desire to be moral have good reason to, say, be just in all cases.  She thought that there may be immoralists, people who simply don't care about morality, for whom moral obligations do not provide reasons for action in many (or even all) cases.  We can still say that these people are morally obligation to be just, but they don't have reasons to be just since they lack the relevant interests and desires that make it the case that most people have reason to act justly in most cases.  (In her more recent work Foot has opted for a different response to these issues.  She now thinks that moral obligations do in fact provide people with reasons for action, but she denies that reasons for action are based on people's desires and interests.  For more on this, see her more recent collection Moral Dilemmas and her book Natural Goodness.)<br />I can't recommend this book enough.

For more on this, see her more recent collection Moral Dilemmas and her book Natural Goodness.)  <br />I can't recommend this book enough.  Go out and buy it if you're interested in contemporary meta-ethics.	2004-05-22

I consider this Hare's best book.  And, as a matter of fact, the first part of this book summarizes the main conclusions about moral language that Hare reached in the first part of The Language of Morals.  But I think this is the better presentation of Hare's position.  The most important difference is that his interests here are broader:  he summarizes his views about moral language, he attempts to account for moral reasoning, and he moves toward the normative ethical position he defends in Moral Thinking.  <br />The book opens with a section summarizing Hare's purely formal account of moral language.  He argues that claims are moral if and only if they take the form of universalizable prescriptions.  They are universalizable in that an agent must be willing to apply them to all cases that are alike in all the relevant respects.  They are prescriptive in that they provide guidance about how to act and they are necessarily connected to motivation.  <br />Hare then considers a single issue--the nature of moral arguments--in the remainder of the book.  This is an extended response to a problem that noncognitivists are usually alleged to face:  that they rule out the possibility of any sort of rational moral debate because their views don't allow a notion of good reasons for making a moral judgment.  Hare argues that he can account for the rationality of moral argument.  His fundamental move is to appeal to the universalizability of moral claims, and to argue that this provides us with a way to criticize people for a sort of inconsistency.  If you make a judgment about a person in one situation, then you have to make the same judgment about anyone else in a situation that is alike in all relevant respects.  And, importantly, you must make the same judgment about yourself if you were in that person's situation.  Hare thinks this is important since it provides us with a way to argue with people about moral issues.  We can discover and remove inconsistencies in our own views and in the views of others, and this will involve a sort of rational discussion that can lead to progress.  Crucially for Hare, this is supposed to be a logical feature of moral language; it is not based on some substantive moral view, but on what moral language means.  <br />How is this supposed to work?  In the simplest case (i.e. a case where we're dealing with only two people), the person making the moral judgment about the other is supposed to use her powers of imagination to place herself in the position of the person she's judging.  Now, these judgments are universalizable, and so they apply to everyone in the very same situation.  So, in assuming she's in the situation, she would have to be willing to have the same judgment applied to herself.  She would have to say about the imagined case that she would prescribe that she receive the punishment in it.  But she may not be able to sincerely say this, given her actual inclinations, and so she either has to abandon the original judgment or opt out of making the full moral judgment in some other way.  And when we consider more complex cases (i.e. cases involving the interests of many people), Hare thinks this method of reasoning results in something resembling utilitarianism.  The individuals and their particular situations drop out through the universalizability requirement, and we have to prescribe moral judgments taking all their interests into account.  <br />And Hare thinks we have good reason to believe that a continued application of this method will lead to a significant convergence in moral opinions.  The method rests on (i) the non-moral facts, (ii) people's inclinations (what they want, what they are willing to accept happening to them, etc.), (iii) their imaginative abilities, and (iv) the logic of moral claims.  The facts are common and disagreement about them can be gradually removed, inclinations are similar from person to person, and imaginative abilities can be trained.  Since the logic of moral claims commits us to a sort of universalizability, we have enough here to reach a lot of moral agreement.  But there is no guarantee that the convergence will eventually be complete, for even people who know all the facts and have adequate imaginative abilities may have odd inclinations.  Even if two people share all the relevant info., employ their imaginative abilities successfully, and appropriate use moral language, they may disagree in their inclinations to such an extent that they may be willing to accept moral principles that conflict.<br />This is a problem Hare tries to deal with in many chapters.  He first tries to explain the persistence of these disagreement, and he thinks they are to be explained by the fact that some people base moral judgments on their deals.  People have ideals if they have certain principles, certain grounds for moral judgment, that do not depend on satisfying desires, aims, goals, etc.  These people may be willing to prescribe that their moral judgment should apply to everyone--even if it would lead to disregarding their interests if they were in the situation of the person being judged.  This is the problem of the person Hare calls the fanatic, the person who holds his ideals come what may.  He acknowledges that such people seem to result in a problem for his view, since his style of argument can't really get started against such a person.  What is his response?  First, he wants to argue that such people are extremely rare, and that normal people usually don't have pure ideals.  Provided that we can get most people to really think through what they'd be saying here, most of them are such that they wouldn't prescribe that their own interests be ignored in the relevant cases.  But what of those who remain steadfast in their judgments?  In short, Hare's response is that we can'texpect a moral theory to help us argue everyone into a respectable position.	2004-05-22
US	23395896	R28AN7KHMRMYFZ	0198810776	952389825	The Language of Morals (Oxford Paperbacks)	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Hare's Project:  Step One	The Language of Morals is a central text in twentieth-century metaethics, and it should be read by everyone studying the subject.  This the first step in Hare's attempt to develop a form of noncognitivism that accounts for the phenomena of ordinary moral language and argument, and it's been a major influence on all subsequent forms of noncognitivism.  But the methods and concerns here are somewhat different than those of contemporary meta-ethicists.  This is a text from the high tide of linguistic philosophy, and so Hare is of the opinion that metaethics has one subject--the nature and structure of moral language.  <br />The central contention of this book is that moral language should be understood as one form of prescriptive language.  What is characteristic of prescriptive language is its connection to action:  there is a conceptual connection between how an agent uses prescriptive language and her motives to act in certain ways.  <br />The book starts with the least complicated form of prescriptive language:  the language of imperatives.  In the first part Hare discusses the proper analysis of imperative language, how we can see it as meaningful, how we can reason about imperatives, how imperatives can stand in logical relations to one another, etc.  By showing us certain things about the logic of imperatives, Hare hopes to suggest that a noncognitivist can meet certain traditional objections to her view:  that it cannot allow for any sort of moral reasoning, that it cannot allow for logical relations between moral sentences, that it turns ethical language into mere irrational &quot;sounding off,&quot; etc.  <br />In the second (on &quot;good&quot;) and third (on &quot;ought&quot;) parts of the book he moves on to his substantive account of evaluative language.  Here Hare offers a purely formal account of moral language according to which there are no content restrictions on what can count as a moral claim.  What is the relevant form?  According to Hare, moral claims are universalizable prescriptions.  They are universalizable in that an agent must be willing to apply them to all cases that are alike in all the relevant respects.  They are prescriptive because sincere moral claims always imply imperatives and sincerely accepting an imperative involves being motivated to act on it.  <br />Hare thinks this purely formal account of moral language has some major benefits.  First, understanding moral language as prescriptive allows us to understand the connection between morality and action.  This allows us to account for the fact that we can explain people's actions by appealing to their moral opinions, and it allow us to account for the fact that we think people are being insincere if their own behavior is inconsistent with the moral views they express.   Second, it allows us to interpret people with very different moral views as disagreeing with one another.  If moral claims were partially defined by their descriptive content, people with radically different views would be talking past one another and we'd be unable to understand some genuine moral disagreements as disagreements.  <br />Nevertheless, Hare does not think there is a total disconnect between moral and non-moral language.  One way the moral and non-moral are connected is that moral evaluations are made in response to non-moral facts.  People appeal to non-moral facts as a reason to hold certain moral evaluations, and thus must do so since there is a supervenience requirement that universalizability places on moral judgments:  necessarily, if you judge that something is good, you must judge that anything similar in all relevant non-moral respects is good.  Still, though, Hare denies that we can infer the moral facts from the non-moral facts; he denies that a person's judgments about the non-moral facts ever entail judgments about the moral facts.  In addition to certain views about the non-moral facts, a person has to accept certain principles about the connection between the moral and the non-moral in order to draw a moral conclusion.  <br />And there is also a connection between the descriptive and evaluative meaning expressed in moral claims.  Given widely accepted standards, the use of moral language will often convey non-moral information.  There can be a close connection between making certain moral claims and making non-moral claims, and this is something people know.  So, at least in particular groups, there are descriptive criteria for the application of moral language.  Part of the information conveyed in moral discussion, then, is descriptive meaning--but it is secondary to the evaluative meaning.  And it is always possible for the moral language to retain its evaluative meaning, the primary component, through a change in its descriptive meaning.  <br />Hare develops lots of interesting arguments as he presents and defends this conception of moral language.  I don't have the space to discuss much here, but I'll mention one thing.  Hare makes an attempt to resurrect something like Moore's open question argument.  He wants to argue that there cannot be an analysis of claims about goodness into non-moral terms.  Why not?  Claims about goodness have a commending function that is lost in such analyses.  To say that something is good is to commend this, but naturalistic theories cannot explain this.  These are theories according to which &quot;good&quot; is defined in terms of natural language (e.g. &quot;is good&quot; means &quot;leads to the greatest happiness for the greatest number&quot;).  The problem with all such theories is that it remains possible to think the naturalistic description fits and yet not find this a commendation of the object.  So the element of commendation in uses of &quot;good,&quot; which is central to its meaning, drops out.  Hence all such analyses of &quot;good&quot; are unacceptable.    <br />Despite Hare's avowed intention of writing a book that introduces the subject of ethics, this isn't a book I'd suggest to someone without some background in meta-ethics.  This book is clearly written and covers a lot of ground, but it's primarily composed of the sort of painstaking linguistic analysis that tends to be extremely dry, and even pedantic, as well as slow to get to the point.  Indeed, I don't even think this is the best place to start if you want to study Hare's own views.  For the newcomer to Hare, I'd recommend beginning with his more recent Sorting out Ethics and then reading Freedom and Reason, which is more interesting and wide-ranging in its discussions of issues in meta-ethics.	2004-05-21

(I'll try to get this one removed.)<br />Still, I can say a bit more about this book.  This isn't a technical book, and I think it should be accessible to anyone interested in general philosophical issues.  It's not an easy read--it's subtle and Nagel is sometimes a bit obscure--but it's not forbiddingly difficult and it doesn't presume that the reader is as knowledgeable about contemporary philosopohy as its author is.  However, that's not to say that this is a book that fails to engage with the literature on these topics.  It's clear that Nagel is familiar with the relevant contemporary work on these topics, and the book is accessible enough that it might server as a high-level introdution to the more technical literature in these areas.  And it certainly provides you with a way to see the technical literature as concerned with fundamental human concerns.<br />Also, it's somewhat inspiring to see someone take on a grand project of this sort.  Philosophy is becoming an increasingly specialized discipline, and it's nice to see someone trying to fit a lot of what is going on into a general picture of the origins and nature of genuine philosophical problems.	2004-05-17

It covers relativism in two areas:  general conceptual and epistemological relativism, and moral relativism.  Lots of the papers here are of signal importance, and many of them have been extremely influential.  Still, though, it is somewhat difficult to see a lot of connection between the two general topics.  And the reader should note that this is not an anthology for the neophyte.  For the most part, these are sophisticated articles written by professional philosophers and for professional philosophers<br />Krausz and Meiland begin with a general introduction that introduces the topic.  (There are also short introductions to the paper that summarize their main claims and relate their contents to the contents of other essays.)  The introduction says something about the significance of relativism in contemporary culture, and a little bit about the history of relativism in philosophy.  It is, in effect, a general attempt to motivate the issues here by pointing the facts of conceptual and moral diversity, and explaining how relativism is one, albeit only one, of the possible responses to these facts about diversity.  Basically, the relativist's response is to deny the reality of a single truth here.  There is what is true-for-them and what is true-for-us, and that's all there is to it.<br />The first section of the anthology, the section on what the authors call &quot;cognitive relativism,&quot; includes papers about a very radical and very general form of relativism.  This is the sort of relativism according to which different groups (or individuals) possess different general conceptual schemes, different groups of concepts in which they think and speak.  And, the relativist claims, there is no way to determine which is the one correct conceptual scheme.  Indeed, they may think the suggestion that there is one privileged conceptual scheme doesn't even make sense.  Why?  Because they believe the truth and falsity apply to judgments only relative to a particular conceptual scheme.  The facts are what they are only in some scheme or another, and there is no standpoint outside any framework from which we can determine which is the one correct conceptual scheme.  This leads to a relativism about all our thought and talk about the world.  <br />In the first reading of this section, Nelson Goodman defends a relativism of this variety.  Then there are two papers attacking it:  Maurice Mandelbaum argues that this sort of relativism leads to self-contradictions, and Donald Davidson, in an influential and typically difficult paper, attacks this form of relativism by denying that the idea of a conceptual scheme is a coherent one.  This is followed by a paper by Chris Swoyer in which he attacks the concept of truth-for a particular group or individual, a concept relativists of this sort may need.  Finally, there is a paper by Gerald Doppelt in which he draws on Kuhn's philosophy of science in order to defend a relativism of this sort.<br />The second half of the anthology focuses on the more narrow topic of relativism about morality.  What is moral relativism?  Here's a first pass.  The basic idea of relativism is that the moral facts are somehow constituted by the moral attitudes, beliefs, conventions, standards, etc. of a group of people, and that the truth and falsity of particular moral claims depends upon the moral attitudes, beliefs, conventions, standards, etc. of a group of people.   But, as David Lyons points out in his paper, there are two ways to understand this dependence, because there are two different groups that might matter here:  the group of the person making a moral judgment and the group of the person whose action is being judged.  I'll explain the distinction by focusing on what the two types of relativism tell us about the truth of a particular person's, b's, moral judgment that another person, a, ought not to commit murder.  One way of understanding this dependence gives us agent relativism, a view according to which b's judgment that a person a ought not to commit murder is true if and only if people in a's group have a negative moral attitude towards committing murder, or believe that committing murder is wrong, or have a convention against committing murder, or have moral standards that rule out committing murder, or something similar.  So, according to agent relativism, what matters is the group of the person being judged, the group of the person doing the action.  The other way of understanding the dependence gives us appraiser relativism, a view according to which b's judgment that a person a ought not to commit murder is true if and only if people in b's group have a negative moral attitude towards committing murder, or believe that committing murder is wrong, or have a convention against committing murder, or have moral standards that rule out committing murder, or something similar.  So, according to appraiser relativism, what matters is the group of the person doing the judging.  <br />Now that we know what moral relativism is, I can tell you about the selections on moral relativism here.  the.  There are papers defending forms of relativism by Gilbert Harman, Philippa Foot, and Bernard Williams.  Harman argues that a certain sort of agent relativism is the appropriate moral theory on the basis of certain views about when it is appropriate to claim that a person ought to do something.  Foot argues that a sort of appraiser relativism can be defended for some moral judgments, but not for all of them.  Bernard Williams is represented by two selections, one arguing that a crude form of relativism is incoherent and the other arguing that there may be something to a more sophisticated sort of relativism grounded in radically moral differences between groups.  This is followed by papers critiquing moral relativism by David Lyons and by Geoffrey Harrison.  Lyons formulates the distinction between agent and appraiser relativism, and he arguesthat appraiser relativism leads to endorsing contradictions.  Harrison argues against the ordinary view that relativism supports tolerance of other people.	2004-05-17

It's essentially a summary of a career of thought concerning the central issues in philosophy, and it is built around Nagel's big idea:  that the distinction between subjectivity and objectivity can help us to understand the nature and source of the central problems of philosophy.  It's an interesting and fruitful idea--though perhaps not as interesting and fruitful as he thinks--and it leads Nagel to lots of interesting ideas about how to understand, appreciate, and maybe even solve the central problems of philosophy.  <br />The main subject of the book is the relation between subjective and objective views of our minds, our selves, our thought, our actions, our moral views, etc.  The subjective view is our limited point of view:  it's the point of view we have when immersed in our own perspective on the world.  We reach more objective points of view by subtracting the parochial elements from our perspective.  In attempting to arrive at a more objective point of view, we step back from ourselves and place ourselves, along with our subjective points of view, in a broader conception of the world.  This involves trying to see the world as it would appear to a being with a \\"view from nowhere.\\"<br />But problems arise when we realize that it's difficult to integrate subjective and objective perspectives.  There is a tension between subjectivity and objectivity, and this tension appears in all areas of philosophy.  As a matter of fact, it's the source of most of the fundamental problems that plague philosophers.  When we take up a more objective viewpoint, the central elements of our subjective viewpoints are inexplicable.  When we arrive a more objective conception of the world by, say, doing more science, we find it hard to understand how we can have minds, how our ways of forming beliefs allow us to know the objective world, how we can make sense of objective reasons for action, etc.  But these apparently inexplicable things are among the crucial components of our subjective conception of the world and ourselves.  And we encounter a similar problem in the other direction.  When we are immersed in our subjective viewpoints, we find it hard to place ourselves and our viewpoint within an objective account of the world.  That is, we find it hard to see how our ways of knowing could be backed up in a way that makes them more than simply our ways of knowing, and we find it hard to see how our ways of acting could be backed up in a way that makes them more than simply our ways of acting.  <br />Nagel treats most of the traditional \\"solutions\\" to the problems of philosophy as based on two general tactics for dealing with the tension between objectivity and subjectivity.  According to Nagel, neither tactic is fully satisfactory.  The first tactic is to understand everything as objective, and the construe the subjective as mere appearance.  In contemporary thought, this tactic is manifest in overreaching forms of naturalism and scientism.  Nagel agrees that the sciences do provide us with an objective conception of the world, and with an objective conception of the world that is likely to be largely accurate.  But he doesn't think this means the sciences do or can provide us with an account of all the facts about the world, for they leave out our own subjective point of view.  This leaves us with a residual unease:  overarching naturalism provides us with an account of how things are that seems to leave something important out.  We do have conscious experiences, there is a way things seem to us, we do seem to act freely, we do seem to be under moral obligations, etc.<br />The second tactic is to search for an answer by going to the opposite extreme:  that is, by collapsing everything into the subjective point of view.  This is to claim that there is no way to draw back from our perspective in order to arrive at an objective perspective on the world and on our place within it.  And this view can result in even more extreme views according to which there is no objective world out there to discover, and according to which we can't even make sense of the very idea that there could be such a world.  In other words, to accept such a view is to acquiesce in some sort of skepticism, relativism, subjectivism, etc.  Again, though, such a solution leaves us with a residual sense of unease:  there is more to our ways of thinking and acting than that, isn't there?  There is the further question of whether we're really right about what we think, and whether we're really right to do what we do.  <br />Is there any way to avoid these problems?  Yes, we need a view of the world that is complex enough to accommodate both perspectives on the world; we need a view of the world that doesn't deny the reality of either the subjective or the objective.  But this isn't really an answer; it's just a statement of what any answer is going to need to look like.  Nagel doesn't claim to be able to offer a detailed solution to these problems.  The final conclusion is that the success of attempts to solve the problems of philosophy straight will require our having something we don't have yet--namely an understanding of these two perspectives and their relations to one another.  Can we have it?  Here Nagel is cagey.  At some points he offers some speculative suggestions about how this might go, at others he seems to doubt that it can be done.       <br />Notwithstanding the lack of answers here, Nagel thinks that understanding the problems of philosophy as he does provides us with some important insights.  It allows us to explain the nature and source of philosophical problems, and it allows us to understand these problems as closely related to one another.  It also helps to explain why the usual \\"solutions\\" to them don't convince.  Moreover, it allows us to see these problems as real problems, and as problems lacking obvious solutions.  This also supports our intuitions concerning the hopelessness of attempts to dissolve the problems of philosophy or to construe them as mere pseudo-problems.	2004-05-17

This is an anthology of papers by contemporary analytic philosophers about moral relativism.  It's chalk full of papers in which analytic philosophers do what they do best:  clarify the nature of positions, lay out the arguments for and against various positions, relate various positions and arguments to one another, etc.  If you want to know just what relativism is, just why someone might defend it, and just why someone might criticize it, this is the place to go.  <br />And, clearly, this is a topic where the clarity and patience you find in this collection is sorely needed.  Relativism is something about which there is a lot of discussion in academia, in the media, and in everyday conversation.  But rarely, if ever, do people discuss what they think relativism really is.  This is where this anthology can be very helpful, for many of these papers go to great pains to spell out just what relativism is and why it may or may not be a defensible position.  The way to get at relativism is to look at various common-sense ideas that are connected to relativism:  that the same thing can be right for people in one group and wrong for people in another, that morality is relative to a person's group, that there is no single true morality, that morality isn't objective, etc.  And it is also important to focus, as many of these papers do, on the fact that moral relativism is not simply a matter of the sociological and anthropological facts about moral disagreement and differences.  These facts are often take to suggest relativism, but it is important to recognize that they do not immediately imply it.  Relativism is one possible response to these facts about disagreement and differences in moral codes between different groups of people.  What we need is a way to formulate something approaching a theory of the status and nature of morality from this response to diversity in moral views and these common-sense ideas about relativism says and implies about morality.<br />Here's afirst pass.  The basic ideas of relativism are that the moral facts are somehow constituted by the moral attitudes, beliefs, conventions, standards, etc. of a group of people, and that the truth and falsity of particular moral claims depends upon the moral attitudes, beliefs, conventions, standards, etc. of a group of people.   But, as David Lyons points out in his paper, there are two ways to understand this dependence, because there are two different groups that might matter here:  the group of the person making a moral judgment and the group of the person whose action is being judged.  I'll explain the distinction by focusing on what the two types of relativism tell us about the truth of a particular person's, b's, moral judgment that another person, a, ought not to commit murder.  One way of understanding this dependence gives us agent relativism, a view according to which b's judgment that a person a ought not to commit murder is true if and only if people in a's group have a negative moral attitude towards committing murder, or believe that committing murder is wrong, or have a convention against committing murder, or have moral standards that rule out committing murder, or something similar.  So, according to agent relativism, what matters is the group of the person being judged, the group of the person doing the action.  The other way of understanding the dependence gives us appraiser relativism, a view according to which b's judgment that a person a ought not to commit murder is true if and only if people in b's group have a negative moral attitude towards committing murder, or believe that committing murder is wrong, or have a convention against committing murder, or have moral standards that rule out committing murder, or something similar.  So, according to appraiser relativism, what matters is the group of the person doing the judging.  <br />Now that we know what moral relativism is, I can tell you about the selections here.  The anthology opens with asection intended to introduce the issues that includes papers from Richard Brandt and James Rachels in which they try to formulate just what relativism is, why people are tempted to think it is true, and what issues its plausibility turns on.  <br />This is followed by a section on the nature and importance of cultural relativity as an argument for relativism.  William Sumner and Ruth Benedict defend (fairly crude) forms of relativism by appealing to the facts of cultural diversity.  Then there are three responses to this sort of argument:  W. D. Ross and Carl Wellman argue that cultural diversity does not obviously imply moral relativism in the way Sumner and Benedict appear to think, while Michele Moody-Adams argues that, regardless of the connection between the truth of relativism and the existence of moral diversity, the evidence for moral diversity of the relevant sort is far from convincing.  <br />The next section is on whether relativism is even a coherent position.  The best paper here is the one by David Lyons in which he carefully sets out the different sorts of relativism and argues that appraiser relativism leads to contradictions and so it incoherent.  Also included is a subtle and evenhanded paper by T. M. Scanlon.  The section following this is probably the one with the most philosophical meat.  It includes papers by Gilbert Harman and Philippa Foot in which they attempt to formulate defensible forms of relativism.  Harman argues that a certain sort of agent relativism is the appropriate moral theory for naturalists, and Foot argues that a sort of appraiser relativism can be defended for some moral judgments, but not all.  These two defenses of relativism are followed by responses from various angles:  Martha Nussbaum draws on virtue ethics to dispute relativism, Gordon Graham rebuts arguments from tolerance and pluralism for relativism, and Thomas Nagel argues that a sort of moral rationalism is to be preferred to relativism.<br />The final significant section concerns relativism and its connection to realism and rationality.  Much of this work isn't clearly connected to moral relativism, though it's all interesting.  Finally, there is a case study by Loretta Kopelman about the plausibility of moral relativism once we consider the nature of the real world practice of female genital mutilation.	2004-05-17

This is a textbook in the philosophy of language.  It is intended as a introduction to the Davidsonian program in the philosophy of language, and it introduces that program by explaining its outlines and applying it a variety of components of ordinary language:  sentences involving quantification, quoted speech, names, adjectives, sentences about actions and other events, and (in the second edition) natural kind terms.  <br />I'm not expert on this material, so I have little to say about these parts of the book.  I do, however, want to talk about Chapter X, where Platt's applies this program as providing a defense for a form of moral realism (i.e. the view that there are mind-independent moral facts).  This is a brief, cogent, and influential defense a sort of non-naturalist intuitionism.  And, unlike some defenders of views like these (e.g. McDowell and Wiggins), the arguments here are pretty straightforward and the outlines of the resulting position are clear.  Indeed, I think this chapter is the best place to start studying views of this sort.  <br />Here's an outline of the elements of Platts's position in this chapter.  The first element is cognitivism.  That is, he claims that moral claims are truth-apt, and that they purport to describe mind-independent moral facts.  <br />The second element is autonomy.  Platts argues that morality is both semantically and epistemologically autonomous in a very strong sense.  Moral language is autonomous of other language in that it cannot be analyzed in terms of non-moral language.  Platts also argues that morality is epistemologically autonomous in that we do not reach moral conclusions by drawing inferences from the non-moral facts.  We do not first discover what the non-moral facts are, and then apply some general principles about the relation between moral and non-moral facts in order to infer what the moral facts are like.  Instead, we intuit the moral facts.  Importantly, though, intuition does not require us to possess some special moral fact-detecting power that allows us to be influenced by special moral facts.  How, then, does intuition work?  Grasping the relevant concepts allows us to simply see, to look and observe, the moral properties of things.  Nevertheless, unlike other intuitionists, Platts does not hold that what we intuit is self-evident or certain; for he thinks we have to acknowledge the pervasiveness of fallibility in all areas of inquiry.  <br />The third element is a sort of pluralism that is a response to the reality of moral dilemmas and genuine moral conflicts.  Platts thinks there can be genuine moral dilemmas--cases in which people are unable to fulfill all there real obligations, cases in which a person does both good and evil.  There can be such dilemmas and conflicts since the moral facts do not consist in particulars actions, people, etc. having certain overarching goodness or badness; rather, they consist in these things possessing sundry more specific moral properties.  And a single thing may possess many different specific moral properties, some good and some bad.  And this conception of moral properties leads Platts to accept a particularist moral epistemology.  Moral intuitions are intuitions about particular actions in particular cases, and they are arrived at by looking and seeing all the multifarious details in that particular case rather than by coming to particular cases with a set of general moral rules.<br />After outlining his position in the first part of his chapter, Platts considers two important objections to his view.  The first problem his view faces is the challenge of dealing with the sociological and anthropological facts of moral disagreements and differences.  Why, if morality is a matter of objective matters of fact, do we find deep, persistent, and apparently unsettleable disagreements and differences of sort we actually find?  <br />Platts construes this challenge as the challenge posed by forms of relativism about morality, though I think he's actually concerned with something more general.  The data here pose a problem for the realist only if there is no standpoint outside the different moral conceptions of people from which we can decide who is right and who is wrong.  What is especially worrying for a realist of Platts's stripe is the possibility that others have moral concepts we lack (and do not understand), and that this allows them to see facts that we cannot see.  Such people would be able to intuit facts of we which simply aren't aware and perhaps can't be aware.  The relativist declares that the best response to these facts is to understand moral facts as conventional; they are set by the conventions of the relevant groups.  A nihilist might come to these same facts and say that they show there are no moral facts.<br />Platts's response to this worry is complicated, and I can only sketch it here.  First, he thinks the relativist needs to do more than show that there are such differences and disagreements; she needs to show that the realist cannot account for them.  But he thinks relativists rarely meet this requirement.  For a realist like Platts, one who thinks all our beliefs are fallible, has no problem with accepting moral errors in some cases.  We recognize that people commit such errors in other objective areas of inquiry, like the sciences.  What about cases in which we find radical differences in moral concepts possessed by different groups?  First, sometimes it turns out that this is really just a matter of groups having different accounts of a common concept.  One group thinks a property is possessed by one set of things, and the other group thinks it's possessed by another.  Second, in some cases, there do appear to be different conceptual schemes.  Yet we find the same thing in the sciences--some groups lack scientific concepts we possess--and the relativist needs to distinguish the differences here from moral differences.<br />The second type of challenge concerns the connection between moral judgments and reasons for action and the connection between moral judgments and motivation.  These are traditional considerations that have led people to accept some sort of nihilism or noncognitivism, for they suggest that there is something more than a belief to moral judgments.  I'm afraid I don't have the space to discuss either the problems or Platts's responses to them here.  But they're worth your time, I assure you.	2004-05-17

It is well organized and very clearly written.  Provided you come to this book with some knowledge of the topic, you shouldn't encounter problems in understanding Shafer-Landau's arguments or his basic positions.   And the book is structured in a way that one can see how the various debates in contemporary meta-ethics are related.  It allows the reader to see why these issues matter and why particular issues are being debated.  This, moreover, is an honest book in that Shafer-Landau acknowledges the weaknesses in his arguments and the difficulties his position faces.    <br />Another strength of this book is its comprehensiveness.  While this is a work of original scholarship and not an introduction to contemporary meta-ethics, Shafer-Landau covers enough ground for this book to function as an advanced introduction to most of the subject matter.  He discusses all the major areas in contemporary meta-ethics, and he does so by drawing on a vast knowledge of the relevant literature.  Furthermore, he does an excellent job of encapsulating the major debates and most influential arguments in contemporary meta-ethics.  Consequently, the book can serve as an entry to much of the contemporary literature in meta-ethics. <br />I'll now briefly describe the view Shafer-Landau is defending.  As I said above, he defends non-naturalist moral realism.  Moral realism is the thesis there are objective moral facts.  In other words, it is the thesis that there are moral facts, and they are not constituted by what any actual or possible person (or any actual or possible group of persons) thinks, feels, believes, etc.  Shafer-Landau argues that these objective moral facts are non-natural facts.  The moral facts are sui generis, and in particular they are not a sort of natural facts.  His non-naturalism also includes a thesis about moral language:  that it cannot be analyzed into the language of the natural or social sciences.  <br />In explaining his position, Shafer-Landau emphasizes that it does not commit him to the existence of strange, inexplicable moral stuff.  His position is that the moral facts are wholly constituted by non-moral (probably wholly natural) facts, though they are not identical to any non-moral facts.  This rests on a form of property pluralism according to which moral properties, though not identical to non-moral properties, are realized by non-moral properties.  Things have moral properties that are not identical to natural properties, and therefore moral facts (i.e. facts about which things have which moral properties) are wholly constituted by natural facts but are not themselves natural facts.  <br />I can't summarize the rest of Shafer-Landau's position or his arguments for it here, so I'll simply explain the structure of his book and provide a bare summary of his main conclusions.  <br />The book is divided into five parts.  The first part is a defense of the two major components of moral realism:  that there are moral facts, and that these facts are objective.  He first argues against noncognitivism, which he takes to be a form of nihilism (i.e. the view that there are no moral facts).  He then argues against constructivism, according to which there are moral facts but they are not objective.  Constructivists maintain that moral facts are constituted by what real or idealized people or groups of people think, feel, believe, etc.  He argues that both noncognitivism (i.e. nihilism) and constructivism fail to capture certain important aspects of morality, and that realists are better able to capture these features.  When we fully understand ordinary moral practice and thought, realism is the default position.  Given these facts, we ought to prefer realism--unless it faces insuperable problems.<br />In the remainder of the book, Shafer-Landau attempts to show that realists face no such problems.  He discusses what he considers to be the major problems facing realists, and he wants to show that none of them pose an especially grave threat to their views.  The responses to these problems also provide Shafer-Landau with room to elaborate and explain his own views.  <br />The first problem is metaphysical.  What are moral facts like, and how can we make sense of there being such facts?  He considers the sort of non-naturalism I described above to be a good response to these questions.  <br />The second problem concerns motivation.  How can realists explain the connection between moral judgment and motivation?  Many argue for the view that there is an internal (i.e. conceptual) connection between moral judgment and motivation.  If this is the case, then moral judgments must express conative states rather than beliefs; and so realism is false.  Shafer-Landau argues that for motivational externalism; that is, he argues that there is no such connection to be explained.<br />The third problem concerns connection between reasons and moral judgments.  How can realists explain the connection between moral judgments and reasons for action?  Shafer-Landau argues for a sort of rationalism:  that moral facts necessarily provide reasons for action.  This, he thinks, accounts for the normativity of moral facts.  However, he rejects reasons internalism, according to which a person's reasons depend on her commitments, desires, aims, projects, etc.  He thinks people can have reasons for action even if those reasons do not depend on these things.<br />Another problem is the existence and persistence of moral disagreement.  Why, if there are objective moral facts, do people disagree about moral issues in the way they do?  Here Shafer-Landau exploits some traditional responses to this argument, but his favored argument points to similar disagreements in philosophy and religion, and to the fact that we still take these areas to be objective.  Why, then, should we think this is not the case in ethics?<br />Finally, there are problems of moral epistemology.  How can a realist explain the possibility of acquiring moral knowledge?  He argues that some moral truths are self-evident, and that we can defend a reliabilist moral epistemology for other moral truths.<br />So far as I know, this is the most detailed and comprehensive contemporary treatise defending a form of non-naturalism.  For that reason alone, I'd recommend it to anyone interested in serious study of contemporary meta-ethics.  But, as I said above, I think this book can serve as a useful advanced introduction to the subject matter, and so I'd also recommend it to anyone with some philosophical background who is interested in these issues.	2004-05-16
US	23395896	R5IMSFZ75VYVW	0195105370	148942426	Morality and the Good Life	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Broad Coverage of Twentieth-Century Ethical Theory	This is an interesting anthology, and a useful one.  Many of the papers (or book excerpts) included here have been extremely influential; nearly all them are interesting and stimulating; and they're all worthy of serious study.  So this is an anthology that is worth having--though I'm not sure it's worth the full retail price.  <br />The book is divided into six sections, each on a distinct topic.  The first topic is the nature of moral goodness (and, in particular, of the language we use to talk about moral goodness), and it includes both cognitivist and noncognitivist accounts.  Indeed, the section centers around the debate between cognitivists and noncognitivists.  And the selections included are all from heavy hitters:  Moore, Firth, Ross, and Foot defend cognitivism (Foot and Ross by criticizing the forms of noncognitivism on display here), while Ayer, Hare, and Gibbard defend noncognitivism.  The second topic is theories about what constitutes a good human life, and it includes readings on the three major views here--hedonism, desire-satisfaction theories, and objectivism.  The topic of the third section is virtue ethics, and it includes classic work by Anscombe, Foot, and MacIntyre.  The fourth is moral realism vs. moral anti-realism.  This section begins with J. L. Mackie's classic defense of an error-theoretic account of morality, and it includes a non-naturalist realist response from John McDowell and a noncognitivist response from Simon Blackburn.  It ends with Nicholas Sturgeon's defense of a naturalist form of realism in his &quot;Moral Explanations,&quot; though, for whatever reason, the editors didn't include the work of Gilbert Harman's to which Sturgeon is explicitly responding in this paper.  (Still, Sturgeon probably explains Harman's points well enough for this paper to be understandable even if one hasn't already read Harman.)  The fifth topic is normative ethics, and this section includes readings on various types of consequentialism (e.g. Moore's ideal utilitarianism and Smart's act utilitarianism), on Ross's deontological theory, and a selection from Robert Adams on the divine command theory.  Finally, there is a section on the meaning of life.    <br />But, honestly, I cannot understand what the unifying theme of this anthology is.  It seems there isn't one.  As this summary should reveal, the emphasis here isn't on contemporary discussions.  For the readings come from much of the twentieth-century literature.  Nor is the emphasis on meta-ethics as opposed to normative ethics, as this includes sections on virtue ethics.  The authors describe it as a general anthology introducing ethical thinking in twentieth-century Anglo-American philosophy, and that seems to be as good a description as any I can think of.<br />I suppose the only real problem with having such a broad subject matter if that the coverage of particular issues is not as comprehensive as it could be.  There are thirty-four readings here, and they are intended to cover most of the major issues in contemporary meta-ethics and normative ethics as well as providing some examples of important early twentieth-century discussions of the same issues.  I guess I really don't see how thirty-four readings can cover that much material and cover it well.  Still, this isn't a problem for the whole of the anthology.  The sections on the nature of goodness and on theories of what constitutes a good human life are pretty comprehensive, but the sections on virtue ethics, on moral realism vs. anti-realism, and on wider issues in normative ethics aren't.  (The book also includes a section on the meaning of life.  I really can't say much about the extent of its coverage, since I know next-to-nothing about this topic.)<br />That said, this is a good anthology.  All of the selections are well-chosen, and many of them are contemporary classics.  And many of these papers aren't ones that are easily found in other anthologies.  The selections from Hare, Foot, and Gibbard on noncognitivism; from Firth on the ideal observer theory; from Frankena on obligation and motivation; from Adams on the divine command theory; and Anscombe's &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy.&quot;  These are all crucial works, and they're rarely anthologized.  Furthermore, if you're looking for an anthology to give you a taste of the range of thought in twentieth-century moral philosophy, this is a good place to go.  For you'll find something in this anthology about pretty much every topic that has been discussed at length.     <br />I'd recommend this anthology for anyone interested in contemporary meta-ethics, though, as I said, it isn't as comprehensive with respect to particular issues as some other anthologies.  The authors intend it to be useful as an introduction to these areas.  It might be useful as such an introduction--but only to those with significant philosophical sophistication or those who are going to be reading these selections in conjunction with either attending a series of lectures on these issues or reading a good introductory text on these issues.  Many of the papers are pretty advanced, and it's not clear to me how helpful they would be to people coming to these issues for the first time.	2004-05-16
US	23395896	R11OC7NXXBHDFU	0674000781	673421525	A Theory of Justice	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Just Read It	Surely, A Theory of Justice is among the most important and influential texts in contemporary philosophy.  And it is, of course, the central text in contemporary political philosophy.  Want just a few reasons to think this is an important text that you ought to read?  Here you go:  Rawls develops and defends a new theory of justice, he provides a new way to extend some of the basic ideas in the social contract tradition, his text was crucial in resurrecting Kantian moral theory, his work has helped to bring constructivist meta-ethical positions back into prominence, the book develops some new and influential criticisms of utilitarianism, and it includes an explication of the method of reflective equilibrium and demonstrates how it can be applied in moral theory, etc.  <br />This is a long, intricate, and densely argued book, and there's no hope of summarizing even its main claims  in this review.  Consequently, I'll simply aim to give a very sketchy account of the structure of his main argument here.  <br />Rawls's theory is a theory of justice as it applies to the basic institutions of a single society.   He calls his theory &quot;justice as fairness.&quot;  It is not that he thinks justice is simply fairness, or that a just society is a fair one.  Rather, people choose principles of justice in a position that is supposed to be fair; their choices in this fair position determine the correct principles of justice.  The principles of justice determine the nature of a just society; they apply to the basic structure of society--to its fundamental institutions.  They will be understood by people who accept them as principles telling them how their society should be structured with respect to how it provides people with their basic rights and liberties, how it determines people's opportunities in life, and how it structures the institutions in which people acquire wealth and income.  <br />The fair position for choosing these principles is what Rawls calls &quot;the original position.&quot;  His argument has the following structure:  he describes the original position, and then he argues that parties in the original position would choose a particular set of principles of justice.   The principles chosen constitute the correct theory of justice.  <br />The first part of the argument is a detailed account of the original position.  Parties in the original position are placed behind a veil of ignorance, where they are stripped of certain types of knowledge.  In particular, they lose all the knowledge of the contingent facts concerning their own standing in life and the details of life in their society.  Furthermore, they lose knowledge of their particular talents, desires, psychological traits, skills, etc.  Why prefer this as a position in which principles of justice are to be chosen?  The main idea is that it allows us to see the people as coming to fair terms for social cooperation, for this is supposed to be a fair situation for selecting the principles.  Parties behind the veil are unable to rig the principles of justice to benefit themselves rather than others; they aren't allowed to use their position or talents to strongarm people into selecting principles that aren't to those people's benefit; and they aren't allowed to craft the principles to suit their actual needs, aims, desires, etc.  However, parties in the original position do possess the sort of general knowledge about human psychology, human societies, and the natural world that would be required to choose between principles of justice.  <br />Now, importantly, placing individuals in the original position depends on a particular moral view; this is supposed to reflect our considered judgments about justice and fairness.  It is a way of drawing out what we actually think about these things.  This is not a historical argument:  the original position isn't supposed to be a description of some situation people were once in.  Nor is this an argument grounded in some account of human nature and psychology:  the parties in the original position aren't supposed to reflect something of importance about human psychology.  (One should see section 40 for an account of this as a Kantian conception of justice, though.  Here Rawls may be resting his theory on an account of us as beings of a certain sort.  But, again, this is a philosophical and moral account of persons; this isn't the sort of thing you're going to find out about by doing ordinary sociology, anthropology, or psychology.)<br />In the next part of his argument Rawls claims that parties in the original position would agree upon the following principles of justice.  The first principle is that individuals are to possess greatest amount of basic rights and liberties compatible with similar rights and liberties for others.  The relevant rights and liberties are the right to vote and to hold public office, freedom of thought, freedom of speech and assembly, the right to own property and to avoid unreasonable search and seizure, etc.  The second principle is that there is to be fair equality of opportunity with respect to positions of authority and responsibility, and that inequalities in wealth and income are be for the benefit of all, and particularly for the benefit of the worst-off group.  The first principle is to be satisfied before the second one, so rights and liberties cannot be sacrificed in the interest of securing more wealth or income for any or all people.  And one should notice that these principles do not clearly imply anything about how the institutions in which people acquire wealth and income are to be ordered or regulated.  This will depend on which set of institutions would actually meet the requirements set by the second principles, and this will depend on empirical facts about how the world works.  Moreover, it should be pointed out that many ways of ordering and regulating these institutions will be ruled out by the first principle, irrespective of how well offthey would make the worst-off group.     <BR>  <BR>This, clearly, should be read by anyone interested in contemporary analytic philosophy, and it is an absolutely crucial text for people studying ethics or political philosophy.	2004-05-16

McGinn tries to come at introducing philosophy in a different way:  through his autobiography and through the issues that prompted his interests in philosophy, the ideas he found interesting as a young man studying philosophy, and what he has thought about at particular times in his career as an academic.  <br />The results are rather mixed.  You don't get much of substance here, and so you should look somewhere else if you're searching for a serious and comprehensive introduction to philosophy.  But this book does cover enough ground to give you a taste of what current academic philosophizing is like.  It includes a breezy, straightforward picture of the life of an academic along with brief sketches of lots of interesting philosophical issues.  Furthermore, there's not a lot of history covered here; the emphasis is on a few historically important philosophical issues and the more striking arguments and positions that have been defended in contemporary analytic philosophy.  So this really gives you an account of what professional life is like for people working in contemporary Anglo-American analytic philosophy, the tradition in which McGinn works.   <br />It appears McGinn intends the reader to come to philosophy in the same way he did.  We go from the vague, somewhat confused ideas and concerns that first led McGinn to philosophy to immersion in ideas and concerns of current-day professional philosophers.  Now, this emphasis on the intellectual development might seem too limited a perspective from which to introduce a subject.  But this isn't such a problem here since specialization isn't as extreme in philosophy as it is in other parts of the academy.  Since the division of intellectual labor here isn't as extreme as it is in the sciences, all philosophers tend to know a lot of the same stuff.  <br />The book is quite interesting at the beginning, and I think the first couple of chapters would be a good introduction to just what philosophical thinking is like.  Here there are very few details about McGinn's early life, and he concentrates on only those elements of his autobiography that are relevant to his intellectual development and his eventual interest in philosophical questions.  So these chapters are concerned with the kinds of philosophical problems that are likely to be of interest to those without much, or any, background in the subject.  Skepticism, free will, the existence of God--these are the sorts of issues that are introduced in this chapter.  McGinn doesn't say a great deal about these issues here, though he says enough to reveal how philosophers attempt to answer them and how they criticize or defend the answers given by others.<br />The latter chapters come to focus more on the nature of life in academia and the issues that get discussed in contemporary analytic philosophy along with McGinn's own intellectual development as an academic.  So we really get two stories here.  The first story is the one of McGinn's rise to prominence in academia, and the other is the story of major issues in U.S. and U.K. philosophy from the sixties to the present.  And these stories are interconnected since McGinn is a prolific thinker who has published on nearly everything of central importance in contemporary metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language.  Some of the highlights he mentions are Davidson and Quine on meaning, Wittgenstein and Kripke on rule-following, Kripke and Putnam on reference, David Lewis on possible worlds, Dummett's anti-realism, Nagel's views about the mind and its relation to the body.  And whenever McGinn discusses someone's ideas, he attempts to provide a brief portrait of them.  <br />Whatever one thinks about McGinn's personality--and some aspects of it can be off-putting--his discussions of issues here is pretty even-handed.  While he occasionally says unflattering things about other philosophers, but he's more even-handed when it comes to their ideas--even those ideas with which he isn't sympathetic.  He doesn't ridicule the ideas of others; nor does he use the book to push his own ideas on the topics he discusses.	2004-05-06

Books	5	73	78	N	N	The Foundational Work in Modern Philosophy	Descartes's Meditations on First Philosophy is one of the few works of philosophy that absolutely every educated person needs to read at least once.  This is required reading for anyone interested in philosophy or its history, and honestly I don't see how this work can be ignored by anyone interested in the history of ideas.  It's also a work that I'd recommend to anyone who wants to be introduced to philosophy by reading the work of a great philosopher.  And don't worry:  it shouldn't take you more than an afternoon to read through it. <br />The Meditations has had an incalculable influence on the history of subsequent philosophical thinking.  Indeed, according to nearly every history of philosophy you're likely to come across, this work is where modern philosophy begins.  It's not that any of Descartes's arguments are startlingly original--many of them have historical precedents--but that Descartes's work was compelling enough to initiate two research programs in philosophy, namely British empiricism and continental rationalism, and to place certain issues (e.g. the mind-body problem, the plausibility of and responses to skepticism, the ontological argument for the existence of God, etc.) on the philosophical agenda for a long time to come.  Moreover, Descartes was capable of posing questions of great intrinsic interest in prose accessible to everyone.  So the Meditations is a work of value to both newcomers to philosophy and to those with a great deal of philosophical background.   <br />The First Meditation is Descartes's implementation of his method of doubt.  Descartes's aim here is to systematically doubt everything he believes that seems dubitable in any way and thereby to arrive at something that is absolutely certain and indubitable.  Here Descartes formulates two very famous skeptical arguments:   the dreaming argument and the evil demon argument.  The dreaming arguments calls into question my current beliefs about the world by drawing attention to the possibility that I might be dreaming now.  Can I know right now that I'm not dreaming?  If not, doesn't it seem that I don't know much of anything?  The evil demon argument is even more radical in that it focuses my attention on the possibility that almost my entire conception of reality is based on a very general delusion.  What if my every experience and all my reasoning results from constant deception by some being with God-like powers?  What, if anything, would I know if this were the case?  These worries, Descartes thinks, allow him to doubt nearly all his beliefs, and it indeed they may preclude his having any certain knowledge at all.  <br />The rest of the Meditations is Descartes's attempt to find something he can know for certain.  Famously, he begins by claiming that he can be certain of his own existence.  Even if he's dreaming or being deceived by an all-powerful evil demon, he can be sure that he exists.  For he couldn't dream or be deceived unless he existed.  <br />But even if he can be certain of his own existence, how can Descartes move beyond this to knowledge of a world outside his own mind?  By appealing to the existence of God.  He provides two distinct proofs for the existence of God:  one a variant of the ontological argument, which attempts to prove God's existence from an appeal to the very concept of God, and one a type of cosmological argument, which attempts to prove God's existence by appealing to something whose only possible cause is God.  Both these arguments, Descartes claims, prove that the world includes an absolutely perfect God.  And it is the perfection of God that Descartes to be confident that he can know things beyond his own mind.  For God, as a wholly perfect being, wouldn't provide Descartes with intellectual faculties that allow him to go wrong.  Consequently, Descartes can be sure that his beliefs are generally correct, provided that he has used his intellectual faculties in the way God intended. <br />This work also includes a statement of the sort of mind-body dualism with which Descartes is widely associated.  Although his arguments for dualism are obscure here, it is fairly easy to explain the central idea.  According to Descartes, mind and body are wholly distinct kinds of substance that interact with one another.  Mental states aren't a part of the natural world revealed by the sciences, and so, for instance, they are not reducible to certain things going on in a brain.  Instead, they're a wholly different type of thing--though a type of thing that is somehow causally connected to a brain.  <br />All of this is material, and a lot more, is covered in roughly sixty pages of text, and it is presented in some of the clearest, most straightforward philosophical prose ever written.  Plus, the reader needn't have mastered any arcane jargon or previous work in philosophy to understand Descartes's views.  And because it is written as a series of meditations in which Descartes leads us through something like his own process of through about these issues, it makes for relatively easy reading.    <br />This edition also includes Descartes's Discourse on Method, which, though it isn't as important or philosophically sophisticated as the Meditations, is an essential text for understanding Descartes's conception of his own project.  The book begins with interesting intellectual biography involving an account of his disillusionment with the intellectual culture of his time and of how this disillusionment led him to the project of finding a philosophical basis for a systematic scientific conception of the world.  This is followed by a short presentation of an early version of the main lines of Descartes's philosophical argument that he would go on to develop in the Meditations.  Then Descartes shows how he applied his method to discover a priori &quot;solutions&quot; to certain scientific problems.  The Discourse, then, provides one with a better sense of Descartes's self-conception as a philosopher and the role he thought his philosophical system should play in the thinking of his times<br />This is a serviceable edition of the Meditations and the Discourse for students, and I'm sure it's perfect for the average reader.  The translation is readable, and it doesn't seem significantly different from other translations of Descartes that I've read.  While there aren't a lot of frills here, there's a very brief account of Descartes's life and a short bibliography.	2004-04-30

It's not just that the translation of the Meditations often seems somewhat misleading in the details that are likely to concern serious readers of this work, but that Lafleur's decision to translate various editions of the Meditations and to run them together wasn't a very wise one.  Not only does it make the book somewhat harder to read than it should be, but it's questionable whether this provides one with an accurate picture of Descartes's thought.  This is an especially important concern since one of the three editions of Descartes's Meditations on which Lafleur relies is a French translation of the Meditations that Descartes approved for publication.  To the best of my knowledge, it's not know just how closely Descartes read this text before giving it his approval.  So relying on it in providing a translation of the work seems pretty dubious to me.  (To his credit, Lafleur makes clear where he's providing material from each translation and he relies on Descartes's original Latin edition as the basic text.  Material from the other editions is added in brackets.)  Also, the book has a very out-of-date bibliography, one that doesn't appear to have been updated since the translation was first published in the 50s.<br />That said, there is great philosophy on display here.  Descartes's Meditations on First Philosophy is one of the few works of philosophy that absolutely every educated person needs to read at least once.  This is required reading for anyone interested in philosophy or its history, and honestly I don't see how this work can be ignored by anyone interested in the history of ideas.  It's also a work that I'd recommend to anyone who wants to be introduced to philosophy by reading the work of a great philosopher.  And don't worry:  it shouldn't take you more than an afternoon to read through it.  But you can, of course, spend the remainder of your life thinking about the ideas contained in this work.<br />The Meditations has had an incalculable influence on the history of subsequent philosophical thinking.  Indeed, according to nearly every history of philosophy you're likely to come across, this work is where modern philosophy begins.  It's not that any of Descartes's arguments are startlingly original--many of them have historical precedents--but that Descartes's work was compelling enough to initiate two research programs in philosophy, namely British empiricism and continental rationalism, and to place certain issues (e.g. the mind-body problem, the plausibility of and responses to skepticism, the ontological argument for the existence of God, etc.) on the philosophical agenda for a long time to come.<br />All of this is material, and a lot more, is covered in roughly sixty pages of text, and it is presented in some of the clearest, most straightforward philosophical prose ever written.

It's not that any of Descartes's arguments are startlingly original--many of them have historical precedents--but that Descartes's work was compelling enough to initiate two research programs in philosophy, namely British empiricism and continental rationalism, and to place certain issues (e.g. the mind-body problem, the plausibility of and responses to skepticism, the ontological argument for the existence of God, etc.) on the philosophical agenda for a long time to come.  Moreover, Descartes was capable of posing questions of great intrinsic interest in prose accessible to everyone.  So the Meditations is a work of value to both newcomers to philosophy and to those with a great deal of philosophical background.<br />The First Meditation is Descartes's implementation of his method of doubt.  Descartes's aim here is to systematically doubt everything he believes that seems dubitable in any way and thereby to arrive at something that is absolutely certain and indubitable.  Here Descartes formulates two very famous skeptical arguments:  the dreaming argument and the evil demon argument.  The dreaming arguments calls into question my current beliefs about the world by drawing attention to the possibility that I might be dreaming now.  Can I know right now that I'm not dreaming?  If not, doesn't it seem that I don't know much of anything?  The evil demon argument is even more radical in that it focuses my attention on the possibility that almost my entire conception of reality is based on a very general delusion.  What if my every experience and all my reasoning results from constant deception by some being with God-like powers?  What, if anything, would I know if this were the case?  These worries, Descartes thinks, allow him to doubt nearly all his beliefs, and it indeed they may preclude his having any certain knowledge at all.<br />The rest of the Meditations is Descartes's attempt to find something he can know for certain.  Famously, he begins by claiming that he can be certain of his own existence.  Even if he's dreaming or being deceived by an all-powerful evil demon, he can be sure that he exists.  For he couldn't dream or be deceived unless he existed.<br />But even if he can be certain of his own existence, how can Descartes move beyond this to knowledge of a world outside his own mind?  By appealing to the existence of God.  He provides two distinct proofs for the existence of God:  one a variant of the ontological argument, which attempts to prove God's existence from an appeal to the very concept of God, and one a type of cosmological argument, which attempts to prove God's existence by appealing to something whose only possible cause is God.  Both these arguments, Descartes claims, prove that the world includes an absolutely perfect God.  And it is the perfection of God that Descartes to be confident that he can know things beyond his own mind.  For God, as a wholly perfect being, wouldn't provide Descartes with intellectual faculties that allow him to go wrong.  Consequently, Descartes can be sure that his beliefs are generally correct, provided that he has used his intellectual faculties in the way God intended.<br />This work also includes a statement of the sort of mind-body dualism with which Descartes is widely associated.

US	23395896	R3PQGLDMJQVC5K	0199241392	742877041	Ruling Passions: A Theory of Practical Reasoning	Books	4	33	35	N	N	Blackburn's Approach to Metaethics Summarized	Blackburn is one of the main figures in contemporary metaethics, and this is his big book on the issues.  He tries to lay out the general details of his approach to ethics here, so it's a book that's essential reading for anyone interesting in metaethics.  And it's a book that's slowly grown on me as I've studied it.<br />That said, it's evasive and frustrating at places, and it's longer than it needs to be.  Blackburn spends too much time on extraneous stuff, and provides too little detail about the absolutely crucial material in the first, third, and ninth chapters.  These are the chapters in which Blackburn lays out the fundamentals of his favored form of noncognitivism, explains the nature of the quasi-realist project, and attempts to answer the objection that his views lead to subjectivism or relativism.  Furthermore, there's just not enough engagement with the literature in large parts of this book--the obvious exception being chapter 4, which may be the book's best chapter.  (For those who'd like a better introduction to Blackburn's views in ethics, I'd recommend chapters 5 and 6 in his earlier Spreading the Word; and the essays on metaethics in Essays in Quasi-Realism are probably provide a better account for the expert.)<br />Here's a recap of what goes on in the main chapters here.  Not much of signal importance happens in chapter 1, but Blackburn very briefly explains why he thinks ethics is essentially practical and tries to say a bit about the sort of emotional and attitudinal states that are relevant to ethics.  Chapter 3, which is the heart of the book, gives us the basics of Blackburn's expressivism, introduces quasi-realism, and takes up some challenges to it (e.g. unasserted contexts, motivational externalism, moral truth and moral facts, etc.).  Chapter 4 is Blackburn's attack on all forms of cognitivism and moral realism; he argues against reductivist realisms, Cornell realism, and McDowell's and Wiggins's views.  Chapters 7 and 8 are concerned with the respective places of reason and sentiment in ethics; Blackburn's on the side of sentiment.  Chapter 9 is his attempt to answer challenges to expressivism alleging that it leads to subjectivism or relativism.  And there is a very helpful appendix that clarifies what Blackburn takes his quasi-realist project to be and why he thinks expressivism is preferable to other metaethical views.<br />The remaining chapters are interesting, but inessential.  The discussion of issues in normative ethics in chapter 2 is underdeveloped and largely unnecessary.  Blackburn comes out in favor of consequentialism on the grounds that virtue theories and deontological theories need to appeal to consequentialist considerations in order to make sense of virtues and duties.  The material about egoism and game theory in chapters 5 and 6 is true and important--though none of it is terribly original and it's hard to see why it plays a crucial role here.<br />With all that out of the way, I'll try to put some philosophical meat on the bone by outlining what I take to be Blackburn's central metaethical views.  First, Blackburn's expressivism.  Blackburn's expressivism is a noncognitivist account of moral language; it claims that moral language is (primarily) used to express attitudes.  If theory is correct, our moral practice is guided by the aim of expressing our own attitudes about parts of the natural world and coordinating our attitudes with those of other people.  Consequently, we do not need to posit moral facts, nor do we need to posit any special faculty for arriving at moral knowledge.<br />The aim of Blackburn's project is pretty straightforward:  Blackburn's is a project of naturalizing ethics.  He wants to understand ethical thought and language as part of a naturalistic conception of human nature.  The most obvious way to naturalize ethics would be to attempt a reduction of the moral to the natural.  But this isn't the route that Blackburn takes.  Indeed, his expressivism isinconsistent with taking this approach to reconciling moralizing with his naturalism.  Blackburn thinks we ought to &quot;synthesize&quot; moral propositions in order to understand moralizing naturalistically.  And synthesizing the moral proposition is not a matter of reducing it to anything else; it is a matter of understanding its place within a broader naturalistic account of human beings and of moralizing as a human activity.<br />For Blackburn, then, the emphasis is on explanation rather than reduction.  In this explanation the expressivist starts with the activity of moralizing.  Why do we have an activity like this?  What naturalistic explanation do we have for the practice of moralizing and for the existence of moral language and thought?  Starting with answers to these questions amounts to synthesizing the moral proposition rather than analyzing it.  We don't begin with ordinary moral claims and try to find some natural facts that make them true or false.  Rather, we begin with a naturalistic account of the world and our place within it, and we try to explain why we think morally and why we use moral language in the way we do.<br />Now, it's not that those who aren't expressivists cannot offer any explanation of moralizing.  The problem for cognitivists is that there's a central and essential element of morality they simply cannot explain.  According to Blackburn, the cognitivist's explanation cannot account for the practical dimension of morality.  Moralizing is a practical activity:  that is, it's an activity that leads to and coordinates action in a group of people.  There's an essential tie between moralizing and acting, and the cognitivist's explanation appears to leave this out of the picture.  Why is it left out?  It's open to a person to simply not care about the moral facts.  Some people might care about these moral facts but that turns out to be a contingent fact about human psychology.<br />The fundamental virtue of expressivism, Blackburn thinks, is that it alone succeeds in explaining moralizing in a way that is consistent with naturalism, that it alone makes sense of why we moralize in a way that is consistent with the best account of the world and of human beings that is provided by the natural sciences.  Expressivism accounts for the essential practicality of moralizing.  For moralizing, if the expressivist is right, is primarily a matter of expressing one's attitudes, and attitudes possess a necessary connection to action.	2004-04-30

Perry's book manages to covers a lot of ground without getting bogged down in details, and the dialogue format makes it more engaging than your usual, textbook-format introduction to some philosophical question.  Moreover, its compression makes it an excellent book to teach.  Since the arguments are compressed and the bigger issues are usually just hinted at, there's a lot that can be said about the arguments presented in the book beyond what Perry comes right out and tells you.<br />What is the question of personal identity?  Basically, it's the question of what makes a person one and the same person through time.  I assume I'm very same person I was two days ago, two months ago, two years ago, two decades ago, etc.  Given that I've changed a great deal over that period of time, how could this be?  What is it about me that makes me the same as the guy who was sitting in class two days ago, the guy who was anticipating spring break two months ago, the guy who was entering grad school two years ago, the kid who was sitting in some kindergarten class two decades ago, etc.?  There's been a lot of physical and psychological change over time, and yet I think I'm the very same person I was at those various times.  How could that be?<br />Perry discusses three views here.  The first view is a sort of dualism according to which personal identity is a matter of the identity of souls across time.  If this view is correct, what makes me the same as those guys is that we share a common soul.  The second view is a sort of physical view according to which personal identity is a matter of identity of bodies across time.  If this view is correct, what makes me the same as those guys is that we share a common body.  The final view is a sort of psychological continuity view according to which personal identity is a matter of having appropriately related psychological states through time.  So what makes me part of the same person as those guys is that there is a normal process of psychological development from the kindergarten kid through the first-year grad student through the guy sitting in class two days ago and up to me right now.  <br />And all of these views have problems that the interlocutors discuss.  Some problems for the soul identity theorist:  What is this soul, and how can we know about it?  How can you account for the fact that we think persons are closely connected to their physical bodies?  Some problems for the bodily identity theorist:  How can you account for the fact that we seem to be able to imagine cases in which the same person switches bodies?  How can you account for the apparent importance of issues of psychological continuity to our judgments about personal identity over time?  How can you account for the fact that we seem able to figure out who we are simply through introspection?  And some problems for the psychological continuity theorist:  What exactly is the relevant kind of psychological continuity, and can it be defined in a non-circular manner (i.e. in a manner that doesn't assume facts about personal identity through time)?  And if it reduces to a kind of similarity, couldn't I be psychologically continuous with lots of future (or past) people even though I can't be identical to lots of different future (or past) people?<br />Each of these objections is pressed against the respective views, and some attempt is made to defend them against these criticisms.  Since Perry's aim is to present the issues and the kinds of considerations that are relevant in thinking about personal identity, there is no attempt to reach a final conclusion on the issues.  <br />And Perry tries to bring out that this is a philosophical issue with an importance beyond philosophy.  He does so by focusing on the implications of these various theories for the possibility of human immortality and for existence after bodily death.  If the soul view is correct, it seems to secure the possibility of my existing after my bodily death.  But there are worries here.  First, there are worries about the independent plausibility of the soul view; and second, there are worries about whether the soul view can be spelled out in such a way that whatever survives my bodily death is something recognizable as me.  If the bodily identity view is correct, then it seems I exist only when my body does and thus survival of bodily death is impossible.  Consequently, the prospects for immortality depend on the prospects for the eternal existence of my body.  The issues are somewhat more complicated with the psychological continuity view.  It seems to be consistent with my surviving bodily death, as it seems there could be a being with psychological states continuous with mine but who doesn't have a body.  But things aren't as clear as they may seem unless we know something more about just what sort of psychological continuity we're talking about.  On some views, the relevant sort of continuity requires something like the causal relations between psychological states that occur within the human brain.  And if that's what kind of psychological continuity would be required for me to exist beyond my death, it's not at all clear that this allows for the possibility of survival after bodily death.    <br />I recommend this book for everyone interested in the question, and especially to those who are new to the subject.  Perry both introduces the basics of the subject, and he presents variants on some classic and contemporary arguments in the literature.  So the book also serves as an introduction to the literature on the subject.  It would, of course, be helpful to supplement this book with Perry's collection on personal identity, which includes the classic work  (by Locke, Butler, Reid, and Hume) on the subject and some of the most important recent work (by Shoemaker, Williams, Parfit, Nagel, et al).	2004-04-29

It begins with an informative introduction by Perry.  The introduction presents the basic problem and the way philosophers traditionally have thought about it.  Then Perry gives a summary of most important points made in the historical material included in the anthology.   <br />What is the question of personal identity?  Basically, it's the question of what makes a person one and the same person through time.  I assume I'm very same person I was two days ago, two months ago, two years ago, two decades ago, etc.  Given that I've changed a great deal over that period of time, how could this be?  It seems like I, the very person sitting here and typing this now, was once an undergraduate planning to go to grad school, once a high school student getting ready for college, once a elementary school kid, and once a newborn baby.  But it's clear that I don't look or think a lot like those previous people who appear to be one and the same as I am.  There's been a lot of physical and psychological change over time, and yet I think I'm the very same person I was at those various times.  How could that be?<br />And this is a philosophical issue that seems to have practical ramifications.  It appears to have consequences for how we understand ourselves and other people:  Does a person survive radical amnesia?  How about brain death?  Could a person survive after bodily death?  Could there be multiple people in the same body at the same time?  If a person's memories, beliefs, desires, etc. change so that there's little or no connection to her previous self, is she really the same person at all anymore?  Consequences for how we relate to people:  If my friend suffers from amnesia and never recovers his prior memories, is he really still my friend (is he still the same person I knew before)?  If my mother is dying from a disease that has left her little more than a body rotting away in a hospital bed, is she still really my mother (i.e. the same person who raised me)?  And moral consequences:  Is a fetus a person?  If a person's psychology has radically changed over time, is it still fair to hold her responsible for things she did long ago (maybe she's no longer the person who did whatever we want to hold her responsible for)?   <br />Now, clearly, it's pointless to try to summarize even the most important ideas that you'll find in the readings collected here.  There are too many positions, too many important arguments, and too many interesting issues to say much of importance about the anthology as a whole.  But I will try to give you some sense of the contents here.<br />The first reading is from the seminal work on this topic, namely Locke's discussion in his Essay concerning Human Understanding.  In a few justly famous thought experiments, Locke argues against the view that personal identity consists in identity of immaterial soul over time and the view that it consists in identity of body over time.  He then proposes a version of the view that personal identity consists in the stages of a person sharing memories of previous stages.   This is followed by more recent essays by Paul Grice and Anthony Quinton in which they defend views similar to Locke's.  These two essays are responses to problems raised in the next two essays, both of which include classic objections to Locke's memory theory of personal identity.  Joseph Butler argues that Locke's view begs the question since any accurate account of memories presupposes an account of personal identity.  Thomas Reid argues that Locke's view fails to respect the transitivity of identity in some cases.  And then there are two more readings querying the plausibility of the memory view, one by Sydney Shoemaker and one by Perry himself. <br />Then the anthology moves on from discussions of the memory view to other views about personal identity.  The first alternate view is Hume's.  In some famous material from his Treatise of Human Nature, he argues that there is no personal identity over time.  Two of the remaining three papers argue for similar conclusions.  Derek Parfit argues both that there may be no personal identity over time, and that identity isn't what matters through time.  It is perfectly rational, he thinks, to care about the future of beings with psychologies similar to ours even if we aren't identical to them; and this is supposed to have important practical consequences.  Thomas Nagel argues that our concept of a person main not apply in certain real-world cases of brain bisection, and he thinks that such cases may show that our concept of a person doesn't even apply to us in our normal condition.  The final paper in the collection is by Bernard Williams.  He argues that there seem to be cases in which bodily continuity is more important than psychological continuity.  <br />While the reader should look elsewhere for the state of the art on the issues, I'd recommend this anthology to anyone interested in personal identity.  Nearly all of these papers are classics that you ought to know if you're going to more recent work on this issue, and so it's still well worth buying even if you're more interested in contemporary thought about the topic.	2004-04-29

Books	4	96	97	N	N	A Brilliant Allegory of Something or Other	The basic story of Coover's book is quite simple.  Henry Waugh creates an intricate single-player baseball game that's played with dice.  He plays entire seasons with his eight-team league; he keeps detailed statistics for every player and every game; he creates backstories and personalities for his players; he develops an administrative body for his league and imagines political debates among the players; and he acts as an official historian of the league, writing volumes of stories about the game and its players.  When something shocking and unexpected occurs within the game, Henry gradually loses the ability to distinguish between reality and imagined events within the game.  In the end, he is more or less consumed by his game.  <br />As the synopsis above no doubt suggests, this story begs to be read as an allegory.  One might read it as an allegory of God's relation to His creation.  Henry, like God, is a creator who appears to have complete control over his creation, and yet, like God, his creation comes to take on a life of its own.  When terrible things occur, he desperately wants to step in and set things right, but he also wants the game to retain its integrity.  So Henry is like God in that he remains outside his creation even though it seems he could sometimes intervene to set things right.  (Indeed, some of the game's players are said to have some sense of a higher power controlling their destiny.)  One might also read Henry's relation to his game as an allegory of man's attempt to make sense of his world through art, religion, science, philosophy, etc.  All that's really going on is the random event of rolling the dice, as, in some sense, all that's really going on in the universe is certain random physical events.  And yet Henry imagines an entire alternate reality to make sense of the random events of his game.  His player backgrounds and psychologies, his historical interpretations of the game, his imaginings of crowds and stadiums--all of this is intended to give the random throws of the dice some meaning, some significance to him.  (This reading is also suggested by our one look at Henry at work in his job as an accountant.  Rather than merely crunch the numbers, he reads a story of the operation of a business off his accounting books.  He makes sense of the numbers by seeing them as evidence of something beyond themselves.)  Finally, one might interpret Henry's relation to his game as an allegory of the artist's relation to his works.<br />These allegorical readings notwithstanding, it's also possible to read this book as a simple and moving story of one isolated man who gradually loses touch with reality.  While Henry seems a decent enough chap, he has no family, only one friend (and not an especially close one), no real love interest, and no interests outside of his game.  From what we learn in the novel, it seems his entire life consists in (occasionally) going to work at his mind-numbing job, stopping at the local bar to drown his sorrows, and sitting at his kitchen table playing his game.  Since Henry's life is thoroughly dull and uneventful from the outside, the book focuses on what's going on in his mind.  The focus of the book is his isolation and his attempts to create something important and lasting and to be a part of something larger than himself.  The opportunity to create something important is what the game appears to provide him, and so it's not all that surprising that he ends up losing himself in his game.      <br />This, of course, suggests that Henry can be understood as an example of the way in which alienated individuals can get lost in solitary pursuits that are made available to them by modern life.  Because he lacks an community of people with which to identify, Henry ends up getting lost in his game in much the same way that others can get lost in books, television, the internet, etc.  All of these things appear to provide their user with a connection to a world beyond himself, and yet total immersion in them brings you no closer to other people than you'd be without them.  <br />I'd give this book 4.5 stars if I could; that seems a more accurate assessment.  The reader should note that this isn't really a baseball book.  It's more about the trappings of baseball--the statistics, the history, the players, the rites--than it is about the game itself.  So this isn't a book for someone looking for a presentation of dramatic athletic feats; instead, it's a book for the baseball fan whose appreciation of the game is intellectual rather than visceral.	2004-03-28

And by that I mean that it's a book that should be read by any serious student of philosophy and that should be interesting to anyone with some interest in the subject.  If you've ever heard murmurings about the pernicious doctrine of logical positivism and wondered just what it could be, this is the book for you.  But don't be misled:  this book isn't of only historical interest--though it is, of course, an important historical document.  While its central doctrines aren't currently in fashion and aren't in fashion for good reason, this book, like all historically important work in philosophy that's worth reading today, isn't of interest only to historians of the subject.  If you want to understand the contemporary scene in English-language philosophy, you're going to need to understand the positivism Ayer and likeminded philosophers espoused since many major currents in contemporary philosophy can be fully understood only as reactions to their views.<br />Ayer's project here is the project of all young philosophical radicals--solving all the problems of philosopher, or at least showing that there were no real problems that needed to be solved.  In less than two hundred pages of lucid prose Ayer gives you a brief statement of the central assumptions of the doctrine and a demonstration of how it can be applied to problems in nearly every area of philosophy.  Needless to say, in Ayer's hands it appears to work wonders wherever it's put to work.<br />Ayer's positivism, as he himself admitted, was really an updated version of Hume's radical empiricism.  But Ayer wasn't as a gifted a philosopher as Hume, and consequently, the strengths of this book aren't a matter of the truth of its conclusions (they're probably false), or the cogency of its arguments (they rarely convince), or the originality of its insights (they're really nothing new).  Instead, the greatness of this work resides in its ability to inspire.  This is a young man's book, and it's one written with the verve and self-assurance of a recent convert who's sure he's got all the answers and just needs to get them out there for the world to see.  Ayer doesn't pause to consider objections; he doesn't draw back from his more eye-opening conclusions; and he certainly isn't worried about offending his readers' more delicate sensibilities.<br />The central tenets of Ayer's positivism can be stated in but a few sentences.  (I'll ignore the niceties here and try to get the main ideas across.)  The central component of positivism is a test for meaningfulness.  A sentence, Ayer claims, is meaningful if it means either of two conditions:  (i) its truth (or falsity) is analytic, or (ii) it is possible to acquire some empirical evidence pertaining to its truth (or falsity).  If neither of these conditions is met, the sentence is literally nonsense (i.e. it doesn't say anything capable of being true or false).<br />The task of philosophy, then, is one of testing sentences of various types and seeing whether they're meaningful.  First, the philosopher asks whether the sentence is true (or false) in virtue of the meaning of its words.  If it is, it counts as meaningful and we're done.  Math and logic, Ayer claims, are exhausted by sentences of this sort.  If it isn't true (or false) in virtue of meaning, we proceed to the next step.  In the next step the philosopher seeks to determine whether there is any empirical evidence that does or could bear provide evidence of the truth (or falsity) of the sentence.  If we could imagine some method of acquiring observational evidence pertaining to the proposition, then it's meaningful and the philosopher sits back and waits for the sciences to determine whether or not it's true.  If it turns out that there simply isn't any empirical evidence that could be gathered for or against the sentence, it's literally meaningless.  Meaningless how?  Well, sentences of this sort don't really say anything about the world; they doesn't make a claim that is true or false.  People may find them important in some way, they may stimulate people's emotions and lead them to act in certain ways, but they're literally nonsensical.  They say nothing about how the world is, and they have no place in a respectable philosophical or scientific view of the nature of the world.  According to Ayer, this sort of nonsense is found in ethics, in religion, and in most of the weighty tomes of the great philosophers.<br />The task of Language, Truth and Logic is to defend these conclusions and the conception of philosophy that has led Ayer to them.  So it's clear that the influence of Hume on Ayer's positivism extended beyond matters of philosophical doctrine; the influence was also a methodological and attitudinal one.  For Ayer, like Hume, goes where his argument takes him and is happy to demolish whatever stands in his way, including common sense, religion, and a few thousands years worth of philosophy.<br />And, of course, this sort of willful iconoclasm also makes the book a lot of fun to read.thered for or against the sentence, it's literally meaningless.

Slowly but surely, they came to see the philosophy of science as something more than applied formal logic.  But as someone who doesn't work in philosophy of science, I find this book fascinating for other reasons.  The most important reason is that this book, like much good philosophy of science, works for me as a sort of applied epistemology since Kuhn takes up abstract philosophical arguments and applies them to particular episodes in the history of science.<br />Of course, as most everyone knows, Kuhn's account of the history of the sciences revolves around the notion of a scientific paradigm.  A paradigm, in the most important sense, is a set of standards, practices, and theories shared by a group of scientists.  So a paradigm includes all the following things:  the central theories of the relevant science, important experimental results and techniques, guidelines concerning which problems are and are not important, standards of evidence against which theories are to be judged, etc.  Through the reading of textbooks, studying with proponents of the paradigm, and doing labwork of certain sorts, individual scientists come to accept the elements of the paradigm.<br />When there is a regnant paradigm in a particular science, what Kuhn calls 'normal science' occurs.  Normal science primarily involves puzzle-solving, which is a matter of attempting to solve the problems the current paradigm tells us are important and solving them in ways consistent with the methods and theories of that paradigm.  Normal science is not a wholly stable enterprise, though, for it is always the case that anomalies, problems the paradigm seems unable to solve, develop as the paradigm is applied to new phenomena.  Isolated anomalies are usually ignored, on the assumption that further development of the paradigm will lead to their solution.  But not all are solved even in the long run, and eventually there are enough of them that working scientists begin to take notice.  This is when the science enters a crisis period, when the once-obvious truth of regnant paradigm begins to seem less obvious to many scientists.  Now scientists begin to propose new paradigms, and some win converts.  When one of the new paradigms proves able to solve many of the glaring anomalies that plagued the previous one, most scientists will switch over to the new paradigm and those who do not will eventually die off.  Following this revolutionary paradigm switch, there is another period of normal science as working scientists begin applying the new paradigm.  This process, according to Kuhn, is probably an endless one.<br />And it is the details of Kuhn's account of paradigm change that appears to result in certain problems for the objectivity of science.  In particular, the nature of scientific revolutions seems to preclude a gradual progress of the sciences towards the truth about the world; or, at least, it does not allow us to guarantee that such progress will occur.  Why?  Because it seems paradigm change cannot be based on an objective consideration of the evidence for and against particular paradigms.<br />The central worry about the objectivity of science arises from what Kuhn calls the 'incommensurability' of different paradigms.  There are at least two distinct worries here.  First, there is what we might call 'standard incommensurability'.  When the accepted paradigms change, the accepted standards of a good scientific theory change--different experiments are conducted, different evidence is taken to be conclusive, and old problems are ignored.  So accepting up a new paradigm means you're bound to see that paradigm as better justified than its competitors; indeed, it means you're bound to have real trouble seeing what competitors take to be evidence for their preferred paradigms.<br />But, one might wonder, isn't the objectivity of science assured through reliance on observations that can be shared by different scientists and on experiments that can be repeated?  Not so, Kuhn argues, because the theory-ladenness of observation undermines the possibility of such a theory-neutral set of empirical data.  We don't test theories against raw observations; we test them against observations that are interpreted in light of the theories we hold.  What theory you hold partially determines what you see, and so it partially determines what you take to be observational evidence.  So proponents of different paradigms will see different things in the same experiments and observations, and thus there isn't any theory-neutral body of empirical evidence to which we can appeal in determining which of the competing paradigms should be adopted.<br />There is a second form of incommensurability, viz. meaning incommensurability, and it leads to similar problems.  Kuhn accepts a holistic semantics of scientific terms according to which the terms used by scientists acquire their meaning from the network of theory in which they are used.  The meaning of a scientific terms--like, say, 'gravity'--is determined by the paradigm in which it is being used.  Consequently, when paradigms change, so do the meanings of the terms employed by scientists.  So, for instance, the word 'gravity' has a different meaning in Newtonian physics than it has in current relativity theory.  This has a significant result for the nature of debate between proponents of different paradigms:  namely, that proponents of different paradigms are talking past one another.  There is a misleading appearance of agreement and disagreement here, but proponents of different theories really can't argue with one another about the same phenomena since their words have different meanings.<br />The consequences of these different forms of incommensurability can seem pretty radical.  First, standard incommensurability seems to show that paradigm change cannot be based on a consideration of evidence; and second, meaning incommensurability seems to show that a proponent of one paradigm cannot even understand the theories involved in another paradigm.  The process of paradigm change, then, comes to seem necessarily non-rational.  Scientists come to hold the paradigms they do for psychological or sociological reasons, and not because of a careful consideration of the evidence for and against the various available paradigms.  And if this is the case, it's not at all clear why we should think that the history of science involves a trend towards a discovery of the truth about the nature of the world around us.ience assured through reliance on observations that can be shared by different scientists and on experiments that can be repeated?

US	23395896	REQNILPRXCYR0	0521282462	628222499	Representing and Intervening: Introductory Topics in the Philosophy of Natural Science	Books	5	35	37	N	N	An Introduction That's Not Just for Neophytes	This book, which is among my all-time favorite philosophy books, is a paradigm of how the subject should be introduced.  It succeeds in introducing readers to many of the most important issues and ideas in contemporary philosophy of science; it's informed by a thorough knowledge of the history of both science and philosophy; it advances a unique perspective, one emphasizing the importance of experimentation as opposed to theorizing, on debates about scientific realism; and it is written in a straightforward and engaging style.  In other words, this is an excellent book--one that manages to be both entertaining and informative.<br />As I mentioned above, Hacking's emphasis here is on experimentation as opposed to theorizing.  Naturally, philosophers of science are drawn to the study of scientific theorizing; theorizing is what they do, and it's what they understand.  But Hacking argues that the prospects for scientific realism (i.e. for the view that the sciences are objective and reveal the (approximate) truth about the world) are dim if you focus on theory alone, and he thinks this is something that has been borne out by recent philosophy of science.  Rather than focus on theorizing, he claims, we should focus on the ways in which science involves intervention in the world.  Through experimentation, scientists can step into the world and manipulate and change it.  This is the way that science allows us to discover something about the world around us--not by the relatively passive activity of formulating theories, but by action in the world.<br />Hacking starts his book by giving a brief overview of how the historicism of Kuhn altered the project in the philosophy of science.  He argues that earlier philosophies of science, like Carnap's positivism and Popper's falsificationism, had agreed on quite a bit despite their superficial similarities.  Kuhn's work came along and upset all of this consensus.  He denied that there was any particular method shared by all the sciences across time, that the sciences involved a cumulative process of knowledge acquisition, that observation could be distinguished from theorizing and understood as an independent source of evidence for and against theories, that the sciences could be understood ahistorically, etc.  These views also posed some problems for the objectivity of science.  The assumptions Kuhn denied were those undergirding the traditional conception of the objectivity of science, of how scientific inquiry arrived at truths about the world.<br />But does this mean that an understanding of the history of science should undermine our confidence in the objectivity of science and the accuracy of its results?  In some ways, Hacking's book is an introduction to these worries and the various possible responses to them.  For most philosophers, issues concerning the objectivity of science turn on the question of whether we have good reason to believe that our best scientific theories are true (or approximately true) or that we are making gradual progress towards true theories by doing science.<br />In the first half of the book, Hacking discusses important arguments for and against the view that we have good reason to believe that our best scientific theories are true.  Here he is primarily concerned with what he calls realism about theories:  the doctrine that scientific theories are true or false, and that we have good reason to believe that many of our best theories are true (or approximately true).  Hacking covers a lot of interesting ground in his discussion of the prospects for this sort of realism.  He begins by discussing positivist and pragmatist accounts of the nature of science and the reality that science can reveal to us.  He then takes up arguments about incommensurability that have been developed by Feyerabend and Kuhn, and that appear to question our understanding of science as progressing towards the truth about the world.  This is followed up by a chapter about causal theories of reference and how they might allow us to avoid arguments from meaning incommensurability.  Hacking then takes a bit of detour and considers how Putnam was led from his causal theory of reference to a form of anti-realism; this chapter, while perhaps not central to the argument, is an interesting introduction to Putnam's views around the time of the publication of Reason, Truth, and History.  He then discusses Lakatos's methodology of scientific research programmes.<br />All of this first half of the book is very exciting, and it's somewhat different from the usual introduction to the philosophy of science.  It's not that Hacking is discussing material different from what you find in introductory texts of this sort; he isn't.  But he is more interested in drawing lessons from the history of philosophy and in appealing to views outside the narrow confines of the philosophy of science.  For instance, the chapter on Putnam's internal realism (and its similarities to Kant's epistemological views) would be out of place in most introductory philosophy of science tests, but it's a perfect fit here.  This makes this book more interesting to philosophers in general, and it also reflects that fact that individual areas of philosophy aren't wholly separate from one another.  While the philosophy of science does have a distinctive subject matter, it is bound to be influenced by developments and trends in other areas of philosophy.<br />Anyway, Hacking has serious doubts about the plausibility of realism about theories.  This doesn't mean he doubts the objectivity of science, however.  He thinks we should shift our emphasis, when discussing issues of objectivity, from theorizing to experimentation.  So he defends realism about entities:  the doctrine that scientific experiments involve the observation and manipulation of  real entities, and that we have good reason to believe experimentation involves this sort of interaction with the real world.  But, he thinks, this doesn't establish that the theories we have about these entities are correct in all their details.  The second half of the book is an extended defense of Hacking's realism about entities.<br />The ideal audience for this book is philosophically sophisticated readers who don't know a great deal about the philosophy of science, though I think much of the book would be useful to anyone interested in the philosophy of science.	2004-03-07
US	23395896	R1XGPI6NYQH4E0	0198250320	569497549	Sorting Out Ethics	Books	4	18	18	N	N	Sorting Out Hare	This book has the appearance of an introduction to issues in contemporary meta-ethics, and I assumed it was something of this sort when I picked it up.  I was wrong.  It's not that this book couldn't be read as an introduction to meta-ethics; it could be so read.  Still, introducing meta-ethics clearly isn't what this book does best.  Rather, it works best as an introduction to Hare's own meta-ethical views.  I don't doubt that Hare himself considered this something of an introduction to meta-ethics more generally, but that's because he held what are now fairly nonstandard views about the nature, methods, and aims of meta-ethics.  So this work is a better introduction to Hare's meta-ethics than it is to meta-ethics in general.<br />That said, I can't think of any book that better introduces Hare's own meta-ethical views.  I've previously read the sections on meta-ethics in both The Language of Morals and Freedom and Reason, and I think Hare's arguments here are clearer, more compelling, and much more interesting.  (I know I wish I'd read this before reading those other books, which honestly I found rather dull in places.)  And since his views were pretty much unchanged throughout his career, you don't have to worry about getting a different Hare in this book than you'd get by going to one of those other books.  <BR>   <BR>This books begins with two chapters that provide an introduction to Hare's views about the nature and methods of ethical theory.  In short, he claims that meta-ethics is the study of the moral language, and he tries to explain why study of moral language is of some value for substantive moral inquiry.  <br />This is followed by a set of lectures that forms the heart of the book.  Hare begins these lectures by providing what he thinks is an exhaustive taxonomy of the main positions in meta-ethics, of the main possibilities for providing an account of the meaning of moral language.  He then states his aim in the series of lectures:  to argue that allthe possibilities other than his own universal prescriptivism fail.  In each chapter he takes up a possible position, describes its nature, and presents some reasons to think that it doesn't provide us with an accurate account of moral language.  In the end he hopes to show that his preferred view retains all the virtues of the other possible positions while avoiding their weaknesses.  <br />This section of the book is both a passable introduction to some parts of contemporary meta-ethics and a very good introduction to Hare's own views.  One strength of this as an introduction to Hare's views is that it allows one to see just why Hare thinks that other possible theories fail.  Another strength, and one not unconnected to the first, is that it makes clear what Hare thinks any adequate theory of moral language needs to look like.  As he dismisses possible theories because of certain apparent shortcomings, it becomes clear just what problems Hare thinks a successful theory would need to avoid and what elements of our common-sense moral discourse and thought such a theory would need to preserve.  Finally, this makes especially <BR>clear just how Hare thinks his own views should be distinguished from the views of others.     <br />In the final chapter, which consists of the essay &quot;Could Kant Have Been a Utilitarian?&quot;, Hare takes up some issues in normative ethics.  In some ways, this serves as an introduction to Hare's own position in normative ethics, a position that he thinks is both utilitarian and Kantian.<br />I think I've listed some pretty significant virtues of this book, though I should also mention that Hare writes pretty good philosophical prose.  And that, I think, is always a plus.  Nevertheless, there are a couple, relatively minor, problems with this book.  The first is that it doesn't really cohere as much as it could; it's clear that its distinct sections weren't written with the intention that they be included in a single book.  For instance, it seems that the last chapter is simply tacked on in order to provide some coverage of Hare's views in normative ethics.  The second problem is that Hare can be rather smug at times.  He's so convinced of the truth of his own position and of the obvious merits of his arguments for it that he often finds it necessary to impute willful bias or sheer blindness to those who disagree with him.  Perhaps this is especially annoying to me because I rarely agree with Hare, but I must say that I find it distracting and unnecessary.  <br />Nevertheless, Hare is clearly an important figure in contemporary moral philosophy, and I suspect he will be for some time to come.  And since I can't think of a book that better introduces the most important elements of his own positions, I recommend this book to everyone interested in Hare or twentieth-century meta-ethics.	2004-03-05

While Kant himself considered this a sort of introduction to ethical thinking, it's come to be his most influential and widely read work on ethics.   Despite its length--it's less than a hundred pages--this is a work of remarkable depth and intellectual insight.  <br />This isn't an easy work, however.  It needs to be read and re-read (and, I suppose, re-read) to be fully understood and appreciated.  I've never found Kant as difficult and obscure as his reputation would suggest, but as a writer of philosophical prose he's certainly not the caliber of, say, Hume or Descartes.  As many have noted, Kant is the first great philosopher of the modern era to have been an academic, and it shows.  He writes long, meandering sentences, and the organization of his works leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Furthermore, his penchant for arcane terminology and architechtonic can make his work seem more forbidding than it is.  Still, Kant's ideas in the Groundwork, while subtle and sometimes elusive, are profound and original, and this book is a must-read for anyone interested in philosophical ethics.  I should also note that the importance of this book isn't solely historical since there has been a recent resurgence of Kantian moral thinking in the English-speaking world.<br />Kant's aim in the Groundwork is to discover the fundamental principle of morality.  In the first section he attempts to derive this fundamental principle from ordinary moral thought.  In particular, he attempts to derive this principle from considerations concerning what is unconditionally good.  Kant claims that the only thing that is unconditionally good is a good will.  Moreover, its goodness is not a matter of the results of acting on a good will; it is good in itself.  As a matter of fact, Kant claims that the results of an action done with a good will and the aims and inclinations of the agent with the good will are morally insignificant.<br />What, then, is it to act with a good will?  It is, Kant argues, a matter of doing one's duty for duty's sake, regardless of one's feeling and the results of doing so.  What is it to act from duty's sake?  It is to act from principles that accord with the fundamental principle of morality.  And here we get the first formulation of the fundamental principle of morality:  act only on maxims that you can consistently will to be universal laws.  In other words, if one is unable to will the principle of one's action to become a universal law, the action is morally impermissible.  <br />In the second section of the Groundwork Kant attempts to draw the same conclusion from some philosophical points about the nature of duty.  He begins by claiming that our knowledge of our duty is a priori and based on the exercise of reason.  He then argues that facts about our duties are necessary facts, and that this shows that they must be based on a categorical imperative:  that is, that our duties apply to us insofar as we are rational beings, irrespective of the contingent aspects of their nature.  And, Kant argues, the one categorical imperative is the fundamental principle of morality mentioned above.  He then applies this principle to some examples in order to display just how it grounds our duties in particular cases.  <br />The rest of the second section is filled with lots of interesting, albeit abstruse, ideas.  First, Kant attempts to ground the categorical imperative in something that is of unconditional worth.  What is that something?  The existence of rational beings, which, he says, is an end in itself.  And this leads to a second formulation of the categorical imperative:  (ii) act only in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in the person of yourself or someone else, as an end and never merely as a means.  <br />This section also includes a third formulation of the categorical imperative:  (iii) act only on maxims that you could will to become universal laws legislated by your own will.  This formulation encapsulates Kant's claim that we can achieve autonomy only by acting in accordance with the moral law.  Conformity with the moral law does not constrain our freedom since we legislate the moral law for ourselves.  The moral law is not forced on us from without; its source is to be found in our own rational nature.  Indeed, it is only by acting morally that we are able to achieve genuine freedom by transcending the contingent desires and inclinations that are beyond our control.<br />Of course, that doesn't come close to summing up the Groundwork.  But it's a start. <br />Gregor's translation of Kant's text is fairly clear.  She does her best to render Kant's work in readable English prose, and she usually succeeds in this endeavor.  I also think Kant's main ideas come through pretty well in this translation.  Moreover, this is likely to become something like the standard edition of Kant's Groundwork in the future, since this translation is the one that appears in the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant.	2004-03-02

Indeed, according to nearly every history of philosophy you're likely to come across, this work is where modern philosophy begins.  It's not that any of Descartes's arguments are startlingly original--many of them have historical precedents--but that Descartes's work was compelling enough to initiate two research programs in philosophy, namely British empiricism and continental rationalism, and to place certain issues (e.g. the mind-body problem, the plausibility of and responses to skepticism, the ontological argument for the existence of God, etc.) on the philosophical agenda for a long time to come.  Moreover, Descartes was capable of posing questions of great intrinsic interest in prose accessible to everyone.  So the Meditations is a work of value to both newcomers to philosophy and to those with a great deal of philosophical background.   <br />This is an excellent edition of the Meditations for students for a number of reasons.  First, it's the same translation of the Meditations (and of the relevant passages from the Objections and Replies) that appears in the Cottingham, Stoothoff, and Murdoch three-volume edition of the philosophical works of Descartes, which is quickly gaining wide acceptance as the best edition of Descartes's work in English.  Second, it includes a selection of important passages from the objections and replies to Descartes's Meditations.  So this volume allows you to see some of the most serious objections to Descartes's work that were made by his contemporaries along with his responses to those objections.  Finally, this edition includes some helpful introductory material.  It includes two different introductions:  one by Bernard Williams that focuses on Descartes's method and the most important lines of argument in the Meditations; the other by John Cottingham, the translator and editor of this edition, focusing on the place of the Meditations within Descartes's philosophical corpus.<br />That said, it's time to talk about the content of the Meditations.  The first, and most famous, of the Meditations is Descartes's implementation of his method of doubt.  Descartes's aim here is to systematically doubt everything he believes that seems dubitable in any way and thereby to arrive at something that is absolutely certain and indubitable.  Whatever he can discover to be certain in this way, he thinks, will provide him with a firm foundation for the remainder of his knowledge.  Here Descartes formulates two very famous skeptical arguments:   the dreaming argument and the evil demon argument.  The dreaming arguments calls into question my current beliefs about the world by drawing attention to the possibility that I might be dreaming now.  Can I know right now that I'm not dreaming?  If not, doesn't it seem that I don't know much of anything?  The evil demon argument is even more radical in that it focuses my attention on the possibility that almost my entire conception of reality is based on a very general delusion.  What if my every experience and all my reasoning results from constant deception by some being with God-like powers?  What, if anything, would I know if this were the case?  These worries, Descartes thinks, allow him to doubt nearly all his beliefs, and it indeed they may preclude his having any certain knowledge at all.  <br />If these are real possibilities, how can he know anything?  The rest of the Meditations is Descartes's attempt to answer this question.  Famously, he begins by claiming that he can be certain of his own existence.  Even if he is dreaming or being deceived by an all-powerful evil demon, he can be sure that he exists.  For he couldn't dream or be deceived unless he existed.  But even if he can be certain of his own existence, how can Descartes move beyond this to knowledge of a world outside his own mind?  <br />Descartes thinks he can get outside his own mind by appealing to the existence of God.  He provides two distinct proofs for the existence of God:  one a variant of the ontological argument, which attempts to prove God's existence from an appeal to the content of the concept of God, and one a type of cosmological argument, which attempts to prove God's existence by appealing to a phenomenon whose only possible cause is God.  Both these arguments, Descartes claims, prove that the world includes an absolutely perfect God.  And it is the perfection of God along with God's role as his role as a creator that allows Descartes to be confident that he can know things beyond his own mind.  For God, as a wholly perfect being, wouldn't provide Descartes with intellectual faculties that allow him to go wrong when he uses him as they were intended to be used.  Consequently, Descartes can be sure that his beliefs are generally correct, provided that he has used his intellectual faculties in the way God intended.  Thus, he can be sure that, in general, his views about the world around him are correct.  <br />This work also includes a statement of the sort of mind-body dualism with which Descartes is widely associated.  Although his arguments for dualism are obscure here, it is fairly easy to explain the central idea.  According to Descartes, mind and body are wholly distinct kinds of substance that interact with one another.  Mental states aren't a part of the natural world revealed by the sciences, and so, for instance, they are not reducible to certain things going on in a brain.  Instead, they're a wholly different type of thing--though a type of thing that is somehow causally connected to a brain.  <br />All of this is material, and a lot more, is covered in roughly sixty pages of text, and it is presented in some of the clearest, most straightforward philosophical prose ever written.  Plus, the reader needn't have mastered any arcane jargon or previous work in philosophy to understand Descartes's views.  And because it is written as a series of meditations in which Descartes leads us through something like his own process of through about these issues, it makes for relatively easy reading.    <br />This is required reading for anyone interested in philosophy or its history, and honestly I don't see how this work can be ignored by anyone interested in the history of ideas.  It's also a work that I'd recommend to anyone who wants to be introduced to philosophy by reading the work of a great philosopher.	2004-02-28
US	23395896	R34CUKFJIKDH9C	0198752482	183650094	An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (Oxford Philosophical Texts)	Books	5	83	91	N	N	As Exciting and Thought-Provoking as Philosophy Gets	Hume, I and many others think, was the greatest philosopher to have written in English, and this is the book to pick up if you want to introduce yourself to Saint David's distinctive brand of classical empiricism.  This is a must-read for anyone with even a passing interest in philosophy, and it's hard for me to see how anyone interested in the history of modern thought can avoid reading this book or the corresponding sections of Hume's Treatise.<br />As is well-known, the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding was intended as an encapsulation and popularization of the views Hume defended in Book I of his magnum opus, A Treatise of Human Nature.  Hume assumed that book's commercial failure could be accounted for by its length, difficulty, and lack of accessibility, and so, being a man who desired literary fame, he hoped to acquire commercial success by presenting the same ideas in a more appealing and accessible manner.  Unfortunately, it seems Hume misunderstood what the literati of his day were looking for in a philosophical treatise.  For the Enquiry, like the Treatise before it, didn't bring him the fame he sought.  Still, Hume did understand what goes into writing excellent philosophical prose, and consequently this book is a much easier read than Book I of the Treatise.  Indeed, this book constitutes an excellent introduction to Hume's thought, and, except for maybe Berkeley's Three Dialogues, I can't think of another primary source that would serve as a better introduction to classical British empiricism.<br />Now, let's get to the ideas here.  Hume, like the other classical empiricists, was primarily concerned with the psychological question of the origin of our concepts.  About the answer to this question, the empiricists were all agreed--our concepts are furnished by experience, which includes both sensory experience and introspection (i.e., the experience of our own mental states).  And the empiricists also agreed about the way we can justify our beliefs.  Some beliefs are true (or false) in virtue of the ideas they contained, and we can know their truth (or falsity) simply by thinking about them; other beliefs are true (or false) in virtue of how the external world is, and we can know their truth (or falsity) only by drawing on our experiences of the world.  According to Hume, all substantial conclusions about the world fall into this second category.  That is, the truth (or falsity) of all substantial claims about the existence and nature of things in the external world can be discovered only by checking those claims against the evidence of our senses.<br />The traditional way of placing Hume within the story of empiricism goes something like this.  Hume takes up the empiricism of Locke and Berkeley and pushes it to its logical conclusion.  Whereas Locke and Berkeley hadn't been wholly consistent empiricists, Hume, the true believer, demonstrates that classical empiricism leads to a pretty thoroughgoing skepticism.  Since he's wholly convinced of the truth of his empiricist premises, Hume is willing to accept the skepticism that goes along with them.  However, those who aren't convinced of that his empiricism is obviously correct think that Hume has actually demonstrated the implausibility of his empiricism.  If this is where empiricism leads, they think, then it's clear that we need to reject empiricism.  Indeed, some, like Thomas Reid, view Hume's arguments as constituting a reductio ad absurdum of his sort of empiricism.  On this interpretation, Hume's philosophy essentially presents a dilemma for all future thinkers:  abandon empiricism, or accept empiricism along with Humean skepticism.<br />But a different view of Hume, one of Hume as proposing a wholly naturalistic account of the human mind, has recently emerged as a competitor to the general conception of Hume's place within philosophy sketched in the previous paragraph.  This interpretation downplays Hume's skepticism and emphasizes his professed intentions to provide a positive account of the operation of the human mind that appealed to nothing beyond the evidence of our senses.  According to proponents of this interpretation, Hume is most interested in a description of the operation of the human mind.  He's describing what human nature allows us to know and what it doesn't allow us to know.  Furthermore, he argues that our nature is such that, where it fails to provide us with the resources to acquire the knowledge we might want, it provides us with a natural habit of forming the right conclusions anyway.  Even though our nature limits our knowledge of the world, it ensures that we possess the habits of mind needed to make our way in the world.  Hume dubs all these habits of mind &quot;custom.&quot;<br />If this view is correct, then Hume has abjured many of the normative aims of traditional epistemological inquiry.  He isn't attempting to show how we can answer a skeptic or why we have good reason to believe what we think we know.  Instead, he wants us to stand back from our everyday beliefs and think about the natural processes that result in them.  How, exactly, do our minds operate?  How do we come to think what we do about the world?  Hume thinks that this sort of inquiry will lead us see that, at some point, the explanation of why we think what we think reaches certain brute facts about the operation of the human mind.  When we reach these points, there is nothing more to be said.  We simply can't help thinking in these ways, and we lack the resources to demonstrate that these ways of thinking constitute an accurate way to represent the operation of the external world.  And, Hume claims, it turns out that many of the fundamental elements of our conception of the world--the belief that things stand in causal relations to one another, the belief that we can know that there is a world outside our minds, the belief the future will resemble the past--end up not being open to ratification by experience.  With respect to beliefs of these sorts, we ultimately have to appeal to custom in order to explain their existence and popularity.  Hume, then, can be seen as demolishing the pretensions of reason in order to make room for a wholly naturalistic account of human thinking.entions to provide a positive account of the operation of the human mind that appealed to nothing beyond the evidence of our senses.

Ross's The Right and the Good is clearly one of the preeminent works of twentieth-century ethical theory.  Indeed, I'm not sure that any other book I've read provides a more plausible account of the nature of everyday moral thinking.  (While I'm not sure that everyday moral thought is predicated upon the more recherche elements of Ross's meta-ethical views--namely his intuitionism and his non-naturalism--it seems to me that his pluralism and his deontological theory of rightness are supported by common-sense moral thinking.)<br />Here Ross gives the first fully developed statement of his intuitionism, which is significantly influenced by the views of G. E. Moore and H. A. Prichard.  Ross tends to set up his longer chapters as responses to the views of others, and often his sparring partner is Moore.  This makes Ross's work invaluable to anyone trying to work their way through Moore's Principia.  While Ross agrees with Moore on many of the central issues in ethics--with the very important exception of his repudiation of Moore's consequentialism--he's quick to take Moore to task when they disagree about details or about how best to formulate certain arguments.  Actually, it seems to me that this book is much better than Moore's more famous work.  Of central importance to philosophers are the facts that Ross's prose is clearer and less convoluted, and that his arguments are often more convincing.  It's also clear that he benefited from debate about Moore's work, as he's careful not to make the sorts of glaring errors that Moore often seems to make.  Moreover, Ross is somewhat less elusive about epistemological issues concerning ethics than Moore was.  While his intuitionism doesn't leave room for much to say about ethical epistemology, he says more than Moore did and what he does say is somewhat more plausible.<br /><br />The first two chapters of Ross's book are concerned with the term 'right'.  This part of Ross's book draws on and extends Prichard's work whilearguing against Moore's ideal utilitarianism.  The first chapter concerns the definition of the term 'right.'  Against Moore's view that right actions were, by definition, those that produced the greatest amount of intrinsic goodness in the universe, Ross argues that 'right' is indefinable.  However, unlike Prichard, Ross doesn't conclude from this that there is nothing much to be said about what makes right acts right.  And in the justly famous second chapter, Ross goes on to say something about the nature of rightness.  Here Ross introduces his notion of prima facie duties.  Being a prima facie duty is &quot;the characteristic ... which an act has, in virtue of being of a certain kind (e.g. the keeping of a promise), of being an act which would be a duty proper if it were not at the same time of another kind which is morally significant&quot; (p. 19).  So acts have prima facie rightness and wrongness in virtue of what types of acts they are, and not in virtue of their consequences or the intentions of the agent.  Furthermore, since every act will be of many different types--some of which are prima facie right, and some of which are prima facie wrong--every act will have both prima facie rightness and prima facie wrongness.  Acts are right simpliciter if their prima facie rightness is outweighed by their prima facie wrongness.  And the elements in virtue of which acts are prima facie right or wrong are irreducibly pluralistic; there is no single aspect of all acts that accounts that accounts for all the facts about their prima facie rightness and wrongness.  So, for instance, it is not the case that all acts are right insofar as they are acts contributing to the happiness of all sentient beings (and wrong insofar as they fail to do this), and thus hedonistic utilitarianism is false.<br />What we know by intuition (and what is self-evident) about rightness and wrongness, Ross claims, is that certain general principles about prima facie rightness and wrongness are true, and that individual acts, qua acts of a certain types (e.g. an act of promise-keeping), have prima facie rightness or wrongness.  But we don't know by intuition which particulars acts are right and wrong in specific cases.  Discovering this requires careful attention to all the competing ways in which a single act is both prima facie right and prima facie wrong, and it is not possible to find any general principles that will allow us to weigh these elements in all cases.<br />The rest of the Ross's book is concerned with goodness or intrinsic value.  Like 'right,' he thinks the term 'good' is indefinable.  And he argues that goodness, like rightness, is a non-natural property of things and a property things possess independently of human thought or attitudes concerning them.  Which things does Ross think possess such goodness?  He argues that certain states of mind (e.g. virtuous disposition, pleasure, and knowledge) are intrinsically good, and that this can be can be known by intuition.<br />In addition to its importance as a historical document and as a work filled with interesting arguments, this book is important because of the recent revival of intuitionist, non-naturalist, and pluralist views in contemporary meta-ethics.  Ross is perhaps the most significant influence on those taking part in this revival, and this book will help you to understand why.<br />This book is essential reading for anyone interested in ethical intuitionism or the history of twentieth-century ethical theory, and I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in ethical theory more generally.<br />Finally, for those purchasing this edition of The Right and the Good.  The text of The Right and the Good is unaltered in this edition, and the original pagination has been retained.  This edition also contains a substantial introduction by editor Philip Stratton-Lake.  This introduction is helpful, and it covers a lot of the the material on Ross that will be most interesting to contemporary readers.  Three main subjects are discussed in the introduction:  Ross's non-naturalist moral realism; his ethical intuitionism; and his deontological and pluralist critique of consequentialism.  Stratton-Lake's aim here is to present Ross's views and to show how they might be defended against some of the more common criticisms of them, criticisms Stratton-Lake thinks are often based on misunderstanding of Ross's views.	2004-02-27

It's also a central text in the history of philosophy, and it can be understood as the work that initiated contemporary ethical theory in the English-speaking world.  Of course, this isn't a work that came out of nowhere.  In fact, it's informed by Sidgwick's firm grounding in the history of previous ethical thought.  And unlike many great philosophers, what Sidgwick has to say about his intellectual forbears is usually reasonably accurate.  (See his Outlines of the History of Ethics for additional evidence of his knowledge--and for an excellent introduction to the history of ethics.)<br />This book is long; it's detailed; and it aspires to comprehensiveness.  Indeed, all of the main areas of philosophical ethics (viz. meta-ethics, normative ethics, and moral psychology) are covered herein.  Consequently, it's simply impossible to summarize Sidgwick's argument here.  Instead of futilely attempting to do so, I'll simply provide the barest outline of Sidgwick's aims and his results.  <br />According to Sidgwick, there are three fundamental methods of ethics:  egoistic hedonism, intuitionism, utilitarianism.  He wants to examine the nature and plausiblity of each of these methods.  The fundamental principle of egoistic hedonism is that what one ought to do (i.e. what one has most reason to do) is what will maximize one's own net amount of pleasure in the long run.  The method of hedonism is the method of determing what one ought to do by accumulating empirical evidence about the consequences of particular actions for one's own happiness.  Intuitionism, according to Sidgwick, is the view that we have an ability to discern the rightness and wrongness of actions without drawing on empirical evidence concerning the consequences of those actions.  The intuitionist tells us that certain fundamental moral principles are self-evident to all who understand them.  And intuitionism, Sidgwick claims, is themethod underlying common-sense morality.  Finally, the fundamental principle of utilitarianism is that what we ought to do is what will maximize the net amount of pleasure for all sentient beings.  <br />Perhaps the most important conclusion of Sidgwick's book is that the method of intuitionism is swallowed up by utilitarianism.  For utilitarianism allows us to explain all the elements of the morality of common sense, elements that Sidgwick discusses at length in his account of intuitionism; and furthermore, the self-evident moral principles at which a reflective intuitionism allows us to arrive are principles from which we can prove the fundamental principle of utilitarianism.  This, Sidgwick thinks, eliminates any apparent conflict between these two methods, and it shows that utilitarianism, when properly understood, is consistent with common-sense morality.<br />But Sidgwick thinks that the relation between utilitarianism and egoistic hedonism remains problematic.  The final conclusion of his book is that there is an apparently irreconcilable contradiction in our moral thinking.  It seems we have compelling, and perhaps overriding, reasons to do both what is our moral duty and what is in our own interest, but, Sidgwick claims, there is no compelling argument that moral duty and self-interest will always converge.  That is, there is no good reason to think that acting morally is always in our self-interest, and this is problematic since both our moral duties and our self-interest place genuine claims on us.  Practical thought, then, seems to end up in a fundamental sort of contradiction.  <br />This book is mandatory reading for anyone interested in ethics.	2004-02-27

(Indeed, judging by his statements in the Preface, Harman thinks the properly philosophical part of thought about morality is exhausted by meta-ethics.)  What is meta-ethics?  The study of the metaphysics, semantics, epistemology, and psychology of morality.  <br />This isn't a textbook on ethics; it's an original work of philosophy written in such a way that it is accessible to those without a substantial philosophical background.  Still, Harman does a pretty good job of introducing readers to many of the issues in meta-ethics while developing his own naturalistic account of morality, an account that ends up being a form of moral relativism.  Harman does discuss positions other than those he favors, but they are discussed only insofar as they have some role to play in the progress in his own argument.  And he does refer to historically important thinkers (e.g., Hume, Kant, Moore, and Hare), primarily using their work as a foil to his own or as a source of insights he can use in formulating his own theory.  <br />So this isn't a book for someone looking for comprehensive coverage of the positions in meta-ethics or an introduction to historical work on this subject.  (If you're looking for a textbook on meta-ethics, you might try Stephen Darwall's Philosophical Ethics or Alexander Miller's recent An Introduction to Contemporary Meta-Ethics.  Both of those works present and criticize most of the important positions in contemporary meta-ethics.)<br />The book begins with a seminal, albeit frustrating, argument that Harman thinks poses a problem for the objectivity of ethics.  Harman argues that a fundamental problem with putative moral facts, whose existence would be necessary for morality to be objective, is that it appears they cannot be tested against observation.  He then presents an account of the nature of observation according to which this problem boils down tothe fact that it appears moral facts cannot be fit into the explanatory framework provided by our scientific conception of the world.  In particular, it seems we cannot understand how moral facts could causally interact with anything in the world in such a way that could ultimately cause our having experiences of them.  Consequently, we cannot have observational evidence for or against claims about putative moral facts.  <br />The rest of the book can be understood as Harman's response to the worry presented in this chapter.  First, Harman considers whether this argument ought to lead us directly to moral nihilism, the doctrine that there are no moral facts.  He thinks not.  In chapters 2-4 he scrutinizes some possible responses to this worry, including reductive naturalism, emotivism, and the ideal observer theory.  This is followed by the long central section of the book in which he develops his own response to the worries about moral facts formulated in the first chapter.  Harman ends up arguing that there may be moral facts, and that, if there are, these facts can be fit into a naturalistic worldview.  However, he claims that these moral facts are relative ones.  That is, he argues for a form of moral relativism.  <br />He begins with analysis of what it means to claim that someone morally ought to do something, and here he argues for a form of reasons internalism.  More specifically, he argues that if it is true that person P ought to do action A, then P has reason to A.  He then argues for a relativistic theory of reasons.  According to Harman, a person has a reason to A only if there is some process of reasoning that would lead the person to do A (or at least to be motivated to do A).  How do we determine what reasoning might lead a person to do?  Harman suggests that we can find a clue to answering this question if we focus on the social nature of morality.  He presents a view according to which morality has developed through certain social conventions accepted within groups.  Moral reasons ultimately depend on these conventions; they apply only to those who have, at least implicitly, accepted the conventions of a group.   So a person's moral reasons are supplied by her commitment to the conventional rules of that group.  <br />Importantly, persons outside the relevant group, i.e. persons not committed to the relevant conventions, do not have such reasons.  And since Harman has argued that one ought not to act a certain way only if one has reasons not to do so, it is not true that those outside the relevant conventions ought not to act as they do.  Even if those people act in a way that violates the conventions of our group, we cannot truly say that they ought not to have acted that way.  This is perhaps most clear if we consider an example Harman himself uses.  Hitler, he tells us, was clearly outside our moral conventions, conventions that rule out slaughtering millions for our political goals.  So, while it is true that we who are committed to such conventions (and thus have reason not to act in this way) ought not to do such thing, Hitler had no such reasons and so it was not true that he ought not to have done what he did.  Given his psychology and his lack of commitment to any such conventions, there was no reason for him not to have ordered and overseen the Holocaust.  And since he ought not to do have done so only if he had such reasons, it's not the case that he ought not to have ordered the Holocaust.  We cannot apply our standards to Hitler, who is outside our group, and truly judge that he ought not to have done what he did.  Harman thinks that a sort of criticism of Hitler is possible, however--but it isn't possible to correctly claim that he ought not to have done what he did.  Harman claims this view is consistent with our normal usage of 'ought' and our intuitions about how it ought to be applied in such cases.  We think that we cannot apply our moral standards to a person like Hitler, that he is \\"beyond the pale.\\"      <br />So, on Harman's account of morality, there do end up being moral facts; they are psychological facts about the reasons people have to behave in certain ways.  Nevertheless, these facts are relative and not universal.	2004-02-23

Warburton's book is essentially a textbook on philosophy for the absolute beginner, and it's a very good one.  Indeed, I can't think of any introductory philosophy book I've read that provides one with a better example of what the study of philosophy is like.  <br />Other introductions to philosophy are usually of two sorts.  One provides you with a fairly superficial account of the main ideas of the most famous philosophers, and the other consists of a philosopher presenting his or her own views in such a way that they're accessible to those without prior knowledge of philosophy.  Books of both these sorts have value to those coming to philosophy for the first time, but neither gives an accurate picture of what it's like to study philosophy.  Those of the first sort suggest that the study of philosophy is part of the study of the history of ideas, and this isn't the case.  Philosophers are concerned with the work of great historical figures in their field.  But they're concerned with this work as a repository of ideas and insights that are worthy of being defended today, and not only as evidence of historical trends in the study of their subject.  And books of the second sort often fail to provide one with a sense of the range of arguments and positions available on any philosophical topic.  The writers of these books are usually more interested in introducing the reader to their own views than in introducing the reader to philosophical thinking, and they're knowledgeable enough to know where the weaknesses in their views are and how to hide them (or at least avoid topics that are likely to bring these weaknesses to the reader's attention).  Moreover, works of this sort tend to suggest that philosophy is a body of widely accepted views about certain subjects, and that is very misleading.<br />Basically, the study of philosophy is the study of arguments, and this is a book about the sorts of arguments philosophers study.  But what sorts of arguments are philosophers interested in?  For the most part, they're interested in arguments people have given on topics where it's not clear we have the ability to settle disputes by scientific means.  That is, philosophy tries to help us understand the world just by thinking about it.  Or, at least, philosophy asks and responds to questions that are so general and abstract that it's not clear we can discover answers to them by going out into the world and observing something or conducting an experiment.  (For better of worse, questions about what, exactly, philosophers study and what methods they should employ are questions that it seems only philosophy itself is suited to answer.  And while philosophers tend to agree about which questions they should be thinking about, they disagree about just why those are the right questions and how one can go about answering them (if they think there are such answers).)  What sorts of questions are these?  Warburton focuses on the following:  Does God exist?  What is the nature of right and wrong?  Can we know anything about the world outside our minds?  How is the mind related to the body?  What reasons, if any, do we have for thinking that science provides us with a true account of the physical world?  <br />Warburton's book discusses some of the most important and influential arguments philosophers have developed on these subjects along with the most important and influential objections to those arguments.  The book's structure is actually rather simple:  Warburton introduces a topic; he presents an argument for some important view on that topic; he then presents some objections to that argument; this is followed by the introduction of a new view that develops in response to those objections; he then presents arguments for this second views; then objections to this second view; and so on.  <br />What is especially exciting about this book isthat everything extraneous is removed from its presentation of the ideas under consideration.  It's one hundred and fifty pages of really interesting ideas (and other really interesting ideas formed in response to those ideas) presented as clearly and succinctly as possible, and it's extensive enough in its coverage to give you some sense of the range of possible that are available to people thinking about these questions.  In less than an hour with this book, you can get an introduction to the most significant arguments philosophers have developed concerning, say, the existence of God.  The book gives you just enough information to whet your appetite for more and to prepare you for study of these issues in more detail.  Furthermore, and importantly, the book aims to introduce the reader to many of the major areas of philosophy, including including metaphysics, epistemology (the theory of knowledge), ethics, and political philosophy.  <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for an introduction to philosophy.	2004-02-23

The conversations are easy to follow; no knowledge of arcane terminology is presupposed; and every attempt is made to bring out why these ideas are important and worthy of serious study today.  Furthermore, the book's coverage is quite broad for its length of three hundred pages.  It manages to cover philosophy from Plato to Wittgenstein, and I can't think of a single absolutely essential figure in the history of philosophy whose work isn't discussed here.  Nevertheless, this book is less ambitious than many other shorter books on the history of philosophy in that it doesn't attempt to cover the entire history of philosophy.  Instead, Magee and his interlocutors focus in on the most important figures in the history of philosophy and devote an entire chapter to each of them.  Where historical trends in philosophy or other, less important figures are mentioned, they're mentioned in relation to the figures to whom the particular chapters are devoted.  This strikes me as a significant strength of this book as a book for someone coming to philosophy for the first time.  A beginner needs to know about Plato, Descartes, Hume, Kant, et al.; she doesn't need to know a little bit about every figure who has introduced an important idea or two. Finally, most of the interviews are with thinkers who are themselves good philosophers, and, in several cases (e.g., Bernard Williams on Descartes, Miles Burnyeat on Plato, Michael Ayers on Locke, and Hubert Dreyfus on Heidegger), the interviewee has done first-rate work on the very philosopher(s) he or she is discussing.  <br />Each interview begins with a short biographical sketch of the subject by Brian Magee, and some attempt is made, in these introductions and in the interviews, to place each figure's ideas into the history of philosophy and into the history of ideas more generally.  Still, there isno general format for these discussions.  Some of the interviews begin with a sketch of the thinker's methodology or conception of philosophy; some begin with an account of one of the thinker's distinctive views that provides an entry into his thinking; some begin with a discussion of a problem to which the thinker was responding.  From these beginnings, the conversation tends to develop and cover more of the thinker's views, with the dialogue format keeping things fairly informal without being superficial.  <br />It's not that this book makes all of these things easy to understand.  Some of them just aren't easy to understand, and there is no way to accurately describe their views while making those views easy to understand.  And, in some cases, the difficulty of their views isn't simply a matter of unnecessary pedantry or willful obscurity on their part--though, in other cases, it may be partly a matter of these things.  In fact, some of these figures (i.e., Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein) are notorious for the difficulty of their work.  But, even in these cases, the conversations here go some way in helping to introduce their thought.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants an entry into the study of the history of the philosophy.  In addition, if you simply memorize most of the information in this volume, you'll know enough to understand just about any reference to a famous philosopher and his ideas that you find outside of a philosophy classroom or journal.  In other words, you'll look smarter if you read this book.  Heck, reading this book might even make you smarter.  What more can you ask for?	2004-02-23

Chapters 5-7, I think, constitute the best introduction to Blackburn's quasi-realism.  As a matter of fact, these chapters may constitute the best expression of the nature of, and motivations for, the quasi-realist project that Blackburn has published.  (Ruling Passions is more detailed and expansive, but it's also evasive and frustratingly unclear in parts; this book is much clearer and more direct.  The papers in Essays in Quasi-Realism are good, but they're aimed at those already working on these subjects; this book, while not an easy read, doesn't assume the reader is coming to it with this sort of background.)<br />Chapter 5 is Blackburn's introduction to issues concerning language and realism, and Blackburn uses debates about moral realism as his example of an area where linguistic issues are appealed to as providing evidence for an against certain forms of realism and anti-realism.  The chapter involves a brief introduction to the sort of noncognitivist expressivism he favors.  According to Blackburn, we can best understand moral judgments as expressions of our attitudes.  This sort of noncognitivism, he argues, provides us with the best account of the nature, which is not best understood as language used to respond to some moral aspect of reality (as language about ordinary physical objects is best understood as responding to things outside our minds and the properties they possess).  To the extent that we can legitimately speak of a moral aspect of reality, of the moral properties of things, they are projections of our attitudes; they're &quot;out there&quot; in virtue of our spreading our attitudes onto the world.<br />Chapter 6 begins with a discussions of some benefits of a projective theory of moral judgments.  Blackburn claims there are three such benefits his theory provides:  (i) metaphysical and epistemological simplicity, in that projectivism allows us to understand moral discourse without appealing to special moral properties and a special faculty for knowing them, things which, it seems, wouldn't have a place in a respectable naturalistic account of the world and of human psychology; (ii) a explanation of the supervenience of the moral properties of things on their natural properties better than any explanation a realist can offer; and (iii) an explanation of the intimate connection between a person's moral judgments and her motivations to behave in accord with those judgments.<br />Having sketched the outlines of his projectivist theory of moral discourse and some reasons to prefer it to its rivals, Blackburn turns to an apparent dilemma facing the projectivist (and noncognitivists more generally).  The dilemma is that the projectivist seems to be committed to either declaring that moral discourse is subject to a pervasive error or abandoning projectivism and accepting a form of realism.  Why?  In short, the reason is that the structure of moral discourse is realist in nature.  When we say that something is morally right or wrong, it appears that we are talking about properties of things that are out there, irrespective of human attitudes.  We speak of moral claims being true and false, and we claim that people's moral views are occasionally wrong.  We talk about what the moral facts are.  All of this makes it seem that we're talking about moral facts that exist independently of us.  If you go simply by the way we talk about morality, we don't see any difference between such language and how we talk about everyday physical objects.<br />But the expressivist tells us that there is a major difference here:  talk about morality, unlike talk about everyday physical objects, is a means of expressing attitudes and doesn't even purport to describe mind-independent facts.  So it looks like the projectivist is stuck.  If she defends moral discourse against accusations that it is predicated upon an error, she seems to be committed to realism (i.e. to the view that there are moral facts, and that our moral discourse describes them) and to its, perhaps implausible, metaphysical and epistemological commitments.  If she repudiates the appearance of moral discourse, then it appears the projectivist is telling us that people are mistakenly committed to realism though their use of ordinary moral language.  Through the things they normally say using moral language, it appears that people erroneously think that there's something out there for moral language to describe, that moral claims can be literally true and false, and that the truth and falsity of moral claims is independent of facts about their attitudes.<br />Blackburn wants to avoid both both realism and an error-theoretic account of morality, and his quasi-realist project is the project of attempting to show that a projectivist can do so.  That is, quasi-realism is the project of explaining and justifying the realist-seeming structure of moral thought and discourse on projectivist grounds<br />Why, if projectivism is true, do we use language that is realist?  And why should we do so?  In the rest of chapter 6 and in chapter 7, Blackburn deals with these questions.  He presents certain elements of moral thought and language that seem to conflict with his projective theory of moral thought and language, and he tries to account for them on projective grounds.  He's especially concerned with three thing:  (i) The Frege-Geach problem:  that is, the problem of accounting for the appearance of moral sentences in unasserted contexts; (ii) the application of truth and falsity to moral sentences; and (iii) the mind-independence of moral truth and falsity.<br />By accounting for these aspects of moral thought and language with projectivist resources, he hopes to provide some evidence that the quasi-realist project will be wholly successful.predicated upon an error, she seems to be committed to realism (i.e. to the view that there are moral facts, and that our moral discourse describes them) and to its, perhaps implausible, metaphysical and epistemological commitments.

A signal virtue of this book is that it provides an introduction to the history of ethical theory as well as contemporary issues in meta-ethics and normative ethics.    <br />The book begins with a section on meta-ethics; this section is written as a philosophical textbook.  It consists of several short chapters, each of which is concerned with one of the positions that has been defended in contemporary meta-ethics.  The following positions are discussed:  naturalist realism, theological voluntarism, ideal observer theories, noncognitivism, error theories, relativism, and intuitionism.  As anyone familiar with work of this sort will know, each of these chapters includes a brief introduction to the main elements of a position and analysis of a few objections to that position.  Darwall keeps this chapters short--most are between five and ten pages--and he does so by writing very compressed prose.  He manages to at least mention most of the important objections to these views, and he do so in such a concise manner by limiting his discussion of most of these objections to merely a paragraph or two.  Needless to say, this leaves a lot to be said.  But it has its benefits, too.  It makes the book an excellent reference book on these particular views, as one can pick up the book and review the main objections to some theory in only a few minutes.  Moreover, it leaves the beginner with something to think about.  He or she is left to think about the plausibility of these views, and the force of the objections to them, without having to work through pages and pages of summary of the literature on these issues.<br />In short, the chapters of the book's first section are about what you would expect from good introductory lectures on these topics:  they provide you with the basic elements of the view and some sense of its strenghts and weaknesses.<br />The second section of the book is an introduction to issues in normative ethics.  But the introduction here is different from the introduction to meta-ethics in that it is historical in character.  Rather than devoting an individual chapter to each view that is popular in the contemporary literature, Darwall presents and analyzes the views of famous figures in the history of ethics.  But this isn't exactly an introduction to the history of ethics, either; it's a series of extended discussions of major historical figures who provide paradigmatic examples of the main positions in normative ethics.  Kant is discussed as an example of deontology, Mill as an example of consequentialism, Hobbes as an example of contractualism, Aristotle as an example of virtue theory, and Nietzsche as an example of someone skeptical of the very notion of morality.  <br />So Darwall is concerned with general outlines of these thinkers views and their contemporary relevance, and not with their views as historical relics or as examples of historical trends in ethical thought.  What is valuable about this way of approaching normative ethics is that it reflects that fact that historically important figures in philosophy aren't of interest only to historians of the subject; some of their views are genuine competitors in the current debate, and more current theories can be understood as developing in response to objections to the views of these earlier figures.  <br />This is an excellent book for those approaching normative ethics and meta-ethics for the first time, and I think it would also serve as a useful resource for those coming to it with prior knowledge of the subject.  Having some background in philosophy (though not necessarily in ethics) wouldn't hurt readers of this book, but I doubt that it's necessary.	2004-02-22
US	23395896	R2SBLALSV9WIB	0521448484	681299447	Principia Ethica	Books	5	17	19	N	N	A Seminal Text in Twentieth-Century Philosophy	Moore's Principia Ethica is a central text in twentieth-century meta-ethics.  According to the familiar history of the subject, the story of much of twentieth-century meta-ethics can be understood as a series of reactions to this book.  In this book Moore argues for non-naturalistic intuitionism.  He argues that moral properties are an irreducible part of reality, and that they are sui generis.  And he argues that we can acquire knowledge of these sui generis moral properties only through intuition.<br />The first chapter includes Moore's famous Open Question Argument, his argument that intrinsic goodness is a simple, unanalyzable, non-natural property.  There appear to be two strands of the OQA; both of them appeal to our linguistic intuitions.  The first focuses on our intuitions about whether certain claims about intrinsic goodness are tautological.  Borrowing Moore's own example, suppose someone tries to define 'good' as 'what is pleasant'.  All competent users of the language can see that this definition must fail.  How?  They simply need to ask themselves if &quot;the good is what is pleasant&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;the pleasant is what is pleasant,&quot; for these two sentences would be synonymous if 'good' could be correctly defined 'what is pleasant.'  And, Moore claims, these sentences clearly aren't synonymous:  the claim that &quot;the good is what is pleasant&quot; is not a tautology like &quot;the pleasant is pleasant.&quot;  This shows that 'good' and 'what is pleasant' have different meanings.  Furthermore, Moore argues that thinking about other examples will show that, in principle, we could develop that a structurally similar argument against any other attempted definition of 'good'.<br />The second strand of the argument draws on our intuitions about what is and is not an open question.  If 'what is pleasant' is a correct definition of 'good', then the following should not be an open question:  Is what is pleasant good?  For, if the proposed definition is correct, then it is true by definition that this what is pleasant is good.  But, Moore asserts, competent users of the language don't think it's true by definition that what is pleasant is good; they do, and should, regard this question as an open one.  It might be true that what is pleasant is good--but, importantly, it is not true by definition.  Again, Moore argues that a similar argument will show that any other attempted definition of 'good' fails.<br />The conclusions Moore draws from the OQA are that the term 'good' is indefinable, and that goodness is a simple and unanalyzable property.  It is somewhat unclear how Moore thinks he can draw any metaphysical conclusion from this argument, but he seems to have reasoned in the following way.  If goodness were identical to some natural or metaphysical property, it would be definable in terms of some natural or metaphysical predicate.  The OQA shows that it is not definable in this way, and so it shows that goodness is not identical to a property of either of these types.  Moore also provides a label for the error made by those who don't understand the nature of intrinsic goodness:  they commit &quot;the naturalistic fallacy.&quot;  The naturalistic fallacy is committed by anyone who identifies intrinsic goodness with some other property, and Moore claims that nearly all previous ethicists have committed this fallacy.  <br />The Preface involves a very brief sketch of Moore's epistemological views, views that he apparently thinks follow from his conclusions about the nature of intrinsic goodness.  Moore claims that knowledge of intrinsic goodness can be acquired only through intuitions.  There is no non-intuitional evidence for propositions about the intrinsic goodness of things, and they cannot be deduced from any other propositions.  How, then, do we come to know these things?  We think very carefully about them, ensure that we don't confuse these propositions with other, and then we have anintuition of the proposition's truth or we don't. <br />The final two chapters are concerned with issues in normative ethics.  The substantive moral theory he defends is a form of act-consequentialism.  According to Moore, in all situations, the action one ought to perform is the action that will result in the greatest net amount of intrinsic goodness in the world.  In the fifth chapter, he discusses what practical conclusions one can draw from this account of right action.  He argues for a fairly extreme form of moral conservatism according to which we have good reason to act on the principles constituting conventional morality almost all the time.  For we simply don't know enough about the consequences of the possible actions available to us to discover which of them will lead to the greatest amount of net intrinsic goodness.  Given our ignorance of these matters, what we ought to do is follow most of the common moral rules in our community.  (Moore does allow for exceptions in a limited number of cases, however.)<br />The sixth and final chapter includes Moore's discussion of which things are intrinsically good.  He argues that two things, aesthetic enjoyment and personal affection, are the most intrinsically good of intrinsically good things.  <br />For the most part, this isn't an exciting book.  It's filled with the sort of philosophizing one expects from Moore:  close reading, lots of subtle distinctions, and patient and careful analysis.  His work is slow and painstaking--that's a given.  And, to be honest, this book is occasionally dull.  But Moore's scrupulous attention to detail doesn't preclude insight and interesting ideas.  Nor does it bury them in pages and pages of tedious nit-picking and quibbling.  <br />For students of meta-ethics and anyone interested in the history of twentieth-century ethical thought, this is mandatory reading.  <br />Concerning the revised edition of Principia, edited by Thomas Baldwin.  The buyer should know that the text ofPrincipia is unedited in this edition.  However, there are reasons to prefer this edition to cheaper alternatives.  First, and most importantly, this edition includes the so-called &quot;Preface to the Second Edition,&quot; which consists of Moore's later misgivings about the first chapter of Principia.  (Moore never published this preface in his lifetime.)  He doesn't repudiate his substantial conclusions there, but he raises issues about the statement of those conclusions and the arguments he provided for them. If you're interested in serious study of Principia, knowledge of this preface is crucially important.  Second, this edition includes Moore's paper &quot;The Conception of Intrinsic Value,&quot; which helps to clarify his views about the nature of intrinsic goodness.  Third, Baldwin includes a helpful editor's introduction for this edition.	2004-02-21

Brink argues that there are moral facts, and that these facts are (in some important sense) independent of human thought.  He also argues that our moral claims purport to describe such facts, and that we are often successful in doing so.  Finally, he argues that moral knowledge is possible, and that we possess a good deal of it.<br />This is an important book in contemporary meta-ethics since it is the first and only book-length treatise on so-called &quot;Cornell Realism.&quot;  What is perhaps most distinctive of the Cornell Realists is that they draw on work in recent philosophy of science to argue that we have good reason to believe that moral inquiry is objective in much the same way that scientific inquiry is objective.  They also adhere to a battery of views on specific meta-ethical issues, and this helps to distinguish them from other thinkers.  At the center of their metaphysics of morality is the view that moral facts and properties are natural, though they cannot be reduced to the properties of physics, biology, chemistry, or any other discipline in the natural sciences.  They favor a semantics of moral discourse according to which moral terms cannot be wholly analyzed into the language of other disciplines.  They defend a coherentist moral epistemology, and they argue that the Rawlsian method of reflective equilibrium is a discovery procedure employed in both ethics and the sciences.  Finally, they defend externalism about motivation and reasons for action.  In his book Brink defends all of these positions.<br />Since there's no point in trying to analyze Brink's arguments in a review of this length, I'll simply try to say something about the overall structure of the book and how it relates to Brink's project.  He begins by distinguishing moral realism from its noncognitivist and constructivist competitors, and he argues that many of our common-sense beliefs about moral language and inquiry provide evidence for realism.  Brink also argues that, pace certain anti-realists, the choice between realism and anti-realism does have some effect on our normative practices.  These conclusions, he thinks, provide some prima facie evidence for moral realism.  Unless the anti-realist can show that there is something seriously wrong with realism, there is good reason to accept realism.<br />Brink then argues that his form of realism can provide a plausible account of morality, and that it isn't undermined by certain well-known objections to realism.  He begins by developing his views on moral epistemology and the practical aspects of morality.  He then considers some objections to moral realism.  The first objection is one based on the is/ought thesis, the thesis that moral statements cannot be derived from non-moral ones.  Brink argues that this thesis, even if it is true, does not undermine realism, as this sort of inferential gap is present in other areas as well.  This is followed by a chapter on a posteriori objections to moral realism.  Most of this chapter is devoted to answering worries about the objectivity of morality that have been developed by J. L. Mackie and Gilbert Harman.  He argues that Mackie's argument from queerness fails because moral facts are natural facts and because moral facts don't involve any intrinsic and categorical prescriptivity.  In response to Mackie's other argument for anti-realism, the argument from disagreement, he argues that the nonexistence of moral facts isn't clearly the best explanation of the existence and persistence of moral disagreement.  Finally, he argues that Harman is wrong to think that moral facts are explanatorily irrelevant.<br />The virtues of Brink's book are the characteristic virtues of good analytic philosophy.  On all of the topics he discusses, Brink's arguments are admirably clear.  He's patient in his analysis and criticism of arguments, and he draws on a substantial amount of literature on these topics in formulating his views and distinguishing them from other approaches.  Furthermore, he's often willing to point out areas of his argument that might not be especially compelling and that leave room for proponents of views other than the one he prefers.<br />The book ends with an extended account of the outlines of the sort of teleological normative theory Brink defends as both independently plausible and consistent with his version of moral realism.<br />This book should be accessible to anyone with some background in meta-ethics, though it seems clearly intended for those who specialize in these areas.  The work doesn't presuppose a lot of knowledge of the details of this debate--and Brink is very good at providing an account of the issues, their importance, and other positions before he presents his own views--but the comprehensiveness and intricacy of the book's arguments suggest that its intended audience is those who are students of meta-ethics.<br />For those studying the realism/anti-realism debate in meta-ethics, this book is essential reading.  And for anyone seriously concerned with issues pertaining to the objectivity of morality, I recommend this book as an example of one approach to these issues.<br />(And one might want to compare this to Russ Shafer-Landau's recent book, Moral Realism:  A Defense.  That book is similar in scope to Brink's, and it covers much of the same ground.  In some ways, Shafer-Landau's book can be seen as an update to Brink's.  For, like Brink's book, it includes a comprehensive defense of realism that involves a comparison of realism's virtues with the supposed weaknesses of its most important competitors and an attempt to deal with the most important objections to realism that have been raised by other philosophers.  But, while the two agree on quite a bit, Shafer-Landau argues for a form of non-naturalism about moral facts and for a reliabilist account of moral epistemology.)	2004-02-21

One strength of this anthology is its breadth.  It covers influential work concerning apparent problems for the objectivity of morality; responses to these problems provided by realists, noncognitivists, sensibility theorists, and constructivists; and, unlike many anthologies covering meta-ethics, it includes a section devoted the practical dimension of morality.  Another strength is the quality of the work represented here.  Nearly every paper included is a contemporary classic that should be read by everyone interested in meta-ethics.  Finally, the paper includes a top-notch introduction to the issues.  <br />The anthology opens with that introduction--DGR's \\"Toward Fin de siecle Ethics:  Some Trends,\\" which originally appeared in the centennial edition of the Philosophical Review.  This long paper, published in 1993 and intended to give readers an overview of the then-current state of debate in meta-ethics, is an excellent introduction to the issues covered in the anthology.  Indeed, the rest of the volume is built around this paper.  The paper opens with a very helpful, albeit short, introduction to the history of meta-ethics in the twentieth century.  G. E. Moore's Open Question Argument sets the process of twentieth-century meta-ethics in motion; noncognitivism appears as a response to the perceived inadequacies of Moorean realist intuitionism; and the various contemporary views in meta-ethics arise in response to a renewed interest in normative ethics in the last quarter of the twentieth century.  Following this historical introduction, the majority of the paper is devoted to the contemporary scene in meta-ethics.  It includes brief sketches of the basic ideas of most of the competitors available:  reductive naturalistic realism, non-reductive naturalistic realism, Foot's neo-Aristotelianism, practical reasoning theories, noncognitivism, constructivism, and sensibility theories.  DGR don't go into detail about all these competitors, but their paper provides a useful taxonomy of views and a sense of their relations to one another.  <br />The first part of the anthology covers certain putative problems with understanding morality as objective.  In particular, the focus is on the relation between facts and values.  The section opens with the sections from Moore's Principia Ethica in which he develops the OQA; this selection, it seems, is presented as a way to draw out our intuitions about a fact/value gap.  Moore wants to retain the view that value claims are factual, though they're a very special sort of fact.  Wittgenstein, in the next paper, develops his intuitions about the fact/value gap in a direction that moves him closer to the view that value judgments aren't really factual judgments at all.  Then we see these intuitions about the relations between facts and values taken up and transformed into noncognitivism by Charles Stevenson in his \\"The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms.\\"  According to the noncognitivists, not only is there a fact/value gap, but those who think value claims purport to describe value facts are the ones who are confused about the nature of morality.  This section concludes with two more recent arguments against the objectivity of ethics by J. L. Mackie and Gilbert Harman.  Unlike the noncognitivists, they take moral language at face-value and argue that moral claims do purport to describe special value facts.  However, they think there is a metaphysical problem with value claims--namely that we have good reason to think that the value facts they purport to describe simply don't exist.  So their worries about ethics are metaphysical:  the world isn't the way it would need to be for moral claims to be true.  <br />The anthology's next section covers various contemporary responses to these problems; it includes responses by  realists, noncognitivists,  sensibility theorists, constructivists.  Realists deny the existence of an important fact/value gap.  They argue that morality is objective:  that our moral language purports to describe moral facts, that there are moral facts with a mind-independent existence that our moral claims (at least) sometimes successfully describe, and that we can come to know that (at least) some moral claims are true.  The book include includes two very important wide-ranging papers by contemporary realists:  Peter Railton's \\"Moral Realism\\" and Richard Boyd's \\"How to Be a Moral Realist.\\"  Noncognitivists accept that there is a fact-value gap, but they deny that its existence shows that there is something problematic about ethics.  There aren't any value facts, but this isn't problematic since ethical language doesn't even purport to describe facts.  Instead, ethical language is used to express certain emotional or attitudinal states.  The work of two contemporary nocognitivists, Simon Blackburn and Allan Gibbard, is represented here.  (The Gibbard paper, which is a detailed summary of the argument of his book Wise Choices, Apt Feelings, is especially interesting, and I'm not sure that it has appeared anywhere else.)  Constructivists and sensibility theorists both argue that there are moral facts but that they are not mind-independent in the way realists claim.  Sensibility theorists argue that there are moral facts but that they are somehow dependent on the operation of special human sensibilities.  John McDowell, in one of the papers included here, draws an explicit analogy with facts about colors.  While it may be the case that things are not colored independently of our human experience of the world, it's still the case that there are facts about what colors certain things are.  Similarly, sensibility theorists argue, while there may not be moral values in the world independently of our special human ways of interacting with the world, it's still the case that there are value facts.  Constructivists argue that there are moral facts but that they are fixed by human beliefs or attitudes in some properly described situation.  That is, moral facts are constructed by people's moral opinions in some idealized situation, or by people's moral opinions that are arrived at through some appropriate process.  The anthology includes work from John Rawls, T. M. Scanlon, and Jurgen Habermas in which this central idea is developed<br />The book's final section is concerned with the practical dimension of morality.  What is the relation between moral demands and reasons for actions, between moral demands and motivation?  These issues are discussed in important work by Philippa Foot, David Gauthier, Christine Korsgaard, Thomas Nagel, and Bernard Williams.  Honestly, I don't know this material very well, but I'm familiar enough with the issues to know that all of these papers are ones that should be read by any student of meta-ethics.	2004-02-21

What is the realism/anti-realism dispute?  Sayre-McCord begins his volume with a twenty-page introduction that answers this question much better than I can in a few hundred words, but here's what I take to be at issue in the dispute.  <br />Basically, what is at issue between realists and anti-realists is the objectivity of ethics.  According to Sayre-McCord, the central issue is the existence of moral facts.  Realists claim that such facts exist; anti-realists deny their existence.  There is more to the debate than this, however.  The following is a list of claims that most realists will make about morality:  (i) there are moral facts (or moral truths), and these facts (or truths) are mind-independent in some important way; (ii) cognitivism about moral discourse is true:  that is, moral moral claims purport to describe moral facts (or moral truths), and (at least some of) these claims successfully do so; and (iii) moral knowledge is possible, and we have some of it.  <BR>  <BR>Importantly, though, anti-realists needn't deny all three of this claims.  In fact, there is an important divide in anti-realism between those anti-realists who are cognitivists and those who are noncognitivists.  Anti-realist cognitivists argue that moral discourse purports to describe moral facts, but that there are no such facts.  If there are no moral facts and cognitivism is true, then moral practice and discourse appears to involve a pervasive error, an error of attempting to talk about something that doesn't exist. Anti-realist noncognitivists, it seems, needn't accurse ordinary moral discourse and practice of any error.  Indeed, if cognitivism is false, then it is realists (and cognitivists more generally) who are guilty of an error.  Their error is one of having misunderstood the nature of moral discourse.  Moral claims don't even purport to describe reality;instead, they serve some other purpose, like expressing our attitudes, influencing the behavior of others, or prescribing certain types of action.<BR>  <BR>After his introduction, Sayre-McCord divides the anthology into two sections, each of which includes six papers.   The section on anti-realism begins with a classic defense of the doctrine from A. J. Ayer's Language, Truth, and Logic.  Ayer argues that moral realism conflicts with the tenets of his logical positivism and sketches a rather crude noncognitivist account of moral language.  Despite its age, this paper is important as a source of some important anti-realist arguments.  It's an early example of noncognitivists taking over Moore's Open Question Argument but rejecting his realist non-naturalist intuitionism as obscure and implausible. It's also an early example of anti-realists appealing to ethical disagreement and the difficulty of reaching moral consensus as evidence for their views.  This section of the anthology includes several interesting papers in addition to Ayer's.  In &quot;Supervenience Revisited,&quot; Simon Blackburn argues that realists have trouble dealing with the supervenience of the moral on the natural, and that this is better explained by noncognitivist accounts of moral discourse.  Sayre-McCord also includes work from J. L. Mackie and Gilbert Harman in which they present arguments for cognitivist forms of anti-realism.  In the first chapter of his Ethics:  Inventing Right and Wrong, Mackie argues that moral language and discourse purport to describe moral facts, but that we have good reason to think that no such facts exist since their existence would conflict with a naturalistic worldview.  Harman's argument, which comes from his The Nature of Morality, is that the problem with moral facts is that they appear to be immune to observational testing.  More generally, Harman's worry appears to be one about causal explanation:  it is not clear to him that moral facts have any role to play in the sorts of causal explanations that can be offered by appealing to scientific facts.  Since Harman takes the sciences to provide us with a model of objectivity, this makes putative moral facts suspect.<br />The section on realism includes some papers directly responding to the anti-realist arguments of the first section.  Nicholas Sturgeon's &quot;Moral Explanations&quot; attempts to rebut Harman's argument for anti-realism.  Sturgeon argues that at least some moral facts appear to be explanatory in just the way that Harman denies that they are.  (Sayre-McCord includes a paper of his own in which he responds to the Sturgeon-Harman debate.  He does so by questioning whether they've been debating the right question.)  John McDowell responds to Mackie's error theory in his &quot;Values and Secondary Qualities.&quot;  The central contention of his paper is that Mackie has misunderstood what moral facts would have to be like.  If we correctly understand the nature of moral facts, McDowell argues, we'll see that Mackie's metaphysical worries about realism aren't well-justified.  This section of the anthology also includes two long, exploratory papers that defend forms of realism, David Wiggins's &quot;Truth, Invention, and the Meaning of Life&quot; and Richard Boyd's &quot;How to Be a Moral Realist.&quot;  In the latter Richard Boyd argues that the putative disanalogy between science and morality, a disanalogy to which many anti-realists appeal, disappears when one properly understands science and the source of its objectivity.  <br />Of course, there are some other papers whose inclusion would have made this anthology even better.  Two that immediately come to mind are Peter Railton's &quot;Moral Realism&quot; and David Brink's &quot;Moral Realism and the Sceptical Arguments from Disagreement and Queerness.&quot;  Nevertheless, the papers Sayre-McCord has chosen provide a good overview of the positions available to those in the debate and how those positions can be defended and criticized.  And that, I suppose, is what a good anthology should do.     <br />I should note that a lot of the material in this anthology is also present in Darwall, Gibbard, and Railton's Moral Discourse and Practice, an anthology intended to cover a wider range of issues in meta-ethics.  If you're especially interested in the realism/anti-realism debate, the Sayre-McCord is probably the better of the two volumes.  If your interest in meta-ethics is more general, however, then you might want to consider the Darwall, Gibbard, and Railton.	2004-02-20

Do moral truths require the existence of God?  Do we need a robust sort of free will in order to be morally responsible for what we do?).  <br />The book covers what are currently taken to be the big three positions in normative ethics:  utilitarianism (and consequentialism more generally), deontology, and virtue ethics.  (There's no section on contractualism/contractarianism, though there are selections from Gauthier, Harman, Hobbes, and Kant.  So some of the relevant literature is present here.)  These sections include a few papers defending each position, a few papers criticizing them, and in some cases responses to those criticisms.  Of the three sections, the one on utilitarianism is the best and most comprehensive.  The sections on deontology and virtue ethics are less comprehensive, but they're still good enough to provide an introduction to those positions and some significant objections to them.<br />The book's coverage of issues in meta-ethics is perhaps better than its coverage of issues in normative ethics.  Pojman has included sections on several issues in meta-ethics, including relativism, the nature of value, realism vs. antirealism, and a section on positions on the fact/value distinction.  This last section serves two distinct purposes:  it introduces the debate between cognitivists and noncognitivists, and it provides a brief outline of the history of twentieth-century meta-ethical debate.  The section begins with some passages from Hume's treatise concerning the respective roles of reason and emotion in ethics, it then covers several of the most important and influential positions in twentieth-century meta-ethics:  Moore's intuitionist non-naturalism is represented by some passages from Principia in which he presents the Open Question Argument; Ayer's emotivism is represented by his defense of that position in Language, Truth, and Language; Hare's prescriptivism is presented in a short introductory to his views; and the naturalistic rejoinder to these meta-ethical views is represented by some work of Geoffrey Warnock.<br />The section on the realism/anti-realism debate is centered on contemporary work.  This section doesn't include anything from contemporary defenders of noncognitivism; instead, it is set up as a debate between cognitivists who defend realism and those who defend anti-realism.  This section includes classic anti-realist arguments from Mackie, Harman, and Williams along with responses to each of their arguments, and it concludes with the final chapter from Smith's The Moral Problem.<br />The book's coverage of issues concerning morality that aren't part of the areas discussed above is somewhat less consistent.  (This is no doubt due, at least in part, to an attempt to cover quite a bit in a limited amount of space.)  Other issues covered include the relation between morality and self-interest, the relation between morality and religion, freedom of the will, feministic ethics, and sociobiology.  None of these issues is covered as extensively as any of the issues mentioned above, and the coverage of some of them consists of only a couple of papers.  Still, the papers included do allow one to get some sense of the issues in these areas.<br />The book also includes some not very extensive historical coverage.  Pojman has included something from several of the historical figures who are considered absolute essential in philosophical study of ethics.  So you've got your Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, and Mill.  (It is worth noting that, where translations are necessary, the translations are mostly older ones, like Jowett's translations of Plato's Crito, Euthyphro, and The Republic; Ross's translation of Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics; and Paton's translation of Kant's Groundwork.)  The book attempts to integrate these historical figures into its discussion of particular subjects, and it does so by treating the works of these figures as introductions to the issues.  Consequently, the first reading in most of the book's sections is from a historically important philosopher.  Mill gets the first word on utilitarianism; Hobbes on egoism; Aristotle on virtue ethics; etc.  There's enough historical coverage here to give people a flavor of the major figures' views, but this book certainly isn't intended an anthology for a course in the history of ethics.  In fact, nearly all the readings come from twentieth century figures.  <br />If there is a noteworthy problem with this anthology, it's that some of its sections are rather superficial.  In particular, the section on relativism and the section on the relation between morality and religion are underdeveloped.  Both of these are shorter sections, and some of the the papers in these sections simply aren't very good philosophy.  Those looking to understand the debates in these areas will probably have to look to other readings on these topics.  In addition, the section on egoism is pretty small--though the individual papers in that section are all good.<br />These relatively minor worries shouldn't dissuade people from using this book, however, as its coverage in all other areas is more than adequate.  The book is well-suited for use in survey courses in ethics that are aimed at undergraduate students, especially if one intends to cover issues in both normative ethics and meta-ethics.	2004-02-19

There he argues that ordinary moral discourse and thought involve an assumption that there are what he calls \\"objective values,\\" and that this assumption is false.  Consequently, ordinary moral thought and language are infected by an error that precludes any ordinary moral claims and thoughts from being true.  <br />Mackie first argues for a cognitivist interpretation of moral language.  In other words, he argues that ordinary moral claims purport to describe facts about the world.  In particular, ordinary moral language and thought purport to describe facts about objective moral values.  What are objective moral values?  They have two defining characteristics:  (i) mind-independent existence (think of how chairs, trees, people, and electrons exist), and (ii) \\"intrinsic and categorical prescriptivity\\":  that is, they are such that the mere apprehension of them will motivate a person to act in a certain way.  The former characteristic is the source of their objectivity; the latter is the source of their normativity.<br />But, he claims, we have good reason to think that no such things exist.  Mackie's fundamental worry about these putative objective values is that these things are especially \\"queer,\\" that they are unlike any other things we have good reason to think exist.  As I understand Mackie, underlying his worries about the queerness of these putative entities is his perception of a tension in their nature.  He appears to believe that the objectivity of these putative entities is in tension with their intrinsic and categorical action-guidingness.  That is, it is unclear to Mackie how something that exists as a mind-independent part of reality could have the sort of influence on human behavior that these objective values are supposed to have.  It is unclear how something could be both objective and normative.  The things that scientists study and that we encounter in the everyday world simply don't have this sort of categorical action-guidingness built into them.  So, given the naturalistic conception of the world that Mackie favors, we have good a posteriori reasons to doubt the existence of objective moral values.<br />But, if Mackie is correct about the nature of ordinary moral thought and language, this commits us to regarding ordinary moral thought and language as involving a very fundamental sort of error, an error of presupposing that objective moral values exist.  Mackie then completes his error theory by providing an explanation of our tendency to make this error, to mistakenly suppose that ordinary moral thought and language involve our successfully coming to know about the sorts of things he claims don't exist.<br />Mackie's book doesn't end here, however.  Indeed, this is only the first chapter, and Mackie goes on to cover a wide range of territory in normative ethics and meta-ethics, along with a few issues in metaphysics (the existence of God and freedom of the will) that have some bearing on moral issues.  In fact, despite his worries about the objectivity of morality, Mackie goes on to defend a substitute for morality, one that looks quite a bit like a broadly consequentialist moral theory, and he even weighs in on several controversial moral issues that are still with us.  In short, in a little over two hundred pages of exceptionally clear prose, Mackie covers just about everything of interest in moral philosophy.  <br />This book is, of course, essential reading for anyone interested in meta-ethics.  Understanding some of the material and its importance may require some background knowledge, but enough of the book is more generally accessible that it also constitutes a good wide-ranging introduction to issues in both meta-ethics and normative ethics for a person with some background in philosophy (and perhaps for the general reader).  Furthermore, the book, while not a work of history, is sufficiently informed about the history of the issues it discusses to provide the reader with an entry into study of the history of the subject.<br />If you're especially interested in Mackie's meta-ethical views, you should attempt to track down a copy of Morality and Objectivity (Ted Honderich, ed.), as it includes interesting and important reactions to Mackie's views by some major names (John McDowell, Simon Blackburn, R. M. Hare, Bernard Williams, et al.) in moral philosophy.	2004-02-17

Then this is the book for you.  If you've got about two hours, you can introduce yourself to intuitionism, emotivism, prescriptivism, and some worries about all of them.  If you're too lazy to do that much work, I'll give you sketch of the story in the next few paragraphs.<br />Our story begins, as do nearly all stories about meta-ethics in this period, with G. E. Moore and his Principia Ethica.  Moore's Principia defends of a particularly puzzling and problematic form of moral realism, non-naturalist intuitionism, and includes his famous Open Question Argument.  In Warnock's presentation,  what is important about Moore's book is the nature of his conclusions and not the details of his arguments.  Of particular importance is the fact that Moore's position commits him to not having a great deal of positive and substantive things to say about the fundamental questions of ethics.  Moore's distinctive meta-ethical conclusions are the following:  that certain basic ethical terms cannot be defined (at least by non-moral terms); that ethical properties aren't natural; and that ethical knowledge isn't based on anything other than careful consideration of ethical claims.  However, Moore doesn't end up with much of a positive view about the metaphysics or epistemology of ethics.  One wants from Moore an answer to questions like the following:  What exactly do we mean to be saying about something when we call it morally good (or bad)?  What are moral properties like if they aren't natural?  How could we possibly come to know anything about them, and do we have a special faculty that allows us to detect them?  But Moore has nothing edifying to say about these matters.  Indeed, the core of his view seems to be that there just isn't much to be said about these things.  <br />According to Warnock, the problem with intuitionism is not so much that it involves implausible metaphysical and epistemological views, but that it provides us with a view of moral language and practice on which they have no significant content.  The second part of our story is concerned with emotivism, which, according to Warnock, was a fairly natural reaction to the emptiness of intuitionism.  A rejection of views of this sort gave rise to various forms of noncognitivism found in the logical positivists (Schlick, Carnap, and Ayer), Stevenson, et al. that dominated English-language meta-ethics in the middle of the twentieth century.  These philosophers rejected Moore's non-naturalist metaphysics and intuitionist epistemology as inconsistent with empiricism and a naturalistic conception of the world.  They also rejected moral realism because they thought Moore's OQA, or something similar to it, showed that realism was committed to defending those doctrines of Moore's that they found untenable (and perhaps incredible).  The route out of the metaphysical and epistemological problems relating to morality, they thought, was to be found in a distinctive account of the nature of moral language  In particular, the emotivists argued that moral language is used to express our emotions and attitudes, and not to describe putative moral facts.  However, the noncognitivists ended up running into all sorts of problems in accounting for our ordinary beliefs about ways in which moral language can be used, the possibility of moral knowledge, the existence of correct answers to more questions, and the objectivity of morality.  <br />Warnock is especially concerned with the problem that the emotivist is apparently unable to account for the rationality of moral argument.  If moral debate is simply a matter of trading emotional expressions back and forth, it is unclear that we can formulate any conception of what constitutes a good moral argument.  In fact, we may end up with a crude position according to which a good moral argument is simply one that is effective, and this seems tobe a position that precludes distinguishing moral argumentation from propaganda.     <br />And this problem for emotivism leads Warnock to a consideration of the prescriptivism of R. M. Hare, one of whose goals was to formulate a form of noncognitivism that allowed for rational disputation about moral issues.  According to Hare, moral judgments are universal prescriptions.  They are prescriptive insofar as genuine acceptance of these judgments commits one to acting in a certain way, and they are universal insofar as one cannot accept these judgments in one case without accepting them in all relevantly similar cases.  This view, Hare thinks, allows for rational debate in ethics, since we can convict people of irrationality if (i) their moral judgments involve conflicting prescriptions or (ii) they apply their judgments in ways inconsistent with the universalizability of moral judgments.  Warnock's response is that this simply isn't enough to get us all the rationality we want in moral debate, and that, even if it were, Hare is still committed to the unworkable aim of reducing the variety of moral discourse in such a way that all of it can be understood as centered around the usage of universal prescriptions.  <br />That's the first two-thirds of Warnock's book, and it's a model of succinctness in philosophical exposition and criticism.  (If you want a work that covers this period in more detail, there are several out there.  Some I know of are Mary Warnock's Ethics Since 1900, W. D. Hudson's Modern Moral Philosophy, and Roger Hancock's Twentieth Century Ethics.  I haven't read these works, however, and so I make no claims for their quality.)  As Warnock himself points out, these parts of his book are almost wholly negative since he thinks there is little worth salvaging in the various positions he discusses.  But he isn't being captious, and I find his misgivings about the views he discusses to be well-founded.<br />In the final third of the book, Warnock abandons historical narrative and focuses on developing the rudiments of a naturalistic conception of ethics.  <br />This book is probably accessible to anyone with interest in the subject, though some background in ethics wouldn't hurt.	2004-02-17

The book is structured around two basic debates within the field:  the debate between cognitivists and noncognitivists, and the debate between realists and anti-realists.<br />The presentation of the material reflects the canned history of twentieth-century meta-ethics that should be familiar to anyone with some knowledge of the area.  Our story begins with G. E. Moore's Principia Ethica, which is the subject of the second chapter of Miller's book.  Moore's Principia (along with the work of Prichard, Ross, et al.) involves a defense of a particularly puzzling and problematic form of moral realism, namely non-naturalist intuitionism, and includes his famous Open Question Argument, which is the focus of Miller's chapter.<br />The second part of our story, and the remainder of Miller's book, begins with a backlash against Moore.  Moore's non-naturalist intuitionism included the following views:  that central components of moral language are indefinable, that moral facts can only be known as self-evident intuitions, and that moral properties are sui generis and not reducible to natural properties.  A rejection of views of this sort gave rise to various forms of noncognitivism found in Ayer (who is Miller's representative of early noncognitivism), Stevenson, Hare, et al. that dominated English-language meta-ethics in the middle of the twentieth century.  These philosophers rejected Moore's non-naturalist metaphysics and intuitionist epistemology as inconsistent with a naturalistic conception of the world.  They also rejected moral realism because they  thought Moore's OQA, or something similar to it, showed that realism was committed to defending those doctrines of Moore's that they found untenable (and perhaps incredible).  The route out of the metaphysical and epistemological problems relating to morality, they thought, was to be found in a distinctive account of the nature of moral language.  In particular, they argued that moral language is used to express our emotions and attitudes, or to prescribe certain actions for ourselves and others.  However, the noncognitivists ended up running into all sorts of problems in accounting for our ordinary beliefs about ways in which moral language can be used, the possibility of moral knowledge, the existence of correct answers to more questions, and the objectivity of morality.  In Miller's book, we see contemporary thinkers like Simon Blackburn and Allan Gibbard, who defend forms of noncognitivism, wrestling with these problems.<br />Still, their answers don't satisfy everyone, and some thinkers returned to a form of cognitivism:  that is, they began to defend the position that ethical language purports to describe a realm of moral facts.  And this brings us to the third part of our history of contemporary meta-ethics and of Miller's book:  the backlash against (at least the earlier, cruder forms of) noncognitivism.  All these cognitivists are concerned with finding a place for ethics within a naturalistic conception of the world.  The first such thinker Miller discusses is John Mackie, who defended cognitivism but argued that all our ordinary moral claims fail to be true since there are no objective moral facts to describe.  Others have a more sanguine view of possibilities for moral truth and knowledge, however, and they combine their cognitivism with a form of moral realism.  Some of these thinkers argue that moral claims can be reduced to claims that are part of the natural and social sciences; others argue that moral claims aren't reducible in this sense, but that this doesn't impugn their naturalness since moral claims, like claims in other areas, can be natural without being reducible to the subjects of the natural sciences.<br />There are a couple of things that need to be said about what this book is not.  First, despite its grounding in history, Miller's book isn't intended as a history of twentieth-century meta-ethical thought.  Only the first two chapters of the books seem to be accurately described as history, and the work of major figures like Hare, Stevenson, Prichard, Ross, et al., isn't brought into the discussion at all.  (For a brief discussion of historical matters concerning the relevant period, one might try Warnock's Contemporary Moral Philosophy.)  Second, while the book does often present Miller's own judgment on the argument he discusses, it isn't a work that presents and criticizes the views of others as part of a defense of the author's own take on the issues at hand.  (Introductions to meta-ethics of this variety can be acquired by reading works like Mackie's Ethics:  Inventing Right and Wrong, Harman's The Nature of Morality, and Smith's The Moral Problem.)<br />Rather than a history or an argument for a distinctive position, Miller's book takes the form of a philosophy textbook:  it is filled with brief discussions of several arguments for and against many of the positions that are defended by working meta-ethicists.  The book does have some notable virtues for a textbook that takes this format.  One such virtue is that the topics covered are well-chosen:  the book covers most of the positions that you'll need to wade through the literature on these issues, along with the most important arguments for and against those positions.  Another is that the coverage of some of these positions is quite broad for an introductory survey  (the chapters on Blackburn's quasi-realism, Cornell realism, reductivist forms of naturalism, and McDowell's views are each at least thirty pages).  Unlike many books of this sort, Miller's amounts to more than a laundry list of positions and arguments since many of the positions face similar problems and some thinkers appear as both proponents of certain views and critics of others.  In addition, the prose is clear throughout, and this clarity isn't achieved through dumbing down the arguments.  Finally, each chapter includes helpful suggestions for further reading in the relevant primary sources.<br />At the present time, this book is the one to pick up if you want a sense of the various positions being defended in meta-ethics.  So the book is a perfect supplement for courses surveying contemporary issues in meta-ethics that are aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduates.a history of twentieth-century meta-ethical thought.
