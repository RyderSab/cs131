But there's precious little \\"real world\\" here, unless you consider pathetic attempts at humor to be \\"real world.\\" You'd think that a book about a high-end illustration program that purported to be \\"real world\\" would at least have examples that a \\"real world\\" graphic artists might produce for a \\"real world\\" client, perhaps simplified somewhat to make a point. But instead, what you get are simplistic, off-the-cuff drawings that do a poorer job of explaining things than the simple examples in the Illustrator manual.<br />There's not much here that's not in the user's manual.

Much of the information here is available nowhere else -- and much of the rest of it can be found only by exhaustive searches through Microsoft archives. <br />In addition, some of the material -- the section on locking comes first to mind -- is explained better in this book than anywhere else I've seen (and I have a wide shelf of SQL Server books.<br />Perhaps the book can be criticized because it doesn't try to cover every last feature in the product. But it could not, at least not in the depth that Delaney digs into the topics she does address. And the topics she covers are at the core of getting good performance from SQL Server and are crucial for writing high-performance applications. There are many books on the market that cover the whole product superficially -- this isn't one of those books, thankfully. Perhaps in the next edition, less space could be devoted to the TSQL language (many other books cover this well) and used to broaden the coverage in other areas -- but that's a minor quibble.<br />If you are a SQL Server developer and are only going to buy one book on SQL Server, this should be it.	2001-11-28

This volume spends a lot of time on detailing the personal life of a very flawed man, and very little explaining why he was a seminal force in 18th century politics. I finally turned to his entry in the Encyclopedia Britannica, which in a short article did a better job of explaining Frederick's place in history than this book did.<br />Other flaws in this book: for those of us not familiar with 18th century European political geography, a map or two would have been helpful; without maps, it's impossible to understand Frederick's political machinations or (especially) his military campaigns. Also, incredibly, among the pictures there is not a single one of Frederick's queen!	2001-03-06

In this book, Lucien Stark analyzes the 25 duets (including the five  numbers of Opus 75, which were written for one or two voices but are almost  always done as solos) and 61 quartets that comprise this body of  work.<br />For each song, Stark provides the German text, along with an  English translation. He does not attempt to maintain the rhyme or meter in  the translation, which lets him reflect accurately the meaning of the  German. He then gives the range employed for each voice in the work, the  approximate timing for a performance, and the form. This information is  followed by a brief descriptive analysis of the work. Stark's analyses are  not so detailed or exhaustively researched as those by Eric Sams in his  just-published volume on Brahms's solo works.<br />The major deficiency of  this book is the absence of musical quotations. In his introduction, the  author admits that &quot;much of the analysis assumes that a score will be  accessible to the reader.&quot; Scores for many of these works are  available only as individual sheets -- and for a few, not in print at all  -- which makes it difficult to get full value from much of Stark's  otherwise commendable writing. A 158-page book that sells for $35 should  have been expanded with quotations of key musical material.	2000-07-19

Not included are any of the many Deutsche  Volkslieder set by Brahms.<br />For each song, the author provides the German  text and a prose English translation. The translations are especially well  done; by doing them in prose, the author is able to more faithfully render  the meaning of the German than would be the case were the translation to be  restricted by the requirements of English rhyme and meter.<br />Each  translation is followed by a non-technical discussion of the song,  generally in one or two paragraphs but occasionally longer. These describe  the musical structure of the song and the methods that Brahms used to  convey his meaning; occasionally there is also a brief bit of background on  the circumstances of the song's composition.<br />For each song, there then  follow a more technical notes section, in which the author identifies the  source of the text, identifies recurring motifs that Brahms used in his  songs (an introductory chapter describes these motifs), references other  settings of the same text by other composers, and sometimes describes early  reactions to the song by Brahms's friends or fellow musicians.<br />The  analyses illustrate the author's deep understanding of this marvelous  literature and have greatly enhanced both my knowledge and appreciation of  this superb body of work. The principal omission, and the reason I rate the  book only four stars, is the complete absence of musical quotations -  except for a few in the introductory &quot;Motifs&quot; chapter - in spite  of the fact that in his analyses, the author often refers to specific  measures by number. To fully appreciate the author's insights,therefore,  you will need access to scores. (Fortunately, Dover publishes a very  affordable four-volume set of the complete Brahms songs, available from  Amazon.)	2000-07-19

Those works covered by writers other than the editor get reasonably detailed treatment. Those written by the editor get very short shrift.  These are all solo lieder, vocal duets and quartets, and smaller-scale  choral works, especially the earlier works in these genres. Some of the  individual numbers in these sets get no more discussion than their names  and key signatures.<br />Even the longer essays are not by any means detailed  musical analyses. They are the equivalent of what you might expect from a  well-done set of notes included with a recording.<br />The title  &quot;Compleat&quot; is something of a misnomer. The book barely mentions  most of the WoO and posthumous works and discusses almost none of the many  alternate arrangements done by Brahms -- including some significant ones,  such as the transcriptions of Op. 120 for viola and piano.<br />Even with its  deficiencies, if you're a serious Brahmsian, this book will be a valuable  addition to your library.	2000-06-24

It is well-written and engaging from first to last. It gives a well-rounded picture of a complex and difficult subject -- difficult because the secretive Brahms systematically destroyed a great  deal of the evidence that biographers might otherwise have used to tell the  story of his life.<br />Swafford can perhaps be taken to task for his failure  to acknowledge the recent research that casts doubt upon Brahms' alleged  employment in brothels as a very young man. Swafford uncritically accepts  the account of Max Kalbeck, an early biographer who knew Brahms. Kalbeck's  source, so he said, was Brahms himself. Kalbeck cannot and should not be  taken at face value -- nor was Brahms himself incapable of embellishing a  good story. The recent research to which the previous reviewer refers casts  doubt Kalbeck's account, but to say &quot;that Brahms could not have played  the piano in brothels as a boy&quot; is overstating the case, going well  beyond the available evidence (as Avins does also in her book). We simply  do not know the truth, and probably never will.<br />The previous reviewer  also errs when he says that Swafford &quot;takes off from this picture of a  pitiful childhood as a central principle in Brahms's life, relationships,  etc.&quot; Swafford does not paint Brahms' childhood as  &quot;pitiful.&quot; He makes clear the love and affection that both of his  parents lavished on him and details the educational opportunities that they  provided him, in spite of the fact that they were working class people.  Brahms' affection for both his parents lasted until their deaths, as  Swafford makes clear. Swafford does use the supposed early brothel  experiences to explain (in part) Brahms' inability to form a lasting  romantic relationship, and in this analysis he may be relying upon events  that did not occur.<br />Swafford makes at least one minor error in his  musical analysis. In his discussion of the First Symphony's finale, he says  that the trombones make their initial entrance when they blare forth the  chorale theme (i.e., at measure 47). They actually enter earlier, as part  of the accompaniment to the first statement of the alphorn theme, at  measure 30.<br />These are nits that do not detract from a fine work. If you  have any interest at all in Brahms or in his music, you will enjoy this  book.	2000-06-01

The failure of the book is that it arrives at the  wrong answers.<br />There are two reasons that the book so fails. One is a  faulty thesis, and the other is the authors' failure to apply that thesis  rigorously to all five of the Presidents whose terms in office they  conclude cleared the &quot;greatness&quot; hurdle.<br />The authors' basic  thesis is that to be &quot;great,&quot; a President must effectuate  fundamental change in how Americans view their government. The problem is  that this standard excludes Chief Executives whose achievements were  critically important to the nation but that occurred within the existing  understanding of Constitutional relationships. Three candidates who are  thus excluded and for whom arguments could be made were the criteria  broader are Polk, Theodore Roosevelt, and Truman.<br />By the authors'  standards, a President who merely faces a nation-threatening international  crisis, makes the right choices on how to meet that crisis, implements  those choices by working cooperatively with a Congress controlled for half  of his term by the opposite party, and forges such a consensus around his  actions that it forms the bedrock of national policy for nearly half a  century, cannot be considered &quot;great.&quot; I refer, of course, to the  achievements of Truman, achievements that the authors dismiss as  &quot;inconceivable without Roosevelt.&quot; Well, of course Truman's  achievements were inconceivable without Roosevelt -- as Jefferson's were  without Washington, as Jackson's were without Jefferson, as Lincoln's were  without Jackson, and as FDR's were without Lincoln.<br />They go so far as to  call Truman's victory in 1948 &quot;FDR's greatest political triumph,&quot;  equating the election of1948 with those of 1808 and 1836, &quot;when  Jefferson and Jackson were the real victors&quot; -- ignoring the facts  that by November 1948 FDR had been dead for more that three years and that  the electorate had thus enjoyed ample time to evaluate Harry Truman.  The  authors give Truman little of the credit for sustaining Roosevelt's legacy,  though even they admit that after the election of 1946 many had concluded  &quot;that the New Deal could not survive the passing of FDR.&quot; They  grade down Truman's performance because he did not extend Roosevelt's  reforms -- when, in fact, he did, through the courageous and politically  perilous integration of the armed forces by executive fiat, an action that  certainly had an impact on the atmosphere in which the Civil Rights  struggles of the next two decades occurred.<br />If the thesis problem  excludes worthy candidates from the authors' pantheon, the inconsistent  application of that thesis lets at least one pretender slip in. That they  bestow the mantle of greatness on Washington, Lincoln, and FDR is  unsurprising, and essentially unassailable. They make a credible case for  Andrew Jackson. But they fail to convince when they argue that Jefferson  was a great President, even within the bounds of their thesis.<br />Their  argument in favor of Jefferson boils down to two achievements: he built the  (original) Republican party, thus establishing a basis for popular  government; and he expanded the size of the country via the Louisiana  Purchase. But, as the authors point out, much of Jefferson's party-building  took place not during his Presidency, but rather when he was in opposition,  in the 1790s; and they admit that Madison shares much of the credit for  party-building. The authors also admit that as President, &quot;Jefferson  could not bring himself to embrace the role of popular party leader.&quot;  They point out that Jefferson's support of the Embargo Acts was an utter  failure, that he &quot;retired from office with the Republic in  disarray,&quot; that he &quot;never repudiate[d] a view of the Constitution  that placed the cohesion of [the nation] continually at risk,&quot; and  that as a consequence of his ambiguous approach to Presidential leadership  &quot;the American regime nearly imploded.&quot; That hardly sounds like  the legacy of a &quot;great&quot; President!<br />  In their introduction,  they say that \\"a president bears a large share of responsibility for the  public's civic education. A democratic leader is one who takes the public  to school. By these criteria, the great presidents did indeed provide  meaningful democratic leadership ... They taught the citizenry about the need  for great change, but also about how to reconcile change with American  constitutional traditions and purpose. But the authors ignore their  standard of civic education when assessing Jefferson's alleged greatness.  They attribute to Jefferson an &quot;excessively restrained understanding  of the democratic leadership responsibilities of the president.&quot; They  say that &quot;He remained silent when he needed to speak&quot; and that  &quot;Jefferson did not educate the people about the meaning of the  transformation they were experiencing and about how they should come to  grips with it. In the face of the massive change he had instigated [i.e.,  the expansion of the country via the Louisiana Purchase], the author of the  greatest of democratic utterances stood mute.&quot;<br />It seems as though  the authors started with a view something like: &quot;Of course Thomas  Jefferson was a great President.&quot; They had the intellectual honesty to  present the substantial evidence to the contrary, but not the courage to  take that evidence to its logical conclusion.	2000-05-25

US	53093084	R374I90IP87FEB	0895263173	98073583	Betrayal : How the Clinton Administration Undermined American Security	Books	1	7	16	N	N	Phony &quot;journalism&quot; from a biased source	I bought this book because I have serious reservations and questions about the foreign policy and military practices of the Clinton administration. I hoped for a critical appraisal that would shed some light on those policies  and practices and where and how we've gone wrong. What this turns out to  be, however, is a lot of heat with precious little light. It's nothing more  than a polemic by a paid mouthpiece of the rabid right. There may be some  truth in here, but it's impossible to discern, mixed in as it is with one  probably imaginary &quot;anonymous source&quot; after another.<br />If you sop  up the Limbaugh / McCord / Buchanan line, you'll love this. If you want a  balanced assessment of the policies of the last six years, this ain't it.	1999-06-01
