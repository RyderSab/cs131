Lurking deep within the claustrophobic, meticulously alphabetic shelving of libraries the world over, are the answers to universal secrets. Divine gifts like Amazon.com, Borders, Barnes and Noble, not to mention the Mom and Pop labors of love just parked around the corner, provide us with the most startling wealths of knowledge, entertainment, or just sidenotes of fulfilling satisfaction. Most people go their whole lives reading the creative writings of others, yet never finding that one piece of literary art that changes their lives. Don't let this happen to you.<br /><br />Johnathon Ame's \\"Wake Up, Sir!\\" tells the story of a modern-day loser. Meet AlanBlair, a neurotic with a sexual affinity for noses; a Jewish germophobe writer who has only managed to put together one novel seven years before we meet him. Alan speaks at length, Cliff Klavin-style, about a myriad of topics, many of which he knows nothing about. A raging alcoholic, he begrudgingly lives with his aunt and uncle in Montclair, NJ because he was recently kicked out of his New York City apartment. He doesn't have a girlfriend, he doesn't have a job, he has no self-respect. Yes, Alan is a first-class idiot who thinks he is very smart. But the only smart thing he'd probably ever done in his entire life was use his hefty reward money from a timely lawsuit to procure the services of his detached, yet heavily useful valet, the preposterously named Jeeves.<br /><br />Alan and Jeeves decide on a hasty exit from Montclair right before his \\"guardians\\" decide to ship him off to rehab. Indecisive about where to go for a few chapters, Alan and Jeeves set up temporary shop at a Motel in Saratoga Springs. Breaking a promise made to his aunt about not drinking, Alan goes out to the local bar one night, gets wasted and ends up getting pummelled by a giant. Black and blue for the rest of the story, he gets accepted to a prestigious artists colony in upstate New York and off they go to begin their adventures with the eclectic personalities of the Rose Colony.<br /><br />Smartly written and witty, Ames manages to display just about every mistake, desire, fetish and thought celebrated and forgotten by us \\"normal\\" humans through his variety of characters at the colony. The heroic, yet flawed leader Mangrove, the quirky and ludicrously gorgeous Ava, the sexually depraved Tinkle, and the mammoth visionary Hibben, show us a tour-de-force in character creation and development. Backed by the drunken and hysterical stupidity of our main character, no expense was spared in the telling of many well-thought out stories about the frailty of the human condition. And Jeeves, amazing Jeeves, purposefully inspired from the English comic writings, \\"Thank You, Jeeves\\" and \\"Step Lively, Jeeves!\\", he is Johnny-on-the-spot at all times. With respect to Wodehouse, Ames really manages to make Jeeves his own creation.<br /><br />Calling this piece a life-changing experience might be a stretch, but this is what writing is all about. It's what reading is all about. It's fun, it's courageous, it's symbolic, it's got everything you need for a nice, funny, summer read - and beyond. This is the type of novel that isn't trying to change the world like the \\"Da Vinci Code.\\" Ames isn't out to exploit our weaknesses and tell us how wrong we are to have them, i.e., \\"Under The Volcano.\\"  What he did was create an appealing screw-up that you cannot help but root for, torture the guy until even a priest could identify with him, and wrap up the story with a slam-bang ending that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. That's pretty much what we all want. And if getting what you want doesn't change your life, how very preferred you must already be.ties of the Rose Colony.

He wrote his essays with a mock sarcasm and an intelligent enough wit that his being homosexual was always an afterthought. He puts his story first, above all else, and never seems like he's trying to be funny. When you do something well and make it look easy, that's talent. Now I know why so many readers love to compare Sedaris with all the other resident gay memoir writers. Because he's top tier. He's the best thing going.<br /><br />Several rungs down is Simon Doonan, author of \\"Nasty: My Family and Other Glamorous Varmints.\\" Doonan bills it as a sort of indictment of strange upbringing by even stranger guardians. Well, it's not about that at all. He lightly...so lightly touches on his insane grandmother, lobotomized uncle, devil-may-care alcoholic parents and various family friends that come into and out of his life. In truth, the subtitle to his novel takes the backseat in lieu of the real deal: numerous celebrations, anecdotes, misgivings and stories about being gay. Every single story is basically about gay Doonan who does this and that, as long as we understand that he's always playing for the \\"other team.\\" Really, it's like a funny, gay porno without the sex.<br /><br />Wait, did I say funny? Heck yeah, it's funny. A great deal of his more humorous tales just wouldn't fly without all the prissy overtones, so sometimes I understand where he's coming from. When he gets arrested for drunk driving, the best parts involve jokes about his hilarious drag outfit. And the gut-busting chapter where he compares his \\"nelly\\" self to his manly, tough-as-nails grandfather is pricelessly appropriate to his \\"theme.\\" Still and all, a good 60% of these pages don't have to be, \\"By the way, I'm a homosexual and I just happened to fracture my aunt's skull one day! And I'm gay, too!\\" You get the gist.<br /><br />Funny or not, I'm not a fan of his style of writing either. He will introduce new ideas and scenarios right in the middle of his story, and sometimes won't even return to the main point before the chapter ends. I kept feeling like his chapters should have been more compact, tighter. Let's see if I can make it clearer...<br /><br />Imagine reading a story about an ant. And because ants like breadcrumbs, you end up getting a story within a story about how bread is made. And then a man makes a sandwich. The end. And the end won't always be in English either. Let's not forget the constant phrases in French, a la \\"Lolita.\\" I always found this practice to be very pretentious. To all you writers out there, let's just write our books in one language okay? Just in case the whole country was kidding about being bilingual.<br /><br />Doonan, (did I mention that he's gay?) has no interest whatsoever in topping off his essays with any sort of satisfaction. You're laughing about a really funny situation he'd gotten himself into and then, nothing. Half the time, there is no great resolution, just a boring exit. It  just doesn't do justice to the scenario if you don't give it a nightcap with a kick. Seal the deal! Would \\"Vacation\\" had been funny at the end if Chevy Chase and his family finally made it to Wallyworld, had a great, problem-free time and just went home? No. If Doonan wrote all the endings, Keyser Soze would've kept limping, Babe would have lost the sheephearding contest and Darth Vader would never have had any kids.<br /><br />Actually, I wouldn't put that past Sedaris either. But he'd at least have made the ending funny.He will introduce new ideas and scenarios right in the middle of his story, and sometimes won't even return to the main point before the chapter ends.

This is a question that could send your mind into a tailspin of hazy, ponderous oblivion. A veritable ocean of deep discussion stemming from the wonder of existence...the secret of life. Ahhh, there's the rub. There is the uh, the thing there that...wait a minute, uh, what was I talking about?<br /><br />Hey, if it was good enough for the undisturbed Native Americans, it was good enough for George Washington. And if it was good enough for the boys in \\"Easy Rider,\\" it was good enough for Cheech and Chong. It was good enough for millions of Canadians and Amsterdam tourists. No matter who they were, they all agreed on one thing...<br /><br />It was good.<br /><br />Good enough to write a book about, Bob Flaherty gives us the story of two brothers who come up with such a jones for the wacky terbacky that they brave the harshness of murderously Arctic weather, sadistic cops who want to beat them senseless, a psychotic Hispanic, a retarded janitor and overbearing priests. One day, this will be a road movie, but for now it's just a fun little romp that, in the end, reinforces my insatiable hunger to stay as far away from Boston as possible.<br /><br />Set in the 1970's, \\"Puff\\" is told through the voice of John, the elder brother of a large family that waits nervously for the death of their ill mother, the only parent they have left. He and his younger brother want to calm their nerves with some toke smoke but their stash is bare. So, the mission, which they choose to accept, is to drive across town to their dealer's home, in the old beat up van they inherited from their deceased father, in the biggest blizzard to ever hit New England. Man...that must be some good stuff.<br /><br />During the execution of this rather thin storyline, the boys hit obstacle after obstacle, from a homicidal cat to an empty gas tank. It seems fate just does not want them to get high. In telling the story, Flaherty flashbacks to the boys' childhood, replete with touching stories about their relationship with their father, the crush John had on the little girl next door, etc. These are well-told backstories that come at you pretty often, but get old after awhile. Sometimes these tales just appear in order to set up whatever mess the boys will fall into next. This approach is effective, but overused and eventually predictable.<br /><br />Two things grabbed my attention above all else. One, the really moving feelings John and his family deal with between marijuana jaunts totally involve you as the characters mature before your very eyes. Second, Flaherty supplies you with the understanding that white people who live in Boston really, really hate black people. Racial epitaphs run so rampant throughout this novel, I was beginning to feel like Flaherty was trying to tell me something about himself. I hope not because I did like the book even though it should have been thirty pages shorter.  But, in the event that he is trying to get some strange point across - hey Bob! Let me give you the number of a guy I know in Southie. He'll mellow you out.<br /><br />(The characters for the film version pretty much screams Chris Evans and Seann William Scott)ies about their relationship with their father, the crush John had on the little girl next door, etc. These are well-told backstories that come at you pretty often, but get old after awhile.

Racial unrest is at an all-time high. Innocents suffer the blame of the guilty. So begins the newest piece by Walter Mosley - a searing cat-and-mouse chase built around the bastard children of War...<br /><br />Riots.<br /><br />Total fiction built around a true blight on history, \\"Little Scarlet\\" is about the mysterious murder of a black woman and the police won't do anything about it. When more women show up dead under similar circumstances, enter Easy Rawlins, part-time amatuer detective, full-time Sojourner Truth School janitor. Any reader familiar with Easy's past exploits will find a totally different man from his first entry, \\"Devil In A Blue Dress.\\" The former womanizer and unemployed binge drinker is pretty much settled down with his adopted daughter and son, making a family with his main squeeze Bonnie. His only vice is smoking and he's the head janitor at the school he works for. From time to time he plays detective in the form of \\"doing favors for people who repay him in favors.\\" Likeable cop Det. Suggs comes knocking and asks Easy to do a little investigating about the murders. With the police too worried about their own bad reputations in the enraged black neighborhoods, Easy is not only left with the task of solving a very intricate murder plot, but he also has to deal with the melting pot of Negro anger. Stores are up in flames, people are fighting in the streets and someone is committing murder after murder. With only a few close friends and a sort of \\"immunity letter\\" signed by the police to watch his back, off he goes into the hazardous, dark domain of 1960's Los Angeles.  Talk about the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><br />Mosley really kicks butt with this one. I have long criticized his penchant for throwing numerous characters at us at tornado speed, making them far too difficult to identify with or even remember at crucial points. This time out, Det. Suggs, the alluring Juanda, poor Geneva, et al., were easy to feel out and keep track of. It was a really pleasant change for a Mosley novel.<br /><br />Another nice twist was Easy's figuring out who the killer was in the middle of the book. Normally, we are shown a few generous red herrings and sparse truths that hold their ground until all is revealed in the last few pages of your average Rawlins mystery. Not even Sherlock Holmes would be able to figure out where he was going with these books until the \\"this is what happened and who is guilty of it\\" segment at the end.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love Mosley's writing, but it was nice to just watch Easy know who he was chasing for once. He really has grown as a character over the years, as have many of the supporting characters. His homicidal sidekick Mouse is forever the nutcase but I was a bit annoyed that we were offered no feasible explanation as to why he is alive, having been allegedly killed in \\"White Butterfly\\" and presumed dead all through \\"Bad Boy Brawly Brown.\\" Long-time stable Mofass has finally met his maker and Easy's son Jesus has quit school and become quite the self-made sailor. Lots of times it's a treat to read these mysteries just to see what all the characters have been doing between novels. Also, the inclusion of Paris Minton from the \\"Fearless Jones\\" books was very stylish as he chats with Easy while sitting outside his bookstore, ready to fend off any would-be vandals.

Somewhere in the back of his mind is a deeply disturbed and evil demon who longs for his home in hell and shows it with macabre, putrid displays, blood-curdling screams and heinous acts of violence, hoping that it's far-gone brethren will notice, come looking, and save it from a fate worse than death: being alone without anyone to shock.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like this guy's work, normally. But this thing just takes the cake. Not only is the premise of fledgling writers locking themselves away from humanity in an abandoned warehouse and calling it a creative \\"retreat\\" totally inplausible, but everything that they do later on is impossible to believe. Then, as if high-scale social deprivation wasn't enough, they up the stakes and starve themselves of other conveniences, from telephones...to fingers...to just plain being alive. YES, hungry, they even eat the dead. Why? Chuck tries to get us to buy the idea that when it is all said and done that fame and fortune will come their way due to the insane experiences they've undergone, but all I could see in the future's of the living was tears of sorrow as they limp to their friends' funerals, in the rain, getting wet because they don't have the fingers to hold up umbrellas for themselves.<br /><br />I won't pan this thing only because I really, really liked the short stories written by our stupid writers, which are interspersed with the main action throughout the novel. I recommend that you just go to the book store or library and spend a little time reading those because the rest is just designed to annoy, shock, nauseate, depress and tick you off with endless insults to our intelligence.<br /><br />Write good stories, Chuck. Don't try to outshock yourself, okay?	2005-05-04

She apparently was dead set on making good on this pledge because boy-oh-boy does the reader go to hell with main character Hannah, a seemingly somewhat attractive alcoholic who lives to destroy herself.<br /><br />Growing up in Asbury Park, NJ, I'd seen lots and lots of derelicts and drunks, homeless people and crackheads. Their lot in life seemed so far gone to me that it couldn't be very much unlike looking into total darkness; making a home in a wasteland where carbon monoxide took the place of oxygen. Well, compared to Hannah, it seemed like they had it easy.<br /><br />Literally bathing in the throes of human imperfection, Hannah is a puppet and Kennedy is the evil master pulling the strings. The poor girl spends her entire existence frequenting pub after pub after pub, blacks out all the time and never ceases to amaze in her efforts to destroy herself day in and day out. And the darnedest thing is, she manages to make it all sound like a hysterically good time. Witty, ironic and funny, puppet-master Kennedy has a ball killing narrator Hannah with the Devil's water: booze.<br /><br />I call Kennedy the puppet-master because it seems that she is the only reason Hannah does these things to herself. I found myself asking why, why, why over and over again. With every hallucination and after every binge, it becomes less and less clear what her motivations are. It all seems contingent upon the whims of the writer - the malicious demon dead-set on taking us on a rollercoaster ride through her firey neighborhood at the expense of this hapless figment of her imagination.<br /><br />Somehow through all these terrible experiences, Hannah meets the man of her dreams, though she doesn't know it. This is Robert, a hard drinking mix between Cary Grant and Dean Martin with all their skeletons thrown in as a package deal. He doesn't want to change her, just love her and be loved by her. That's cool and all but he sometimes seems to cramp her style because she'd much rather be wasted than be in love, already having chosen a threesome with Jim Beam and Captain Morgan. She loves being with him, undoutedly, but there's just something lacking about their love affair and I applaud the puppet-master for making that so eloquently subtle.<br /><br />There's not a lot of story here, but what there is is beautifully written and well-told without overdoing it. She drinks, she rehabs, she drinks, she gets a boyfriend, she drinks, she rehabs, end of story...and not with the happiest of endings either. I'll tell you, if it weren't so funny from time to time, this is one book that might drive you to drink. Now and then, it's as sunless as \\"Under The Volcano\\" but more amusing than \\"Dry.\\" If this floats your boat, go out and rent \\"Leaving Las Vegas,\\" \\"Days Of Wine And Roses,\\" or \\"The Lost Weekend.\\" All tough ones to watch.in as a package deal.

Truly, I expected a new Sedaris memoir, but what I found was a book full of short stories from people he'd either admired or stories he liked quite a bit. So, he got these abstract pieces together and got them grouped into one book, edited said book and wrote a forward. Under no circumstances should you think that this was a Sedaris work. It just shows how much he loves short stories and aside from the skill in writing the stories within this book, there is nothing else of merit to speak of.<br /><br />\\"Gryphon\\" is my favorite, which is about a teacher trying to get her students to think outside themselves in her own seemingly clandestine way. It was made into a movie by Max Mabru Films for PBS Wonderworks and is easy to find on video via the writer's website. My only problem with the story is that you never really find out why it has the title it has.<br /><br />No matter if the writers are alive or dead, Sedaris picks some solid small literature for his labor of love, complete with the often reveered \\"Bullet in the Brain\\" by Tobias Wolff. Some readers would say that Sedaris was a little off or wrong in including some writers and excluding others, as he admits that some of his favorites did not make it in the book. But, keep in mind who's personal movement this was...Sedaris'. Not yours and not mine, so take it for what it is and enjoy what he has done. But, basically, as a book, all this does is keep you from having to buy the pieces individually, if you have not read them yet.<br /><br />But they might even garner new fans, making them have to go out and buy their individual preferences anyway.	2005-04-26

It's during this time when freeloading pot-head Zonker gets kicked out of Mike and JJ's place, Duke gets mind-blasted off 24hours breathing ether and Rick Redfern binges on scotch with his buddy Duane because...Reagan wins another four years in office. Classic Doonesbury stuff here. Seldom does Trudeau throw curveballs. Sometime he will kill a character, other times a character might lose a leg in the war. But this time out, it's standard comic fare.<br /><br />The best parts are the debut of homesless woman Alice as child neglecter/reporter Rick goes out to live in the streets, researching a piece he's writing - and a side-story about the \\"We Are The World\\" artists getting together to sing a little song about hope. Funny thing here is, I can't figure out whether Trudeau is mocking the project or just using it to poke fun at other things political. Good Doonesbury character history piece here as Mike Doonesbury becomes the \\"Subway Hero\\" completely by accident. Fun story.	2005-04-04

Just recently have I become a fan and just recently have I picked up almost all the books in order to keep myself up to date.<br /><br />The political satire involving several major characters over so many years IN REAL TIME is really something to tip your hat to.<br /><br />This book in particular deals with Arnold's reign of governatorship  and the farciful laughs behind his groping of women beforehand, hence his Doonesbury Name \\"Herr Gropenfuhrer.\\" He is shown as a large groping hand instead of the muscle-bound oldie-but-goodie we all know and love him to be.<br /><br />More than anything else, this piece chronicles mainstay B.D.'s final days in Iraq as a militaryman. His last helmet is taken off by EMT's who nurse him after a shell-blast has taken off his leg. Stirring stuff and easily my favorite Doonesbury saga.	2005-04-02

(A Doonesbury book)	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Pretty good but no big deal	I liked the stories, but there is only one that stands out in my mind. It's about Joanie going to law school and rooming with a black female law student. It is pretty evident that neither of them knows a damn thing about the other's race, nor cares, but they seem to get along. The funniest part about this whole saga is the black chick's boyfriend who is right out of Sanford and Son, starring Ralo! He is a nice enough guy but is dumb as all get-out and even his girl is getting tired of him. He is always hanging around the apartment driving Joanie crazy, not to mention his girlfriend, who's name escape me.<br /><br />there is more to talk about with a white kid and a black kid who form a great relationship despite the white kid's mother teaching him horrible stories about the evils of black people. in the end, the white kid tells his mother that he will have whatever friends he wants and that her views pretty much suck.<br /><br />these are not the only the stories in the book but they are the only ones that matter.	2005-04-02

He was nothing more than a giant cigarette with an otherwise amiable face. He started out as a figment of Mike Doonesbury's imagination during his bout with smoking. This being turned into something much bigger as his friends Ms. N, a pack of nicotine gum - Mr. Jay, a weed smoke and Baby Tar, another smoke, came into being. I might add that Baby Tar is one of the worst rappers in the history of music.<br /><br />To be honest, other things starring major Doonesbury characters happen in this piece, but the smoking stuff is all that really matters. And it's all the best.<br /><br />Oh yeah, Duke gets wasted on booze and controlled substances while Honey stands by oblivious.	2005-04-02

That's why it gets three stars. Right down the middle.<br /><br />It's a breeze to read. His ideas about sports and steroids are pretty mystifying. He is so pro-juice, it's not even funny. His ideas about growth hormones and roids are very compelling as he considers them the wave of the future - almost the saviors of humanity in general, making the next generation a superior species, even adding twenty or so years to our lives. This said, his high-powered stories about Mark Maguire, Jason Giambi and, to a lesser extent, Barry Bonds, are not so much finger-pointings or accusations, just outings. He makes Giambi look like he didn't even know what he was doing during his drug-taking days, an amateur army Private playing with a machine gun. Really, Canseco's knowledge about these performance enhancing drugs seems so limitless that you almost start to believe in his argument. Almost.<br /><br />In truth, the piece reads like a higher grade of your average \\"pro-wrestler of the month\\" memoir, just with more sex stories thrown in. He goes into great detail about his hundreds of liasons with wantonly-labelled, fast women. \\"Road Beef,\\" for example, is a piece of action you pick up when traveling between cities. He shakes hands with Roger Clemens in a sporting fashion, praising him for being one of the few players he's known well in the past who NEVER considered cheating on his wife, but had no problem getting the \\"Hall of Fame\\" calls from officials by making sure they all got to play on the best golf courses. His stories about the umpires are must-reads!<br /><br />Still, all too often does he gloss over a particularly interesting subject because it is seemingly too tough for him emotionally (his dad, marriages) or because he'd rather avoid a lawsuit (Alomar's spitting on the ump, Ripkin's not-so-brotherly treatment of him). I especially liked how he documented the beginnings of his career. He all but admits to sucking at the sport until he started getting juiced in his twenties.<br /><br />Canseco's freshman effort only lags on some occasions, most notably his family life.

She's rich, hubba hubba. She's self-absorbed, yuck. She's a writer? Nope.<br /><br />In an effort to totally go against what the highest-rated reviewers on this site always do - write four and five-star reviews about everything they read and therefore, get glowing helpful votes - I went out and got a book that I knew deserved one star. Just so I could BASH IT!<br /><br />It didn't work out that way. It's not a lousy piece though, it's just no a good one. If you've ever seen her \\"tv series,\\" you know that Paris Hilton has a certain type of charm in her speech and personality. It's fun to laugh at her stupidity and cringe at her lack of respect for people less affluent than she. But she is charming and a great deal of how she writes is how she speaks. The book is as charming as she is and that's why people fall for everything she does.<br /><br />it's just what you'd expect from someone like her so don't get mad when you read it and find it to be fluff, bland, put-upon, air-headed and silly. you should have known that when you bought it. with that in mind, there is no way i can pan this book. it sucks. but i expected a heck of a lot worse. because i got more than what i expected, two stars.	2004-09-10

She attacks tongue in cheek and keeps the autillery (so to speak) going at a quick pace, questioning the motives and ideals of both Bush fellas and sometimes joking on them in such a way that I could just hear Michael Moore saying, \\"D'oh! Why didn't I think of that!?!\\"<br /><br />To wit, it's fun to ask the whys and withertos concerning a war that pretty much helps no one directly and it's preposterous to remind ourselves of a leader who one day calls himself the \\"War President\\" and the next day calls himself the \\"Peace President.\\" And any question of why a man who never had to work a day in his life, getting over on reality time and time again, leaning on daddy for comfort and security, is the leader of the disabled, the working man, the white collar surgeon, the retired fisherman in Florida, is a complete waste of time, bordering on rhetoric.<br /><br />Miss Dowd knew this and she made her point known through the written word. For all the good it will do.<br /><br />Good book. Too cutesy at times. Some columns were a little long, others a little short. But I've seen worse political papers.	2004-08-30

With \\"Lullaby,\\" he manages to create a pressence, a feeling of unease with amoral characters doing things that pass as normal in a very strange world.<br /><br />This world in particular would have us deal with Carl, a journalist who finds out that recent maladies of crib death are due to parents reading a culling song, a death spell to their children, thinking it an actual lullaby. Inexplicably, Carl's wife and child died 20 years hence under similar circumstances, so this is a phenomenon that penetrates deeply into his already troubled brain.<br /><br />During his investigation he meets a few ragtag weirdos, including Helen, a tacky and underhanded real estate agent, Mona, a young witch, and her boyfriend Oyster, a grungy wiccan PETA wannabe. Somewhere along the line fate puts them all together, sending them on a quest to find and destroy \\"Poems and Rhymes From Around The World,\\" the book containing the culling song. Keeping this in mind, rest assured that Chuck P. makes certain that this road trip is anything but predictable.<br /><br />Like many of his characters, the people in this book do all kinds of things that the average human being would cringe at. Random killings, witchcraft, necrophilia, malice, absolute grossness! Much of the time, Chuck P.'s descriptions are enough to make the stomach turn and retch. But, it doesn't hamper the quality of the piece. It's a good book from start to finish with one or two endearing characters to root for, the best of which is Helen Hoover Boyle.<br /><br />The things I cared less about in this novel were the repetitive catches that were nice for a hundred pages, but get tiresome after awhile. \\"This is my life\\" is one. \\"It's brown, but not brown like a chocolate bar but brown like auburn after a woman's black hair dye is beginning to fade.\\" We get that sort of thing with just about every color going. Then there were the constant newspaper ads and the silly side-story about the haunted houses that totally didn't need to be in there and was given no acceptable explanation whatsoever. Soon these cliche's get annoying and I found myself skipping forward when I caught one starting.<br /><br />None of that stuff is enough to ruin the book though. There are enough turns to keep one interested but it didn't grab me enough to give it the highest rating possible like many very generous reviewers. I feel like 5 stars should be alotted to legendary literature and instant classics. This doesn't qualify.es that totally didn't need to be in there and was given no acceptable explanation whatsoever.

If you're a Yankee fan, you know about most of the stuff written within, it's just a matter of believing, liking and passing it off as pure drivel. I fell in with the 50/50 crowd.<br /><br />Back in the 70's the Yankees weren't the same team we know them to be today. As of 2004, they are gentlemen, winners, white collar players who are used to winning and will stop at nothing to keep their lives normal. 25 years ago, they were out of control, players ran the clubhouse and free agents thought they were God's gift to the team. Not very flattering. They've come a long way baby...<br /><br />A long time Yankee fan, I jumped on this book in my free time and a great deal of it is nicely put together. Not for everyone though, especially Red Sox fans. On the other hand, it's not for Steinbrenner fans either because it tells the truth. The whole truth. And nothing but the truth, indicting several harsh realities and wrongdoings within the league. I liked a bit of that, though I'm not much of a gossip.<br /><br />The big payoff is the spiel about the dynasty's reign during the late 90's and early 2000's. Read it for history. Read it for rumors. Read it for glory.	2004-08-26

While most of what he goes out to tell us is vastly informative, if you're well aquionted with working out and eating right, a lot of it is a rehash of everything you already know but are too lazy to apply. That was my problem with the book. He told me very little of anything new. But...<br /><br />What he did teach me about was hugely valuable. Not being perfect, I didn't know everything about the values he was teaching and things like various ab exercises and how to prevent different diseases with fitness were new to me. Either way, I just took my before pictures with my fiance' and we're off and running with the diet as of today. Looking forward to the progresses and results.<br /><br />All in all, there were a few things that worked for me and many that I already knew about like workouts, the good things about 6 meals a deal, fat, salt, sugar, etc. The encouraging words of those who had finished the diet and came out strong are excellent. If I end up losing 20 pounds or more, I will come back and give the book an extra two stars on general purpose.<br /><br />OCT. 20TH 2004 and I lost 15 pounds but people i know say i look better and more toned. i might have lost more but i cut myself cooking and couldnt use my hand for the weight workout. give it a shot because i will continue on!	2004-08-23

You don't have to be a nutcase to be a sex addict, but he pulls it all off pretty well. He's a player in a Civil War reenactment troup and a med school drop out.

Barrell Fever starts off as an obvious first time-type  effort from Sedaris, his other later works showing themselves to be glaringly superior. More superior in scope, ideas, ability and humor. Many of the stories within this book aren't what later Sedaris readers are used to. Lots of them are told from the points of view of imaginary people in far-fetched circumstances. Only a few of the writings are presented as life experiences from Sedaris himself and I didn't know that when I bought the book. I'm more of a memoir reader and that's what I was expecting. Many of the stories are pretty trite and simple, often annoyingly so.<br /><br />One of the better made-up stories is a great piece called, \\"Seasons Greetings\\" about a family that is shaken up when a long-lost Korean daughter of the army veteran father shows up on the family doorstep. It has its moments of racism, but I found it really funny.<br /><br />However, by far, the story \\"Santaland Diaries,\\" Sedaris' real-life exploits as Macys elf during Christmas-time, is priceless! It could be the funniest thing he's ever written. If you feel like checking out the writer's beginnings, this book is a good start.	2004-08-18

Have you ever just picked up a book because people hyped it up so much that you just had to see for yourself? Sure you have because you're reading this review. You've either read it for the hype or you're planning on buying it. Because of the hype. Well, I'm here to tell you, in the immortal words of &quot;Public Enemy,&quot; an 80's rap group that Eggers would no doubt find a reason to ridicule because of the color of their skin...<br /><br /> &quot;Don't believe the hype.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;A Heartbreaking Work&quot; is a memoir about a family of siblings that is rocked by the deaths of their parents only months (or weeks?) apart. As a result, they go off to live new lives, trying to start anew, &quot;Party of Five&quot; style. One point of view of this experience and all other and subsequent experiences is shown to us through the words of one sibling, the writer Dave Eggers.<br /><br /> Eggers fills his novel with endless ramblings and overly detailed narratives that expose his neurotic, arrogant personality with far more depth than the actual story or it's characters. In fact, I only liked one character in the story, his younger brother Topher, whom Eggers takes upon himself to raise with grandiose obsessiveness. The visualizations of his complete and utter love for the boy are wonderful feelings depicted on paper. Their relationship is a high-point of the story, is pretty much the story, and is better than the story. Said story is sometimes funny, but mostly not. It's not the least bit informative and his &quot;witty&quot; drawing of a stapler left me no more impressed than when I saw the drawing of an anus in &quot;Breakfast Of Champions.&quot; A rehashed, unfunny ploy. There is a thirty page interview between him and a &quot;Real World&quot; exec, wherein he tries to get on the show. It's painful, to say the least. This is bad, bad, writing in which time the interviewer is left one small question per his long-winded paragraphs of a response.

Ric Flair has always been a god in professional wrestling. and to watch him work is to love his style. I think back on the years of watching wwf and nwa, then wcw and fits of nostagia start to make themselves known. the crazy storylines! remember the angle about the black scorpion? how about the incompetence of jack tunney? the four horsemen jumping dusty rhodes in the parking lot, mr. perfect's perfect sports episodes. it's all here, from ric's beginnings to his heyday. i enjoyed the book but it's just no better than any of the others, aside from flair's more interesting history than, say, mankind's, this might have even been writtin by the same author. if you're not a wrestling fan, there literally would be no point in you buying this.<br /><br />  but clearly the best parts are his opinions on various wrestlers, good or bad, i always wondered about that plane crash that broke his back and now i have the whole story right from his mouth, so to speak. come to think of it, it might be slightly better than the other books. but that's because flair has so many great stories to tell about a great life. but some of his tales have harrowing effects. there is one bit about him being saddled with traveling with two highly racist redneck rasslers in the south. quite ugly.<br /><br />  as an omen, while i write this on a sunny july sunday in new jersey, what movie just happens to be starting on fox 5? body slam, with roddy piper and lou albano. i will throw in another star, just for fate's sake.<br /><br />i'm sorry to read some of the reviews for this book. i never was a fan of the concept of using amazon review boards to fight petty squabbles. that's for silly children.	2004-07-25
US	36145828	RS3UQ9JWTSG9B	1400032717	459979615	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Books	3	2	6	N	Y	A Nice Little Novel	Don't be fooled, this piece is by no means a 4 star winner. Just another case of stars wantonly being thrown around all over the place, which I have been noticing quite often with higher ranked reviewers. What a curious incident....<br />Actually, the book is pretty entertaining, well-written, has an amicable character who somewhat horribly tends to get on the old nerves from time to time. Every now and then, his talking style is tough to take and I eventually found myself able to finish many of his sentences without reading them because I was used to his repetition. This person would be Christopher, the protagonist, an autistic kid who rides the &quot;special&quot; bus to school. He's fifteen, but seems ten, and we are reading his book. He began writing it after finding a dog stuck with a pitchfork and decided to find the killer.<br />I found the approach here very interesting. It starts out as an actual whodunnit and it becomes weird that the author would pick a &quot;special&quot; kid as his Sherlock Holmes. After awhile it becomes more and more evident that its not the author Haddon's book, but Christopher's and it cannot be taken at face value as an all out detective story. It can't be. Because it's just a kid telling us about his mini adventure through the neighborhood. I was almost fooled.<br />This becomes more and more evident as the book goes on. The detective plot takes a different turn and becomes a road story as Christopher is faced with a new obstable concerning the death of his mother years ago. This turns out to involve his father, who loves him dearly, Mrs. Shears across the street, the old lady down the way and his beloved teacher at &quot;special school.&quot; The dog takes the backseat and a human story about love, loss, bravery and trust takes form through the eyes of a mentally troubled kid who seems to be the love child of Forrest Gump and Rain Man.<br />The things I liked most about the piece were the occasional digressions about math(s) which Christopher is a whiz at, of course. His little drawings and ideas about life that he deduced through math(s) problems are often wildly fascinating. I enjoyed this book, but it's simplicity and sometimes annoying main character and his words tried my patience.ich Christopher is a whiz at, of course.

He is brash, he is amusing, he is self-centered (not so much this time out), he is very unorthodox. Nothing he writes will set the world on fire, but he's clearly not trying to do that. All he is trying to do is have a good time, his way, the only way he really seems to know how.<br />Sedaris strikes me as one of those reclusive writers, the ones who really don't want to be around too many people who know their faces, but have no problem expressing themselves through the written word, speaking to us, baring his soul, without ever having to look into our eyes. He strikes me as that kind of character, really. Just look at his photo on back. A picture of someone who is totally uncomfortable posing for the camera, insisting on a natural action shot. Never speaking to us directly.<br />Sure, sure, he has his public radio work, he does his appearances, fine. But those are contributions rather than fame. Sedaris doesn't seem to adhere to the social understanding that he has \\"made it.\\" and he doesn't care. he just wants someone to talk to. without actually talking to anyone.<br />great scam he has though, i admit. little essays about this and that. nothing major, nothing really minor. just having a conversation. telling a story to an audience held captive by their own devices. what a fine read this book is! my favorite stories involve his times in paris trying to understand the language, a little piece about taking responsibility for a turd in a friends toilet and a rather long dissertation concerning a family dog. one story really bothered me. it was about his riding a train in france with his partner and a married american couple are badmouthing him to each other, thinking him french and not able to understand their words. he lets it all fall off his back with no redemption. I WOULD HAVE LET THEM HAVE IT! and it bothered me that he would let himself get so beaten up by these ignorant steers!<br />but there it is. he had successfully drawn me into his story to the point where i not only identified with the character, but i sympathized. and that's all i ask. but when he moves me to higher levels, goes above and beyond the call of duty, showing me ingenius creativity and flare that just knocks me for a loop...he'll get 4 stars.ignorant steers!<br />but there it is. he had successfully drawn me into his story to the point where i not only identified with the character, but i sympathized. and that's all i ask. but when he moves me to higher levels, goes above and beyond the call of duty, showing me ingenius creativity and flare that just knocks me for a loop...he'll get 4 stars.	2004-07-12

Hate our neighbors because they exist. Kill strangers without conscience. Why? Because we're barbaric? Are we naturally predisposed to evil deeds in order to keep the population boom in hand? Why in the world should I ever have to come across a story that chronicles the unknown hatred of one civilization to another? I should not have had to read this book because the reason for it written should never have happened.<br />Black slavery is the second-most despicable atrocity the United States has ever known. I say second-most because at least most lives of black people were spared so that this country could be built on the strength of their backs. No, the worst thing to happen to America was the inhuman treatment and near total destruction of the Native Americans.<br />Everybody knows the story.<br />No act of horror is more documented than the Jews being decimated at the hands of Nazi cavemen. Misguided into thinking that they were elite. Bombings, horrible experiments, endless gunfire, starvation, gas chambers, ovens made for cooking...people. A blight on the face of a planet replete with a history of destruction and malicious intent.<br />Maybe you've heard of it.<br />But \\"Black Dog Of Fate\\" tells another version of terror and hate. It's a story you've heard a thousand times but from the mouth of a different victim. Another voice. It very vividly tells us about the Armenian genocide, allegedly at the hands of the Turkish government. What begins as a memoir about young Balakian growing up in an Armenian family, yet doing his darnedest to stay waist-deep in the pool of Americana, becomes a quest of an adult Peter searching for his roots. The lives and deaths of his people.<br />To this day the Turks deny that they almost wiped out an entire civilization and I'm no one to argue here nor there. But the evidence, the painful words from those who were there, that escaped - it's like a whirlwind of torment to the ears and eyes of those who will listen and learn. But nobody knows anything about this stain on humanity because very few victims lived to tell about it and literally none of the suspects will atone for their crimes.<br />This is one of many novels that will endear and enlighten. My only real gripes are that it becomes a tad preachy (though it hardly cannot be) and it's two stories, two tones in the same book. It starts out a little happy-go-lucky. Somewhat light-hearted and sometimes funny for the first half. Then, things take a 180 and it's all out depressing. The entire second half of the book is killing and shooting and stealing and just plain bleak. Sometimes life has to be that way but as a reader it was a bit overwhelming.<br />And it's supposed to be. Lucky me. I just read it. Too many people lived it. You read it too. And talk about it.

I don't even know what made me read it. I think I just found it in my mother's house amid throwaways in the attic. Oh no...this is NOT to be thrown away, this treasure of English literature. This is the reason why we read.<br />Pip is an orphan with no prospects in sight. But one day, under the strangest of circumstances, he becomes the veritable ward of an unknown benefactor and hurtles toward the gentlemanly future of high living and culture. Along the way, he is placed in the almost daily charge of the bitter and rich shut-in Miss Havisham, guardian of the irresistable, yet bitchy Estella. Poor Pip spends a great deal of his days partaking in the education of a gentleman, doing the bidding of the witchy Havisham woman and pining after the girl who uses and abuses him. It sometimes seems like this high society training is a big freakin' mistake.<br />Things heat up when he comes across the criminal Magwitch and doesn't turn him in to the authorities. From there on in the piece continues to fill the mind with limitless imagery. The writing style is a beaut and the characters continue to intrigue with every passing page, from the disgustingly prunish Miss Havisham to Pip's dim-witted, but thoroughly likeable father - a man he sadly comes to see as shameful as his education and training strengthens. <br />This is a story of yearning and loss, guilt and foolish pride as one person after another gets a wish granted and regrets it or waits for a train that never comes in. Yet somehow the ending leaves behind a great feeling. This is among my favorite books ever.	2004-07-02

I think back to my years at Asbury Park High School and how there was little to no educated reading of books by or of black people, which I think is strange now as Asbury Park was a mostly black town. It wasn't until I eventually got to a black university that I learned more and more of my heritage, black history and what could become a black future.<br />Oh, as good as they were, I read \\"The Crucible,\\" \\"The Pearl,\\" \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" etc. in Asbury Park, but not until Norfolk State U. did I even know \\"Kaffir Boy\\" existed. And what a travesty! I know all about white history and such. Someone asked me the other day how I even heard of a group called \\"Frankie Goes To Hollywood.\\" Because when I was growing up in the 80's, everything on MTV was white. I had never met a Chinese person except the goof in high school who got voted \\"Class Clown.\\" My favorite television show was \\"Tales of the Gold Monkey,\\" a show with no black characters. A great deal of black life, especially literature, is lost on today's youth because it was lost on yesterday's youth.<br />Why were we spared the turmoil of Mark Mathabane's childhood? His oppression by evil soldiers who shared the darkness of his skin tone, as they forced him to practically dance in feces? His needs, yearns for a better life studying tennis at the tutledge of a kindly white sponsor? His fright at unexpected and often raids on his poor village by storm troopers ripe with power and arrogance yet bereft of dignity and compassion? Why didn't anyone tell me of this book when I was 15? Because if we're aware of the evils of the world when we are young, there will be unlimited resources for us to change it in the future.	2004-06-15

But if you would like to be enlightened by a sincere and elemental world of wonder, interest and order, then stay in that line of folks waiting for Dan Brown to autograph your copy of the \\"Code.\\" You know that line I'm talking about...that LONG line. Lucky for me that I'm the type of person who uses both legs to stand in TWO lines.<br />That is to say, Sedaris is SO not for everyone. His books waste time. They lend no real insight toward bettering the mind or the world. All they do is depict what the world is like for a gay obsessive compulsive with too much of himself on his mind and, as I have mentioned before about today's white writers, a loving penchant for parading the n-word around like it's shakespeare prose. I've read two of his books and he hasn't failed with it yet. I plan on getting more of the same when I read more of what he has written.<br />Because I will read more of his work. He tells a fine story about mundane things that never make you lose interest. One of my favorite pieces in \\"Dress Your Family...\\" is more or less about worms that didn't make it to space in the \\"Challenger\\" shuttle. There is also a funny story about the existence of Santa Claus in a remote country as he prances around towns giving presents to people with his six to eight black friends.<br />My personal fortress of solitude is the bathroom. That is pretty much the one place, or should be the one place, anyone gets any real, personal time alone. I cherish the very existence of the bathroom, so saying that I kept Sedaris' novel in there for me to read during visits is by no means a stain, so to speak, on his work. It could actually be considered flattering. Some of it is toilet humor anyway.e to read during visits is by no means a stain, so to speak, on his work. It could actually be considered flattering.

It really is a fine feeling when you get totally absorbed into a great story about something purely fictional and fantastic - utterly and completely the product of someone's imagination. And fiction being my choice of reading, my primary fix for written entertainment, it's a nice bit of fate to have picked up a particularly dense piece and not be reminded of how lengthly it actually is with every turn of the page. &quot;Forever&quot; starts off with a mellow hue, mudane visions of everyday life shown to us through atmosphere and character. Once the foundation is laid, it speeds up with the main course of the story. Time passes and choices are made and pages breeze by without hints of predictability or foolishness. Except for the ending. Alas, nobody's perfect.<br />&quot;Forever&quot; is the tale of a young Irish guy in the late 1700's and the brutal destiny that awaits him after the murder of his family, more or less at the hands of the Earl Of Warren. The young man is introduced more fully to his heritage when it becomes known to him that it is his duty to hunt down the Earl to the ends of the earth and avenge his loved ones through the Earl's demise and also the subsequent killings of his every male spawn. That mission takes him to New York City where he befriends an African slave who possesses a very rare gift of immortality. After a skirmish gone bad, the young man finds himself on his &quot;deathbed&quot; and also very grateful to have met the African, who grants him the glory of an endless life as long as he never, ever leaves the island of Manhattan. If he does, it's suicide and he will never be granted peace in death. Ironically, he spends all that time in NYC hunting down the seeds of the Earl of Warren.<br />Hundreds of years pass and as one sinful Warren after another is terminated, we are given a wonderous depiction of New York evolving from woodland settlement to plague-ridden cobblestone to today's mass of sky-eating concrete, glass, plastic and steel. There are points within the piece where you actually get the feeling that the author has some kind of time machine and has seen these amazing changes for himself. The characters are great, some made up, some real. And it was particularly nice to see the friendships between the Africans and the Irish before evil predujices drove rifts between them, creating the famous hate that raged on in later years.<br />This really is a great book.

IT GETS FUNNY! man this writer finds his niche so well during the middle of the book that i just could not put the darn thing down! yeah, he bored the stuffing out of me for so long, i was sure that i was just going to leave the stupid book on the train like i did that piece of junk, &quot;dirt music.&quot; but man oh man am i glad i didnt. no, this isn't &quot;the davinci code&quot; or anything like that, but it is a nice little read that gave me a bit of pleasure. thankfully, it winds up nice and easy and in much of a way that i expected, which pleased me because it kind of couldn't end any other way. check it out.of couldn't end any other way. check it out.	2004-01-12
