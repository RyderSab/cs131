She falls in love with Jamie, the tour electrician, but Jamie is hung up on Lacey Leigh. <br />This is an intriguing romance because Jamie and Kip are genuinely likeable people and the reader will root for them as they make their cross-country musical journey. But there's so much more to the story than that. There's Wes, the exasperated tour manager, Eric, the cool-headed boss, Buck and Drew, the band mates that inspire Kip's career, Emma, Jamie's lifelong friend, and Mary, Kip's giddy friend back home in Minneapolis. Each of these characters round out the story and give it dimension.	2003-08-02
US	40530976	R2MQYKUD7LWJPK	187806794X	398316713	Working Parts: A Novel	Books	4	6	6	N	N	a highly enjoyable read	Lori is a likeable protagonist who uses sarcasm, charm and wit to try to woo people over and distract them from the fact that she can't read. When her friend Mickey, who works with her in a bike shop, wants to open his own shop with her, she decides it's time to learn to read. Along the way, she meets Pam, a sexy librarian, Deidre Felix, the 60-something tutor who's getting a divorce, and Whitney, the professional lesbian whom Lori starts a relationship with. Though the novel drags its feet a little bit in the middle, overall it's an enjoyable, insightful read that explores relationships, friendships and class issues. It's also an interesting concept for a writer to write a novel about someone who has trouble reading.	2003-04-13

But since the whole book is really just two dogs in different poses, don't purchase it unless you're a true dachshund lover. I bought this book as a gift for my relatives who own dachs, and they oohed and ahhed over it.	2003-04-13

Thumbelina has a silly name and long blonde hair. Her less-than-perfect mother dies unexpectedly, and after she goes to a foster home, she teams up with another sassy youngster, a girl named Myrna who has orange curls. Together, they try to make it out in the world. This is a sad novel that draws you in until the last page. Though the lack of quotation marks and the slow plot development make the novel a little clunky at times, Thumbelina and Myrna are such fascinating characters that it doesn't matter.	2003-04-05

This is a quiet, unassuming collection of short stories about women who do unusual and strange things. The things these women frequently do--such as chase after buses and disperse advice by shouting from a giant, red chair--are abstract and metaphorical, but always real. Even women who have tangible problems such as wanting to lose ten pounds take unusual measures. And Brownrigg makes it all work with her rich, playful language.	2003-02-18

I enjoyed the story of Djuna, Brynn and Vera, and I appreciated the fact that all three sides of the story were told. It's especially useful to present the poetry and novel of a character who can't speak for herself; this is very clever. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the novel-within-the-novel, which was called Splinters. The second half of the book is really where it all comes together, and it was only then that I really came to care about the characters. Wolverton is clearly a talented and gifted writer, but I couldn't fathom a whole lot of sympathy for Brynn, the woman in a coma whom everyone is rallying around.	2003-02-11

This is a rare gem about a lesbian mother and her teenage son without the earnest eagarness of the \\"Heather Has Two Mommies\\" genre. The son is funny and sarcastic and has weird sexual experiences of his own; indeed some of the scenes involving his various girlfriends are a little bizarre. But they're fun, and it's real. Though no one wears bellbottoms anymore or says things like super-fabulous, this novel is still very relevant.	2003-02-11

Instead, they talk about all kinds of people who fit outside gender norms, and argue that it is more complicated than we thought. If more people are included in this category, there is a better chance of fighting for acceptance. Gender equality is the latest battle in the quest for civil rights, and it's an interesting one. <br />But this is more than gender theory. The personal stories are all thought-provoking. I found myself thinking about them long after I stopped reading them. You will too.	2002-11-24

Telling the story from various inanimate objects is a clever way to tell the story from an omniscient narrator. But something gets lost in the process and Valdes takes just a bit too long to tell us their love story. I was able to read 100 pages in one sitting, but I was unable to finish it.	2002-10-06

But Kalman does just that through wonderful text and illustrations. Kalman had a head start as the Harvey story is such an uplifting story to begin with--a boat that was put out to pasture is put to good use again during a time of great need. Who wouldn't like a story like that?	2002-10-05

US	40530976	R3C6X51WM24IP6	1573225444	807757533	Loving Edith	Books	4	1	1	N	N	funny and sad	The characters in Loving Edith are quirky, funny and sad, but never pitiful or unsympathetic. This is quite an accomplishment considering the snooty world of literary magazines that Tannen is writing about. Has the author ever worked at a literary magazine? I wonder if this novel really IS based on some of the figures from the New Yorker. At any rate, a charming read, one that will stay with you, cliche and all.	2002-10-05

One could make the argument that her tone can be condescending at times--home-health care aides aren't always entirely honest--but it didn't take away from my enjoyment. In fact, I read it in one day.	2002-10-02

And many of the scenes that take place are highly unrealistic, which ordinarily would annoy me. There are other annoying quirks, such as the &quot;Mental Notes.&quot; But I liked Anne Murphy, silliness and all. I read this in a day because it was fun and a diversion from most of the serious stuff I read for a living.	2002-10-02

Jess Wells is a well-known writer and editor within the community, and this book of essays from glbt parents and activists dares to be controversial. It asks difficult but necessary questions and doesn't pretend to come up with easy answers. I hope Wells writes/edits more on this issue.	2002-08-31

The stories of the father's gay lover, the young lesbian couple, and the closeted gay cop are also equally intriguing. And sadly, it shows that even though a lot has changed for the LGBT community, a person like Jeanne Colter (an obvious riff on Anita Bryant) could still cause havoc for the gay community even if they reside in a large city like NY. <br />I have not read any of Warren's other books, but now I will.	2002-08-09

I wanted to read stories from the entire 30-year friendship rather than focusing so much detail on the early years. Granted a story about two life-long women friends has been done millions of times before, but that's what this is. <br />Also, the developing friendship between Zoe and Jess is contrived at best. I liked Zoe and understood her quest to find out about her mother. But if the generation gap is everything the authors say it is, is a middle-aged women really going to spill her guts to a 20something stranger just because she's her best-friend's daughter? I enjoyed reading it, just found it a little unbelievable. <br />And why did it take two people to write this novel? Is it a barely-fictionalized tale of their own friendship?	2002-08-03

And sure enough, it's not as good as her first novel, but the complex relationship between the two lovers is fascinating. Anshaw takes the time to explore and examine all of her characters and therefore it is an in-depth look at relationships of all kinds. I liked how the ending left the reader hanging; to neatly tie the ending with a nice bow would have been disingenous at best.	2002-07-28

But the 52 capsules of people's lives--not all of them well-known but they're people you should know about--are fascinating. Some personal favorites are the guy who invented the U.S. zip code and the founder of an AIDS group in a small town.	2002-07-22

Graff's history of marriage is very illuminating and her argument for same-sex marriage is persuasive, but she does tend to beat the reader over the head with it at times. Similarly, I enjoyed Graff's biting witticisms but also found it was overdone at times.	2001-12-23

For all the issues it tackles--gay parenting, gay marriage, mental illness, relationships between older men and younger women and a few complicated legal issues thrown in for good measure--it's a light, enjoyable read. The only thing I didn't get were the references to clothing designers when describing someone's appearance. I have never seen that before in a novel and thought it was quirky.	2001-11-26
