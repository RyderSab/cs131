To be sure the story of the superheroes led by Batman overthrowing a corrupt world government led by Lex Luthor isn't the best in the world. The overabundance of splash pages and lack of dialogue made it a very thi story but what sinks this graphic novel is how horible it looks. The draftmanship is crude even by Miler's standars and it looks like it was inked with a chisel or a  dental drill because the linework is so ragged. The coloring  by Lynn Varley is particularly awful especially considering her talent; it is perhaps the most garishly looking blotch job  I have seen in a major project. There is none of the nuance or texture that she normaly brings to her work. Miller has some humorous characterzations and does fairly well with the action so it gets two stars instead of one but it is not worthy of the format or worth the price. It should have bee put on newsprint instead; at least the colors would not be as gros and even th idea might have come of better.	2002-08-21

It is a graphic novel about Moore's interpretation of the Jack the Ripper murders and is buttressed by excellent research  which is included in an appendix at the end of the story. Moore's use of dialogue and potrayal of the complexity and intrigue of the Ripper case are both first rate and Eddie Campbell's grim often grotesque art works here as well.

The multiplicity of visual motifs from a very basic pencilled line that is very impressive to painting and highly skilled photo collages show a visual versatility that is formidable by itself. I was surprised at the skill of his writing, At first reading, I thought Cages was merely a self referential book on the nature of creativity.But further readings show that the  novel also discusses the nature of God, sex and human relationships and the way in which  any or all aspects of human existence can tun into a cage if one  does not have  balance and perspective. The jazz musician poet is the character who comes closest to having this and is the most admirable character in the novel; he is able to live outside of the cage most of the time. This graphic novel meets the definition of art in that second and even seventh readings or viewings add to the experience while well done entertainment has little to say beyond a first or maybe second reading, All serous comics lovers should read Cages and preferably more than once.NBM took over the publishing fromthe defunct  former publisher so it should be easier to find or get by way of special order.	2002-07-04

Its humorous tone keeps it from being a masterpiece like ABSALOM ABSALOM and THE SOUND AND THE FURY but it is not just a work of lighthearted escapism as the issues of temptation and trying to get an easy score are covered with insight and the prose both in terms of dialogue and narration are at the high level we expect from Faulkner.

Sometimes Miller stretches the  iconic  nature of his milieu and it degenerates into nihilsm as in BIG FAT KILL but this book avoids that. It is both reasonable that Marv gets revenge and is punished for his vigilantism which lacks the heroic elements that Hartigan and Wallace display in later SIN CITY novels.

Batman, in Miller's view is   the real superman. He is a Neitschean hero who is too big to be judged by normal standards of morality so those who comment on hom in the novel look foolish. This bigness is why Jim Gordon allowed him to  operate as he did in his prime and why Ellen  Yindel does not try to stop him whenn he tries to bring order to Gotham after the Soviets launch their  nuclear weapon.Gotham is transformed by Miller into a truly gothic city for the first time; the movies and subsequent Batman comics are merely copying what he did in this book and the creepiness of the villians only serves to reinforce the epic scale of the book as does the conflict with Superman.This is one of the best superhero coics ever, but I am dubious about the upcoming sequel.	2001-05-27
