I didn't know what \\"closing\\" was, and besides my ability to never accept the word \\"No\\", I was clueless.  Then I found this gem on the shelf at a bookstore way back in the early 80's, and the world of professional sales was opened up for me.  I highlighted almost every page! <br /> <br />I find myself writing this review today after recommending this book yet again to someone whose husband is entering sales. <br /> <br />Yes, some of the techniques seem a bit dated, or maybe even \\"hard sell\\", but nonetheless they are still very applicable and useful.  I have read a number of books on selling, and few has as much to offer in one volume as this one! <br /> <br />Money well spent!	2005-04-29

If you told me someone could mix up a story with parts of wall street, treasure hunting, publishing, interpersonal relationships, celebrities, and more, I would wonder what you were smoking!  yet, following a true story of how a bunch of Wall Street'rs and treasure hunters fleeced a whole bunch of other people while all the while convincing themselves they were being honest -- well this could have been the bluepring for later stories like Enron.  Light, fast, and funny, this is a great read!	2005-04-17

When it is time to learn to work that bass drum off the beat, then it is time to get this book! <br /> <br />Lombardo gives a number of two-bar patterns (many of which could easliy be called funk beats) involving bass, snare, hi-hat (on the 2 & 4) and ride.  Below each pattern, he gives you the same two bars with just the ride and the bass, allowing you to focus on playing the bass off the eigth-note ride.  the patterns become progressively harder, and your right foot become progressively better (and faster). <br /> <br />This was the 2nd \\"full kit\\" book I worked out of, and it did me wonders.  If you are a beginner, it will do wonders for you as well!	2005-01-23

Joel Rothman was a prolific writer of drumming (and other) books up thru the mid 1970's.

Most drum books contain lessons, or, at least some lessons and some text.  This book is all text, and some \\"life lessons\\".  Billy Ward gives you the up-front and frank discussion maybe-nobody-ever-gave-you about \\"making it\\", practicing, \\"the business\\", playing with a clear head (and maybe not so clear band-mates) and more. <br /> <br />I don't think this book will change your drumming life, BUT, if you don't usually read stuff like this I feel sure you will find it interesting.  Certainly a lot of little tid-bits of knowledge from the game of \\"life\\" as experienced by a musician and drummer who has been in the game a while. <br /> <br />Whay not five stars?

I just completed reading this book in one sitting.  What an amazing compendium of election fraud.  Yes, the overwhelming amount cited is by Democrats (and John Fund notes that early on and why).  Yes, Republicans do it to.  But more amazingly, he cites instance after instance of how America, the shining beacon for hope & freedom in the world, has the most broken, fragmented and fraud-prone voting system that can be found.  Between the fraud-prone legislation of \\"motor-voter\\", rantings of (unproven and unfounded) \\"voter intimidation\\" if someone is actually asked to PROVE who they are, and outright theft of elections, it is clear our system is broken.  No checks & balances, no accountablility.    I became interested in this book as a result of the current WA State Governor's contested election (see [...] for more timeline) and all it's double-votes, dead voters, illegal voters, felon voters, and numbers of polling ballots that outnumbered those who actually showed up at the polls.  I had thought all that died with Mayor Daley (the senior) in Chicago years ago.  But it is alive and well folks.  And not just in WA State now, but all over the country.    Despite the fact that a majority of voters from BOTH major parties want accoutability of WHO is voting, time and time again basic ideas of picture ID's or thumbprints are routinely killed off under the guise it will lead to \\"disenfranchisement\\" of minorities.  Yet, south of the border in a country known for it's corruption of public officials, both are required to vote.  Yes folks, even MEXICO has a more secure voting system than we do!    Read it and weep.  We are slowly losing our greatest right, that of fair elections, to powerful unelected interests.  What a shame.	2005-01-20

I would guess it does not get the attention it deserves because it does not have a \\"big name\\" associated with it nor is it a rudimental study book.

The majority of the book provides a number of two bar rhythms to practice along with 8th and 16th note hi-hats.  Almost all of the beats require a good 16th note ability on bass and snare drum and if you haven't got this down yet, this is the wrong book for you.    While I definitely recommend this book as an excellent volume, I suggest Jim Payne's Funk Drumming book as a precursor.  It will take you to where this book really begins.    Also, this volume is NOT set up anything like Pickering's Studio Jazz book (which I also own and highly endorse).  So if you already own that volume, expect a very different approach from this one.	2004-10-20

I have said this before in other reviews and I will say it again, everything Jim Payne puts out is just phenominal.  His approach to teaching from simple to complex, plus the volume of material and the progressions and styles, makes this book a huge plus for any drummer to own.    Even if you are not into funk drumming, you could start out in this book as a rank beginner with little drumset training and progress faster than you ever thought possible.  The rhythms make sense, and the new edition has a CD to play along with to help you out.    I do not know Jim personally, but I won 3 of his books now, and I would not hesitate to recommend them to any drummer out there.	2004-10-20

In addition, I want to add that there are times it takes people who are NOT a part of the normal process to see and improve the process from the outside.  Most great inventors were from \\"the outside\\" looking in.  To be required to have \\"an educator\\" attached to their book infers they have nothing to contribute unless it contains the normal educational myopia of someone who is a part of the system.<br />In every sport, field, discipline of life, there are always innovators -- and many come from without.  One of my personal favorites was Bill Boomer, a man who became a swim coach (with no prior swimming or swim coaching experience) and turned the entire swimming world upside down with his theories and methods.  Now everyone is learning to swim his way.  In drumming, ONE drummer changed the grip for just about every other drummer out there.  J.K Rowling took the publishing world by storm with no \\"industry\\" experience.

He also suggests strategies to take to avoid loss &amp; possibly gain more in the future.<br />Is there anything REALLY new in here?  Nah.  But has anyone taken the time to thoroughly analyze, dissect, and explain the market in the same way John has, WITHOUT the fluff?  Nope.  Does he back up every postulation and idea with fact?  ABSOLUTELY!

It's why we are the fattest people on the planet with the most stress related illnesses.

The accompanying CD has over 50 tracks playing not only the examples of the book, but actual songs from the career of Tito -- some from groundbreaking albums like Puente in Percussion (all percussion band w/bass ala. avante garde Birth of the Cool in jazz), and the original and now world-known &quot;Oye Coma Va&quot; written by Tito &amp; recorded well before Sanata.

Take one middle aged guy, throw in the history of him watching a decade or so go by, toss in some past memories, a few friends, a few fishing trips, a little regional history &amp; folklore,some biased political commentary and what do you get...?  A decent read.  BUT by no means a great read.  <br />I like to row (scull) and have read most, if not all, of the &quot;sports/autobiographical&quot; rowing tomes out there -- and there are few.  I KNOW when an author has really let it all hang out for the world to see.  This book falls into that same &quot;sports/autobiographical&quot; category.  One of the few written dealing with the emotional side and contect of a specific sport as applied to life (in this case fly fishing).  You can write this stuff around any sport you engage in for some time.  Find the meaning, draw the analogies, etc.  However in Raines case, and for an experienced writer, he could have just done sooo much better.  It's not the feelings he shares, it's the emotions he leaves out.  He does NOT let it all hang out.  The passion just isn't there like one might think it should be.  Pivotal events are often deal with as passings of time.  Unlike other autobiographical books I have read, this one left me wanting to share it with.. nobody.  And that is a shame because I am not that hard to please...  <br />If this were a movie you would wait till it came to video and the big name videos were already checked out...<br />BTW, if you want to try something interesting, try &quot;Rowing Against the Current&quot; to experience personal sports writing where the author really lets you in...	2001-06-15
