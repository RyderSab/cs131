Max Hayes arrives on the scene and convinces Clay to leave behind his meager career and move into swank offices and become the hotshot in the legal world.  The money scenarios he throws at Clay are<BR>unbelievable and the case he is giving him I have read before in a novel. What makes this novel work is Grisham  can take a yarn and spin into a masterpiece. Before Clay can catch his breath he is raking in millions of dollars and has more cases for civil action that he can imagine. His colleagues who traveled this<BR>path with him are starting to get preoccupied with the money and don't see the bridges burning underneath them. In the end Clay gets what he really wanted when he took the first case.    Grisham   last two novels were lackluster in my opinion and wrote for the big screen. In this novel he wrote with passion and didn't let the lure of Hollywood force his characters into stereotype situations and the ending wasn't abrupt.  Since<BR>I read this book in 24 hr. I must rate it a 10 which it greatly earned in my opinion.	2003-02-25

She bothers him everday about his<BR>cases and ask question after question. Upon coming to work one day, she discovers a robbery in progress and her world is turned upside down. Molly manages to irritate everyone with her determination to find the criminal. Her actions place in her danger and it is up to Daniel Sullivan to rescue her from her<BR>shortcomings. This sequel is not as tightly written as the debut novel. I found myself skimming the last third of the book as Molly actions were just over the top where the plot was headed.

Julie is trying to make him happier with an<BR>decadent lunch when he gets a call From Abe.  Back in 1982 they were both on a dig that was shut down due to dangerous conditions and a theft. He leaps at the chance to be back digging in dirt and discovering the lost secrets of the Maya Tribe. As the title suggest their is a curse on the place whether it is real or<BR>someone is manipulating accidents to fit the clues only the reader can deduce that. Gideon is a character that<BR>is easy to like and Elkins surrounds him with great settings and cast of characters that make the plot move forward without effort.  Since these books take place in the 1980's it is interesting to see how they determine cause of death and identify bones without the modern technology of DNA and computers. I can't<BR>wait to read more of this series as Elkins has Gideon keeping up with current trends in his field. Unlike Sue Grafton ( Kinsey Milhone series) who doesn't equip her with modern convinces like a cell phone, I can't wait until Gideon meets a computer.	2003-02-17

This woman doesn't't want help and thinks everyone is trying to kill her. As things escalate Savannah learns this is a neurotic family about to implode upon herself. I didn't enjoy this novel as the mystery was poorly done and I didn't care who the killer was nor the motive for it. Bringing in another of her siblings for added drama was a bad idea. And the normal cast of supporting characters were lifeless in this novel and offered no support to the plot.	2003-02-15

Billy Nichols is a sports reporter and is beat is the boxing world and he befriends many boxers and managers<br />covering the sport.  On the very first page Muller sets the bar high by having the murder committed and the murder revealed all by page 2. Nichols role in all this is the cover up. He helps the boxer clean up the crime scene and remove the body. Now remember this is the 1940's and DNA technology wasn't invented to the<br />caliber of what we have today. The rest of the story is told by Billy and his fast stepping to keep ahead of the deceptive assigned the case. Since Muller set his sights so high so early in the book the middle falls flat. He knew where he wanted the story to go he just couldn't grasp the words to get it there. Close to the ending the story picks up the high pace of the beginning chapters and the ending is full of tension. The big<br />question is will Billy be found out about his accessory to the crime and go to jail or will Muller save his character so we can have other book about him.	2003-01-30

He doesn't waste too many pages setting up his characters, explaining their relationships to each other or any subtle clues on when or where the mystery will occur. Instead he gives  us a character who is original yet funny but  has had his share of bad luck. Ron  grew up in Chicago and had a rough childhood. An older cop took him under his wing and convinced to serve in the army. Upon his return he joined the men in blue in protecting the rough streets of Chicago while on duty one day something goes wrong and he is no longer a cop. The author hasn't fully told this story but his friends are sympathetic to him as he begins a career as a private detective. While all this is going on, he is also working out for a fight in the ring where boxing and kick boxing is combined into an event. His current case is for an old friend who is trying to locate a missing fiancee.  As Ron works the case, he learns that Carlos uncovered a dirty secret for the company he was employed.  Black uses an old plot of a company doing deceitful things and hiding under dummy corporation to fly under the radar of the government.  The originality comes from the way Black uses action to propel the plot to the end. I figured<BR>out early on what the secret was but by that time I wanted to see how Ron would figure it all out. And Ron works hard to apprehend the persons in the company he rubs the investigator on the case the wrong way and ends up solving the case his way. If you like Myron ( Harlan Coben ) or Elvis ( Robert Crais) or even Patrick ( Dennis Lehane) give this new author a chance. He will be a master storyteller like Connelly soon.	2003-01-22

She has just been diagnosed with MS and instead of her supervisors supporting her and helping her with medical<BR>disability they want her to quit.  As she is organizing her new desk she comes across a letter from Dorie who thinks her friends are being murdered by a killer who is using their fears against them. The police reports all point to accidental or suicidal deaths but Linda feels in her gut that this letter is legitimate. After confirming Dorie's story and reviewing the case files it is determined that a stalker is terrorizing people who have phobias.  After getting Pender to hang around unofficially on the case and convincing the bosses to set up a task force the story goes south. At this time I get tired of the mini chapters inside each chapter that pulls the plot apart and makes it very difficult to follow the train of thought of the book.  Nasaw also compromises the integrity of the case by having too many characters get emotionally attach to the case the ending was forced instead of a smooth conclusion like he did in Girls He Adored.	2003-01-21

Peter knows she witness something that night but she believes she is reliving the massacre of the Turks by the Armenian army in the 1930's. I have loved this series from the first book and with the third this duo writing team holds it together. We see Peter at work handling his duties at the Pearce<BR>Institute, working on this case and we see more of his personal life. A couple years ago he put away a deranged killer and now it seems that this man is stalking him from behind bars.  So while we are watching Peter become paranoid like Nick this author spends a great tale that is disappointing in the end. About two<BR>thirds into the book, I thought I had it all figure out but when the conclusion is revealed it made me sad. I felt disappointed that they wove such a tight plot to leave fall flat at the end. I still give it a 9 but the ending should of been different.	2003-01-06

She doesn't bother to set the tone for the book or catch up readers who may have forgotten or not read her first no vel. Within a few paragraphs a confrontation occurs between teenagers that sets the plot for the entire book. What was suppose to be a quiet night at the skating rink turns deadly as one teenager says to another you will pay for what you did. The aftermath is a shoot out with the chief of police, a dead child and a dead baby. This all occurs in the first twenty pages, the other three hundred and some pages is the telling of a complex tale of evil. Jeff is looking at this case as teenagers who think the only solution to their problems is a gun. With so much of this in the news, that is how the readers are led to believe. But quickly events and evidence and even a few weird comments prove that he is not looking at a teenager scorn but a teenager looking for vengeance. Slaughter pulls no punches as she delivers a story that is hard to read but captivating at the same time. Her plot still has a few weak moments as she forced a scene to happen to give Jeff another avenue to explore in this case. I think she could of have this evidence present itself in a different light. I cannot say more about the case without spoiling the read. I will say the heart of the case will have you shuddering at times and the ending is the right ending. Others may disagree with me, but considering how long the criminals have been pulling this off and the set up they have they were too smart for the cops in this investigation. One other strong point is the character development she ropes around this plot. Lena is recovering from the last novel and how she copes with it, is true but painful to read.	2002-12-30

For some reason, I never picked up another by this author so when I saw her latest on the new book shelf I grabbed it. And what a delightful fun read it is. It took some time to gain momentum and when it did it took off like a rocket. Set in the 1880's in New Mexico, Addie is a madam for a run down brothel. She takes in strays noone else wants or needs anymore. Her right hand<BR>woman is named Welcome and is free with her opinions. Her  female workers have more rocks in their brains than common sense. And then we meet Emma. She has come from back east to meet her new husband and start a new life. Instead she is befriended by<BR>Emma and left all alone at the train station. One last character is Ned who is a bank robber and a con artist. After Dallas gets the characters into place the plot picks up and one thing after another goes on.  Ned decides he needs one last bank robbery and he will then settle down with Addie and be respectable. Emma decides to con her brother out of money so she can buy her land and be respectable. Addie decides she will go along with these lives so she can quit the business and retire. All these characters have an agenda of their own and watching them accomplish it is funny. This is where it gets hard to tell the<BR>story without giving away the ending.

I outgrew the bodice ripping romance novels years ago and have a distaste for romance in my mystery novels. But with this author I make an exception, \\"The Notebook and A Walk to remember\\" evoke strong emotions that a book normally wouldn't force to the surface. \\"Message in a Bottle<BR>and Bend in the Road\\" were more modern stories that didn't move me as much. This novel hints on the emotions of his earlier works. Adrienne is looking for a way to reach her down Amanda who is drowning in grief over the death of her husband. She tells her daughter the story of one magical week spent at a bed and breakfast inn on the coast of the ocean. A man arrives looking for forgiveness on a death he caused while performing surgery on a patient. Adrienne is just looking to find meaning in her life after a bitter divorce. These two souls come together and pledge to make a life together. after he returns from Peru. This is a<BR>typical Sparks story and I knew the ending long before we got there kept this book from being a 10. It is just the kind of books I need between mysteries and to keep hope alive in this world we live in.	2002-12-26

In the past I read \\"See Jane Run\\" and highly recommend it to all I talk books to. I then read her latest `<BR>Whispers and Lies\\" another mind tingling read. This book leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The main character is a family therapist and it seems Fielding has given her the most dysfunctional family in the world. Kate has a mother who is either losing her mind<BR>or plotting to kill her neighbors in the senior citizen complex. Her sister Jo Lynn who has airhead down to an art, opens the morning paper and decides her true love is the serial<BR>killer on trail for killing nine woman. While we are at it, throw in a perfect daughter who worships her mother like an idol, the out of control  teenager who has no feelings for anyone but herself and the husband who hovers on the sidelines. With all this going on, the plot is lame and the ending did nothing to support the story. Every great author has a bad day and I hope this is Fielding's. I have her many great things about this author and will give her another chance. Rating 7	2002-12-26

She takes her dim  witted boyfriend with her and they find mostly junk. One picture catches Claire's eye and she keeps it. After checking out the picture and taking a last minute whim trip to New York. She quickly has people looking for her and wanting this picture. It seems that the Nazis took it from a family who wants it back. At times this book got lost and Henry threw anything trying to make the book work. Clair job as a vanity plate approver provides a few comical moments and I had funny trying to decipher the acronyms. Sadly this story didn't connect the dots and the solution to the mystery was not supported by the clues woven in the story. I tried this series out since this author also wrote \\"Learning To Fly\\" which many refer to her as her breakout novel.  I know this author has potential and I will read the next in the series.	2002-12-24

Russell Lee Holmes was put to  death for murdering six young children. And on the same night  a 9 year old child found <BR>drugged and abandoned at a Boston hospital. One of the murdered children is Meagan and her father just happens to be a prominent doctor at the hospital. Through their money ties they are able to adopt the child and go ahead with their lives. Now it is 20 yrs later and Melanie receives a call claiming she is the real child of Russell Holmes.  Reeling from this shock she must also confront the FBI agent who is after her father. As she<BR>begins to dig into her family's past and reconstruct her own dubious past many questions arise. Is it possible she is the daughter of the man who killed her adoptive parent's daughter? Is her adopted father really a con artist? Does her mother hide her sorrows in the bottle or does she have a much deeper secret. Gardner writes in a fast style that doesn't give the readers time to breathe. This is a top notch thriller with many elaborate<BR>twists to an intricate plot. I can't give it a 10 which it so richly deserves but it made my head hurt trying to keep all the known facts straight and sort out the sleazy rumors.	2002-12-24

Terry is a middle age woman who is lonely in her life and lives in the house she was raised. She rents out the cottage on the property to young women. Still sad from the sudden disappearance of her previous tenant she lets Allison bulldoze her into moving in without checking references.  Told in part by Terry's point of view on events and Allison take on the same events readers are led to believe that we know the whole story. Allison is a highly motivated woman who is about to swindle Terry out of her home and money.  As we keep reading<BR>waiting for this end, Fielding begins to weave her magic. Terry begins to check out Allison's stories which have no truth to them and then she is stalked by her former tenant's boyfriend. This is becoming a predictable story of taking advantage of a lonely person and slowly driving them nuts. At this point I almost gave up on the story and went to the last chapter. For some reason the writing compelled to keep reading just a couple more chapters. I am glad Fielding has the writing ability to keep readers hooked even when the storyline starts to fall apart. As the ending approaches I had to reopen my mind and accept startling new<BR>evidence which turn this book from a dud to a must read.	2002-12-23

Everett seems to be the perfect suspect for all the murders but<BR>is someone setting him up for a bigger fall? Only Kava knows and she takes her time in peeling off the multi layered plot. Not as strong as her first novel the follow up remains strong in police procedural and gives the reader a few ice cold moments when you finally determine who is the mastermind behind the sinister plot. <BR>Some elements of Maggie's life was not necessary such as her relationship to her mother, even though it gave credence to the cult ability to brainwash vulnerable victims.	2002-12-21

She becomes obsessed with plot of the movie as it is based loosely on a true crime. She thinks she can solve the case find the money and live happily ever after. This plot is hard to follow at times and sometimes I don't think the author is aware of what he wants the characters to do.  I have read his later books and know he can write a good thriller. Too bad this book falls flat, I believe his publisher re-released to capitalize on his famous status. I will read more of the scout series and might try the next one in this series just because Rune is such a likable character.	2002-12-17

He shows us the side of the prosecution take on a case and even though they are suppose to get convictions he makes sure the evidence will support the claim. So when his father asks him to work on  appeal  on a case from his past Andy has many questions that his Pop can't answer as he is dead of a heat attack. As a last request to his father, he looks into the case and finds that a proper  investigation was either blotched or roadblock at each turn. Also while going through his father's estate he learns some disturbing things about his father. Andy must continue to work the case while he deals with the aftermath of his father's death. He is also working on saving his marriage or walking away from it all.<BR>Rosenfelt gives the reader a fresh new character who tells it like it is, gives us a chance to laugh at the justice system and the mystery is well supported by the evidence woven into a well written plot.

This is a noble gesture but after thugs attack him, he is framed for a murder and his co workers start to turn on him you begin to wonder how stupid henry is. The only saving grace in this book was the last 1/4 of the book. Here Connelly returns to his high energy fast paced writing we have come to love in his Series on Harry Borsch. I have read his other Stand Alones which had plausible plots and strong<BR>characters this book is just weak. The other thing that bothered me is he postponed this release after September 11 out of respect. I can't see any connection between the plot of<BR>this book and that terrible day.

Nanny is hired to take care of Grover while his parents have a life.  This poor child is so starved for his dad's attention that I felt sorry for him. His mother is more concerned with getting him in the right preschool and teaching him Latin than to hear about his day at the playground. The mother in this book has this kid eating strange foods I never heard of, taking classes that were meant for high school students and putting him fourth or fifth to every other event in her life. When she discovers her husband's infidelity, she doesn't realize what goes around comes around but plots to get pregnant again to save her materialistic lifestyle. I hope this book is the exception to how the  rich treat their hired help and offspring but I don't think so. I remember when this book first hit the bookstores, many uppercrust families were in an uproar and wanted it banned from publication. I hope it was a wakeup call and they see their children as a human being and not an object to placed on a shelf when not wanted. This book had some funny moments in it and will give all parents no matter the financial   status of their lives, some things to think about.	2002-12-11

This story is based for a moment on a true case. A body of a young woman was found dead in a quarry over 20 yrs ago. She has never been claimed or identified. Compounding the case is in this era, many young people fled their lives for a new start in San Francisco with the flower power. Sadly Grafton spends her yarn so far out, she has a hard time catching the end and wrapping up the story. Kinsey is introduced to her family again, befriends two old time cops and heads off on a road trip. This was not necessary to the story and weighed it down in unnecessary dialogue.  The mystery she created around this discovery of the<BR>body was strong and believable.  It fit with the time period of the death and the results still affect people's lives today.  It seems lately either when an author becomes established or the editor uses a spell check program a lot of editing is left  ndone. If this book would of been stripped down to the mystery it would of been a hit. But since I had to read so many passages but family misgivings and people wanting a second chance I lost interest.	2002-12-11

The thing is he is great at tracking down the killers so he gets a special assignment title and an office in the basement. The police force overlooks his discretion's because of his proven track record. He also has a literal love affair with the media. He is involved with one anchorwoman as he strings another along with tidbits on the cases. To further complicate matters he has a relationship with a victim of the killer. Normally these antics turn me off a novel, Sanford has the gift of writing that makes Lucas a male gigolo with brains. As for the case, a killer is after a certain<BR>type of woman ( aren't  most serial killers), but he leaves notes behind telling them about his methods. He is a highly skilled intelligent person who loves to taunt the police. He is always one step ahead of them and calls Lucas to let him know this. Lucas becomes obsessed with this case and the reader is forced to keep reading to unravel the truth. This book has all the makings of a masterpiece.

They are fairly accurate on mystery for me as many they recommend I have already read. After reading \\" Miss Julia Takes Over\\" I was looking for similar southern style stories and hit on this one. Maggie is a 38 yr old woman who<BR>married right after high  school and now her twins are about to graduate and leave the nest. She feels restless in her marriage and her life is stuck at boredom. The last straw is when her straight laced husband buys cemetery plots with money that was save to take a cruise after the children leave for college. To<BR>complicate matters, her high 20th yr high school graduation is around the corner and she feels her life is a failure. She didn't set the world on fire or even follow her dreams of being a hair stylist. As she reminisces about her life her high school love returns to town. This is the start of a torrid romance that soon the whole town knows about but not her husband. At this point the author does some twisting to give Maggie her out of her bland life, an opportunity to own a beauty shop and to gain a lost love again. In all still a good read when you don't want to tax your brain.	2002-09-21

The Town Lily dale also is a character in this book. It is a town that does exist for the paranormal community. These are physics who can reach the other side and people flock to this town to connect with lost loved ones. Staub brings the town to life but doesn't force the readers to believe in ghosts. She gives you the story and lets you make your own decisions. The mystery is able to stand on its own merits without needing any supporting plots. Not only did Kristin die under  mysterious circumstances, another girl of similar age was shipped off to boarding school never to be seen again. Staub weaves these<BR>stories together and it becomes a read you can't put down as you read just one more chapter. The only thing I found wrong with this plot was the introduction of a character that could have a link to the missing girl (don't want to give anything away here) and two people who roam the county looking for ghosts. Whether<BR>you believe in ghosts or not the mystery and surprising  onclusion will keep you spellbound. Rating 9	2002-09-14
