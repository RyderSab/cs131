However the accounts of the `99 trip were down right tedious up until the story reaches the First Camp.  In the first part of the book, tales of getting the gear, the sponsors, getting thru customs and the various slight ailments of the various climbers are neither interesting nor compelling.  After that, it builds.<br />Not a bad book, but the first half really could have used some editing.	2001-06-28

Contradicts herself far too often (as where she calls for greater commuinity control over what and how social services are provided, but then later says the Federal Government must control the process since state and local governments can't be trusted to provide specific services).<br />Another glaring flaw is her tendency to cite marginal writings by fringe academics in support of her proposals.  Most of those proposals, by the way, call for a massive new infusion of taxpayer money.<br />The first two chapters are a very good concise analysis of current social service provision.  After that the book peters out in a mish-mash of muddled thinking.	2001-05-24

Can't say I agree with 100% of his veiwpoints, but I like the way he writes.  His ability to capture in a few words the thrust of his argument or obnservation makes for very powerful reading.<br />The parts that made me laugh out loud are any of his pieces describing campus politics.  Although I certainly sympathize with certain minority groups on my campus, Leo does a nice job of explaining how campus liberals have become vapid shells clining onto some radical past.  <br />A good book to spend the afternoon with.	2001-02-01

It dawns on you after a while that even 12 years later these people have not worked thru the pain of their daughter's death.  The result is that this book devolves into a never-ending emotional mish-mash.  Surprisingly, by the end of the book I had lost most empathy for the Cohens and, as harsh as this sounds, found them quite pathetic.<br />I also found it downright rude their back-biting of other families who did not share their passion for wallowing in the loss of a loved-one.<br />A sad book.<br />.	2000-12-03

The first three chapters are lumbering and ponderous with way  too many cliches. But starting on chapter 4, Flags of Our Fathers becomes  one of the more compelling books I've read in years.  The battle, the  photograph and the aftermath are told in a very engaging way.  James  Bradley and Ron Powers did an excellent job of bringing a humanizing touch  to the characters involved.	2000-06-16

It's about competitive balance, because the product is the  sport as a whole, not just the Yanks or the Braves.  With revenue sharing,  Stienbrenner and Turner have an economic stake in the attendance of an  Expos-Pirates game or a kid in Puget Sound purchasing a Mariners jersey.  Costas notes that these are smart businessmen, and revenue sharing will  give them responsibilities beyond their own market.<br />Costas is the kind of  guy I'd like to have 13-14 drinks with and talk baseball until the  bartender turns out the lights.  He has solutions that are sensible...great  idea to share local TV/radio revenues, the 3-0 playoff (which gets rids of  that crappy Wild Card), and realignment (can't you just smell the radical  disaster brewing in Selig's office as we speak).<br />The only drawback to the  book is the final chapter, where he throws in brief ideas about the DH,  umpires and Pete Rose.  His editors should have cut this as it weakens the  rest of the book.<br />Well worth buying as a gift for your favorite fan.	2000-06-08

It's just a compilation of what Susan Cheever drank,  the places Susan Cheever drank,  the men Susan Cheeer screwed while she was drunk.  We'd get much the same  result of Susan had gone to Kitty Kelley and asked &quot;Will you write a  shallow, vapid account of my life?&quot;<br />Note Found In a Bottle is  self-absored and boringly so. I imagine what keeps Susan awake at night is  that most people have found this account of her drinking years Not Very  Interesting.  She earnestly wants the reader to believe her life was  glamourous, but in fact it's just an average drunk story.<br />I guess there  are worse ways to spend (money) than to throw it away on this book....but not  many.	2000-06-03

He does a really sharp job of higlighting how relatively isolated cases get extrapolated into major trends, ie Granny  Dumping, Pre-teen Pregnancy, Counterfiet Airplane Parts.  All this  generates fear in the citizenry. Other strong points of the book are the  madening cases where the truth is known, but gets smothered in a wave of  emotion-based reporting, ie. breast implants, youth crime, etc.<br />Yea, as  others have noted Glassner can be a little shrill when it comes to guns.   His strident language on this issue kind of sticks out like a sore thumb  since the rest of his writing is fairly objective. Also, I was surprised  that in his section on Metaphoic Illneses that he ommitted any discussion  about the inflated statistics and fear mongering among AIDS advocacy  groups.  In fact, he avoids the AIDS issue altogether. It just seems very  strange that in a book which tackles the formation of popular perceptions  on major issues one of the biggest stories of the past 15 years is left  out. Why? If I ever met Glassner, this would be the first question I'd ask  of him.<br />Other reviewers have mentioned Frank Fuerdi's 1997 book of the  same name.  While Glassner is the better writer, Fuerdi is a lot more  balanced and intellectually honest.  Definitely buy Fuerdi's book and if  you have the extra money buy Glassner's too.	2000-05-26

Most intriguing are the discussions about different legal rules and zoning laws that prevent engineers from trying new designs  that might work better.<br />A real weakness of the book is the lack of  in-depth examination of what works in suburbia.  Highly mobile Americans do  have a choice and they still choose suburbia over rural or urban areas.  Suburbia, for all its drawbacks, seems to offer a clean, safe environment  with housing that remains a good investment. This work could have been  better if its solutions built upon those strengths rather than lay waste to  the neighborhoods where more than half of Americans live.	2000-04-14

A man who had it all and squandered it. The prose is lively and the story is interesting, but one wishes the author had  spent more time getting us inside Hartford's head.  The result is that we  learn a great deal about WHAT he did, but very little about WHY he did it.   Not a bad book to kill an afternoon with but nonetheless a book that falls  short of its potential.	2000-04-09

That I could put up with.  It's Albom's insincerity that destroys his book. This comes out even more so on the audio-cassette version. One can almost envision him sitting at the edge  of his dying mentors bed thinking, &quot;Oh boy, book project!&quot;.  What  that leads to is the anthesis of the message.  It's almost like Albom is  writing in the third person...&quot;I once knew this workaholic named Mitch  who was reunited with his mentor, Morrie, where he learned all these  insights about life....&quot;.  You could hear the publishing wheels  turning in Albom's head throughout the pages.  A disappointing book.	2000-04-08

Ambrose has spent so much of his career tied up in the history of Eisenhower that it really colors his other work.  The post-WWII autobiographies really did paper over the deep divisions between the Americans and Britsh on fighting style.  The Brits favored concentrated,  methodical attack while the Yanks wanted speed, exploitation and movement.  Fifty years later this tension is still evident and comes through in  Ambrose's writing.  The fact that he does not include the Brits in this  tale is no problem, keeping focus just upon that action at Omaha keeps the  book tight.  However, the little snipes at the British do tend to stand out  and detract from the book.<br />Overall, I thought he did well to illuminate  how American training and decentralization of command did much to win the  day at Omaha (that and air power which kept enemy reinforcements and even  top Nazi generals away from the battlefield).<br />The book's title is not  misleading. Despite what some others say, D-Day, along with Stalingrad and  the Battle of Britian, were probably THE key engagements in the European  Theater.  So Ambrose's book title, while still a bit hyperbolitic, is  pretty accurate.	2000-04-05

It's breezy, fast paced and full of good turn-of-a-phrase writing that keeps the reader interested.  Having said that, he still could have benefited from a bit of  editing.  Loping off 100 pages would have helped as the book did drag till  the end.<br />I first found the book lively and engaging, but as I went deeper  into its pages, I began to get an uneasy sense of Horwitz's prejudice.  The  emerging elitist tone of the book comes through and leaves the reader  uncomfortable.  He seems to use his pen as a brush that paints all  Southerners as backwoods, racist, hillbilly rubes.  In Confederates In the  Attic, Horwitz has created a kind of reverse Amos and Andy for the  90s.<br />This would be a fun book to read if there wasn't such an  undercurrent of meanness and intolerance in his writings.  The worst  moments come in the chapter \\"Dying For Dixie\\".  In it, a young  African-American male guns down a young white father of newborn twins  solely because he had a rebel flag flying from his truck. Was anyone else  disturbed by how Horwitz went out of his way to smear the reputation of the  murdered man? How about Horwitz's sympathetic portrait of the killer?  It's  actually downright scary to read.   It's the kind of \\"blame the victim\\"  journalism that I doubt Horwitz would ever try on a rape victim.<br />On the  flip side, Horwitz every now and then comes up with some penetrating  insight.  He made a brilliant observation that, like in 1861, we are once  again wondering if America will remain one nation - that today we are  losing our sense of a common people with common principles and starting to  fracture along class, race and gender lines.  If Horwitz had spent more  time using his travels to expand on issues like this it would have made for  a more powerful book. That and a little less disdain for the proletariat.	2000-03-15

As it says in the book, this is ONE method, not THE method. For those who this does not  work, perhaps they need to go elsewhere.  For those who find success  somewhere else, congratulations.<br />While there has been a general desire  not to mess with the wording of the 1st half of the book, it may do this  book well to undergo editing.  The language used is sometimes out of date  (i.e. - &quot;the gay nightspots&quot; has a very different meaning today  than in 1939). The sentence structure is complex and the paragraphs are  long. This affects the flow and causes the reader to lumber through  numerous passaages.<br />If AA does not want to edit the first half of the  book (which they refer to as the &quot;main text&quot;), perhaps they could  publish a companion &quot;modern day&quot; Big Book - same concepts but  with contempary writing.<br />Still, the book's content is brilliant: doctors,  psychologists, spritiual leaders, law enforcement, etc. have all witnessed  the results and thus supported the book's central themes.  That tells the  reader that there must be some validity here.<br />In the second half of the  book are personal stories of recovery from alcoholism. Some of these are  very powerful: &quot;Fear of Fear&quot;, &quot;Doctor, Alcoholic,  Addict&quot;, &quot;Freedom From Bondage&quot;. Other stories are out of  date (the 3rd edition was published in 1976).  I understand that a 4th  edition is being prepared that will include more stories from gays, blacks,  women, and people from outside the USA.  That should help the readability  of this book a lot.<br />Most AAs read read this book in the company of other  recovering people, which probably helps clarify the confusing language.   Still, freshening up the writing would make the content more accessible to  a larger circle of people.	2000-03-14

Look at this book as a brief glimpse into a teenager's life.  From that perspective, this is a fascinating story.<br />One of the strengths of  this book is that is does not lapse into the weepy introspection or  pop-psychology of most &quot;instant&quot; true life tales that are quickly  rushed to print following some tragedy.  &quot;She Said Yes&quot; is a  straightforward rendition of different perpectives of Cassie Bernall's  trails and tribulations in the 3-4 years before her death. The books  simplicity makes for powerful reading.<br />It's simplicity is also a  weakness. It's understandable that Misty Bernall did not want to go into  lurid detail about Cassie's drug use and sex life. Instead she refers to  these event crypitically.  I think that robs the book of some power in that  we never really get to see the depths of Cassie's darkness before her  spiritaul conversion.<br />I am also intrigued by what else is in Cassie's  diaries.  The excerpts in the book give brief glimpses of a struggling girl  looking to find her place in the world and what this god is in her life.  The book gives just a taste of Cassie's inner thoughts and leaves the  reader hungering for more.<br />Whatever she said in that library that day  does not reduce the impact of this book. This is a fascinating look at a  teen who was turning her life around.	1999-12-19

The first things you notice is the heavy skew towards New York sports  teams. Garner includes the Mets, Jets, Knicks and Rangers  championships...all certainly exciting moments, but none very  &quot;climactic&quot;.  In any of those sports you could have found 20 more  &quot;climactic&quot; moments (quick, hockey fans: wouldn't you have rather  heard the call of either the `72 or `86 Canada Cup?). <br />A noticable  weakness is that Garner goes out of his way to include personalities rather  than moments.  Thus the obligatory inclusion of clips from the careers of  Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan.  All legends,  but the inclusion of such &quot;moments&quot; in this package seems forced  and phony. For example, Garner includes Jordan's sixth NBA crown, when a  far better moment to honor Jordan would have been The Shot against Clevland  in `89.<br />Another problem is Bob Costas' intrusive narration on the CD.  It  would have been better if they had Costas set up the clips and let them run  interrupted.  No where is this more annoying than on the Immaculate  Reception audio clip, where I found myself thinking &quot;Shut up,  Bob!&quot;<br />Not a bad book/CD.  If you have the spare $40 lying around,  there are worse ways to spend it.	1999-11-24
