Rowing is such a detailed writer, with twists and turns all around.  I believe completely that things aren't as they seem.  Appearances can be changed and senses tricked in these books.  That is what is really fun about these books.  Things are so complex, that there is no way anyone can be sure how things will turn out in the end.  J.K. Rowing is not a stagnant writer whose writing is predictable.  This books reveals a lot of new information and creates new questions to be answered in the last book.  Fans will not be completely disappointed, although they will definitely go through mourning at the end.	2005-07-19

I got this book thinking it was a comic book.  I obviously didn't read the description carefully enough.  This is basically a long poem about being a grandmother.  I was disappointed at first, but not I think I'll give it to my mom when she becomes a grandma for the first time.  I do think that it needs to be clear that this is not a comic.  It is simply a poem that is illustrated with FBOW characters.	2005-06-03

The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc.  However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers.  So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had.  The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others.  The kids series seems to be good in every book.  These are not for really young kids, but would be appropriate for young teens.  I enjoy them and I am an adult.	2004-12-25

True, Jill finds out what Wendy is really like, but no one made up with Linda.  I went through some of the things Linda had to go through (thankfully not as severe).  It really bugs me that people spent the whole book treating Linda so terribly and no one even tried to make up with her.  I thought that, at least after what Jill had been through, she'd want to try to make up with Linda.  In the end, she should have decided to try sitting with Linda, instead of Rochelle.  Or maybe Linda and Rochelle.  I think that would have sent a strong and important lesson to children.  Without apologizing to Linda, the book has a gaping hole.  The kids learned not to follow Wendy, but not how to make things right with those they hurt while following Wendy.	2004-11-05

She is a really nice person (so is her daughter:).  What I really like about this book is that she knows what things are really like in Taiwan, since she lived there for many, many years.  The situations Amy gets into are realistic, so it's also a glimps into what life in Taiwan really is like.  A great piece of work Deb!	2004-10-06

This book was lent to me by a friend.  It is an interesting book.  Some of the theories, especially about the possible endings, are crazy, but some are plausible.  Anything is possible in the world of Harry Potter.  If I had read this book before book three and she suggested that Scabbers might not be a rat, I would probably have said she was off her rocker.  But, though, if it all turns out to be a dream in the end, I might scream!	2004-07-27

I kind of felt evil when I kept skipping the parts when Jesus talked.  They tended to overkill ideas.  For example, when everyone hears Jesus say their name at the same time.  I got the idea the first time.  The second time wasn't too bad, but when they repeated the idea over and over, it got boring.  All in all, though, it was an ending.	2004-07-27

All the other books are good, but, because of these reasons, book 3 is the best.	2004-07-05

This book really kept my attention simply because of how odd it is.  It's odd, but interestingly odd.  Lois Lowry does a good job at keeping the mystery going.  She gives you clues all over the place so you can solve the mystery as you go.  It was masterfully written.  It also is full of topics to talk about, such as communism, abortion, euthenasia, etc.  It is a good book to get people thinking.	2004-06-12
