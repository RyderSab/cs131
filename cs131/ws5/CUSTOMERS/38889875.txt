I thought the the hero, Charles, was very undefined.  He just doesn't sound very attractive, and why is he such an unemotional stick?  We are told his mother died when he was a small boy, but - that's IT.  His father was firm but not unloving; in fact the author creates a loving relationship between the hero and his father, and also with his sister.  Why did he become such an unemotional control freak?  The guy doesn't even SMILE until half the book is over.<br /><br />I also had a problem with the fact that the hero basically forces the heroine into marriage.  He never gives her warning of her uncle's financial difficulties and the uncle's theft of her fortune.  I'd find that somewhat hard to forgive!  When the author starts using plot devices like these, weak as day-old tea, just to propel the plot...grrrr.  I can't really recommend this book.	2005-10-04

I managed to get to the point where the hero & heroine have their wedding night, and frankly, I was so bored before that point, I'm surprised I got that far.  I blimmed over the last half to read about the happy ending, but I have no idea how they got there; only that they seemed to have multiple children by the end.<br /><br />Nothing about this book succeeded in maintaining my interest. The American heroine was weak-minded--at first, she seems determined not to marry into the British aristocracy, and wants to head straight back to Texas.  But all her father has to do is remind her of her new-rich mother's humiliation at the hands of Society, and she bows to his wish that she make an arranged marriage, on this basis alone, without further thought or regret.  The hero was a stereotypical \\"tall, dark & handsome\\" kind, with a rotten marriage in his past, which set him right up to be suspicious of the heroine's motives.  All the plot devices of this romance seemed weak and done too many times before (and done better).  A kind of lip service is paid to 19th century aristocratic mores and customs, but historical accuracy seems to take a nosedive.  And this kind of lip service to accuracy does interfere with my enjoyment of a book.  I never understand why some authors set stories in the 19th century if they aren't going to follow through with an accurate presentation of the customs and mannerisms of the era.  These felt like 21st century characters plopped down in a 19th century plot.<br /><br />Quite a disappointment from Lorraine Heath, who wrote the so-much-better \\"A Rogue in Texas\\".	2005-10-03

It began really well, but the heroine Ariane became less and less of a strong heroine and more of a -- not a wimp, exactly -- but her determination to make Ranulf admit he loves her was kind of boring.  And Ranulf's determination NOT to admit that he loves her was a bit tiresome too!  It wasn't the compelling, gripping romance that I expected it would be.  The book could have been shortened by 100 pages and it would have been a better and tighter story.  I was able to put it down and hesitated to pick it up again -- not a good sign.  For Nicole Jordan, it was only a fair effort; much better than some of the recent crud she's written, but it's just not top-notch.  Wait for a used copy.	2005-09-27

Unfortunately, except for the most devoted British Royalty follower, this book is a major disappointment.<br /><br />The photographs are presented in multiple sets, some extremely small, with TINY captions.  It strains the reader's eyes to look at the photos and read the captions!  Every so often, there is a nice large presentation of a special photograph, such as the wedding picture of Queen Elizabeth II's parents, but typically the photographs represented here are in small format, all crowded on one page.  While I'm happy to read Queen Mary's own captions, they did not need to be included for all the photos.<br /><br />The photos themselves are, for the most part, not so interesting as I thought they would be.  (The Royal family, like an ordinary family, has its dull, awkwardly posed moments.)  There are some good ones that are not seen so often, such as the wedding photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Kent, and the family of Mary the Princess Royal, but on a whole, this is not a very interesting selection.<br /><br />Unfortunately, also, Mr. Warwick's essays on the life of Queen Mary contain multiple errors of fact, which a good editor should have caught.	2005-09-14

HEART OF WAR takes place in 1916-17 England and centers around two families, the Rowlands and the Strattons.  There are some absolutely priceless scenes in this novel.  The teatime encounter between the Earl of Swanwick & Bill Hoggin's family is brilliant (the names alone should tell you how that scene goes), and overall, the novel is very nearly as moving to me as \\"Now God Be Thanked\\".<br /><br />Yet, I have to qualify my praise of this excellent novel, because of a certain oddity... HEART OF WAR has more sex in it than \\"Now God Be Thanked\\", which doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, except that, in several instances, the description of sex between certain characters sounds false and hollow, and adds nothing to the book.<br /><br />For instance, there's a sexual encounter between a virgin soldier, Jessop, and a French widow, that's arranged by his comrades in arms.  This situation could easily have been written as sentimental, or contrived, but it rang absolutely true.  The same truth is in the incidents of love between a character, Tom Rowland, and his partner.  But, when Masters describes a sexual encounter between Guy Rowland and his jumped-up-from-nothing-into-an-aristocrat girlfriend, Florinda, that encounter rang false.  The author's including the more graphic sex content somewhat cheapened this story... unless perhaps Masters meant to convey the breaking down; the cheapening, of WWI English society?  It's still a brilliant novel, and my provisos are basically personal. I do highly recommend these books.	2005-08-03

I have to applaud an author who has the audacity to attempt to bring another author's characters to life again, and in a different time frame.  It's difficult in that respect to review this novel because -- what exactly is it that's being reviewed?  If you haven't read \\"The Secret Garden\\", can you read and enjoy this novel on its own merits?  If you have read \\"The Secret Garden\\", is this novel going to be the biggest disappointment of a sequel ever written?  These are difficult, if not impossible questions, for me to answer because it's impossible to separate my perceptions of \\"The Secret Garden\\" (even having read it almost 20 years ago) from this author's take on its characters' futures in \\"Return to the Secret Garden\\".<br /><br />I do think that the author has love and respect for the original characters.  I don't think certain reviewers are quite fair when they accuse the author of pornography, etc.  The author has her own point of view as to how these characters would have evolved into adulthood, and it's not going to match every reader's perceptions.  Do I think the Mary of \\"The Secret Garden\\" would have slept with Dickon AND with Colin?  No.  But, I'm not going to throw a brick at the author because she chose to \\"see\\" this as a possibility... Incidentially, the author was an able enough writer to successfully depict Mary and Dickon's relationship, making it real and interesting, much more believable than Mary and Colin's.<br /><br />Can this novel be read & enjoyed on its own merits?  That's a pretty impossible question since I've read \\"The Secret Garden\\", but I'll take a stab at it...there were most definitely several things I disliked about the book.  Most of the more thoughful reviews on this page hit on them:  certain illogical decisions, such as Mary's marrying Barney and going to India; the creepiness of Mary & Colin's affair and marriage (creepy because of the way Colin's character is written, not just because of the fact that they are cousins); the relentless tragedies that occur in Mary/Dickon/Colin's lives during the course of the story.  Personally, I disliked the first-person prologue - it doesn't add anything to the book, and there's an immediate improvement in the writing once the story moves into the first (third-person) chapter.<br /><br />BUT, having been critical of all that, I really, really liked the character of Dickon.  I thought he was a fully realized fictional character, both as an extension of the Dickon of \\"The Secret Garden\\", AND as a creation of Ms. Moody's.  It made perfect sense that Dickon would return from the horrors of trench warfare and be psychologically damaged, yet somehow, able to recover enough of himself to be the tower of strength that Mary needs, too.<br /><br />On the other hand, I just couldn't see the Mary of \\"The Secret Garden\\", who was growing into a perceptive, sensitive and affectionate girl, being the Mary who wanted selfishly to leave Dickon in that war hospital, and just get on her married life with Barney in India.<br /><br />Mary and Colin...they are, to say the least, interesting characters but not especially likable.  My perception of the characters of Mary and Colin from \\"The Secret Garden\\", which showed them changing from self-centered and unlovable children, did not see them evolving into an ultra-selfish and cold adulthood for Mary {though I could see her as being perhaps somewhat reserved, and reluctant to say \\"I love you\\"}.  I couldn't understand, or anticipate, Colin's continuous emotional fixation on Dickon.  I suppose I can almost see why Mary would marry Colin, if only because class stucture was still everything in those times (1920's Britain).  But in the end I have to agree with the reviewers who disliked the marriage between these characters, and agree that its depiction severely flaws this novel.  It just doesn't make sense, and if it doesn't make sense, it's not \\"true\\".  In fact, from that point, the book began to become a chore to read for me.<br /><br />But I have to give kudos to the author for her realization of the character of Dickon, both as a creation of hers, and as a creation true to the spirit of Dickon of \\"The Secret Garden\\".  He rates my three stars.<br /><br />In conclusion:  to read this as a sequel to a beloved children's classic:  Handle with great care, or not at all.

Despite all the good things about this book, something is lacking.<br /><br />The basic plot is tightly written and a good one.  Katherine (Kate), is abandoned by her husband (who married her basically because he wanted sex with her & she wasn't offering it without marriage).  She's taken into her brother-in-law Noah's home, after the husband is killed in a brawl.  Noah is outwardly scarred from a terrible accident involving barbed wire when he was a young teenager, and inwardly scarred due to his cold upbringing by his stepmonster. (Not a typo.)  Kate is due to have her husband's baby in a few months.  Yet they gradually feel attracted and eventually marry, falling in love with each other as they learn about each other.<br /><br />The writing is all right; the romance is warm and heartfelt, developing slowly (which I like), and the characters are believably motivated.  Noah and Katherine have depth, and I really appreciate Kate's determination to make a go of her new life and her hope for a stronger love with Noah than she'd experienced with his brother.  And yet, somehow, the book is not a keeper.  Maybe it's because the writing is just \\"all right\\", that I'm not feeling it.  Some of the writing is a little abrupt, a little flat, perhaps.<br /><br />It's a good book, even a very good book, but even though it touched all the bases, I feel disappointed with the fact that it wasn't \\"more\\".

And so many of these novels have been, to say the least, sentimental drivel.  But as of this date, I can safely say that NOW GOD BE THANKED is frankly one of the best novels I've ever read, as well as one of the best that uses the carnage and the changes wrought by WWI on England and English families as its theme.<br /><br />The basic plot interweaves the stories of two English families, the Rowlands and the Strattons, and how the war is a force of change in all their lives, but it's so much more than just that.  It has all the emotional power of the old TV series, \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" but I'm not comparing it to that; it's a vastly deeper story.  This is the first book of a trilogy by John Masters and NOW GOD BE THANKED ends in December, 1915.  I can only say that I am eager to find the other two books in the trilogy and find out the futures of all these characters, though I can imagine most will be heartbreaking, particularly for the young men...I was especially impressed with how well the author balanced such a large canvas of characters; every one is given his or her chance and we come to know them - NOT a light read, very involving & thought-provoking.	2005-07-25

The brief description I found of this novel's plot:  the life and times of an English noblewoman who serves as a nurse at the Front, sounded so intriguing.<br /><br />I was disappointed when I opened the book and realized that this novel is written in the first person.  I read the Author's Note - she states her desire to bring the voices of the Great War alive; that she's had a special interest in the era since her childhood.  All well & good, but... I felt a little niggle of dismay.  Her emotion in the Author's Note worried me - I didn't get the impression from her fervency that Ms. Hugheson was going to maintain her emotional distance from this woman's story.  Unfortunately I was proven right.<br /><br />I have to partially agree with the professional review from Library Journal that's posted here on Amazon.  And I have to strive to be impartial, because I really dislike books written in the first person.  Because that's a strictly personal dislike, I tried my hardest to put it aside and just concentrate on the book's content.  I think I succeeded, and I think I'm being fair when I say this book would only have been stronger for being in the third-person.<br /><br />Quite a bit of the time, the main character, Lady Helena, is much less interesting than the people around her.  To give Helena credit her character does grow & change during the course of the story, but I still would say that Helena's EXPERIENCES are more interesting than Helena, herself, is.  I kept wanting the POV of Ben, Helena's eventual husband; the POV of Helena's mother; etc.  I was always wanting to know more about the supporting characters, but not through the narrow window of Helena's reactions to and her thoughts about them.<br /><br />I couldn't help but recall DH Lawrence's \\"John Thomas and Lady Jane\\" while reading the description of Ben and Helena's marriage.  Ms. Hughesdon, while actually a competent and good writer, doesn't come close to DH Lawrence's depiction of the interaction (sexual and otherwise) between the lower-born man and the aristocratic woman; his grasp of the class system makes his writing seem so much more \\"true\\", or at least accurate, about relations between the classes (and the sexes) in the post-WWI England.  DH Lawrence's novel was shocking at its time of publication because of the relationship it portrayed.  It wasn't just the sexual acts it described that caused the shock - it was the relationship it portrayed between the lower-class man with the higher-class woman that also caused waves when it was published.<br /><br />With Lawrence's book in mind (a book which was actually written at the time Ms. Hughesdon is trying to depict), I felt Lady Helena's decision, given her upbringing and position as the daughter of an Earl, to marry a man with NO position (a working class sergeant from the lower ranks) was implausible.  Given the very real barriers that existed between the classes even after WWI (which bent, but did not break these barriers), Helena's marriage to Ben would not have occurred.  Or, if a relationship did occur, it wouldn't have ended with a marriage.  Even given Helena's nervous breakdown; her parents' lack of interest in her, and her poor mental state after the war, the class divide remained too strong.  The family would have closed ranks around Helena, and Ben would have been sent packing.  I didn't feel Ms. Hughesdon was on solid ground when she had Helena and Ben marry with the blessing of Helena's family.  That was the first \\"oh come on!\\" moment for me.<br /><br />Helena had been a nurse at the Front, in one of the worst wars ever waged.  I think, despite her insecurities and poor mental condition, as a British aristocrat of that era, raised to believe she was of higher value than anyone else, Helena would have had assertiveness; backbone.  But she's a weak, insecure and timid character from the beginning of thisstory almost to its very end.  At least by the end, she has finally made up her mind to stick with Ben, to really love him and bear his child.  But Helena's willy-nilly, initial thought, after her first sexual encounter with Ben, is:  \\"Let me let my body make the decision, not my mind.\\"  How typical of her weakness as a person, and how unappealing.  She keeps this attitude in force during most of the marriage, until just before giving birth and then, finally, undergoing a change of heart and mind toward Ben.<br /><br />Ms. Hughesdon couldn't seem to make up her mind just how to portray Ben.  He's a rough working-class husband who will live by his own terms - ordering Helena to eat her tea (for her own good, of course); ordering her to get dressed; or, ordering her to open her legs.  (He *actually does* order her to open her legs.)  However, he's also sympathetic to her singing career; buys a medical textbook when Helena becomes pregnant which he then reads from cover to cover.  He also reads Carlyle and Karl Marx while he's off shift from his working-class job.  It seemed that the author was trying to make Ben a combination of different men - both a salt of the earth/heroic rescuer of Helena, a man who's better than all those lousy aristocrats who screwed up and left Britain a worse place with the war - but still throws in some working-class-caveman characteristics which are no better than an old Harlequin Presents hero.  And touching on that - in one respect, Ben is just not \\"real\\" at all:  working as hard as Ben works, having to get up at 3AM every morning --could he really have made love to Helena 4-5 times per night? as Ms. Hughesdon has him do?<br /><br />I realize SONG OF SONGS is a work of fiction, but my knowledge of the social customs of the time and place won't let me see Ben and Helena as \\"realistic\\" (albeit fictional) people living during the era that the author was trying to depict.  As characters, they are false; their life together is too.

That being said, I'd say this debut novel shows promise in some ways but doesn't deliver in terms of having a consistently interesting plot and in creating original characters who act from believeable motivations.<br /><br />Some of the writing is simply laughable - so over-done.  The author's editor was lying down on the job.  For instance, there's a line in the first couple of chapters that particularly sticks in my head - the hero and heroine are eating dinner and he reaches over and \\"touched her nose with delicate inquisitiveness\\".  I admit I almost gave up on the book right there.  Not to mention the physical impossibility, let alone ridiculousness, of reaching over an ornate Victorian dining table and touching someone; let alone someone's NOSE, \\"with delicate inquisitiveness\\"... The whole line just made me laugh.  I could \\"see\\" this line if the author had used it, say, when the man was touching the woman's body, \\"with delicate inquisitiveness\\" - well, maybe I should stop right there.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br />******<br /><br />The author does show imagination in making the hero genuinely afflicted by an incurable disease that makes it impossible for him to experience sunlight.<br />******<br /><br />END OF SPOILER<br /><br />But I think that's the only original thing about the man.  I've met this tall, dark, unhappy, brawny-shouldered, lean-waisted, somewhat repressedly sensual man in other romance novels, many, many times.  Aside from his particular problem, there's nothing FRESH about him.  I did appreciate that both the hero are heroine are in their early thirties.  It's nice, for once, to read about mature people working out their romantic relationship, instead of the usual 18 year old virgin and 30 year old rakehell.<br /><br />But I just didn't feel that interested in Victoria or Byron; didn't really get pulled into their story.  I didn't feel that Victoria's past, once revealed, was especially compelling, or that her character was anything above and beyond a typical romance novel heroine (aside from her not being a virgin).  Also, it's not as if her previous experience created any sympathy for her (with me).  At the very least, the prior experience should have been something that touched or changed her in some way.  In this case, Victoria didn't even have a love affair, as such-  she admits to the hero that she had an itch that she scratched, but then her fiance died.  And she wasn't upset by that loss, or by the loss of the child that could have come from that union.  Because Victoria didn't seem to care about her losses, I didn't care either.  I could feel the author trying to make me care, but the trying didn't succeed.<br /><br />The hero, Byron, to give the author credit, was a more interesting character than Victoria, but that was because of his problem (illness) and the way he was dealing with it, and its impact on his relationship with Victoria.  At least 80% of Byron is, like Victoria, made up of somewhat typical romance-novel-hero-elements.<br /><br />And what other romance writer ever thought of ending a romance novel with the heroine's telling the hero she has her period?  (And he still suggests they make love... Bleh.)  Sure, they end up happily, but... bleh.<br /><br />I must also mention something I personally found really annoying:  all the hero's servants (he lives on an estate in Yorkshire) use the word \\"thoo\\" for \\"you\\".  This pronunciation may really be a part of Yorkshire speech patterns, but it was mighty annoying in print.  \\"Thoo must...\\"  \\"Thoo are...\\"<br /><br />As for the sensual scenes, well, to each his own, but I have to say they didn't do anything for me.  The peach crumble scene, which seems to have been a big hit with some readers, seems clumsily written (about as clumsy as actully having peach crumble in bed), and is not really sensual at all.  I could sense that the author was TRYING very hard, but she just didn't have the ability to create sensuality between these characters, and that's a necessity in a romance novel.<br /><br />2 stars for some of the imaginative and different elements created by this author: the hero's problem; the non-virgin heroine (even if she's not most successful creation), and, making the hero and the heroine over thirty.  But frankly I began to skim after the first two-thirds of this book and was bored before the end.<br /><br />Better luck with the author's sophmore effort?y to create sensuality between these characters, and that's a necessity in a romance novel.           2 stars for some of the imaginative and different elements created by this author: the hero's problem; the non-virgin heroine (even if she's not most successful creation), and, making the hero and the heroine over thirty.

Cat begins to regret having forged this type of relationship with Liam practically from the very INSTANT of beginning it.  The book would be stronger if the author had made her EVENTUALLY realize just what she was throwing away.<br /><br />Another somewhat minor quibble is that we only get Cat's POV.  The author lets us know by gentle hints that Liam is more interested in Cat than she realizes, but we don't get into his head.  I prefer stories that show both POV's.<br /><br />The plot device of having Cat thinking Liam is interested in her mother is a bit stupid, and a little yucky, actually, for my taste.  But all in all, despite my quibbles, it's actually a well-paced, OK read, so I recommend it, with these provisos.	2005-07-12
US	38889875	RCVCOCSBSOB7L	0373289936	215593203	His Secret Duchess	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Not five stars; much less worthy	While I liked the hero, Nick, the heroine Mary struck me as being a bit of a Miss Martyr, as well as not very bright.  The heroine could tell from his looks that Traywick was a gross bully, and felt uncomfortable with him at first meeting (and all the characters in the book felt this way!).  So why in heck would she end up giving him her son?  It made no sense, no matter how \\"desperate\\" she was.<br /><br />I thought the main plot, of the two lovers separated by war and misunderstandings, was sweet enough, and I appreciated when Nick rescued Mary from her situation, but in the end there was nothing memorable about the book, except for Nick's \\"disability\\", which he ended up overcoming pretty easily anyway.<br /><br />For all that, this is not a very badly written romance, and contains some redeeming plot developments, but in the end it's too unbelievable, and the heroine's consistent TSTL moments don't add to its credibility.  Just barely recommended.	2005-07-12

Except that her chaperone, Dillon Hearn, is the woman Charles once loved ten years ago when he was the last-born son of a nobleman and a poor sailor in the British Navy.  Her family prevented her from marrying him by nefarious means, and broke her heart in the process, making her determined never to marry.<br /><br />Unfortunately for such a romantic set-up (the return of the old lover), the interaction between Charles and Dillon is antiseptic.  The story is spoiled by Charles's seeming attachment to the heroine's niece until the last six pages of the book, and, by the heroine's stubborn determination not to fall in love with him again.  (One doesn't come across a heroine that stubborn too often, so I applaud her in one way, yet in this instance her stubborness was spoiling the \\"reunited and it feels good\\" potential of their romance!)<br /><br />These two characters only connect emotionally at the very end of the book, which I admit is something I hate.  That being said, someone who loves Regency romance may love this book.  I can't say it's not well written, and Dillon is a strong heroine in some ways.  (It's nice that she didn't fall into a decline when her first love was thwarted -- yet, she carries it on a bit too far once he comes back.  That's the major flaw in her character.)  All the characters here are enjoyably well-rounded ones, except Charles who remains a mystery until the very end.  But it was too frustrating that the author made me wait & wait & wait for Charles and Dillon to get together, only six pages before the end?  I felt cheated.	2005-06-21
US	38889875	R1JL6E4VK61F58	1551669277	438003724	Wicked Loving Lies	Books	3	7	10	N	N	OK, it's not "politically correct"	One thing any new reader of WICKED LOVING LIES has to accept from the get-go is that this romance novel is over 25 years old.  I first read it in the early '80's, and still have my dog-eared, taped-up copy. I liked it then, and I still do, even though I've read arguably \\"better\\" (maybe, just more \\"romantic\\"), romance novels.<br /><br />Dominic IS a brutal man, and Marisa could be certified crazy for always ending up attracted to him despite the brutality he displays toward her...  and yet, there are his brief instances of tenderness toward Marisa --at the chateau in France when they are first married-- then again, later in the story, in Louisiana when Dominic & Marisa meet up again, and finally when he rescues her from the slave trader (Slave trader you ask? -- yes, the plot really does thicken!), when Dominic puts his future and all his plans at risk, in order to save Marisa.  I admit it's very hard to really LIKE Dominic, until the last few chapters of the story when he finally owns up to his feelings for Marisa.  But at least there are these brief interludes, and his decision to rescue Marisa when she's in danger, to give me a hint of something better in Dominic's nature.<br /><br />Marisa, to give her credit, is a heroine along the lines of 'Ginny' from 'Sweet Savage Love'.  She suffers abuse from many people (not just Dominic, by the way) but NEVER gives up or gives in.  She is one stubborn, feisty, back-talking woman.  In fact, Marisa's stubborness, and refusal to be put down by any man or any situation, is probably what saves this book (and Sweet Savage Love) from being a subpar potboiler, a nasty alpha-male w/abused heroine, overly-typical-1980's historical romance.  I could stand to encounter more heroines with Marisa's stubborness and willpower in my romance reading than some of the beautiful but brain-dead heroines I've encountered.<br /><br />I still re-read this book every other year or so.  By no means are Wicked Loving Lies, or Sweet Savage Love, perfect \\"romance\\" novels.  Yet these stories are definitely readable despite the lack of \\"PC\\" and tender interludes.  At the very least, there's life, color and action in these stories and in these characters, and that's not so easily dismissed.  In fact, these stories are more readable to me than the books Rosemary Rogers is writing today.ls.  Yet these stories are definitely readable despite the lack of \\"PC\\" and tender interludes.

The author really had the gift of making every character, not just Alessandra, come alive.  I certainly loved the setting and the time period.  I loved the fact that even though this is written in the first person, the reader gets to know most of these characters in-depth (Alessandra's mother, for example).  No one character is set in one mold; they changed and surprised me at times.<br /><br />I'm not comparing it to Tracy Chevalier's work (I can't, since I've only read Fallen Angels anyway); or go on about neo-feminist-lit, or kvetch about the reunion between Alessandra and her painter-lover, or whatever it was about this novel that other reviewers seem to have a problem with.  I found THE BIRTH OF VENUS to be a very good historical novel with a dash of romance, period.	2005-06-09

Every other character in the book is believable as a fully developed, \\"real\\" person; humanly flawed, but the heroine is all shining goodness and light.<br /><br />The heroine is born rich, a Princess of the royal Hapsburg court, no less, but, after undergoing a reversal of fortune, she's at the mercy of the real (post-WWI) world.  The previously fabulously wealthy and royally-born heroine (who in reality would have suckled pride with her mother's milk) meekly allows people to treat her like a servant and talk down to her.  When the Princess/heroine was letting herself be ordered around 24-7 by the members of the opera company; was living in poverty and never allowed a day off; was missing meals without complaint... the story seemed to have no point other than portraying how creepily self-deprecating a woman could let herself become.  Blah.  There's enough of that around in real life without its being celebrated in works of fiction.<br /><br />OK, I'm being harsh.  I know it's supposed to be the Cinderella story, but in the end the heroine was just plain annoying because she never, ever stood up for herself, and had to be rescued.  I guess I was not in the mood to be enchanted by an unbelievable doormat of a heroine, even with a happy-ever-after tacked on.	2005-06-06

A love story set in postwar WWII Germany, between an American soldier and a German girl - what could be more challenging, more conflicting, and more potentially heartbreaking?  Postwar occupied Germany -- what a setting for a really superb story of love that overcomes all obstacles.<br /><br />Bah.  Not this novel.  This book is SUPPOSEDLY set in postwar Germany, but it's more like Fairyland.  Every character here is an absolute stereotype.  They have no life to them; they just lay there on the page, mouthing the author's apologias.  The heroine, Lisa's, parents don't try to stop her from forming a connection with the American soldier, they welcome it, after about two hesitations.  No one in charge of the American army of occupation reproaches or penalizes the hero, Andy, for his immediate and obvious affair with this young German girl.  This book is actually an insult to anyone who really went through the heartache, and extremely difficult experience mentally AND emotionally, of loving a person from the \\"enemy camp\\".  The author's portrayal of the American army is an insult to American soldiers who occupied Germany after WWII.  It's so unrealistic!  Lisa is able to follow Andy from posting to posting, getting jobs whenever she wants, with absolutely no problem, no red tape!  And when **(SPOILER)<br /><br />Andy is killed, there's already someone waiting in the wings, all ready to step into his shoes, in the character of Red, the best friend of Andy who oh-so-coincidentally loves Lisa too.<br /><br />(END OF SPOILER)**<br /><br />The author's POV about the American occupation of Germany and the German reaction to it, and about what Germans \\"really\\" thought about Hitler, is obviously re-filtered through the blame-my-behavior-on-everyone-else, current philosophy.  Per the heroine's, Lisa's, statement, only 1 million Germans were registered Nazis out of 70 million Germans, but the rest of them were all good, pure, downtrodden people who wanted peace as much as everyone else...  This is ridiculous.  If you use this fictional 17-year-old's reasoning, then how the heck did Hitler stay in power?  Answer:  most of the German people (not just 1 million registered Nazis) WANTED him in power.  Otherwise there would have been more plots to remove him from power.  Hell, he probably would not have achieved his power in the first place.  He was able to take power and hold power after 1933 not just because of political machinations; the Reichstag fire, etc., but due to the German people's admiration for his leadership.<br /><br />As for the author's writing ability - it's too florid; it's adolescent, and the romance quotient (along with the realism quotient) is absolutely silly.<br /><br />Ugh.  This was an extremely disappointing novel; I really disliked it and cannot recommend it.pure, downtrodden people who wanted peace as much as everyone else...  This is ridiculous.

I can't believe I haven't submitted a review of this novel long before this time, as I've owned and loved this book for years.<br /><br />A BED OF SPICES has all the elements I love in a romance novel: a forbidden love story, this time between the Christian heroine, Rica and the Jewish hero, Solomon (very rare to find a Jewish hero); well-drawn supporting characters; a medieval setting (Germany, 1348-1349 in the time of the Black Plague) and a fabulous blend of historical fact with romantic fiction.  Although the story moves slowly, it's really worth your while.  You will remember Rica and Solomon's story.  If you love historical romance novels, you owe it to yourself to read this book.  I often turn back to this novel to refresh myself as to what a historical romance OUGHT to be - creative, imaginative and tender.	2005-05-19

This is an impressive romance novel with all the right ingredients: a colorful setting [to say the least!]; fully drawn supporting characters; intelligent & resourceful heroine; dark & tormented, yet sympathetic hero.  The novel does drag just a bit in the center, and suffers a bit from typical romance-novel cliches at that section (the heroine being in the possession of the hero at his mountain stronghold), but quickly picks up again when the heroine is returned to Rangoon and the hero is on trial for murder.  While not a \\"tender\\" romance, the author is very good at letting you know a character's pain and conflict.  This was a real page turner, and a very good read.	2005-05-17

First of all, I did not buy the reason that had Nicholas being the tormented dark hero that he was.  It was very lame and confused.  I *think* what the author wanted to say, is that Nicholas's father didn't love him -- or at least, Nicholas *thought* his father didn't love him, and when his older brother died and Nicholas was all that was left, his father regretted that and let Nicholas know it.  So, this was Nicholas's excuse to become a womanizing rakehell bent on self-destruction.<br /><br />Secondly, I couldn't come to terms with Nicholas refusing to help Ghislaine's family when they were threatened by the oncoming French Revolution.  He really loved her at that time, although she was only 15.  But Nicholas gets a letter telling him his father's dead, so he uses THAT as an excuse to become all hard & cold, and tells Ghislaine's father he won't take her out of the country?  Huh?  This is the love of your life - your first love no less - the one person who makes you feel all tender & happy - and you're going to go haywire and not help her or her family, because you got a letter telling you your father's dead, and suddenly you feel unlovable?<br /><br />More reasonably, I could see Nicholas feeling unlovable at age 35 after years of being a skanky rake, but at age 22, Nicholas should have been more mallable and willing to believe in love.  But of course, if he had helped Gilly's family, there would no further story, because Gilly wouldn't have had anything to hate him for!<br /><br />And that brings me to my third point:  (SPOILERS) How can you ever love someone who left you in a very dangerous situtation that ultimately destroyed your family?  Nicholas's failure to come to their aid brings utter destruction and Gilly's parents are killed.  And she's left to sell herself on the streets of Paris.  Excuse me, but all that would DEFINITELY come between me and whatever uncontrollable attraction I felt for a man.  Even a mere fictional character should have more sense.  (END SPOILERS)<br /><br />I also thought the subplot between Ellen & Tony was just a chore to read, not a bore necessarily, but a chore.  If one more person or happenstance interrupted their potential lovemaking, I was going to SCREAM bloody murder.  I hate it when authors play around that way -- bringing their characters to the brink, and then having someone walk in on them, or having a cat knock over a dish; over and over.  It doesn't increase the dramatic or sensual tension - it just gets old, FAST, and annoying.  Despite the flimsy reasons given for the choices they made, Gilly and Nicholas were by far a more interesting couple than Ellen and Tony.  I suppose the author wanted a 'light' sub-story to counterbalance the 'dark' romance of Gilly and Nicholas but Ellen and Tony are two average characters; just blah.  Their ho-hum romance never really took off.<br /><br />The constantly changing settings gave me a headache.  The characters are whipped from England to Scotland to Holland to Venice to France, (and flashbacks to Gilly's youth in France as well).  (SPOILER ALERT) When Nicholas had the battle with the man who raped Gilly (entirely due to Nicholas' failing to rescue her, I could not forget) it was so melodramatic.  And then he ends up killing the guy who sold her to the madam. (END OF SPOILER)<br /><br />I guess the author was trying to redeem Nicholas in the heroine's eyes - well, it worked for the Gilly, more fool her, but just didn't work for me.<br /><br />2 stars for the somewhat intriguing heroine with a vengeful backbone (I much preferred Gilly when she wanted to poison Nicholas) but, the unbelieveable motivations of the main characters; weak secondary characters, and really melodramatic actions in the last few chapters soured this story.whatever uncontrollable attraction I felt for a man.

I have to agree with the professional reviewer who used the word, \\"maddening\\" to describe the writing here.

The heroine redeems herself from this flaw, however, by constantly confronting the hero with his stubborn refusal to reconcile with  his estranged daughter.<br /><br />The plot moves along sensibly, with good character growth and interactions.  The plot is also believable (a pleasant change in a Harlequin, for me) and only becomes melodramaticly flawed toward the end, with leering criminals shooting the hero; kidnapping the hero's pregnant daughter; threatening the heroine, and the daughter giving birth in a mountain cave.  But what's gone on before the last couple chapters is pretty good, so I will grant the book 3 stars.  On the whole, it's a VG read (until those last few chapters) and worth a couple hours of your time, although it doesn't make keeper status with me.  I think the best recommendation I can give is that I would read more work by this author.	2005-05-03

The first section of this book was really good; I was anticipating a superb reading experience.  Initially, Ms. Donnelly captured the feel of lower-class, Victorian London during the time of Jack the Ripper, and her characters were exciting, fully-realized human beings, not just fictional standbys.<br /><br />Then came part 2...right after the heroine, Fiona's, mother, got killed by Jack the Ripper and Fiona was being pursued by a brute who had her father murdered...and her brother Charlie apparently gets murdered too... and Fiona had to escape to New York, with the convenient help of a rich art dealer on the ship out of Southhampton.  And then, Fiona becomes the girlfriend of a millionaire, while bemoaning the fact that she can never feel for this man what she felt for her true love, Joe Bristow -- oh, brother the melodrama, pathos, and unreality came on faster than lightning and thicker than molasses.  And somehow a really, really well-written beginning involving the hardworking underbelly of Victorian London deteriorated into a melodramatic revenge plot only worthy of those hoary old Victorian vaudeville shows.<br /><br />The second part of \\"The Tea Rose\\" was really heartbreaking to me, because the first part opened so strongly.  I found myself skimming halfway through the second part, unable to sustain interest, and only really finished the book with a half-hearted interest in order to find out if Joe and Fiona would reconcile their lifelong romance, because I'm a sucker for a good love story (which this was, but only up a point).  Fiona became an unreal character, but Joe maintained at least one foot in reality.<br /><br />Three stars for the first section, which is deservedly well written; NO stars for the second section which decends into the worst sort of pathetic unbelieveable nonsense.	2005-04-29

I can't believe the author who wrote \\"My Beloved\\" wrote this book.  \\"My Beloved\\" is a story of tenderness...this is a story of brutality; described in overwhelming detail.  WHY did Ms. Ranney think she had to describe every single lurid detail of the sexual attacks that happen to Judith?  Such multiple descriptions have no place in a romance novel - a single descriptive instance of one of the rapes endured by the heroine would have been MORE than enough, if the author had to include ANY.<br /><br />I also could not believe that any woman who had endured the following could have been made \\"happy\\" by the end of this story:<br /><br />1.  Father ignores, and/or criticizes, and/or slaps heroine around for her WHOLE life, never doing one single thing for her except marrying her off three (3) times without thinking about what kind of men he's giving her to;<br /><br />2.  Mother is a downtrodden, self-centered weakling, who shows heroine no special affection, OR makes any attempt to protect her;<br /><br />3.  Sisters who appear to be of no greater worth than the mother, who like their mother don't give a darn about the heroine either, except to be bitchy to her during their one & only appearance in the story;<br /><br />4.  Multiple, sadistic rapes of the heroine described in graphic detail committed by heroine's 2nd husband, AND his brother, PLUS that husband's friends, on occasion.<br /><br />The author poured the horror onto this woman's life.  I mean, we're supposed to believe that this woman can overcome a lifetime's lack of love & care from anyone, AND, abnormal sexual relations with sadists, AND accomplish this miracle over the course of a mere three months with the hero, thus becoming a normal, happy, sexually well-adjusted person? all thanks to the hero?  I mean, it would take years & years of therapy for a real-life woman to overcome Judith's liabilities!  I know it's only a novel, but, come on!<br /><br />And frankly, I have my doubts about the hero too.  He actually had the nerve to think -- briefly, it's true, but he DID think it -- that the heroine was having a tryst with her sadistic brother-in-law when in fact, she was obviously trying to run AWAY from they man, and was fighting with him on the ground.  All well & good to make the hero a god in appearance (& in the bedroom) but, let's give him a brain, too, Ms. Ranney.<br /><br />I really disliked this book!

It's a fairly standard, teenage-romance/reunion-later-w/secret-sick-child story. There's nothing special about the plot.  Oh, and the heroine's never had decent sex with anyone but the hero; she now wears sack dresses, and her life was a misery both before him and after him, but never \\"during\\" him.  So sterotypical. The story has its sweet moments, but it doesn't add up to anything greater than mind candy.<br /><br />The particular feature of this book that annoyed me most was the weak/wimp heroine, because I've been reading this same heroine's character over & over in various semi-contemporary romance novels.  I'm starting to think it's impossible for romance authors to write a female heroine who's as GOOD as the male hero, an EQUAL to him, as a fully-rounded character, not just good LOOKING.<br /><br />Not all women are poor weak things skulking through life in gray shapeless dresses, seemingly waiting for a \\"hero\\" to rescue them!  In real life, a woman like this, in her unfashionable hairdo and grey sack dress, wouldn't get a second glance from the hero, even with a past romance in their history.

US	38889875	R1WTFYN67L7OFW	0061012890	605594243	Heart of Deception	Books	3	7	8	N	Y	This book came highly recommend -- BUT	But, I was frankly very disappointed in it.  Several friends & fellow romance readers told me it simply was a MUST READ!, and certainly the reviews on this page bear this book out as being a favorite among romance readers.  I really hate to be the one dissenting voice, but I did not find this book to be that compelling.<br /><br />I was firstly disappointed in the fact that there's an instant physical attraction between Rafe & Vivian.  For such a strong & independent woman, she's practically drooling over him from the instant she meets him.  He's getting that special feeling in his pants from the instant he meets her, too.  Sheesh!  I thought he was keen to solve his friend's murder & his family's disgrace?  From the minute he meets Vivian, Rafe TELLS himself he \\"shouldn't feel this\\" for her, but telling himself that doesn't stop him from HAVING those feelings...and vice-versa for Vivian. How lame.  Couldn't she have shown more independence?  Couldn't he?  Instead of being struck with lust by her, couldn't he have felt stronger disgust for her line of work, or her lack of feminine hoity-toity graces, or something??  Shouldn't an experienced criminal like Vivian been even more suspicious of the newcomer, less welcoming?<br /><br />And I have to admit I didn't find anything too compelling about the mystery of the identities of Topaz, Silver, et al., or who was behind the plot to put Mary Queen of Scots on the throne in place of Elizabeth I.  This kind of ties into my feeling that there was no tension to this story; I was able to put it down & pick up it later (much later) with no problem.  It certainly wasn't a \\"must read!\\" plot for me.<br /><br />Yeah, the sexy scenes were sexy, but again, a feeling of \\"haven't I read this before?\\" kept cropping up...Frankly, if Emma Holly had written this book, it would have been much better.  At least she would have given the (...) Nick and Rosy's story a much needed boost.  (Emma Holly is the only female writer I know of, who's capable of writing about two men in love, and making it sexy.)<br /><br />As it is, it was hard to believe Nick Swift was capable of anything decisive, much less being in charge of a band of thieves in a deadly territory of Elizabethan London.  And I could just tell that Rosy, his lover, was going to turn on him at some point in the story -- and golly gee! I was right.<br />There was just something so -- I don't want to say it, it's really too strong a word, but I guess I have to -- homophobic, about making the (...) character die, and having his lover be the killer.  It just seemed so weak of the author, to fall into this easy-way-out-end of their story, in favor of jumping forward with the saga of  Vivian & Rafe.<br /><br />I'm not happy about how much I didn't enjoy this book -- when a book comes highly recommended, I really expect it to be something special.  Sorry, my friends, this book wasn't.ut two men in love, and making it sexy.)

The author has him  wonder if her breasts are \\"as soft as they looked\\".  Excuse me?  The hero's a medicine man; SHE's injured; she's been horribly maimed by a rapist, and he's wondering if her injured breasts are SOFT?<br /><br />That REALLY threw me.<br /><br />This book is very violent.  Most of the men in this story, aside from Black Wolf (and frankly, given his thoughts about the pain-ridden, unconscious heroine, I wondered about him too) are one-dimensional animals; really, animals.  The Lakota people, on the other hand, are practically saints.  Except for the jealous Lakota maiden who can't stand it when the white heroine becomes the beloved of the hero.<br /><br />Yet still, there is something very readable about the book.  I can (almost) understand why some readers might give it five stars, even if I can't.  There are some genuinely well-written parts, such as the heroine's adoption into the Lakota; retrieving her health and self-respect, and her happy life with Wolf.  But overall, the book is weakened by its one-dimensional supporting characters, and its forays in what I'd call subpar, just plain lazy romance writing into what could have been a very sweetly romantic, realistic tale.	2005-04-20

The characterizations are alive; these could be living people, and their story is a heartbreaking one.  The only complaint I have with the novel is the fact that it jumps from late December 1941, directly to May 1942 -- Uh, how did Anna, Andrei and Kolya survive during the other three & one-half months of winter?  It was too abrupt a break in the flow of the work.  Also, I personally thought the weakest part of the book was all that concerned Anna's romance with Andrei. I didn't feel the chemistry of the romance; I actually wanted more and more about how the family survived during the siege.<br /><br />Still, everything else about the book is SO powerful, (the characters of Anna's dead mother; her father and Maria Petrovna his mistress, in particular) I gladly give it four stars and recommend it highly.	2005-04-19

So I broke my sacred rule!<br /><br />Anyway -- This one is not as terrible as the last two, thank goodness.  There's plenty of Harlequin-romance stereotypical behavior and characters...(don't Englishmen ever want to protest about being portrayed as wimpy and sexually clueless in these Harlequin romances?)  Yet, there's a slightly deeper subtext  Ms. James gives these characters which makes the story enjoyable and a good read.<br /><br />Portia, the heroine, is a blonde, fragile English flower who's never experienced good sex (characteristics typical of a Harlequin heroine) and Diego, the obligatory Latin multi-millionaire who's the answer to a maiden's prayer (also typical of the Harlequin-formula hero) have a somewhat deeper layer than the superficial gloss.  She's been honestly damaged by her only sexual experience with a clumsy English boyfriend into thinking of herself as frigid, avoiding any men who could possibly break that belief; he's been damaged by a childhood in the slums, losing his parents and clawing his way to the top...Well, it sounds corny, and it probably is, but Ms. James makes it work.<br /><br />I still think Ms. James is a better writer than the Harlequin formula is allowing her to be, so I awarded one star for that.  I'm hoping she'll write something really memorable, outside of that box, someday.	2005-04-13

The hero is attractively presented, but he's weakened by his interaction with this heroine.  The author set the story in 1780's PA and frontier KY, yet basically it brought nothing realistic of the time period into the plot, except for the heroine's fears of an Indian attack.  However, there's more menace toward the heroine from an insane Englishman than from any Indian.  I cannot recommend this book.	2005-04-12

Having recently read & enjoyed \\"A Rogue in Texas\\" I looked forward to sampling Ms. Heath's latest novel, thinking it would be as good as that one -- WRONG.<br /><br />What didn't I like about it?  I could not believe that the author of \\"Rogue\\", was the same author who wrote this book!  It's like she morphed into Julianne MacLean, and I do NOT mean that as a compliment.  This book is a MAJOR come down from the talent Ms. Heath has displayed in prior work.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:  Spoiler Alert:<br />I could barely maintain my interest in the plot, and ended up skimming before the end. I can't help but be particularly annoyed at the heroine's insistence that she's barren.  In every chapter, she's reminding us she can't have a child.  It was like a big hint-hint-hint that she'd end up with a child eventually, thanks to the hero's potent \\"seed\\". (And in this case, he's VERY potent -- she ends up with 5 children, for Pete's sake.)<br /><br />(End of spoiler)<br />I also can't stand a novel that pays lip service to historical mores, values and behavior (in this case, of 19th century, aristocratic England) while filtering these through 21st century behavior.  It's incredibly jarring to encounter 21st-century behaviors & beliefs in a 19th-century setting.<br /><br />And note to Ms. Heath:  I believe cravats went out after the Regency period.<br /><br />While there is nothing particularly original or memorable about this novel, except that it stank up the room, I give it two stars for the fact that the H/H constantly talked with each other about their problems; there were no stupid misunderstandings; and the love scenes weren't rushed into (but for all her efforts, the author left this reader cold in that respect).  The hero is also very sweet, but this actually worked against a higher rating from me--there should be some gray, a hero can't be all white or all black.  In this case, he's all white & nice, but dull.<br /><br />Avoid this novel if you've enjoyed Ms. Heath's Western romances.  She should definitely go back to these, as aristocratic British society settings do not suit her at all.ack to these, as aristocratic British society settings do not suit her at all.	2005-04-06

This book has mature, well-rounded characters and a plot that doesn't strain belief too much; a real bonus.  I also enjoyed that the heroine's three children are realistically portrayed, and are not sugary-sweet little angels who are made to talk in a more mature way than their actual age.  So many romance authors make the mistake of portraying children as little gods who have the knowledge of adults & are just too good to be true.<br /><br />I might have sacrificed a love scene or two in favor of some deepening of the issues between the English gentleman, Grayson (the hero) and his father; I might have preferred to see what it finally was that drove his father to send Grayson to America, but this is a minor quibble, all other factors considered.<br /><br />I've been reading some pretty bad romances lately, so this novel was like a breath of fresh air.  I recommend it to all those readers who'd like a change from Regency England or medievals.  Take it from someone whose first choice generally is not Western-themed historical romances -- I think this one will pleasantly surprise you.	2005-04-04

The story is SO illogical -- the characterizations so inane -- the whole plot SO unbelievably bad, melodramatic and without sense, HOW can anyone think this book was worthy of the four or five star ratings it has received here??<br /><br />First of all, Gavin wasn't given even a minimal facial wound, just to make it difficult for his family to recognize him???<br /><br />And as another example--just one more example of the illogical nature of this story--Gavin has a reasonably affectionate, normal relationship with his brother Angus.  We are told that they enlisted together, we are shown that they are friendly, even protective of each other in the trenches.  Yet, Gavin is instantly, and I do mean instantly, ready to believe that his brother wanted him dead at the Front, and in fact, abandoned him to die.  And even later on, when someone he trusts  points out to Gavin how RIDICULOUS it is that he could think such a thing of his brother--HE STILL THINKS IT, and is STILL determined to \\"revenge\\" himself on Angus!  What a dope!<br /><br />The back-cover blurb and the reviews try to play this up as a \\"revenge\\" story; i.e. Gavin seeks revenge on his brother for leaving him to \\"die\\"--yet, Gavin, from the instant he realizes no one knows he's alive, finds excuse after excuse after excuse, NOT to contact his family, and lets 14 (count em, 14) years go by before he attempts to seek out the woman who cared for & hid him  after he escapes from a POW camp in Germany.<br /><br />Gavin is more than willing to give up his inheritance, his title and his family's coal mining business, in order to get involved in his American sponsor's china-making business.  Please, a British milord, born & bred to \\"duty\\", would NEVER give up his heritage!<br /><br />And the way the character of Flora was presented!  Don't get me started!  She could \\"sense\\" everything, except her own stupidity.  Gavin supposedly \\"loves\\" Flora like he loves no other woman, yet he doesn't find it difficult to sleep with his German girlfriend; his best friend's mother, or his lesbian wife & HER girlfriend.  Bleh.<br /><br />Through the story, characters are raised up, dropped down & killed off to suit the author's purpose; the author shows no grasp of time or any  feeling for these characters, or interest in making them anything NEAR realistic.  In particular, Angus & Flora are left dangling in mid-story for 14 years before we see anything of them again!<br /><br />The discerning romance reader should avoid this book at all costs.

Even for shallow Harlequins, her books have been ULTRA shallow, and stereotypical.  In regard to this book:  there's just nothing new or fresh about this story.  The plot here basically is:  a woman who's never had a great sexual relationship goes to Greece & finds one.<br /><br />(By the way - why do Harlequin heroines have to go to Greece, or Tuscany, or Spain to experience great sex, because in Harlequin-world, only gorgeous rich men=great sexual partners, and same apparently don't exist in the U.S. or in England?  The rejected boyfriend/husband is generally English, & already married--to his mother.  Frankly, if I were an American male or an Englishman, I'd be kind of angry about these characterizations!)<br /><br />The hero here is alpha-male with a capital A, but the heroine kinda likes that, despite the protestations of modern-day feminism (the type of heroine who fights her attraction to the hero ...juuuuusst...enough...to get him thinking \\"she's different than all the rest\\"; the rest being the zillion other sexual partners in his past.  Bleh.<br /><br />And of course, in typical Harlequin fashion, HE turns out to be worth billions.  If, as Harlequin writers would have us believe, there are so many rich guys masquerading as poor ones, I want to know why I'm not meeting these hidden billionaires on MY vacations?<br /><br />And, hey, wasn't THAT secret billionaire plot twist done like, 45 years ago, with the Yves Montand/Marilyn Monroe movie \\"Let's Make Love\\"?

There is nothing particularly original about the plot or the characters, and the Big Misunderstanding that keeps the Hero & Heroine apart for most of the story is especially dumb.<br /><br />The hero thinks the heroine has decided to be a loose woman and that she's sleeping with his cousin; the heroine thinks the hero has deeper feelings than she imagined for his fiancee-of-convenience, who happens to be HER cousin.  And, although BOTH beliefs are proven false DURING the story (well before the end), neither character let themselves realize/acknowledge that what they believed about the other isn't true.<br /><br />Then, 1/3 toward the end, the story evolves into the VERY overused, \\"I-won't-love-him/her-until-he/she-says-I-love-you\\" formula.<br /><br />I had enjoyed the author's last book, \\"The Unexpected Bride\\", so I really had high hopes for this work.  It was doubly disappointing to read this because her last book added quite a bit of freshness to the typicial Regency romance formula.  This one definitely does not.<br /><br />However, I award two stars for the sensual scenes, which are very sensual if you care about that type of thing, and for the fact that the book does move along, and is not exactly boring;  it's just unoriginal, and aside from the sensual scenes, somewhat bland, silly really.  Very disappointing step backwards, in my opinion, from this author.	2005-03-28

This story is exceedingly silly - BUT, it might have been a good read, if only the heroine hadn't given up her house, her job and her spine, just to marry the man who fathered her biological daughter. (She's got HIS biological child, due to a mix-up in the IVF clinic.)  I could have accepted the marriage of convenience, so that they can each be close to their biological child (and there's the convenient fact that they are both madly attracted to each other).  But the spineless and helpless heroine who dumps everything to do what the hero tells her, really annoyed me.  The hero is not much to write home about either - he's a stiff, and too controlling, taking over the heroine too much (but then, she allows it.)<br /><br />If the author had only written stronger, more attractive characters, and given the reader a more reasonable give-n-take between them, this would have been a good quick romantic read.  As it is, it's pretty poor.	2005-03-22

For a Romeo/Juliet-style-romance, and taking place in a very tumultuous historical time period, it just didn't have that sweep, that depth, that a lifelong love story should have.  I was also a little put off by the author's horrible name choices for some of her characters. She used very modern names for 15th century England, for one; for another, the names she chose were horrible!  \\"Sloan\\" and \\"Gage\\" for the heroine's two sons, yeech!  And I don't think the names Dylan and Cameron were in use during that time, either. (Sorry, but it's a pet peeve of mine when an author uses a really modern name in a really ancient time!)<br /><br />We hear that the hero suffered as an exile from England during the Wars of the Roses, but it's a major flaw that we don't really learn what those sufferings were.  He comes back to England more mature; hardened, but we don't see how that came about.  We also don't learn how he meets and marries his wife...he just comes home married. On the other hand, we learn all about the heroine's marriage(s), how they came about, and her day to day life, so there's an imbalance there.  Also, the ending is somewhat abrupt.<br /><br />Still, that's not to say that this isn't a pretty good romance novel...just not especially memorable.  There's a nice flow to the writing, and the historical research is accurate (except for the terrible name choices, which is an entirely personal gripe).  The plot becomes deeper and basically better as it goes along (although the heroine's second husband goes from being a somewhat blah nice guy to a lecherous wife-beating bully, which was a bit of a shock).  All in all, I recommend the book, but look for it in your local library instead of purchasing it.it.	2005-03-21

This is a great story, a historical romance of the best kind (just the right blend of history and romance).  The plot grabs you & holds you -- the Spanish Inquisition and the machinations of Tomas Torquemada, tearing apart two lovers, Maria and Rafael, who go through such horrible trials before they...well, I'll let you find out.<br /><br />The best part of this novel is that it's even more than a love story.  It really brings history alive:  the Spanish Inquisition, a heartbreaking era when Christianity was used & abused.  Even Christopher Columbus is a character in this novel, and he's portrayed in an utterly realistic way.  No stock figures here, just honestly written, conflicted characters in a story that doesn't let up until the last page.  This is what a historical novel, not just a historical \\"Romance\\" novel, ought to be.	2005-03-16

Judith French is a very enjoyable writer, I can always find something to like about her books, but, in FIREHAWK'S BRIDE, her heroine leaves MUCH to be desired.  Kate fights her feelings for Fire Hawk *every* step of the way through the story, almost until the end of the book! Even after they finally make love, she's still fighting her feelings for him and saying she won't go with him to the Cherokee people!  This romance novel is a prime example of the kind where the author makes the mistake of making a hero far, far more attractive and endearing than a very undeserving heroine.  It's incredibly annoying to \\"hear\\" Kate resist her natural feelings for Hawk, because he's far more worthy of being loved than any member of her family, or her rotten fiance.  And, by the by, Kate illogically continues to have fond feelings for her parents, ALTHOUGH her parents betroth her to a well-known womanizer (who ends up sleeping with her sister, no less), and Kate still has fondness for that sister, who has been nothing but miserably selfish towards Kate for her whole life - aside from the cheating with Kate's fiance.<br /><br />All of Kate's prejudices and hesitations may have been \\"true to life\\" for a 17th century girl...but in practice, in this novel, they ruined the whole flow.  When someone as wonderful as the hero is expressing his love for the heroine, you don't want her to respond with cowardly shrinking from the fact that he's Native American, and constantly thinking/saying they just \\"can't\\" be together; that it's \\"wrong\\" for her to feel the way she does.  Especially when all the white people surrounding this girl have no redeeming features whatsoever!  I mean, she's going to stick to THESE people, instead of Hawk, who's been nothing but good, gentle and loving to her?  Kate's feelings just spoilt the love story and weakened her character considerably.<br /><br />Hawk is a marvelous hero; strong, smart, tender - The author outdid herself in creating him.  I can't say enough good about HIM.  It's just a shame he's stuck with this narrow-minded, hesitant, non-courageous heroine.  She spoilt the whole story for me.good about HIM.

The author tries to justify his seduction of the heroine by letting her have a resemblance to his dead fiancee, Leonora, the only woman Juan ever loved.  But this is only mentioned twice, in passing.  If the resemblance to the dead fiancee had been made more of, or if Georgiana (the heroine) had been a bit older (and less controlled by the hero), I might have given this romance 4 stars.<br /><br />The first few chapters of the book are fairly strong & interesting, but then it all just falls apart when Georgiana (spoiler alert) becomes pregnant, & Juan tells her he would STILL enter into his planned marriage of convenience, despite his love for Georgiana.  The ending is a very abrupt HEA which does not ring true in any way, shape or form.  While most of the action takes place in Madrid, the final chapter takes place in Tuscany.  This is just to bring in another beautiful setting, I guess, since there's no real point to the heroine's being there except that she wanted to get away from it all and find herself again...or some such drivel.  The real disappointment in this book is that the hero steadily becomes less & less heroic (downright predatory, actually), and the heroine is just too young for him.  But 2 stars for a couple of interesting first chapters.	2005-03-07

(I think there is also a ghostwriter involved.)  Also, the initial leap from present to past is somewhat awkward in execution (the first chapter begins like a memoir in the first-person, then proceeds into a novel, occasionally returning to the first-person.)<br /><br />There were parts of this book that were better than others, particularly when the action was restrained to the characters of Nikolai & Fanny (where the writing really came alive), but then, there were sections that dragged a bit (for me, the sections written in the first-person).<br /><br />However, the story grew on me, and it always held my interest.  I think 3 stars is a fair rating as I don't think I'd want to read this one again, which is my criteria for a 4 or 5 star read.	2005-03-07

I wasn't bored by it; I kept wanting to read it, but, overall, there was just something lacking - some depth of feeling?  Some lack in the characterizations?  I never really got caught up in the love story, although the author could keep the plot moving, so I remained interested in finding out what happened.  As the story went on, I liked the hero more, and liked the heroine -- much less!  She didn't always seem worthy of the hero.  For instance, she kept bringing up that she was a Catholic, and thus, feeling that she was unable to leave her totally awful husband and live with the hero as his Indian wife.  Well, OK, I get that it's the time period, but the author still left that choice incomprehensible to the reader, because even a really religious woman could, I hope, leave a husband (both emotionally and physically) who had no respect for her; hit her, never slept with her, and treated her little brother as a whipping boy!  So I just gradually found myself losing respect for the heroine the longer she stayed with her husband, and used her faith as a reason not to leave.<br /><br />I can still recommend the book, just about, but from reading some of the reviews here, other people appreciated the story more than I did.  I can say, though, that it was one of the better Native American/white woman plots I've read (most of these are pretty silly & pretty bad).  I think 3 stars is a fair rating.  It's OK, but it's not a spectacular love story.	2005-02-28

Mr. Barham does an excellent job in uncovering the brutality (it's not too strong a word) of the \\"establishment\\" when it came to granting the soldiers' disability pensions.  There was no government assistance available to the in-home caregivers, and the mentality of the physicians and medical personnel of the time was extremely severe, and limited.  Basically, severely shell-shocked soliders had no chance of recovery, given the limited medical understanding of the condition.<br /><br />This is an important book.  I could wish the writing was just a little looser; the author obviously has sympathy with the subject matter, and the detailed research can't be faulted, but there is something dry about the presentation.  I still strongly recommend the book, and I think it can be useful and interesting to both the WWI \\"buff\\" and anyone interested in mental health topics.	2005-02-25
US	38889875	R3N2L6WQFFS3XD	0061031127	177141418	The Bronze Horseman	Books	5	56	68	N	N	What a story!  (Even with its flaws!)	How can I not give a novel that kept me up until 3:30 a.m. (and not later than that only because I finally fell asleep over the book) five stars?  [And started me reading it again by 9:00 next day?]<br /><br />It's not a perfect novel.  I could wish that the author had developed the pathos of Dasha's situation more: in love with Alexander, and never realizing that he actually loved her sister, until the last days of her life.  The reader's only given tiny hints of the reasons why Tania loves her sister enough to sacrifice her love for Alexander to her; aside from these hints, Dasha comes across as a selfish and empty character.  Also, I never believed that Dasha really \\"loved\\" Alexander; from the first instant, it simply seemed liked she had an infatuation that would ultimately pass if he'd only stopped seeing her altogether!<br /><br />The emotional flatness of most of the people around Tatiana & Alexander makes a reader work at filling in their backstories.  For instance, Tania's mother makes a brief mention of Dasha's reaction to Tania's and her twin brother's birth:  Dasha says that the parents could keep the boy (who, indeed, they favor) but that Tania was Dasha's baby.  From that hint, a reader has to imagine a whole backstory of Dasha's protectiveness & love of Tania; a background which we are just not given.  If this little hint had been explored, then Tania's sacrifice (concealing her love for Alexander, and tolerating his relationship with Dasha) would make that much more sense.  As it is, the reader is frustrated by it, because the Dasha depicted here is just not worth that kind of sacrifice.<br /><br />Yet, the beauty of the book is -- while one is wishing for fully-fleshed characterizations of Dasha; Pasha the only son (who just disappears from the story), and Tania's parents; all which would have enriched the book considerably -- the love story between Tatania & Alexander is so strong, and the amazing secret that twists Alexander's life is so compelling, you ultimately forgive all that isn't there and relish their love, which just gets stronger & stronger as the story proceeds.<br /><br />The chapters on the Leningrad siege; Tania's reunion with Alexander, and Tatiana's ultimate escape from Russia, are extremely powerful.  Tatiana matures from a girl who lies across her bed reading a book instead of doing the emergency food shopping her father asks her to do, into a woman who can escape from a frozen wasteland in Finland into Sweden.  That's quite an accomplishment, and long before the author got her there, I was completely absorbed in this woman's story.<br /><br />Despite its faults, this is a story that stays with you after you close it, and that's no mean accomplishment either.  Now I'm off to locate a copy of the sequel, because these two characters, Tatiana & Alexander, live & breathe for me; I HAVE to know what happens next.  I can't remember when that's happened last.

Plot summary:  England, 1925; Chloe, a shy 22-year-old college graduate, is hired by an old scholar to go to Morocco & help him with his research.  On the way to Africa, by ship, she meets a mysterious man, \\"Philip Armand\\" who will turn out to be an Arab sheikh, Pasha ibn Hassim (I think I have that right.) Of course, eventually, Pasha & Chloe have a romance; they even get married, but the marriage is troubled by Chloe's discovery that Pasha is seeking his father's murderer & will pay to have the man killed.<br /><br />First of all, I have to say that I'm not giving 2 stars because this book is horribly written.  I have to give the author kudos because the thing does moves along, even though the characters are one-dimensional, and the first half of the book is good escapism.  But once Chloe reaches Africa, the story and the plotting become SO stupid (you can see the author's wheels turning by this time) so it's like, by the end, WHY did I waste time reading this book?  Even the love scenes aren't too hot, though they are fairly plentiful.<br /><br />And while I was reading this, something else kept bothering me; I always thought the name, Pasha, was actually a form of title in certain countries?  (Unless you're a Russian named Pavel.)<br /><br />Oh, heck, anyway, don't bother!  Go and rent Valentino's \\"Son of the Sheik\\" instead!  Or read Diane Dunaway's \\"Desert Hostage\\" for a REALLY good sand; sun & Sheikh romance novel. It's out of print, but worth the find.	2005-02-10

The plot is a *typical* romance-novel sort -- innocent English girl kidnapped into a Sultan's harem -- but interestingly, the hero, despite his attraction to the heroine, restrains himself from sleeping with her immediately.  They TALK; they learn from each other, and they actually form a friendship.  [Well, the friendship is heavily laced with their thoughts of mutual physical attraction, but then it wouldn't be a romance novel without THAT, would it?]<br /><br />And at least the hero is untypical in that he's been confined by his father's wishes to remain close to home, and he can't travel, educate himself and broaden his horizons as he longs to do.  His talks and friendship with Eleanor help open his eyes to the world outside.  This is very different for a romance-novel hero [particularly the heir of a sultan] and it's a nice touch.<br /><br />But aside from these few points of interest, there was nothing to raise this novel above a pleasant few hours reading; nothing romantically memorable or moving. I knew once I'd finished it, I wouldn't want to read it again.  Therefore, a somewhat reluctant but deserving two stars.	2005-02-10

The beginning chapters of this novel, up to the hero, Gabriel's, escape from slavery on Maria's family plantation, are the best part.  When Maria becomes Gabriel's \\"slave\\" in turn, it's so silly.  For one, Gabriel keeps feeling guilty for making her work, AND keeps taking the work out of her hands, preferably so he can get her into bed. He also has these intrusive servants who keep poking their noses into his business with Maria, too.  Maria just became a little sappy as the book went on.  The romance between the two of them is just strong enough to keep you reading, but I really prefered Busbee's \\"The Tiger Lily\\" over this book.	2005-02-10

It starts out well, but the hero, Sharif's possessiveness, and his attempts at controlling the heroine, Bryna, in the last 1/3 of the book (when she's lost her memory following a trauma) are not very attractive.  Frankly, Sharif's actions toward Bryna put him only a notch above his skank nephew who was Bryna's \\"master\\" in the first place.  Sure, there are moments of sensuality, but when it came to romance, it just wasn't happening.<br /><br />Still, one has to give the author kudos for her research into the Arabian desert, the desert tribes, and Africa in the early-19th century.  She can write, but the romance aspect of this novel just didn't take off.  (And since it IS supposed to be a romance novel, that's kind of important.)	2005-02-07

What kept my interest in the book was Lord John himself, who I felt sympathy for, and I'd like to know more about him, his personal life, as opposed to reading about murders to be solved, or spies; it all seemed superfluous.  I found this book to be vastly more compelling when the focus was on Lord John's inner feelings & desires.  I liked John's friend Quarry; he was, with Lord John, a fully rounded character. Although I was not intrigued by the mystery to be solved, my liking for and interest in John's character kept me going.	2005-02-07

It's not the greatest novel ever written; it's not even the greatest love story ever written, but there's just something so true & touching about the feelings it invokes.  Whenever someone talks about time-travel novels, I always immediately think of this one (and time travel is not a favorite genre of mine).<br /><br />A professor of history (Noelle van Bredin) begins to relive the life of Catherine, the wife of Charles II of England.  In her \\"real\\" life, her marriage falls apart due to her husband's infidelity and she falls in love with Andrew Macdonald, the son of a man who was convicted of espionage with the Soviet Union in 1961.  The novel's setting is thirty years later, and reading it today, parts of it are somewhat dated, but that doesn't spoil the dramatic effect.  The time travel aspect is handled superbly.  As mentioned, time-travel novels are not a favorite genre of mine, but I found this one is really superior in that way.  This is one romance novel the reader can picture as a movie; it's vividly described.  All the emotions are honest.	2005-01-31

This is the first book I've read by this author and I really liked her choice of setting (Mexico, 1865-67). And her way of describing the local people; the country and its customs, and the sprinkling of Spanish words throughout the novel, give it an authentic flavor. The period details are quite well done, although a few modern-day phrases sneak in some of the characters' dialog.<br /><br />But then there's the not-so-good stuff: The heroine was kind of weak.  We are TOLD she's smart & strong & everything a good heroine should be, but she doesn't SHOW particular intelligence.  She has an instantaneous physical attraction to the hero, which frankly I always hate, and it's ridiculous, because from the beginning she suspects the guy might have had something to do with her father's death.  It just wasn't logical that from the first instant she finds out her father's dead, she feels attacted to the guy who may have had something to do with it.  (But he's really tall, dark & handsome so maybe he's not guilty of anything.  And so it turns out.)<br /><br />I was also somewhat puzzled by the heroine's physical appearance.  She's wearing glasses in the beginning of the book but we're told she has blond hair & lovely eyes.  Halfway through the book, she tells the hero she only needs the glasses for needlework, so why was she wearing them when they first met (upon her arrival in Mexico City with her mother)? Was she doing needlework in the carriage as they arrived?  No mention is made of her glasses after she tells the hero she doesn't really need all the time.  It made no sense.  Either she's going to be a heroine who wears glasses, or not.<br /><br />I was further puzzled by the amount of time given to the secondary romance between the heroine's best friend and the hero's half-brother.  Their growing romance & their \\"first time\\" are actually given a couple of chapters, and one loses sight of the main characters' romance.  Then, a chapter later, the best friend and hero's half brother disappear from the story for awhile, and the hero/heroine take center stage again.<br /><br />The hero seemed to have a really stupid reason for keeping himself from loving the heroine.  Something about his mother rejecting him because she thought the hero shamed the family; which is never adequately explained.  But whatever it was, it seemed a silly reason for not letting himself trust the heroine.<br /><br />Also, I thought the ending was just that, THE END, nothing much, blah.  The heroine says, \\"I heard the Emperor (Maximilian) was shot this morning\\" and five lines later, The End.<br /><br />Yet still, some of the writing is above-average, and it does move along (there were some nice touches involving an orphan baby, which really humanize the hero) so I can't say, don't read this book.  In fact, every time I thought I'd put this down and not pick it up again, I found myself caught up again, so that will tell you it's not really horrible.  Just be prepared for a half-good, half-frustrating experience, because you want the book to be so much better than it is.d hero's half brother disappear from the story for awhile, and the hero/heroine take center stage again.

I thought the vulgarity & cruelty of the husband \\"Ben\\" was written in a very heavy-handed way, and the heroine, Sara, was a little too goody-goody for my taste (the way she let herself be taken advantage of by that Tasha character, geez!  Too much a doormat.)<br /><br />The romance kind of got taken over by melodrama at the end.  After a strong start, I lost interest about 1/2 through the book; ironically, right around the time that the hero & heroine confessed their love for each other.  A reader shouldn't experience that loss of interest just at the most interesting point in any romance novel, yet that's what happened to me.  I just couldn't care about these characters.<br /><br />Not a keeper by any means, but 3 stars for a strong first half, and for the fact that the character of the heroine's little son was written in a realistic way (he's not cutesy; not overly talkative beyond his age).	2005-01-24

As someone who's always been curious to learn more about Jennie and her two sisters and their extended families, this book is very informative on that score and I applaud it for that reason. It was especially interesting to me to learn more about the children of Jennie's sisters, Clara Frewen and Leonie Leslie; these being the cousins of Winston Churchill.  The young Frewens in particular had somewhat tortured upbringings, despite their \\"good birth\\" and I came away with a definite feeling of anger against Clara (the oldest sister) for being the selfish and childish creature that she was.  I did think the author's choice of, and the presentation of the photographic illustrations could have been somewhat better (for example, there are instances of several photos all crammed together on one page, and sometimes the quality of the photos are poor). I would have enjoyed seeing more pictures of the sisters in their heyday, as well as more pictures of them as they grew older.<br /><br />Jennie was rather less a creature of her time than her sisters.  She must have been fascinating to know! She was always reaching for the best in life and she had such energy. As the author rightly points out, if she were a man, Jennie would have been a power, but the times didn't allow that to happen for a \\"mere\\" woman.<br /><br />However, that being said, I have to note that the author is a guilty of an odd phenomenon that I am noticing more and more, particularly in works of history and in historical biography.  It's what I call an overt plagiarism.  Now, before anyone gets their hackles up, I'm not accusing this author of being a plagiarist.  It's simply that having read \\"Jennie\\" by Ralph Martin, and Anita Leslie's \\"The Marlborough House Set\\", together with her 1970 biography of Jennie, as well as several of the other books referenced by this author, one can pick out intonations, if you will, that are borrowed therefrom; their phrases, not exactly copied, but the inference of the other author is somehow right there.  It's most obvious, naturally, in the chapters about Jennie, as she was the most famous sister and much more has been written about her.<br /><br />And it's not just this author.  I have noticed this type of overt plagiarism in two other recent works of history, Will Swift's \\"The Roosevelts and the Royals\\" and Princess Michael of Kent's recent book on Diane de Poiters, to name two...I'm going to be generous and assume that because an author has to steep himself in his historical subject, he might not be aware he is adapting another author's turn of phrase; conclusions; intonations; opinions, without giving credit where credit is due...it's NOT a word-for-word plagiarism but it's a unfortunate development which appears to be sadly becoming common in recent histories.

After Cynvelin basically tricks Bryce into kidnapping Rhiannon (turns out he has quite a grudge against Rhiannon's father), Bryce eventually learns how evil Cynvelin really is; all this is set against his growing attraction to Rhiannon and hers to him.<br /><br />Right away, I have to take away a star or two because Rhiannon doesn't get angry enough with Cynvelin, or with Bryce for that matter, for the kidnapping.  She actually thinks, right after the kidnap, \\"I'll tell him I'm sorry but I just can't stay!\\"  (Sorry?  Why are YOU sorry, dummy -- you've just been kidnapped! And you think you have a choice about sticking around?)<br /><br />But, aside from this momentary stupidity, Rhiannon actually becomes a resourceful heroine and an interesting character.<br /><br />It also does take rather a long time for Bryce to realize that Cynvelin isn't all he charmer he makes himself out to be.  However, once he realizes, he's everything a hero should be. I was never quite clear why Bryce lost his family holding; then, the reason is stated, but it's not exactly a compelling one.  Also, it did seem like the author was stringing out Cynvelin's eventual evil intent against the two main characters.<br /><br />With a slightly stronger, less-obviously-prolonged plot and a little more character development for the villain and the hero, this book could easily have been four stars, but it was still fairly good company for a rainy afternoon.	2005-01-10
US	38889875	R8M8JY317APBV	0373290837	576911778	Lady Sarah's Son (Harlequin Historicals #483)	Books	3	2	4	N	N	2.5 stars - weakly plotted	I have to admit that I HATED the character of the little son, Drew.  His speeches (and that's what they are) are just way too advanced for such a little boy; even in 1815 or thereabouts.  This totally unrealistic child's character definitely subtracted a full star from my rating.<br /><br />The whole setup for this story was so, well, impractical.  From the beginning I disliked Sarah's (the heroine) failure to confess to the hero that little Drew is really her sister's son.  After all, Julian is her beloved fiance; surely he would have understood her sister's predicament, and he would have helped Sarah conceal Drew's parentage.  Didn't she THINK she would break Julian's heart by dumping him that way --letting him think there was another man in her life while he's off fighting in the war?  Julian's feelings should have been more important than saving her dead sister's reputation.<br /><br />The plot would have made more sense if, perhaps, there had been another suitor for Sarah before she became engaged to Julian, and Julian might have had some reason to doubt her faithfulness.  The author could then have had Sarah withhold the information about her sister due to her anger about Julian's doubts over her faithfulness.  Immature behavior, sure, yet a plot like that makes more sense than a woman in love, dumping her fiance and breaking his heart when she didn't even need to.<br /><br />Another reason I didn't like the heroine, aside from her martyred silence about her sister's fall from grace -- I had the impression that Sarah thought she could make it \\"all right\\" just too damned easily after breaking Julian's heart, just by rescuing him later from financial ruin with her money.  One plus is that the author really makes Sarah wait for Julian to forgive her.  As well she should!	2005-01-05

I couldn't help but notice that the author got the English titles wrong.  Is this a major issue?  Well, for accuracy's sake, yes, it is.  If you are going to write a serious story about titled British aristocracy, then an author has to get it right. The daughter of an Earl would be Lady X; the eldest son would have a courtesy title.  It was an annoyance (to me) that the younger Greville family members were referred to as the Right Hon. So & So, without the correct titles.  An intelligent editor would have caught & corrected this error.<br /><br />There was something naive in the author's descriptions of certain character's marriages and sex lives...I can't describe it better than naive. I wasn't by any means looking for salacious descriptions, but there was something juvenile in his depiction of Charles and Lydia's marriage, and that of Fenton and Winifred.<br /><br />All that being said, THE PASSING BELLS is a \\"good read\\".  It's the first book of a trilogy, and in my opinion the other two books (CIRCLES OF TIME and A FUTURE ARRIVED) are actually stronger books.  However, in THE PASSING BELLS, the awakening of the character Alexandra to the real horror of war is very good (prior to that, you have to wonder if she's going to be a Barbie doll all her life?).  The character of Martin Rilke comes alive, thanks to his introspective diary (some of the best written parts of the book).  And the last chapter, particularly the very last page, is shocking and very moving.	2004-12-31

THE EARL'S RETURN is that sort of book.  This hero, in particular, is really, REALLY determined not to fall in love with the heroine - and frankly that's not too romantic.<br /><br />Although the two main characters had a romance that was actually broken by the machinations of the heroine's stepfather, the hero can't or won't forgive the heroine for \\"rejecting\\" him, until the last three (3) pages of the book.  He admits that his treatment of the heroine was immature - but, only at the very end of the story.  This doesn't make me like him any better; frankly he wasn't likeable to begin with.  The heroine, on the other hand, is depicted as practically a saint.  And though it's true (as another reviewer put it) she's not exactly a dishrag, she's certainly much too patient.  She needed some spice, and more backbone.  Or some personality growth during the course of the story.<br /><br />It's not entirely a bad story, but it failed to engage my feelings, except for the feeling of mild annoyance with the hero's \\"I'm holding-off-til-the-last-minute\\" admission of love, and his immaturity.  I guess I'd recommend this to those readers who really like or are just used to the Regency genre, but for me it was a slow and draggy read.	2004-12-09

But, in terms of plot and character development, I'd say this story really shows \\"first time writer\\" syndrome.  This is a romance novel, and therefore I could NOT get over the fact that the hero actually rapes the heroine.  He's not much of a hero to begin with (too rich, too controlling, and too spoiled by women).  And the circumstances surrounding the heroine's rape!  The heroine can't talk or scream because her throat is very sore & she's recovering from flu?  And the way she's kidnapped by the hero's drunken friend, while out riding?  The whole scenario just seemed too unreal and overdone.<br /><br />I never believed these two people could fall in love with each other after such a beginning, and Ms. Wolf did not convince me otherwise.	2004-12-07
US	38889875	R1766FSMP41ESV	0373293291	98945736	The Unexpected Bride	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Unexpectedly good story	I like some Harlequin Historicals but am usually careful about the authors I choose to read from this line, because some have proven much better than others.  I did NOT like Ms. Rolls' \\"Dutiful Rake\\", and was pretty much prepared to give this one a miss, but, having read THE UNEXPECTED BRIDE I can only say I'm glad I gave this author another chance.<br /><br />The book is well-plotted, with a mature and ingratiating heroine.  The hero is sometimes a little too cruel and manipulative with his wife.  However, the characters had realistic issues & problems (hero was damaged romantically by his dead wife, which made him distrust women; the heroine has a physical problem that I won't reveal although I think another reviewer does) that needed to be resolved before they could learn to love each other.  I especially liked the fact the hero and heroine actually have a long time alone together at the hero's estate, and get to know each other (even just tentatively) before the action begins to pick up again.  Their feelings weren't just an uncontrollable physical attaction between them; they do actually fall in love by getting to know each other before they sleep together, and that's rare in these Harlequin novels.  I hope Ms. Rolls' next novel is as good as this one turned out to be.	2004-12-07

The hero & heroine don't admit to each other that they are in love with each other, for (basically silly) reason(s).<br /><br />Still, there is something realistic about these characters - they are likeable, ordinary people who hold down jobs, for instance - and the story has a sweetness to it (with appropriately witchy female sub-characters to give you someone to dislike), so that the book ends up being an OK read, if not as good as the author's \\"Blind Date Proposal\\".  BLIND DATE PROPOSAL had a similar plot twist and similar warm & charming heroine paired with a cooler, somewhat uptight hero, but is a superior book to CHRISTMAS EVE MARRIAGE.  I only just liked Christmas Eve Marriage and would recommend Blind Date Proposal over it.	2004-12-03

It's romantic, warm and heartfelt, with realistic characters.  Kate is the befuddled, but warm and charming heroine who hasn't had any luck with men in her life, and Finn is her uptight, cold boss, a widower who gradually turns into Kate's love interest.  Finn's 10 year old daughter, Alex, was a very realistic child character (which I don't often see in a romance novel).  It was a pleasure to see Kate grow into a stonger person over the course of the story.  You could easily see this book as a movie and it would be great (are you listening, Hollywood?)  It's an excellent read, and I recommend it highly.	2004-12-03

The Hero (he deserves the capital H), Simon Hunt -- he's the most well-rounded, well-written character in this book.  When he's around, the book sparkles; when he's not, the plot is just going round & round.  Every other character is so one-dimensional.<br /><br />As the story progressed, I couldn't figure out why such a dynamic, go-getting, independent man like Simon wanted a stick-figure, dull, confused and somewhat stuck up heroine like Annabelle.  The only distinguishing characteristics she has is that she's well bred and poor!  Very, very rich men don't often marry Cinderellas, particularly in Victorian England...you'd think, if he REALLY wanted to break into Society, he'd look for a younger daughter of an impoverished Earl, or something like that...Which brings me to another point: WHY is this novel set in 1843?  \\"Brash Americans\\" didn't start storming English Society until after Jennie Jerome married Randolph Churchill in 1874.  The \\"vulgar\\" American girls, trying to crack Society's boundaries, are so out of place in 1843.  Why is Kleypas still bringing in the wrong elements for this period (as she did in \\"Again the Magic\\").<br /><br />But to get back to the book's quality -- this isn't \\"keeper\\" Kleypas; reading it was only a fairly pleasant journey, thanks to Simon, but overall, I felt like I wasted time and money.	2004-11-24

Despite the well-written -- my gosh, VERY well-written -- sex scenes, and a sexy hero, this book is definitely NOT 5 stars.  It has the often-seen, thus overused, very insecure heroine, combined with a \\"I need a fake fiance\\" plot (with a gay boyfriend thrown in for good measure, just to give the heroine some extra angst to beat herself up with).  For the obvious reason, she was a \\"failure\\" with him in bed, so, she thinks she's not a good sex partner at all.<br /><br />Despite giving the heroine Jordan some realistic and likeable touches such as worrying about having stretch marks, and being uncomfortable about her appearance while \\"on top\\", Jordan is really very one-dimensional.  From the way Jordan is presented, I simply couldn't believe this supposedly high-powered female attorney had even passed the bar exam.  Jordan is so wimpy as to be scared of her COUSIN's reactions and her cousin's bitchery if she finds out Jordan doesn't actually have a fiance at the big family reunion.  So, Jordan hooks up with her gay boyfriend's super-sexy-fireman twin brother, to give credence to her story.  Come on!  I wanted to throw the book across the room by page 50.<br /><br />Still, even though I did not appreciate the inane plot twists or even especially like the bland wimpy heroine, I have to give the book 2 stars for the 'scenes'.  I'd rather recommend to this author that she write full-blown erotica -- she certainly has a talent for writing 'the scenes', but the Harlequin Presents-style lame plot devices and wimpy-simpy heroines have got to GO.	2004-11-24

He's not the best writer in the world, and he does his subject no service by romanticizing; being melodramatic (that title!), and/or speculating about her life and the people who surround her.  I recognize that it must be difficult to write a biography of someone who ordered her personal papers destroyed, which must be why Mr. Sullivan indulges in speculation at times.  I preferred John Van der Kiste's \\"Princess Victoria Melita\\" as the better biography of this granddaughter of Queen Victoria; it's a far more balanced biography than Mr. Sullivan's.	2004-11-05

Oddly, despite the author's admiration for Otto the statesman, we never learn much about Otto, the inner man.  A balanced biography should have both sides of the story.  I, too, noticed many of the errors cited by the other reviewer...

Christina, who has been a virtuous wife for 12 years (despite a cheating, uncaring husband) falls immediately into lust/love with Max, during a house party.  And Max, the lover extraordinare, the rake who can't be caught, is just as \\"immediate\\" in his newfound love/lust for Christina.  For me it would have been a much better story if they fell SLOOOWLY into love.<br /><br />There was something skeevy in Max's sleeping with Christina's friend the day or two before he ends up in bed with Christina.<br /><br />I felt that Christina's leap from repressed wife to Max's lusty lover happened WAY too fast, and Max's reformation from sleep-around rake to Christina's one-and-only was unbelievably quick.  Frankly, the constant sex scenes got a bit tiresome.  These characters became two partners in a sex show instead of two people in love.<br /><br />The whole thing just slides into melodrama, with Christina's husband imprisoning her and almost poisoning her after he discovers her affair with Max.<br /><br />Very disappointing.	2004-11-03

I mean, really horribly, laughably bad.  And, excuse me, another reviewer said this book has a strong heroine??  Sara is a WIMP.  We get page after page of her self-berating introspection.  She's quietly and patiently loved her selfish, arrogant, people-using boss, for TEN, count 'em, TEN years!  And Sara doesn't even realize for HERSELF that he's a user; she needs her boss' bitchy fiancee to tell her so.<br /><br />So FINALLY she leaves her job & goes home to recover from her raging masochism, and meets Stuart the dull-as-dishwater (but handsome) hero.  Thanks to her parents' efforts to fix them up they get married...their growing romance is about as dull and stupid as these characters are...the novel is basically written from Sara's POV, so you never figure out why Stuart would be attracted to this wishbone-for-backbone heroine.  Romance novels like this only end up annoying the stuff out of me.  Because they have such transparent plots & unrealistic, SILLY characters.  What a waste of my time.<br /><br />Oh, yes, don't let me forget to tell you, that after setting up Sara's boss &#34;Ian&#34;, as a crappy, selfish man with a heart of stone, the author makes Ian come looking for Sara (admittedly he only wants her back as a secretary, but don't you think a phone call would have been more realistic than his coming all the way out to her parents' place?)  This ultra-dumb plot twist was just one more obvious effort by the author at keeping the H/H from admitting their &#34;love&#34; for a little while longer, because of course Stuart sees Ian and Sara talking, & draws the wrong conclusion.<br /><br />This story is definitely NOT one of Ms. Jordan's better efforts.	2004-11-02

I generally read historical or contemporary romance.  But that said, THE CAPTIVE caught and held my interest.  Referring to the other reviewers, I agree that, yes, Falkon the hero, could really have grabbed that controller sooner, and yes, Ashlynne the heroine was a spoiled little rich-girl who treats the enslaved Falkon badly in the beginning... But on the other hand, the author takes the time to explain why these things are the way they are (Falkon is unwillingly attracted to Ashlynne from the beginning, though he hates himself for this - so maybe subconsciously, he doesn't mind so much, being in her 'control'? - Even he considers this thought), and, Ashlynne is made to suffer for being the spoiled little rich-girl she is, about halfway through the story, so I'm not seeing why other reviewers got down on her so much.<br /><br />I thought the eventual love story between Ashlynne & Falkon was tender -- particularly once Ashlynne started to show her intelligence and behave less like a spoiled brat.  I loved Falkon's change of heart from revenge and bitterness, to forgiveness.  This story moved quickly but not totally at the expense of character development.  Sexual scenes are fairly vanilla, but sweet.<br /><br />I thought I wouldn't like a futuristic romance like THE CAPTIVE, but if I could find a few others like this, I'd read more of them.	2004-10-22

I don't ever throw a book away.  I'll donate them to libraries if I don't like them or can't keep them...but this book was thrown into the GARBAGE with all speed.<br /><br />I've read & enjoyed Penny Jordan books before, but this novel is really, really awful.  She fell flat on her face with this one.<br /><br />The hero, Alexei, despite all his handsomeness, suave manners, & money, is nothing but a rapist, pure & simple.  First, he KIDNAPS the heroine, who is completely innocent & convent-bred (and a dope, but more about that later), because:  his sister was the mistress of the heroine's father and the sister committed suicide when the heroine's father wouldn't marry her.  Alexei doesn't seduce the heroine, (despite what Penny Jordan wants the reader to believe), he just takes her to his big country estate and he RAPES her.  And despite Jordan's attempts to gloss this over with her heroine's half-felt \\"attraction\\" to the hero from the instant she meets him, it comes down to this:  it's a rape, because she's completely inexperienced and he isn't, and, he takes her against her will.  AND THE HEROINE NEVER LIFTS A HAND TO HIM!  SHE JUST LETS HIM DO IT!  And I just could not get over that.  No amount of the author's sugar-coating the hero's rationale for his behavior can overcome that fact.  And making her heroine SO wimpy as to just let it happen, with NO fight...and for her to still feel ATTRACTED to this man?  Oh, but after all, Alexei bought her pretty clothes, and it took place in a nice soft bed, in a rich country house...it was just disgusting.  A really low point, one of the lowest in any romance novel I've ever read!<br /><br />So this book made the garbage bin.  I think I would have burned it if I could have.  It's really repulsive & creepy that a \\"romance\\" novel could sink to these lows.  I really hate this book.  It tries to gloss over a rape!  It's awful books like this one that give romance novels a bad name.	2004-10-20

It definitely WANTED to be, but it's got a somewhat confusing story line with way too many different conflicts going on.  There was the heroine's trying to keep her brother safe; the hero's conflict over whether he should love her or deliver her to the King; the hero's family problems; the heroine's skeevy uncle & his plots; the heroine's Scottish family...yada yada, and none of this gelled into something really attention-grabbing.<br /><br />The heroine, Gabby (terrible name) was just \\"nice\\", no spice...tho' everyone kept saying how brave & resourceful she is, I just didn't feel it.

In LORD OF SCOUNDRELS, it's the hero's horrible childhood and its wretched emotional aftermath that keeps him from forming a bond with the heroine.  And while maybe that's a plot that's been done before, in LORD OF SCOUNDRELS, it's really done right.<br /><br />And the heroine is strong enough and smart enough to help the hero overcome his trauma.  And, even nicer, you feel that the requisite happy ending isn't all just a band-aid -- that the hero may well go on having problems, but the heroine will always stand by him and keep helping him work it all out.  Now, that's good writing!  Definitely, I will look for more books by this author, she's got to have another keeper like this somewhere.	2004-10-12

I enjoyed this biography very much.  I thought Van der Kiste's writing was stronger here than in \\"Once a Grand Duchess\\".	2004-10-06

Hester Waring, a neglected, starving & destitute gentlewoman, is given a chance to be the town schoolteacher in Sydney Australia, early 1800's.  Her situation and her own personality (she retains her spirit) attracts Tom Dilhorne, ex-convict, who's worked to become the wealthiest man in Sydney.  Hester agrees to marry Tom and the way the author writes about their marriage, is just so skillful.  They grow to love and cherish each other through difficult times caused by outsiders...can't say more without giving too much of the plot, but this book is WORTH reading.  The plot, the character development, the tender romance, it's all five-stars.  Go to eharlequin.com for an inexpensive copy.  If you are looking for a romance read that has MORE than just textbook romance situations and characters, this is the one to get!  It's the kind of novel you can easily see as a movie -- if only someone would make a movie like this book, it would be great.	2004-10-04

Putney's novella, which is re-issued in this collection (it was originally written in 1994) is the longest story, and a very enjoyable re-working of the marriage between the 9th Duke of Marlborough and Consuelo Vanderbuilt. I loved all the little historically accurate details that Putney put into this tale, which really helped to build up the characters and make them true-to-life.  I LOVED the Gayle Wilson story \\"My Darling Echo\\" -- really a beautiful, tender tale.  It could have been a full length novel, for my money...I would have loved that even more!  I didn't like the Merlaine Lovelace story very much at all.  But both of the other stories are well worth the price of this book, and they make it a keeper.	2004-10-04

She's creative, all right, and the plot is a strong one (illegitimate heroine impersonating her dead sister; hero struggles not to fall in love with her; he has an ex-mistress who's a genuine witch).  The setting is exciting (the War of the Roses).  But it's all rather flat.  I found it annoying that the heroine was kidnapped not less than three times by her old fiance! The hero admits his love for the heroine pretty quickly into the story, which is both good & bad...it's nice that he's not concealing his feelings til the bitter end, like most heroes do, but it's also boring to hear them pledge their love over & over & over.  It's a good enough read, but not a keeper.	2004-09-27

I read this book out of the order of the Kuzan series, but I'm not sorry I did; I looked at each book individually; happily, Susan Johnson makes it possible to do so.  What I mean is, you don't have to read the first book (Seized by Love) to understand the second (Love Storm) or read the second to understand the third (Sweet Love, Survive).  I was impressed by the author's placing the story in post-Tsarist, revolutionary Russia -- I've never yet read another historical romance author who used this setting (except Dr. Zhivago, but that's another kind of book!)  Kind of nice, to get away from Regency England; the 19th century and medieval settings.  I wish more romance authors would take a crack at a setting like this.<br /><br />Just an aside, I thought I would laugh through the book about a hero named Apollo (for Pete's sake, Apollo!), and kept thinking if only his name were Alexei or something suitably Russian... but Ms. Johnson is so skillful I forgot about the non-Russian sounding name & thought it suited him perfectly...couldn't imagine him being called anything else, after getting along in the story.<br /><br />I just really enjoyed this story: it moved right along, it had a strong plot & I loved the characters...it had everything I want in a romance-read, basically.  It's NOT a \\"gentle, romantic\\" read, but if you're in the mood for swiftly-paced action, this is a good choice. It's a very good choice for \\"escapist\\" lit.  I found myself really intrigued & had to keep reading, even when I had other things to do!	2004-09-22

I admit I have a problem with Mary Balogh's longer fiction. I find she crams an awful lot of plot twists & turns into her \\"Super\\" regencies, and in some of her longer novels...in place of character development, there's alot of dialog & plot weakness. There was just too much going on here, the romantic element & sexual tension (which Balogh can write so well in her shorter fiction) got overwhelmed.  There was nothing particularly memorable about this hero or heroine; frankly, they seemed pretty blah.  The reason they initially got separated seemed weak, and the reason they finally got together seemed weaker.  So what if the hero cried when the heroine miscarried?  I didn't feel anything for him, I just didn't care.  This was kind of a \\"by the numbers\\" Balogh, with all her signature bits, but no heart.	2004-09-20

You would think, from Ms. Johnson's own apologia in the preface of this book, together with the reviews here on Amazon, that the plot and characters' behavior(s) in this novel made it the biggest Neanderthal throwback to the dark ages of romance novels ever.<br /><br />Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  Nikolai may not be the most evolved 19th century gentleman ever created, but he's a typical product of his time (fabulously wealthy, Russian, aristocrat).  The heroine, Alisa, has spunk and speaks up against Nikki when he's just too obnoxious; she's not a wimp, just (again) a product of her time...Women were in the control of men during the 19th century, in all countries, and our latter-day freedoms were hard wins.  As for the sensuality & \\"scenes\\", well, frankly, I've read books that poured it on much, much more raunchily than Ms. Johnson does here; it's all pretty basic!  (That's a good thing, it's not a negative!)  Having never read anything by Ms. Johnson before, I can say I enjoyed this novel and would read more by her; she's a good writer.  I think the relationship between Nikki & Alisa was just \\"romantic\\" enough, considering the protagonists involved & the times they were living in, and the end, when Nikki finally comes around to confessing his love for Alisa, is super.	2004-09-17

This novel began well, and could have been wholly good -- if the author had concentrated on building up a romantic attraction between the hero & heroine.<br /><br />Francesca (Chessie), two years prior to the opening date of this story, has gone to work for the famous author who purchased her family's house, after her financial-advisor father gypped his clients out of their money and suddenly died.  So, we have Chessie working for the hero for almost 2 years, and living on the premises, but there's been nothing between her & the hero except for a working relationship.  This was a mistake, IMO.  The author should have at least hinted that the hero found Chessie attractive, or vice-versa, in the beginning; but no, she waits until the very end for the hero to confess he wanted to \\"protect\\" the heroine from the instant he saw her!  Who knew?<br /><br />After its beginning, which is actually promising, the whole book starts to go belly up when an old boyfriend of Chessie's comes home from America, and her teenage sister starts acting out and running around with a drug-pushing grunge.  Also thrown in this mix is the jealous, catty neighbor/stepmother of Chessie's old beau, and her stroke-victim husband.  That's a lot of characters in this mix.  Too much for a Harlequin, really.  And all of these people drag the romance factor down even further.<br /><br />Someone ought to shake Sara Craven for creating a heroine as wimpy as Chessie turns out to be.  The plot machinations were unbelieveable.  I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned the stupidity of the hero's asking the heroine to marry him, seemingly out of the blue, for no reason.  The hero just springs the proposal on her; it's silly.  The snotty younger sister was VERY annoying (yet, believeably written -- 1 star for the little bit of realism in this character).  The other star I give this book is for the well-written sex scene that occurs near the end.  After slogging through the unbelieveable plot, and wondering when the heroine would get a spine instead of a wishbone, from out of nowhere, Ms. Craven produces a really sensual love scene, frankly the best part of the book.  But even THAT gets spoiled by the hero's not loving or trusting the heroine enough to tell her, afterwards, he's got to have a serious operation -- He leaves her while she's sleeping and she has to find out that he's gone into the hospital from another source!  And this is supposed to be romantic?<br /><br />All in all, can't recommend this.the heroine would get a spine instead of a wishbone, from out of nowhere, Ms. Craven produces a really sensual love scene, frankly the best part of the book.

Lowell before and was very impressed with ENCHANTED.  This book begins slowly and takes you along slowly, but I hasten to say, that's not a bad thing. I thought the two main characters, and all the supporting cast too, were very well developed.  It's a more complex medieval romance novel, than most.  It's also a very heartfelt novel, very moving in places, and I can say I admired the two main characters equally - which I don't often do!

I liked the hero of this novel, William Donovan, at least up to a point (more about that later), but the heroine, Viola, left MUCH to be desired.  Once Viola and William became lovers, SHE seemed to lose all her spine, becoming a babyish child-woman in her attitude to William, and HE became an unattractive alpha male, ordering her to wear what HE wanted; do what HE wanted... with just little flaky bits of reluctance on her part.  Not very attractive behavior at all.<br /><br />What I liked about William was that initially he fantasized about the heroine as a unobtainable fairy princess, and he really seemed to *love* or at least, feel a secret tenderness for Viola, when she was unobtainable.  But once they became a couple he was all about dominating her, with Viola at first timidly, and then avidly, going along.  This development, to me, was really disappointing.  I prefer a story where the hero and heroine are presented as equally strong, thoughtful and determined people - in bed or out!  William and particularly Viola are fairly one-dimensional characters.<br /><br />The author can spin a story and the book is, I admit, hard to put down, but the lack of depth and believability in the main characters didn't make me care much for them, or about them, though I did want to see what was going to happen next in their story.<br /><br />The \\"scenes\\" are certainly erotic & sensual enough for readers who want that in their romance novels (along the lines of R. Schone et al., with raunchy language by page 2!).<br /><br />Taken as a whole, this was just a 3-star read for me, but I realize it could be more highly rated by other readers, particularly those who like their romance/erotic reads \\"strong\\".	2004-09-14

I'd say this is a solid 3-star romantic novel.  There's not much depth to either of the main characters, aside from their physical beauty, and the instant attraction they feel for each other.  The novel's setting is an exciting one -- Mary Tudor's court; Spain & the Spanish Inquistion in the 1550's...yet, despite flashes of creative writing, this romance novel doesn't take off and become memorable or even especially moving.  I did want to keep reading, however; I never quite lost interest in the story or its characters and wanted to know what was going to happen.  Unusually, I felt more sympathy for supporting characters, such as poor old Queen Mary Tudor; the hero's brother Cristobal, and even the hero's wife (yes, he's married), than I did for the hero and the heroine!<br /><br />In the final analysis, it's a \\"good\\" read, but in the end, not a keeper due to a certain superficiality in the presentation of the hero & heroine.	2004-09-02

She's written two other Harlequin Presents prior to this one, that I know of, and they were both good -- but this one falls into the trap of what I'd term typical Harlequin characteristics:<br /><br />1.  The instant & uncontrollable sexual attraction between H/H from the first instant of seeing each other;<br />2.  Extreme, unflawed good looks for both;<br />3.  Rich hero, poor heroine;<br />4.  No parents for either of them (they're always killed off in car wrecks, it seems -- and when I saw that the hero had lost his parents that way, I knew I was in trouble);<br />5.  Noble, self-sacrificing heroine who the hero just has to come after in the end...because there's no one else who can do it for him in the bedroom, and oh yeah, because he can finally admit he loves her.<br /><br />In the meantime, the heroine's already she's admitted to herself that she's in love with him, at least 25 pages prior to the hero finally admitting that he's in love with her.<br /><br />Oh I expected so much more of Julia James!  I know WHERE she went wrong, I just want to know WHY?  Why so sterotypical in the plot & the characterizations when she'd shown so much more imagination before??<br /><br />All that being said, this isn't a horrible read, but, darn it, after reading her two prior books, I was very let down by this one.

(Just kidding -- I know the Duke of Clarence was not Jack the Ripper.)  But why are all biographers of royalty so skittish of coming out and saying that the oldest son, Prince Eddy, had homosexual experiences?  All you ever get is just a hint about this.  There's got to be information in the Royal archives or in private letters that back this up.  And it was over a hundred years ago, can't they come out with some definite information now?<br /><br />Anyway, getting back to this book, just basic facts about the children of Edward VII are blandly presented. It gives you an nice overview of the lives, but there's no in-depth look at the children's characters, or their lives.  For instance, I read about the middle daughter, Victoria's, brief teenage crush on her cousin Tsar Nicholas II, in a totally different book (The Romanovs: Power, Passion & Tragedy).  Why wasn't that tidbit included here?  Also, we learn nothing about Victoria's frustration at being kept a spinster in the service of her mother Queen Alexandra, and there's nothing here about her two thwarted romances.  What did Victoria think and feel about these thwarted romances?  From another source, I learned that Maud and Haakon VII of Norway's marriage wasn't all that happy, either, but how bad, or good, was it really?<br /><br />We don't learn the answer to these questions from this book.  So in that respect, it's a disappointment.  I don't mean to say I want to read trashy gossip, but this book is just too \\"nice\\", somewhat slow and bland.	2004-08-26

The author doesn't bring forth any evidence regarding Ena's feelings about being a carrier of hemophilia, like Robert Massie did for Alexandra in \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\".  How did Ena cope with two hemophiliac sons, and why did she treat her second son, Jaime, so coldly?  What were her relationships with her daughters?  Was she afraid they would carry the gene, too?  How did Ena feel when her brother Maurice was killed in WWI, just two days after she gave birth to her last child?  These are the things I really would have liked to find out.

However, even in a weak novel, Ms. Jaffe is still a clever writer, whose plot did keep me turning the pages, so I can't say that the book was really bad, even though it had its weaknesses.  Ms. Jaffe's tried-n-true formula of writing about the lives of a group of women was not successful here.  The character of Vanessa was the most interesting and \\"alive\\" to me, I would rather have read a whole book about her.  Cady's happy ending seems false.

I found most of it tedious and unrealistic (I hate to say \\"unrealistic\\" regarding a work of fiction, and plus it's a romance novel, but darn it, there should be some elements of realism to the plot and/or in the character's motivations to make these things work).<br /><br />I loved the premise of the letter-writing between the H/H --I give this book the 3 stars for that spurt of imagination and creativity on the author's part --but I thought this element could have been continued for a longer period of time.  To me, this exchange of letters was the most interesting part of this book - a really inventive way for the reader to learn about the characters, and for the main characters to learn about each other.<br /><br />Speaking of the people in this novel, there are (too) many characters but none of them are particularly compelling or memorable.  I liked the hero, but only insofar as the person he was in his letters to the heroine.  I thought the heroine behaved ridiculously in re: her decision NOT to marry the hero.  If you love someone, you have to trust that person not to hurt you; the fact that she couldn't trust the hero (at least initially) pointed up the fact that her \\"love\\" for him wasn't truly love at all.  When she did her about-face, it felt as false as that which had gone before.<br /><br />If I read another Brockway, I guess I'll hope for better luck next time.	2004-08-17

But this book is rescued by its sexy, masculine and vulnerable hero (definitely not an alpha-male) and the sexual tension that Ms. Craig generates between the hero & heroine. In short:  hero's great; heroine so-so; the plot is not without silliness & contrivances, yet the book's still worth reading for the interaction and sexual tension between the two main characters.  These elements kept me reading straight through this.<br /><br />I loved Ms. Craig's \\"Empire of the Heart\\" and have been going through her backlist hoping for another gem like that.  This isn't it, but it's pretty good.	2004-07-13

If a plot is set in a certain time period, or historical setting, it's got to have its facts straight - in my opinion.<br /><br />That being said, this book was riddled with errors from page 2 on.  If the author had only read just ONE biography of Edward VII, she would have realized that he had a very strong sense of \\"lese majesty\\" and never allowed himself to be treated with familiarity even by his \\"friends\\" (as he is here).  Plus his name was ALBERT Edward, Prince of Wales, during the time when this story takes place; not Prince Edward Albert (he only became \\"Edward\\" officially after Queen Victoria's death).  Well, you get the picture, I could go on but won't for the sake of brevity.<br />Just let me mention that the heroine, during her presentation at Court, refers to \\"Prince Edward Albert\\" and Queen Victoria, to their faces, as \\"your majesties\\", not once, but twice.  That's the kind of sloppy fact-checking/editing that's going on in this novel.<br /><br />But worse, even if you put the historical boo-boos aside, this book is really stiff and slow - hard to pick up again once you put it down, and downright dull.  Its characters are stock figures with no depth aside from their good looks; they are not unique or original.<br /><br />This one will be going into my library's donation bin with all speed.  I gave it one star because it was NOT as dull as \\"Flight of Fancy\\" which is the prequel to this story, but that's not saying much.	2004-07-08

I've read lots of Mary Balogh's books by now and I love several of her shorter Signet Regencies, (The Temporary Wife -- so good) ~but, I always have a problem with her longer fiction (the Slightly series; etc.)  What works so well in her shorter fiction just doesn't work in her longer novels for me.  DECEIVED is one of her longer Regencies.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time giving it a high rating but I can't quite give it a lower one either!  I'm also not sure it's going on my keeper shelf yet!<br /><br />My big problem with this one is:  I don't really ever LIKE the heroine.  She seems weak; easily manipulated by the people surrounding her, including the hero, through the whole book.  (I know, there's the time period thing; women had no rights, but still...)  Elizabeth's attachment to her stepbrother Martin seems over-emphasized in the beginning - she spent 7 YEARS in the country with him, recovering from her breakup with the hero?  Seems excessive.  And Martin's perversions were pretty disturbing.  Yet, the author did somehow make it all come together in the end, so I have to give her kudos for that.  I absolutely loved the first chapter; it's a great set-up, a real lesson for aspiring romance writers.  Also, I could not put the book down, so that speaks for itself.  The story certainly moves along, and I do like the hero, Christopher, although he's pretty slow on the uptake vis-a-vis the stepbrother's manipulation.  If he wasn't, there'd be no plot, and yet the fact that Christopher, and Elizabeth, don't realize sooner that they've been manipulated, makes ME, as a reader, feel manipulated, just a bit.  I actually think this story might have been more successful if it had been shorter - actually, like Mary Balogh's Signet Regencies.<br /><br />As you see it's very hard for me to grade this reading experience, but 3.5 is probably a fair grade.	2004-07-08

And this one is 'OK' but, five stars?  No.  The plot has good moments, and the writer is creative, but still...I can't put my finger on it, but I was able to put this one down with no problem.  My criteria for a 5-star read has to be that I didn't want to stop reading.  I didn't have that feeling with this novel -- and I could wait to pick it up again too.  Maybe I thought it was too melodramatic.  It felt like I'd met this hero & heroine before.  If I were grading it like in school, I'd give it an 85 out of 100, or a B+.  So, yes, I think it's good, but it's not the gripping, emotional keeper that other reviewers described, at least not for me.	2004-06-29

Now I know when she writes a 4/5 star review, it's usually bogus.)<br /><br />The REAL review of this novel is that it's DULL.  I felt had no enthusiasm for this story.  Ms. Smith wanted to tell a moving, tear-jerking love story but ended up with a silly, shallow plot (the so-called mystery of who's writing threatening letters to Vie is solved in a really dumbed-down way!) and there's a clumsy feel to its execution.  There's no tension, there's no excitement.  I give it 2 stars for the hero, who has some depth to him, but for the rest:  the heroine; plot; supporting characters; dialog - bah humbug.  After reading \\"For the First Time\\" I thought Kathryn Smith was an author to watch for, but this novel is a big step backward.	2004-06-28

This book is hard to put down.  It's sensual, it's got a fantastic story line, and a really lovable hero and heroine.<br /><br />Piero takes the heroine Bianca as a wife, though he doesn't love her, but the way he helps her to grow into a strong, determined woman worthy of BEING loved, is more important than the fact that he doesn't love her initially.  And then when he slowly but surely does fall in love with her -- well, you just have to read it yourself, to discover the brilliance of this story's resolution.

For a story involving prison escapes; spying, and a Romeo-Juliet love story, it was so dull!  (I was shocked to learn from the author's information that she'd won a prize for her writing.)  The heroine's parents were cartoonish, semi-evil characters, with no development.  The so-called fiance, Payton, was the same.  And, excuse me, after the heroine's two hateful parents tried to force the heroine into a marriage with a completely reprehensible man -forcing her to leave her home to escape this fate- at the end of the book, she writes to her father than she wants to come back for a VISIT?!?  That strains credibility.  But quite a bit of this book did that!<br /><br />I give this book its star for the Shakespeare's quotations the hero/heroine spoke to each other...and for the very beginning of their romance.  The plot showed some imagination, but the author lacked the verve and talent to make it exciting.  I had lost interest in the outcome by the middle of the story.<br /><br />Unless you're a serious collector of Civil War romances and must own every one ever written - do yourself a favor and forget reading this one. I can't believe there's a five-star review of this novel.	2004-06-16

I read quite a few Harlequins, mostly impulse buys at the grocery store, and 9 times out of 10, I regret the impulse.<br />My expectations were for something light; kind of stupidly plotted, with shallow characters having sex to move the thing along -- BUT -- this book happily proved me wrong.  It's got a superior plot; well-written, believable & realistic characters and alot of insight! It was refreshing to read a Harlequin where the characters actually grow & change while the plot is moving along.  The two main characters become friends before they are lovers, and so we get to learn alot about them -- for once, it's NOT about some unbelieveable, uncontrollable sexual attraction between two unbelievably beautiful people.  And what a nice touch (spoiler coming)...that they wait until they get married before they make love.  (I almost wrote, \\"have sex\\", but these characters DO make love.)  The setting is a great one, & you can tell the author loves & knows Spain.  A surprising keeper!  Thanks, Ms. Weale.	2004-06-14

Smart & resourceful heroine (except for a mistake she makes toward the end, putting herself & hero in grave danger...but love makes fools of us all, and she suffers for it, so I forgave her) and sexy, smart & wonderful hero!  Setting is 1870's Afghanistan, India, and England -- how's that for different locales?  (Also, it's amazing how the author's thoughts on Afghanistan are relevant to today's situation.)  Everything about the plot is great, you can't stop reading it from the minute you open it...I am SO glad I took the trouble to get this long-out-of-print book.

But...I have some definite reservations and/or opinions about its quality.  It was odd that, while reading it, I found myself wanting to know more of the backstories of minor characters such as, Angharad, Emrys and Owen.  These characters as written were more \\"alive\\" to me than the noble, somewhat bloodless, hero and heroine Alexander and Sian.  They just seemed to \\"be there\\", not \\"live\\" there.  Even Alexander's little daughter didn't seem \\"real\\" -- she FELT like a plot device to bring Alexander and Sian together.  I can't imagine a little girl wanting to learn Welsh, and otherwise verbally expressing all her feelings so clearly, at age 6.  More than once the little girl conveniently runs around & amuses herself while the H/H get to know each other better... bah.<br /><br />I thought the resolution of Sian's conflict with her father was too quick.  He'd been a non-participant or an irritant in her life for most of her life.  You have the major factor of Sian's illegitimacy and her longing to belong somewhere all her life, and then, boom! during the last 25 pages of the novel, she's able to accept her father's help without further reservations and they're able to establish a courteous, LOVING relationship?<br /><br />Also, I didn't care for the way all the plotlines and character's conflicts were tidily resolved by the end of the book, each with a happy-ever-after feel.  The resolution of each character's conflicts (with the exception of Owen's) had the \\"flavor\\" of realism, but not the reality of actual lives being lived.<br /><br />Harsh words?  Probably.  But oddly enough I don't dislike this book.  In fact, I HAD to keep reading it, couldn't put it down.  It's written with too much feeling to be put aside; you do want to know what happens, even if it's all a bit too tidy in the end.  And if the two main characters are a bit too good & noble to be true, well, I could overlook that, because the rest of the book: the historical background; the setting in Wales; characterizations of all the minor characters with the exception of the unreal little daughter, are all good.<br /><br />And it must be said that the sensual scenes in this book are probably the best written by Mary Balogh, who I generally think from her other work, is a romance writer who can't write these scenes at all.the setting in Wales; characterizations of all the minor characters with the exception of the unreal little daughter, are all good.

If I'm reading a historical romance novel, I like the research to be thorough & accurate.  It just didn't ring true that Alexandra could reach the position at the British Museum that she held, in Victorian England of 1865, even with her father's influence, and also, that she would have a female secretary, AND male underlings, working for her.<br /><br />That being said, the first part of the book moved along quickly and sensibly, and I liked Christopher, the hero, who is a self-made man, and is not full of himself but is not a pushover, either.  The heroine was interesting but as I mentioned, her position is not entirely believable.<br /><br />This book had its good moments and some flashes of good writing, but it was one of those books where I kept thinking, while I was reading it, how much better it could have been.  These characters had a lot going for them, but the plot and its resolution just didn't jell into a really good read; it never really rises above \\"fair\\".  So unfortunately I can't really recommend it.	2004-05-14

The author takes the time in Chapter One to set up her heroine as being a strong woman who can think for herself and stand by her choices in life.  Then, beginning in chapter 2, after she meets the (initially) mysterious & compellingly handsome hero, she develops a wishbone instead of a spine.  From that point the story degenerates into the typical Harlequin formula of alpha-male takes over wishy-washy heroine from an indifferent (or non-existent) family, and shows her the best sex she's ever had.  And of course, despite the plethora of birth control around these days, the heroine ends up pregnant after all that fantastic sex, and the alpha male demands she marry him.  And she's full of doubts over whether he loves her or he's just marrying her for the baby, and will her poor experience with her unhappily married parents make HER marriage equally bad?<br /><br />Why oh why do I buy these things?  The first chapter was good and that hooked me -- but it's too little to make this one a keeper.	2004-05-14

This story started out really, really well, with the plight of the neglected veterans of Waterloo, and the heroine's efforts to help them.  Then, somehow as it moved along, there was something lacking about the main characters and in the story, especially toward the end. Maybe it was the silliness of the hero and heroine having to pretend to have met in Spain and to be married, for the benefit of the Hero's family.  I agree with the reviewer who said the heroine's family were like caricatures.  I found myself skimming toward the end without really caring about these people, which is a shame, because their story started out so strongly & interestingly.	2004-05-11

But this is one novella that's not 4 or 5 stars.  The heroine is weak-willed (and inexperienced - untypical of Reid); the hero is nothing more than the usual controlling alpha-male.  The plot is nothing special.  But because it's Michelle Reid it moves along briskly and without TOO much sugar-sweetness from the heroine (her finest moment:  quitting her job because her boss is gleeful over his girlfriend's abortion).  I didn't get TOO annoyed with this story, until closer to the end.  But, it's forgettable - definitely no keeper.	2004-05-04

It is well-written, but the heroine is frankly dull, with no depth, and the hero is so reserved (along with impatient and brusque) that it's hard to warm up to him.  There's no heat between the two main leads.  The 2 1/2 stars I grant it come from the charming secondary characters, and the plot, which is better than average for a Harlequin romance.  Also, I appreciated the way the author varied to and from the heroine's and hero's viewpoints.  Still, it was mostly the heroine's viewpoint, and she's kind of weak.  It had sweet moments, but I could have passed this one over without regret.	2004-05-03

The premise is OK:  biological mother goes to find her daughter, given up at birth, and gets a position as her nanny, keeping her secret for the time being.  The adoptive father is extremely handsome, wealthy & powerful & lives in a beautiful estate.  The leads hit the sack too quickly for my taste - drawing out the tension would have been better (the overwhelming attraction thing, I find SO tired out).  The character of the teenage daughter was very well written, however, very realistic.  Otherwise, this is just a formula Harlequin romance, and there are too many unrealistic situations in the story to make it a keeper.	2004-04-30

But it's a very slow-moving story, and it took its time to generate & hold my interest.  (I could easily put it down, and wasn't feeling enthused about picking it up again.)  The setting is different (Ireland, 1750's), and it started out well, but from that point, it was pretty sterotypical (repressed & resentful Irish and brutal English) and the basic love story and characterizations will remind you of other romances you've read (they certainly reminded me).  The author has some talent but I was underwhelmed by the staleness and dragging plot.<br /><br />Nice cover art.  That, and the back blurb, persuaded me to buy it, but the old adage \\"don't buy a book for its cover\\" lived up to its warning in this case.	2004-04-27

Its plot & pace are pure straight-arrow Regency.  There is NO tension between the hero & heroine.  Their one day together in Venice COULD have been \\"magical\\", but I had to infer that...I didn't believe it when the hero later says he fell in love with the heroine that day, although he SAID he did.<br /><br />I also thought the author made a major mistake by keeping the hero, Nicholas, off the scene too long, making him dangerously wounded and ill, thereby allowing the character of Daniel Tregarron to become more center-stage, doing everything the hero should have been doing.  Over time, the attraction between Daniel & Laura became irritating instead of intriguing, because I felt that the author was going to do a back-track & reconcile Nicholas and Laura.  And I was right.  And yet, I hadn't been able to get to know Nicholas, so why should I care about him and Laura finding their happiness?  It felt very phony to put them together at the end.<br /><br />Then, there is the extremely sudden & abrupt ending where Nicholas finally gets a clue, confesses his love to Laura and -- THAT's IT.  Just like an old Barbara Carland -- one kiss at THE END, and no follow through, no epilogue of a happy marriage, no - nothing!<br /><br />The quality of the writing is 'good' (particularly in the first chapters which take place in Venice) before the gothic-flavored melodrama kicks in.  Those first few chapters could rate 3 stars from me. But the old-fashioned, hands-off element between the main characters; the absence of the hero for 1/3 of the plot, and the corny & abruptly resolved happy ending, irretrievably damage this story.	2004-04-26

I picked this up fully expecting the same.  I WAS WRONG.  Nicola Cornick CAN write!  The heroine is believable, and the hero is too...These are strong characters in an excellent plot.  I don't really know why the ugly twist was thrown in toward the ending (won't give it away) but, it does bring resolution to the heroine's feelings regarding her mother.  I would have liked the heroine to tell off her father at the end (he was the one who rejected & hurt her emotionally all of her life), but the heroine's restraint toward him was indicative of the time period.  At least her father supported the heroine at the end - unbelievable in one way, after a lifetime of rejecting her, but, nice.  Oh, and the love story is completely believable; very tender & sweet.	2004-04-23

The time travel doesn't really hurt the way the story moves along, but it's not a necessary factor.  Ms. Heath does do a skillful job in describing the heroine's feelings as she goes back & forth.  But I think I would have enjoyed it more as straight Regency with the wrongfully manipulated heroine/trick-the-hero plot.  Ending kind of veers into melodrama, but that's the kind of plot it is.  This was my first time reading anything by this author and I do look forward to reading more of her work.  Even though this review isn't the strongest rave, I confirm that I enjoyed the author's storytelling ability and the tension between the hero and heroine.	2004-04-22

If I used a grading system like school, I'd probably give it a \\"C+\\".  The only way to describe this story is sweet, or nice.  There's no sexual tension between the hero & heroine.  It is a different Regency in that the hero is an escaped French prisoner of war, instead of a Duke who's secretly the chief of a spy ring; or a down-on-his luck Lordship looking for a rich wife; or someone like that.  But the story bogs down. The characters are well developed, their set up is interesting, but still... it's seriously lacking tension between the hero & heroine.  A just-good-enough read, but not a keeper.	2004-04-22
US	38889875	R38240FCB5WBUT	0440234859	64473411	Losing Julia	Books	3	2	9	N	N	Just about 3 stars	I had a hard time both reading, and finishing, this novel. And I am very interested in history; the Great War, and love stories...but this book just seemed false in all three areas from the get-go.  The characters never came alive.  They continued to behave like \\"novel\\" versions of real-life people.  Especially false, was the depiction of Patrick as an old man; especially the scene on the airplane back to France and his long winded conversations with the young lawyer.  Old people just don't talk that way in real life, not like Patrick did; they don't remember their struggles so keenly!  Another false thing was Patrick's brief infatuations/fixations on various women throughout the novel.  This especially didn't ring true since he was an 81 year old man dying of cancer.  An old man who's dying is concerned about keeping his dignity - not in keeping up elaborate, overly talkative flirtations with his nurse.<br /><br />This reader could tell the author was TRYING to write movingly; trying very hard to make you feel for these people, but it just didn't work, because the characters' situation; their lives, their choices, their inner lives as *real* persons, seemed so UNreal.  It was also very obvious that the author did a lot of research about the Great War but research alone doesn't bring a sense of reality to his depiction of the war and its effects afterward.  There are some varied passages in the book, which rise above the generally false-fiction aspect it has, and these passages grant it my 3-star rating.  But the story as a whole never adds up to one about believable characters who remain in your memory.  So glad I only borrowed this from my local library.	2004-04-21

But his unresolved feelings for her keep intruding on his wish for revenge.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite short Balogh novels.  The author got everything right in this story.  The hero and heroine are very well drawn; the tension between the two is palpable, and the hero's crisis of conscience is very believable.  The story unfolds at just the right pace, neither too quickly or too slowly.  Just a wonderful keeper, highly recommended.	2004-04-20
US	38889875	R3N82KW2WCZTDP	0804119856	405731316	The Lover	Books	3	13	17	N	N	JUST OK, not a great one	I have read & enjoyed Ms. Jordan's \\"The Seduction\\" but have generally found her other books lacking something or other.  When I bought this, I was not aware it was a rewrite, so I could approach it with a fresh view.<br />The love scenes are ample & steamy, and the plot is a good one.  But frankly, I was getting annoyed at what I felt was way too much emphasis on the hero's good looks, and heroine's supposed lack thereof (though this was really in her own mind).<br />The hero is also somewhat annoyingly full of himself (with his extraordinary good looks, romantic prowess & all)...it's a drawback to be annoyed with a supposedly irresistible hero. It was also irritating to continuously hear (through supporting characters) what a GREAT lover the hero is, known through the length & breadth of Europe.  Again, it was overload.  I wanted to yell, I know he's attractive & sexy, OK?  Leave it alone!<br /><br />I was also irritated near the end of the book, when Sabrina tells Niall, \\"I'm not your mouse, your tiger, your...\\" (whatever other nickname he had for her), but then on the next page, Niall calls her mouse, again!  At least four more times!  OK, he was just being affectionate, but didn't she just say she wasn't his mouse??<br /><br />Just harking back to \\"The Seduction\\", I thought this book read sort of a like a rough,rough draft of that plot, set in a different era.  Did anyone else feel that way?<br />Did I believe that Niall fell in love with Sabrina?  Well...sort of.  But not like I believed Damian fell for Vanessa in \\"The Seduction\\".  So, only 3 stars for \\"The Lover\\".	2004-04-20

I just have to disagree with the 3-star reviewer who said this was \\"not Balogh's best but still readable\\"...I put this book right up there with \\"A Temporary Wife\\" and it IS one of her best, absolutely!  Randolph & Eleanor have a difficult emotional time before they find happiness and that's REAL.  That's what makes this story so good - its characters' feelings are rooted in reality.  Following their arranged marriage, they have to learn about each other; more importantly they learn about themselves.  It makes their love story all the more satisfactory at the end.	2004-04-19

I was impressed with this novel because it can be read &amp; enjoyed by everyone, not just people who like to read Regency romances.  The quality was deeper than that -- this one has a really good story to tell, and it is well told!  Its themes are very well-written and explored, and the romance is very sweet &amp; grows slowly.

But I just didn't get that feeling.  It was an adequate story, but I didn't feel particularly enamored of any of the characters.  I was more annoyed by the heroine's fixation on the unobtainable Sebastian, and I wasn't necessarily convinced of her growing love for the hero, Evan.  Some parts of the story were humorous, but I was in no way touched or moved.  In short, a pleasant read, but no keeper.	2004-04-14

I thought it was kind of silly for the heroine to engage herself to a man she wasn't absolutely in love with, since she'd just turned the hero's proposal down because she realized the hero didn't love her.  But after considering it, and re-reading the story a few weeks later, I began to understand her reasons, and can recommend the book.  It began to make sense to me: the heroine felt that the man she engaged herself to, at least had affection for her, which the hero definitely did not when he proposed to her; her fiance's feelings were honest and affectionate, at least.  It was a gentle romantic feeling that promised to become more.  And then, the way the hero & heroine eventually began to fall in love with each other was perfectly written.  (Her refusal of the hero's proposal was actually his wake-up call!)  The subplots & the supporting characters are all well done, which really helps move the main story along, too.  Took a bit of considering, but I can recommend AN UNACCEPTABLE OFFER.	2004-04-13

Even the supporting cast is well-rounded.  It's basically the story of a man (David, Lord Helford) trying NOT to fall in love and trying to make a marriage of pure convenience, but he gets tripped up by his friends & family, who would like to see him happily wed to the heroine (Sophie Marsden).  A page-turner and sexy, too!  If you like Regencies with a little more to them, this is an excellent read.  So far, this is the author's best book.	2004-04-12

She's not an incompetent writer, but... this author just doesn't work wonders for me.  It's strange, because it's all there - the writing is good enough, and her historical details/research; it's her characters and the plots of her books that just don't hold my interest.  I can't escape a \\"been there/read that\\" feeling when I'm reading her work.  And I always have a hard time finishing her books!  This is the third one I've tried and I have to say, I'm giving her a a pass from now on.<br /><br />I also have to say I find her heroines somewhat childish or maybe the word is naive.  Or maybe it's the trouble they always seem to get themselves into.  The heroes are always a little more interesting in her works, than the heroines.	2004-04-12

The heroine is very stereotypical and superficial character.  These were stick-figures, not believeable characters.  The plot was as thin as a wafer.  There is no sexual tension whatsoever.

The book is extremely interesting when discussing the possible reasons behind Queen Anne's many tragical confinements; Queen Charlotte's very successful ones, and the historically tragic confinement of Princess Charlotte of Wales... right up to those of Queen Victoria.

I was surprised to realize that this novel is actually a later effort than the author's own &quot;The Scotsman&quot;.  At times, it reads like a first draft of an earlier work.  Some of the themes and motivations from &quot;The Scotsman&quot; are re-used and re-worked here, also.  Is the author losing her edge?<br />However, that's not to say it's bad.  Rob, the hero, the &quot;Laird&quot; of the title, is very strongly written and his characterization is perfect.  The plot certainly moves right along.  The heroine, I thought, could have been more individual.  She's not totally blah, but there is something less than special about her.  Unfortunately, while reading the novel, I kept thinking of her as Janet, not Judith which is her proper name.  When you can't remember a heroine's name while reading the book, that says something!<br />I also have to say that I thought the hero's losing ALL his brothers, while apparently a historical accuracy, was a bit much for a romance novel.  The hero's and his father's period of mourning, and the intense pain of such a loss, seemed too shortchanged.<br />I would still recommend the book, but I suggest the author's &quot;The Scotsman&quot; is the better novel. It contains many of the same themes &amp; conflicts and is clearly the better-edited novel.	2004-04-06

(really 2.5)	This is the kind of romance novel which, for me, is just good enough to keep me reading, but, I don't feel that I want to read it again and again, the way I do with my keepers.<br /><br />I thought there could have been more depth given to these characters and to their situation.  The hero, Joss's having African-American blood was a BIG deal in those days, after all.  I thought that discovery of this fact was too clumsily rushed into.  Then, BOOM, his grandfather dies - too suddenly - though it certainly moved the plot right along.  But WAY too fast.<br /><br />In fact, the whole book felt rushed.  The author rushes into the revelation about Joss, then rushed him into slavehood; rushed into a shipwreck; rushed the hero & heroine into making love...  I guess I wanted more sexual tension, more suspense.  It was an OK read but not as great as it could have been.  I thought the hero's heritage was a great plot twist, but it's just not used wisely enough.	2004-03-31

Ellen's complete innocence, her complete lack of self-esteem &amp; lack of any sense of how to protect herself, made me want to kick her.  Taylor Caldwell could write so well but some of her books' elements (plot twists) fall into the category of soap opera, and unfortunately this is one of her worst.  It tried so hard to be serious &amp; full of warnings, trying to hammer home the message, so that it basically imploded on itself.  I couldn't feel any sadness for Ellen; I was too busy wishing she'd get a backbone.  Of course if she'd had a backbone there would have been no story, but let me say it was a chore to get through this one.	2004-03-29

I wish I knew what it is about Balogh, that I can only enjoy her shorter Signet Regency novels (Tempting Harriet, The Temporary Wife, etc.), but when I try to read her longer works (the \\"Slightly\\" series, etc.) she falls flat (for me).  This is one of her longer romances (although still a Signet Regency), and I didn't like it.<br /><br />I thought Fleur's disgust and fear of Adam, while completely understandable given their first encounter, was carried on by the author for too long, and thus I never believed Fleur's falling into love/sexual attraction to Adam at the end.  I never felt Fleur took off as a fully developed female character, she remained very bland and dull to me.  I also felt Adam should have been more take-charge with his wife, and there should have been a scene of him kicking his brother's ass.  And come on, the five, count 'em five, scenes where Adam keeps offering to call another doctor for his obviously consumptive wife, and she keeps refusing - it would have made me admire him more if he had just brought the damn dr. to her, instead of constantly asking if she wanted him to!!!  Couldn't Adam have at least given his brother a good strong verbal put-down, if not a strong right hook?  No, Adam just lets his brother sleep with his wife and never reproaches either of them...he \\"understands\\"!  Aaagh!<br /><br />All in all, pretty disappointed with this.	2004-03-26

Woodiwiss's best novel	I find that most Kathleen Woodiwiss romances are extremely over-written, with way too much detail, and plots that crawl along slooooowly.  The worst sin of all, they don't have enough romantic scenes.  But, in its defense, SHANNA, although chock-full of detail, doesn't grind to a halt like most of the plots of Ms. Woodiwiss's later books, and is probably still her best novel.  I read it about 10 years ago and re-read it recently, and it is still enjoyable, which is more than you can say for many 1970's/'80's-era romance novels.<br /><br />SHANNA is a wee bit draggy, and the prose is a bit lavender-shaded, and toward the end Shanna's lack of a clue about Ruark's identity is stretched to the breaking point.  Did she need to be hit over the head with his true identity or what?  Yet on the plus side, the characters of Ruark & Shanna and the supporting cast are well drawn and keep the story moving.  Shanna, while \\"bratty\\" to begin with, and annoying due to her hard-heartedness toward Ruark at first, matures during the story and finally grew on me.  {You could put her bratty behavior down to the fact that she was motherless, and that her father spoiled her.}  And Ruark is a lovely hero - a perfect mixture of intelligence and good looks, who really loves Shanna from the beginning.  This is so nice, because so many older novels kept the heroes from feeling or admitting their love to the heroines - it's a real drawback that spoils many a good older story.  I would still recommend \\"Shanna\\" above all other Kathleen Woodiwiss novels.	2004-03-19

Everything was right in place; the characters are well-drawn, the plot is good, but somehow... the story and the characters don't come to life.<br /><br />Let me praise the author by stating that the writing and her research into the period is a cut above the usual Harlequin Historical standard, but this is not a superlative novel.

I thought the book really took off when Saint realized that there was absolutely no one in his world who cared about his disappearance.  Also, I loved the \\"scene\\" when he & Evie finally had their first time.  (It's not a book filled with such scenes, I think the other reviewer counted 2 and that's accurate.)<br /><br />BUT, I have to agree with other reviewer(s) who said that Saint's almost constant propositioning of Evie from the first instant of their meeting, was very off-putting.  (I know, he's a bad boy, but still, it's yuccky that he constantly propositions her, and she's an innocent woman besides.)  Evie's family, brother Victor particularly, needed a comeuppance at the end.  I strongly feel that Evie needed more backbone instead of wishbone during the course of this story.  Still, it was basically well-written; had good light moments, and a hero who grew on me - slowly, it must be admitted; but eventually he did.  If only the heroine could have.  Ultimately, her weaknesses really blighted the story for me.	2004-03-01

I was a fan of \\"To Marry The Duke\\" (you can read my review on its page on Amazon) but THIS was a big comedown.  In the first place, Clara and Seger (and how do I pronounce that name anyway?) were just ciphers...they weren't fully-drawn, well-rounded characters.  We keep hearing how handsome Seger is -- enough already, after the tenth description of his blond hair, dimpled chin and huge hands (and guess what THAT means, ladies.)  I think the author had to keep going on about his good looks in order to give him SOMETHING as a character, since he has no depth whatsoever.<br /><br />Secondly, Clara, is just a nothing heroine; she's nowhere near as interesting as her sister Sophia was (and in this book, Sophia is as dully written as Clara).  Even NOT comparing this book to To Marry The Duke, it's really pretty poor.  I think the five-star reviewers must have been carried away by the sex scenes, and they are pretty potent I'll admit, but for me, this novel had NO plot that was worth telling, NO characters worth remembering, nor enough interest to keep me turning the pages...When Seger began to write letters to Clara, I thought, at last, a really interesting plot turn.  What a different plot device for these characters; we'll start to learn something about Seger's past; the characters will begin to KNOW each other by exchanging letters...and then, THAT device was blown, because ALL the letters contain are Seger's offers of discreet sexual encounters!  Will ya or won't ya, basically.  Then, we're supposed to be moved because he makes the effort to redeem himself and pays a respectable call on Clara after writing these offers to her.  But this is all so blandly written, you can't be moved by Seger's effort.  These are cardboard characters in a boring, draggy plot.<br /><br />Jeez, this book was a real disappointment after To Marry The Duke.  I am really bummed out by how bad this book was, because I was looking forward to it!  Despite this bad review, I will probably buy Adele's story just to see what happens, but now I will definitely wait for a \\"used\\" version.te this bad review, I will probably buy Adele's story just to see what happens, but now I will definitely wait for a \\"used\\" version.	2004-02-23

But I'm going to try to be fair here.  I thought I would read something by Ms. Holt since I had never read anything by her before, and I was looking for a new romance author.  The two stars I grant Complete Abandon might actually be a 2.5.  This is not a badly written book -- its story moves along, and it's not boring (though I found myself skimming toward the end, I must admit).<br /><br />I've discovered that the type of writing/character development/plot devices chosen by this author are not my preference in romance fiction.  Ms. Holt reminded me a little of Bertice Small's older novels, which is good as far as that goes, (she's certainly very, um, direct, like Bertice, with a touch of perversity) but nowadays I generally prefer a little subtlety in my romance reading.  So the hero's oversexed \\"cockstands\\" (yes, that's what she calls 'em), and the immediately horny heroine, kind of put me off.  It all seems so smutty - but that's my opinion, it might not be yours!  If you prefer your romance reading very \\"up front\\", with a touch of perversity (in this book, the Vicar with the taste for little girls comes to mind --uggh.) then Cheryl Holt is the author for you.  Ms. Holt just isn't one that I prefer.	2004-02-17
US	38889875	R2SKFNHCHG3UM1	0399151729	162118562	A Royal Duty	Books	2	19	24	N	N	I think Paul Burrell is a bit nutty.	I liked some of this book -- for example, when Burrell goes into detail and describes what it was like to be a servant in the Queen's Household.  But then, he went to work for Charles & Diana, and I frankly think he lost his mind, a little.  My personal opinion is that he had a romantic fixation on Diana (and still does), which prevents him from being rational and balanced.  You can just sense, as the book goes on, that he's losing his grip.  It's not like he's out & out crazy, but she drew him into her own half-baked way of dealing with her problems, and he's still there even though she's gone.  Also, his trial was a drawn out fiasco, which obviously took its toll on his personality and his thought process.  That's why I give the book 2 stars:  I truly think it was written by a person who is not dealing with reality.  He's still seeing everything and everyone connected with Diana, through Diana's POV, and his own stressed-out, wounded POV, which does not a rational human being make.	2004-02-13

Just state my feelings after reading this story.  All the other Amazon.com reviews here were so superlative (and convinced me to buy this), but honestly I didn't think this story was as great as the others said.  It's a solid 3-star effort for the writing, but the substituted bride element is not, as romance-novel-creativity goes, a particularly memorable one.  It's been done before.  The book didn't make me experience a \\"richly emotional\\" payoff, as the professional review would put it.  I thought Adam was behaving like a jerk toward Madeline, and this behavior toward her goes on for a length of time, until he starts being physically attracted to her.  A pleasant-enough romantic read by the end, but unfortunately not a keeper for me.	2004-02-13

It is well-written, sympathetic to the subject, yet fair.  You learn that Frances was the warm-hearted child of a reserved mother and an affectionate father; just a very nice, somewhat emotionally insecure girl, who unfortunately made the mistake of marrying the wrong man (The Earl Spencer), and has basically had to pay for that mistake, for her whole life.<br /><br />Some of the mistakes of her own upbringing were repeated by her with her children, to the greater detriment of her two younger children.  However, it could be be said that a major part of the damage done to Diana and to Charles Spencer occurred because Frances lost custody thanks to her mother & The Earl Spencer's machinations, and the mores of the time.  She was sidelined as a mother, both by this failed custody action and because she removed herself from England with her new husband, seeking a new beginning.  The failed custody action and what Frances' mother did  caused an unhealed breach in family relations which seems to remain unresolved to this day.<br /><br />It's good to read \\"her side\\", after hearing so much gossipy garbage about how she \\"bolted\\" from Diana's father for another man, and learning the real reasons behind her decision.  Also, Paul Burrell's recent book portrays Frances SO badly (and I believe most unfairly).  Frances deserved the chance to tell her version of events and in Max Riddington she found the means to do so.  It's well done, interesting, and a must-read for those who want to hear ALL sides of the story of Frances, and to understand the character of Diana, Princess of Wales a little better too.	2004-02-13

BUT, having said that, I always think any novel in a \\"series\\" should be able to stand on its own.  This book bored me with a long winded, draggy plot.

The first part of the book, when Aline the aristocrat and John McKenna the poor stableboy, are first falling in love, is wonderful.  I thought I was really in for a treat.  But after McKenna gets turned away and goes to the United States for twelve years, the story kind of fell apart (for me).  I thought the pushy Americans in this book belonged to the next generation, the \\"Gilded Age\\" of the 1880's, as opposed to the 1840's when the book was set.  I didn't like the fact that Aline immediately thought McKenna would never accept the burns on her legs.  After hearing her think about how he's her other half; her soulmate, etc., I thought it might have been more believable if maybe her arms or torso had been burned too; then you could see how extremely reluctant she would be to expose herself to him.  As with other reviewers, I thought she was being prideful, maybe selfish.  I also thought the story of Aline and McKenna and the resolution of their dilemma became kind of -- draggy, drawn out.  I found myself liking the characters and subplot of Gideon and  Livia, because they kept the book moving along!<br /><br />This was one of those books, while I was reading it, I kept thinking, \\"this could have been different\\" or, \\"this could have been done better\\".  But I did strongly like the first few chapters, the ones that outlined Aline & McKenna's young love, and for the chapters involving Livia & Gideon.  And also for the fact that the hero, McKenna, was made so tender & loving as to cry when Aline turned down his marriage proposal.  That's something you don't read too often in these romance novels.  It might sound 'weak' to hear about a romance hero crying, but the scene is very beautifully written and I applaud Lisa Kleypas for it.	2004-02-09

I used to like Kathleen Woodiwiss, when I was 15 and first read \\"Shanna\\", which I consider the best of her books, but, unfortunately, the rest of her novels in my opinion truly stink.  They are way too clogged with superfluous detail upon detail, and thus take forever to read.  Plots are spelled out in excruciating detail, & drag on and on with descriptions of EVERYTHING:  the food, the drink, appearances of rooms, etc., before you actually get to any one character's motivations and/or emotions, not to mention any interaction between characters -- there is so little interaction that her books just stop dead.  The reader is kept too busy reading the overly descriptive, boring bits before you even hit anyone having a conversation!  Ms. Woodiwiss really needs to cut out the fat and write a romance novel that hums along, not drags its feet.<br /><br />Having now ranted about her books in general - SO WORTHY MY LOVE was particularly AND badly affected by these qualities, and thus, for me, it dragged on and on, I found myself skipping forward in a desperate effort to find out if the story was actually MOVING somewhere, toward an involving, satisfying and romantically emotional situation.  But it never did.  What a snooze.	2004-01-23

I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought Isabella's romance with Owen was a sudden occurance with no development.  Although I wished she could have ended up with Thomas, Owen made a worthy substitute and there was a bit of foreshadowing in his appearance as her lover.  I thought there was adequate development of their romance and I liked the emphasis on Isabella's &quot;new beginning&quot;.  I recommend this book HIGHLY.

I had, however, never read anything by Claudia Dain; I liked the look of the cover art, & the plot blurb on the back cover sounded intriguing...stupid me!  Don't buy a book by its cover!!  It's not that it's so badly written, but with the heroine having her period throughout the whole book (just about)...what a plot device!  There's the hero's impatience to consummate the marriage, and then when her father reveals his true nature...in somewhat graphic detail...Ewww!  My one-star is for a moving passage about 10 pages from the end of the book, when the heroine questions why God didn't save her from her father's attentions, and the hero responds about Christ having suffered horribly, why should his servants suffer less?  I've just messed up the quote, but I think that's what the author wanted to convey all along but she couldn't get that across until the end (maybe).  Anyway the rest of this book was really kind of gross.  Avoid at all costs.	2004-01-02

I have to say that the others were just average short romance stories, with \\"Puddings, Pastries and Thou\\" being slightly better than average.  The prize for worst plot goes to Claudia Dain's \\"Union\\".  It's not badly written but the heroine's (self-induced) dilemma was silly.

The historical period is one of my favorites (Victorian England, late 1800's, \\"Gilded-era\\" arranged marriages) so I enjoyed this story very much.<br /><br />Although the character development, and the plotting toward the end was a little  shaky (I don't know how else to describe it), and maybe the conclusion felt a little rushed and not quite in keeping with the rest of the book, I've got to give this 4 stars & recommend it.  The author has done her homework on the era, so if Sophia seemed a tad too modern to me in her manners, I was able to accept it. The hero James was complex & yet loveable and sympathetic, once Sophia was able to break through his barriers.	2003-10-22

It's not as bad as the one-star reviewer would have you believe, but in my opinion, it's not as good as the 4 &amp; 5 stars would say.  I love some of the characters -- Angela is a fine heroine; the old grandfather; Tibby the housekeeper.  Lucius was a difficult hero to admire; I have to sort of agree with the one-star reviewer about his mask, but the author made me understand the paranoia about his scarred face that was behind his wearing it.  The book just fell flat somewhere for me.  I thought the book went on too long, that's it; some nonsense about Lucius trying to get Angela to love the vicar instead was just that: nonsense.  So I have to give it a solid 3 1/2 stars for the mostly well-plotted writing, &amp; some characterizations, but in the end, it's not a keeper for me.	2003-10-15

The characters are so well-developed & involving.  The detail in the book is fantastic; it's not some run-of-the-mill romance novel.  It's much better than that.  The heroine, Ema is a fascinating character, rising from the lowest depths (emotionally and financially) to being a woman of power. It was a pretty believable rise, too.  All the novel's characters are well rounded, interesting people.  Also, the author paid a great deal of attention to getting the time period details (1914-1962), just right.  I really hated to have the story end.	2003-10-09

I bought this book on the strength of Amazon.com's readers &amp; reviewers (all Five or Four stars with the exception of one Three star) and I must say, I was let down.  I found that the characters and/or the plot had nothing new to say; were in fact drawn as rather ordinary stock-romance-novel figures, (particularly the evil Dom, although I appreciated Ms. St. John's attempt to give him depth by flashing back to the episode of his father killing the puppy).  The praise given for the character of Isabel was way out of league -- frankly I thought she was a bit dull for a heroine.  I thought the attraction between the hero &amp; heroine felt rushed; there was no sexual tension.  I agree with the 3-star reviewer who said this is a good read -- it IS; but it just isn't superlative, 5-star writing like the other reviewers said it was, and certainly no keeper for me.	2003-10-07

I could not believe any woman would forgive that kind of behavior, let alone fall in love with the hero after it.  The author tries to fob off the blackmail toward the end, by having the hero admit he was \\"forced\\" into this behavior, because the heroine turned him down on dates for a year -- HOW WEAK!  He couldn't take her rejection so he decided to blackmail her into bed. UGH. This book is no romance, it's just plain disgusting.  Avoid at all costs.	2003-09-26

I struggled to finish it.<br /><br />Better books for insight into Alexandra are:  \\"Purple Secret\\" by John Rohl, et al. for its chapter on Alexandra's complex medical history; Robert Massie's \\"Nicholas & Alexandra\\" for its sympathetic understanding of Alix's traumatic childhood loss of her mother, and what it's like to be the parent of a hemophiliac (this despite Massie's inaccuracies, such as stating that Queen Victoria was strongly in favor of the marriage of Nicky & Alix and that she tried to talk Alix into it, when in fact she dreaded it), and, oddly enough, a biography of Alix's mother: \\"Princess Alice\\" by Gerard Noel, which gives excellent insight into Alix's parents and German background.  Also, \\"Advice to My Granddaughter\\" a collection of letters between Queen Victoria and Alix's oldest sister, Princess Victoria of Battenberg.  There is also: \\"A Lifelong Passion\\", a collection of letters between & diaries of Nicholas & Alexandra, and the relatives around them. Any one of these has more value than Erickson's book.  I have not read Greg King's biography of Alexandra (to date) so cannot comment on it.<br /><br />I've enjoyed Erickson's Tudor biographies, so I'm trying to be fair, but this biography didn't cut it.

The heroine, Isolde, is a little less well-drawn (she's a little shallow intially, and spoiled) but not totally to the detriment of the story.  She matures and changes too, although not so drastically as Rhys does.  I liked the fact that the story is centered around the changes that the two individuals, Rhys and Isolde, are undergoing.  The author's spotlight on the two characters; their inner thoughts and doubts, etc., makes the love story that much stronger.  It's a very sensual romance, also --always a good thing!	2003-06-05

The author was so adoring of Otto Frank, despite presenting information about his cold-heartedly arranged marriage to his wife, Edith, and his company's dealings with the Germans (for which he was blackmailed later).  It became annoying to read.  Sure, Otto deserves our deepest sympathy for all he suffered and lost.  And he wasn't the scum that his blackmailer was.  But he was not a saint &amp; this author is not just in her presentation.  She completely blurs over the fact that he married his first wife for her money &amp; made her fairly miserable by never being able to love her (or even offer her a reasonable facsimile of love).  This to me is a real failing in his character.  And what about Otto's agreeing with the schmaltzing up and dumbing down of the Franks' experience in that rotten '50's play &amp; film.  Yes, I know he wanted to reach as many people as possible but for God's sake set some limits.  I don't think the author has enough distance from her subject to do him justice-- she was too emotional about him, with too much sympathy for him, thus cannot give us a warts &amp; all view of his life.  It IS possible that there were people who suffered in concentration camps --while not deserving that experience-- who were not super-fine people!!  I would have preferred more acceptance of Otto's faults from the author, instead of trying to brush them aside in her haste to make us understand what a &quot;fine, sensitive, loving (words used over &amp; over) man&quot; he was.	2003-05-27

The author presents information about his upbringing that tries to make you feel a little sympathy for Donahue but it's hard to feel sympathy for such a loser.  The Duke & Duchess of Windsor were wastes of human beings, too.  The more you read about them the more discouraged you get.  What wasted opportunities!  They could have done so much good but were such selfish, self-centered & STUPID people.  No wonder the Royal Family can't stand to hear their names mentioned.

The first time I read it, I thought it was good, but not 5-star great.  I liked it enough to hold on to it, however, and as time passed, this story really grew on me.  Mia and Alex really seem to despise each other at the beginning of their marriage, but have a mad passionate relationship in bed, which reflects their true feelings underneath all the distrust.  The growing tenderness of Alex toward Mia is nicely done (he falls in love with Mia without even knowing it), as is Mia's need for that tenderness.  Mia's father is a slimy supporting character, who the author makes sure gets a comeuppance that really hurts.  There are some nice surprise/twists in the plot that keep things moving.<br /><br />Having since read more of Michelle Reid's work I would say this particular story is one of her best.	2003-05-22

That was a plus.  The writer's skill made me want to finish this to see how it ended, and that's why I gave it the two stars.  But on the negative side, the plot was SO unrealistic.  I hated the hero (so selfish & self-absorbed), and I thought the heroine was just a big wimp.  The author tries to explain away the hero's attraction to the heroine (while he's married to another woman) in an \\"Author's Note\\" at the beginning of the book, but I definitely felt it was a betrayal; no smart writing could get around this.<br /><br />As said above, there was nothing particularly believable about the plot, and a confident, non-doormat of a woman (which the heroine isn't) would have told the hero to pack it up the minute he asked her to get an abortion, or would have left him herself.  Instead, she hangs around so patiently and silently during her pregnancy, hoping he'll change his mind!!??  Ridiculous.	2003-04-16

FREE LAND is a fine novel that disproves that theory.  The author mingles various facts about her parents and her grandparents and creates a compelling story of people homesteading in the late 1870's.  This doesn't make her a lesser writer; it makes her imaginative and creative.  Haven't many famous authors taken stories from their family's past and created great fiction?<br /><br />Rose Wilder Lane is a very underappreciated author, and is today better remembered as the daughter of Laura Ingalls Wilder. The temptation is to try to compare RWL's writing to her mother's Little House books, and to expect her writing to be like Laura's:  don't do it!

I read it first in the early '80's, never forgot it, and luckily found another copy in a used book store...it will never leave my bookshelf again.  It's not a nice, gentle romance - it's action-filled and rough at times, but that's what makes it such a good read.<br /><br />I liked the fact that the author let Brandon and Juliette fall in love before they knew the truth about each other - which makes their falling out (and their semi-hatred for each other) that much more painful for them.	2003-02-12

Unfortunately I thought The Stranger from the Sea was a weak beginning in terms of its plot; I also formed a negative impression of several new characters, such as Stephen Carrington, and the Kellow family, for example, which affected my total enjoyment of the continued series, but I did think each succeeding book became stronger.  I thought The Twisted Sword concluded the series, and the younger generations' stories, very well, if sadly.<br /><br />BELLA POLDARK for me was a turn-back to the disappointment of The Stranger from the Sea:  a clunky and cluttered plot peopled with somewhat familiar-but-remote older characters who didn't seem to bear any relation to the Ross, Demelza, George, Dwight and Caroline, et al. that I had known.  Of course they WERE older so one expects change, but what these older characters lacked was the spark of life that Mr. Graham had so successfully given them, the spark that made them so real.<br /><br />Then there are the odd-ball characters that populate this final story:  Philip Prideaux; Christopher Harvegal, the Kellow family, most especially Paul Kellow who certainly made a 90 degree turn from the minor character he was in the previous novels... If The Twisted Sword was a sad book in some respects BELLA POLDARK is a somewhat gruesome one in terms of the Jack-the-Ripper-ish subplot, which to me sticks out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />Each Poldark daughter has two suitors to choose from.  I admit to some pleasure in the fact that Clowance finally chooses well, but Bella's romances were tedious.  It was another disappointment to me that Bella was allowed to have a physical affair with her second suitor; a suitor who seemed to be created just to give her relationship with Christopher the edge and conflict it was lacking.  (Mr. Graham never went much beyond the bedroom door before in the Poldark series so it was also jarring to read the brief description of Bella's seduction.)  And Ross - behaving so gently when his daughter elopes, and after finding out about her affair?<br /><br />The character of Valentine Warleggan was, for me, re-developed from previous books in a most unsatisfactory way - half almost-criminal; half lost soul.  The quiet scene with Ross in The Twisted Sword when Valentine finally questions Ross about his parentage was vintage Winston Graham:  sparingly emotional and resolute.  In BELLA POLDARK, I didn't hate the fact that Valentine wanted to draw closer to his natural father, and that he'd been damaged by Warleggan's attitude to him in his childhood.  But we are told this several times (another disappointment - it was both show AND tell).  Finally, I just didn't like the highly emotional, melodramatic final twist that occurs in \\"resolving\\" the character and story of Valentine.<br /><br />For the first time in reading a Poldark novel, I felt that briefly-encountered older supporting characters such as Sam Carne, Ben Carter, and Jud Paynter, and new subcharacters such as Esther the niece of Demelza, were now \\"quaint\\", or, little bits of undeveloped (or recycled) characters.<br /><br />Is this a readable book?  Well yes it is, I don't think a good novelist of 70+ years experience is going to produce something totally un-readable - it's mostly as a Poldark book that I find it so lost, and weakly plotted in most respects.<br /><br />I still highly recommend the first eight novels of the series, \\"Ross Poldark\\" through \\"The Angry Tide\\".

I didn't find Merry or Nic appealing at all, as characters.  Conversations that took place between them and all the book's other characters sounded fake or false.  A romance novel has to have admirable characters and be held together by a good plot.  This one was kind of all over the place, plot-wise and character-wise.  Frankly I wonder if this was kind of rushed into print as a semi-sequel to Beyond Innocence, as Merry was a subcharacter in that novel?  But in any case, the story did not appeal to me and it's a subpar effort from Emma Holly.	2003-01-15

The writing is good, a little hero-worshiping of Diana comes through, but that's tolerable.  I notice the author only interviewed some of the more wacko or cheeseball \\"friends\\" of Diana (Simone Simmons, the faith healer, taken seriously?? but I guess Diana took her seriously at one time).  However, at least you learn more about Hasnat Khan & his background (sounds like a really nice person, and all his family too).  I can't agree with the author that Diana was a stronger person at the end of her life -- she seemed to me to be very immature still.  Imagine taking up with Dodi Fayed to make another man jealous, sure he was a multi-millioniare but please, the guy had had so many women (what did he tell Diana about his fiance, Kelly Fisher??), and there was his drug habit...I wouldn't touch him with a barge pole.  That's mature, strong behavior on Diana's part?  I think she was so devastated when Dr. Khan finally broke it off, that she went into a tailspin & into her old, self-destructive, immature behavior.  Manipulative, too, if you believe that she planned for the \\"Kiss\\" picture and the others being taken (which I believe).  The author doesn't agree with my thoughts, but she doesn't force the issue, she just mentions that other friends thought Diana sounded strong at what turned out to be the end of her life.  It's an interesting book, not the best one on Diana, but thoughtful and brings out some unknown background on her relationship with Hasnat Khan.	2003-01-15

I'm in the minority that didn't think the stories of their children needed to be told.  But, even given that feeling, THE STRANGER FROM THE SEA is a pretty poor first follow-up.  (The Miller's Dance and The Twisted Sword are stronger novels, but I nearly didn't read them after being so disappointed with this book.)  And I still wish I'd stopped reading this saga with \\"The Angry Tide\\" and not given in to the temptation to see what was going to happen to the children of Ross, Demelza and George.<br /><br />In THE STRANGER FROM THE SEA, I found myself taking a particular dislike to the character of Stephen Carrington - I could not see in any way how Clowance would ever be attracted to him.  His personality was arrogant; nothing about his circumstances made him believable, and the reader could sense that he was a liar from the beginning.  To me, Stephen was an irritant.  Jeremy and Cuby's story was more interesting, but their romance is something of a repeat of the old love/conflict of Ross and Elizabeth in some respects.  I liked Jeremy more as his story is continued in the further sequels, but from the start of STRANGER, I never grasped Clowance's character or what attracted so many men to her.  It was as if Mr. Graham was trying to create a Demelza for the younger generation, but for me Clowance just didn't work, even as a pale copy of Demelza.  I admit that Clowance's senseless attraction to the worthless Stephen colors my opinion of her.  It starts her off badly, like a racehorse that stumbles out of the box.<br /><br />In common with many another multi-generational and multi-charactered family saga, a strain of repetition and less fascinating characters than those in previous books becomes evident - this is strongly apparent in THE STRANGER FROM THE SEA.	2003-01-14

Note:  Caroline doesn't become Ben's mistress, and they don't really have an affair, so the title is a bit of a puzzle.  (Most Harlequin titles are pretty bad, anyway.)<br /><br />The author successfully convinced me that these two meant so much to each other, and that it damaged them both, when they were nefariously broken apart as teenagers.  It's very romantic that they could never forget each other.  Caroline is weak in the knees for Ben, but is not a weak woman like too many Harlequin heroines.  And Ben is not (for once!) a typical alpha-hero, taking over every aspect of the heroine's life.

(\\"It had not really been a rape, yet in a way it had been.\\")  It is most certainly rape, and Anna remains preyed upon by the sick monster afterward -- which, to me, is not good reading.  Something else I didn't understand:  even if Anna thought that confessing what happened to her could permanently rend her marriage with Luke - why NOT confess it to him, the morning after their first night?  These two people hadn't made a happy love match, it was a marriage made for other reasons, so why not get everything out in the open?  (But then if she had, there wouldn't have been 200+ more pages to this story.)<br /><br />In all other respects, this story is a fairly routine 'Balogh' romance.  Luke's fancy clothing and rouge didn't bother me (although I admit it's strange for a romance hero to carry a fan, 1750 or not), but other things did.  Such as, all the usual characteristics of Balogh's writing being present:  the hero who's been emotionally rejected by his family and thus rejects them, but is reluctantly pulled back into the family circle by circumstances beyond his control; a \\"marriage of convenience\\" with well-concealed emotions but strong sexual feelings between the protagonists; romantic little scenes involving sibling subcharacters which are dropped in as setups for future books...  Sometimes these things work beautifully in her short fiction, but personally I've never been \\"gripped\\" by any of Mary Balogh's longer work.  There's nothing fresh here; nothing you haven't read in many of Mary Balogh's books before.<br /><br />But it's mostly due to that disturbing twist regarding Anna's abuse, and the author's presentation of it, that I can't really recommend HEARTLESS, except to the die-hard Balogh fan.	2002-10-21

I need not say more than those two words, but I will -- this book is just awful.  I was expecting a real memoir, and this is just a piecemeal collection of boring anecdotes and pats on the back, combined with crabbiness about modern life.  Dreadful!

Kennedy, Jr.	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A different look at JFK Jr.	I liked this book, because firstly, the author had such a different, new point of view to write from.  What would it be like to work for a famous, rich, beloved & handsome scion of a family the whole world knows about?  This author tells us.  There are times in this book when you could tell that the author wished he could have been closer with JFK Jr., but he remained, when all was said and done, Jr.'s employee.  To me, it seems that Jr. did a good job of fitting people into different compartments of his life, and the author was definitely fit into \\"Employee - Not a Friend\\".<br /><br />Sometimes, too, the book can read almost as if the author had a little too much admiration for JFK Jr.  But then he'd get into some of the difficult areas of Jr.'s life -- like Jr.'s rancid defense of his \\"poster-boy\\" cousins -- and a more balanced POV would emerge and the star buzz the author felt from being around JFK Jr. would deplete.  I've read reviews that said the author was catty about Jr.'s wife Carolyn, and also about his sister Caroline, but I didn't he was being catty.  He was just relaying what he saw and experienced as someone who was somewhat close, but not too close, to these individuals.  And, generally speaking, he was seeing them with unbiased, un-Kennedy-worshipping eyes.<br /><br />All in all, I think the author did a good job in reporting what he saw and what he knew, and although he had a clear affection for JFK Jr., it doesn't slant the book into worshipping-the-wonderful-Kennedys territory.	2002-09-17

I've read &amp; enjoyed many Rosemary Rogers novels before, but this one was boring from the first few pages.  I had to force myself to finish it. The plot was basically a re-tread of scenes from her prior novels, and none of the characters were particularly likeable or involving. Nothing new or fresh here.	2002-09-17

She had devoted herself to her work, so that when the opportunity for love presented itself, she just didn't know how to deal with it.  That seemed \\"real\\" enough.  I did like the author's depiction of Draco, and the way he treated Cressy when they first made love, in Greece, was perfect.	2002-09-13

Some of the turns of phrase she incorporated were just too \\"today\\".  Also, there were longish stretches in the story that were somewhat boring and I found myself \\"skimming\\".  I found the plot pretty unrealistic (even for a romance novel).  Only the will to find out what would become of Katherine and Alain, who remained interesting characters, drove me on.  But this was definitely not a keeper for me.  If you're a die-hard fan of this author, get it, but if not, wait for the bargain bin.	2002-07-22

It's the kind of book that's so well-written, you can start reading it from any chapter and get hooked. I don't think you have to be a Royalty-fan to enjoy it. Queen Mary was a fascinating person & her life was so interesting, to say the least.  It's got so much detail, and the author makes you understand the circumstances which made Queen Mary the person she was.  This book was published in 1957, which was only a few years after her death and a more reticent time, so don't expect any delving into Queen Mary's unfortunate habit of \\"guilting\\" people into giving her their historical knicknacks, etc. for her vast collections. (Or about her shady dealings in the matter of acquiring Empress Marie of Russia's jewel collection from the Empress' daughters at a bargain price.)  For the Royal buff, there is also a wealth of information on Queen Victoria, Edward VII, Alexandra,et al.  Make this a cornerstone of your Royalty (or just good biography) collection & you won't be disappointed.	2002-07-12

I've read this book, and the writing is fine and the pictures are beautiful, BUT, the author spoils the end with his final chapter, reiterating his strongly held belief that Anna Anderson was the Grand Dutchess Anastasia, which to me is just a stupid belief.  No one got out of that charnel house that was Ekaterinburg.  This last chapter just has no place in this book (he's already written about a whole book about it, anyway) and it spoils the book for me.  But this is purely a personal opinion and the rest of the book is very good; especially juxtaposing certain photographs of various palaces, etc. with their present-day appearance.	2002-07-12

The author really made the time period come alive.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the life of Henry VII; the Wars of the Roses and just English history in general.  By the way, it's not a \\"trashy\\" novel, so for those of you looking for romance/historical, this one's not.  But it's very interesting and well-written novel about the early life of Henry VII, and the machinations that brought him to the throne of England.	2002-07-01

I didn't find it mawkish at all.  It's about tenderness, so maybe that's why the other reviewer thought it was \\"mawkish\\".  Don't look for sensationalism here, this novel is about how two people from different worlds fall in love.  It's really superb.	2002-06-17

It's very flowing and lyrical; I'd never read anything by her before.  It's a very fine historical novel. I was only a little disappointed at times with the character of Owen Tudor, who was a selfish bastard (per the author's characterization), but that only made the novel more realistic.  Putting aside my strictly personal disappointment with aspects of Owen's character, it is the growing love story between Owen Tudor and Princess Katherine, and the tender description of her marriage to Henry V, which are wonderfully realized and well-written.  Why isn't this novel still in print??  It deserves to be!	2002-06-17

I first read it around 1985 or so and I never forgot it, and luckily it remained on my bookshelf.  The absorbing plot has everything you want in a romance novel, the author grabs you instantly with her tale of the two warring Scottish clans with years & years of hatred between them.  It's a Romeo-Juliet love story (which is heavily sensual); there are evil subcharacters who come between the lovers; periods of betrayal and reconciliation, and, as a nice bonus, a secondary romance for the hero's foster brother!<br /><br />For me this book was a full, fantastic read, and I always thought this book was the author's best.  I highly recommend it for romance readers who want something totally different; something totally out-of-the-box, from what is being publishing today.	2002-05-29

However, I gave it three stars because I prefer &quot;Vicky&quot; by Daphne Bennett, which is out of print but much more symphathetic to its subject.  Ms. Pakula is a little harsh in her judgments.  Neither book explores Vicky's health problems, which are set forth in John Rohl's (et al.) &quot;Purple Secret&quot;, containing an excellent chapter on Vicky.  All three books should be read for a complete understanding of her personality.	2002-05-24

After reading so much \\"trash\\" about Mrs. Roosevelt and her friendships, this book is revealing without delving into smutty, unproveable theories.  It provided a lot of personal information about Eleanor Roosevelt's last years, public and private, as well as valuable insights about her complex personality.  On occasion, the author's somewhat proprietary feelings toward her connection with Mrs. Roosevelt were in evidence, but on the whole, it is a memoir that no one with an interest in Eleanor Roosevelt should miss.	2002-05-24

It's a flat retelling of the life, with no particular insight into what made Alice so interesting.  In particular, I found Vickers' use of footnotes (actually, asteriks), on nearly every page, a very annoying distraction.  Sometimes, very interesting information is contained in these \\"*'s\\" -- but WHY did he choose that way of working this information into the biography?<br /><br />Vickers presents Alice's religious preoccupation (which was a major factor in her later life and how she lived it) as basicially just something \\"kooky\\" about her, almost as if Vickers' prejudices were coming to the fore while he was writing, or, as if he'd absorbed some of the annoyance of those close to Alice, who had to live with her as she was! And one has to admit, Alice wouldn't have been easy to live with.<br /><br />On the plus side, the book is filled with little snippets of information about the royal families of Britain and Greece which I never knew, so it kept me turning the pages.  But that was only because Alice's life, and the Royalties and other people who lived it with her were so interesting;  unfortunately the way Vickers presents it, is not.	2002-04-18

This biography has a wealth of detail and is extremely well written, I recommend it highly.  For anyone with an interest in Queen Victoria; hemophaelia in the British Royal family, and just British Royal history in general, this is a great read.  Lots of new information (to me) and very well presented.  Leopold had a frustrating life due to his illness and his position, but he overcame a great many personal difficulties, matured well, and ultimately had a happy marriage.  The book explores Leopold's close relationship with his sister Alice and her family, which I had not read about in any other biography.  His difficult relationship with Queen Victoria is covered fairly, with sympathy for both parties.  Zeepvat is the rare biographer who can really bring the material alive.	2002-04-16
