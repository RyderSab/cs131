A premise of the Thursday Next series is that the world of literature is real - that the characters are still living their lives when \\"backstage\\", off the page.  It was riotously entertaining to think that all the idiosyncracies of the great characters of literature might be perpetuated when we aren't looking, as when Thursday travels into \\"Wuthering Heights\\" to discover that Heathcliff's dysfunctional family spends their time in group therapy sessions when no one happens to be reading the book. <br /> <br />The premise of \\"Over Easy\\" is based merely on characters from nursery rhymes; otherwise, like Thursday, it belongs solidly to the Fforde-only genre, the literary-fantastical-police-procedural.  Nursery rhymes don't have much of a backstory, and the characters that inhabit them prove to be not detailed or quirky enough to really generate the same giddy fun as Thursday Next.  Humpty Dumpty or Jane Eyre - who would you rather read a 300-page novel about? <br /> <br />The story of detective Jack Spratt and his assistant Mary Mary investigating the death of Humpty Dumpty is, therefore, only marginally more interesting than any other detective yarn.  The nursey rhyme references are fun, but other features of the story are only....odd. For example, the world is run by someone named the Jellyman and public spirituality seems to be organized around a thing called the Sacred Gonga, which is never explained. <br /> <br />I'm still a Fforde fan, but I'll skip that next Nursery mystery and wait for Thursday to re-appear.	2005-09-21

Along the way, we get a lively feel not just for their philosophies, but for the protagonists themselves.    The authors have a light and engaging style, and appear to have done something akin to detective work to try to determined what actually happened in that Oxford room so long ago.  It doesn't sound all that threatening, though: it seems clear that Wittgenstein picked up a poker, left the room in anger, and that participants remember Popper making a famous quip at Wittgeinstein's expense only after W. had left the room.  It does not appear as though the father of falsification was, for example, at risk of losing an eye, or even needing a Band-Aid.    Scarier arguments are had between lesser academics in almost every academic debate I've ever attended.  It's gratifying, in a way, to know that even geniuses get their dander up now and then.  So, if you want to read a quick and entertaining story that humanizes two of the 20th century's greatest philosophers, have a poke at \\"Wittgenstein's Poker.\\"	2005-09-21

I was so, so looking forward to reading \\"Little Women\\" to my daughter, so she could be caught up in it as I was at an early age.  I particularly chose the \\"Whole Story\\" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.    Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).    That's because, apparently, \\"Little Women\\" was initially published in two parts (\\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives\\"), which are generally published as the same book.  Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.      Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!    I feel completely conned.  It's a five-star story - make that maybe even a seven-star story - but it's a one-star edition.	2005-09-16

She has combed original sources for the personal stories and telling details that bring the grand story of the War to life on an intimate scale. She honestly seems to have read every newspaper and government report issued for the entire period.    Two examples will suffice:  women's undergarments were almost impossible to obtain - the materials for corset stays had more worthy uses in the military - so women made undergarments out of blackout cloth, which wasn't rationed.  Similarly, food in restaurants did not require the use of ration coupons, so Britons of the wealthier sort at least got in the habit of eating out for the first time - a habit which surely transformed British eating habits after the war as well.      The sadder, tragic side of the war is not overlooked - Waller starts the book with a chapter on late-war bombings and their effect on the Londoners left behind in the city.    The book is organized topically - a chapter on housing, one on food, one on kids, one on crime, one on politics, etc.  The This topical method means the narrative thread is a bit lost (every chapter seems to start at January and wend its way to December over again).  However, the accumulation of interesting stories is fascinating and a novel addition to the list of anyone interested in London, in the War, or both.    Waller has written a similar book on 17th-century London which does not seem to be available in the U.S. but can be obtained on the UK website for those who enjoy this book as much as I did.	2005-08-29

Pamela Ball is a new writer to me; I picked up her \\"Floating City\\" in anticipation of my upcoming first trip to Hawaii.  The novel is set in Honolulu at the time of the U.S.'s forcible takeover of the islands and of Queen Liliuokalani's imprisonment.  It follows a mysterious Norwegian woman who calls herself Eva Hansen (although we know she has stolen this name from someone), a woman who makes her living as a fortune-teller, a haole living among native Hawaiians.  Hansen discovers the body of a murdered native man washed up on shore, and thus becomes entangled in an intrigue involving the takeover of Hawaiian politics and land by wealthy and corrupt Americans. <br /> <br />Ball does a superb job conveying 19th-century Honolulu, a strange mix of cultures, missionaries, opium, violence, Hawaaian culture in the throes of radical change, taboos, disease.....all in all it has a kind of gritty lurking-evil Wild-West feel, rather like an episode of \\"Deadwood.\\"  The intrigue is secondary to the atmosphere she creates; the result is very stylish and literary rather than genre-driven.  There is an overall theme of identity and confusion: how do we know who we really are?  Eva Hansen isn't really named Eva; the dead man isn't who he seems; Hawaii herself is deeper and more complex than the first glance suggests. <br /> <br />I like discovering writers previously unfamiliar to me, and expect that I will pick up more books by Ball even when my Hawaii trip is long past. PS - Hollywood, this would make a great movie....lots of exotic atmosphere and an interesting plot.  Put in Cate Blanchett as Eva and you've got a winner. <br />	2005-07-21

The Satanic nun Sister Mary Loquacious, in a tried-and-true piece of Gilbert-&-Sullivan-like schtick, mixes up the Anti-christ, born to an American diplomat in England, and a regular British kid, born to a mild family of sweater-vested, pipe-smoking regular Brits.      The four horseman of the Apocalypse (riding motorcycles, so literally Hell's Angels) must ride off to correct matters.  An angel named Aziraphale and a demon named Crowley find they must join forces to find the real Antichrist first.     Who'd'a thought that farce and eschatology would blend so well together?  Although the whole is seamless, Pratchett-ologists and Gaimanites will relish speculating on which parts of the books were penned by which co-author.  Gaiman's vision, as with other of his books such as \\"Neverwhere,\\" seems more genuinely apolyptic and cynical, as when placing the \\"horseman\\" Famine in the New York fashion industry.      Pratchett, it seems to me, is in contrast fundamentally optimistic.  The people he writes about are basically good; it's just that their institutions are silly. So, I claim on behalf of Pratchett the passage where four human bikers decide to follow the Four Horseman: one of them can't make up his mind about what name he should ride under, and vacillates between being called \\"Embarassing Personal Problems,\\" \\"Things Not Working Properly Even After You've Given Them a Really Good Thumping,\\" and \\"No-Alcohol Lager\\" (since Death, War, Famine, and Pollution were already taken). A religious zealot called \\"Thou-Shalt-Not-Commit-Adultery Pulsifer\\" also seems to belong to Pterry.    By all accounts, both authors found this combination of styles hard work.  They don't seem eager to repeat it, regardless of the runaway success of \\"Good Omens\\" itself.  So read this one twice or more for good measure; I don'tthink you'll see its like again.	2005-07-21

Trilipush claims to be an Oxford-educated Egyptologist, the discoverer of a papyrus of ancient erotic poetry by a previously unheard-of pharaoh, Atum-Hadu.  On the basis of this discovery, he publishes the poetry as \\"Desire and Deceit in Ancient Egypt,\\" secures a faculty position at Harvard, and becomes the darling of Boston's society women, who flock to hear him speak the illicit poems.  He even becomes engaged to one in particular, Margaret, whose father funds his future expeditions.    But the book establishes almost immediately, through a series of letters, telegrams, and most particularly Ralph's personal journal, that Ralph is not what he seems to be.  His fate is mixed up somehow with that of an Aussie footsoldier, Paul Caldwell, who disappeared in Egypt during WWI.  Caldwell is being sought by an Australian detective, whose account of the search is related in a lengthy (VERY lengthy) series of letters to Margaret's nephew, decades after the fact.  The detective hints maddeningly that four deaths are involved....whose deaths, though, you won't learn for the most remarkable amount of time.    Letters and journals are not the world's most efficient way to move a mystery's plot along, especially when they are written in a florid Edwardian style. Trilipush himself is a remarkably unappealing character.  Man, Trilipush likes to hear himself talk (or write).  His journal reports many days of deciding which phonograph to take on the dig, and perilously little digging.  Trilipush digs even though he has been forbidden a government license, but assumes the government will welcome him as a hero when he discovers Atum-Hadu's tomb.  Trilipush spys on Howard Carter, discoverer of Tutankhamen's tomb, peeping into his windows whiles he sleeps.      Is he pompous and foolish (but on the level), or is he, well, only pretending to be pompous and foolish?  Heavens, does it really matter?  Reader, do you need to spend your precious time with someone like that?  Even the erotic poetry is only good for a laugh (\\"his leaping cobra,\\" \\"her Nile delta,\\" that sort of thing).	2005-07-21

As is the convention in comic novels of the lives of academics (Jane Smiley's Moo or Kingsley Amis' Lucky Jim, for example), Hank Deveraux, Jr., and his peers in rural Pennsylvania's Railton State University's English department seem stuck in a kind of permanent adolescence - there's a lot of self-involved pouting about who's going to get tenure, or whose contract is going to be renewed.  There are subrosa affairs in which neither half of the couple is in any way emotionally appealing (who'd have either of them, you may find yourself thinking).  Everybody drinks too much.  The whole mess is at least as sad as it is funny.  Having said that, though, it IS genuinely funny...In one hysterically scene, Hank finds himself crawling in the ceiling vents in hopes of overhearing a departmental meeting...that part's a hoot and a half. <br /> <br />Is there really no room in literature for an academic novel not populated by neurotics?  Maybe not.  I don't think anyone could do a better job of depicting this life than Russo has.  It's just that if you're an academic yourself, you may be able to stick your head out your office door for five minutes' overheard conversation and get the same (both sad and funny) effect. <br />	2005-07-20

Up to that point, the story is a Victorian one of the poet Syme, recently employed by Scotland Yard, who is on the verge of infiltrating the secret inner circle of a gang of dynamiting anarchists, each named after a day of the week (hence, Syme himself is \\"The Man Who Was Thursday\\").<br /><br />Eventually, the true identity of all the members of the inner circle is revealed, as Syme chases across England and then, somehow, France, purportedly trying to prevent one of their circle from assassinating the Czar.  It's in this middle section that the books subtitle (\\"A Nightmare\\") seems almost poetically true - the narrative gets overwhelmed by strange details that, like a nightmare, do not follow upon one another.....a team of masked men approach Syme and his compatriots with threatening intent....then suddenly they are at a friend's mansion trying to start a car to escape.....then they can hear the masked men approach on horses....or perhaps its only one horse....or perhaps it's a car.....then the godlike head of the anarchists, Sunday, appears to escape via taxi....then firetruck....then he runs off on an elephant from the London Zoo.....then he escapes in a balloon.  Here you will be scolding yourself for not having paid enough attention, because you won't follow all of it.<br /><br />Then, perhaps, a little bell will go off in your head:  G.K. Chesterton, wasn't he known for his conversion to Catholicism?  Like C.S. Lewis?  Could this perhaps be....allegory?  Is Sunday the anarchist akin to Aslan the Lion?  Well, in a word, yes.<br /><br />It seems to me there are two possible reactions to this stunning resolution, assuming no other reader warned you it was coming:  one, you can be a little ticked off.  You put all this effort into working out the whodunit as though it were a typical spy novel, and it turns out that GOD dun it.  Secondly, you can just stand back at admire Chesterton's skill in getting you to this unlikely point - he knows you might not have picked up the novel if you thought it was religious allegory.<br /><br />My vote goes to the second - it's my first encounter with Chesterton's writings, and I found the book, at least the part up to the point where everything gets nightmarish, by turns thrilling and exceedingly funny.  I am very much looking forward to reading more of his works. But non-religious people might put their guard up, rather as though you had an old aunt who tucks bible verses surreptitiously between the pages of your Agatha Christies or Ian Flemings.hodunit as though it were a typical spy novel, and it turns out that GOD dun it.

In the first volume \\"The Winter Queen,\\" Fandorin was at the heart of the plot set in his own Russia.  He had a life - even a romance - and an interesting background and character.  That volume (which I do recommend) gave a real flavor of 19th-century Russia. The second volume (\\"The Turkish Gambit\\") and this third one, \\"Leviathan,\\" abandon Russia for faraway locations, thus playing to Akunin's weaknesses.   <br /> <br />To begin with, \\"Leviathan\\" resembles nothing so much as a wanna-be Agatha Christie novel; one of a group of strangers isolated together (in this case, first-class passengers on the Titanic-like ship Leviathan) is known to be a murderer:  a Japanese man, a pregnant Swiss woman, a French detective, etc., plus Fandorin himself.  You won't be terribly surprised when you find out who done it. <br /> <br />Not only that, he just can't write about non-Russians and non-Russia in as vigorous a way, and resorts to caricature and plot-borrowing. He also adopts a narrative device that doesn't work particularly well: individual chapters are written from the perspective of the travellers (including presumably from the murderer).  This adds a lot of redundancy to the book as certain events are gone over more than once by different narrators.  Moreover, the narrators are almost embarrasingly trite - the Japanese fellow actually calls himself, in his own (!) journal - a \\"member of the yellow race.\\"   <br /> <br />Fandorin himself is present only to tie up the loose ends of these bits and pieces, and no longer establishes himself as a character worth reading about.  Too bad!  The first volumes were quite enjoyable.  This one is acceptable to fans of the series but if you start with this one you may find yourself somewhat mystified.	2005-06-06

Goldstein is such a clear writer that I finished the book feeling I actually understood this logic.  More than simple clarity, though, she conveys a genuine affection for the subject (both Godel and his proofs).  You can feel why she gets all worked up about its philosophical implications.  It doesn't feel obscure in the least.  How much writing about philosophy can say as much?    If you are looking for a complete description of ALL Godel's life work, you won't be happy (she deals almost exclusively with the incompleteness results, not his other work).  Nor will you find this to be a standard-issue narrative biography (birth, education, marriage, death); although you can extract the basic facts from Goldstein's scant 260 pages, Godel's wife Adela doesn't appear until page 223; Godels' difficulties with his mental health are treated as non-issues rather than as defining or formative events.    In the end, it's all about the math, and I enjoyed it.	2005-06-06

Joey, a good-hearted orphaned heiress, is tossed overboard on a cruise ship by her neer-do-well and hapless husband Chaz, a biologist who has sold his soul to a devilish tomato-grower to falsify the fellow's water-pollution records.  Joey survives to plot revenge with a retired cop, Mick Stranahan, who fishes her out of the water (I see Tom Hanks and Charlize Theron, and William H. Macy as the Minnesotan cop who tries to solve the mystery of Joey's disappearance).    In an Elmore Leonard novel, say, people would get well and truly hurt, dead, tortured, and worse, but in Carl Hiaasen's world little permanent damage comes to the good-hearted. Not just Joey but several people get tossed over the sides of boats but don't all end up in a watery grave.  Tool, a massive bodyguard/enforcer type with a strong resemblance to a bear and an addiction to both Mountain Dew and morphine patches ends up befriending an old lady confined to a nursing home; so even THIS guy drives off into the sunset.  Hiaasen prefers \\"just desserts\\" (a character with a fear of the swamp ends up stuck there permanently) to true bloody revenge.    As is typical of Hiaasen, the best lines go to the side characters; hero Mick Stranahan and heroine Joey Perone are nice enough but not the comic heart of the venture.  But as the paperback has, I hear, just come out, you couldn't do better for a summer beach book than this.	2005-05-29

The plot involves a little 3-foot tall wizard who lives in the arch in New York's Washington Square Park.  Since we used to live a block away and play in the playground there, we thought this would be great!  But Yolen doesn't have much of a feel for New York (the author's note says she lives in Massachusetts and Scotland); she seems to think the park is still full of beatniks and old men playing chess.  <br /> <br />Several details give the sensation that Yolen's heart is just not in this - the kid picks up the marble dog-sized statue and carries it around; a magical table \\"the size of a door\\" goes through a subway turnstile without difficulty or comment. <br /> <br />The plot is mild in the extreme; it involves two kids who make friends with the wizard, who deems himself \\"second class\\" for reasons that are not explained, and who somehow changes the hero's dog into a marble statue.  An evil Snidely-Whiplash-style art dealer villain snaps up the dog statue to tell in his shop; the kids and the wizard try to get it back.  As a measure of the speed at which the plot moves, I'll point out that several pages of this modest 78-page novel are devoted to a petition drive.  I've yet to meet a kid thrilled or entertained by a petition drive! <br /> <br />Readers are advised to stick to Yolen's picture books, which have charm, poetry, and wit. <br /> <br />	2005-05-29

The whole book comes to only 28 pages of text, however, so there is not much to it other than these interactive elements. <br /> <br />Beyond this thrill the book is a serviceable introduction to the mysteries and history of Mount Everest, but it does not cover any new ground.  Its interactive nature would make it an excellent choice for kids, but for adults it is for completists only.  4 stars for kids but 3 for adults.	2005-05-23

This distinct approach has two very pleasant benefits to the reader:  first, the recommendations are written with style and panache distinct to each contributor (the artists recommend arty stuff and describe how things look), and second, the recommendations are the sort you get from people who live and breathe in the city rather than just the rest of us, who just run-in-see-the-sights-turn-around-run-home. <br /> <br />City Secrets: London is even better than other European entrants (say, the Rome book), because virtually everyone writing for the book seems to be a permanent resident, rather than a on-and-off-again visitor. <br /> <br />So, rather than hotels and a greatest-hits list of museums, you get favorite places to walk, nice places to have a cuppa on the way, museums you would discover only on the third walk down the street.  Not all of them are \\"secrets\\" in the sense you wouldn't otherwise have known about them, but all of them are worth knowing. <br /> <br />There is a slight tendency toward redundancy, when multiple contributors mention the same destination.

Let's start by saying that Christopher Moore is the funniest writer out on the North American continent (I might have to cede Europe to Terry Pratchett).  His plots remind me of Carl Hiaassen: typically they fall in the \\"regular guy caught up in a chaotic comedic fiasco not of his own divising\\" genre.  Like Hiaassen, his loopy minor characters are half the fun - there's never a dull moment in a Moore book.    In \\"Coyote Blue,\\" for example, an insurance agent with a shadowy past (he is a Crow Indian who grew up on the rez and left there as a fugitive) comes face-to-face with his past in the form of Coyote, the randy trickster character of Native legends, who shows up in the novel (variously)as a sometimes-visible Native dude, a sometimes wolf, and anything else he might become to cause the hero Samson Hunts Alone as much trouble as possible.  In a matter of minutes, Samson loses his job when Coyote loves up a potential client, his condo when Coyote (in his wolf form) nibbles on a neighbor's pet, etc.      Also typical of Moore, Sam eventually comes to realize the error of his ways and abandons his pretenses, returning to his more modest roots.  In the meantime, the chapters roll on like a series of riots.  Throw in lots of comic and amusingly raunchy sexual encounters and you have classic Moore.    I don't think this is his best work - I'd save that praise for \\"Lamb,\\" the funniest novel in human history.  But if you develop a taste for Moore, you're going to want to read this one too.	2005-05-02

The twins' parents are free-thinkers that chafe under the burden of constant testing, and Kestrel gets them in deep trouble by causing a scene in class one day.  While attempting to escape from a terrible fate, she discovers the Emperor, who sends her on a mission to return a silver pendant to a mystical statue that stands in the center of town, the \\"Wind Singer.\\"  If she can return this silver piece, the \\"voice\\" of the windsinger, the people will be released from the tyrannical society and be happy again.<br /><br />Thus follows a Hobbit-like adventure through desserts occupied by entire cities of battling wind-ships on wheels, through forest full of magical wolves and creepy \\"old children\\" whose touch infects you with a loopy zombie-like old age, and most especially toward the Zars, a race of beautiful automatons whose only aim in life is to kill.<br /><br />Bowman and Kestril, their little sister Pinpin, and their marvelous parents, are wonderful creations.  You will have no problem getting interested in their story and you'll be on their side the whole way.<br /><br />I have to admit though that it's not clear to me what alternative to meritocracy Nicholson would endorse though....is it the Mud People, who live underground on potato-like \\"mud nuts,\\" their carefree life so utterly colorless that the male Mud People feel obliged to enhance it with the narcotic hallucinogenic \\"tixa leaves.?\\" Nicholson's somewhat cavalier attitude toward drugs (even the heroes eventually partake)left me a bit put off.<br /><br />Are the singing happy and utterly unambitous mud people the only alternative to a life of constant examinations?

The book is, however, the opposite of mean-spirited: it is a sympathetic, almost hymn-like story of rural Indiana at the turn of the 20th century. The plot is simple: after the switch-happy Miss Myrt shuffles off this mortal coil, Tansy (the narrator Russell's older sister) becomes teacher to a rag-tag bunch of kids.  Oh the horror! My own 11-year-old's eyes grew wide at the idea of being under the thumb of a sibling all day long. To buoy up the narrative there are a lot of what you might call \\"hijinks\\" - setting the school privy on fire, a buggy accident in which an old maid aunt ends up with her skirts around her head, that sort of thing. <br /> <br />I thought at first this might all be too mild for my adventure and action-seeking son.  But we read it out loud to each other, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Richard Peck goes for a kind of Mark Twain vibe - folksy, humorous, and above all affectionate.  He really likes his characters, even when he is making light of them. Peck's genius as a writer comes not from a screenplay-like imagination (he's not all plot twists and peril) but from his ability to convey strong and interesting characters.  Everyone - even old Aunt Maud - turns out to have hidden depths, even though the book is really very very funny (!).   <br /> <br />Sorta makes me wish Peck would try his hand at something for the over-30 crowd.  He's a wonderful writer and the book is a great addition to the recent literature for older kids. <br />	2005-05-01

I am just certain that none of the roads on the map of Western Ireland, for example, at all resemble the ittybitty single-lane road I took to get to the ferry across the Shannon Estuary.  Likewise I don't see any of the more interesting small roads we used to putter around Argyll in western Scotland.  Nor that funky little pathlet we used to drive to Monterosso on the coast of Tuscany. <br /> <br />I was also expecting small maps of major cities to appear in the corners of country-maps, in the way they do for state-maps in the U.S.  Too bad for you if you want to get through Paris in a car - now you don't even have a map to do it with. <br /> <br />If you want to stay on main highways, and if you plan on staying away from cities, you probably won't get lost, but truly you are better off buying more detailed maps of individual countries or regions than this.	2005-04-27

If it were not for the occasional appearance of Mulch Diggums, the dwarf with f*rts so explosive they can propel him safely from an underwater submarine all the way up to the surface of the ocean, the adult reader would find this the equal of any thriller written for adult eyes.<br /><br />In the present volume, the evil child genius Artemis Fowl has forgotten all about his friends the fairies, and is occupied stealing a famous painting from a bank vault in true Mission-Impossible style.  His triumph is interrupted by his archenemy pixie Opal Koboi, who has a plot (perhaps this won't surprise you) to destroy the world.  Without giving away any of the rapid-fire plot developments, let's just say that Artemis, accompanied by Holly Short the intrepid LEPrechaun, Foaly the tech-wizard centaur, Artemis' bodyguard Butler, and the strangely compelling Mulch, fouls her plans (ok, sorry).<br /><br />The intriguing list of gadgets and devices author Eoin Colfer employs to move the plot forward includes: cloning, creatures who shed their entire skin and use it later as a disguise in a prison break, retinal imaging, 100 million tons of molten iron, heat-seeking missiles, spacesuits with helmets that carry biometric information back to the center of the earth, handguns that bond with their owners, etc.<br /><br />The ending promises a change for Holly, but a future with lots of Mulch and Artemis in it - and possibly some romance in later volumes.<br /><br />The excitement, pace, and humor would be precisely like the best PG-13 thriller you will see at the movie theatre this summer, were it not for the fact that many of the characters are fairies, pixies, trolls, and dwarfs.  And just like those movies, a few parents will wish there were less, well, military hardware in this series.  A few of the more humorless moms will wish there were fewer f*rts.  If those things don't bother you, you should not let the kids keep it to themselves; it's a great fun read for all ages.	2005-04-23

When I first picked it up I thought it would be an interesting historical novel about family life on Alcatraz Island in the 1930s (the families of prison guards lived on the island).  Then, when I met the books' protagonist, Moose Flanagan, and his older sister Natalie, I was briefly concerned that it would be a disease-of-the-month kind of novel, because Natalie is autistic.    But Choldenko manages to transcend all genres with her wonderful characters.  Moose is not just \\"some kid,\\" he is observant, funny, wise, and adventuresome (he's also a great first baseman). Piper, the warden's daughter, is not just the snooty chid of privilege, she's also got this never-say-die entrepreneurial spirit (It is Piper's scheme to sell the Alcatraz laundry service to mainland schoolmates which gives the novel its title).  Most importantly, Natalie is NOT a disease-of-the-month kind of kid, but grows and changes over the course of the book.    This story is even \\"bigger\\" than it sounds - more interesting, and deeper.  If we must assign the novel to a genre, it should be a family or coming-of-age novel.  Moose struggles with the isolation imposed on him by the island, his parents struggle with the isolation imposed by the autism of their daughter, and Natalie's autism imposes its own loneliness.  Over time, though, they come to understand each other.  It's really satisfying to see a story about a family in which all the members deeply love one another despite their flaws.    I admit that the ending was a little pat for my tastes - just when it seems that Natalie will never be admitted to the special school she needs, the famous prisoner Al Capone intervenes.  Other than the \\"Gangster ex machina\\" ending, though, it's a sure winner.	2005-04-20

Varya pursues a hapless fiance to the front of a Russian-Turkish war, and encounters Fandorin as he must uncover a saboteur in the Russian ranks.  As in Winter Queen, Akunin stylishly conveys the culture of 19th-century Russia and has a tight rein on his plot, although the Russiain patronymics take some concentration on the part of the reader.    Fandorin's emotional detachment is the believable result of what he went through in the first novel, \\"The Winter Queen,\\" and is all the more intriguing for being distant.  As a result of this device a lot of Fandorin's brilliance happens off-screen, so to speak, reported only after the fact.  Because of this, Fandorin seems well on his way to being more like Sherlock Holmes - brilliant but emotionally unconnected to everything around him.  Readers will have to wait and see, it seems, whether Fandorin is doomed forever to a lonely life.    Definitely wait to read \\"Turkish Gambit\\" until you've read \\"Winter Queen\\" first, or Fandorin's detachment will make him seem unsympathetic rather than sad.	2005-04-04

From her early teens, Cox has eliminated almost everything else from her life to dedicate herself to open-water swims in treacherous and freezing waters, including crossing the Bering Straight between Alaska and the Soviet Union, and swimming a mile in the Antarctic Ocean.   <br /> <br />What I really loved about this book is the way Cox struggled not only with the physical challenges of the swims but also struggled to make the swims mean something more to the world at large.  For example, the Bering Straight swim took something lik 16 years of meetings and negotiations to arrange, hundreds of donors and volunteers.  But in the end that swim stood as a testament and metaphor for the improving connections between nations.  Everywhere she goes, Cox seems to have inspired anyone fortunate enough to witness her.  That this has come with a great deal of personal sacrifice--money troubles, social limitations, significant nerve damage--is humbly underplayed in the book.  She has a kind of determination and self-confidence that transcends a particular athletic endeavour. <br /> <br />That Cox does not *look* like anyone's idea of an endurance athlete just adds to the inspiration -- she's 45 and she's swimming to Antarctica...so what's MY excuse? <br />	2005-04-04

As usual though, Moore's devotion to lunacy and his sharply-written minor characters more than compensate for a few loose ends in the plot.	2005-04-04

Historical archaelogy is the archaeological study of eras that might also have written documentation - so what can digging around in old privies tell us that the paper trail does not?    Cantwell and Wall prove the answer is \\"an almost infinite amount.\\"  From a painstaking analysis of shards of pottery found in various privies, for example, we learn how the world changes for women when New York became too big to walk (they no longer lived above the shop, so to speak).  In landfill in lower Manhattan, the charred ghost of a ship that sunk in the harbor in the 17th-century tells us something about trade back then. Most touchingly, the discovery and excavation of the old African Burial Grounds tells us something about the lives of the enslaved (did you know that over 20% of the residents of colonial Manhattan were enslaved?  I didn't; I learned it from this book).    The book is extremely well-designed, liberally illustrated with photos of digs, but also old maps and engravings.  If you have lived or walked New York, it will inspire you to look at the city in a new way - the ground you tred on still bears the marks of centuries past.    By the way, the authors have also brought out a book of walking tours based on their discoveries - next time I'm in town I'm tucking it under my arm and having a good look around at the vestiges of the 17th-19th centuries presented here.	2005-03-28

They almost succeeded in matching not only Scott's route but Scott's tragedy - they barely made it to the Pole and had to be airlifted out.    Hillary and co-writer John Elder's non-traditional approach to the story is much more interesting than a straightforward narrative of an incomplete mission.  The book is told in two distinct voices:  Elder provides the basic narrative, while Hillary (set apart in boldface from the main story) tells the story of what was going on in his head as he pulled pulled pulled toward the Pole.      Sick and isolated, Hillary is surrounded by the ghostly memory of his family (Sir Edmund Hillary, the first to climb Everest; Peter's mother and sister lost in a Nepalese plane crash)and many friends from the climbing world, the majority of whom died while mountaineering.      These ghosts, or at least the memory of them, are as real to the reader as they seemed to the hallucinating Hillary.  The two-voices 'device,' which might have seemed artificial, adds to the powerful emotional impact of Hillary's memories.  It is a ghostly book, indeed.  One of my favorite reads so far this year!	2005-03-28

Voltaire's classic novel Candide wedded Voltaire's love of natural philosophy to a cynical worldview and a manic, episodic plot full of damsels in distress, naive heros, the machinations of the powerful, etc.  Voltaire took about 80 pages to do this, but Neal Stephenson takes over 900 to do the same thing.      The first 300+ pages are the story of the scientist Daniel Waterhouse, a college roommate, or so it seems, of Isaac Newton (historical characters constitute the lion's share of the population of the novel).  The second section switches setting and tone entirely, involving the accidental rescue of a harem girl named Eliza by one Jack Shaftoe during the siege of Vienna.  Only in the 3rd section does all this come together, in a kind of fractionary way, as Eliza improbably becomes a countess, a spy, and the chief financial advisor to most of Europe.    Stephenson is madly entertaining on a page-by-page basis, but all this running around does make it hard to keep track of the novel as a whole.  Stephenson also has a rather whimsical tendency to throw in bits of words and character out of sync with his 17th-century setting (the word \\"sh**tlist\\" appears at least twice, I believe).    Thus, if you limit yourself to Voltaire-sized doses, and don't take the whole thing too seriously, you will enjoy this book immensely, half rip-roaring yarn, half epistolary novel (huge sections consisting of nothing but letters to and from the characters), half somber history-of-science (Actually, three halves is probably not enough for this particular book).  But don't try to read it one go.    I really did enjoy it, but I'm STUFFED. I expect I will eventually take a stab at the 2nd and 3rd volumes of Stephenson's Baroque Cycle (Quicksilver being only the first third), but just now I feel rather as though I had eaten the whole Easter-basket full of chocolate.  Next year will be soon enough for more.	2005-03-28

I love looking over maps and always have, so I absolutely understand Miles Harvey's motivation for writing this book.  \\"Island of Lost Maps\\" was generated by an article that Harvey wrote for \\"Outside\\" magazine, about the crime-spree theft of countless valuable old maps by one Gilbert Bland.  Harvey tracks Bland and his insidious razor-blade across the country as Bland moved from library to library slicing maps out of old atlases at rare-books libraries, then follows Bland through the justice system. <br /> <br />Bland's story, however, is just not strong enough to bear the weight of a full-length book.  When Harvey interweaves the Bland story with the history of exploration, of mapping, and the story of Harvey's own obsession with maps, he has my full attention, and he writes with interest and passion.  (For this, I wish I could give the book 3 and a half stars instead of only three.) <br /> <br />But honestly the Bland story holds him back.  Bland is not himself a fascinating or exceptional character, his life just isn't that interesting, and in fact Harvey never even gets a chance to meet him, so the drama that can be wrung from this turnip is limited.  At one point Harvey is so desparate for drama that he compares the mild-mannered and virtually invisible Bland to the impetuous 19th-century adventurer John Charles Fremont, who first rafted down the Colorado river without even scouting it first. <br /> <br />Although I basically liked this book, I just can't see a parallel between a guy who runs rapids and a guy who razorblades maps out of atlases!	2005-03-10

(If you want a taste of author Dodie Smith's ability to write funny characters, bear in mind she is also the author of \\"101 Dalmations\\"). <br /> <br />Two wealthy American brothers move in next door; although they are initially blinded by sister Rose's classic beauty, eventually one of them (I won't say which) sees the depth of character behind the narrator, the more sincere and thoughtful Cassandra. <br /> <br />Cassandra is an enchanting narrator (the book is a series of first-person entries into her journal) - she is witty, self-effacing, and completely authentic. The reader will absolutely believe she is a real, irreplacable person. <br /> <br />I was so enamored of Cassandra that at first I worried for her when she fell in love - I was worried about a too-convenient fairy-tale ending. But happily the \\"happily ever after\\" is replaced by a more intriguing end; Cassandra's final decision is perfectly consistent with her chracter. <br /> <br />I only wish I had read this when I was, like her, a teenager - it would have meant a lot to me to meet a character so ambitious, energetic, lively, funny, who still clearly has romance in her future.	2005-03-02

Fandorin is a 20-year-old orphan recently joined a detective corps in 1870s Russia.  His first simple case - a suicide - turns complex and baffling.  Fandorin is shy and tentative at first (he blushes constantly), but proves clever and even fearless as he chases villains across Europe, unmasks an international conspiracy, and risks death many times.    As others have noted, Fandorin's adventures more closely resemble Sherlock Holmes or James Bond than the more cerebral Hercule Poirot. While there are Holmesian brilliant deducation and matchless archvillains, there are also James-Bond-like dangerous romance, conspiracy, and physical danger.    I was truly shocked by the ending. It took me a while to accept it, actually.  But in retrospect the end of \\"Winter Queen\\" sets up Fandorin - and Akunin's coming series of books about him - to be a much deeper, troubled, and thus more interesting character.	2005-02-28

Jared Diamond tells it like a detective story, using remarkable forensic evidence to learn, for example, how the diet of the residents of Easter Island declined over time (by counting the various kinds of animal bones they left in their garbage).  There's all sort of neat stuff here - I learned what \\"dendrochronology\\" is, for example (the science of telling the age of a building from counting the rings of the trees it was constructed from).  Diamond observes that the interconnections and specialization of civilizations can cause them to fail - Island B cuts down all its trees, so it can't make oceangoing canoes anymore, so it can't trade sharp stones with Island A, so Island A is no longer capable of making effective tools. <br /> <br />The second part is interesting but not as convincing:  Diamond tries to discover what distinguishes successful civilizations from those that failed in Part I.  In this part, the stories are interesting but the reasoning seems random:  Diamond argues that the European colony in Greenland collapsed because it was hierarchical and tightly controlled by its leaders (so it could not adapt to changing circumstances); but he also argues that Tokugawa Japan succeeded because the central shogunate kept tight control over ever tree in the country (i.e., it was hierarchical and tightly controlled). <br /> <br />In the third part, Diamond tries to work out why societies make bad decisions that cause them to fail by mismanaging their ecology.  This part is the least effective of the book.  Although he takes a stab at describing the dynamics of group decision-making, this is not Diamond's strength.  In the end, his prediction is optimistic (about Australia) or pessimistic (about China) based on his own instincts.  Diamond's instincts are better than mine, surely, but less compelling than the scientific evidence he puts behind his argument in the first third of the book. <br />	2005-02-16

For example, he reviews Claude Steele's research on self-stereotyping to explain how individuals sensitive about gender, race, or even height may have difficulty behaving in a way inconsistent with those stereotypes.  Or, he describes how how psychologist John Gottman has been able to predict with 95% accuracy whether a couple will remain married for another 15 years based only on their facial expressions observed over the course of an hour's argument.    Here's a great example of what I mean by synthesis:  he describes research on how decisions made in a very short time (split seconds) cause people to rely on hard-wired or stereotyped associations (say, between the race of a victim such as Amadou Diallou and the likelihood of the thing in his pocket being a gun).  The effect is exacerbated when people make decisions in groups.  Then, he carefully breaks down the events of the Diallou shooting - multiple decisions about Diallou's intent, threat, etc, followed by his shooting in a hail of 41 bullets-all of which took only 7 seconds total.  He makes a compelling case that Diallou's death was in part due to the close quarters in which the decision was taken (leaving only a few yards and a second or two between cop and victim), as well as to the number of cops having to make the call.  He even provides a tentative solution - police officers who patrol alone are less likely to get into this sort of trouble, because they are more cautious and give themselves more time to \\"override\\" these mistaken and stereotyped associations.    For the \\"layperson,\\" Gladwell makes lively and relevant experiments that would, if we read them ourselves, might appear obscure and clinical. For the psychologist (among whom I include myself), it's a bit of a thrill to see that hours of toil in a lab can have some real impact on how important real-world decisions are made.    I do have one very small beef with the book (it could hardly be smaller): I think the subtitle (\\"The Power of Thinking without Thinking\\") is misleading and undersells the book.  It makes it sound like lightweight self-help that is universally positive about the power of instantaneous thought.  In fact, the book is quite balanced on the subject of when and whether \\"thin-sliced\\" thought results in better or worse decisions.    More than anything, though, I admire Gladwell's taste:  he has a knack of identifying great illustrations, the great psychology that supports them, and making a crystal-clear connection between the two.  Again and again I found myself thinking \\"you know, a good experiment for him to illustrate this concept would be so-and-so's,\\" only to find that specific example on the next page.    I know of no journalist who commands the respect of social scientists to the extent Malcolm Gladwell does, and I expect this will be the average reader of \\"Blink\\" will feel the same respect for this fascinating book.	2005-02-10

Farrell or The Siege of Krishnapur until one day I was scanning a list of winner of England's Booker Prize and I noticed that Siege was out-of-print in America. I was so intrigued I sent off to England for it, but it is now also available in the U.S.    The novel narrates the story of the British community at Krishnapur during the Indian Mutiny of 1857, when the entire community holed up in the Residency (like a governor's palace) for months under siege. Farrell's style is highly cinematic, reminiscent of great movie epics about that era, such as \\"The Man Who Would Be King,\\" - lots of scope, majesty, explosions, and bright-red uniforms, added to the day-to-day domestic squabbles of the community. Farrell's take is not a shallow war novel though; he is witty, ironic, inspired, and sad in turn.     The book features remarkable turns of fortune and engaging details on every page, all of which were dramatically motivated and apt. (Examples: When the besieged run out of ammunition, they create canister shot by stuffing ladies' stockings with silverware. There's a sudden infestation of flying bugs that will make you jump right out of your chair. Two doctors have an argument about the cause of cholera with dramatic consequences. A lucky shot by a Lieutenant....well I won't spoil it for you.)    The main character, the Collector, seems to stand in for all of Britain as he is transformed by his Indian experience: first arrogance and a passion for bringing British `civilization' to the uncivilized, then bravado as he stands up to the initial assaults, then despair as he watches the failure of mere ingenuity to overcome the natives. In a wonderful little coda at the end of the book you can see how he has been utterly transformed by the experience.    A wonderful find, a 'must read'! I'm off to read the rest of Farrell's novels!	2005-01-29

Within pages, he is convicted to hang, handed a lockpick by a beguiling female bystander, and escapes, naked and freezing, from England's toughest prison.    Ingeniously, Weaver contrives to \\"hide in plain sight\\" disguised as a wealthy landowner from the Caribbean, while he works out who framed him.      Then things, sadly, bog down a bit, as the answer to his inquiry has to do with 18th-century British political rivalries, which takes many dozens and dozens of pages to explain.  Do you find modern party politics fascinating?  No?  Then probably you will not like the 18th-century version much better.    This slows down the narrative to a snail's pace in parts, and may not interest the more thrill-seeking of Mr. Liss' readership.  (I actually rather liked it but then I am a history buff.)  In general, though, although Mr. Liss never fully recaptures the vigor of the first few scenes, he delivers interesting characters and an out-of-the-ordinary plot with an authentic colonial-era atmosphere and details.	2005-01-17

Live, the audience responds quickest to the funny bits but might easily leave the auditorium a little unsettled at the underlying bitterness of his previous escapades as, say, a Santaland elf at Macy's. <br /> <br />In \\"Dress Your Family\\" the recipe is reversed - it seems more sad than funny - but as a result you can more easily hear what a fine writer Sedaris really is.  The stories here are nothing short of tragic in several cases - the one moment of family happiness while shopping for a 2nd home (before the family falls apart behind his mother's alcoholic stupors), the unspoken but apparent mental illness of his sister, the terrible life of the little girl in the apartment next door who takes a liking to her neighbor David.   <br /> <br />This allows us to see that Sedaris-the-writer is even more expert at description and character than he is at making us laugh.  Personally, I value this ability  more, but if you are looking for your life to be made lighter by something light and humorous, this is not the book for you. <br /> <br />The most touching stories are those involving his brother, Paul, who seems to be the token regular guy in the Sedaris family (like that blond chick on the Addams family). David Sedaris uses the occasion of Paul's wedding and the subsequent birth of Paul's daughter to demonstrate both his own fierce love of his family and his total alienation from this ordinary, straight world.  <br /> <br />On audio this comes through even stronger (Sedaris' imitation of his brother's Carolina accent and irony-free straight-guy behavior enhances it), but it's still at its core a message both totally peculiar to Sedaris and totally universal - the way we love our families and can yet feel totally, even existentially apart from them.   <br /> <br />It's much deeper than you probably knew, or perhaps even wanted, from Sedaris, but it's worth a try.	2005-01-17

The style and subject matter are far too mature for younger Potter fans: the human hero, Henry Atherton, is alienated from his family by the fact that his mother is having an affair....with his father's female secretary.  The fairy hero Pyrrgus is captured by a sadistic glue-factory owner who kills and conducts medical experiments for sport.  Towards the end of the book, someone's face gets entirely blown off, the results described in bloody detail.    Now, for mature audiences, hey it's up to you whether that sort of thing is worth reading.  But even if you like the subject matter, stylistically author Herbie Brennan pales beside his competitors Rowling (Potter books) or Stroud (Bartimaeus books).  First, a lot of his plotting is highly derivative (the scenes in which demons are summoned are VERY close in style to Bartimaeus; his heroine is Holly, which may remind you of the Artemis Fowl books).  Second, the villains are WAY over the top (the secret ingredient in the glue made by the villains? Baby kittens!).  Finally, the various plot lines take practically forever to come together - Henry and Pyrgus don't show up in the same chapter until page 92 of the book.    So, 3 stars for mature teens ONLY and 1 star for anyone younger - definitely not for most of the Potter crowd!	2005-01-17

Henry with zombies	Do you remember that heartwarming turn-of-the-century Christmas story by O. Henry--a poor couple has no assets except the wife's beautiful hair and the husband's pocketwatch.  Too broke to buy gifts, the wife cuts her hair to buy a watch chain, while ironically the (unknowing) husband sells his watch to buy a set of hair combs.    Christopher Moore's \\"The Stupidest Angel\\" is a hallucinatory version of that holiday tale.  Molly, the former star of a warrior-princess TV series, has given up taking her anti-psychotic meds in order to buy her darling Theo the world's finest....bong. Lack of meds causes her to take her inner Warrior a little too seriously.  Theo, having promised to give up the Weed, surreptitiously grows a patch of it to finance the purchase of a Warrior sword for his Molly.      It's touching, isn't it?  Like O. Henry if he'd gotten a hold of some weird mushrooms.    Meanwhile, swarming around this subplot, an addled angel, in an attempt to grant a child's wish to resurrect Santa, unintentionally brings the town's entire graveyard back to life. Theo, our friendly pothead, also happens to be the town's sheriff, so must defend everyone against the possibility of having their brains sucked out by a former (MUCH former) neighbor.    If you are a Moore aficionado, this combination of sentiment and comic psychosis will be happily familiar (many of the characters have appeared in previous Moore books).  If you are new to Moore, you can step right into the fun even if you haven't read the earlier books.  In his own sick and twisted way, Moore has written a Christmas tale in classic form, with a zombie twist.	2005-01-10

McCarthy's mother was Irish (although he himself was raised in England), and this fact has generated in him an Irish lilt to his prose, if not to his actual voice.    McCarthy's tone exactly captures an Irish skill for simultaneous disdain and affection for everyone he runs across.  All tourists, including himself, are faintly (or more than faintly) ridiculous.  McCarthy gets chased by cows while out looking for prehistoric Irish monoliths.  He gets admonished by priests with spitshined brogans while on a barefoot 3-day fasting pilgrimage.  He drinks a lot (a LOT), and for some odd reason, he seems to stop at every Chinese restaurant in Ireland.     If you can overlook McCarthy's paradoxically happy good-humored dislike of almost everything (and you should), you'll find the book funny, appealing, even charming.  McCarthy would be a very entertaining fellow to run into at the pub.  A perfect read in anticipation or in memory of your own vacation to Ireland.	2004-12-13

This is as nice an edition of Dylan Thomas' \\"A Child's Christmas in Wales\\" as it is possible to imagine.  It is beautifully laid out, in a wide children's picture-book format, with colorful and evocative paintings by illustrator Christopher Raschka.    If you've never encountered Dylan Thomas'  vision of his childhood Christmas in Wales before, you're in for a real treat.  Boys chase each other through the snow; uncles repair to the drawing room lighting pipes; aunts offer Useless Presents such as mufflers long enough to swing from, and my favorite - the Prothero family's house starts to go on fire, which the gaggle of boys attempts to extinguish with snowballs.    It's clear that a poet wrote this; every word counts not just in the mental images it provokes but also in its glorious SOUND - please try reading it out loud; it is positively musical.     But - I confess the current edition seems mismarketed to me.  It's not really a children's book, although older children, at least, may enjoy having it read to them.  The picture-book format (and the above product info's insistence that the reading level is \\"4 to 8 years\\") might make you, the reader, think of it as a good Christmas present for the pre-school set.  But the language is dense and unfamiliar to little ones (the uncles smokes 'briars' not pipes), and the text is longer than a little kid will sit still for (my 5-year-old for example).      I read it to my very attentive 10-year-old as well, and even he had trouble grasping all Thomas' delicious and metaphorical language.      So buy it; read it out loud to yourself in front of an evening fireplace, and Merry Christmas to you all.	2004-12-07

Here, Fforde again shows his comedic knack for throwing together anomalous characters from history and fiction and letting them play off each other. Thursday's Mom has become landlady to Otto von Bismarck (19th-century Chancellor of Germany), Lady Emma Hamilton (the often-inebriated paramour of Lord Nelson), and Hamlet himself.  Several flirtations ensue, with riotous consequences.    The main plot again involves Thursday trying to avoid a certain Armageddon by outwitting her corporate foes.  While trying to prevent the end of the universe, Thursday tracks the Minotaur through trashy wild-west fiction, having scented him with Slapstick; the sporadic appearance of banana peels and falling pianos in the plot prove it.     There's also a delicious undercurrent of modern cultural references; for example, Thursday's hunt for a secret producer of Will Shakespeare clones eventually leads her to a distant walled-in enclosure straight out of \\"Jurassic Park,\\" only populated by rampaging herds of Napoleon clones. Thursday must also temporarily become a champion player of \\"Superhoop,\\" a kind of violent croquet-like sport with rules that are surely meant to parody Harry Potter's quidditch scenes.    In the previous two volumes of the series, a lot of things were on frustrating hold:  Thursday's husband Landon had been \\"eradicated\\" (someone went back in time and worked it so he'd never been born) and, although she was pregnant, almost two volumes of the series had passed without the appearance of her child.  In this volume, Fforde ties up these loose ends in brilliant style. All is resolved happily (I find Fforde is quite good at writing the romantic passages as well), but so neatly that I fear we won't hear from Thursday again.      Perhaps we can convince Fforde to go back in time to give Thursday a 2nd (or is it a fifth?) chance.	2004-10-18

It's both funnier and smarter than that premise.  It actually does spell out, chapter by chapter, the workings of the branches of government, the election process, and the role of journalism in creating and destroying all these (complete with in-class exercises and homework!)     If you're a fan of the show, you will enjoy listening to Stewart riff on journalism's loss of integrity, to Samantha Bee's apologetic asides about \\"do you mind if I tell you how we do it in Canada?\\", Ed Helms' presentation of his qualifications to be Supreme Court justice, etc.  The book is, however, not just a rehash of pieces from the TV show; the book form allows the writers to make their favorite comedic jabs against our system's foibles with more historical and literary support.  (Who knew, for example, the role that the rivalry between newspaper magnates William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer played in instigating the Spanish-American war?)      Coming from any source but the Daily Show, this premise might have been tedious, but from this team it is consistently and hysterically funny.  Free of the time and vocabulary limits of TV, they really cut loose.  The seven-dirty-words-you-can't-say-on-television here are put to good use, amended by such popular modifiers as bat, horse, bull, and mother. So don't bring it home to the kiddos, or listen to the audiobook on your mini-van stereo, and avoid it altogether if you don't yourself throw a good hearty @*$%&% around every now and then.  But remember the best, funniest lines about the preservation of democracy and repeat these lessons to your kids.  It's funny and important stuff.	2004-10-14

It is England in the early 1800s as she has always been: the Empire that dominates the globe, full of scoundrels, snobs, and...well, magic.  Susanna Clarke tweaks history by adding a magical past to England at its zenith:  centuries back, magic and magical ability were commonplace; scholars of magic could move cities, create roads to nowhere, summon faerie servants to do their bidding, and leave the human world to reign over kingdoms on the other side of Hell.  In Strange and Norrell's England, however, the rise of the Empire has also witnessed the devolution of practical Magic.  It seems that only one man - the reclusive, wealthy, and vain Mr. Norrell - retains the ability to do real magic, an ability that he demonstrates by making all the statues in Yorkminster Cathedral come alive momentarily. <br /> <br />Norrell resents the idea of other magicians; he buys up every magical book in every library in England, and makes himself valuable to the English government by conjuring up invading fleets of British ships made solely out of rain, to threaten the French fleet.  His drive to become the sole magician in England leads him to take a terrible risk, unleashing a wicked fairy, known only as \\"the man with the thistledown hair\\" on London.  Then, a new magician appears on the scene:  the heroic, even romantic Jonathan Strange.  Where Norrell is a sullen recluse, Strange is an affable fellow devoted to his wife.  Where Norrell uses his magic for personal gain, Strange wants magic to save England.  He even accompanies the Duke of Wellington on campaigns against Napoleon, saving Brussels from French invasion by temporarily depositing it in (it appears) the plains of Nebraska. Eventually the rivalry between Norrell and Strange puts Strange's wife at terrible risk; Strange goes near mad in his attempts to save her.  At the end, he succeeds, but Strange and Norrell's fates are permanently linked together in a way promising for those wanting a sequel. <br /> <br />This book hasbeen mismarketed as an adult Harry Potter.  It is more closely related to Jane Austen or perhaps Charles Dickens.  First, because its author Clarke is, stylistically, an exquisite mimic of the tone of its times:  Clarke's narrator has some of Austen's wit and powers of observation about Society, as well as some of Dickens' ability to put her full creative genius into the smallest scenes and characters (everybody in this book is terrifically interesting).  Some reviewers (most notably the Times' Janet Maslin) objected to the book's length (it runs about 800 pages), but to my mind its length is completely consistent with its era and the charms of its story (it even has some footnotes, which are interesting in their own right).  Who, after all, would have wished David Copperfield or Sense and Sensibility to \\"get to the point\\"?  I would have been disappointed to have it end a moment sooner.  It is not meant to be the book version of an `action' picture, as the Harry Potter series, for all its charms, seems in comparison.   <br /> <br />Clarke adds to these strengths of style and character a plot that, for all its length, is quite gripping.  I predict it will matter a great deal to you how and why Arabella Strange escapes her peril.   People who prefer pure fantasy to historic fiction may not love this book as much as I did.  But, if you like books that give a deliciously authentic sense of an era, and books that are full of interesting twists and turns, you will find a unique combination of them here. <br />	2004-09-27

This book is part of the wonderful new series of republished children's books from the New York Review of Books.  Over 80 years old, \\"The Magic Pudding\\" describes the adventures of a koala bear, named Bunyip Bluegum - the kind of koala who wears a high collar and spats - who falls in with a crazy cowboy sort of fellow named Bill Barnacle and a penguin named Sam Sawnoff.    Bill and Sam are possessed of a magic pudding (named Albert, if you can believe this), who regenerates every time you take a bite of him and changes into whatever flavor you like.  Albert the pudding is much coveted by two evil villains who are constantly tricking our Heroes into giving up the Pudding, whereupon they must go and re-re-re-rescue it.    The characters and style are very reminiscent of \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" with Bunyip seeming a little White-rabbitish to me, and Bill and Sam sort of Mad Hatter and Dormouse-y.  The effect is somewhere in between \\"Alice\\" and an old Loony Tunes in which Bugs Bunny constantly bewilders Elmer Fudd.     The whole narrative is punctuated with many whimsical song lyrics, like the poetry in Carroll's book. The lyrics make it a great read-aloud for the younger set, although older kids might be a bit puzzled by its style.  However, everyone will be charmed by the Pudding himself and want one of their very own.	2004-09-27

Doig's literary style, though, is a bit Hemingway-esque to me (I like 'real' Hemingway but not Hemingway-esque).  His characters speak in stoic monosyllabic bursts, although the narrative voice seems in contrast torrid and mannered.  These stoic characters sporadically explode with highly emotional self-revelation: a guy who barely puts two words together for the whole trip suddenly burst into tears revealing his sad reason for a gambling addiction.  I wish Doig had let us \\"in on\\" his characters a little earlier in the game, but perhaps that would be inconsistent with the style of the story. <br /> <br />For my money, Doig has a superb handle on nature and adventure and a less good handle on character, but fans of adventure in general, and the Pacific coast in particular, will still enjoy reading this.	2004-09-04

Books are in her genetic make-up, obtained from her energetic parents, shared with her affectionate husband, and passed on to her young children.      The book itself consists of a series of short essays on book and reading-related topics: happy arguments between new spouses about how to merge their collections; the peccadillos of how each of us treats books (to bend down a corner or not to bend?), the joys of spelunking in used bookstores; and the like.    Fadiman's prose is charming and articulate, as those readers  familiar with her outstanding book \\"The Spirits Catches You and You Fall Down\\" will already know.  It's a brief and thoroughly enjoyable way to spend a few hours.  However, since the book is a set of essays originally published in the magazine \\"Civilization,\\" the chapters don't GO anywhere; there is no Grand Point or Theme beyond the affection for books.    Fadiman shouldn't be condemned for this, but enjoyed - this book is not an entree but a box of dessert chocolates, delicious if not enough for a full meal.	2004-09-03

Kurson does a remarkable job recounting the story of the men who found and identified a German submarine of the coast of New Jersey.  The story transcends its gripping details to become a story of redemption:  self-interested treasure-hunters in the habit of hauling mementos from shipwrecks (\\"Andrea Doria\\" china and the like) become genuinely interested in the history of the boat, genuinely frightened of the dangers in exploring it, and genuinely respectful of the German sailors who died in it.    From time-to-time Kurson lays it on pretty thick stylistically; the story is so dramatic (several divers died during the search) that it does not need melodramatic prose. There is an interesting but strangely apologetic chapter on the German sailors; Kurson seems a little too eager to prove that many of them had anti-Hitler leanings.  This is surely true, but the story of the lost men, whose bones still rest on the bottom of the Atlantic, is tragic and touching regardless of their politics.    Still, if you like true adventures, you can't do better than this.	2004-09-03

As a youth, the Australian narrator Gerard falls in love with a disabled British girl, Alice, he knows only through letters (and later, email). At the same time, he tries to unravel the mystery of his mother's past in England, through a series of horror stories he discovers his great-grandmother has written.  The narrative of Gerard & Alice's developing love affair is interrupted by these stories, which appear as separate chapters in the novel.    Slowly, creepily, over time, the world of the horror stories and Gerard's own world start to overlap.  Strange coincidences raise the reader's hackles as the stories, written a generation ago, seem to predict what happens in Gerard's own life.  Eventually, Gerard goes to seek out Alice in England, with horrific consequences - an ending that is part Henry James' ghosts and part Jane Eyre's madwoman-in-the-attic.    It's all done with tremendous style; Harwood's ability to set an emotional tone far surpassed my expectations.  However, as a narrator Gerard is a puzzle.   Gerard narrates the novel himself, which makes for a very vivid but very confusing story.      You, the reader, will realize something is fishy about the stories and the girlfriend long, long before poor hapless Gerard.  Why in the world doesn't he suspect something is wrong?  You may lose patience with his naivete.   You may also be confused by the end--You've figured out the whodunit, but Gerard still has it wrong.  The ending is also the only point in which Harwood's fine style gets a little campy.  Read this ending sloooooowwwly; Gerard's understanding will finally catch up to yours.      But will he survive it (cue the Twilight Zone theme here!)???	2004-08-23

What a pleasure to discover, when finally picking up the book in my middle age, that the people who inhabit this book spring fully grown directly from the mind of Harper Lee herself, rather than just the actors in the film.   <br /> <br />Harper Lee has written not a single one-dimensional character, and has created a few of the best realized and strongest characters ever put into print: not just Atticus, Jem, and Scout Finch, but also the dignified Calpurnia, the eager Dill, the peaceful but ghostly Boo Radley, even the degraded and predatory Ewell family.  These characters jump off the page like in no other novel I can recall.  There is no doubt in my mind that these folks are as real as any of the people I see walking down the street, and I feel for Atticus in particular a similar sort of astonished respect as I do for my own father.  <br /> <br />If somehow the book itself has passed you by, or if (sadly) it was imposed on you for a class assignment when you were young, revisit it.  It's one of the best ever written. <br />	2004-08-16

(Miller is well-known as the author of novels such as \\"The Good Mother.\\") Thus, \\"The Story of My Father\\" rises above the sad story of her father's decline (a story whose outlines will be familiar to many of us) and gives us more, a touching portrait of the man her father was throughout his life. <br /> <br />I did not learn anything new about Alzheimer's from reading this book.  But I think most of us read books like this not for the medical facts, but for the sense that we are not alone, that other people have been there, too.  If that describes you well, you will find \\"The Story of My Father\\" a very sympathetic choice. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-12

Dexter is a blood-spatter technician with the Miami PD, a perfect job for someone who cuts live people up as a hobby, I suppose!      Relative to Hannibal, Dexter is actually fairly likeable, and the reader finds him/herself strangely &quot;on Dexter's side&quot; as he simultaneously admires and tries to find the killer.

On the surface this is a story about a boy's unwitting involvement in facilitating a love affair at the turn of the century (1899 or so), told retrospectively by that boy as a man in his 60s.   <br /> <br />On a deeper level one could say it's about our capacity for self-deception, or about the agonies of going from the intense and uncomplicated pleasures of childhood to the tortuous emotions of adulthood.  But this makes the book sound detached and overly literary, which it's definitely not.  It's involving and dramatic instead. <br /> <br />Hartley's commanding style makes this story extremely gripping; because it's told in retrospect the narrator is as articulate as an adult, yet the emotions expressed (and somehow the ones the reader feels) are the intense and confused ones of a child.  Everything seems vivid and yet nothing is completely understandable, just as it is for us as children.   <br /> <br />This lends the book a very bittersweet feeling and a magnificent aura of mystery.  It's hard to imagine this book will ever go out of style.	2004-07-22

Remarkably though, the main thing I'll remember about this book is the sense it conveys of Heimo's redemption (lost and alcoholic, he came to Alaska to trap in the 70s, but dried up and built a family there), and of the love and affection of a family who have no one but each other for months on end.  This is a real testament to Campbell's skill as a journalist and author.<br />The adventure and drama of the Arctic keep the reader turning pages like a good mystery but the after-effect is one of love and integrity.	2004-07-16

One of the first grads of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, she married the naturalist Olaus Murie and honeymooned in the Arctic.  Over the years, fearless Mardy even took her infant children on expeditions into the wild.  <br />The book is an indivisible combination of autobiography and nature writing.  Murie has a remarkable eye; her descriptive powers rival McPhee's but her tone is more one of powerful affection  rather than awe.  My favorite story was of a young teenage Mardy, on her way to the Lower 48 to go to high school, catching the last mail sled out of town in the spring of 1918. This spring trip took many days; at each river crossing there was a possibility of not making it over the thinning ice.  <br />What an adventure! Combined with that adventure is a powerful romance, the lifelong relationship between Olaus, a professional naturalist; Mardy, the fearless and intrepid companion; and Alaska herself.<br />Mardy Murie died only last year, at age 101.  If you read this book, you will regret having just missed her; she deserves to be missed.	2004-07-15

In &quot;Hat Full of Sky,&quot; a sequel to his kids? hit &quot;Wee Free Men,&quot; he manages all these plus more from a pre-teen perspective. However, you?ll really want to read the first volume (&quot;Wee Free&quot;), first, or the plot of &quot;Hat&quot; won't make as much sense to you.      In the previous volume, Tiffany Aching, a young independent farmgirl with witch-like powers, overcomes an evil queen to rescue her brother with the help of a clan of drunken, riotous &quot;Pictsies,&quot; six-inch kilt-wearing men painted blue and swearing like truckers. In &quot;Hat Full of Sky,&quot; Tiffany goes off for formal witch training, only to be taken over by a &quot;hiver,&quot; an evil being who stirs up all one's worst urges. Under the hiver's temporary influence, Tiffany becomes a kind of &quot;mean girl,&quot; pushy, self-interested, inconsiderate, and obsessed with clothes.      It strikes me as remarkable that Pratchett (a middle-aged man, after all) could get the internal struggle of the pre-teen so exactly right: wanting to be popular and able to satisfy every urge, but with a wee small voice inside, fighting those urges in favor of a better self.      As in &quot;Wee Free Men,&quot; the Pictsies are terrifically funny; the best bit is when the Pictsies climb over each other like acrobats and throw on human clothes to disguise themselves (as a single human) for a journey: they confound their fellow-travelers when the stomach complains out loud to the head, and the gloved hands walk off in opposite directions.      Both full- and pint-sized readers will laugh and enjoy this book!	2004-07-08

It is a wonderful addition for some, a cause for disgust in others, and a complete surprise to everybody.<br />Christopher Moore's story claims to be a new Gospel written by one Levi, known as &quot;Biff,&quot; who was Jesus' best friend from childhood.  A blond, air-headed angel (somehow I see Owen Wilson in the movie) has resurrected him and ensconced him in the Hyatt-Regency Saint Louis to write a new Gospel (while the Angel becomes addicted to soap operas).  Biff writes a wacky, profane story about how Jesus, accompanied by Biff, grew from a kind of pipsqueak six-year-old to become truly the Messiah-with special emphasis on the years between childhood and the beginning of his ministry, during which Moore asserts that Jesus and Biff sought out the three Magi.  On the road (like a Biblical Bob Hope and Bing Crosby), they spend years in a magical Confucian stronghold carved into a mountain (populated by lusty whipsmart concubines with martial arts skills straight out of a Tarentino movie), as well as in a Tibet-like Buddhist monastery (where Biff learns to move like lightning and Jesus becomes a bodhisattva), and finally visiting India.  In the process Jesus becomes the Messiah and Biff....well, Biff becomes the inventor of sarcasm.<br />Now, as to the butter-vs-frogs analogy:  I'm a religious liberal, and to me Moore's book is real farce.  It's the funniest book I've ever read, and parts of it are so funny they will have many people actually gasping for air from laughter (and Jesus' attempt to dictate the Beatitudes to Biff is the single funniest passage of the funniest book).  So for me this book is real butter on my popcorn.<br />Moreover, because Moore is grappling with a genuine theological puzzle - how Jesus could be fully man and fully god at the same time - even believing Christians who can read the book at armslength will find something interesting.  Theologically, the &quot;fully man&quot; part has always been hard to appreciate, since part of what makes us human (lust, say, or incomprehension, or even, I'm amazed to say, flatulence) seems to be entirely outside Jesus' historical existence.  Moore's take on Jesus was that he had to learn (as all true humans must do) how to grow into his calling, yet the premise of the book is, indisputably, that Jesus WAS the Messiah.  So behind the laughter Moore is, in his way, trying to suggest one possible solution to this very old theological problem.<br />But to a final group - those who are offended by a humorous approach to their faith - you folks will just hate this. Honest, you'll be deeply offended. If you see someone reading &quot;Lamb,&quot; and rolling on the floor, just stay clear.  For you this is popcorn with a dead frog in it. <br />Everybody else, please read this!	2004-07-08

Cray also does a marvelous job giving us a sense of Guthrie's work, liberally sprinkling his text with lyrics from familiar and unfamiliar songs.  The result is not only complete and comprehensive but very sympathetic, despite details (wandering, neglecting his children, womanizing, drinking, fighting, etc.) that bring Guthrie down a peg from the sainthood that some might want to give him.<br />Guthrie himself seems a knotty reflection of the troubled times in which his music first arose:  the struggles of the working poor during the Great Depression, followed by the paranoia of McCarthyism in the late 40s and beyond.   Both Guthrie and his music showed a kind of restless, kinetic energy until this second period set in, but then dissolve in a kind of undisciplined confusion.<BR> <BR>We know now of course that this change in Guthrie was caused by his disease, Huntington's chorea, which hospitalized him for the last decade or more of his life.  Cray does an exceptionally good job of showing the gradual increase of the disease from the point where its earlier symptoms just seemed like a quirky part of Guthrie's personality to the point where his internal fight against it made him violent, and finally to the point where he was rendered speechless and immobile.  Guthrie's second wife Marjorie (Arlo's mother) comes off fairly saintly, visiting Guthrie with their kids weekly in the hospital for years even after their divorce.  <br />In sum, the book is inspirational, informative, and poignant as well.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is its length, which fans of Guthrie will not find daunting but which may be more than you are looking for it you are only a casual reader.	2004-06-14

McGinniss casts an urban reporter's jaundiced eye, for example, toward the drinking and drugs that seem like an inevitable consequence of people in the cold wilderness with nothing to do and some money.<br />Sometimes he intends to be virtually comic, as when a newbie pipefitter offloads his pickup truck from the ferry in a Panhandle town unconnected to the rest of the world by road, or when a drug-addled prostitute runs in to a travel agency in Valdez, Alaska, pointing a gun at the travel agent demanding an immediate trip out of town (to get away from creditors).  The agent settles her down and puts her in his truck--as though this sort of thing happened everyday-- while he finishes out his conversation with McGinniss inside. <br />A long essay documenting McGinniss' trip to the far northern Brooks Range is dominated by his fear of bears (that's logical, I guess) and his city-slicker mountaineering inabilities, although it eventually rises to suggest the majesty of the land he was touring.<br />In contrast to John McPhee's &quot;Coming into the Country,&quot; written in the same era, McGinniss seems determined to remain a sardonic outsider, an observer of people and their weaknesses primarily, rather than an observer of nature.  It's an insightful approach although I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of real Alaskans objected to it, and certainly I am hoping to avoid the gun-toting ladies of the evening on my upcoming trip to tour the state.	2004-06-11

It does have a bittersweet, nostalgic feel to it, written from the perspective of an old writer/professor, much like Stegner, near the end of his life and looking back on what came before.  The plot of the book involves the enduring friendship of two young couples, wed in the 1930s.  Sid is a likeable fellow who struggles to gain academic acceptance and tenure, married to Charity, a well-to-do extrovert who micromanages his career.  Larry, the narrator, is a naturally gifted novelist, married to the sweet-tempered Sally.<br />The novel follows their lives through small wins (the acceptance of a novel) and near tragedies.  This part moves in a smooth, elegiac way-you get the sense of Stegner's genuine affection for these characters-but I did not find the characters exceptional in any way.  I confess, for example, to getting a small bee in my bonnet about the complete absence of the couples' children from most of the narrative.  Sid and Charity's five kids and Larry and Sally's daughter are generally off-stage, under the care of a nanny.<br />But then a kind of tidal wave hits, with all the skill Stegner can muster.  The impending death of one of the characters brings out the conflicts inherent in even the most enduring of marriages; I know of no place in literature where the joys and sorrows of a marriage are portrayed with such precision and intensity.  The way kindness and inadvertent cruelty seem all knotted up together; the way you can't live life apart; the way the intense abiding love of one person also makes you terribly vulnerable.  These Stegner gets exactly, truly right.  <br />Read through to this remarkable end; it will be worthwhile.	2004-06-01

In a first chapter that is a masterpiece of simple story-telling, she structures the fantastic story: \\"Captain\\" William Bligh (in fact, he was only a lieutenant) commanded the HMS Bounty to Tahiti, suffered the mutiny of part of his crew, and navigated a simple row-boat across many thousands of miles of the Pacific to be rescued.  A second voyage, undertaken by the HMS Pandora, discovered many mutineers on a distant island, taking them into custody, only to be broken up in a terrible storm, its survivors (crew and prisoners) enduring a second open-boat voyage to safety.  On return to England a length court-martial condemned many of the mutineers to death, but left unscathed young Peter Heywood, convicted but later pardoned.<br />The traditional view of things (i.e. the one you `know' from the movie versions) has Bligh as a torturer, the famous Fletcher Christian as a defender of the ordinary sailor's rights, and Heywood as an innocent bystander.  Through careful reading of seemingly every contemporary document-including every bit of the trial transcripts-Alexander subverts the story to one of privilege rebelling against authority:  whereas Bligh came from a family of extremely modest means, Christian and Heywood both came from old and well-connected families who, after the courtmartial, ensured their own good names by besmirching Bligh's.<br />This is not sensational journalism but careful scholarship, and even if you don't agree with Alexander's `take' on the subject, you will enjoy hearing the sailor's own first-person narratives, as well as Alexander's careful reconstruction of what actually occurred.  <br />This book was nominated for the National Book Critic's Circle award for non-fiction; it was richly deserved.  \\"HMS Bounty\\" receives my highest endorsement as well!	2004-05-25
US	53079427	RBKE5B9KIJJK1	0374522871	31986107	Coming into the Country	Books	4	103	104	N	N	Fascinating reporting on an Alaska that no longer exists	In the mid 1970s, John McPhee turned his powers of description toward Alaska at a time when the &quot;Alaskan way of life&quot; was under siege.  Alaska had been a state less than 20 years.   The claims of natives to the land had been resolved by putting millions of acres in the hands of native corporations.  The old &quot;tradition&quot; of immigrants to the land being able to plop down and build a cabin almost anywhere was disappearing under the burden of new regulations.  Huge new national parks were designated, and at the same time the pipeline was being constructed, highlighting the old conflict between development and ecology, between preservation and self-determination.<br />Sadly, the Alaska that McPhee wrote about no longer exists.  In the first segment, he writes about the Brooks Range wilderness, and discusses the controversy around establishing the &quot;Gates of the Arctic&quot; National Park there.  That park is now established.  In the second segment, he writes about the aftereffects of the decision to move the state capital from Juneau to somewhere north of Anchorage.  That move never occurred.  In the third (and longest and most compelling) segment, he reports on the lives of the people of isolated Eagle, Alaska, a town that today boasts a fax machine.<br />The third segment is where McPhee's writing really shines: I don't think anyone has ever conveyed the personality of Alaska and Alaskans as well as McPhee has.  My favorite was the story of how one man and his son managed to get an entire C9 Caterpillar bulldozer into the middle of nowhere, clearing their way through 70-foot winter drifts, to set up a gold dredging operation.  McPhee conveys the extreme beauty and wildness of the place, and the fire and determination of the people to belong to it.<br />I was sad but impressed to find McPhee accurately foretelling the Exxon Valdez tragedy by predicting that an oil spill in Prince William Sound was the greatest threat to Alaska's environmental health.  However, McPhee's account is remarkably balanced; if you're looking for polemic (either pro or anti-environmentalism, for example), you won't find it.  <br />In sum, I give this book five stars for the quality of the writing and the insight, but four for being somewhat dated.  If you want to learn more about what Alaska was like, you couldn't do better than this, but if you want to know what it's like NOW, you might prefer to supplement this otherwise wonderful book with something else.	2004-05-25

But instead she has written a simple, short book on the unlikely topic of punctuation.  If you are the sort of person who cringes when someone writes a phrase like \\"the penguin has it's detractors,\\" you will occasionally find yourself pumping your fist in the air exclaiming \\"Yes! Yes!\\" in agreement with Truss's no-nonsense, no-excuses, laff-riot approach.<br />If you have little interest in punctuation-or even if you are frightened and suspicious of it-Truss is still worth a go.  Her objective is to convince you that punctuation is a thoughtful friend rather than a dictator.  For example, consider these alternative phrases and their varying interpretations, from Handel's Messiah:<br />\\"Comfort ye my people\\" (please go out and comfort my people) versus<BR>\\"Comfort ye, my people\\" (just cheer up, you lot; it might never happen)<br />Pretty different, eh? Without the comma, poor Handel risked being misunderstood.  <br />Truss is humorous rather than unforgiving; she even permits Americans their habit (strange to the British) of putting closing quotes after all other punctuation, and their preference for the \\"Oxford comma.\\" <br />And if you want to know what an \\"Oxford comma\\" is, read the book and be wittily enlightened.	2004-05-21

This was the greatest theme I took away from Adam Nicolson's \\"Sea Room,\\" the story of the three tiny, uninhabited Shiant (say \\"Shant\\") Islands in the Hebrides of Scotland, which Nicholson inherited from his father (the famed author Nigel Nicolson, the son of Vita Sackville-West).  <br />Nicolson's approach to describing the islands for his readers resembles John McPhee's:  it's an engaging blend of natural history (how were the islands formed?), human history (who lived here and why?), archaeology, and ecology (how do the animals and plants of the Shiants form a whole world?).  The difference is that Nicolson's passion for place is quite specific:  he loves the Shiants like one loves one's parents, infinitely and irreplaceably.  You can't imagine him running off and writing a second book about another place.<br />Nicolson's prose is lyric and detailed at the same time; despite the length (350 pages and more), the story never flags.  At the end of the book, Nicholson defends his continued private ownership of the islands (many feel they should be a public trust); I wasn't convinced, but I respected his strong urge to transmit his love of the place to his son and future generations of his family.<br />By the way, Nicholson publicly offers the keys to his cottage to anyone desiring to stay there (his e-mail address is in the book); but consider first that rats seem now to be part of the natural ecology of the place.  But perhaps that won't phase you (it doesn't phase Nicholson a bit!).	2004-05-10

This is the best-written, most entertaining history book I've read in ages. What an amazing story!  In January 1897, a message went out from Dawson City in the isolated Yukon Territory of Canada: gold had been discovered!  It took until July for anyone to notice, but then it seemed like the whole world stampeded toward the Klondike.  Most did not make it over the mountains before winter, but were stuck in lawless Skagway, Alaska, enduring frostbite, graft, and privation, until arriving in Dawson in June of 1898.  Suddenly, Dawson went from a few tents to as many as 10,000 people; then, in August of 1899, a rumor of gold in Nome, Alaska emptied the town as quickly as a fire:  8,000 people left in the course of a week.    Berton spins a mighty good yarn: careless prospectors paying for drinks with gold dust; dance-hall girls; wiley villains like the infamous Soapy Smith, boss of Skagway's underworld; heroic Mounties keeping order over treacherous mountain passes.  All of this is the result of an enormous amount of primary research: in the 1950's Berton personally interviewed a large number of the last survivors of the stampede, and appears to have memorized every printed word, published and unpublished, ever written on the subject.    Berton caps off his expert handling of the narrative with a wonderful chapter reflecting on the meaning of the Klondike rush for the American and Canadian national characters.  I was charmed to discover, at the very end, that Berton's parents were prospectors and that he himself grew up in Dawson, almost a ghost town, playing among the abandoned gold dredges and cast-off dance slippers.    This 2001 version of \\"Klondike\\" is significantly updated from the 1958 original; it's considerably longer and reflects many new primary sources.  \\"Klondike Fever\\" still available via Amazon (ISBN 0786713178), is the older and less up-to-date book.  This 2001 edition is the one you want!	2004-05-10

The series features the Nomes, small creatures no more than a few inches high.  In \\"Truckers,\\" a small clan of nomes abandons their harsh outdoor life to move into an aging department store (Arnold Bros. Est. 1905).  There they discover an entire metropolis of other nomes-complete with a bizarre class structure and an eccentric religion worshiping the Arnold Bros. as deities-who believe the department store to be the entire universe and deny the existence of the Outside, from which our clan came.<br />All the nomes must abandon the Store when it is slated for demolition; \\"Truckers,\\" contains the story of their escape.  The second volume, \\"Diggers\\", describes their attempt to carve out a life in an abandoned quarry.  In the third volume, \\"Wings,\\" we discover that the nomes' ancestors once lived in outer space, as their leader ventures to Florida's NASA Space Center to learn how to return his people to their origins.<br />\\"Truckers\\" is as funny as anything Pratchett has ever written; the send-up of religion, supporting the theme of believing in what can't be seen, combines with slapstick farce.  (At one point the six-inch-high nomes successfully train themselves to drive a human-size truck only to forget to open the garage door before exiting the garage.)  \\"Diggers\\" is somewhat witty, whereas \\"Wings\\" is a lesser effort.  This third volume spends most of its time apart from the various characters that make the nome community entertaining reading.<br />Still, as always, worth the read!	2004-05-10

In the first two books, it does not seem to matter:  the riotous humor comes from the entertaining idea that cows would go on strike to get electric blankets, or that ducks would argue for a diving board.<br />\\"Duck for President\\" the humor seems geared almost exclusively to the grown-ups, or at least to much, much older children.  Duck leaves the farm to run for public office, so we lose the funny interactions between all the animals and their farm humans.  My daughter would have preferred more of this compared to the details of Duck's runs for mayor governor and President.<br />I get the sense that the enormous talents of Cronin and Lewin were twisted towards this topic by an editor with an eye for election-year sales. ...	2004-03-29

Paco Underhill follows up on his immensely successful &quot;Why We Buy&quot; with an anthropologist's tour of shopping malls and Americans' obsessions with them.<br />Underhill is worth his weight in gold to retailers; many of the simple ideas he throws away in this volume would be incredibly useful to shoppers and thus worth money to retailers (for example, clothes displayed shoulder-out on racks are annoying because you can't see what they look like from the front: why not angle them so they can be seen?)<br />He eventually takes on the longer-term topic of whether malls have a long-term future in the U.S., at least in their current configuration.<br />Underhill has adopted a casual conversational tone, as though he were chatting to you as his personal companion (or transcribing an audiotape of his thoughts), perhaps in order to make the book enjoyable to read.  He succeeds at this readability goal, but the book seems somehwat insubstantial because of it: there's even one chapter that's only a page and a half long, on Aquamassage stores.<br />As much as I liked this book, I wish he cut some of this trivia out.  Like a nosh at the food court, you end up wishing that you'd had a full meal.	2004-03-22

He lives in the attic of his master's house, unloved by everyone except Mrs. Underwood, his master's wife.  Seeking revenge for past humiliations, he instructs his djinn (genie) Bartimeus to steal a magic amulet from Simon Lovelace, the most powerful magician in London.  Thus begins a Mission-Impossible type adventure to prevent Lovelace from recovering the amulet and using it in a grand, take-over-the-world type of evil scheme.<br />If you have been resisting Bartimeus because it sounds like a Harry Potter wannabe, don't-read it now.  Although the parallels are obvious--a world of magicians, an orphan apprentice battling a supreme evil--the author is not out to mimic Potter but to offer a different and more pessimistic vision of what a magical world would be like.  In Harry Potter's world, magicial ability is a sort of genetic artifact; there are good, evil, and silly magicians - just as in the `human' world; and themes of the importance of family and friends predominate.<br />Bartimeus' vision is much, much darker.  Nathaniel lives in a world where magicians are a dominating ruling class, who thirst for wealth and power, and who will stop at nothing to get it.  But all their power stems not from innate ability but from the ability to control the spirits (genies, imps, and the like) that populate the natural world.  Here, the wizards are always on the edge of disaster created by losing control over these spirits.  One word wrong in an incantation means disaster!  There are no beneficent Dumbledore-like wizards here; all - and this includes Nathaniel - are driven by personal gain, revenge, and anger.<br />For all its darkness, author Jonathan Stroud has crafted an extremely well-paced and exciting book.  Get past the first 40 pages or so and you won't be able to put it down until youfind out just what evil Lovelace is up to and whether Nathaniel will be able to stop him.  The ending is deliciously ambiguous - not all the villains are captured; a mysterious Resistance seems to be forming among the non-magical humans; Nathaniel may succumb to his own lust for power; and the sarcastic and clever djinn Bartimeus seems likely to reappear in future volumes.  As Bartimeus is the first volume of the \\"Amulet of Samarkand\\" trilogy, surely there is more excitement to come.<br />Not, however, for people who thought that Harry Potter was dark or scary - if Harry disturbed you, this one will keep you checking under the bed at night and sleeping with the lights on.	2004-02-09

It is the story of a lonely little mouse, rejected by his family, who falls in love with the young Princess who rules the castles in which he lives.  <br />Here are some reasons we really liked the book:<br />1) DiCamillo is a true romantic; Despereaux the mouse loves Pea the Princess with a love that is overwhelming and courtly (like a medieval knight), a love that makes him want to be a better person.  At the same time, the author is not afraid to toss in some real Adventure and even Peril - the mouse must brave the dungeon, its murderous clan of rats, and a sad but frightening orphan girl named Miggery Sow who means to kidnap the princess and take her place.  Scary enough to be exciting but not scary enough for nightmares.<br />2) Although DiCamillo's writing style is highly sophisticated, she stops along the way to explain the unusual and interesting words she uses (\\"perfidy,\\" for one), so the book is comprehensible even to kids too young to read it themselves.  <br />3) The illustrations are charming and many, to keep younger listeners/readers entertained.  The chapters are also short enough to make good bed-time stories by themselves.<br />One caution though - although my 9-year-old son would have been able to tackle this on his own, the heavy romantic nature of the story (even though it's between a mouse and a girl) put him off.  It's probably a much more appealing book to girls than boys. But even for some boys, the adventure will make it worth the while.	2004-01-27

First we have to hear about the history of European exploration to Java.  Then we do a little geology.  No wait, then some more history.  THEN the explosion.  Then some outrageous claims about the impact of the explosion on modern culture. (Winchester earnestly believes that Krakatoa prefigures Marshall McLuhan.  I'm not joking.) Then some more geology, this time featuring Winchester's own visit to the remains of the island.<br />Winchester never met a detail he didn't like, even if it isn't relevant to his narrative.  So, we hear not only about the Dutch East India Company, but also its contemporary the Hudson Bay company, which we learn 1) explored North America, 2) was indirectly the founder of a major department store chain in Canada, and 3) rather a lot about the eccentricities of the current owner of that chain.  <br />Footnotes abound, but not the kind that document the source of any of Winchester's claims, the kind where the information provided has nothing to do with the main story. <br />However, you will find this book reasonably worthwhile if you can train yourself to think of Winchester as the barmy old uncle by the fire, spinning a yarn or two or ten.  You put up with him because his details are entertaining.  If you don't have all night to listen to Uncle Simon though, you'd better go elsewhere.	2004-01-26

The villain then kidnapped Meggie's mom. Meggie and her dad must find them and trick them back into the book.<br />Although Inkheart is a long book (500+ pages), Funke establishes the thrills and the threat in the book's premise almost immediately, on a dark and stormy night and the day following when Meggie and her dad first try to make their escape.  The narrative continues to an isolated village in Italy where Meggie encounters a menagerie of minor evil characters who have also escaped from the book.<br />Meggie is an engaging and spunky heroine that will appeal to both boy and girl readers.  <br />A nice feature of the book is its general love for books - dad Mo is a bookbinder, aunt Elinor is a book collector with a huge library.  Clearly Funke is not a lightweight trying to cash in on the Harry Potter fantasy kick; she conveys her love of books and language in a way that will enthuse any reader from 8 to 80.	2004-01-26

Farmer seems to spend half of his year on the Harvard faculty as an infectious disease specialist, half the year managing other worldwide health programs targeted to the poor through his organization Partners in Health, and half his year at the clinic.  If you added that up to three halves of a year, that's intentional on Kidder's part:  Farmer is entirely tireless and seems to work as hard as six ordinary people.<br />The focus of the book's narrative is really Farmer himself.  Kidder seems fascinated with Farmer as a person:  his background growing up in Florida, on boats and in trailers, a step up from poverty himself.  His early experiences in Haiti.  His eccentricities and even his romances.  Kidder does not exactly make Farmer seem saint-like (he's definitely capable of losing his temper), but he does seem to have cast him as the hero of an adventure movie of some sort.<br />Beyond the hero, though (maybe Matt Damon in the movie?  Jude Law?) there is a more important, serious message about the perilously entwined nature of poverty and health-care.  To Farmer (and Kidder) providing sub-standard healthcare to the 3rd-wolrd poor is not merely injust, it is also ineffective.<br />Read this book, then go on to read something more by Farmer, who is a great writer in his own right: Ineffections and Inequalities, for example.  Although the heroic part of Kidder's book makes the book highly readable, the real benefit to reading the book for me personally has been motivating me to learn more about this essential subject.	2004-01-26

I'm impressed that the basic science in the story is accurately presented - the stages of the butterfly's life, its migration, its mating (gingerly and sweetly handled as a \\"dance\\" between butterflies) and its eventual return home.<br />My daughter loved this so much we donated a copy to her pre-school, where they watch monarch butterflies hatch in a terrarium every year.

Maybe that sounds easy to do when you're writing about, say, the spiritual life of a cloistered nun, as he did in his recent novel &quot;Lying Awake.&quot;<br />In &quot;True Notebooks,&quot; you might think he has taken on too big a task: he wants you to understand and appreciate the imprisoned Los Angeles teenagers he supervises in the &quot;Inside Out Writers&quot; program in LA Central jail.  He does this by describing a year or more of biweekly readings of his jailhouse writers group.  Inmates come, write, live out the details of their cases, and then, sadly, eventually disappear into the adult justice system.<br />He doesn't sugarcoat or sentimentalize these kids' stories--he understands and acknowledges the pain their crimes have caused, and he writes about their victims too.  But by doing such a marvelous job showing how his subjects grow and change through their experiences, he forces you to see them as real and human.  You will be astonished and saddened by the quality of their writing, and hold your own children closer as a result.	2004-01-01

His descriptions of the Botswana countryside are as evocative as any &quot;nature&quot; writer's, and his ability to create interesting, entertaining, and complex characters is unparalleled.  Precious, Mr. Maketoni, and Mma Makutsi are so clearly drawn that you would know them instantly if you met them on the street.

How did the Pisani family live in its villa?  How did Palladio integrate the main house of the Villa Badoer with its farm buildings?  How did Palladio himself interact with his clients?  Above all, what did it feel like to live in buildings that were both magnificent designs and truly &quot;home&quot; to their owners?<br />The book is so vibrant and Rybczynski's passion for his subject so profound you will want to jump on a plane tomorrow to see what he has seen!	2003-12-02

Although it is non-fiction, &quot;Colossus&quot; is as vibrant and impressionistic as Whitehead's novels.  <br />Whitehead's prose style perfectly captures the buzz and hustle of the city; it's spare, bitter, and funny. The short, even choppy text changes perspective from sentence to sentence:  in a chapter on subways, for example, you're in one passenger's head, then another, then another.  The effect gives the same sensation as New York itself: a swarm of individuals making up the hive.<br />Everything Whitehead has to say about his city is apt: New York regulars and occasional visitors will find the shock of recognition on every page.  My own favorite, about a subway car full of strangers: &quot;If you don't know what time it is, wait for a peek while he changes his grip.&quot;  If you have not tried that yourself, you should spend more time in NYC.	2003-12-02

What I enjoyed most about the first one, &quot;The Eyre Affair,&quot; was the combining of a thriller-type plot with a literary 'angle' (in Thursday's world the cops chase the criminals in and out of books).<br />In this sequel, Fforde emphasizes the fantastical over the literary:  Thursday's world now include such non-literary elements as a race of cloned Neanderthals confined to menial labor, a transportation system that sends you from one side of the wo5rld to the other directly through the earth's core, and a corporation so powerful that it can erase people from history entirely.  <br />This is all highly entertaining but readers who loved the first book for its literary references will have to wait until later (roughly page 163), when Fforde introduces a new cluster of literary characters, including Miss Havisham (from Great Expectations) as the wiley leader of a posse of fictional cops policing the world of literature itself.  <br />Even the more 'classical' reader will be rewarded by sticking with the book past this halfway point.	2003-12-02

Thus, Thursday must chase her villain in and out of the novel Jane Eyre.<br />To accomodate this, Fforde has created a slightly alternative universe for Thursday: a world similar to modern-day Britain, with a few facts charmingly skewed:  the Crimean war has been going on for 154 years, people use airships rather than airplanes to get around, and the world has a general fixation with literature in general--manuscripts are worth more than gemstones, and so many people change their name to those of famous authors that they have to be numbered (byron01, 02 and the like).<br />If you are a booklover, you will find this twinning of literature and thriller very amusing...a little less so (but only a little) if only one of those genres is up your alley.  Regardless, Fforde is funny and efferverscent throughout.	2003-12-02

Subsequently the children are kidnapped by pirates; the book follows their story until their eventual return to England.  The pirates turn out to be, for the most part, well-intended and even protective of the children, but by the end of the story the same cannot really be said of the children themselves, whose behavior at points seems threatening and malevolent by comparison to their captors.<br />Others have made a comparison between this book and \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" both because of their stories of children torn apart from the moorings of civilization, and for their undercurrent emotion of malevolence, darkness, and evil.  To my mind, Hughes' intent is broader than that, and I actually prefer \\"High Wind\\" to its rival. Hughes is also exploring a more general theme of alienation and the kind of moral emptiness that accompanies it:  child vs. adult, plantation owners vs. slaves, the wild of Jamaica vs. the civilized form of the British Empire, each unknowing and thus cruel to the other.<br />The ending is actually shocking, a perfect end to this highly unconventional but perfectly-pitched book.  One of my \\"best ever\\" novels.	2003-10-31

Those of us obsessed with Venice will read anything set there, but this will give you relatively little about Venice and relatively more than you want to know about Ms. Weidger's ability to get the best of her landlord.<br />If you or I lived such a life, and kept a diary about it, the diary might be just as full of the petty annoyances of our day-to-day lives: squabbles with the landlords, constant annoyance with malfunctioning appliances, down-the-nose observations about the fashion choices of other women, and a general self-obsession. It's what diaries are for, in a way. Weideger's error is not in having written 300+ pages of self-obsession but in publishing it.<br />I'm not sorry I read it (that's how much of a Venice-lover I am), but the rest of you might be better off heading for the local library than opening your wallet for this one.	2003-10-26

So the reader doesn't know what, if anything, to believe.<br />There is a lot of bizarre speculation on the author's part:  the courtesan La Paiva, born to a Jewish family in Russia, may or may not have been baptized at age seven.  Rounding doubts the baptism because the book she read it in is not a very accurate one.  Nevertheless, she continues on, speculating about the REASON for this possible event, but offers no hard evidence for her speculation. Apollonie Sabatier may or may not have slept with Baudelaire; Rounding speculates on why the \\"possible\\" affair ended.  At this I threw up my hands: the book is full of such idle speculations about the reasons behind events that only possibly occured.<br />To me, the real fascination behind these women was \\"why these women and not others;\\" what was the magnetic attraction that held men spellbound?  Rounding has made a very readable book, but we are still waiting for a more energetic scholar to write one that really answers this question.	2003-10-07

She writes without the condescension that sometimes mars others in this genre, and her descriptive prose is really outstanding.  You really get a sense of the smell, the light, the &quot;feel&quot; of life on a small Scottish croft (farm).  <br />My main caution is that &quot;Loud Halo&quot; is the 3rd of a series of books on the same subject, so I did feel a little as though I had been dropped into the middle of a conversation; characters presumably carefully introduced in the earlier volumes Beckwith assumes you know well at this point, which is sometimes a bit confusing.  Thus, you might be better off starting with &quot;The Hills Is Lonely&quot; then carrying on only if Beckwith suits you (I predict she will).	2003-10-03

But &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot; is not going to end up on my Favorite Discworlds shortlist.  It takes place in the unfamiliar land of Borogravia, with characters new to the series (although Sam Vimes and Angua put in a very modest appearance), so I miss the wealth of local detail that goes into the more familiar Ankh-Morpork-based novels.  Even compared to, say, &quot;Jingo,&quot; much of which is also set abroad, Borogravia is a bit less, um, colorful.<br />Pratchett does a nice job making the plot topical (the divisions in Borogravia seem more-or-less Yugoslavian to me), but the setting and the characters seem like they will need another novel or two to come to reach their full Pratchett-osity.	2003-10-01

You all already have your opinions.  I just want to make a particular pitch for the audio version.<br />We listened to the audio version non-stop on a 9-hour car trip, and it was the only book I've ever encountered that could make the drive through Northern Indiana genuinely entertaining.  My apologies to the great city of Fort Wayne, but it's true. I strongly urge you to get the audiobook version, since a great part of the humor comes from Franken's comic delivery (he reads his own text in the audio version).  The audiobook also adds value to the printed page by using the actual audioclips of events reported in the text, such as speeches as Sen. Paul Wellstone's funeral.<br />Regardless of whether you are liberal or conservative, if you don't have a sense of humor, stay away from Al Franken's book.	2003-09-30

Tudor truly didn't seem to have a good head for business, but the fundamental economics of the trade were so strong that he eventually flourished.  Take something that you can get for practically free (ice).  Hire farm workers laid off for the winter (they'll work for practically nothing).  Pack it with something that people want to get rid of (sawdust).  Transport it in ships that would otherwise be carrying only ballast (they'll carry it cheap).<br />Tudor appears to have been more-or-less an irascible nut, whose initial forays into shipping ice were disastrous (he forgot, for example, that no one in the Carribean had a place to store it, so that the first purchasers could do nothing more with their blocks of ice than carry them home gingerly in their aprons and watch them melt).  As a sideline, he tried to corner the US coffee market and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and alienated everyone who could help him gain a technological edge over his competitors.<br />In sum, Tudor is a fascinating character, but the trade itself is even more interesting then he was.  Weightman's narrative is well-researched, charming, and swift.  It would make an excellent choice for anyone interested in history but also a great change-of-pace for anyone interested in business in general.	2003-09-29

Bainbridge does a fine job dramatizing the deaths of the five doomed members of Robert Falcon Scott's Antarctic Polar Expedition, in five separate chapters, each written in the voice of a different one of the five men.  Bainbridge is obviously well-versed in the details of the true story, and the book hews closely to the facts of the case.<br />She's at her best in articulating the sort of self-absorbed England-forever attitude of the officers, but her depiction of ordinary seaman Edgar &quot;Taff&quot; Evans falls short; he speaks with almost the same Oxbridge vocabulary as his captain.<br />Despite this weaker one-fifth of the book, the book overall is quite appealing in the way it conveys a strong sense of the physical place, Antarctica.  You can just imagine the sharp intake of frozen air into your lungs as you fall down a crevasse to the end of your harness, waiting for your companions to pull you back to safety.	2003-09-24

Mawson's story of survival in the Antartic--alone and without food following the death of his companions--is the equal of these more familiar tales and dates from the same era.

The story of how Richard Hannay stumbles upon and then escapes from a pre-WWI German spy plot DOES have that \\"Perils of Pauline\\" flavor to it: in each chapter our hero Hannay seems to get himself in an impossible bind, then magically right out of it again.  (A sample: Hannay is tied up and locked in a windowless shed in which, remarkably, the crooks have left a flashlight (!) and some explosives (!).  And, boom boom, on we go to the next chapter). <br />The underlying scheme is never fully explained (what ARE the Germans up to, why is the visit of the Balkan consul so important, etc.), but it doesn't really matter.  The scent of the heathered hills of Scotland over which Hannay escapes rises from the pages, and the black-and-white specter of the classic movies Alfred Hitchcock made on the basis of this book will run through your mind's eye in the few short hours it will take you to finish it.<br />I agree, however, with others who mention that Buchan's occasional gratuitous anti-Semitism is jarring and put this book beyond the pale for many readers.	2003-09-03

Could there be such a thing as a &quot;slapstick&quot; novel of manners?  This one might qualify, for its humour both witty and broad and its country-house setting.<br />Our highly-educated heroine Flora Poste, intelligent, witty, but fashion-addled, aimless, and seemingly shallow, descends on her rural relatives when her parents die leaving her penniless.  Sharp parodies of rural England, the family includes, among others, an insane matriarch locked in her room, a love-mad and graceless granddaughter, a grandson who plays the same role among the maids that the bull does among the cows, an antique manservant who fails to notice when a cow's leg falls off.  In short order Flora contrives to marry off the granddaughter to a local grandee, packs the grandson off to Hollywood, and generally manages things so craftily that everyone not only lives Happily Ever After but also does so with Good Manners and better haircuts.<br />The most winning feature of Gibbon's book (after the fact that it is hysterically funny) is that she skewers not only the conventions of the 1930s upper classes to which Flora belongs, but also the working class denizens of the farm.  At first everyone seems faintly ridiculous but over time your affections for ALL these characters grows.  By the end you are actually happy to see them all happily settled, and Flora no longer seems like a conniver but a clever and sympathetic heroine-more Elizabeth Bennet than Becky Sharpe.   A very neat trick on the part of the author, and one well worth the discovering.<br />One miniscule note of caution:  Gibbons, writing in the 1930s, sets her novel \\"in the near future,\\" and adds a couple of futuristic features that confuse the casual reader-telephones with televisions in them so you can see the speaker, references to the \\"Anglo-Nicaraguan War\\" and the like.  You may safely ignore them without diminishing the book.	2003-09-03

Cherry-Garrard was a young wealthy Englishman with a longing to test his mettle, who joined the famously doomed Scott expedition to the South Pole.  Despite a complete lack of experience, he proved to be both a stalwart explorer and an excellent writer.<br />Imagine this:  three men pulling their own sleds hundreds of miles across broken ice, living for weeks in temperatures as low as -77 F.  Then, a blizzard.  Then, there tent blows away and they are left in this blizzard with no shelter for more than a day.  How will they ever make it back to the home base?  This particular episode, Cherry's &quot;Winter Journey&quot;, is only a detour on the main narrative about the journal to the Pole.<br />Not only does he convey the &quot;what&quot; - the breathtaking and death-defying details of his experiences, he conveys the &quot;why&quot; - what it meant to him to be there, and why he went.  If you have read elsewhere that the expedition proved to England that its men were still capable of great things, you may have scoffed at this as the last longings of a dying Empire.  But when Cherry-Garrard writes it, it is with utmost sincerity, and you believe him.	2003-08-07

For example, I really enjoyed his essay on &quot;when was Scotland&quot;--i.e., what period in history are people thinking of when they think of when Scotland was most itself, and how the answer to that question has changed over time.  The &quot;highlandization&quot; of Scotland (the sense that it is all ruddy guys in kilts) is a related theme.  <br />A large percent of the volume is given over to a discussion of 'devolution' - the gradual decoupling of Scotland from Great Britain as a whole - including the recent establishment of a separate Scottish Parliament.  This bit will be quite dry for most readers, and pretty difficult to understand if you don't already know a bit about British politics.  Also, the essays as a whole meander a bit and don't have a real sense of direction.  <br />However, I got what I came for - an appreciation of what Scotland is really like &quot;now&quot; - from someone who knows.	2003-08-07

Much of the text takes the form of snippets of dialogue, as though it were a play script.<br />The tone is humorous, even witty, but light as cotton candy.  You won't find anything resembling social commentary or lyrical evocations of the Highlands natural beauty.  Just two young Brits, old pals, teasing each other mercilessly and cracking each other up.  People of Scottish descent may even be perturbed by the authors' tendency to make slight fun of the natives.<br />The humor is nevertheless infectious, and it's fun enough to read (like Bill Bryson in that way).  But the whole book comes to a grinding halt in the last 30 pages, which are devoted to the sermons of some old eccentric 18th-century preacher, connected to the Scotland story only because Boswell was a fan of the sermonizer.  It had roughly the same effect on the previously light-hearted story as if Bryson had replaced the last chapter of \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" with a lengthy discussion of the theology of Cotton Mather.	2003-07-31

The pace is breathtaking but not at the expense of fully realized characters.  <br />I will say, though, that the archaic Scottish dialect is not easy going at first; stick with it though, if you get in 10 pages you will not be able to put it down!	2003-07-07

I bought &quot;Flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; in anticipation of a trip to Scotland, and it was perfect for that purpose. Although it provides an excellent history, it seems designed for the visitor; it's equal parts travel and history. <br />This book gives a day-by-day description of the Prince's 5 months in hiding from the British before he was able to escape to France.  He trekked hundreds of miles on foot, in disguise (once, famously, as a ladies' maid!), sometimes passing within earshot of the soldiers hunting him.  The book is liberally illustrated with modern photographs of the particular glens and mountains Charlie passed by, as well as reproductions of painted portraits, etc. of the main participants.  <br />Even better, each part of Charlie's escape is accompanied by a detailed map showing where he was on almost a night-by-night basis.  In the appendix there are even driving directions and a list of relevant places for tourists to visit.<br />If you don't know the story behind Charlie's daring escape, you could not start at a better place.	2003-06-12

Apsley Cherry-Garrard appears to have been an almost stereotypic member of the British landed gentry of the Edwardian era-affable, proud, wealthy and somewhat aimless-until he talked his way onto Robert Scott's ill-fated Antarctic expedition.  After two years suffering in Antarctica, Cherry returned to his estate in broken health facing an essentially undistinguished future managing his wealth.  <br />But he did not disappear, as you might expect-instead he turned out the memoir \\"The Worst Journey in the World,\\" often acclaimed as the greatest adventure memoir of all time.  <br />Ironically, Cherry's life might at first have seemed an almost featureless existence, punctuated two remarkable events-a life-threatening adventure and a best-selling book.  But author Sara Wheeler does a remarkable job bringing her subject to life both as a sympathetic individual and as a kind of symbol of his era.  The quality of her scholarship is really excellent - she has left no paper relating to Cherry unturned, and documents her sources in an unobtrusive but comprehensive set of notes after the text, leaving the powerful narrative flow of the main text uninterrupted.<br />It's a very exciting book; I would have offered 5 stars but the narrative does frankly slow down a lot after &quot;Worst Journey&quot; gets published; and in any case I think time might be equally well spent on Cherry's own book.	2003-06-06

So Christopher Buckley, former White House staffer, seems like a natural for a walking tour of Washington D.C.<br />It seems painfully obvious on reading the result, however, that Buckley is writing for hire.  There's nothing actually wrong with it; Buckley is his usual entertaining self.  BUT he doesn't have much original to say and he really seems to be padding to reach the book's finish at a scant 143 small pages of text.  You don't need him to tell you what there is to see in walking from the Capital to the Washington Monument, for example.  <br />Surely Buckley has some favorite neighborhoods or haunts that you can't get from Fodors or the like, but he is keeping them to himself.  The best parts are in Walk 3, when he talks about his days in the Old Executive Office Building, and takes a commercial walking tour of the old Lafayette Square neighborhood.  But I can't bring myself to give him credit for the Lafayette Square bits, as he is so clearly just repeating the stories of his tourguide.  <br />Go on THAT tour (the guide's name is Anthony Pitch) rather than fork over the big bucks for this little book.<br />P.S.  If you need an actual 'guide book' - addresses, phone, hours of operation, that sort of thing - this is DEFINITELY NOT for you; it's just not that kind of book.  In fact, since the book has no index, it's not even possible to look particular things up.	2003-06-05

As you might expect, it chronicles the hard times and triumphs of the first two generations of the musical Carter family, starting with A.P. and his then-wife Sara, and Sara's cousin and sister-in-law Maybelle, and continuing on through Maybelle's daughters (Helen, Anita, and June Carter Cash), in-laws (Johnny Cash) and even granddaughters.  The author(s) received the full cooperation of the surviving members of the family; the book has benefited tremendously, for example, from interviews with June Carter Cash and Johnny Cash.<br />Hirshberg and Zwonitzer's aim, however, goes beyond the tell-all.  They are trying to convey not just the fundamental integrity of the Carters and their music, but also the rise of country `hillbilly' music in the 20s and 30s and what it meant to the people that heard it.  As a result the reader leaves the book wanting to hear more of the music, which to my mind is a mighty fine result.	2003-05-27

I'd like to address this review to the many many readers who are looking for something really GREAT for younger readers.<br />Tiffany, a 9-year-old witch must save the world with the assistance of a herd of drunken angry red-headed six-inch-tall kilt-wearing Scottish fairies, who bear names like \\"Slightly Bigger Than Wee Jock But Not So Big as Middle-Sized Jock Jock\\" and \\"Rob Anybody.\\"<br />The book is hysterically, laugh-out-loud funny for both younger and adult readers (my family looked at me funny as I was giggling the whole time I was reading it.)  Although a girl is the hero, the rambunctious troublemaking Feegles will make the book highly appealing for boys (of all ages) as well.<br />It's actually serious in intent, though, with themes reminiscent of A Wrinkle in Time or The Lion Witch and the Wardrobe series (the villain is a Queen who distorts people's consciousnesses and leaves a trail of frozen weather everywhere she goes).  Tiffany saves the world through strength of character and common sense (and hooray for those!) rather than with magic alone.<br />As much as we liked Harry Potter around our house, I think that Wee Free Men is the equal of any of the Potter books.  The best \\"kid\\" fiction of the year (or longer).	2003-05-14

If you are a fan of the previous two books in this series, you'll definitely want to give it a try.  This time child criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl's master creation - a tiny computer based on the fairy technology he stole in the last book - is hijacked by a Chicago mobster, Jon Spiro.  Artemis teams up with the fairies to get it back.<br />Because \\"Eternity Code\\" revolves around Artemis vs. evil human adults more than Artemis vs. fairies, we lose some of the entertaining and creative descriptions of the Fairies' underground universe. The only fairy creatures who play much of a part in the action are Holly Short and Mulch Diggums.  What's more, the human-vs-human violence is really R-rated:  loyal bodyguard Butler gets a mortal gunshot wound to the chest in the first chapter (how will he survive?), and Spiro's henchman are constantly choking and destroying (or attempting to destroy) other characters.<br />It's an extremely well-plotted book.  You won't be able to put it down.  Still, as a reader and as a parent, I would have preferred more of the fairies and less of the mobsters.	2003-05-08

Top 100 Non-Fiction Books of the Century list.  In \\"Good-bye to All That, \\" the British poet Robert Graves (1895-1985), best known to American readers as the author of the novel of ancient Rome, \\"I Claudius,\\"  writes the autobiography of his youth, justifiably famous for its eloquent but straight-forward depiction of the horrors of WWI, during which Graves spent years in the trenches of France as an army captain.<br />More than the war, however, Graves' topic is the passing of an era:  the class-ridden and naïve culture of the Edwardian upper classes, a culture did not survive the war.  Graves came from a landed family and received a classic boarding-school education.  Even in the trenches officers like Graves had personal servants and took offense when they had to dine with officers of `the wrong sort' (promoted from the lower classes). <br />Graves' narrative itself barely survives the end of the war; the post-war chapters seem listless and shell-shocked, emotionally detached.  The battles he survived are written about with precision, gravity, and emotional impact; but Graves' marriage and the birth of his children seem like newspaper reports.  Surprisingly, he doesn't even talk of his poetry much.  This, surely, is not a defect of the book but a genuine reflection of his feelings at the time:  After the War, nothing meant much to him.<br />Graves' literary style is very matter-of-fact--the opposite of the imagistic, adjective-driven language one might expect of a poet.  Instead, he had a gift for the right details: in only a sentence or two, by careful description, he can perfectly describe a fellow-soldier or give the exact sense of `being there' in battle.  The book is a remarkable achievement worth reading even for those who may be glad the old days were left behind.	2003-05-06

I thoroughly enjoyed this historical/literary novel wrapped around a set of gruesome, almost Hannibal-Lecter-like murders (a similar amount of gore but without the cannibalism!).  Pearl does a wonderful job bringing both the historical characters and Boston itself to life.  Their love for Dante will rub off on you.      I even believed Pearl when this literary Fantastic Five were rummaging around crypts and the like solving the crime.  So it was a bit of a disappointment when the criminal did not, in the end, seem to be as thoughtful, well-drawn, or frankly as interesting as his pursuers.

Eck's framework for the book cites four sources of great design:  siting the house on the property, floor plans, exterior (elevation) and final details.  This makes the book more balanced than those that just focus on, say, the floor plan and finish.      I found his discussion of the 'massing' of the house to be fascinating.  It went a long way towards explaining why the too-large floor plans of the usual suburban house today--although in many cases just traditional layouts blown up by 50%--just don't look quite right.    That said, the book is predominantly oriented towards relatively empty-nester second homes in relatively rural locations.  With some pleasant exceptions, these are not houses for people who have to, say , wonder where to store the dirty soccer equipment or the snow blower, or where their kid's model collection is going to go.    They ARE beautiful, though - I swear that some day I'm going live on p.107!!	2003-04-22

Cohen finds poetry rather than tragedy as her daughter and father cross paths: daughter Ava surging into consciousness, learning new words by the hour, father Sanford finally forgetting even his name.<br />I am overwhelmed by the truth of this poetry, because I am in a similar situation: my father-in-law was diagnosed with dementia a few months after my daughter's birth.  As Dad has declined, my daughter has thrived.  It is undeniably sad. Yet they are central to  each other's worlds; even on days when Dad seems to know no one, you can tell he remembers G.  You can tell she loves him and he loves her even though they can't speak.  <br />A greater theme in Cohen's book is the power of community; her neighbors help her bear her burdens (chopping firewood, shoveling her driveway, watching Ava), just as she helps her father bear his.  Thus, even if you are not directly touched by Alzheimer's or the like, this well-written and touching book is likely to resonate with you too.<br />May the world still be this way when we are older.	2003-04-15

Fans of straightforward story-writing might be frustrated by Michael Cunningham's book, which swirls back and forth between modern New York, 1950's California, and late Edwardian England like a whirlpool.   But its emotional effect is powerful and it is worth an effort.<br />I found it had a profound impact on me once I started reading it as though I were listening to a piece of music.  Themes rise to the surface, submerge, and reappear (purchasing flowers; a kiss shared between two women; a life-threatening illness; an interrupted attempt to run away from one's life; a suicide reconsidered)-just as in music.  Let it wash over you rather than analyze it, and you will be well rewarded.	2003-04-15

This particular book is set in Venice, which is really brought to life (I got rather excited when the body of a victim was found in a canal that was down the street from a hotel where I once stayed.)<br />This is my first of Pear's 'art history mysteries,' however, and the characters and the plot have yet to grow on me.  Flavia diStefano, an Italian detective, is energetically drawn, but Jonathan Argyll, the art expert who tags along with her, is an enigma.  Perhaps he is more colorful in other stories in this series.  The plot is pretty tortured and difficult to retain if you are not an art history export.   There is rather a lot of detail conveyed third-hand (scenes in which two characters sit in a cafe talking about what a third character said to a fourth character).<br />Nevertheless, every time I want a 'hit' of Italy, I'm likely to go back to this series for a quick fix!	2003-04-11

Farrell or The Siege of Krishnapur until one day I was scanning a list of winner of England's Booker Prize and I noticed that Siege was out-of-print in America.  I was so intrigued I sent off to England for it, but it is now also available in the U.S.<br />The novel narrates the story of the British community at Krishnapur during the Indian Mutiny of 1857, when the entire community holed up in the Residency (like a governor's palace) for months under siege.  Farrell's style is highly cinematic, reminiscent of great movie epics about that era, such as \\"The Man Who Would Be King,\\" - lots of scope, majesty, explosions, and bright-red uniforms, added to the day-to-day domestic squabbles of the community.  Farrell's take is not a shallow war novel though; he is witty, ironic, inspired, and sad in turn.  <br />The book features remarkable turns of fortune and engaging details on every page, all of which were dramatically motivated and apt. (Examples: When the besieged run out of ammunition, they create canister shot by stuffing ladies' stockings with silverware.  There's a sudden infestation of flying bugs that will make you jump right out of your chair. Two doctors have an argument about the cause of cholera with dramatic consequences.  A lucky shot by a Lieutenant....well I won't spoil it for you.)<br />The main character, the Collector, seems to stand in for all of Britain as he is transformed by his Indian experience: first arrogance and a passion for bringing British `civilization' to the uncivilized, then bravado as he stands up to the initial assaults, then despair as he watches the failure of mere ingenuity to overcome the natives.  In a  wonderful little coda at the end of the book you can see how he has been utterly transformed by the experience.<br />A wonderful find, a 'must read'! I'm off to read the rest of Farrell's novels!	2003-02-20

He is comprehensive in the extreme, but his writing style is anecdotal and he does not go for any elaborate sociological explanation of why such performers exist or what they `mean' to society.  He just wants you to have fun, and perhaps to freak you out just a wee bit.<br />The book is also very nicely designed; its large wide pages lie flat and there are loads of remarkable illustrations. Definitely worth a look!	2003-02-07

He's a gifted writer and brings the intensity of the thoughts and feelings of the cleanup crew to full life. <br />The most stunning moments in the book, though, stem from his unique access to stories not I had not previously heard reported.  Like Frank Lombardi, the Transit Authority manager who was sitting at his desk on the 72nd floor of the North Tower when it was hit, helped show people to safety, and was *in* the WTC 3 building (the Marriott Hotel), when the South Tower collapsed overhead.  Or the story of Genelle Guzman, who dropped 30 stories as the building collapsed, but survived, one of only two civilians to be pulled alive from the rubble.  After 27 hours trapped with her legs crushed and pinned under rubble, she was rescued when she heard a search party, calling \\"do you see the light?\\"<br />In the end Langewiesche's wandering narrative left me unsure of what his `theme' was - what I was supposed to feel.  Maybe that's not a bad thing.  Maybe it's just the way it was.  <br />Maybe we will never know how we are supposed to feel about this one.	2003-01-29

She is clever with descriptions that make sly reference to the family restaurant business (\\"our hallway was the color of ballpark mustard...\\"). I especially liked her stories about her rivalry with and love for her sister; even as adults Volk flew across country just to feed her sister after an operation (and then squabbled, of course, like sisters do!)<br />However, it is not an industry expose, as some readers might have hoped.  It is a family history first and a `restaurant' book only secondarily.<br />The only thing that kept me from giving this book my total endorsement (and thus five stars rather than four) is that this seems to be a facelift-and-fur-coat sort of family, which mine is definitely not.  Thus there was a limit to how much I could identify with them.  If this would not happen to you, you should consider it a five-star book.	2003-01-29

If you are an old-house fan, this book is the equivalent of a college education.  Here are some reasons this book is both entertaining and useful: <br />It starts with chapters on basic structure: shapes of houses, style of construction, ornamentation, etc.  There are simple, remarkably clear drawings accompanying all this that will serve to give you a kind of 'vocabulary' to interpret houses when you run across something new (for example, a dozen different types of dormers - what are they all called?).  (These involve almost entirely external elements, for detailed interiors you will need another book.)<br />Lots of delicious historical background about how history and technological advances changed housing.  For example, the authors divide folk housing into &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;post-railroad&quot; because not until railroads made building materials nationally accessible did a national set of housing styles develop.<br />Following this, there are a series of chapters describing different styles (i.e., Victorian, Tudor, etc.), starting with the characteristic details, when and where the style is found, etc. The McAlisters do a particularly good job on regional variations; there are some remarkable maps showing the prevelance of different styles in different states.<br />The graphics are fantastic and plentiful.  The simple stylzed drawings of building elements (rooflines, doorways, windows, etc.) clearly distinguish one detail from another, while the photographs make you want to pop into the car and drive all over to see the real houses themselves.<br />One note:  there is a table, starting around p. 55, that will make the book much easier to use as a 'field guide' (i.e., driving around looking at houses the way birders look at birds).  This chart helps you use key identifying features to determine the most likely style of the house.  For example, my house has a steeply pitched roof and multliple gables, so it's probably a Tudor.  From there you can go to the proper chapter.  Without this chart you'll have to search the whole book.	2003-01-03

Nobody could decipher it; in fact, they couldn't even agree on what language the script represented.  Andrew Robinson tells the fascinating story of Michael Ventris, the architect/amateur linguist who 'cracked' the code of Linear B and proved to the world that it contained an ancient form of Greek.<br />The story unfolds with the same drama as a murder mystery or detective story.  Robinson makes what could have been a complicated story eloquent and clear.<br />Although I recommend this book highly, at the end of it I still felt in the dark about Ventris himself.  He seems to have been a great eccentric and very private individual.  His sudden death at the age of 34 seems to have occurred under a cloud of deep depression that Robinson does not really explain.  Linear B may be deciphered, but Ventris is still a mystery.	2002-12-31

WHEN do you stop beating the batter?  WHY do you roast at low temperatures for a long time, rather than at high?<br />In other words, &quot;The Best Recipe&quot; is actually a fascinating and informative set of lessons on critical cooking skills and techniques, not just a list of ingredients.  Oh yes, the recipes themselves are top-notch and delicious, but even more enlightening are the stories that precede each recipe about how each recipe was tested and derived.  Why it makes a difference to add a teaspoon of water when you want your cookies extra-big but still chewy, for example.  <br />In case I've made it sound like a college textbook, I'll add that it is truly a FUN read.  I am envious of the authors - what a great time they must have had, learning the way to do things right!<br />There are hundreds of recipes here, in every category.  This is going up into my pantheon next to Joy of Cooking.  The recipes cover much of the same ground but The Best Recipes tops even my beloved Joy in helping me know what to do next.	2002-12-30

Its style shows its age:  reading this book is like listening to an old 1920's newspaper reporter from the far end of the bar after he's had too many drinks: lots of exotic tall tales of life in the gritty city; countless names and places rise and disappear never to be heard again.  The overall effect is entertaining but completely unbelievable, as though Paul Bunyon had moved to the Lower East Side of 19th-century Manhattan.<br />One illustration will suffice: the early gangster &quot;Mighty Mose&quot; is describe as 'at least 8 feet tall' wearing boots studded with inch-long spikes.On one occasion Asbury has Mose pulling an oak tree out of the ground by its roots to 'smite' some of a rival gang, the Dead Rabbits.  On another the author claims Mose swam underwater from Manhattan to Staten Island without coming up for air.  It comes off as the kind of book a boy would have hidden in a corncrib to read when it was first published in 1927: lowlife fun, but if you're looking for the real history, you will be disappointed.<br />You will be even FURTHER disappointed if you expect the book to resemble the new Scorcese movie in any manner.  Although Scorcese borrows the names of characters from the book - Bill the Butcher, Jack Scirocco, Vallon, Everdeane - and sets the movie around the time of the 1863 Draft Riots, which really occured - in the book these characters are sometimes separated by 50 years and 100 pages.  The character played by Leonardo diCaprio, Amsterdam Vallon, does not appear at all in the book.  <br />I first read the book before the movie was filmed, because of my interest in New York history.  It's entertaining although the writing style is pretty archaic.  But if you came to this page looking for the 'true story' behind the movie, you won't find it here.	2002-12-18

In the 2nd novel of his series on Precious Ramotswe, the only lady detective in Botswana, Alexander McCall Smith continues to turn the detective genre inside out with some of the best writing you'll see in any genre.  Precious is African, female, of &quot;traditional build,&quot; open-hearted, optimistic, and wise, in opposition to the classic hard-boiled cynical American wiseguy.<br />&quot;Tears of the Giraffe&quot; develops the metaphor of a detective as a kind of mother who, by observing the people around her carefully, is at the same time taking care of them. The maternal theme is explicit in this story: the primary mystery involves an American mother looking for a long-lost son.  At the same time Precious must cope with the sudden adoption of two winsome orphans by her fiancee, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.  Watching out for people, watching out for Africa itself, is a way of respecting it.<br />The style of the book mirrors Precious herself: simple, too-the-point, a fine sense of humor, and very observant.  There are some really eloquent even lyrical passages as Precious drives across her belowed Botswana. <br />I again caution that readers with a taste for complex who-dun-it thickly plotted detective novels will find this VERY different.  And if you are new to the Ramotswe series, start with the first book (The Number One Ladies' Detective Agency), which will give you important details of Precious' and Matekoni's history.<br />But please read it eventually - you will find no better-written book this year.	2002-12-12

I like my Victorian novels epic and sooty, for example.  \\"Carter Beats the Devil\\", based (VERY loosely) on the actual life and career of Charles Carter (NOT Houdini, as implied by some other reviewers), a turn-of-the century magician, perfectly brings to life the 1920s era. <br />The elaborate, tricky, and slightly melodramatic plot leaves me wondering 'what next' like an old \\"Perils of Pauline\\" silent film (the ones with the dame tied to the railroad tracks).  It has the slightly slapstick quality of those movies, too.  Even the modest romantic interludes have a 20s sincerity to them.  It's as thrilling as a summer blockbuster movie, circa 1927.  <br />Since the book had a reputation as a 'literary' novel, I was surprised how well it worked as sheer entertainment.  This doesn't mean it lacks depth, though.  Carter (the magician character) is not what you think he is, a mystery to be worked out.  The same is true of many of the characters. The author gets you to think about the meaning of deception and honesty, escape and confinement, even the price and value of freedom. <BR> <BR>It's even more interesting to read because Gold borrows techniques from magic itself to accomplish this; the author is quite adept at slight-of-hand and misdirection.  You will not soon guess how it ends!	2002-12-03

It is really invigorating to read the words of an author so completely in command of his material as McPherson.   He ties together the causes and consequences of the battle of Antietam with remarkable eloquence and a breathtaking efficiency (at less than 160 pages). He boils down the complex story to seamless narrative.<br />I worry about who's going to read this book, however.  War buffs already know everything that's in it, and are likely to be disappointed by the small space the actual narration of the battle takes (only about 20 pages of the book).  Newcomers might be better off with McPherson's one-volume treatment of the whole war (\\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\").  If you are wondering where you fall on this line, here's a good test question:  do you know the story about how battle plans came to be wrapped around some cigars?  If you haven't (sounds interesting, doesn't it?), there's enough new in this book for you.  If you have....well, you might find much of the content familiar, but please have a go anyway.

Moving back in time leaves Ankh-Morpork free of many (but not all) Watch favorite characters (the book is quite Carrotless, troll, dwarf, and almost zombie-free).  This reduces the slapstick and rat-pie quotient significantly but if you prefer Vimes' hardboiled cop to those hijinks, you will like this a lot.  It's quite thrilling, actually, and a lot of fun seeing many of the Watch series' human characters in younger form.	2002-11-25

The message is one of joy and sharing, even between little mouse and Big Hungry Bear.<br />If you are also a fan of the Woods' book, \\"The Little Mouse, the Big Hungry Bear, and the Red Ripe Strawberry\\" you will again be charmed by the Woods' animated and detailed drawings and happy-ending story in this sequel.   <br />The little mouse lives in a mousehole furnished down to the last detail: there's a Christmas tree, loaves of bred in the kitchen, and a big stack of tacks by the door in case the Big Hungry Bear comes to steal the mouse's Christmas presents.  But the mouse has a change of heart when he realizes the Big Hungry Bear never gets any presents of his own.<br />There's JUST the right amount of text per page to keep the story flowing, there's JUST the right blend of detail, sweetness, and humor in the drawings, there's JUST the right amount of excitement for, say, a 2 to 4 year old (it's not quite scary because the bear is never depicted, and actually proves to be a good and generous friend to the mouse).  <br />For fans of the \\"Strawberry\\" book, note the strawberry-shaped bookends over the mouse's bed on the last page of the book.  It's that kind of thoughtful touch that makes the Woods' books so great.	2002-11-20

Ancient Romans also trod the paths to Naples, to Athens, Olympus, Turkey, Alexandria, Luxor, etc. They even left graffiti! Perrotet's book reports a trip taken by the author and his pregnant girlfriend (Les) on a modern reenactment of the trips taken by the cultured classes of the ancient world.<br />Most travelogues rise and fall on the personality (or lack thereof) of their authors. If you like the writer, you'll like his/her observations about travel. Tony Perrottet is quite charming, in an Aussie-game-for-anything-and-looking-for-a-bit-of-trouble kind of way, but he's also erudite and witty, so the book wins points from me not only because I enjoyed 'spending time' with the author but because I learned a lot of new things.<br />Perrotet reports from ancient sources on how the Romans traveled, where they went, what they complained about and praised, even what tschotckes and souveniers they liked to buy. I learned, for example, that 70% of the personal letters known from the ancient world were in a single stash of papyri found in Egypt only about a century ago. I learned of statues that bear graffiti from the last century as well as from 2000 years ago.<br />Perrotet weaves these little gems seamlessly into the modern narrative of the himself and Les gamely braving bad plumbing, incoherent signs, stomach flu, etc. in order to find the wonders of the ancient world. Perrottet even goes scuba diving off the coast of Naples to investigate a city that fell into the sea eons ago, which he finds among the candy wrappers and less savory leavings of modern times.<br />There's something perfectly right about him doing this in anticipation of the arrival of his first child, although I did feel pretty sorry for poor Les, who spent the better part of her 2nd trimester holed up in strange hotel rooms with the flu and the particularly bizarre selection of old American films shown on Mediterranean TV. But everyone made it home just fine, and Perrottet leaves you with lots of wonderful memories of his trip...and even of the trips of Antony, Cleopatra, Hadrian, and the like. <br />It's a thoroughly enjoyable book, perfect for traveller-lovers and history-lovers alike.	2002-11-16

Precious is a portly-but-dignified, 38-year-old lady living in Botswana with absolutely no detective experience, who takes it into her head to found a detective agency when her father dies and leaves her a little money.<br />Preciouse Ramotswe turns the whole idea of being a detective inside out.  Although she does solve cases, they don't seem to be the point of the tale but secondary to Precious herself.  And I must say I found her completely compelling.  Completely centered and self-assured without being cocky.  Size 22 without self-loathing (and with multiple marriage proposals).  A great sense of humor and clever without being cynical.  <br />It's as though being a detective was a metaphor for taking care of people.  Detecting = observing the world around.  Observing the world = taking care of the people in it.  Detective as mother.<br />Although in parts it is quite funny (the bit where the snake gets snuck under her car), on the whole I found it supremely moving.  Alexander McCall Smith mixes Precious' resolution of her cases with lyrical passages describing the Botswana countryside that Preciouse observes as she passes through it in her trusty white van.<br />My only caution is that readers with a taste for complex who-dun-it thickly plotted detective novels will find this VERY different.  But anyone else reading this review--anyone that just appreciates wonderful writing--should PLEASE buy this book.	2002-11-03

Dan Sickles, a Civil War-era New York politician, became notorious for shooting down the lover of his teenage wife in cold blood...and getting away with it (claiming it was justifiable).  As a Union general, Sickles is famous for what is regarded by many as one of the most outrageous tactical errors of the Civil War: the advance down from Cemetary Ridge on the 2nd day of Gettysburg.  Thomas Keneally's book is a lengthy--but not very invigorating or  enlightening--biography of Sickles.  <br />The story of Dan Sickles is a puzzle to many Civil War buffs, but this book does not shed much light on the mystery of why a fellow who by all accounts was a murderer, a highly corrupt politician, an incompetent general, and in the whole a sociopath, rose to such positions of responsibility.  <br />So I read this book hoping to learn \\"how did such a maniac rise to so many positions of responsibility and power?  Was he especially charming?  intelligent?  handsome? sneaky?\\"  Although Thomas Keneally describes Sickles crises (especially his murder trial) in painful and fairly tedious detail, I never found my answer.  Sickles appears to have had no redeeming features whatsoever.<br />Perhaps we should not judge Keneally too harshly for being unable to find the good sides to a sociopath.  But perhaps we needn't read the book about him, either.	2002-10-24

The episodic nature strains credulity a bit but not to the breaking point:  how is it possible that Sugar is murderous and low-class in Part I; obsessive and affectionate in Part II, and yet passing as the governess of a high-bred young lady in Part III?<br />Although it's something like 800 pages it's a fast read with no dull passages.  I enjoyed it a great deal.  But for it to merit the remarkable rave review the book got in the NYTimes, I would want more.  I don't think I'll remember much about it next month.  For a book to be 'great' I'd want it to have more impact than that.<br />P.S.: If you like your characters 'likeable,' your plot-endings tidy, and your sex tantalizing (rather than gritty and smelly), this may not be the book for you.  Personally I did not mind these features but a reader of the more romantic type of historical fiction might be put off.	2002-10-14

I was so put off by that attitude that I avoided picking up a copy in hardback.  <br />So I confess to reading the paperback with a chip on my shoulder about the author's attitude.  And frankly Franzen is uncharitable to his characters; he doesn't seem to like anyone in his own book.  Throughout most of the book he's particularly disdainful of the elderly Midwestern parents, missing few opportunities to look down his authorial nose at the mother's knick-knacks, choice of furniture, obsession with the family Christmas, etc.  The druggish ex-prof son Chip, fired for sleeping with a student, is written more sympathetically than his mom.<br />Then I realized I was being upset with Franzen for being mean to FICTIONAL CHARACTERS.  In other words, he had written these oddball people so clearly and precisely that I was as mad at him as if he had condescended to real people.  So on that level I'd have to say he's an excellent writer, and recommend his ability to bring characters to life as an outstanding feature of the book.  <br />Other pluses:  He's funny, if sometimes mean.  More importantly, this is the most realistic depiction of the tragedies of Alzheimers (which afflicts the father character) that I have every read.  Since this is a problem that has touched my family's life I was appreciative of Franzen's abilities.  This feature of the book is actually quite touching.<br />Overall I'd say, Franzen's a good writer and deserves your time.	2002-10-11

We took our 8-year-old son to Rome for 4 days this summer.  In that short space we crammed a LOT of things that are in all the guidebooks - the Vatican, the Colisseum and Forum, the Pantheon, etc.  <br />\\"Around Rome with Kids\\" added SEVERAL kid-friendly sites that we never saw in any other guidebook, including Fodor's big ones.  For example:<br />1) The Archaebus  - takes a tour to a park on the outskirts of the city where there are many ruins of Roman acqueducts, and goes right down the oldest stones on the Appian Way--in air-conditioned comfort;<br />2) The \\"Plastico di Roma\\" - enormous scale model of Ancient Rome in the Musselini (sp?) era Museo di Civilta Romana out in the EUR district<br />3) The Time Elevator - expensive but fun simulator ride near the Piazza Venezia.  Cheesy but a good antidote to the seriousness of the ruins.<br />The best part, from the Mom perspective, is that in addition to hours, prices, and directions to each site, the authors point out kid-friendly restaurants and pit stops nearby.

The Pirate Hunter chronicles the history of Captain William Kidd, a &quot;privateer&quot; from New York who  received a questionable commission from England to police the high seas for pirates.  <br />Zacks documents in glorious detail Kidd's 2-year voyage resulting in the capture of 2 ships that were--in theory--French and thus subject to capture as spoils of war.  Authorities later claimed Kidd was a REAL pirate rather than a pirate-hunter.  Zacks builds a convincing case that Kidd was justified by 17-century standards in taking the ships and thus was undeserving of his sad fate.<br />Although I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, Zack's instinct for the entertaining detail could have been balanced against the length of the book, which is about 400 pages.  350 would have been enough for me, especially when Zacks digresses to tell the story of rival pirate Robert Culliford temporarily dropping the Kidd narrative.<br />Also, to my warped 21st-century mind, the distinction between a privateer (essentially a pirate with a government license to take goods from merchants luckless enough to be flying under an enemy flag) and a private is a pretty small one.  To accept Kidd as innocent of piracy you would have to believe him incredibly naive.  <br />Nevertheless, I think your interest in William Kidd will outlast this book- it's a fascinating part of history  and Zacks has a good time with it.	2002-09-30

Practical and inspirational!	This is a truly remarkable book, extremely well-organized, inspirational, and full of real practical advice.  Wiseman first details the different social roles girls play in adolescent 'societey' - what she calls \\"Girl World\\" - such as the Queen Bee, the Banker, the Target.  Then she describes the different kind of social dilemmas these roles can cause.  But - most importantly -she tells readers (presumably parents) WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.<br />This is not just proscriptive advice, although there is a lot of that too (e.g., \\"how to tell if she's had a party while you were away\\").  One thing that really impressed me about Wiseman's approach is that she gives parents an entire way of approaching problems that they can share with their daughters.  <br />In other words, she doesn't tell you what your rules should be (she leaves that to YOU, thank goodness), but she does tell you how to get your daughter to think about why you as a parent have created them and your family's values should mean to her.<br />A second thing that really impressed me about this book is that it is wholly non-judgmental: it does not divide girls into Good and Bad/Mean.  If your daughter is a Queen Bee, Wiseman knows she has problems too, and she helps you figure out how to solve them.<br />For more conservative parents, it's worth mentioning that this non-judgmental approach extends to issues of sexual orientation, including homophobia and same-sex attraction.  Other reviewers have been rather upset by this, but keep the problem in perspective: out of 288 pages, I counted 4-5 that discussed homophobia in boys and another 4-5 around issues of same-sex attraction.  That doesn't seem out-of-proportion in a 200+ page book if something like 5-10% of our daughters are gay. Wiseman's opinion on the subject is clear, but fundamentally she is arguing in favor of parents' right --and NEED--to communicate their own family values to their daughters.  <br />My daughter is only 3, but I can already see the socialstructure that girls impose on each other -- when she comes home saying \\"So-and-so says she is not my friend anymore.\\"  I am very grateful to Wiseman for giving me a headstart toward providing her with a healthy adolescence.	2002-09-30

It's perfect - she really enjoys it but she is always happy to come home at the end of the day.  \\"My Somebody Special\\" features happy daycare \\"kids\\" (actually animals - a fox, a kitten, a hedgehog, a puppy, etc.) who are still excited to see that it is THEIR mom or dad coming through the door at the end of the day.<br />On one page, a \\"parent\\" comes through the door - the fox-mama for example, and the text asks a teasing question about which 'kid' she/he is looking for (\\"Whose belly is soft and pink as a rose?\\" for the hedgehog.)  The next page reveals the answer as the parent snatches up her loved one with a big hug.  <br />My daughter enjoys matching up the parents and kids on each page; the rhymed text is easy for her to remember and the pictures are really sweet.  <br />But I confess to liking it at least as much as she does.  I guess I identify with the fox-mama:  I enjoy walking in the door in the evening and spotting my Special Someone at least as much as she enjoys being spotted!<br />A must for all kids in preschool and especially for all working parents.	2002-09-25

Ambrose Bierce was a Civil War veteran who seems almost to have tried to exorcise the horrors of the war he lived by writing about it.  The result is gripping and utterly believable; the style is immediate, you-are-there, not-one-word-too-many.  Not the flowery elaborate style you might have associated with Victorian prose.<br />The results convey the horrors of war as well as anything written in your lifetime.  The story about the little boy who gets lost near his home when it is surrounded by a battle...I don't think I'll ever forget it.  I won't spoil if for you but you've got to read it.  If you think that 130+-year-old stories have nothing to say to you, give these a try, you will see otherwise.<br />Not to mention the Dover version is NOT EVEN TWO DOLLARS at the time of this writing.  You spent more than the price of this book on your coffee this morning, I'll bet.  What have you got to lose?  Add it to a Supersaver order, there won't even be a shipping charge.

What does it mean to be American?  How did the Civil War define us?  Why does it still seem to define us, especially in the South?  I opened Horwitz's book expecting to be entertained by stories of eccentric hardcore re-enactors, the type of guys that live all weekend on hardtack and salt pork and then go back to their jobs as dentists and systems analysts.<br />But this is not \\"just\\" a Civil War book.  Tony Horwitz develops an interest in Civil War re-enactors when they show up in his back yard one morning.  He follows them around on their weekend attempts to recreate the war. Through them, he discovers the continued obsession Americans have with the War itself.  <br />At first I was interested in this book because I am a history buff and a fan of re-enactments, but Horwitz has his sights set on a bigger topic than \\"just\\" hardcore re-enactors.  He is investigating the role the War plays in our national Identity.  It is the thing without which we would not be Americans at all.<br />This is a book with a wonderful afterglow:  it is an entertaining, fast read, highly  enjoyable...but months after I first read it the questions I posed earlier were still running through my head, and I had to read it again.  <br />Amazon editors listed this as one of the best non-fiction books of the 1990s, and after a 2nd read, I still agree with them.	2002-09-22

My inherent interest level in dragons and trolls is not that high.

I read this book a long time ago after suffering a great loss of my own, but rather than making me sadder strangely it made me feel better.  Banks communicates the terrible loneliness and isolation that surrounds and overwhelms the parents, the surviving victim, and even an attorney who is planning to sue for damages (who has himself lost a daughter to drugs).  <br />Banks' chacters have feelings that are genuine and human rather than stereotypically \\"bad\\" or \\"good.\\" Because the characters are flawed and struggling with those faults, it avoids sentimentality.  I identified with many of them.  <br />If you have avoided this book because of its tragic story, I urge you, \\"Don't\\".  I can think of no other author who can convey the emotions of ordinary people as well as Banks.  <br />I would not have believed it, but it made me feel better.	2002-09-15

I enjoyed this book very much; surely it will be one of the best if not the best and/or most popular kids' book published this year.  It is a fast, gripping read, with entertaining characters, and Venice as its backdrop - surely the finest city in the world for a work of magic and imagination.<br />It does come off as a bit of a collage built from other books - orphans Propser and Bo escape from an evil aunt and uncle (like Harry Potter), encounter a child-criminal mastermind (like Artemis Fowl), join a gang of kid thieves (like Oliver Twist) and tackle a historical mystery (like the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler).  The characters are not quite as well developed as in these books, and it's less fantastical than Harry or Artemis (with one major exception that I will not spoil for you).  <br />If you are a cynic you might think the author wrote it all with an eye to the main chance (selling the movie rights), in part because she dedicates the book to Bob Hoskins (presumably the actor) declaring that the character Victor looks just like him.<br />But if you're not so cynical you will really enjoy it - the author makes marvelous use of the city of Venice, it's funny and surprising and exciting.  It seem like a screenplay pretending to a book, but it's really going to make a great movie.	2002-09-08

Frequently this thesis was buried underneath another of Pollan's interesting ideas (for example the futility of man's manipulation of the natural environment, or what makes the apple peculiarly &quot;American&quot;). <br />But to be honest I did not mind.  Pollan is a completely entertaining writer.  He is equal parts funny, insightful, poetic, and informative.  For example, I loved his extended metaphor of the variability of nature as a library.  Each apple tree looks about the same, but inside they are quite different.  The value of the library lies in these differences.<br />The reasons I gave this book a &quot;4&quot; rather than a &quot;5&quot; may be minor from your perspective, depending on your own reading habits:  The Tulip essay was well done but not news if you have read other books or articles on Holland's tulip mania.  The Marijuana essay seemed to me a bit, um, disjointed and paranoid (hmmmm...wonder why?) although still entertaining.  You may have already read the Apple essay in Harpers and/or the potato essay in the NYT Sunday Magazine.  If you have not, however, they are both must reads (you will never eat a non-organic potato again when Pollan gets done with you).<br />Pollan's book itself illustrates the generative power of variability - he floats from idea to idea like a bee, and something new is created as a result.	2002-09-03

This could easily have gotten maudlin:  a late-30s single San Francisco mom rents her downstairs apartment to a monk who, due to spiritual distress, has just left the monastery.  They fall in love.  He's a good kisser.  He's nice to her kid.  He supports her through the illness of her mother.  They stay in love. The end.<br />But it is so wonderfully written - so funny (you will laugh!) and warm - and the author gives such a rich inner life to the characters - that the book transcends its plot.  The most remarkable, wonderful feature of Farrington's writing is that every character is complex and multi-dimensional.  Mike, the ex-monk, is not just some boilerplate Nice Guy.  His internal struggles with living in the \\"real world\\" seem completely believable and sympathetic.  Rebecca, the mom, is funny and smart, but also quirky.  Even characters who occupy no more than a page or two - the judge at a trial, or the receptionist at the  graphics firm where Rebecca works, or an eccentric friend of Rebecca's mom - they are all fully developed, interesting, distinct people.<br />How does the author do this?  I have never seen such a remarkable ability to put a flesh-and-blood character into just a few lines of text.<br />And funny, did I mention it was funny?  Funny and spiritual at the same time...you can't beat that.  I really hope everyone gets a chance to read it.	2002-08-17

Then, the hero Ned Maddstone is betrayed (a la the Count of Monte Cristo), spends 20 years unjustly locked in a mental institution, and returns to seek his revenge.  I've noticed that previous reviewers who liked the Flippant Frye were disturbed by the Spooky, Scary Frye who replaces him in mid-book.<br />Let me give you another perspective:  I think this was a change for the better.  The young, flippant, self-centered, class-bound comic characters of the introduction made my poor Midwestern soul want to slap them silly.  I can only take so much petulance.  Over the course of the book, through the darker events, the charcters manage to grow and change.  They are no longer twits.  In their place, there is sharp writing, deft plotting (it may be Dumas' plotting, but it is still deft), and much excitement.  <br />In short, this book managed to surprise me even though I knew the plot outline in advance--and how often can you say that anymore?<br />A final caveat - the violence is quite graphic, even sadistic (although believable in its way).  Stay away if you don't like that sort of thing, and pray that Mr. Frye has a really good therapist.	2002-08-14

It was a great, easy-to-read introduction to Cicero and his times.  It reads like a modern biography (chronologically, from birth to death) rather than an explanation of his written works and philosophy.  If you don't know the era or the man, this is a wonderful place to start.<br />I was, however, left a wee bit disappointed on two fronts:  first, Everitt's balanced perspective brought the myth down to size, by showing that Cicero was capable of changing his political decisions when expedient, by showing his somewhat self-centered personality, and by demonstrating his philosophy was derivative rather than original.  In other words, the book implies he was a fine talker, but doesn't seem to have had many good qualities beyond that.  I think a book that spent more time on his writings themselves would draw a different conclusion (and I'm guessing that the Cicero enthusiasts reading this review would dislike a book that appeared to take this position).<br />Second, Everitt goes to great effort to put Cicero in  his historic context, spending a lot of time explaining what else was going on in the republic.  This is very useful for novices like me but if you are already familiar with Roman history it will not be new to you.  But again, it makes Cicero seem like just one of the players rather than a towering literary figure.<br />Overall, though, it was an extremely enjoyable book.  I recommend it!	2002-08-14

I heard it described as \\"Die Hard with Fairies\\" and that seems completely accurate to me: lots of explosions do not literature make.   It is not at all whimsical and sweet-hearted like Harry Potter, it is macho and tough, as if Bruce Willis were an elf. I had some qualms about having an 8-year-old spend 10 hours reading such stuff when I would never let him watch.   As for the dwarf with the eccentric defense system, I guess I will tolerate him as long as he doesn't show up at my house!<br />If you are a mom reading this review, you might as well let him/her read it, he will COMPLETELY pester you until you do.<br />cb	2002-08-14

She is very thoughtful about how improving the traffic flow and the sightlines from room to room (and from inside to outside) makes every square foot of space count.  I find her argument that it makes more ecological sense to put the money into details than into natural-resource-grubbing VOLUME very compelling.<br />So, for me, this book is like a box of my favorite mixed chocolates:  it's delectable to go through and savor.   The pictures are beautiful and detailed.  You will got lots of ideas for your own dream house.  <br />However, this book is really about NEW houses.  If you are looking for information about how to make your existing small house more livable *today* it will be of less use to you.  And her ideas are not cheap....but we can all dream, can't we?	2002-06-29

The material is uneven, &quot;spotty&quot;: some good, some indifferent.  It contains essays previously published in magazines like the New Yorker and Outside magazine.  In fact, if you've read either of those often you will be disappointed to find relatively few new material.<br />If not however, the anglers will like some pieces, the Ian Frazier fans will like others but tire of the fish stories.  The one that is most successful on both counts, in my opinion, is the one about the fellow who ran an angler's shop near Grand Central Station.  It is more a personality piece than a fishing piece but combines both of Frazier's great abilities (writing that is funny and generous in spirit, and...of course...fishing).	2002-06-26

Business schools have developed a love/hate relationship with this book because although it contains a lot of good, thoughtful information, some people use it for the wrong reasons.<br />Make a distinction between the RANKINGS and the extended essay-type descriptions contained on the top scools.  The RANKINGS tell you (possibly) two things:  they tell you (maybe, sometimes) about the quality of the results the graduates get, and they tell you....well they tell you whether you will get bragging rights to your friends.  In other words, the rankings have developed their own prestige which is SEPARATE from the issue of whether they have anything to do with quality.<br />So consider the rankings with caution...do you need the reassurance of a very high ranking....or do you really care about quality of program?  This book actually tells you a great deal about the quality of the program, including everything from details about the curriculum, what they are looking for in admissions, which teachers are held in highest esteem, and general comments from recent students.  THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NUMBER.  It's related to the number, but it's not the same thing.<br />Remember, however, not to stop with this book: the information given in any edition will start to get inaccurate before it hits the bookstore.  I can think of 5 or 6 top schools with new deans within the past year or two.   Perusing through the book I see a good number of &quot;top faculty&quot; that either have already gone on to another institution, or are non-tenured faculty on short-term contracts, who may be gone by the time you get there.  Even the curricula change pretty quickly.  Back up your reading of this book with school's web sites, visits, talks with alumns, etc.<br />After all, the question you really want the answer to is not &quot;do grads of School W make more money and have better careersthan graduates of School Y?&quot;, it's &quot;Will I MYSELF have a better career at School W than School Y.&quot;  Rather than worry about the ranking of the school you get into, find the school that works for YOU.  Finally, I see other reviewers saying &quot;this book got me into the BigBucks school.&quot;  I think that reviewer's intelligence, personality, and experience got him in.  If he hadn't gotten in to BigBucks, he would still be smart and hardworking, and the school that got him would have been lucky. And (for the record), the number at our school is just great!	2002-06-26

It's just the facts, mam.<br />The approach for European schools is the same, but I know of no other book that mentions more than even, say, half a dozen European schools.  This book has about 100 pages of info on British schools (which is almost as much as they have for the U.S.) and almost as much again for &quot;continental&quot; Europe.  So if you are interested in schools in Europe beyond the top six or so, you will actually need this book.  It will be handy (but incomplete, since it lacks much qualitative information).  <br />If you are a U.S. student (or intend to be), the basic Business Week guide gives the same basic information and adds a lot of qualitative info to.  Buy it instead for this country.	2002-06-26

I often read reviews crediting the writer's acceptance at a big-name school to a book.  Really, it is your own intelligence, abilities, and persistence that have the strongest impact on getting you in; what's in even the best book is mostly fine-tuning.  <br />This is not one of the best books, however.  This book will add nothing meaningful to the skills you already have.  There is very little in this book that you the applicant do not know instinctively.  The advice on how to beef up your resume, for example, is pretty standard stuff that you will find in any \\"get a job\\" book.  There is no school-specific content (i.e., what does Kellogg look for, vs. Wharton, vs. Chicago, etc.) to help you tailor your application to the particular hot-buttons of the school.<br />Furthermore, although copyright date on this book is 2000, it is based on an earlier edition and its age shows.  So it's really out of date.  For example, virtually no mention is made of the on-line application process.<br />There is more information about the application process--in Montauk's book \\"How to Get Into the Top MBA Programs.\\" Even better, application advice ALONG WITH information about specific schools--is plentiful in the Business Week \\"Guide to the Best Business Schools\\" book (make sure you get the most recent (7th) edition of that one).<br />Good luck!	2002-06-26

The story of Martin Clay's sudden obsession with his neighbor's possibly valuable painting is funny in the manner of Frayn's stage farces--wacky car chases, mistaken identities, lovers hidden in closets, etc.  <br />Interspersed with the farce are lengthy detailed passages in which Martin picks apart in detail the political environment of 16th-century Netherlands in hopes of identifying whether &quot;his&quot; painting is by the famed painter Bruegel.  I found this part quite interesting but disruptive in tone from the farce (16th-century Netherlands was apparently tragically oppressive, full of religious persecution, torture, etc.).  These passages are so long and involving that it becomes a bit hard to follow the farce that surrounds it.  <br />It would have worked better for me if I had bought into Martin Clay's motivation for doing what he does.  It's not clear why a philosophy professor (the main character) would suddenly develop either an art-history fixation or an interest in defrauding his neighbor of a valuable painting.<br />It's all quite entertaining but rather unbelievable. Overall I found the whole less than the sum of the parts.	2002-06-18

Even the story of the long walk back to freedom is tremendous...the rescuers loaning most of their clothing to the near-naked prisoners, carrying their buddies on their backs for miles, and the local natives turning out by the score with oxcarts to carry back prisoners to ill to walk.<br />Fair warning though--the story of the Bataan Death March and prison camp life that proceeded the rescue are bloody and a terrible indictment of what evil people may be capable of.  It is not for the faint of heart or stomach.<br />Remarkably, some of the key protagonists of the story are still alive.  This made me feel as though everyone should read this book soon, to emphasize that people still have the power to make history.	2002-06-10

The author's powers of description lead to a real sense of the people and place of the Plague Town.  The tragedy she writes about is very affecting.  For emotion, I would give it five stars.<br />But heavens it is melodramatic in the extreme.  People are either saintly or practically demonically evil.  True to melodramatic stereotype, the evil ones runs to either the Imperious Rich Baby-Killing Aristocrat, or the Dirt-Poor Drunken Abusive Lout. For variety, sometimes saintly people turn demonic--which is certainly a shock to the reader--but it doesn't seem possible for Brooks' characters to have more than one characteristic at a time.  In parts the writing is really over-the-top:... For the melodrama, I would reduce it to 3 stars.<br />So it evens out to 4 stars - meaning you'll enjoy it very much if you don't take it too seriously.  Read it on the beach.	2002-06-04

I am a big fan of the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian, but previously looked down my nose at Hornblower, I think because I knew it solely from TV and movies. This book never slows down for a minute--not just battles but ship repair and revictualling seem gripping in the hands of Forester.  <br />Based on the films, I was not expecting Hornblower to show much internal life--he always seems to be superhuman on screen, but in the book he must struggle with his softer nature to develop his imperious style.  Likewise I expected nothing interesting in the way of female characters, but it was a happy surprise to find Lady Barbara Wellesley on board ship.<br />If you will forgive a few O'Brian/Forrester comparisons:  O'Brian is funnier.  Forrester's battle scenes are a bit easier for me to follow.  Hornblower is a more interesting or at least complex character than Aubrey, but O'Brian has the advantage of Maturin, who not only adds character but allows for dialogue rather than the perennial internal monologues Hornblower has with himself because he has no one of rank to talk to.<br />I hope that more seasoned readers of the series will agree with this appeal to newer readers: Even if you have read neither author, this book is a good place to start.	2002-05-28

I have been looking for something for my students to read that gives them a real appreciation for the creative side of the business.  Jon Steel's book is so outstanding that I am considering making it required reading in my classes.<br />Three parts of his message are especially valuable to &quot;client side&quot; (i.e. marketing) people: first, he is very articulate about the importance of doing qualitative, consumer-centered research....but not over-interpreting it.  <br />Second, he makes a convincing argument for the use of judgment over data: clients sometimes imagine &quot;hard numbers&quot; will prove to them whether they are doing the right kind of advertising, but agency folks see this as a kind of cowardice.  Steel will help you understand the difference between useful, diagnostic, research that inspires great creative-- and research that results in boring, average advertising.<br />Finally, his chapter on creative briefs - what they are for and how to write them - is superb.  This is definitely going to be on the syllabus for next year.<br />Whether you are a client marketer, or an agency person who would like to inspire a client to more creative work, this is a must read.	2002-05-28

At the time I really enjoyed them; they were like chatty letters or phone calls from an old friend who had moved abroad.  They made me want to go see Paris again.<br />But put together in a single volume, Mr. Gopnik's essays come off as charming but very self-absorbed.   Mr. Gopnik sometimes takes it into his head to make pronouncements about the Nature of Writing or Culture-with-a-capital-C, which are pompous in the extreme.<br />So I'd summarize the book as entertaining but without anything new to say.  Read one essay, then put the book down for a while before you read the next...just like the magazine chitchat they were designed to be.	2002-05-17

For the rest, I would definitely recommend it. <br />1) This is a VERY funny book in some parts (there is a dog named \\"Sammy Davis Junior Junior\\" who is the seeing-eye dog for the hero's chauffeaur).  It is a moving and sad book in other parts, as the characters revisit Foer's grandfather's village after the Holocaust.  The tone changes from chapter to chapter like a roller coaster.  If you would be disturbed by a funny  chapter following a Holocaust chapter, you should avoid this book.<br />2) This is a very post-modern, self-referential, aren't-I-clever sort of book.  The two main characters, Jonathan (the author) and his translater Alex, send each other the chapters of the book each has written, make comments on the chapters they have been sent, and even make comments on the COMMENTS on the chapters.  This is the part that reminded me of Dave Eggers' \\"Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" but if you don't like that sort of thing, you should avoid this book.<br />Who should actually read this book:  Everyone else.  It really IS funny where it's funny, and tremendously sad where it's sad.  Foer really does have a wonderful imagination and a flair for language.   Although I found the navel-gazing comments-on-comments-on-comments a littly annoying, I have to admit that days after finishing it the images are still with me, making me think.  So many books are disposable today, so many books leave your brain the minute you set them down, this is not one of them.<br />So I forgive him for being too clever, and suggest that you do too.	2002-05-01

My students tell me it is getting harder and harder to get into the best programs.  That's especially true just now that the economy is bad - everyone decides to drop out of the economy for a couple of years, at the same time.  Our applications are up 40-50%.<br />So yes, you could use some advice, and some of Montauk's is OK.  But you should remember that NO book can change some basic facts about you: your GPA.  Your work experience.  Your basic intelligence.  If you do not score well on EVERY one of these, you will probably not end up in what the book calls a &quot;top&quot; program.  <br />Don't let that get you down - there are a lot of great programs out there.  Instead of obsessing about whether you will get into Wharton (or whatever), obsess about learning more about LOTS of program, to find the one where you will FIT the best.  This book does not really offer you any help in the way of describing the pluses and minuses of the various programs, so don't make this the first MBA admissions book you get.<br />That said, I found some useful pointers in this book, particularly when it comes to recommendations.  Pick your recommendation writers wisely (make sure they know how to write!), and PREP them.  Remind them what makes you special, send them a resume, etc.  I write a dozen or more letters a year.  The students who give me more information about themselves make it easy for me to help them stand out.  <br />Give yourself enough time to take the GMATs more than once in case you are not happy the first set of results.  <br />And (this one is mine, not Montauks) don't be in a hurry to do it this year if you don't have to.  If you will be able to tell a better story about your work experience 12 months from now, wait to apply.  Stronger work experience = stronger chance of getting in.<br />So to summarize - this book is OK but a book with detailed info about programs would be better.  Concentrate on finding the right program for you instead of getting up high in the Business Week rankings.  Pay attention to your recommendation letters.<br />Maybe you won't have to read the book now that you've read the review ;-).  <br />Good luck!	2002-04-21

The book has DK's typically graphic-intense design, with its maps augmented by timelines, photos, drawings, etc.  I notice one other reviewer did not like this feature but for us the added graphics made the history more understandable and enjoyable.<br />I would also call the book geographically comprehensive rather than &quot;politically correct.&quot; I don't notice any right-or-left political skew to the text, for example.  The book has even-handed coverage of all continents, so it is not for those looking PRIMARILY for European history (although this is reasonably well covered).  After all, you can get that sort of thing elsewhere.  Where the DK book is irreplacable is its coverage of Asia, Africa, etc. - things we wouldn't know about if we didn't have this book.	2002-04-18

Unfortunately it's pretty hard to visualize how the empire expanded and contracted, and how the various military campaigns came about, on the basis of text alone.  This book of maps is a good way to get a mental picture of what you are learning.  <br />The text is OK but cursory and does not add as much to the pictures.  However, if you would like to have a good set of Roman maps in a single, portable, location, this is an excellent choice.	2002-04-18

He tells amazing stories of fascinating, daredevil, behind-the-lines, eat-the-code-if-they-catch-you spys against the Germans.  <br />I agree with other reviewers that his tone is slightly self-congratulatory.  Even at 70-something (when he wrote it), he comes off as a slightly cocky little boy.  My greatest problem is that he goes over how the code works so very very fast that most readers will have a hard time understanding exactly what he did.  There is lots of jargon that he could have taken more time to explain (a double-key code??).  You end up feeling that Marks is just a little bit smarter than you and that THAT is why you don't quite follow him. <br />I would recommend reading this in combination with, or even after, Simon Singh's The Code Book, which explains how the codes work.  After you read Singh's book, Marks will be entertaining WITHOUT the frustration.	2002-04-06

Her descriptions of her youth and early marriage are harsh and sad but also beautiful.  <br />Press Review (NYTimes, NPR) seem to have focussed the oppressive nature of her marriage and the sexism inherant in ranching culture.  That's certainly present, but this book is definitely not an expose.  Go elsewhere if you are looking for gory details. But there is natural drama (the race through flooded roads to the hospital when her daughter is ill) and beauty (her description of the Missouri Breaks).  Her story about her relationship with Ajax the bull manages to be tough and tender at the same time. <br />I am a big fan of well-written (non-celebrity) memoirs, and this is one of the best I have read in a long time.

This was not practical on all rides but the guide said which ones.  The tips on early opening and &quot;commando plans&quot; were worth their weight in gold.<br />Our best trick was, go first thing in the morning, leave when it gets crowded, nap at the hotel, then come back in the evening.

(Ian Frazier started out as a humor writer.) His beautiful descriptions of the countryside he travels through, country you might otherwise think was much worth looking at.  His wonderful details about his family history make you feel like everyone's family is important.  <br />Since I first read this book, I have developed a true genealogy fixation, trying to recapture the feeling Frazier invokes in this wonderful book.  I wish he would write more.	2002-04-04

The story of Sister John's spiritual struggle with her epileptic visions is short and is told as simply as possible, like a biblical parable, and with a similarly powerful emotional effect.

Sacks is one of my favorite writers (with the exception of when he writes about ferns rather than people), but I think this is my favorite of all his books, even though it is in some spots uneven.

Such a blessing to have parents that support and revere Sacks' mad-scientist chemistry experiments:  when he came close to blowing up the house rather than forbid him to play with such chemicals they bought him a ventilation hood for his 'lab'). <br />But something dark also runs through his story--his parents' strange detachment (his mother had him witness autopsies, if I recall correctly)  and his brother's developing schizophrenia.<br />The total effect of all this is that the tone of the story sways from impersonal &quot;here's how such-and-such a chemical makes such-and-such a compound&quot; to a warm evocation of his intellectual and eccentric uncles (his darling Uncle Tungsten), to some of the stranger personal events that stop you short (his brother).  <br />In the end I completely forgave Sacks his wandering, because the book seems to replicate precisely how Sacks' mind actually works--one moment completely involved with people, one moment completely involved with science, one moment combining the two in a marvelous combustion that is a hybrid of chemistry and literature.<br />Some day I want to have him to dinner and hear the rest of the story.  What a guest he would make!	2002-04-01

She loves the people she writes about, and I appreciate that.  <br />But after hearing people fuss about this book I expected something a little less like a soap opera for a plot.  This is one of those books where the heroine does not notice that the handsomest kindest man in town is completely in love with her, where she makes up all kinds of reasons to treat him carelessly, for a couple hundred pages, and in the end when she realizes her mistake instead of running her off with a shotgun he just smiles and ding dong off we go to the chapel.  <br />And it turns out her dad wasn't really (fill in unsurprising plot twist here)....and in the end her family forgives....(fill in the next unsurprising plot twist here)....Don't want to ruin it for you folks but you can probably guess these without reading the book.<br />It's kind of a beach novel but the beaches are hundreds of miles away from the mountains of Big Stone Gap.	2002-04-01

Even though he was just learning, the exciting story about the boy racing his favorite sled dog to get prize money to save the family farm was gripping.  Not too hard or too long either.<br />Even though I am a grown-up, the ending surprised me and moved me.  It was exciting, and it made me think.  Kids, read it before they assign it in school!  Parents, if you have a reluctant reader, give this one a try.  You will even enjoy it yourselves.	2002-03-31

Only the Joy of Cooking gets an equal workout.  This book is the only vegetarian cookbook I've ever seen that:<br />1) Is comprehensive enough to cover every ingredient you have in your fridge (if you have a head of fennel and a potato, and nothing else, you will probably be able to find a recipe);<br />2) Is neither too far in the &quot;twigs pebbles and roughage&quot; camp nor the &quot;80 ingredients you never heard of and 3 hours you don't have&quot; camp.  Most recipes are reasonable in scope and actually flavorful, although if you want to create a fancy banquet you can.<br />Even if you are not a committed vegetarian (I'm not), but you just want to eat healthier, or to avoid the &quot;vegetables turning into science experiments in the fridge&quot; thing, this is a tremendous great resource.	2002-03-31

If you are looking for an uplifting Oscar-winning version of John Nash's life story, go see Russell Crowe.  This book requires fewer hankies (if you are a crier), but it is better, more entertaining, more involving, truer, and fairer than the movie.<br />Sylvia Nassar gives us as close a sense of what it &quot;feels&quot; like to be a mathematical genius as it is possible to get--even if you don't have any mathematical talents yourself.  And what's more she gives us as close a sense of what it &quot;feels&quot; like to be under the influence of schizophrenia (without being there yourself).  Although Nash does not appear a very nice man, he gets a fair and unbiased hearing in this book.<br />Other reviewers have complained about the lengthy introduction that helps explain the world of mathematics in mid-century.  I loved this part.  Without it, Nash's contribution would have been almost impossible to appreciate.  Nassar presents everything clearly and an a non-technical way, so I thought this part very interesting and useful.  <br />The book may be not &quot;just&quot; a biography, but a social history as well.  All good, from my perspective.  Definitely worth the effort!	2002-03-31

The plot of Tishomingo Blues has something to do with some Detroit gangsters using a Civil War battle re-enactment as the venue for shooting up some Mississippi gangsters.  Why they didn't just take a gun to the offending parties, I can't say.  It would have saved at least 100 pages. About half way through I lost track of who was doing what to whom.  I finished it but I still don't know.  If you crave resolution in the plots to your thrillers you had better avoid this one.	2002-03-30

This is really the book my family has been needing.  We want so badly to keep connecting with my father-in-law but it's hard to know how to hold a conversation with someone who rarely knows what time of day it is.  We love him and we want desparately for him to now that, but how?<br />Ms. Strauss offers a practical, informative, and hopeful guide, lists of 'dos and donts' rather than a medicial or theoretical guide.  Since I've had this book I have been able to connect to Pop in a much more rewarding way for both of us.  I highly recommend it to those who still want to connect!	2002-03-26

What most impresses me about Ava's Man is Rick Bragg's intense passionate need (and ability) to communicate the worthiness and value of his family, his people.  To show how people that don't look and talk fancy are just as worthy as people that do.  <br />But on top of that, there are some great stories in here--better than in most novels.  I love the part where his car ends up downstream and they think he's drowned but he's just stuck in jail.  I love how the family takes the eccentric Hootie like a puppy but still manages to treat him with great dignity.  I love the story about shooting that big old lady through the....well you'll have to read to find out I reckon.<br />Thanks Mr. Bragg...	2002-03-26

My 7-year-old's passion for reading has been largely fueled by the Time Warp trio.  If you are looking for something with boy heros that is engaging and VERY funny (from you kid's perspective), this is for you.<br />Girls too, especially those who appreciate a good booger joke now and then.<br />Makes those Magic Tree House kids look like the Brady bunch.	2002-03-24

I love this part of the country and I like Noah Adams, so I was happy to accompany him as a reader.  But there is not a lot more content than you would find in several All-Things-Considered segments stitched together...it won't take you much more time to read it than it would to listen to it.  The commentary is pleasant but if you want a deep or detailed introduction to the New River Valley of Appalachia you will have to go elsewhere.<br />So set aside a nice Sunday afternoon and have a go at it.	2002-03-24

Ross King can take the story of a small, seemingly insurmountable problem and turn it into an intriguing bit of drama:  how to build a dome without a frame to lean it on?  How to lift huge blocks of marble for the lantern off the ground, up into the sky, and over to the precise spot they are needed?  He moves easily back and forth from the intriguing rivalry between Brunelleschi and Alberti to the details of the dome's engineering.<br />It's even a nice reflection of the book's theme that the book itself is well designed.<br />Brunelleschi's Dome will have broad appeal to a lot of non-fiction readers: history buffs, archaeology, biography, engineering.  Based on the other reviews, the only folks who were disappointed are those expecting a highly academic, detailed account.  This is more of a charming, scientific and artistic fable....but true.	2002-03-24
US	53079427	R26XWCWHUQM3E4	067003035X	532654690	Polar	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Another history of a small place...	On the surface this is a kind of mystery/disappearance/whodunit kind of book.  But folks that's the surface.  On every other level it is a wonderful but eccentric biography of a place, a small town somewhere in the Blue Ridge, and what it feels like to live there...the humorous eccentrics, the odd kind of loneliness and loss the landscape evokes, the fundamental decency of most folks (including the eccentrics) and the threatening shallowness of strangers from outside.  <br />The place, the characters, and the feelings all point in the same direction.   I like that!  If you prefer straightforward thrillers this will be new to you, but give it a try.  If you prefer your local-color novels to be relatively plotless, this will be far too interesting for your tastes!	2002-03-24

I don't mind challenging reading or &quot;nature of memory&quot; stuff but this wandering from topic to topic reminded me of having a conversation with my 95-year-old great aunt, a likeable lady whose primary conversational gambit was the Endless Monologue.  <br />New characters appear without introduction and disappear so quickly that I could develop no emotional reaction to them at all.  Maybe that is his point, but it seemed almost arrogant for the author to assume that everything that crosses his mind is interesting.	2002-03-24
US	53079427	RTFCF3JHJWIJW	0385498373	530349664	The Forgetting: Alzheimer's: Portrait of an Epidemic	Books	3	21	31	N	N	A sincere and moving disappointment	If you read this book, you will be moved; if you have a loved one with AD, you will empathize (as I did), but you will not learn much that you did not already know.<br />It's obvious that the author is intensely involved in his topic and he manages to convey his feelings to his audience.  But the book wanders around, is often redundant, can't seem to decide what its basic premise is.  There are several separate stories about famous people in history who had AD (Emerson, the artist deKoonig, Reagan, etc.)  It is touching to hear their stories but I don't know what the 19-th century scholar Emerson has to tell us about a modern &quot;epidemic.&quot;  In at least one place the author gets bogged down in the personal battles for credit between researchers instead of focusing on the research.  His points at the end about the downsides of curing the disease (something to do with losing the insight about life that comes from watching memory loss, I think =--!!) are shortsighted and close to unintentionally offensive.<br />Finally, people might think from the title that the rate of Alzheimer's is increasing.  This is not actually what the author proposes, only that because there are more old people there is more Alzheimer's.  There is nothing in the book to support the idea of an &quot;epidemic,&quot; an increase in the chance of getting the disease should one live to old age.	2001-09-21

Even if you do not think of yours as a &quot;problem&quot; child, this book can help you steer around difficult moments and establish a more peaceful, less stressful home environment.  Our 5-year-old is bright and  social but has terrible tantrums around transitions like getting to school  and going to lessons.   Greene believes that all children want to behave  properly but some children must be taught to be flexible.  It really helped  us to see our son's issues as being learning- related rather than due to  laziness or bad attitude! <br />Greene's book gave us a simple, easy-to-follow  set of ideas about how to teach him  how to get past frustrating moments  without meltdowns.  Overnight, we have seen a significant improvement in  behavior - because WE know how to help him better!	2000-03-04

My son came home from pre-school reciting bits of the book after just one reading and begging to order it for home.  The illustrations are wonderful and the language is clever and fun.
