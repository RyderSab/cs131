Compared to David McCollough's book, \\"Washington's Crossing\\", at least as an audio book, is utter torture.  I can't imagine finishing this book if I had attempted to actually read it.<br /><br />I had hoped that this book would provide additional, interesting detail to supplement \\"1776\\", which I loved.  I particularly wanted to know more about the motivation of individual soldiers fighting for the American cause, but aside from some additional information about the Hessian army, I really can't say I learned anything from this book that I hadn't already heard in \\"1776\\".<br /><br />Admittedly, part of the problem with the audio edition is undoubtedly Nelson Runger's horrible narration.  He has the extraordinarily bad taste to read quotes translated from German with a faux German accent.<br /><br />But the text itself is simply boring and repetitious.  I kept thinking I had accidentally rewound the audio.  The story is so circular, I wondered if I were listening to passages out of order.  It's interesting to me that people who had read this book first seem to prefer it to \\"1776\\" - I can only say that I had the complete opposite reaction, having \\"heard\\" the books in opposite order.	2005-09-16
US	53091377	RYVCNF5YLKSR4	0345484320	745048719	Touchdown 2005: Everything You Need to Know About the NFL This Year (Andy Benoit's Touchdown: Everything You Need to Know about the NFL)	Books	2	3	5	N	Y	I really wanted to like this, but...	I first learned about this book when I read the \\"Talk of the Town\\" piece about the author in the New Yorker.  Andy Benoit is an 18-year-old resident of Boise, Idaho who has never attended an NFL game, but is clearly an avid fan of the NFL.  According to the New Yorker, he has been self-publishing an annual guide to the NFL since he was in the fourth grade, but this is the first year his book has appeared in print from a major publishing house.<br /><br />I expected some interesting, unusual analysis of the NFL, something I hadn't read or heard before.  I hoped Andy Benoit might be the Bill James of pro football, but what I got when I read the book is a somewhat entertaining but very conventional view of the NFL written by an 18-year-old recent high school graduate.  It's the sort of book that if you saw produced by a high school student you might find amusing, but you probably wouldn't pay for it, and you certainly wouldn't think to try to get it published.<br /><br />It's not that his observations are wrong exactly: they mostly encapsulate what everyone thinks about each player and team, with a few exceptions.  One exception, for example, is when he points out that although everyone says the Colts don't advance in the post-season because their defense isn't good enough, in fact their offense scored only 3 points against the Patriots in their playoff game last year.  While this is certainly true, it's not exactly an earth-shattering, paradigm-shifting analysis.<br /><br />I suspect that most fans who know their particular team well will find his analysis of their team to be a little off.  Again, he's not exactly wrong, but not as well-informed about a team's strengths and weaknesses as he could be.  For example, he makes it sound as though the Patriots were able to sign Hank Poteat (of all people, truly a replacement player if there ever was one, who has already been cut from the team) because they decided not to keep Ty Law.<br /><br />Another problem is that by the time the season is about the start, the book is already out-of-date, because many significant free-agent signings (for example, Corey Simon and Ty Law) occurred after the book was published.<br /><br />There really isn't any interesting statistical analysis in this book at all.  Just a lot of goofy metaphors and platitudes about players and teams.  For example, he says things like \\"write this down: Bill Parcells is not going to let the Cowboys play as badly as they did last year.\\"  Ok, great, but what exactly does that mean?  If they don't play better this year, what's he going to do?  Take away their birthdays?hat by the time the season is about the start, the book is already out-of-date, because many significant free-agent signings (for example, Corey Simon and Ty Law) occurred after the book was published. <br /> <br />There really isn't any interesting statistical analysis in this book at all.

Most of the publicity surrounding this book has focused on her experiences as one of the 15% of soldiers in Iraq who are women, and while that's reason enough to read it, the book is much more than that.  If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be a soldier in Iraq, or a woman stationed on a hilltop on the Syrian border, or a vegetarian enlisted in the Army, or an Arab linguist in the Middle East, you should read this book.<br /><br />It would not surprise me to see much of this book used as a primary source in business management and organizational studies texts.  She writes a lot about the leadership faults of people in positions of authority in the Army, and about her frustrations with incompetent management.  At one point she concludes that the Army is like a form of Communism.  A lot of her complaints about mistakes her leaders make are not really specific to the Army however and any manager in any organization can learn from this book.  For example, she often complains that she doesn't receive enough encouragement and reassurance that she is doing a good job. She's fairly typical of a lot of bright \\"individual contributors\\" who are smart enough to recognize faults in their leaders but do not yet have enough supervisory experience to learn how hard it is to be a leader.<br /><br />Ultimately she is very positive about her experience in the Army and although it is clearly not her intent, I think a lot of teenage boys reading this book could get the impression that a tour of duty in Iraq might be kind of fun. For this reason I would not want my 17-year-old son to read this book, because I don't want him to enlist.<br /><br />My only real complaint with the book is that she doesn't go into more detail on the many topics she covers.  I would love to know, for example, how exactly one goes about doing \\"signal intelligence\\": what frequencies they monitor, how successful are they at intercepting and understanding radio traffic in Arabic, and how it is that half of her team in Iraq are trained in Korean and not Arabic (what is it that they can do exactly?).  I would like to know more about what books she read while stationed on the Syrian border.  She says that \\"everyone\\" understood that the war was not justified and yet I have to think not \\"everyone\\" thought this at the start of the invasion.  I would like to know more about how people serving in Iraq would come to this conclusion.ing \\"signal intelligence\\": what frequencies they monitor, how successful are they at intercepting and understanding radio traffic in Arabic, and how it is that half of her team in Iraq are trained in Korean and not Arabic (what is it that they can do exactly?).

I listened to on my daily exercise walks in the Minuteman National Historical Park.<br /><br />The author is of course famous for his television narratives and does the reading of his own work on this set of 10 CDs. I enjoy listening to his voice immensely.<br /><br />The story, focussed as it is on the sequence of events in 1776, is entirely linear and very easy to follow while walking, even without illustrations. I don't even know what illustrations are included with the text edition.	2005-08-26

The variety and scope of the selections included in this anthology matched my (characteristically) eclectic itinerary well (Lucca, Padua, Venice, Assisi, Salerno), and the book's size and weight is appropriate to include with the luggage.<br /><br />If, like me, you never quite know what you are going to want to read once you are actually in Italy, this book is not a bad solution to the problem.<br /><br />In some ways I wish I had read the anthology before going, and packed the entire texts from a few of the original sources instead.  I particularly enjoyed the selections from Matthew Spender's book \\"Within Tuscany, Reflections on a Time and Place\\" and, more surprisingly, Susan Sontag's novel \\"The Volcano Lover\\". It's not clear however if something like \\"The Volcano Lover\\" would have been nearly so captivating if I hadn't first started reading it near Vesuvius.  I know, for example, that Shelley's poem \\"Stanza's Written in Dejection, Near Naples\\" probably wouldn't have grabbed me if I hadn't read it after a long lunch on a perfect Summer day, near Naples.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?  The chapters are ordered alphabetically by author's last name, which confused me at first (I'm kind of dumb) and struck me as a bit of a cop-out.  It was also confusing trying to figure out when the selections were originally written, which is particularly annoying when reading a non-fiction piece.	2005-08-16

I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of 15th Century Florence, with sheep grazing within the city walls.  The author emphasizes that Brunelleschi solved the problem of spanning the Duomo without the use of scaffolding or \\"centering\\" in a daring, revolutionary way.  There's only one problem with the story however: the author never explains what that daring, revolutionary way was exactly, and I am left scratching my head wondering what part of the story I missed.  It's possible that we simply don't know how Brunelleschi did it without \\"centering\\", but if that's the case, the author never says that.  I read this book twice in succession trying to understand this central, specific point, but failed to find any explanation anywhere in the text.	2005-08-15

It was a small guidebook for walks in Amalfi and Ravello, and I have cherished it ever since as a collectible.  It was not until I ordered and received this \\"Sunflower Guide\\" from Amazon that I realized that the two publications are by the same author, Julian Tippett.<br /><br />This book is primarily a detailed and excellent guide to walks along the Amalfi coast.  Its scope has been expanded to include some driving tours, which I think actually detract from its primary focus, and make some of the maps and itineraries a little confusing.  I would not buy this book for the driving tours only, but if you are lucky enough to be spending enough time on the Amalfi coast to really explore one or more of the towns (for example if you are spending the month of July learning Italian in Amalfi) then you should certainly buy this book.<br /><br />My primary interest is Amalfi itself, and although I have explored Amalfi on foot in the past, I have not yet tested the very detailed \\"trail\\" descriptions included in this guide, but I am reasonably confident in their accuracy.  This book is worth it to me for the very small-scale, detailed map of the town showing the location of the paper museum, which I have not been able to find in the past.  According to this guide, Amalfi is a lot more \\"three-dimensional\\" than I had imagined: it isn't just a one-street town running perpendicular to the coast.	2005-06-20

I've been a fan of the so-called \\"TCI\\" books for years; they are very popular among those whose hobby is exploring Italy, because of the tremendous insider's detail and information on the interesting small towns, all written from an Italian tourist's point-of-view.<br /><br />But, this new format is fantastic.  The book is divided into color-coded sections.  The red \\"Heritage\\" section is similar to a classic Michelin Green Guide description of the major cities in Tuscany - the illustrations and maps are outstanding (less spectacular and slick perhaps than the \\"Eyewitness Guides\\" but more to my tastes).<br /><br />What really sets the guide apart are the other sections however.  The \\"itineraries\\" section includes detailed descriptions on some really intriguing \\"industrial museums\\" including such things as the Salvatore Ferragamo shoe museum in Florence and the Piaggio motor scooter museum in Pisa, tourist attractions that were previously unknown to me.<br /><br />I would give the book 5 stars for the 40-page food section alone, if that were its only contents.  Not only do they list and describe all the different cheeses and sausages of Tuscany, I particularly appreciate the fact that they indicate which towns are especially famous for what type of Pecorino (for example).  Next time I'm in Grosseto, I'll know what cheese to look for.<br /><br />This is incidentally, the first guide to Tuscany (or Italy) that I have seen that goes into any kind of detail on Grosseto as a tourist attraction.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading travel guides, even if you have no specific plans to visit Italy.  I am really looking forward to additional TCI guides in this new \\"authentic\\" series.	2005-06-09

Over the years I have bought every new edition upon release.  I am sorry to report that the latest edition, the 7th, departs enough from the classic Green Guide concept to be a huge disappointment.<br /><br />The book is thicker than it used to be, with the addition of a few color photographs and the inclusion of a very limited number of restaurant and hotel recommendations.  Restaurant guides are never useful in Italy anyway (it would be difficult to find bad food anywhere in the country) and the hotel listings are so limited (one or two hotels in each major location) as to be a waste of space.<br /><br />The guide is now organized more along major destinations with excursions, rather than strictly alphabetically.  One of the things I always liked about the Green Guide was that you could see a destination on the map and instantly read about it to see if there were any highlights worth seeing.<br /><br />The Green Guide's greatest strength remains its system of prioritizing destinations and attractions.  I have rarely been disappointed by any sight given the maximum 3-star \\"worth a journey\\" rating by Michelin.  Most of the attractions of Italy have not changed since previous editions of this book: if you can find an earlier edition I recommend buying it instead of the seventh edition.	2005-04-25

I picked up this book because I thought the title was funny and I enjoy reading books like Beppe Severgnini's \\"Ciao America\\", another book written by an Italian about those crazy Americans.<br /><br />Dario Castagno's book is not nearly as caustic as I had been lead to believe by the jacket blurb, as well as some of the previous Amazon reviews, and the title itself.  It wasn't until I reached his chapter explaining the process behind the Palio that I really began to appreciate \\"Too Much Tuscan Sun\\" for what it is: a book written for Americans by a native Sienese.<br /><br />There are a few entertaining anecdotes throughout the book about some of the weird American tourists he has met, but the funny stories  he tells about American tourists say as much about him as they do about any of his clients.<br /><br />A certain percentage of his clients appear to be people looking for a broad introduction to Italy who really ought to be just following the latest edition of Frommer's Italy (which is a guidebook I still use and rely on) rather than hiring a local guide to show them the more obscure sites that mean something to him personally.<br /><br />I have been to a number of the tourist sites that Dario mentions as frequent stops on his tours, and I think that may help my appreciation of this book.  For example, I would never dream of taking an elderly person to see Monte Oliveto Maggiore, because there is a long walk downhill to the monastery from the parking lot.  Yet Dario tells the tale of trying to bring a busload of 20 elderly American tourists with predictably disastrous results.<br /><br />He also doesn't seem to understand that if two couples are calling him every 30 minutes with questions the night before a tour and leaving him waiting in the hotel lobby in the morning it's probably because one or both of those couples are engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the privacy of their hotel rooms, trying to decide how they are going to spend the remaining days of their relaxing Italian sojourn.<br /><br />I myself have been escorted by Italians to see recently excavated Etruscan ruins, and while Etruscan ruins may be especially thought-provoking to an Italian, I can understand why an American tourist might not find them quite so fascinating.<br /><br />I have also, personally consumed a lot of Diet Coke in Italy, and I found the number of times this American habit is mentioned to be hilarious (I think it has something to do with the fact that Americans, like me, are accustomed to drinking more liquid throughout the day, and we are trying NOT to gain TOO much weight when we are in Italy).<br /><br />But the main value of this book is the way it tries to communicate to Americans what an Italian really loves about his country, and what he finds particularly interesting about American culture.  I greatly appreciate his chapter on capital punishment, which I had previously recognized as probably the most bizarre aspect of American life, from the point-of-view of an Italian.ples are engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the privacy of their hotel rooms, trying to decide how they are going to spend the remaining days of their relaxing Italian sojourn.  <br /> <br />I myself have been escorted by Italians to see recently excavated Etruscan ruins, and while Etruscan ruins may be especially thought-provoking to an Italian, I can understand why an American tourist might not find them quite so fascinating. <br /> <br />I have also, personally consumed a lot of Diet Coke in Italy, and I found the number of times this American habit is mentioned to be hilarious (I think it has something to do with the fact that Americans, like me, are accustomed to drinking more liquid throughout the day, and we are trying NOT to gain TOO much weight when we are in Italy). <br /> <br />But the main value of this book is the way it tries to communicate to Americans what an Italian really loves about his country, and what he finds particularly interesting about American culture.

He does a good job of articulating \\"scenes\\": particular people at a particular time and place doing, saying, and thinking particular things.<br /><br />On some subjects he does stray from the particulars however and I felt that a few short audio tracks might help explain what he is talking about.  Nevertheless, I thought the insights he devulges about his creative process and his career influences were profound and fascinating.  This is the work of a genius divulging his inner dialogue.<br /><br />He explains that he realized he could only succeed as a song-writer and not an instrumentalist after watching Mike Seeger, a renowned virtuoso folk musician, play guitar one night.  The idea that it was his ambition to succeed for its own sake and not some unstoppable inner creative force that produced his repertoire is a revelation to me.<br /><br />It undoubtedly helps if you know his music well and are familiar with at least the major influences he cites.  I had no clue that he had heard and absorbed Robert Johnson before he recorded his first album with Columbia (John Hammond gave him a pre-release copy of \\"King of the Delta Blues Singers\\").  If you grew up listening to that album as well as Dylan's early albums you must read this book.	2005-04-04

Upon returning to the United States I was somewhat surprised to find that the book had been translated into English, and I read it, in English, in 1975.<br /><br />I recently read Guy Sajer's fascinating memoir \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" and it reminded me once again of \\"As Far as My Feet...\\"  I was pleased, and somewhat surprised, to see that it is still in print in English, and I've just read it again.<br /><br />This time, thirty years after my first reading, I found it nearly impossible to take the particulars of Bauer's story as literal facts.  I don't doubt that there was a man who escaped from a Soviet prison camp and managed to return to Germany, and his experiences may have been somewhat similar to the events described in this book, but somehow the narrative doesn't now strike me as particularly genuine.  It may be simply that in contrast to Gus Sajer's intensely personal account, Bauer's more professional narrative just doesn't measure up.  If anything, this book has a lot more in common with Gary Paulsen's \\"Hatchet\\" (a terrific story for a 12-year-old) than it does with a soldier's survival tale.<br /><br />In any case it's a good adventure story, especially recommended for a young adult reader.	2005-04-04

I was looking for a good, general introduction to Heidegger in English, my native tongue.<br /><br />I nearly fell out of my chair when I started reading it and realized it was not just merely a short monograph on Heidegger but an amusing attempt to discredit him and debunk all his theories.  Although I can't pretend to have anything more than a passing knowledge of philosophy (for example, I've never been sure if I correctly understand Kant's argument that causality is necessary), the description of Heidegger in Paul Edwards' book actually reminds me of my old norwegian philosopher friend, and thus I tend to believe Edwards' assessment of Heidegger's contribution to western culture.<br /><br />My apologies to those who have made the study of Heidegger their life's work.

If anything, given its format, this book would be even more accessible for a pre-teen reader than \\"German Boy.\\"<br /><br />For me personally, the biggest revelation in these stories is the repeated memory of children of running for cover from strafing fighter planes (\\"Tiefflieger\\").  Many of the children in this book mention this experience.  Anyone who has seen the PBS documentary \\"A Fighter Pilot's Story\\" will find these descriptions of the air war over Europe from the point of view of children walking home from Kindergarten particularly chilling.	2005-03-25

I am tempted to give it 5 stars however it is not quite as well-written or provocative as some other first-person war stories that come to mind, such as E.B. Sledge's \\"With the Old Breed\\" or Wolfgang Samuel's \\"German Boy\\", or even Viktor Klemperer's \\"I Will Bear Witness\\" (which two volumes combined are probably my favorite book).<br /><br />Sajer's narrative gets more and more interesting as he develops his voice.  Anyone who finds this book a bit tedious should be aware that the book really gets better after the first 100 pages.<br /><br />What is most fascinating to me about his story is his understanding of what he was fighting for.  For example, he is genuinely surprised to discover at the end of the war that France has not been on Germany's side in the war against the Bolsheviks.  There is a long passage in the middle of the book that attempts to reconstruct the sort of man-to-man talks his commanding officer would have with his troops late at night explaining the principles they were fighting for.<br /><br />In the book's most bizarre passage, Sajer expresses his anger at the terrorists (also known as partisans) for using tactics deliberately designed to provoke reprisals against civilians.  If it ever occurred to him later in life that he was guilty of participating in an evil undertaking, and that Nazi Germany had no right to invade Poland, or the Soviet Union, or to carry out reprisals against civilians, he never admits it.  In fact, it's my impression that even as an adult he never really understood that what Germany was doing was wrong.<br /><br />I read most of the book aware that there is some small controversy among World War II buffs about whether this is a novel or an actual autobiographical work.  The work certainly purports to be a genuine autobiography, and ultimately I think it is, although at certain points in the story Sajer assumes an omniscient viewpoint (translating long speeches in Russian for example, or explaining what happens to troops left behind on the East side of the river after he has crossed over and is in a hospital), although I think this is just sloppy writing.  His descriptions of Berlin while he is on leave remind me quite of bit of Remarque's World War II novel \\"A Time to Love and A Time to Die\\", but it has been years since I have read that.  A comparison of the two works might make an interesting term-paper topic for a literature student interested in military history.s in Russian for example, or explaining what happens to troops left behind on the East side of the river after he has crossed over and is in a hospital), although I think this is just sloppy writing.

I have just now, this evening, managed to finish it.  Considering that the book is only 132 small pages of large type, maybe as long as a short story in the New Yorker, the fact that it has taken me this many years to make my way through it should tell you a lot about how dull this narrative is.  The book has practically no plot, no suspense whatsoever, and all the depth and insight of a 22-year-old working in her first job at a large corporation.<br /><br />Why the two stars?  It is not incoherent, and it is sort of interesting to read the narrator's misconception that somehow her experiences are worth writing about.<br /><br />I can imagine that this book, in its original French, might make a good assignment for a second-year college course in the language for non-native speakers.

I have never read any of his work before and after having read Faithful I would consider reading more of his stuff, but unfortunately he has published so many books I literally wouldn't know where to begin.<br /><br />Stewart O'Nan's overbearing edits and contributions to the book alternate between boring, embarassing, assinine, annoying, and just plain stupid.<br /><br />For example, his favorite player is Brian Daubauch (just plain stupid), whom he insists are calling \\"Dauber\\" throughout the book (annoying).<br /><br />He devotes a large chunk of this book to describing how he goes about snaring baseballs in batting practice (boring) and getting innumerable autographs from players and managers (embarassing).<br /><br />In the second half of the book, he drones on and on about how he suspects that many games are rigged or fixed to create the highest possible fan interest and television ratings (assinine).  Why would anyone who thinks that major league baseball is rigged be a fan of the game, much less write a book about it?<br /><br />Finally, in the closing chapter, he decides to annotate Stephen King's far more interesting text with his own boring, assinine, embarrasing, annoying and stupid footnotes.<br /><br />For the most part, Red Sox fans will find Stewart O'Nan's contributions to \\"Faithful\\" to be infuriating.  On the other hand, if you are a Pittsburgh Pirates fan, like Stewart O'Nan, you may find his references to National League players like Roberto Clemente illuminating.<br /><br />If you were lucky enough to have written your own diary of the 2004 Red Sox season, you have no need to buy or read this book.  In fact, the rest of us would appreciate it if you were to find a publisher.of us would appreciate it if you were to find a publisher.	2005-02-21

Like many others, I was lead to it by Paul Fussell's \\"Wartime.\\"<br /><br />I have gained a new appreciation for the history of the Pacific campaign and will undoubtedly read more.<br /><br />Sledge's account is a little tedious at times as he makes an effort to nail down historical details of troop deployments, which are important but not particularly interesting to the average reader, but it hardly detracts from the impact of the book.<br /><br />If an expanded edition of this book were published with better maps and perhaps an expanded introduction by an historian I would surely buy it.  Fussell's introduction explains a little bit about how Sledge actually managed to keep notes in combat, which I found interesting and would like to know more about.	2005-01-04

It is reasonably well-written and contains a lot of information that seems still useful, but from the point-of-view of someone who doesn't know the field it leaves me wondering if I don't need a more up-to-date text.<br />For example, he mentions MPEG-3 in passing only as a failed improvement to MPEG-2 video, but isn't MPEG-3 (MP3) a wildly successful standard for audio?  I get the feeling that when he wrote the book 5 years ago this wasn't something that would occur to the average reader to ask, but in 2003 it just leaves me wondering how MPEG-2, MPEG-3, and MPEG-4 are related, if at all.<br />Another minor nit: for an introductory text he has a bad habit of using terms before he has introduced them.  This may be a product of updating an earlier text or simply bad editting, but for example, he uses the term \\"lossy\\" on page 5 but doesn't introduce the term until page 8.  Even though I think I know what \\"lossy\\" means, I got stuck on page 5 for about 5 minutes trying to figure out why I had missed a definition for this term.	2003-12-05

It has beautiful illustrations for things like &quot;how to upgrade your monitor&quot; (answer: &quot;buy a new one&quot;).  I give the book two stars because the pictures are so pretty, but if you have a Pentium II with 32 Meg of RAM running Windows ME you don't want to upgrade, you want to replace it with a new computer.  A nicely illustrated book with sensible advice like &quot;donate your old computer to charity&quot; or &quot;take it the dump&quot; wouldn't be worth the price of this book, but at least it would correct.	2003-11-14

People who survived ghetto life, concentration camps and death marches to write about their experiences were the exceptions, and invariably their stories include such amazing incidents.<br />However, a few incidents read like pure wishful fantasy.  I do not believe for example that Roman Frister actually snatched his girlfriend as she emerged from her marriage ceremony and drove her off for a three-day tryst in the mountains, before returning her to her groom...<br />Ultimately the fact that his narrative seeks to define its own reality is what makes the book very interesting.  The book is about what defines the self, what memory means, what is real, and what, if anything, really matters.

I have never read any of Tim Parks' books before and don't know much about soccer (I am an american) but really enjoyed reading this book regardless. I could not put it down, which is saying a lot when you consider the distractions while on vacation in Italy.<br />The book is a little odd in the way that it ignores \\"The Miracle of Castel Di Sangro\\" and tries to be something other than the McGinniss book, which I am really looking forward to reading.  Parks tries hard to convince himself that a book about the players' lives would not be interesting.<br />The author also seems to struggle with his allegiance to a group<br />of fans who are notoriously racist, reminding us for example that he has taught his son not to taunt the black players.<br />The book is written in \\"real-time\\" as a diary and throughout much of it Parks searches for a theme, trying to decide what kind<br />of book he is writing, about the fans, the players, sports as a substitute for religion.  Ultimately what makes this book<br />interesting is that it is about Italy.	2002-07-06

I would rate the book higher except that the hardbound volume is padded with numerous blank pages and title pages (two separate pages that say nothing but \\"Ciao Italia\\" for example), so I would recommend waiting for the paperback edition.<br />Severgnini's impressions of America are interesting if not profound.  Not a lot of detail really.  At least a couple of his observations I now see are typical of the Italian world-view, things I thought were specific to people I know personally.  For example, he mentions that the native Americans (Washingtonians) are quick to shed their winter clothes in the middle of a winter warm spell, but he and other Italians would never think to wear spring clothing out of season.  He is appalled that Americans cannot spell, and lists two pages of mispellings of his own name, which most Americans will not find remarkable.  Nor will Americans be surprised that journalists in the USA don't know Italian.<br />The book suffers a little bit from a narrow view of the U.S. based on living for one year in Washington, D.C.  A lot of what he describes as typical american life will strike Americans as \\"inside the beltway\\" stuff.  He even overestimates the significance of the National Spelling Bee, which most Americans think of as a kind of camp event, presumably because (as we all know) it is held in Washington.<br />But the wrong impressions, of which there are few, make for fun reading.  There really isn't a cult of people who like to eat Spam, nor is it really an integral part of American cuisine.<br />On the other hand, his observations are often right on, for example he truly understands what sort of people gorge themselves (and smoke) at a house of pancakes.	2002-06-01

Strangely, the author does mention the use of &quot;myself&quot; in place of &quot;me&quot; (thus, &quot;Jane played golf with Fred and myself&quot;) but seems to think people say &quot;myself&quot; because they feel it pretentious to say &quot;me&quot;.

I knew that Fussell would take inspiration from Graves but it wasn't until the end of this book that I discovered that he knows Samuel Hynes professionally.<br />Readers looking for a contrarian view of World War II should read Fussell's Wartime, one of my favorite books.  This is more of a personal autobiography which I enjoyed for what it is.  As it happens I enjoy reading about blood and guts but also about Poetics, so this is (also) my cup of tea.  He doesn't really get in gear until he gets into the war.  He could have added a lot more detail about growing up; he has a tendency to tell what his childhood was like rather than showing us, but the stuff about the poor training of the American infantry in World War II is really informative.  I also find it interesting to read what it was like to get a PhD in English at Harvard after the War, and I wish he had actually gone into more detail about this, but that's just me.<br />I am a little surprised that he didn't add some ghost stories here and there and more references to famous people, like Prime Ministers and famous poets.	2002-01-07

Also, it could have been printed on lighter stock paper to make it more travel-friendly.<br />The advice on what to do if abducted by space aliens is certainly appropriate to a worst-case scenario but makes me question the authors' sincerity.

This is a book of satellite images of Rome, covering essentially the entire city.  How cool is that?  Pretty cool, but how often have I looked at these pictures?  Not terribly often.  The resolution on the images is not quite good enough to see individual people.  If you've ever gotten lost in Rome trying to find the Pantheon, it is kind of interesting to look at where you might have just missed the right side street, but it is not as fascinating as you might hope.  One disappointment: remember that the Vatican is not part of Rome and is thus conspicuously absent from this set of photographs.	2001-04-10
US	53091377	R9WJYQRJVZKCU	0449207331	441215676	Iberia	Books	3	2	7	N	Y	Interesting period piece	I took this book on my 10-day trip to Spain.  Though I did not read it cover-to-cover, I enjoyed reading passages about places I had seen or  events I had read about.  It is a very dated account of Spain, but in many ways that is part of its  charm.  He refers to the Republicans in the Civil War on occasion as the &quot;Reds&quot; and at times seems to have  swallowed a Racion of Franco propoganda in one gulp. I found his description of the events of the siege of Toledo quite telling: he admits parenthetically that his account is based on one particular right-wing  book and that many of the facts he had subsequently learned were apparently a Fascist myth.	2001-03-22

My only quibble with it is that it gives directions for escaping from quicksand, without explaining that quicksand is itself a myth.  Nevertheless, if I am wrong, and there really is such a thing as quicksand, at least now I know how to survive it.  Finding oneself confronted with a mythological danger is indeed a worst-case scenario, after all.  I personally found the instructions for surviving a malfunctioning parachute to be the most valuable: I now know that if I am approached in mid-air by someone without a parachute that I should think twice about helping them, as the added weight is likely to break my arms when I pull my ripcord, and likely to break my legs when we land.	2001-02-22

There is something embarassingly amateurish about the book that nearly raises it to the level of camp.  The author has never lived in Italy, does not speak the language, doesn't seem to know any Italians personally, and does not appear to have ever experienced the most obvious way to &quot;satisfy your love affair with Italy&quot; (or if she has, doesn't want her husband to know about it).<br />Italophiles who don't really know the country might enjoy this book.  It is not exactly harmful, and in its own naive way rather charming and entertaining.  It is fun for example, to see which &quot;Italian&quot; movies immediately come to mind but don't make her list (&quot;Miracle in Milan&quot; and &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; are two that I don't see her mention).	2001-01-15

I was expecting a much more comprehensive listing, or at least a discussion about how these prints are appraised, but there are only a few price points mentioned.  There is quite a bit of useful information, but this is not the good, introductory text that I was hoping for.<br />At one point the author says something to the effect of: &quot;if you want to learn about Japanese Woodblock prints, go to a lot of galleries and read a lot of books on the subject.&quot;  I think I kind of knew that before.	2001-01-02

Young, foreign children making their first trip to Japan *must* read this book - their parents will love it too.  I really wish it had been available for my (then) 11-year-old son when we went to Japan in 1999; it would have prepared him for not just Sushi (he was looking forward to eating it but had no idea what it was and was somewhat appalled by the experience), but also for all kinds of funny and fun things to look for throughout Japan.<br />The book also functions well as an introductory Japanese phrase book for children.  Many of the expressions illustrated throughout the book were words that my son learned to speak in his 3 weeks in Japan.	2000-12-27

The descriptions of the Venture Capital business are extremely informative.<br />I burst out in laughter twice when reading about the shenanigans of his CEO.  On other occasions the author seems cruel: do we really need to know that Microsoft wanted to fire his VP of Engineering but that they gave him a meaningless job in Redmond instead, just to avoid the hassle?<br />Aside from the personal anecdotes, much of the industry commentary is sophomoric.  The author actually seems to think that having a PhD from MIT is an impressive credential.  The book reads like a very long article from Upside magazine and appears to have been written with as much care: I noticed two typographical errors in my hardback edition (pages 169 and 320).	2000-10-22

As one who majored for a time in German Literature and studied in Munich in the mid-Seventies, I had imagined this would have been an interesting time to be in Germany and was surprised when he spoke of it as a very depressing experience for him personally.  After reading \\"German Boy\\" I understand why he felt that way.  Until I read this book I never really understood what immediate post-war Germany was like for the natives.<br />Before reading \\"German Boy\\" my images of post-war Germany were mostly formed from reading Heinrich Boell novels and watching German film productions such as \\"Heimat\\" and \\"Wir Wunderkinder\\".  I had imagined somehow that as soon as even the Russians and certainly the British and Americans came to liberate the German people, the war was over for them, and prosperity followed rapidly.  Samuels shows in detail why for him and many people like him, the war did not end until really the Berlin Airlift and currency reform in 1949 brought a relative prosperity to at least his area of Germany.  For example, for about three years, from age 9 to 12, he basically wore the same clothes.  During this time he did not wear underwear until his Mother's future husband, an American GI, gave him a pair in 1949.<br />This is a very adult book written from the point-of-view of a pre-teen.  One of the major themes of the story is how his mother was forced to sell her body to feed her family.  He tells the story from the point of view of a boy who does not really understand exactly what sex is.  That understood, I think this would be an inspirational book for any 12-year-old boy, and I am going to encourage my own son to read it next.	2000-10-17

The parts I particularly remember are his accounts of pre-War ski trips with his friends, and his transition from a school boy to a member of the Wehrmacht - how he fought with such efficiency against African troops in France, and how his pre-War training prepared him for fighting.	2000-10-06

I have read<br />far more depressing accounts of the Holocaust (for example Alexander<br />Donat's great &quot;The Holocaust Kingdom&quot; which I also highly<br />recommend though more as a piece of Holocaust literature), but to me<br />Klemperer's diaries are much more profound than &quot;just another<br />survivor's story&quot;.<br />What distinguishes Klemperer's work is first<br />of all that he is a great writer - he was also, I think, something of<br />a hypochondriac, and extremely sensitive, so that events that might<br />have gone unremarked by someone less perceptive or less articulate are<br />described brilliantly, in real-time, as they occur.  For example, when<br />he remarks that the authorities have asked for a complete inventory of<br />all their possessions, and he wonders to himself why they would want<br />this, but matter-of-factly tells the Nazis what is his and what<br />belongs to his Aryan wife.<br />Klemperer is inspiring in the way he<br />describes his determination to complete his survey of French<br />Literature even as all his possessions are taken and long after he<br />could ever hope to find a publisher in Nazi Germany.  Some readers may<br />find his literary discussions boring, but I personally found it<br />particularly fascinating to read his comments on &quot;The Forsythe<br />Saga&quot;, for example.<br />There is enough material in these books to<br />form the basis of a semester-long undergraduate course.  In this<br />respect I would compare it to the &quot;Tale of Genji&quot; or<br />&quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;.  I hope that<br />college students will write term papers on themes in Klemperer's<br />memoirs for years to come.  It would be fascinating to trace<br />Klemperer's relationship with and attitude towards any one of a number<br />of people described in his diaries.<br />I have recently managed to buy<br />the original German edition ... as well as an abridged version in<br />German for young readers. I would love to see the abridged version<br />published in English and I would [love to see] a side-by-side<br />bilingual edition.  The publishers could also have included more<br />photographs (there is one photograph on the dust jacket of one of the<br />English-language volumes that is not included the bound text).

The cards themselves are smaller than I had imagined.  I  needed both sets to find all of the first 100 Kanji taught in first year  Japanese at Harvard (although I think 96 of these were in the first set).  The cards do not have Kana to identify the Kanji, and what is worse uses (I  think) Hepburn romanization, not the system used in Jorden and Chaplin that  I am more familiar with, and is more logical.  In other words they say  &quot;chi&quot; and &quot;ti&quot;.  In any case, I would much prefer that  they didn't use romanization at all, as I also need all the kana practice I  can get too!	2000-04-30

Unfortunately it doesn't work very well on my Gateway 500Mhz Pentium III with 128Meg running Windows 98.  I  was able to get the chapters to run on my machine only by copying all the  files onto my harddisk.  It is worth owning just to have the video, which  you can run with transcripts in romanji or English - definitely a great aid  to memorization.  The primitive interactive features where you can  supposedly play the part of one of the actors hardly worked at all.  This  may have been a Mac application ported to Windows 3.1.  You should  definitely buy this CD-ROM but be forewarned that you may need to do some  creative hacking to get it to run on Windows 98.	2000-02-13

I had read positive things about it online, and tried to follow the tour of Ginza as described in the book.  It was  extremely confusing, and after only much effort I managed to find the sites  described, which turned out to be extremely uninteresting (some souvenir  stores going out of business).  I then accidentally left the book at a  SegaWorld and was not able to find it again.  No great loss.  I would give  it fewer stars if I hadn't lost the book - I am giving it the benefit of  the doubt!	2000-01-16

The impulse to  speak Japanese whenever you try to speak any foreign language.

I would give it 5 stars except  that for a short book, it is a little hard to get through.  Some of the  observations on life, death, marriage, and photography seem a little  sophomoric or naive.  But highly recommended nonetheless; it would be a  great book to pack on an extended vacation in Japan.	1999-08-30
