My girlfriend got it for me. I normally don't read about subs as I am interested in Nuclear Weapons and Hazardous Device Disposal. What a pleasant surprise to find that the book is written by one who was involved with one of the biggest EOD Nuclear evolutions in the published literature - the Palomares incident.<br />This book is the true definition of a sleeper. The first couple of chapters did little to entice me. In fact his &quot;I-me-I-did-this&quot; attitude and lack of refined writing skills put me off a little bit. By the end of the book, I was completely hooked, and hoping he writes another book before he passes away.<br />You see, his involvement with submersible operations put him squarely in (under? lol) the center of many notable Cold War events. His take on things, bolstered by the fact he was an actual participant in many, put several operations in a totally different light for me.<br />One such event was the true story behind Clancy's 'Hunt' book. Up until I read Craven's book, I thought the retellings of the operation were, too, well, Hollywood. Craven's explanation makes perfect, although chilling, sense, and has the ring of clarity and truth.<br />Another topic was the Hughes / CIA Glomar Explorer.Many things about that operation made NO sense to me, until I read this book. While Craven is reticent to divulge many details, his explanations are like a knowledgeable individual peering over your shoulder as you watch and read other treatises on events. <br />I recommend this book, with the caveat not to concentrate on the author as much as the events. In this light, this is an excellent and worthy next acquisition.	2004-03-03

Not so much focused on the weapontry as the plants and the people, the photography is insightful. What is especially interesting is the second half; entitled interviews and field notes. Del Tredici shares with us the back stories he learned behind his excellent photography. While not a step-by-step guidee by any means, it nonetheless puts a face on the cult of the atom at the ground level.	2003-07-10

Listening to the other reviews and looking at Amazons' look inside feature, what I expected was a thick paperback containing a large amount of information on all of the landmines in the inventory, and the approved EOD method for rendering them safe.<br />What I got was a book that barely fit on my shelf, much less a BDU pocket. It contains the notes of a well-respected gentleman that he homogenized from multiple various sources.<br />He states that one of the reasons for the book is that the publications for use by EOD personnel are normally not available to the deminer. In many countries, UXO personnel are not EOD people, they are conscripted from the local population. Unfortunately, many of the items do not list a method for neutralization, and the section on rendering safe is very, very, VERY generalized. The ones that do list disarming and neutralization procedures do so supposing that the reader already has attended a course of instruction in explosives disposal.<br />I wouldn't feel safe using the book in the field. I understand the need for classification, but nothing about landmines, which by nature are left behind to be collected for study and reverse engineering by any coutry with an interest, truly needs classification when you weigh the need of the deminer to safely remove them.<br />Also, possibly off topic, I would have liked to seen a greater number of submunitions listed.<br />In sum, the book has its' points, but it falls short of being the publication it could be. A book of this type has a very necessary place in demining operations, and with some more fleshing out, this book could fill that role.	2003-07-10

The book, reading like excellent fiction, is chock full of facts and trivia; enough to satisfy even the most technically - oriented reader.

William Laurence was a newspaper reporter, that was one of the first in now what we are used to routinely seeing: a tagalong. Laurence was allowed to tour some of the Nuclear Weapons facilities, interview the key players, and even was present for the dropping of the device on Nagasaki. It is fascinating to listen to a reporter who is pro-nukes, and how he tries to retain secrets that we now all know. The book ends on a positive note, listing the many proposed uses of nuclear power, many of which we see every day, such as nuclear medicine. This is a hard book to find, and a good addition to a nukeheads' shelf.	2003-06-05

Now, it's an excellent addition to the must - read list of any one interested in nonproliferation. Divided into several sections, the book discusses every facet of nuclear terrorism, the how, the where, and the why.

Face to face with the Bomb is a slightly misleading title. A coffee - table treatment of the subject of nuclear weapons, this 121 page book represents the culmination of a many-year journey of the author, Paul Shambroom as he visually recorded his observances of the cult of the nuclear weapon system.<br />Mr. Shambroom, through his writing in the oversized tome, is apparently anti - nuclear weapons. But, through his encounters with the various military complexes ( the Department of Energy steadfastly refused his repeated requests to visit), he appears to have learned the truth; that the people that protect the United States from aggression aren't evil, that the shiniest sword in our scabbard, the nuclear weapon, isn't inherently evil, and that the price of freedom is a costly one.<br />Unfortunately, the title is a bit misleading. From the cover photo, and the title, I was hoping for a book of bomb photos. In the post 9-11 world, such imagery is fast disappearing. While there are a few photographs of actual nuclear weapontry, the majority of the book is filled with the supporting cast and crew; pictures of submarines, of aircraft, of command and control centers.<br />All of the photography is compelling. Unfortunately, it is shot through the eye of the unknowing. In several frames, through innocence or intent, things that I would liked to have seen, because they've never been publicly exhibited, trail off of the edge of the photo. His attention to detail and composition is excellent, but I would've preferred that his interest focus on the end item, the bomb, and not on the delivery systems.<br />In sum, if you are looking for weapons photos, I recommend the purchase of a used copy of this book. If you are curious about a basic slice of the secret life of nuclear weapons, go get a copy of this now. For the hard - core nukeheads, I vote we find the author, and see if he will exhibit the remainder of the negatives!	2003-06-02

This book was written by Chuck Hansen in 1988. It represents the sum total of all of the releasable information on the United States Nuclear Weapons Program at that period. <br />The volume is chock full of photographs, facts, figures, dates, places, and names. There is *NO* fluff. For many years, it has been *the* reference book on US Nuclear Weapons Systems. It explains very well the theories behind how the sytems operate, broken down into sections such as, nuclear weapons physics, arming, fuzing and firing, weapons systems types, etc. This book graces the shelves of every subject matter expert. Look at the more knowledgable articles on the subject; they all reference this book in the appendix. Unfortunately, there were only a few printings. For this reason, it has become scarce, and expensive when it does appear ( I paid ($$$) for my exc/exc HB copy). <br />I possess just about every tome on the subject. There is no other book that covers the same ground with the same detail as this one. It simply is the encyclopedia of Nuclear Weapons Non-Sensitive / Unclassified Information.<br />	2002-12-17

While I do not own this CD, I have seen what is on it. What the maker of this disk does is go to a DoD website, download (for free) all the publications there, then segregate them according to subject header.<br />If you purchase this, all you will get is Service and Technical Bulletins, with an occasional Technical or Field manual. While they may help you to identify some US ordnance, and might help you to understand the EOD mission, there is nothing on here applicable to EOD Technical Operations. It's mostly Ammunition Servicablilty Procedures and white papers.<br />The actual publications that reference the identification and rendering safe of ordnance, US and foreign, called the 60 series, are Classified Confidential Publications, and (hopefully) will never be for public sale.<br />....<br />PS - It's spelled ORDNANCE, not ordinance.	2002-08-28

Contained within is simply a list, probably pinched from an OSHA guide, of reactive liquid chemicals that may explode when mixed. Period. Persons wanting a how-to guide with step - by -step instructions for collecting, assembling and employing a binary chemical Improvised Explosive Device will be sorely, sorely disappointed.

While not revealing anything of an operational or technical nature, so as not to  tip the hand to the bombers, the author leads us through a whirlwind tour of many places angels fear to tread.

Repackaged under another title, it is an excellent beginners' book for those interested in Improvised Explosive Disposal, especially first responders. In vivid detail are the various methods of fuzing and firing IED's. The second half discusses the use of det cord to open suspect packages, as well as the results of testing a 'new' IEDD tool, the 12 ga shotgun.<br />For those who have a good foundation in the basics, it would make a good pub library addition in the ... dollar range.

This book, however, kind of misses the mark.<br />On the plus side. the book is actually a work of several authors; each treating a seperate (and diverse) topic. The culminated work, in very small type face, is a few pounds heavy.<br />On the minus side, very little actually touches on specific weapons systems. Albeit,there is a great section on arming, fuzing, and firing systems, worth the price of the whole book, the majority of the book touches on policy, communications, and command/control issues, most of which was rendered moot by Ronald Regan and the end of the cold war.<br />If you are interested in Policy Issues of the 80's, you will LOVE this book. If you wanna see the guts of a W-80, I heartily recommend anything by Chuck Hansen or Richard Rhodes. Money better spent.......	2002-02-20

However, I guess I was expecting more of a technically detailed history of Iraq's NWEPS program, than an autobiography.<br />This book centers on the writer, who thinks of himself as the centerpiece of Iraq's nuclear bomb-building efforts. Just enough technical detail is included to whet the appetite of the reader.
