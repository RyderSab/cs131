(I wasn't particularly interested in horse racing or the architectural history of Chicago, but in both cases, the authors did such compelling research, I became engrossed.)<br />I think the only readers who might be disappointed are those in search of a gory account of the crimes of Mudgett/Holmes. The hardcore true crime fans might prefer Harold Schechter's &quot;Depraved&quot; instead.	2003-02-16

However, the book seems skimpy and rushed into publication. <br />When I put it down, I thought of how much more impact this story could have had in the hands of a mature writer, such as Margaret Atwood. That said, if you like Atwood's brand of dark wit, you might enjoy this first-time novelist.	2002-03-03

(The author seems particulary peeved with Sante, taking his work to task on several niggling points. He also takes potshots at Herbert Asbury.)<BR>I felt the book's weakest aspect was its treatment of the New York Draft Riots. The strongest section is the description of the transition of Five Points from a predominantly Irish and Italian slum to present-day Chinatown.<BR>The book is organized in a series of vignettes and capsulized biographies that make it difficult to follow a timeline. Perhaps it would have been better to divide the book into a pre-Civil War section and post-Civil War section.<BR>Buy the book if you are passionate about the history of New York and seek something lighter (!) than &quot;Gotham&quot;. If your interest is less scholarly, get a copy of Sante's &quot;Low Life&quot;.	2001-08-29

You'll probably wish you had borrowed it from the library instead...<br />This is not a keeper. The &quot;shocking incident&quot; at the train station that precipitates the heroine's coma is a cheat. There are flashes of nice writing, but this book does not live up to the hype. It reminded me a lot of Twilight, another critical fave from a few years ago. The book used the same device to better advantage.	2001-06-19

More distressing, the authors knew this and chose to perpetrate the lie anyway.<br />However, Misty Bernall is one of the most compelling monsters in contemporary fiction. The idea of a child entrusted to her care is more chilling than any high school shooting.<br />Madeline L'Engle did so much fine work. It is truly a shame that she would fall in with such bad company.	2001-06-03

Offensive? Yes. But not entirely inaccurate. This is not your &quot;feel good summer beach read.&quot;<br />This is the kind of book that comes out of writers' workshops. Overwrought and over-long with symbolism overwhelming story at every turn of page.<br />Mineral Palace is bleak and tedious. Too many plot points end up being pointless. And how do such cardboard characters withstand such raging duststorms? <br />As a work of fiction, I don't care whether this is an accurate depiction of Pueblo in the 30s. I do care that I was lured into this town with the promise of a good story and left with just a few stunning images (The Buffalo Mass Suicide).	2001-04-26

Sometimes magical realism gets a little too cloying for my taste, but Hoffman cuts the sweetness with a little acidity and tang. As a Florida native, it's nice to see a writer really get the sense of place right. Even though Verity is fictional, it's so compellingly described you half believe you've seen that exit on the Florida Turnpike.	2001-03-16

He has no grasp of its cultural impact and substitutes sneers for his usual insight (Ok, it's usually snarky insight, but still...)<br />The Fort Bragg piece is also weak. It reminds me of a Made for TV movie. Media opportunism isn't exactly a newsflash.	2001-01-26

In lively and unpretentious prose, she presents outrageous behavior with deliciously wry understatement. I hope other academics take note. I've read several popular histories recently that featured great material dulled down by excrutiating &quot;academese&quot; and intrusive commentary. (They seem to be close-captioning their work for the insight-impaired.) Dunlop lets her cleverness come through in her selection of characters and scandals that represent a time gone by -- yet seem all too familiar.	2000-12-22

The prose is as succulent as a ripe plum. I am NOT a nature lover ... more like Woody Allen, who said &quot;nature is what I have to walk through to get to my car&quot; ... yet the vivid observations on flora, fauna and that other earthy f-word captivated me.	2000-12-13

It may be interesting to those who don't know much about profiling. However, Mindhunter is a much better book than this recycled effort, which seems to have been written primarily to justify his support of the Ramseys. Regarding the Ramsey case, he presents a few credible scenarios incriminating Paty and/or John, and then immediately dismisses them as &quot;absurd&quot;. His ego seems to have created quite a blind spot.	2000-12-13

I am knee-deep in research works on NYC in the Gilded Age and &quot;Low Life&quot; is by far the most entertaining, thorough and evocative book I've found. I've reread most chapters several times and I always come away impressed. If you enjoyed the fictional accounts of this time and place by Caleb Carr and EL Doctorow, treat yourself to &quot;the real thing&quot; and dig into Luc Sante's book.

Thow away your stale Popcorn ... if the cheesy, superficial nature of most futurists put you off in the past, get both of the books by Strauss and Howe. There's real substance here and a predictive model you can use to become your own think tank. There is also a touch of humor -- as befits the pedigree of one of the authors (a founder of the Capitol Steps). Anyone with imagination and insight will find many ideas they can put to good use -- and be entertained and challenged as they do. To give this book enough thumbs up, I would need more hands.	1998-06-17
